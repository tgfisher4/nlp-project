WASHINGTON -- — The Atlanta Braves snapped their season-starting four-game losing streak by edging the Washington Nationals 7-6 in a doubleheader opener Wednesday with the help of three hits from Ronald Acuña Jr. and a save by Will Smith a night after he gave up a walk-off hit.	Smith, Atlanta’s fifth pitcher, didn't have an easy time of things, though. The first batter he faced Wednesday was Juan Soto, whose RBI single in the ninth inning delivered a 6-5 victory for Washington on Tuesday.	This time, Soto led off the bottom of the seventh by walking, Starlin Castro drove him in with a double to cut Atlanta's two-run lead in half. Another walk by Smith put the winning run on base with one out, but Andrew Stevenson grounded into a double play to end it.	Even though spectators were present — unlike last season, when they were banned —- there still was fake crowd noise piped in, offering an odd, and annoying, hum of a soundtrack.	With nary a cloud interrupting a crystal blue sky, and a temperature of 75 degrees at first pitch and climbing, the teams combined for 11 runs after merely two innings of the first seven-inning game.	The Nationals batted around in the first against Max Fried and scored four; Trea Turner's two-run shot, his second homer in two days, was the highlight.	The Braves sent nine men up in the second and plated five against Erick Fedde to lead 6-5; Acuña, Travis d'Arnaud and starting pitcher Fried were among those who drove in runs.	Fedde (0-1) only got five outs. Fried recorded six and was followed by Josh Tomlin (1-0), who threw two hitless innings and was credited with the win.	Atlanta tacked on an insurance run in the seventh on a wild pitch by Wander Suero.	Washington is missing nine players because of a coronavirus outbreak that led to the postponement of the team's first four games. That included Monday's series-opener against Atlanta, which was shifted to Wednesday.	Four players tested positive for COVID-19, and another five who would have been on the 26-man roster are under quarantine because they were identified through contact tracing as having potentially been exposed to the illness.	Two of the additions from the Nationals' alternate training site — a group that one of them, catcher Jonathan Lucroy, likened to “The Replacements,” the 2000 Keanu Reeves film about football players filling in during a strike — made their MLB debuts: Cody Wilson flied out as a pinch-hitter and lefty reliever Sam Clay struck out two in a scoreless inning.	In the doubleheader's second game, 2019 World Series MVP Stephen Strasburg was slated to make his first start for the Nationals since being shut down after just five innings last season because he needed carpal tunnel surgery on his right wrist.	Reliever Huascar Ynoa was Atlanta's likely starter in Game 2.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: Players under quarantine could rejoin the club on its upcoming six-game road trip, manager Dave Martinez said. “It’s a possibility. It really is,” Martinez said. “The good news is these guys are testing negative with the nasal swab and the saliva test.”	UP NEXT	Braves: After a day off, play their home opener Friday against the Phillies, with Charlie Morton starting for Atlanta against Zack Wheeler.	Nationals: Planned to fly to California on Wednesday night; after a day off, they open a three-game set at the Dodgers on Friday. Martinez wanted his players to get a chance to rest and adjust to the time difference. “It’s been a long week,” he said. "It’s been a long week for all of us.”	------

CINCINNATI -- — The names might not ring out like Rose, Morgan, Bench and the Big Red Machine.	But Tyler Naquin, Nick Castellanos, Jonathan India and these Cincinnati Reds are breaking loose for runs in bunches.	Naquin hit another leadoff homer and the high-scoring Reds kept rolling, backing Luis Castillo to rout the Pittsburgh Pirates 11-4 Wednesday for their fifth straight win.	Coming off their first playoff appearance in seven years, the Reds have started a season 5-1 for the first time since 2016.	“The determination to win games is there,” Reds manager David Bell said. "And by no means do I sense any sort of letup. Guys are way too smart for that. They know what’s ahead of us.”	Their 56 runs are the most in Reds franchise history through the first six games of a season. The 1976 team with Morgan, Rose, Bench and Tony Perez scored 51 en route to a second straight World Series championship.	The Pirates absorbed the brunt of Cincinnati’s rampage this week, outscored 30-8 in the three-game series sweep.	“We’re definitely ready to get out of Cincinnati,” manager Derek Shelton said.	Naquin jumped on Chad Kuhl's first pitch for his second career leadoff home run, and second in as many days. He became the first Reds batter with leadoff home runs in consecutive appearances since Eddie Milner on June 24-25, 1984.	A day after hitting two homers and driving in seven runs, Naquin started the Reds toward another romp by keying a five-run first inning.	“I’m really happy for Tyler," Bell said. "He’s getting some opportunities here early and he’s absolutely made the most of it and been a big part our first week.”	Castellanos homered in the fifth. Tyler Stephenson and Aristides Aquino hit back-to-back home runs in the eighth.	Castillo (1-1) neatly bounced back after allowing a career-high 10 runs on opening day to St. Louis. He shut out the Pirates on four hits for seven innings, striking out five and walking one.	“The catcher was calling my changeup, and it was working today," Castillo said. "It is my second-best pitch. I didn’t (need to) throw my slider.”	Erik Gonzalez hit his first career grand slam in the Pirates ninth off Amir Garrett.	Kyle Farmer's two-run double capped the big first off Kuhl (0-1).	“It starts with the energy in the clubhouse," Farmer said. "Guys are hot right now. When everything is rolling well, hitting is contagious. So it just keeps rolling, and it’s a lot of fun to watch.”	RUNS BATTED INDIA	Reds rookie second baseman Jonathan India drove in three runs on Wednesday, giving him 10 RBI in his first six games. India is batting .476. He also threw a runner out at the plate.	“I’m confident out here," he said. “No nerves. I’m just playing the game I know how to play. This is my dream. It’s everything I expected and more.” India's two-run double in the fifth came after he was hit in the helmet by a Kuhl pitch in the third. “I wasn’t dazed at all,” India said.	CRYING THREE RIVERS	The Pirates mercifully return home to PNC Park to begin a seven-game homestand after dropping five of six on the road to begin the season. “We just need to flush these games away,” Shelton said. “(The Reds) just banged on us, hit the ball out of the ballpark. We're ready to go home."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: OF Jesse Winker, who hasn't played since leaving Saturday's game due to a flu-like illness, resumed baseball activity on Wednesday and could return to the lineup on Friday. Winker hasn't tested positive for COVID-19. “It wiped him out a little bit,” Bell said.	NEXT UP	Pirates: Play their home opener on Thursday against the Cubs with LHP Tyler Anderson making his second start of the season against Chicago. He struck out seven but took the loss on Saturday after allowing three runs over five innings.	Reds: Begin their first road trip of the season on Friday in Arizona. RHP Tyler Mahle looks for his second win of the season after allowing two earned runs through five innings in Saturday's 9-6 win over the Cardinals.	------

CLEVELAND -- — When José Ramírez’s shot to deep right field narrowly missed being a home run, Shane Bieber knew what was coming next.	A legit one.	“Foul ball, homer, foul ball, homer,” the Cy Young Award winner said. “You know he’s on it and he’s going straighten it out. Sure enough, he did.”	Ramírez’s second two-run homer of the game snapped a tie in the eighth inning and sent the Cleveland Indians to a 4-2 win over the Kansas City Royals on Wednesday after Bieber struck out 12 for the second straight game.	Ramírez's one-out shot in the eighth off Greg Holland (0-1) gave the Indians their first home win in 2021 after they were shut out 3-0 on Monday.	In the sixth, Ramirez, who was fooled by a pitch and struck out in his first at-bat, hit a long foul to right before connecting for a two-run homer to bring in Cleveland's first runs at Progressive Field this season.	“This just in,” Indians manager Terry Francona said. “Josey’s pretty good.	It was the kind of performance the Indians have come to expect from their All-Star third baseman, who finished second in the MVP voting last season and third in 2017 and 2018.	“He’s a gamer, man,” Bieber said. "It never turns off. Whether it’s going good or it’s not, he’s the same guy and he brings that same energy and that’s why we rely on him so much. Not just physically, but as a leader in the clubhouse, the way he goes about everything.	“Really can’t say enough about the guy. He comes up in big moments like he did today and that’s why he’s our guy.”	Emmanuel Clase (1-0) pitched the eighth — all nine of his fastballs were over 100 mph — and Nick Wittgren worked the ninth for his first save since Sept. 4, 2019.	Salvador Pérez homered for the Royals.	Bieber had his second strong start of the season, fanning 12 and allowing just two runs and three hits in 6 1/3 innings. But the right-hander remains winless as the Indians continue to struggle at the plate through the season's first week.	The right-hander extended his streak of striking out at least eight to 14 games, tying Corey Kluber’s club record.	Hall of Famer Randy Johnson holds the major league mark with 17 in a row.	The Indians only got three hits Monday, and they didn't get a runner to second through the first five innings against Kansas City starter Jakob Junis, who was only slated to pitch a few innings in what was supposed to be a bullpen game.	“I thought I was going two innings,” said Junis, who gave up one hit in five innings. “I didn't think in a million years I'd go five innings.”	It was 73 degrees and sunny when Bieber threw his first pitch, a 41-degree jump from opening day last week in Detroit, where he pitched in swirling snow over the first few innings.	Pérez ripped Bieber's first pitch of the fourth into the trees beyond the center-field wall to put the Royals ahead 1-0.	SHOT IN THE PARK	With an early-season off day, half of Cleveland's roster received COVID-19 vaccines on Tuesday. Francona said the Cleveland Clinic administered the shots at Progressive Field.	Francona understands there may be players who don't want to get vaccinated — for a variety of reasons.	“That’s everybody’s personal choice,” he said. “You can’t make somebody do that. That wouldn’t be right. I hope we get to a certain amount though, where we are able as a team to relax some of the restrictions. That would be helpful.”	ROYAL SALUTE	Kansas City's Carlos Santana received a warm ovation before his first at-bat in Monday's opener as Cleveland fans thanked the popular first baseman for 10 seasons with the club.	He appreciated the gesture.	“Respect,” Santana said when asked about the cheers. “Respect the fans, respect the team. Respect the city. Respect the organization that gave me the opportunity for 10 years.”	DAY AFTER DAY	The Royals are opening the season with eight straight day games, the club's longest run of afternoon baseball since 1979. Kansas City is scheduled to play 62 days games in 2021, which would match the 1971 Royals for the most in team history.	UP NEXT	Royals: Begin a three-game series in Chicago on Thursday with RHP Brad Keller going against RHP Lance Lynn. Keller lasted just 1 1/3 innings in his opening-day start.	Indians: After another off day, Cleveland opens a three-game series against Detroit. Zach Plesac (0-1) will face RHP Julio Teheran (1-0), who beat the Indians last weekend.	------

DETROIT -- — Jorge Polanco hit a two-run double in the sixth inning and the Minnesota Twins held off Akil Baddoo and the Detroit Tigers 3-2 on Wednesday.	Baddoo hit an RBI triple and threw a runner out from left field — another impressive day in this stellar start to his big league career. But the rookie was doubled off third after his big hit — it was a rough day on the bases for the Tigers, who also ran into two outs at home in the sixth.	Wilson Ramos homered for Detroit, and Matthew Boyd (1-1) allowed three runs in seven innings.	Kenta Maeda (1-0) pitched six mostly strong innings, allowing two runs and seven hits. He yielded two singles, a double and a walk in the sixth, but Detroit didn't score.	Willi Castro was thrown out at home for the first out while trying to score from first on Miguel Cabrera's double. Then, with the bases loaded, Jonathan Schoop hit a fly to right. Kyle Garlick caught it and threw Cabrera out at home — with Baddoo waiting on deck.	“What a relief," Maeda said through a translator. "If it weren’t for those two plays, I don’t think our team win would have been there.”	Castro said he paused a bit on Cabrera's hit, since left fielder Jake Cave tried to make a diving catch. Cave got up quickly and threw to shortstop Andrelton Simmons, who made the throw home to retire Castro.	“Obviously that’s an aggressive play, and there’s no outs," Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said. "I think it was more about them executing.”	Polanco, who was thrown out twice at home himself in an extra-inning loss Tuesday, got his key hit after Castro was unable to field Nelson Cruz's hard two-out grounder to the shortstop. That infield single left men on first and second, and Polanco drove them both home to erase a 2-1 Detroit lead.	Cruz was initially called out on his hit — Schoop, the second baseman, fielded the ball after it bounced off Castro and threw to first — but the call was overturned after a video review.	“That’s a really big play," Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. "It looked like a really close play from the dugout.”	Baddoo homered on the first pitch to him in his major league debut Sunday. Then he hit a grand slam Monday and a game-winning single Tuesday. His triple put the Tigers up 1-0 on Wednesday.	“Akil’s in the middle of everything," Hinch said. “The damage that he’s done so far, he’s not going to get a lot of free strikes. That word gets around the league.”	Willians Astudillo tied it with a sacrifice fly in the fifth. Ramos hit a solo homer in the bottom of that inning.	Alex Colomé pitched two innings for his second save.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Twins: Minnesota put OF Brent Rooker on the 10-day injured list with a cervical strain. The Twins selected the contract of LHP Brandon Waddell from the taxi squad.	UP NEXT	The Twins play their home opener Thursday against Seattle. José Berríos (1-0) starts for Minnesota against Marco Gonzales (0-0). Berríos pitched six no-hit innings at Milwaukee in his previous outing.	Detroit has the day off, then starts a three-game series at Cleveland. Julio Teheran (1-0) takes the mound Friday night for the Tigers against Zach Plesac (0-1).	------	Follow Noah Trister at www.Twitter.com/noahtrister	------

BOSTON -- — Christian Vázquez homered, Xander Bogaerts had three hits and J.D. Martinez went for extra bases for the seventh game in a row on Wednesday to help the Boston Red Sox beat the Tampa Bay Rays 9-2 and complete a three-game sweep.	Nathan Eovaldi (1-1) allowed one run, three hits and three walks over seven innings with seven strikeouts. The Red Sox, swept by lowly Baltimore in their opening series over the weekend, beat the defending AL champion Rays in three straight by a combined 26-9.	Coming into the series, the Rays had won eight straight at Fenway Park and 13 of 14.	“On Sunday, going home it was a tough one," said Red Sox manager Alex Cora, whose team now heads to Baltimore. “Hopping on this plane, it’s going to be a different feeling. But nothing changes. We need to work to get better.”	Ryan Yarbrough (0-1), who pitched 5 2/3 shutout innings in his first outing this season, added three more scoreless before Bogaerts singled in a run and scored on Vázquez’s line drive over the Green Monster in the fourth. Vázquez also homered on Tuesday night to tie it in the ninth inning before Boston won it in the 12th; he caught the entire game.	“He needed a break, but obviously he’s really good against lefties,” Cora said. “He’s one of the toughest ones in that clubhouse. He wants to play every day. That catching position is a tough one; He nails it.”	Boston added six in the fifth -- all with two outs -- thanks to sloppy Tampa fielding.	Martinez doubled with runners on first and second to score two runs -- his major league-leading sixth double this season. Bogaerts singled on a hard-hit ball that shortstop Willy Adames couldn’t handle, then Vázquez followed with an RBI single.	Hunter Renfroe then hit a grounder to shortstop and Adames threw it wide of first base. As the ball rolled around in the netting above the photo pit next to the dugout, both Bogaerts and Vázquez scored.	Christian Arroyo followed with a double to make it 9-1 and send the Rays to their fourth straight loss. In all, Yarbrough was charged with a career-high nine runs — six of them earned — and nine hits in five innings.	Martinez, who homered in the 2020 finale, is the first Red Sox payer with at least one extra-base hit in each of the team’s first six games since David Ortiz started the 2005 season with six straight. Martinez also has had two or more RBI in each of the last four games.	Boston had double-digit hits for the third straight game.	“I feel like we have one of the best offenses in baseball,” said Eovaldi, who has allowed one or zero runs in each of his last six starts dating to Aug. 20. “Other teams are sleeping on us right now, which is fine. I feel like we’re going to be able to go out there and compete.”	TRAINERS ROOM	Red Sox: LHP Eduardo Rodríguez (left elbow inflammation) will come off the IL and start the series opener in Baltimore on Thursday. Tanner Houck, who started Saturday’s game against the Orioles and allowed three runs in five innings, was optioned to the team’s alternate training site in Worcester.	UP NEXT	Rays: LHP Rich Hill pitches in the series opener against the New York Yankees.	Red Sox: Rodríguez makes his delayed debut when the Red Sox open their series at Baltimore.	------

ARLINGTON, Texas -- — Kyle Gibson rebounded from a horrendous opening day start for Texas by striking out eight over six scoreless innings, and the Rangers beat the Toronto Blue Jays 2-1 in the rubber game of their three-game series Wednesday.	Gibson (1-0) scattered six hits with one walk while throwing 55 of 82 pitches for strikes.	“It was just nice for Gibby to get back out there and do what we expected with all of the work this guy has put in,” manager Chris Woodward said. “He looked like the No. 1 today ... He kind of set the tone.”	Six days earlier, in the first opening-day start for Gibson in his nine big league seasons, the Rangers led 5-0 at Kansas City before he had thrown his first pitch. But Gibson recorded only one out while facing eight batters and giving up five runs. It was the shortest opening day start in franchise history, the shortest in the majors since 1982 and the only time he failed he to get out of the first inning.	Nick Solak homered  off left-hander Hyun Jin Ryu (0-1), who struck out seven without a walk over seven innings.	“He’s impressive, to see somebody pitch like that all of the time,” Toronto manager Charlie Montoyo said. “He’s our ace, and he gave us a chance.”	Marcus Semien hit his third homer for the Blue Jays, a leadoff shot in the eighth.	Ian Kennedy, the third Texas reliever, struck out three around a hit in the ninth for his second save, both in less than 24 hours. The 36-year-old right-hander went to spring training on a minor league deal with Texas, which then lost potential closers Jose Leclerc and Jonathan Hernandez to injuries.	Gibson got an out against the Blue Jays on Semien's flyball to left on the first pitch, and had five strikeouts the first time through the order. Toronto had the bases loaded with one out in the fifth after Semien walked before Cavan Biggio grounded into a double play.	“I don’t know that I really needed to do too much work in between the ears honestly,” Gibson said about his thoughts since the opener. "As I looked back on it ... I ended up creating some of the damage that they did just by not having good command.”	Woodward said he would chalk up the first game to “opening day weirdness," then added, "This is what we were expecting.”	Solak led off the Rangers second with his first home run this season. Catcher Jose Trevino reached on an infield single later in the inning and scored when Leody Taveras blooped a broken-bat single to short right.	Ryu has allowed only two runs in each of his two starts, with 12 strikeouts and only one walk, but the South Korean pitcher has gotten only three runs of support.	“Overall, it was a good outing,” Ryu said through a translator. “I was able to make sure the hitters got soft contact, and that allowed me to throw seven innings.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Blue Jays: CF George Springer, who had hoped to make Blue Jays debut on Thursday, felt tightness in his right quad running bases. Springer started the season on the injured list with a strained left oblique muscle that gave him no issues during batting practice Tuesday before running the bases. ... C Danny Jansen was back in the lineup. He left the series opener Monday after taking a foul top off the inside of his right knee.	Rangers: 3B Brock Holt came out of Tuesday night's game late with right hamstring tightness, but already wasn't scheduled to start Wednesday against a left-handed pitcher.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays: Become the first team in MLB history to play home openers in three different cities over three consecutive seasons. They host the Los Angeles Angels at their spring training home in Dunedin, Florida, after playing home games in Buffalo last season. Their last game in their home park in Toronto was before the pandemic in 2019.	Rangers: After a day off for the team Thursday, Japanese RHP Kohei Arihara (0-0, 5.40 ERA) makes his first home start for Texas in a series opener against the San Diego Padres on Friday night.	------

CHICAGO -- — Lorenzo Cain hit his second homer of the game, a three-run shot in the 10th inning and the Milwaukee Brewers beat the Chicago Cubs 4-2 on Wednesday.	Brewers starter Brandon Woodruff had a no-hit bid going until Ian Happ led off the seventh with a clean single. It was scoreless until then — after that, the ball began to fly.	Cain, who had missed three games with an oblique strain, hit a solo homer leading off the eighth. Joc Pederson tied it with his first home run — and first hit — for the Cubs, a drive in the bottom half off reliever Devin Williams.	After automatic runner Daniel Robertson moved to third on a single by pinch-hitter Daniel Vogelbach in the 10th, Cain drove a 1-1 pitch from Brandon Workman (0-1) to the center-field batter’s eye on a warm afternoon at Wrigley Field.	“You're always happy to pull out a win, especially the way Woody pitched,” said Cain, who had his sixth career multihomer game and first since June 2017. “I'm still not where I want to be as far as my timing. I'm still trying to get back to my old form, but today was a good day.”	Cain, a two-time All-Star who turns 35 next week, played five games last season before opting out Aug. 1 because of coronavirus concerns.	Jason Heyward singled in automatic runner Kris Bryant in the Cubs 10th off J.P Feyereisen. After two walks loaded the bases, Brad Boxberger came on to retire Happ on a fly to short left for the final out and his first save.	Woodruff permitted just one hit, struck out eight and walked none in seven innings.	“He was just locked in with everything,” manager Craig Counsell said.	Woodruff was consistently ahead on counts and threw just 74 pitches. Still, he said he was starting to run out of steam when Counsell replaced him with Williams to start the eighth.	“I think that was the right move,” Woodruff said. "I was starting to lose myself in the delivery a little there.	“In the future, if I can get through seven (innings) on 74 pitches, they'll have to pretty much rip me off the mound," he said.	Josh Hader (2-0) pitched a scoreless ninth for the win.	Christian Yelich had three hits, including a double, and walked for Milwaukee.	The Cubs finished with only three hits after getting just one in a 4-0 loss to the Brewers on Tuesday night.	Pederson was happy to get one of the them and have it be big. He's now 1 for 17 after signing a one-year deal with Chicago.	“It was a big relief just to get on the board, and at a time to tie the game up and give ourselves a chance to win," Pederson said.	Cubs starter Kyle Hendricks nearly matched Woodruff through six scoreless innings. The Cubs ace allowed four hits, while walking none and fanning six.	Hendricks rebounded from a shaky opening-day start when he allowed three runs in three innings.	'It felt a lot better to be honest with you, kind of from the start, from the first pitch," he said. “Definitely on the right track.”	NOT QUITE NO-NOS	The Brewers became the first team with two no-hit bids of six-plus innings in the first six games of a season since the 1990 Padres. RHP Corbin Burnes didn’t allow a hit through the first six innings against Minnesota on Saturday, a game the Twins won 2-0 .	TRAINER’S ROOM	Brewers: 2B Kolten Wong was held out of the starting lineup with an oblique strain, but entered in the eighth as a defensive replacement. Robertson started at second in Wong’s place, then moved to third in the eighth.	Cubs: C Willson Contreras got a scheduled maintenance day off and Tony Wolters started behind the plate. Contreras pinch-hit and walked in the 10th. Contreras was hit by a pitch in the helmet on Monday and in the upper body in the ninth inning on Tuesday, but manager David Ross said the plunkings had nothing to do with resting the catcher.	UP NEXT	Brewers: RHP Corbin Burnes (0-1, 1.42) takes the mound against St. Louis RHP Adam Wainwright (0-1, 20.25) in the Cardinals' home opener on Thursday afternoon.	Cubs: Jake Arrieta (1-0, 1.50) comes off a strong first start in his return to the Chicago to face the Pittsburgh’s Tyler Anderson (0-1, 5.40) on Thursday in the Pirates' home opener.	------

OAKLAND, Calif. -- — After six straight games to start the season when almost nothing went right, Mitch Moreland made sure the Oakland Athletics would have something to feel good about when they head out on the road.	Moreland hit an RBI single with one out in the 10th inning and the A's rallied to beat the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers 4-3 Wednesday for their first win of the season.	“Obviously we’ve been needing that one, kind of waiting for it,” Moreland said. “Hard-fought game today. We’ll take that and carry the momentum over into the road trip. It was a good one to get.”	The A’s were in danger of falling to 0-7 for the first time in franchise history before tying it in the ninth off Kenley Jansen when Matt Chapman scored on Elvis Andrus’ sacrifice fly. Chapman also hit a solo homer  earlier in the game.	Oakland then won it in the 10th when Moreland’s line-drive single to center off Jimmy Nelson (0-1) scored Mark Canha from third. Canha started the inning on second base and had advanced on a flyout.	That helped the A's avoid the first 0-7 homestand in franchise history.	“It’s definitely not the start we wanted,” Moreland said. “We know we’re a lot better team than that. We played great in spring and kind of had a little bit of lag. It didn’t go our way out of the gate. That’s a good win for us.”	Yusmerio Petit (1-0) pitched a scoreless 10th for the win.	Trevor Bauer put together his second straight strong performance after signing with the Dodgers this offseason for $102 million over three years. The 2020 NL Cy Young winner allowed three hits and two runs in 6 2/3 innings, recording 10 strikeouts for the second straight start.	But he ended up with a no-decision when Jansen couldn’t hold the lead in the ninth.	“That’s just uncharacteristic not having command like that," manager Dave Roberts said. "I think that obviously the commanding of the baseball when you know that he’s right he does that.”	That provided a bad ending to a 5-2 road trip to open the season. The Dodgers now get ready for their home opener on Friday when they will receive their World Series rings after winning it all for the first time since 1988.	MANUFACTURED RUNS	The A's scored a run to tie the game in the fourth without benefit of a hit. Ramon Laureano was hit by a pitch, stole second and third and then scored on a wild pitch by Bauer.	The Dodgers answered with a run in the sixth Zach McKinstry bunted away from the shift toward third base with runners on second and third and two outs. Max Muncy raced home to score before Chapman tagged Austin Barnes out as he slid past third base.	HEAVY LOAD	A's starter Jesús Luzardo needed 35 pitches to navigate threw the first inning. He walked the first two batters and struck out the next two before allowing an RBI single to A.J. Pollock. A third walk to Max Muncy loaded the bases before Luzardo escaped with no further damage by getting Austin Barnes to fly out with the bases loaded.	Luzardo lasted 5 1/3 innings, giving up two runs and five hits, getting some help when Seth Brown robbed Barnes of a homer to left field in the fourth inning.	“After the first I said ‘I’m done getting embarrassed' and a switch flipped in my head,” Luzardo said.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Dodgers: RF Mookie Betts got the day off because of a stiff lower back but is expected to play Friday. ... CF Cody Bellinger missed a second straight game with a sore calf.	Athletics: Manager Bob Melvin said closer Trevor Rosenthal is “contemplating surgery” for his shoulder injury. Rosenthal is considering a procedure that typically has a three-month recovery time. ... 1B Matt Olson missed a second straight game with a bruised left knee but could return Thursday.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: After a day off, the Dodgers will take on Washington in the home opener Friday when they will receive their World Series rings. Walker Buehler (0-0) gets the start for Los Angeles.	Athletics: Cole Irvin (0-1) gets his second start when Oakland heads to Houston to take on the Astros. The A's were outscored 35-9 while getting swept in a season-opening four-game series against Houston.	------

WASHINGTON -- — Yes, Pablo Sandoval is 34 and in his 14th year in the majors, a two-time All-Star and a World Series MVP. He still needed to prove himself in spring training to earn a roster spot with the Atlanta Braves and a $1 million, one-year deal.	He's sure paying dividends quickly.	The guy affectionately known as Kung Fu Panda hit his second pinch-hit homer in a week Wednesday, driving a two-run shot to the deepest part of the ballpark off a Washington reliever who took over after Stephen Strasburg's six scoreless innings and lifting the Braves to a 2-0 victory over the Nationals for a doubleheader sweep.	“I don’t want to lie,” said Sandoval, who hit three homers in one game for the San Francisco Giants in the 2012 Fall Classic. “It’s one of those moments when you get goose bumps.”	Atlanta entered the day 0-4 but got headed in the right direction during the opener, when Ronald Acuña Jr. led the way with a double and a pair of singles to help the Braves win 7-6.	Sandoval signed a minor league contract in January with the Braves, then earned a job, which sure looks like a wise choice by the club.	“No situation’s going to be too big,” manager Brian Snitker said. “Not only in that role, but in the clubhouse, too. This guy is awesome to have on your team.”	Sandoval came off the bench to homer on opening day, then did the same Wednesday. He turned on a 96 mph fastball from Tanner Rainey (0-1) with a 3-2 count, sending it more than 400 feet following Dansby Swanson's two-out single in the seventh and final inning.	“I missed my spot,” Rainey said, “and he didn’t miss his swing.”	The righty hadn't faced hitters since the exhibition finale in Florida nine days earlier. A coronavirus outbreak that hit the Nationals kept them from working out or playing for nearly a full week.	Luke Jackson (1-0) earned the win in Game 2 by pitching around a pair of walks in the sixth.	Sean Newcomb got three strikeouts for the save.	“That’s closer stuff, right there,” Snitker said.	Strasburg hadn't pitched in a regular-season game since being shut down last August and having carpal tunnel surgery on his right wrist.	Reaching 95 mph with his fastball, Strasburg struck out eight and walked two while exceeding his total inning output for 2020, which was just five.	The 2019 World Series MVP made only two appearances last year. The 32-year-old right-hander’s preparation this spring was slowed by a left calf issue, but he showed zero signs of being anything but at his best Wednesday, retiring his last 10 batters.	“That was awesome to see,” manager Dave Martinez said. “Man, he looked great.”	The only hit Strasburg allowed was a single to the game’s second batter, Ozzie Albies. The only real trouble came in the third, when Strasburg walked Acuña and Albies, bringing Freddie Freeman to the plate. But Strasburg retired the reigning NL MVP on a fly to center.	“My execution was not very good most of spring training," Strasburg said. “I thought my execution was a lot better today and it’s a step in the right direction.”	Strasburg, who doubled in his first at-bat, was lifted for a pinch-hitter in the sixth after 85 pitches.	Huascar Ynoa went five scoreless innings for Atlanta, allowing two hits.	In Game 1, the Braves put up five runs in the second inning off Erick Fedde (0-1), then held on with a save by Will Smith a day after he gave up a walk-off hit to Juan Soto.	Smith, Atlanta’s fifth pitcher, didn't have an easy time of things, though.	Trying to protect a 7-5 lead Wednesday, the first batter he faced was Soto. This time, Soto walked, and Starlin Castro drove him in with a double. Then, with two men on, Smith got Andrew Stevenson to ground into a double play.	“This was kind of an agonizing week,” Snitker said after Atlanta avoided what would have been its first 0-5 start since 2016. “A good day to end the road trip.”	STRASBURG'S SESSION	Strasburg said he managed to get in a throwing session with a bullpen catcher while the Nationals were idle by crawling through some bushes and hopping a fence to get into a Little League field in Virginia.	“I didn’t want to do that again,” he said.	HUMDRUM	Even though 4,927 spectators were present — unlike last season, when all fans were banned —- there still was fake crowd noise piped in, offering an odd, and annoying, hum of a soundtrack.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Braves: RHP Mike Soroka, sidelined since August after tearing his Achilles tendon, will be shut down for two weeks because of inflammation in his right shoulder. He threw an inning during a simulated game Tuesday and does not have any structural damage, Snitker said. ... Game 1 pitcher Max Fried was hit by a batted ball but neither he nor Snitker sounded too worried about the lefty's leg. “Nothing too serious," the pitcher said.	Nationals: Missing nine players because of their COVID-19 outbreak — four who tested positive, five who were quarantined because of potential exposure. Those under quarantine possibly could rejoin the club on its upcoming six-game trip, Martinez said.	UP NEXT	Braves: Home opener is Friday against the Phillies, with Charlie Morton starting for Atlanta against Zack Wheeler.	Nationals: Planned to fly to California on Wednesday night; they open a three-game set at the Dodgers on Friday. “It’s been a long week,” Martinez said. "It’s been a long week for all of us.”	------

PHILADELPHIA -- — Alec Bohm and J.T. Realmuto each hit a three-run homer, Rhys Hoskins had a solo shot and the Philadelphia Phillies beat the New York Mets 8-2 on Wednesday.	The Phillies took two of three from their division rivals after opening the season with a three-game sweep of three-time defending NL East champion Atlanta.	Phillies ace Aaron Nola lasted only four innings, pitching out of trouble the final two. He allowed one run and six hits, striking out five.	“He had to grind through,” Phillies manager Joe Girardi said. "His location and stuff wasn’t sharp but he found a way to get through four innings against a good lineup giving up only one run. That’s the mark of a good pitcher.”	Connor Brogdon (3-0) got five outs to earn his third win in six games. Three relievers pitched the final 3 1/3 innings.	New York starter David Peterson (0-1) surrendered six runs and seven hits in four innings.	The Mets had their season-opening series at Washington wiped out because of a coronavirus outbreak among the Nationals.	“I don't think that really hurt us,” Mets manager Luis Rojas said of the layoff. “I thought that we prepared well to come into this series and compete. ... We could’ve won this series. There’s no excuse. We go home 1-2.”	Hoskins launched an opposite-field drive just over the right-field wall in the first. Bryce Harper lined the next pitch off the fence for a double. After Realmuto walked, Bohm blasted a fastball deep into the left-center field seats for a 4-0 lead.	Pete Alonso’s RBI single in the third cut it to 4-1 but Nola escaped further damage by striking out Dominic Smith and Jonathan Villar to leave runners on first and third.	Nola got out of another jam in the fourth, freezing Michael Conforto with a backdoor curve to leave the bases loaded. Before Conforto came up, Francisco Lindor took an 0-2 curve off his foot after ripping a liner down the right-field line that just hooked foul.	Realmuto connected on the first pitch thrown by reliever Jacob Barnes in the fifth, sending an opposite-field shot out to right to make it 7-1.	The Phillies hit two homers in the first five games before going deep three times against the Mets.	“I think the biggest thing is putting traffic on base and if you do that you’re going to score runs,” Girardi said. “Home runs do it quickly but on base is important for me.”	Lindor, the four-time All-Star shortstop acquired from Cleveland in the offseason and signed to a team-record, $341 million, 10-year contract extension last week, was 2 for 11 with one RBI in his first series with the Mets.	He was taunted by Philly fans with chants of “overrated” in his last at-bat.	STRANDED	The Mets were 1 for 12 with runners in scoring position and left 14 men on base.	STRONG PITCHING	Philadelphia’s starters have a 2.18 ERA in the first six games. The bullpen is at 3.27.	SLUG IT	Hoskins hit two doubles along with his homer and became the fourth Phillies player with seven extra-base hits in the first six games. He joined Ryan Howard (2010), John Kruk (1993), and Del Ennis (1950).	TRAINER’S ROOM	Mets: 3B J.D. Davis wasn’t in the lineup because of swelling in his bruised left hand. A 91 mph fastball hit his hand Tuesday night. A second set of X-rays were negative. He remains day to day.	UP NEXT	Mets: RHP Taijuan Walker starts the home opener Thursday against Miami. Walker spent last season with Seattle and Toronto, going 4-3 with a 2.70 ERA.	Phillies: RHP Zack Wheeler (1-0, 0.00 ERA) starts the opener of a three-game series at Atlanta.	------

SEATTLE -- — Kyle Seager became the beneficiary of Ty France's ability to be a pest at the plate.	Seager slapped an opposite-field, bases-clearing double for the big blow in Seattle’s seven-run sixth inning, and the Mariners avoided a sweep with an 8-4 win over the Chicago White Sox on Wednesday.	Seager had three hits, and his two-out liner down the left-field line cleared the bases as the Mariners posted their highest-scoring inning of the young season. But Seager got his chance at hitting in the inning because France refused to relent.	“That was an incredible at-bat. He worked him like crazy,” Seager said.	France fell behind 0-2, fouled off four two-strike pitches and walked on the 11th pitch of the at-bat from Chicago's Matt Foster to keep the inning alive for Seager.	“It’s pretty awesome to watch. He did not back down. He was not going to give in," Seattle manager Scott Servais said. "He kept fighting, fighting, fighting and ended up with the walk, and kind of opened the flood gates after that.”	Taylor Trammell, J.P. Crawford and Jose Marmolejos all had RBI singles in the inning, and Mitch Haniger added a sacrifice fly.	Almost all of that damage came off Foster who took over after Dallas Keuchel allowed the first two batters of the inning to reach. Foster (0-1) recorded just two outs, and allowed five hits and five earned runs before getting lifted.	Chicago manager Tony La Russa said he mismanaged the inning and left Foster in for too long.	“That’s probably the clearest example why I’m upset with myself, (Foster) faced too many hitters,” La Russa said.	Keuchel allowed three runs, struck out three and walked three in his second start of the season.	Seattle starter Justin Dunn allowed only one hit, but couldn’t finish the fifth inning due to control problems. Dunn walked eight in 4 2/3 innings, including a bases loaded walk to Yasmani Grandal that ended his day. Andrew Vaughn greeted Will Vest (1-0) with a two-run single, and Danny Mendick added an RBI single an inning later.	But that was all the White Sox could manage. Chicago failed to score after loading the bases with no outs in the seventh as Luis Robert lined into a double play that ended the threat.	“We were in a really good position going into the sixth inning and the best way to explain the sixth, I mean I did a really lousy job of managing that inning,” La Russa said.	WALK THIS WAY	Dunn’s eight walks were the most by a Seattle starting pitcher since Travis Blackley walked nine vs. Oakland in July 2004. The franchise record by a starter is 11 by Rick Jones in Seattle’s expansion season of 1977. Hall of Famer Randy Johnson walked 10 twice during his time with the Mariners.	Seattle pitchers walked 10 batters total. Dunn said he felt comfortable throwing out of the wind-up but had issues pitching out of the stretch.	“Probably put a little too much emphasis on controlling the running game and not executing pitches and to started to get a little too fine,” Dunn said.	TRAINER’S ROOM	White Sox: LF Billy Hamilton was replaced in the fifth inning due to tightness in his left hamstring after stealing third base. ... Chicago placed SS Tim Anderson on the 10-day injured list but are hopeful he’ll be able to return from his hamstring injury early next week. Manager Tony La Russa held out hope Anderson would be available for Thursday’s home opener but the team decided to be safe and hold him out longer. Anderson will be eligible to come off the injured list April 15.	Mariners: 1B Evan White was lifted in the fifth inning due to tightness in his left quadriceps and is unlikely to play on Thursday against Minnesota. White appeared to be bothered by the leg while running out a ground ball in the bottom of the third inning that led to Seattle’s first run. White was replaced by Marmolejos. The Mariners are likely to re-evaluate whether White needs to go on the injured list after Thursday's game.	UP NEXT	White Sox: RHP Lance Lynn (0-0) will make his second start as the White Sox return home to face the Royals. Lynn allowed two unearned runs in 4 2/3 innings in his first start against the Angels.	Mariners: LHP Marco Gonzales (0-0) looks to rebound after a shaky first outing on opening day as Seattle goes on the road for the first time beginning in Minnesota. Gonzales gave up five earned runs in six innings against San Francisco.	------

SAN DIEGO -- — Alex Dickerson scored on Donovan Solano's sacrifice fly in the top of the 10th inning and the San Francisco Giants beat the San Diego Padres 3-2 Wednesday behind an odd home run by Darin Ruf and seven strong innings from Gausman.	Dickerson, who grew up in suburban Poway, started the 10th on second base and advanced when Mike Yastrzemski beat out a nubber down the first base line for an infield single. Reliever Tim Hill (0-1) let the ball roll, thinking it would go foul. Solano followed with a flyball to right to bring in Dickerson.	San Diego's Jurickson Profar reached third in the 10th on Kim Ha-seong's grounder before Wandy Peralta struck out Jorge Mateo and got rookie Tucupita Marcano to fly out to end it for his first career save. Jake McGee (1-0) pitched a perfect ninth for the win.	San Diego's Wil Myers tied the game at 2 with a homer in the eighth off Tyler Rogers.	The Giants had led since the second inning, when Ruf's flyball with one out off Blake Snell went off Mateo's glove and over the center-field fence for a two-run homer. Mateo tried to make a leaping catch against the fence but the ball bounced off the heel of his glove and went over for Ruf’s second homer of the series. Evan Longoria was aboard on a leadoff double.	“It looked like it hit off the bottom of his glove," Ruf said. "When you play outfield and are kind of in between jumping toward the wall of jumping off of two feet, it looks like he kind of got caught in between. It’s a tough play and luckily it went our way.”	Ruf homered on an 0-1 fastball. “After the first fastball my eyes were kind of looking for that and luckily he threw it again, kind of middle in, middle up and I was able to pull my hands inside and get my barrel to it.," he said.	Gausman was brilliant for a second straight start but once again didn't factor in the decision. He held the Padres to one run and four hits in seven innings, struck out five and walked one.	The Padres didn't get to Gausman until the fifth inning, when Mateo hit an RBI single. San Diego had runners on first and second with two outs in the sixth before Gausman struck out rookie Luis Campusano.	“You know the runs are going to be at a premium," Gausman said. "I thought we both threw the ball pretty well today. It’s always fun going up against a guy that has incredible stuff. Anytime you face a guy who’s won a Cy Young, you want to beat him, obviously, and you definitely kind of elevate your game a little more.”	Gausman was coming off an excellent start at Seattle on opening day, when he allowed only one run while pitching into the seventh. He didn't factor into the decision after the Mariners rallied in the 10th for an 8-7 win.	Snell allowed two runs and two hits in five innings, struck out eight and walked four.	Snell, obtained in a trade with Tampa Bay on Dec. 29, also got his first big league hit, a single off Gausman in the third.

MIAMI -- —	Yadier Molina hit a two-run homer and Dylan Carlson added a grand slam, leading the St. Louis Cardinals over Miami 7-0 Wednesday for a three-game sweep that dropped the Marlins to 1-5 for the first time since 2015.	Jack Flaherty (1-0) allowed one hit in six innings, a leadoff single by Corey Dickerson, who advanced on a walk before he was caught stealing. After another walk, Flaherty settled down. He allowed only two more runners, both on walks, and struck out six.	Flaherty had given up six runs over 4 1/3 innings at Cincinnati on opening day.	“Early on I wasn’t locating my fastball,” Flaherty said. “The last game was the same thing. As the innings went on, I was able to attack more, establish my fastball and pitch off of that. I got to a lot better counts.”	Genesis Cabrera and Jordan Hicks finished the three-hitter.	St. Louis allowed three runs against the Marlins after giving up 27 in the opening series.	Pablo López (0-1) allowed two runs and three hits in 6 2/3 innings.	St. Louis had advanced just one runner to scoring position before the seventh.	Molina homered for a 2-0 lead in the seventh and drove in the go-ahead run in each game of the series. Matt Carpenter had drawn a out-two walk, ending a string of 10 batters retired by López.	“Yadi got the big blow and the guys continued to fight,” Cardinals manager Mike Shildt said. “López was good. They threw some good pitching at us.”	Carlson connected against Zach Pop in the ninth, homering for the second consecutive game. He has three hits this season, and all are home runs.	“We put together some good at bats in that inning,” Carlson said. “I worked that back from an 0-2 count. I was really proud of that.”	Miami went 1-for-22 with runners in scoring position in the series. Cardinals right fielder Justin Williams made the game’s final out with a diving catch off Jon Berti’s sinking line drive with Jesús Aguilar on second.	“It definitely didn’t go the way we wanted, disappointing to start the season like this,” Miami manager Don Mattingly said. “I thought we’d be a little more consistent and that’s the part that kind of surprises me.”	Paul Goldschmidt also had an RBI single for St. Louis.	Nolan Arenado singled in the fourth and has hit safely in his first six games as a Cardinal.	STILL IN THE LINEUP:	The 38-year-old Molina caught the first six games, including Wednesday’s 4:10 p.m. start.	“If this were a 1 o’clock game, we would have given it consideration,” Shildt said of resting Molina. “We are going to be intentional giving him some blows. The guy is in a real good place. He loves to play.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Cardinals: (LHP) Kwang Hyun Kim (back stiffness) is expected to return with the team to St. Louis for the club’s first homestand but there is no announced timetable to activate him from the injured list. Kwang pitched against minor leaguers Tuesday at the team’s spring training facility in Jupiter, Florida.	UP NEXT	Cardinals: RHP Adam Wainwright (0-1, 20.25) will start the home opener against Milwaukee on Thursday. Wainwright allowed six runs and seven hits and was pulled after 2 2/3 innings at Cincinnati.	Marlins: RHP Nick Neidert (0-0) or RHP Paul Campbell (0-0) is to start the Mets home opener on Thursday.

NEW YORK -- — Anthony Santander delivered a dart from right field, a game-saver to home plate for the Orioles.	He might not have had the chance if Yankees shortstop Gleyber Torres had gotten a routine throw across the diamond an inning earlier.	Santander threw out Gio Urshela trying to score on a fly ball in the 11th, moments after pinch-hitter Chance Sisco's go-ahead single in the top half, and Baltimore beat the New York Yankees 4-3 Wednesday night.	Brett Gardner bunted Urshela, the automatic runner, to third to open the inning. DJ LeMahieu then ripped a liner to right. Santander set himself, caught it and delivered a perfect throw home, a couple steps ahead of Urshela, who slid face first into catcher Pedro Severino's tag.	“Well, he hit the ball to the right guy,” O's manager Brandon Hyde said.	It was the second laser home from Santander in the game, but he came up just short trying to get Tyler Wade in the 10th. Santander also homered in the fifth.	Baltimore did not make Santander available to reporters after the game.	Wade's run might have been the winner if not for Torres' blunder in the top of the 10th. The 24-year-old skipped a throw past first baseman Jay Bruce on a two-out grounder by the slow-footed Severino, allowing Santander to score from third.	Torres has two errors this season after tying for the AL lead among shortstops with nine last year. He took over the position in 2020 after Didi Gregorius became a free agent.	“I think the important thing is to continue to reinforce a lot of the good things, a lot of the progress that he legitimately has made,” manager Aaron Boone said, adding “he has all the capabilities to be able to go out there and do it.	"You have a high-profile miscue or something, you have to be able to work past that.”	Sisco’s one-out hit off Chad Green (0-1) scored Rio Ruiz from third following a sacrifice bunt by Freddy Galvis. It was Baltimore’s first hit since the fifth inning and its fourth total — New York had 13, but only three with runners in scoring position.	César Valdez (1-0), working primarily with a 76 mph changeup, pitched 2 1/3 innings and got Baltimore through the 10th. Paul Fry got his first save, ending a 3-hour, 54-minute night.	The Orioles dropped the series’ first two games after winning three straight in Boston to open the season. This win ended a franchise-record 12-game skid at Yankee Stadium and improved the club to 4-25 in its past 29 against New York.	“I felt fortunate,” Hyde said. “You get four hits through 11 innings against the New York Yankees, you're not usually going to win. Credit goes to our guys for battling.”	Prior to Sisco's hit, New York relievers pitched six perfect innings — except for Torres' error — following a sharp pinstripe debut for Jameson Taillon, who started for the first time in 707 days.	In the bottom of the 10th, Kyle Higashioka scored pinch-runner Wade from second with a sharp single to right — Wade slickly slid around Severino, touching his left hand on the plate as he went by.	Cedric Mullins and Santander homered for Baltimore in the fifth, accounting for two of its three hits prior to the 11th. Baltimore struck out 17 times, brining its total to 44 for the series.	Urshela rallied New York with a tying double in the eighth inning, scoring pinch-runner Mike Tauchman from first. Urshela appeared shaken up after sliding into Severino in the 11th, but Boone said he was OK.	Yankees slugger Aaron Judge was held out of New York’s lineup with soreness in his left side a night after he had a homer, three hits and four RBI against Baltimore. The Yankees are off on Thursday, giving the right fielder two days to rest.	Mullins has hit safely in each of Baltimore’s first six games, going 12 for 25.	Baltimore left-hander John Means surrendered a run over 4 2/3 innings, his sixth straight start allowing one-or-fewer runs. That matched Hall of Famer Jim Palmer for the longest such streak with Baltimore. Means gave up seven hits and two walks and struck out four.	TAILLON'S RETURN	Taillon struck out seven, allowing three hits and no walks — he only faced a trio three-ball counts out of 17 batters.	The right-hander hadn’t pitched since May 1, 2019 — then with Pittsburgh — due to a second Tommy John surgery. Momentous comebacks are hardly new for the 29-year-old. His career was also slowed by a hernia operation in 2015 and surgery to treat testicular cancer in 2017. Additionally, he was hit in the head by a line drive in April 2019, although he remained in the game.	“It's going to sound cheesy, but I’ll never take a day in a big league uniform for granted, that’s for sure,” Taillon said.	BIG SHOTS	Yankees players, coaches, field and support staff were vaccinated at the stadium Wednesday. The team didn't disclose how many players were inoculated, but manager Aaron Boone said before the game he anticipated the team easily clearing the 85% threshold mandated by Major League Baseball for teams to begin easing certain health and safety protocols.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: Hyde said OF DJ Stewart (left hamstring strain) is making progress but doesn't have a projected return date yet.	Yankees: Boone wasn't certain that Judge would return to the lineup Friday at Tampa Bay. ... 2B Rougned Odor wasn’t in uniform Wednesday, a day after being acquired from the Texas Rangers. ... LHP Justin Wilson (shoulder soreness) is expected to be activated when he’s eligible on Friday. Until then, New York will carry only 25 players.	UP NEXT	Orioles: RHP Matt Harvey (0-0, 3.86) gets the ball in Baltimore's home opener against Boston. The Red Sox will start LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (19-6, 3.81 in 2019), pitching for the first time since missing last season with a COVID-19-related heart condition.	Yankees: Hope to get Judge back Friday at Tampa Bay. RHP Corey Kluber (0-0, 2.25) makes his second start for New York, facing Rays veteran LHP Rich Hill (0-0, 9.00).	------	Follow Jake Seiner: https://twitter.com/Jake--Seiner	------

DENVER -- — Antonio Senzatela pitched eight electric innings on a cool evening, Chris Owings had three extra-base hits before leaving with right hamstring tightness, and the Colorado Rockies snapped a four-game skid by beating the Arizona Diamondbacks 8-0 on Wednesday night.	Senzatela (1-1) scattered four hits by mixing in a sizzling slider with a fastball that was moving all over. He walked two and struck out three. Senzatela was lifted for a pinch-hitter in the bottom of the eight after throwing 96 pitches.	The right-hander continues to flourish at Coors Field, improving his career mark to 22-10 at the notorious hitter's park.	“We had a good plan today,” Senzatela said. “We executed that plan.”	Owings had two doubles, a triple and drove in two runs as he increased his average to .500. He also made a sliding catch in right field in the fifth before being replaced by Sam Hilliard to start the sixth. Rockies manager Bud Black said Owings was taken out as a precaution.	“Overall, it was a clean game, well played by us,” Black said of the win. “We just kept on the attack both on the mound and at the plate. Good game for the Rockies.”	It was a second straight rough outing for Madison Bumgarner (0-1), who allowed five runs and eight hits over five innings. He’s now surrendered 11 runs over nine innings.	“He was OK in spurts,” Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said. “We know that he’s working hard. He’s got a process. He’s got a plan and he’s prepared. This game can be unrewarding at times."	The news only got worse for the Diamondbacks as Ketel Marte left the game in the sixth after grabbing at the back of his right hamstring while running to first base. Marte was helped off the field. Lovullo said Marte felt his leg cramping up and “was trying to put on the brakes and protect it as best he could.”	Lovullo added: “We’re not exactly sure the extent of what is happening there right now.”	Leadoff hitter Garrett Hampson had a big game for the Rockies with a career-best three stolen bases. He finished with two singles, two walks and three runs scored.	For that, he can thank his mother and her pregame text.	“She said, ‘Leadoff!! Be aggressive,'” Hampson recounted. “I took it to heart. When Mom tells me to do something, I’m going to listen. Just had that mindset going in."	TRAINER’S ROOM	Diamondbacks: OF Kole Calhoun (right knee) played Tuesday at the team's alternate training site and was scheduled to play again Wednesday. “We’re going to soften that landing for him a little bit and we're going to be mindful of what he’s going through,” Lovullo said.	Rockies: Black said OF Raimel Tapia being out of the starting lineup had nothing to do with his sore neck following a collision with the wall over the weekend. Tapia entered the game in the eighth as a pinch-hitter.	PREGAME MOVE	Arizona reliever Chris Devenski was placed on the restricted list before the game. Lovullo said after the game it was for personal issues but couldn't elaborate.	To take his place on the roster, the Diamondbacks selected right-hander Anthony Swarzak from the alternate site.	CARB LOADING	Rockies right-hander Jon Gray left his start over the weekend with full body cramps. He believes it was from eating too much protein that day and not enough carbs. He also didn’t eat his customary banana.	“Carb up and get my bananas in,” said Gray, who will start Thursday in the finale of the three-game series.	The Diamondbacks will go with righty Merrill Kelly (0-1, 6.75). He gave up three earned runs over four innings in his last start at San Diego.	------
