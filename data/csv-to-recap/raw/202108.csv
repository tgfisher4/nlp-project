CHICAGO -- — Freddy Peralta pitched effectively into the sixth inning, Avisail García smacked a go-ahead two-run homer and the Milwaukee Brewers beat the Chicago Cubs 4-2 on Tuesday in the first game of a doubleheader.	Willy Adames and Lorenzo Cain also went deep for the NL Central-leading Brewers, who are a major league-best 35-19 on the road.	Peralta (9-3) allowed two runs on five hits in 5 1/3 innings. The All-Star right-hander struck out eight and walked two on a sweltering afternoon.	“I thought Freddy pitched really well,” Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said. “The conditions were difficult. He probably ran out of gas in a spot he usually doesn't because of the heat.”	Devin Williams got the final three outs for his second save after loading the bases with one out in the seventh. Williams struck out Patrick Wisdom and Greg Deichmann to end it.	Frank Schwindel had an RBI double and Rafael Ortega added three hits for Chicago, which has dropped five straight.	Cubs rookie Justin Steele (2-1) allowed three runs on five hits in five innings during his first career start. The left-hander was 2-0 with a 2.03 ERA in 11 relief appearances for Chicago earlier in the season. Following a stint on the injured list with a right hamstring strain, the 26-year-old was sent to Triple-A Iowa to stretch out as a starter. He was recalled before the game.	“It felt good to be back at Wrigley,” Steele said. “I made a few mistakes and they took advantage. I think I did all right. It's something to build on.”	Chicago took a 1-0 lead in the third on a bases-loaded walk by Wisdom.	Milwaukee quickly answered with three runs in the fourth. Adames led off with his 21st homer. After Eduardo Escobar doubled, García stroked a 457-foot blast to center to make it 3-1. It was García's 20th homer, tying his career high from 2019.	“I'm thinking small,” he said. “I'm not trying to hit homers. I'm thinking the middle of the field and not trying to do too much.”	Cain added a two-out homer in the sixth off reliever Trevor Megill for a 4-1 lead. It was Cain's fourth homer of the season and first since May 3.	Wisdom led off the sixth with an infield single. Peralta pounced off the mound toward the third-base line to field the ball, but his throw sailed past first and out of play for an error to allow Wisdom to take second. One out later, Schwindel doubled off the glove of third baseman Luis Urías to score Wisdom.	Brad Boxberger then replaced Peralta and got pinch-hitter David Bote and Alcántara to fly out to end the inning.	ROSTER MOVES	The Brewers activated RHP Jake Cousins from the COVID-19 injured list before the doubleheader and designated RHP Sal Romano for assignment.	To make room for Steele on the roster, the Cubs optioned LHP Kyle Ryan to Triple-A Iowa.	UP NEXT	Brewers rookie LHP Aaron Ashby (0-0, 54.00 ERA) makes his second career start in the nightcap, facing Cubs RHP Alec Mills (5-4, 4.41). Ashby made his major league debut in a start against Chicago on June 30 in Milwaukee and was roughed up for seven runs (four earned) on four hits in two-thirds of an inning.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BALTIMORE -- — Derek Hill and Akil Baddoo took off after Anthony Santander's drive to left-center field. Each player reached for the ball — and then they collided, sending Baddoo's cap flying.	“It was a nasty collision. It was a ball hit probably in the perfect spot for both guys to be going full speed, and both with a chance to catch it,” Detroit manager A.J. Hinch said. “You don't see it a lot at this level. When you see them, they're nasty.”	That frightening moment in the eighth inning came on an otherwise successful night for the Tigers, who beat the Baltimore Orioles 9-4 on Tuesday. Willi Castro doubled, tripled and drove in three runs in a game delayed 1 hour, 54 minutes at the start due to rain.	Miguel Cabrera singled and walked, and remained two home runs shy of 500 with two games remaining on Detroit’s road trip. Casey Mize allowed three home runs and didn’t make it out of the fifth inning, but the Tigers held on after building a big early lead.	Hill did make the catch when he and Baddoo ran into each other on Santander's flyball. Both outfielders left the game, although they were able to walk off the field after a bit of a delay.	“Obviously not good," Santander said through a translator. “I'm an outfielder, and I can definitely relate to that. You really don't want to see something like that.”	Hinch said Baddoo was being checked for a concussion and a shoulder injury and might need a few days off. Hill was having his ribs checked.	“When I got out there, obviously a couple trainers out there with me, both guys were pretty beat up and in a lot of pain," Hinch said. "Very scary incident.”	The Orioles have lost six straight games, and they've allowed at least nine runs in all of them. The last team to allow nine runs in six consecutive games was the Kansas City Royals from Sept. 4-10, 2002.	Detroit's bullpen was solid. Kyle Funkhouser (6-1), José Cisnero, Michael Fulmer, Buck Farmer and Gregory Soto held Baltimore without a run after Mize went 4 1/3 innings.	“That was as much of a grind of a 9-4 win as you're going to find,” Hinch said.	Santander hit two solo homers for the Orioles, and DJ Stewart added a solo shot. Jeimer Candelario hit a two-run homer in the eighth for Detroit. Baltimore has allowed 24 eighth-inning runs in the last six games.	Keegan Akin (0-6) allowed six runs and seven hits in three innings. Castro opened the scoring for the Tigers in the second with an RBI double, then scored on Baddoo's triple.	After Santander's homer in the second, Jonathan Schoop answered with an RBI double and scored on Niko Goodrum's single. Castro's two-run triple made it 6-1 and capped Detroit's four-run third.	Santander and Stewart went deep in the fourth, and the following inning, Cedric Mullins doubled. He then scored when Mize threw wildly to first for an error on Ramón Urias' comebacker.	Mullins extended his hitting streak to 17 games.	PROMISING SIGNS	Marcos Diplán gave the Orioles some much-needed effectiveness in relief, throwing two perfect innings. He was called up from the minors last week and has not allowed a hit in his first two big league appearances.	“I just liked the way he’s come in and thrown strikes, and shown good stuff," manager Brandon Hyde said. "Attacked hitters and went right after them with a good firm fastball.”	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: Detroit reinstated Goodrum from the injured list and optioned INF Zack Short to Triple-A Toledo.	Orioles: LHP Bruce Zimmermann (left bicep tendinitis) pitched five hitless innings for Triple-A Norfolk. ... Hyde said C Pedro Severino (knee) is day to day.

PHILADELPHIA -- — Max Scherzer and Aaron Nola had a pitchers’ duel ruined by rain. The Phillies saw their winning streak spoiled by a soggy bullpen.	Corey Seager and Max Muncy homered as the Los Angeles Dodgers ended Philadelphia’s win string at eight, beating the Phillies 5-0 on Tuesday night.	Scherzer and Nola combined for 13 strikeouts over a combined 7 1/3 innings in a scoreless matchup before heavy rain delayed the game in the bottom of the fourth inning for 1 hour, 44 minutes.	“They both were dealing and kind of having their way with the lineups,” Dodgers second baseman Trea Turner said.	Neither star pitcher returned when the game resumed.	The gripping performances ended in a whimper and Phillies fans booed when reliever J.D. Hammer (1-1) headed to the bullpen to warm up at the end of the delay.	With the Phillies riding their longest winning streak in 10 years, the boos still rose when the bullpen failed to keep them in the game. Seager hit a solo shot off Hammer in the fifth inning for his fifth homer of the year. Will Smith had an RBI single off Matt Moore that sent Turner gliding across the plate for a 2-0 lead. AJ Pollock added a two-RBI single off Enyel De Los Santos to make it 4-0.	“It's just how I slide, I guess,” Turner said. “ I try not to hit the ground too hard because it doesn’t feel good. I try and be as soft as I can be on slides.”	Muncy added his 23rd homer of the year in the ninth. Alex Vesia (2-1) got the win in a game that finished shortly before 12:30 a.m.	The winning streak coming off Sunday's retired jersey ceremony for the late Roy Halladay -- which returned so many stars from their 2007-2011 postseason heyday -- created a buzz in Philly and a crowd 28,333 turned out Tuesday before rain sent most of them packing.	“You saw the passion of the fans and how excited they get,” manager Joe Girardi said hours before the delay. “It was a great weekend. With everything, the ceremonies that we had, the importance of the series, the way we played, those are the things you look forward to.”	Scherzer vs. Nola gave the game some juice.	Boy, did they deliver.	Nola fanned Turner to start the game, then Muncy and Smith. He relied on his breaking stuff and struck out the side again in the third and finished with seven strikeouts -- all swinging -- in four innings.	“He's a pretty funky guy,” Turner said. “I always thought he was a tough at-bat. When you don't get to see him often, he can make it tough on you.”	Scherzer, who was still in DC when he recently feuded with Girardi over sticky stuff, was just as sharp. He struck out surging MVP candidate Bryce Harper in the fourth for his sixth strikeout. Jean Segura singled and then the rain fell, in a hurry.	There was not a sprinkle in the sky one second and the floodgates opened the next, sending the teams scurrying off the field and the grounds crew going on it at an Allyson Felix pace with the tarp.	Minus the rain, this one had a postseason feel.	The Phillies’ winning streak was their longest since they won nine straight from July 29 -- Aug. 6, 2011. The Phillies led the majors with 185 runs scored since July 1 and have hit the most home runs in that span with 54, entering Tuesday.	Scherzer, who struck out six in 3 1/3 innings, and six relievers combined for 15 strikeouts in the shutout. Phillies pitchers also struck out 15.	“We still had some opportunities to come up with the big hit like we have been able to as of late," Girardi said. "It's very unfortunate that the rain came”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Dodgers: OF Mookie Betts was a late scratch with a sore right hip that could send him to the injured list. ... 3B Justin Turner also is expected to miss the Phillies’ series with left groin pain. “I don’t see him coming back any sooner than Friday in New York,” manager Dave Roberts said. ... RHP Joe Kelly (undisclosed) was placed on the injured list. RHP Corey Knebel (right lat strain) was activated.	Phillies: 1B Rhys Hoskins was placed on the 10-day IL with a left groin strain and they recalled OF Mickey Moniak from Triple-A Lehigh Valley. Hoskins leads the Phillies with 24 homers and 68 RBI and will be out through the rest of the homestand that ends Sunday. ... OF Andrew McCutchen (left knee) should be set to come off the injured list on Wednesday.	BRITO STRONG	The Phillies wore T-shirts that said “Brito Strong” in recognition of minor league infielder Daniel Brito, who collapsed during a game last week.	UP NEXT	The Phillies send RHP Kyle Gibson (8-3, 2.79 ERA) to the mound against LA LHP David Price (4-1, 3.53 ERA).	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PITTSBURGH -- — J.A. Happ combined with a trio of relievers on a one-hitter, Tommy Edman and Paul DeJong homered early and the St. Louis Cardinals beat the skidding Pittsburgh Pirates 4-1 on Tuesday night.	Happ (6-6) retired the first nine batters, then gave up rookie Hoy Park’s first career home run to lead off the fourth inning.	”I was able to get a couple of quick outs to manage the pitch count and (catcher Yadier Molina) was great back there and we were on the same page all night,” Happ said. “I was just trying to execute pitches and it turned out pretty well.”	Making his second start for the Cardinals since being acquired from the Twins in a July 30 trade, Happ struck out five and walked two.	“He’s under control with everything he’s doing,” St. Louis manager Mike Shidlt said of the 38-year-old Happ. “He’s got the pitches. His fastball has life to it. He’s in control and that allows him to be steady and win games.”	The left-hander took a no-hit bid into the eighth inning against the Pirates on April 23 at Minnesota and wound up allowing one hit in 7 2/3 innings.	“Both of his starts against us, he’s really executed balls to both sides (of the plate), especially the fastball,” Pittsburgh manager Derek Shelton said.	Relievers Ryan Helsley, Genesis Cabrera and Alex Reyes teamed for three hitless innings. Reyes pitched a perfect ninth for his 26th save in 27 chances.	“It was fun to see those guys come in and continue to close the door with the lead,” Happ said.	The Cardinals (56-56) reached .500 for the 22nd time this season. The Pirates’ losing streak was extended to six games and they have dropped 16 of 21.	Edman led off the game with a drive into the left-field bleachers off Steven Brault, the second leadoff homer of his career. DeJong’s solo shot in the second increased the Cardinals’ lead to 2-0.	The Cardinals entered the night 10 ½ games behind the first-place Milwaukee Brewers in the NL Central race and 8 ½ games out of the second wild card.	“We’re at the point of the season where we have to do everything we can to win every game, win every series,” DeJong said. “At this point of the season, an early lead can do a lot. Ideally, we just try to put the pressure on them right away in games we’ve got to win.”	Brault (0-1) gave up two runs and five hits in five innings in his second start of the season. He returned to the active roster last week after missing four months with a strained left lat muscle.	“He gave us a chance to win,” Shelton said. “He continues to improve, continues to execute pitches.”	Rookie Dylan Carlson had three of the Cardinals’ eight hits and scored on shortstop Kevin Newman’s fielding error during a two-run sixth inning that pushed the lead to 4-1. Harrison Bader followed the miscue with an RBI single.	GONZALEZ OUTRIGHTED	Utility player Erik Gonzalez has cleared waivers and been assigned to Triple-A Indianapolis by the Pirates. He was designated for assignment last week.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Cardinals: RHP Jack Flaherty (strained left oblique) will be activated from the 60-day injured list Friday and start at Kansas City that night. He has been out since June 1. … LHP Kwang Hyun Kim (left elbow inflammation) was placed on the 10-day IL and RHP Daniel Ponce de Leon (right shoulder discomfort) was activated from the 10-day IL. An MRI revealed no structural damage in Kim’s elbow. … RHP Miles Mikolas (right forearm tightness) will make one more rehab start before activated. He has pitched twice for Triple-A Memphis and twice for Double-A Springfield. … LF Tyler O’Neill sat out after having his second COVID-19 vaccination shot earlier in the day.	Pirates: OF Ka’ai Tom (low back strain) began a rehab assignment with Indianapolis on Tuesday.	UP NEXT	RHP Adam Wainwright (10-6, 3.48) starts for the Cardinals on Wednesday night against RHP Wil Crowe (3-6, 5.47).	Wainwright has won seven straight decisions against the Pirates since losing to them on opening day in 2016. Crowe has given up a run in either the first or second inning in 13 of his 16 starts this season.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

CLEVELAND -- — Jed Lowrie delivered an RBI double in the 10th inning and the Oakland Athletics extended their winning streak to five, beating the Cleveland Indians 4-3 on Tuesday night.	Oakland moved into sole possession of the top AL wild-card spot, one game ahead of Boston.	Indians reliever Nick Wittgren (2-5) retired the first two batters in the 10th before intentionally walking Matt Olson. Lowrie followed with a double to left field, scoring automatic runner Elvis Andrus.	“Lowrie is a good hitter, no doubt, and he put a good swing on it,” Cleveland acting manager DeMarlo Hale said. “I thought we had a better matchup with him by walking Olson, but those are choices you’ve got to make sometimes.”	Lou Trivino (5-4) pitched a scoreless ninth and Andrew Chafin earned his first save of the season.	Athletics relievers Burch Smith, A.J. Puk, Yusmeiro Petit, Sergio Romo, Trivino and Chafin held the Indians hitless for the final six innings.	“The bullpen was great, we made some big plays in the field, and we had timely hitting,” Smith said. “It was an all-around good game for us.”	Cleveland carried a 3-2 lead into the eighth, but Oakland tied it off James Karinchak with one out. Starling Marte singled, stole second and came home on Lowrie’s grounder.	Seth Brown homered, singled and stole a base for the Athletics, who began their second 10-game road trip of the summer.	Marte was 1 for 5, dropping his average with Oakland to .400 in 10 games since being acquired from Miami. He also stole his 30th base of the season.	“At least one facet of everything that Starling brings to the table comes through in every game,” Athletics manager Bob Melvin said. “We’re thrilled to have him.”	Amed Rosario and Myles Straw each had two hits for Cleveland — Rosario got the 500th of his career. The Indians are a season-high 10 1/2 games out of first place in the AL Central.	Triston McKenzie extended his home winless streak to eight starts, allowing two runs in six innings while striking out five. The right-hander’s only victory at Progressive Field occurred in his MLB debut against Detroit on Aug. 22, 2020.	“I feel like we’re putting ourselves in position to win ballgames,” McKenzie said. “As starting pitchers, we want that, to give the team a chance to come out on top.”	Athletics left-hander Sean Manaea made his shortest start of the season at 1 2/3 innings, giving up three runs and five hits on 69 pitches.	Josh Harrison doubled and scored for Oakland. He left in the sixth after being struck by a pitch on the top of his left hand, and X-rays were negative.	Athletics left fielder Mark Canha exited in the 10th with irritation in his right eye.	LONG TIME	The Athletics played in Cleveland for the first time since May 22, 2019, a span of 811 days.	ROCK OF AGES	A statue of Indians great Rocky Colavito was unveiled earlier in the day in the Little Italy neighborhood of Cleveland. The fan favorite celebrated his 88th birthday at Progressive Field, receiving warm applause when introduced during the game.	Colavito played eight seasons in two stints for the Indians, hitting 190 of his 374 career home runs with the franchise. The nine-time All-Star led the AL with 42 homers in 1959, but was infamously traded to Detroit for Harvey Kuenn the next year.	Former Tigers teammates Denny McLain and Willie Horton accompanied Colavito to the ceremony.	MOVING ON UP	Puk -- the A’s top pitching prospect -- was recalled from Triple-A Las Vegas and worked one scoreless inning. The 6-foot-7 lefty posted a 1.64 ERA in 13 appearances with the Aviators since June 26, showing no signs of the arm troubles that plagued him for the past year. “A.J. is here as a reliever,” Melvin said. “We’re good with our starters and (RHP Daulton) Jefferies would be the next in line.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Athletics: RHP James Kaprielian (right shoulder soreness) reported no physical problems after working six innings Sunday in a 6-3 win over Texas. Kaprielian had been on the 10-day injured list from July 28 to Aug. 7 with a shoulder impingement.	Indians: C Roberto Pérez (right shoulder inflammation), who was placed on the 10-day IL on Aug. 4, is eligible to be activated this weekend when Cleveland visits Detroit. Pérez missed 52 games earlier this season with a broken right ring finger.	UP NEXT	Athletics: RHP Frankie Montas (9-8, 4.10 ERA) has 45 strikeouts in his last 31 2/3 innings, the most by an Oakland pitcher over a five-game span since Todd Stottlemyre had 46 in 1995.	Indians: RHP Cal Quantrill (3-2, 3.14 ERA) has only allowed three earned runs and 19 hits during his last five starts, posting a 2-0 record with a 0.90 ERA and 28 strikeouts in 30 innings.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BOSTON -- — Tampa Bay's Francisco Mejía singled with the bases loaded in the ninth, Boston's Hunter Renfroe made a costly error on the play, and it helped the Rays rally past the Red Sox 8-4 on Tuesday night.	Tampa Bay's lead in the AL East is now up to five games.	The Rays were 2 of 9 with runners in scoring position before Mejía, who entered the game as a defensive substitution in the seventh, delivered a single to right. The ball skipped past Renfroe for an error and that allowed all three runners to score, giving Tampa Bay a 7-4 lead.	“He was ready for it and just laced a big double — whatever it was — right down the line for just huge runs for us,” manager Kevin Cash said.	Officially, Mejía was credited with a single and two RBI and the Rays added another run on Brandon Lowe’s single. Louis Head shut down Boston in order in the ninth to finish off the Red Sox, who lost for the 10th time in 12 games.	Lowe also homered for the Rays, who got a two-run double from pinch-hitter Ji-Man Choi to tie it at 4-all in the seventh after Boston had led 4-1.	“For Ji to come off the bench like that and put together the at-bat that he does, it’s very impressive and a huge testament to him,” Lowe said.	Andrew Kittredge (8-1) pitched two scoreless innings of relief for Tampa Bay.	The Red Sox blew a game they desperately needed, coming off a 2-8 road trip that started with a three-game sweep by the Rays in Tampa Bay. Matt Barnes (6-5) pitched the ninth for Boston and took his second straight loss.	“We didn’t make pitches with two strikes and they got to Barnesy at the end,” Boston manager Alex Cora said. “It’s been a grind for him lately and it was a grind for us tonight.”	Renfroe hit a three-run homer for Boston in the fourth and Rafael Devers led off the second with his 28th homer of the year.	Eduardo Rodríguez gave Boston a solid start, striking out eight over 5 1/3 innings. He allowed two runs on four hits and a walk, getting pulled in the sixth after Wander Franco’s RBI single scored Mike Zunino to pull the Rays within 4-2.	The only other run allowed by Rodríguez was Lowe’s 25th homer in the third.	Luis Patino pitched six innings for the Rays, allowing four runs on six hits and three walks. He struck out seven.	PULLING AWAY	The Rays improved to a season-best 25 games above .500 at 69-44. It was Tampa Bay's 36th come-from-behind victory and the Rays were feeling perfectly comfortable atop the division standings.	“I don’t think there’s one person in our locker room that thinks there is too big of a deficit to come back from, honestly,” Lowe said. “We all believe in each other to go up there and put together productive at-bats and it’s just how it rolls. One guy gets on, the next guy gets on and all of a sudden there’s a rally going. ”	STILL SLUMPING	Barnes also took the loss Sunday at Toronto, when he entered with two outs in the eighth and an 8-6 lead before George Springer's three-run homer helped the Blue Jays rally to a 9-8 win.	Cora said Barnes has actually been pitching well and the losing burden doesn't all solely on the Boston closer.	“For us to be better, everybody has to contribute. I think it’s more that than anything else. We still trust the guy. We know he’s good,” Cora said.	Boston fell to 10-14 since the All-Star break and lost its sixth straight to Tampa Bay.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Rays: Reinstated outfield Randy Arozarena from the COVID-19 IL and had him batting leadoff. Arozarena drove the first pitch of the game for a single to center. ... Tampa Bay also placed LHP Ryan Yarbrough on the COVID-19 IL and placed RHP DJ Johnson (right shoulder sprain) on the 10-day IL, retroactive to Monday. Manager Kevin Cash said Johnson could have a slight muscle tear and was getting second opinions. ... After his pinch-hit double tied it in the seventh, Choi was immediately replaced by a pinch-runner because of soreness in his left hamstring.	Red Sox: OF/1B Kyle Schwarber (strained right hamstring, left groin soreness) has been working out and is getting closer to making his debut for Boston, but manager Alex Cora would not say when he hopes to have Schwarber added to the lineup. Schwarber was acquired from the Washington Nationals before the trade deadline and has yet to play for the Red Sox. ... Cora said LHP Chris Sale was still on track to rejoin the team and start Saturday against Baltimore. Sale is recovering from Tommy John surgery and has not pitched in the majors since Aug. 13, 2019.	UP NEXT	Rays: Tampa Bay hasn't named a starter for Wednesday's game. Cash said the could go with an “opener” to pitch the first couple of innings, then turn it over to the bullpen, or possibly start LHP Josh Fleming (9-5, 4.12 ERA).	Red Sox: RHP Nathan Eovaldi (9-7, 4.07) gets his first start since allowing a season-high seven runs over 4 2/3 innings Friday in a loss at Toronto. It was only the third time in 22 starts that Eovaldi failed to complete five innings.	------	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

NEW YORK -- — Pinch-hitter Brandon Drury delivered a tiebreaking single in the eighth inning and the New York Mets rallied from a pair of three-run deficits to defeat the Washington Nationals 8-7 on Wednesday in the resumption of a game suspended by rain the night before.	Pete Alonso broke out of an 0-for-21 slump with three hits, including an RBI double off the center-field fence that pulled the Mets to 7-6 in the seventh. New York tied it on a throwing error by 6-foot-7 rookie reliever Mason Thompson (0-1) in the eighth and snapped a season-worst four-game slide, winning for only the third time in 12 games.	The teams were then set to play their regularly scheduled game Wednesday night, making it a single-admission doubleheader at Citi Field — though the nightcap was shortened to seven innings under pandemic rules.	Juan Soto hit a three-run homer Tuesday night and finished 3 for 4 with a walk in his return to the starting lineup from a sore knee. Washington went up 7-4 in the fifth with the help of a two-run double by Luis Garcia, but its shaky and unproven bullpen couldn't hold it.	J.D. Davis led off the eighth with a double and scored when Thompson threw away Jonathan Villar's sacrifice bunt. One out later, Drury fisted a soft single into shallow center over a drawn-in infield — the ball landed at the back of the infield dirt.	Trevor May (5-2) worked a perfect inning and Edwin Díaz got three quick outs for his 24th save, striking out Soto to start the ninth.	Washington, which tore down its team in a huge selloff at the trade deadline, has dropped seven of eight.	The game resumed in a mostly empty ballpark with the Nationals leading 3-1 in the top of the second.	With the nightcap shortened to seven innings, both teams changed pitching plans in the opener. New York put 41-year-old lefty Rich Hill on the mound when the game resumed, and Washington turned to Joe Ross.	Hill had been scheduled to start Thursday, and Ross was originally lined up for Wednesday night.	LONG AND WINDING ROAD	Washington optioned left-handed reliever Sam Clay to Triple-A Rochester and selected the contract of LHP Sean Nolin, who returned to the majors for the first time since 2015 with Oakland. The 31-year-old Nolin pitched in Japan last year and was 3-3 with a 3.80 ERA in 11 games (nine starts) for Rochester this season.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Nationals: Manager Dave Martinez said Soto (sore right knee) felt fine after the game was stopped Tuesday night. He kept warm during the rain delay and received some more treatment. Soto remained in the lineup Wednesday, but Martinez didn't commit to starting the slugger in the nightcap. “We’ll see how he feels after the first game and we’ll go from there,” the manager said. Soto was limited to a pair of pinch-hitting appearances over the previous three games against Atlanta last weekend due to a sore right knee. ... RHP Stephen Strasburg, recovering from season-ending neck surgery, was transferred to the 60-day injured list to open a 40-man roster spot for Nolin.	Mets: SS Francisco Lindor (right oblique strain) simulated game situations at shortstop and took batting practice on the field for the first time since getting injured July 16. He'll have a light day Thursday, manager Luis Rojas said, but there's no next step in place yet. “He looked good,” Rojas said. ... Javier Báez (lower back) pinch-hit in the sixth and struck out on three pitches with a runner on to end the inning. Báez was initially announced as Drury over the public address system. ... The team is eyeing Noah Syndergaard as a potential reliever if he can return from Tommy John surgery in September.	OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS	Technically, it was the first major league relief appearance for Hill since 2014 with the Yankees. After he was moved back up to pitch Wednesday, the Mets need a starter for the series finale Thursday, and right-hander Trevor Williams is an option to make his New York debut. Williams, acquired with Báez from the Cubs at the July 30 trade deadline, has been pitching at Triple-A Syracuse.	ROSTER MOVE	New York planned to recall RHP Geoff Hartlieb from Triple-A Syracuse as the 27th man for the second game of the doubleheader.	UP NEXT	Nationals: A bullpen game in the nightcap, but Washington had not announced its opener.	Mets: RHP Marcus Stroman (7-11, 2.83 ERA) has lost three straight starts and is 1-7 in his past 10.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ATLANTA -- — Adam Duvall hit a two-run homer, Stephen Vogt's bases-loaded walk in the sixth forced in the go-ahead run and the Atlanta Braves beat the Cincinnati Reds 3-2 in a matchup of second-place teams on Tuesday night.	Drew Smyly (8-3) recovered after allowing a two-run home run to Aristides Aquino in the second inning. Smyly allowed two runs on only two hits and two walks and seven strikeouts in six innings. The left-hander won his sixth consecutive decision.	“That was a heck of an outing against a really good offensive club,” Braves manager Brian Snitker said.	Will Smith gave up a one-out double to Kyle Farmer in the ninth. Smith walked Eugenio Suárez before pinch-hitter Mike Moustakas hit into a game-ending double play. Smith earned his 23rd save in 26 chances.	Duvall's homer, his 25th, tied the game in the fourth.	The Braves began the night two games behind Philadelphia in the NL East. The Reds were six games behind Milwaukee in the NL Central.	The Braves had six walks and only five hits. Dansby Swanson and Joc Pederson each had two walks.	“It just gives us more opportunities to be able to score runs and do it different ways,” Swanson said. “Do it with walks, with plate discipline.”	Heath Hembree (2-7) and Amir Garrett combined to walk three batters in the sixth, helping the Braves break a 2-2 tie.	Hembree gave up a single to Austin Riley before walking Swanson. With one out, Garrett issued back-to-back walks to Pederson and Vogt, forcing in a run.	Reds manager David Bell wouldn't blame the loss on his bullpen.	“You look at the big picture and our pitching allowed three runs tonight,” Bell said. “So I think the story was more our offense and the pitching the Braves threw against us.”	Reds starter Sonny Gray allowed two runs with eight strikeouts in five innings.	Braves right-hander Luke Jackson walked Suárez with two outs in the seventh before surviving a scare when Shogo Akiyama's fly ball was caught at the right field wall by Jorge Soler.	Left-hander Tyler Matzek struck out Joey Votto on a called third strike to end the eighth with runners on first and second.	The Reds' eighth was extended when they successfully appealed the call on the field that pinch-runner Tyler Naquin was forced out at first base on Tyler Stephenson's lineout to Swanson at shortstop. The call was overturned when the replay showed Naquin beat Swanson's throw to first base.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Reds: OF/IF Nick Senzel (left knee inflammation) has played five games in the outfield and one at DH in his rehab assignment with Triple-A Louisville. Bell said Senzel will see time in the infield while playing two or three more games before being activated. Bell said RHP Tejay Antone (right forearm strain) needs “a few more” rehab games after feeling no pain in his first outing with Louisville.	Braves: Snitker said C Travis d'Arnaud (left thumb strain) is expected to be activated and return to the starting lineup for Wednesday night's game. ... OF Eddie Rosario (abdominal strain), acquired from Minnesota on July 30, began his rehab assignment with Triple-A Gwinnett. ... RHP Shane Greene was designated for assignment and LHP A.J. Minter was recalled from Gwinnett. Greene had an 8.47 ERA in 19 games. ... 1B Freddie Freeman (upper respiratory infection) returned after missing one start and exiting after the first inning of another game.	OVERTHINKING	Garrett has a 6.42 ERA and has issued 24 walks in 33 2/3 innings. He said he's thinking too much on the mound.	“It’s an uphill battle for me right now with the walks and everything,” Garrett said. “... I’ve got to go back to not thinking, just throw the ball over the plate and let my pitches work. ... Whatever happens, happens.”	FAN SUPPORT	The attendance was 24,432. The Braves, who began allowing full capacity on May 7, before many teams, began the night leading the majors in total home attendance (1,644,081) and average per game (29,358).	UP NEXT	The Reds will send LHP Wade Miley (9-4, 2.75) to the mound to face Braves RHP Touki Toussaint (1-2, 4.43) on Wednesday. Miley is 2-2 with a 4.91 ERA in seven career games, including six starts, against Atlanta. Toussaint will look for his first win since his first start of 2021 on July 20. He will be making his first career start against the Reds.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

CHICAGO -- — Luis Urías had two hits during a six-run, fifth-inning rally as the Milwaukee Brewers beat the Chicago Cubs 6-3 Tuesday night to complete a doubleheader sweep.	The nightcap was delayed for an hour, 29 minutes because of rain with one out in the top of the third, which limited starter Aaron Ashby to two scoreless innings.	The Brewers then used six pitchers to complete the final five innings. Miguel Sanchez (1-0) threw one pitch to get the final out in the fourth inning for his first win in the majors. Brent Suter got the final four outs for his first career save.	The NL Central leaders are a major league-best 36-19 on the road.	Patrick Wisdom homered for Chicago, which has dropped six straight.	“It was a long day, for sure,” Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. “It was kind of a mental test as well as a physical test. It was a great way to end the night.”	In the opener, Freddy Peralta pitched effectively into the sixth inning and Avisail García smacked a go-ahead two-run homer in Milwaukee's 4-2 win. Willy Adames and Lorenzo Cain also went deep.	In the nightcap, the Brewers strung together hits to take command after Wisdom led off the fourth with an opposite-field homer to give the Cubs a 1-0 lead.	Urías led off the fifth with a double and scored one out later on a double by Jackie Bradley Jr. García then pinch hit and walked to put runners on first and second.	Left-hander Kyle Ryan came on to replace Dan Winkler (1-3) and advanced the runners a base with a wild pitch. Christian Yelich then put Milwaukee on top with an RBI groundout. After Adamas was walked intentionally, Omar Narváez hit an RBI single to make it 3-1.	Right-hander Jake Jewell replaced Ryan and gave up consecutive run-scoring singles to Eduardo Escobar, Rowdy Tellez and Urías to make it 6-1.	In the first game, Peralta (9-3) allowed two runs on five hits in 5 1/3 innings. The All-Star right-hander struck out eight and walked two on a sweltering afternoon.	“I thought Freddy pitched really well,” Counsell said. “The conditions were difficult. He probably ran out of gas in a spot he usually doesn't because of the heat.”	Devin Williams got the final three outs for his second save after loading the bases with one out in the seventh. Williams struck out Wisdom and Greg Deichmann to end it.	Frank Schwindel had an RBI double and Rafael Ortega added three hits for Chicago in the opener.	Cubs rookie Justin Steele (2-1) allowed three runs on five hits in five innings during his first career start. The left-hander was 2-0 with a 2.03 ERA in 11 relief appearances for Chicago earlier in the season. Following a stint on the injured list with a right hamstring strain, the 26-year-old was sent to Triple-A Iowa to stretch out as a starter. He was recalled before the game.	“It felt good to be back at Wrigley,” Steele said. “I made a few mistakes and they took advantage. I think I did all right. It's something to build on.”	Trailing 1-0, Adames led off the fourth with his 21st homer. After Escobar doubled, García stroked a 457-foot blast to center to make it 3-1. It was García's 20th homer, tying his career high from 2019.	“I'm thinking small,” he said. “I'm not trying to hit homers. I'm thinking the middle of the field and not trying to do too much.”	ROSTER MOVES	The Brewers activated RHP Jake Cousins from the COVID-19 injured list before the doubleheader and designated RHP Sal Romano for assignment.	To make room for Steele on the roster, the Cubs optioned Ryan to Triple-A Iowa. Ryan was then recalled for the second game as the 27th man. Chicago also activated RHP Rowan Wick (left oblique strain) before the nightcap and optioned RHP Trevor Megill to Iowa.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: RHP John Curtiss left in the fourth with elbow tightness.	UP NEXT	Cubs RHP Jake Arrieta (5-10, 6.35 ERA) looks to snap out of a prolonged funk Wednesday night in the third game of the series. RHP Corbin Burnes (6-4, 2.39 ERA) pitches for the Brewers. Arrieta is 0-4 with a 9.62 ERA in his last seven starts.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

MINNEAPOLIS -- — Dallas Keuchel was out of whack at the start with three walks in a two-run first inning.	The pitch that truly hurt the Chicago left-hander was the one he wanted to keep way out of the strike zone against Willians Astudillo, but Minnesota's energy man made him pay.	Astudillo hit a go-ahead, two-run homer  in the sixth inning off Keuchel, and the Twins held on for a 4-3 victory to stop a four-game winning streak for the White Sox on Tuesday night.	“The pitch was three or four inches inside, so you’ve got to kind of just tip your cap to it,” said Keuchel, who allowed four runs in six innings with one strikeout.	Rookie starter Griffin Jax (3-1) gave the Twins a career-high six innings, after falling behind 3-2 on consecutive homers by Adam Engel and José Abreu in the third.	Jax, the first Air Force Academy graduate to appear in the major leagues, struck out a career-best 10 batters with only one walk against an intimidating White Sox offense that has homered in a season-most 12 straight games.	“You get one guy out and you turn your back and look at the plate, and then there’s another All-Star up there. I knew that going into the game that this was going to be a pretty tough lineup, but I was pretty proud of myself,” Jax said.	Said Twins manager Rocco Baldelli: “He really personifies a lot of the things that we’re looking for in our guys, and he handles himself very, very well.”	Keuchel (7-6) was left with a decidedly different feeling, after falling to 1-4 with a 5.72 ERA and 10 homers allowed in his last seven turns. He walked four in six innings, and three of those runners scored, including Miguel Sanó before Astudillo's big hit. The burly utilityman nicknamed La Tortuga dropped to one knee and muscled a 1-0 pitch into the left-field bleachers.	“You’re really never sure what he’s going to do,” Baldelli said. “Sometimes he does more damage on pitches six inches above the zone or in or down. You really don’t know.”	Said Keuchel: “That was just kind of the setup pitch. I wouldn’t take that pitch back.”	Astudillo, playing third base for Josh Donaldson, later caught a line drive smashed by Abreu and whipped a throw to first base to double up Tim Anderson and end the eighth as he skipped off the field with his infectious enthusiasm.	“That’s not even a baserunning mistake, because the ball was hit so hard,” White Sox manager Tony La Russa said. “That was just a tough break for us and a good break for them.”	The White Sox (67-47) whiffed on their opportunity to move a season-high 22 games above .500, a mark they haven’t reached since Sept. 13, 2006, but there’s not much for them to worry about with a lead on Cleveland that was at 10 1/2 games at the beginning of the day. Now that they’re nearly fully healthy again, their biggest challenge will be to stay sharp for the next two months in lieu of a pennant race in this division full of renovation projects.	Luis Arraez had an RBI single and Alex Colome pitched the ninth for his sixth save for the Twins, who improved to 5-13 against the AL Central leaders this year. They have been outscored 123-70 by the White Sox, who are 37-24 against division opponents.	Arraez has hit in 21 of his last 23 games, batting .423 since July 4 for the best average in baseball among players with a minimum of 70 plate appearances.	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox: CF Luis Robert reported no trouble after his return from a torn hip flexor on Monday following an 85-game absence. He's slated for a day off on Wednesday.	Twins: CF Byron Buxton, who has missed 42 games because of a broken left pinkie, is in the final stretch of his recovery and “in a good state of mind.” The team has yet to decide whether to send him on a rehab assignment. “If they want me to go, I’ll go. If they don’t, great,” Buxton said. ... Donaldson was in the lineup as the DH for the first time in four games due to a hamstring strain. He's slated to be back at 3B on Friday.	UP NEXT	White Sox: RHP Lance Lynn (10-3, 2.04), the major league ERA leader, takes the mound on Wednesday afternoon. He's 2-0 with a 1.50 ERA in four starts against the Twins this season.	Twins: RHP Bailey Ober (1-1, 4.99) pitches in the series finale. The rookie is 1-1 with a 6.23 ERA in four turns against the White Sox this year.	------	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

HOUSTON -- — Jake Odorizzi and four relievers combined on a five-hit shutout, Taylor Jones had a two-run double and the Houston Astros beat Colorado 5-0 Tuesday night, snapping the Rockies’ four-game winning streak.	Houston got to Colorado starter Jon Gray (7-8) in the fourth, scoring three runs. Chas McCormick had an RBI single, and Jones followed with his double. Jones and McCormick each finished with two hits.	“Those at bats were timely,” Houston manager Dusty Baker said of Jones and McCormick. “They were premium at bats. … You get those two-out RBI hits, you are going to win most games. The bottom of the lineup came through for us.”	Michael Brantley had an RBI double in the fifth, and José Altuve added an RBI single in the sixth.	Odorizzi (5-6) scattered three hits and struck out three in five innings.	“He seemed more relaxed today,” Baker said. “He was throwing it. He was finding his spots. … He threw the ball well.”	Odorizzi rebounded nicely after struggling in his previous four starts since the All-Star break, allowing 17 runs and eight home runs, including seven runs and four home runs in his last outing Wednesday against the Dodgers.	Odorizzi said he did more dry repetitions along with his bullpen since the start in Los Angeles to work on his mechanics and get comfortable.	“The more I repeat it, the more likely it is to translate to the game,” Odorizzi said. “The difference today between the other day was that balls weren’t running back over the plate. They had life to them, as opposed to balls that were going glove side and running back arm side, so that’s a good sign that we’re going in the right direction.”	Cristian Javier threw two innings, Blake Taylor tossed 2/3 of an inning, Yimi Garcia worked 1/3 of an inning and Pedro Báez, who was activated off the 60-day injured list earlier in the day, pitched the ninth.	Colorado manager Bud Black said the Astros pitched pretty well, and his offense couldn’t string anything together.	“We had some good swings,” Black said. “We just couldn’t square up the high fastball that Odorizzi featured, and the same with Javier. … Overall, there were some high fastballs we couldn’t connect on. Good swings, foul balls, but just couldn’t get them in play with any authority.”	Gray allowed four runs on six hits with nine strikeouts in 4 1/3 innings. It was the highest run total allowed by Gray since coming off the injured list on June 25.	“I just lost command and control in the fourth and fifth,” Gray said. “I thought we commanded the ball well in the first innings, and then all of a sudden, it just kind of went wild. There’s some things I need to work on mechanically that could have something to do with it, but overall, it was a disappointment.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Rockies: OF Raimel Tapia was placed on the 10-day injured list on Tuesday with a right big toe strain. Colorado selected the contract of 3B Taylor Motter from Triple-A Albuquerque to take Tapia’s spot on the roster. … 2B Brendan Rogers was out of the lineup for a second straight game after suffering a bruised right hand when he was hit by a pitch on Saturday. Black said he was a little sore, but improving, and could be ready to return as soon as Wednesday.	Astros: RHP Rafael Montero was placed on the 10-day IL with right shoulder discomfort. … RHP Andre Scrubb (right shoulder strain) was transferred to the 60-day IL to make room on the 40-man roster for Báez. … RHP José Urquidy (right shoulder discomfort) threw a bullpen on Tuesday and was expected to leave for Florida on Wednesday to begin a rehabilitation assignment, Baker said.	BREGMAN ‘NOT READY’	Astros 3B Alex Bregman, who has been out since June 17 with a left quad strain, returned to Houston from a rehabilitation assignment with Triple-A Sugar Land on Sunday because his 20-day rehab window had ended, per league rules, Baker said. Bregman will stay with the Astros for five days then return to Sugar Land to start a new 20-day rehab window on Friday, Baker said.	“He’s not ready,” Baker said, adding the team didn’t want to rush Bregman’s return to the lineup and risk reaggravating the injury.	UP NEXT	LHP Framber Valdez (7-3, 3.22 ERA) will start the finale of the two-game series Wednesday for the Astros opposite Colorado RHP Antonio Senzatela (2-8, 4.73 ERA).	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- — Salvador Perez homered twice to set a career high with 29 this season, and the Kansas City Royals rallied to beat the New York Yankees 8-4 on Tuesday night.	Perez put the Royals ahead with a two-run blast in the first inning estimated at 418 feet, and he tied the game at 4 leading off the sixth. It was the fourth multi-homer game this season and 10th of his career for Perez, who marked the 10th anniversary of his major league debut.	“Tonight was amazing, especially because we won the game,” Perez said. “That’s the most important thing.	“The 10 years have gone quickly. It was a dream come true to play in the big leagues. Hopefully I can stay here and play for another 10 years.”	A night earlier, the Royals became the first team since 1900 to erase a deficit in the seventh, eighth, ninth and 10th innings before falling to New York in 11. This time, Kansas City pushed ahead and stayed there following Perez's tying homer off Nestor Cortes (0-1). Later in the sixth, Hunter Dozier doubled against Stephen Ridings to score Emmanuel Rivera from first.	“Obviously Salvy (Perez) got (Cortes) a couple of times for big blows,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. “We had some mistakes in the strike zone and they made us pay. Overall, we didn’t play our best tonight.”	The Royals played small ball to extend their lead. Michael A. Taylor led off the seventh with a double. Hanser Alberto put down a sacrifice bunt, and Taylor scored on a throwing error by Ridings. Alberto scored on a safety squeeze by Nicky Lopez.	Alberto added a sacrifice fly in the eighth.	“We went about it a little differently. It was a lot of the things we talk so much about, the situational hitting. It’s a shame the game doesn’t appreciate those plays as much as it should,” Royals manager Mike Matheny said. “I thought today was one of our better ballgames all the way around, being the type of team the Kansas City Royals are.”	Reliever Josh Staumont (2-2) retired all four batters he faced, striking out three, one of five Kansas City pitchers who held New York to five hits.	Kyle Higashioka hit a two-run homer for the Yankees, who have lost two of three following a five-game winning streak. New York is trying to chase down Tampa Bay and slumping Boston in the AL East and Boston and Oakland in the wild-card race.	Higashioka's homer put New York ahead 3-2 in the fourth, but the Royals tied it in the fifth when Whit Merrifield scored on catcher Higashioka's throwing error.	D.J. LeMahieu's RBI single gave the Yankees a 4-3 lead in the sixth.	ROSTER MOVE	OF Edward Olivares was the victim of the Royals using seven relievers Monday night as he was optioned to Triple-A Omaha to make room for RHP Joel Payamps, who was recalled.	UP NEXT	The Yankees have not announced a starter for the final game of the series on Wednesday. New York has won 11 consecutive series against the Royals, who will start right-hander Brady Singer (3-7, 5.13 ERA).	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN FRANCISCO -- — Buster Posey's baserunning skills played a big part in the Giants keeping their latest winning streak going.	LaMonte Wade Jr. scored the winning run from third with two outs in the ninth inning when first baseman Christian Walker was unable to handle Kris Bryant's sharp grounder, and San Francisco's players danced on the field Tuesday night celebrating an 8-7 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks.	Walker was charged with a tough error that gave the NL West-leading Giants their third straight win and fifth in six games. They earned this one the hard way after going up 5-0 in the fifth inning of a game matching the top team in the majors against the worst.	Brandon Crawford hit a go-ahead double in the eighth and Posey homered. After scoring from first on Crawford's hit, Posey came up from his feet-first slide smiling and told Bryant, “I'm so fast.”	“That was most definitely sarcasm,” Posey said. “I was just happy that I made it there.”	Asdrúbal Cabrera tied the game with a two-run homer in the Diamondbacks' five-run sixth. Arizona produced three straight doubles to rally and five extra-base hits in all that inning, capped by Cabrera's seventh homer.	Crawford came through against Joe Mantiply and later scored on an error before Jake McGee blew the save, allowing his first earned runs since May 30. He issued a bases-loaded walk to pinch-hitter Josh VanMeter and gave up a tying sacrifice fly to Nick Ahmed before Zack Littell (1-0) relieved.	Matt Peacock (5-7) took the loss.	Bryant hit an RBI double in the first and Mike Yastrzemski followed with a two-run double that made it 3-0 as Zac Gallen received an early mound visit. Posey connected in the fifth for his 14th homer and glanced at the Arizona dugout, perhaps looking for old pal Madison Bumgarner.	Brandon Belt doubled in the first to extend his career-best hitting streak to 14 games and scored on Bryant’s hit as San Francisco got going.	But starter Alex Wood couldn't hold a five-run lead. He had been in line to reach double-digit wins for the first time since a career-high 16 victories in 2017 for the Dodgers.	Gallen's winless stretch is now 11 starts in which he's 0-6 since a victory at Atlanta on April 25.	With a full slate of games, no starting pitchers in the majors Tuesday went more than six innings for the first time in major league history, according to STATS.	“You see the trend of the game. The pitch count's one thing — you don't necessarily see guys go above 110. I feel like a few years ago that was more commonplace. Teams are building their bullpens,” Gallen said, noting it was still “shocking” to hear.	Diamondbacks second baseman Josh Rojas was 0 for 4 with three strikeouts after coming off the injured list from a dislocated left finger.	WOTUS' MARK	Longtime Giants coach Ron Wotus, currently stationed at third base, earned his 2,000th victory with the franchise.	“He's one of the best,” Posey said.	The team toasted him afterward and Wotus said, “I'm honored that they're even acknowledging it."	SALUTE TO MADBUM	Bumgarner made his first trip back to Oracle Park with fans in the stands since the star pitcher and 2014 World Series MVP left the Giants after the 2019 season to join Arizona on an $85 million, five-year contract following 11 years with the Giants.	He was recognized on the big screen in the middle of the second. Bumgarner, clearly touched by the warm ovation, hopped the dugout railing, waved and put his hand on his heart in appreciation.	“Bum did incredible things here and will always be beloved," Posey said. “It was cool to see him get that ovation.”	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: RHP Noé Ramirez has been cleared from the COVID-19 injured list to resume baseball activities at Salt River Fields after being out since July 30. OF Stuart Fairchild, also sidelined by the coronavirus, was one day behind Ramirez's schedule and should be cleared soon, manager Torey Lovullo said. Ramirez still must go through some of the Diamondbacks' protocols in the next 24 hours or so. ... RHP Luke Weaver, working back from a strained rotator cuff in his pitching shoulder, threw three innings and 48 pitches in a start Monday for the club's rookie ball affiliate and allowed four hits while striking out six. He played catch Tuesday and is set to pitch again Friday. ... LHP Caleb Smith (3-8, 5.48 ERA), who had started regularly since June 1, is moving back to the bullpen. He has made 31 appearances in 2021 with 13 starts.	Giants: 3B Evan Longoria's timetable for a return remains unclear as he works back from a sprained left shoulder he injured July 5 in a collision with Crawford. Longoria still could need more minor league at-bats. “Before we make the decision to activate him, we want the assurance that he feels good to go. We're just not quite there yet,” manager Gabe Kapler said. “We don't have anything immediate planned beyond letting him recover today."	ROSTER MOVES	Giants: San Francisco recalled RHP Camilo Doval from Triple-A Sacramento and optioned RHP John Brebbia to Sacramento.	Diamondbacks: Arizona released OF Josh Reddick during Monday's off day after he was designated for assignment last Thursday. INF Jake Hager was optioned to Reno after Sunday's game at San Diego.	UP NEXT	RHP Merrill Kelly (7-8, 4.13) pitches Wednesday for the Diamondbacks after going 5-1 with a 2.44 ERA over his last nine starts since June 21. The Giants counter with All-Star RHP Kevin Gausman (10-5, 2.31), who will try to win consecutive starts for the first time since May 30 and June 5. He went on emergency family leave last month as wife Taylor dealt with pregnancy complications before delivering a healthy baby girl.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- — Shohei Ohtani and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. were both kept in the ballpark during Tuesday's doubleheader.	Still, the top two home run hitters in the majors wound up center stage in the second game.	Guerrero hit an early RBI single and Ohtani struck out with the bases loaded for the final out as the Toronto Blue Jays beat the Los Angeles Angels 4-0 to split an unusual twinbill.	Justin Upton and Phil Gosselin each had two hits and two RBI to help the Angels win the opener 6-3.	Toronto batted last and was the “home” team at Angel Stadium in the first game, a makeup from an April 11 rainout at the Blue Jays’ temporary home field early this season in Dunedin, Florida. In the regularly scheduled nightcap, the Angels were the home team.	Ohtani, who leads the majors with 37 homers, led off the second game with a triple against Ross Stripling into the right-field corner. That was Los Angeles' only hit until the seventh inning, when Brandon Marsh and Kurt Suzuki got aboard with base hits. Jack Mayfield drew a walk with two outs before Jordan Romano struck out Ohtani on a 99 mph fastball to end the game.	“It was an ever better win just because of the way it ended. No one wanted Ohtani to come up with the bases loaded, but that tells you the type of pitcher Romano is,” Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said. “He went right after him and did a great job against one of the best hitters in baseball.”	Guerrero, who has 35 home runs, gave Toronto a 1-0 lead in the first with an RBI single and then scored on Teoscar Hernandez's bloop single. Lourdes Gurriel Jr. added a two-run single with the bases loaded in the sixth.	Guerrero had a huge fielding miscue in the first game when he misplayed Jo Adell’s popup in the fifth inning. He was unable to track the ball behind first base and let it glance off his glove as two runs scored to extend Los Angeles’ lead to 4-1.	Stripling was removed after the second inning of the nightcap due to a right oblique strain. Trevor Richards (1-1) worked two scoreless innings. It was Toronto's 11th shutout, which is tied for fifth in the majors.	Los Angeles starter José Suarez (5-5) yielded four runs and seven hits with a walk and two strikeouts in 5 1/3 innings.	“There were a couple of soft-hit balls that led to the two runs in the first, but I thought Suarez settled in. His curveball was very pertinent, which is why he was able to pitch so deep into the game,” Angels manager Joe Maddon said.	UPTON, GOSSELIN DELIVER	Upton put the Angels on the board in the first game with a two-run single in the third. After the Blue Jays pulled to 4-3 in the fifth, Gosselin provided some insurance with a two-run single in the sixth.	Los Angeles right-hander Chris Rodriguez allowed only one run over four innings in his first career start at Angel Stadium.	Junior Guerra (3-2) got the win with a scoreless sixth, and Raisel Iglesias retired the side in the seventh for his 25th save.	Marcus Semien had three hits, including an RBI double in the third, for the Blue Jays.	Steven Matz (9-7) went 4 1/3 innings for Toronto. He was charged with four runs (two earned) and six hits. The left-hander struck out five and walked three.	TRAVELING HOME SHOW	Toronto joined the 1898 Cleveland Spiders and 1902 Cleveland Bronchos as the only big league teams to be the home team in four different ballparks during one season. However, the Blue Jays are the first team to play home games in four different states or provinces in the same season.	Although the Blue Jays batted last in the opener, all statistics and records will count as Angels home and Toronto road totals. According to baseball rules, the home team is based on the venue in which the game takes place.	FAMILIER SPOT	The Angels, blanked for the ninth time this year, fell to 57-57. It is the 22nd time this season they have a .500 record.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: RHP Trent Thornton was recalled from Triple-A Buffalo as the 27th man for the doubleheader.	Angels: Rodriguez was the team's 27th man. ... RHP Griffin Canning will miss the rest of the season due to a lower back stress fracture.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays rookie RHP Alek Manoah (4-1, 2.58 ERA) faces Los Angeles for the first time in his career Wednesday. Angels RHP Dylan Bundy (2-8, 6.14) has allowed three earned runs over 10 2/3 innings in two starts since returning to the rotation July 29.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

SAN DIEGO -- — Austin Nola hit a go-ahead single in the seventh inning, lifting the San Diego Padres over Miami 6-5 Tuesday night and sending the Marlins to their fifth straight loss.	Nola had two hits and two RBI. He extended his hitting streak to a career-best nine games.	“To be able to get through one of these bullpen games is huge,” Nola said.	With the score tied 5-all and Adam Frazier on second base with two outs, Nola hit a sharp single to left field against Richard Bleier (2-2).	“The way Nola is swinging the bat, defensively, all those things, he is doing a great job,” Padres manager Jayce Tingler said. “The guys at the bottom of the order are doing a great job either getting on or driving in runs.”	Mark Melancon got the last out of the eighth, worked around a leadoff double in the ninth and notched his MLB-leading 34th save.	Pierce Johnson (3-2) got the win in relief.	“We continue to play just solid, really good baseball. Each night it has been a little bit different,” Tingler said of San Diego's four-game winning streak. “We got down early but we answered back in the first couple of innings and got right back in the game.”	The Marlins, still missing manager Don Mattingly after he tested positive for COVID-19, have dropped six straight on the road.	The Padres started middle reliever Craig Stammen in a game that would feature eight San Diego pitchers.	“I thought I made some good pitches,” Stammen said. “Unfortunately the first inning didn't go as I had planned it.”	Lewis Brinson hit an RBI single and Jorge Alfaro had a two-run double to put Miami ahead 3-0 in the first.	Jake Cronenworth and Nola hit RBI doubles in the bottom half off Braxton Garrett.	“Garrett has some really good stuff,” Nola said. “He is a really good pitcher.”	Miami tacked on a run in the second when Miguel Rojas singled home Magneuris Sierra, who led off with a double. Stammen lasted only two innings, giving up four runs and six hits.	San Diego scored twice in the fourth for a 5-4 lead, chasing Garrett.	Rojas hit an RBI double in the seventh that made it 5-all.	HOT HOSMER	Eric Hosmer had two hits and is 23 for 54 (.426) at Petco Park since the beginning of July. That's the highest batting average in the majors at home since July 1 for players with at least 50 plate appearances.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Marlins: RHP Elieser Hernandez (right quad strain) threw 62 pitches over five innings in his third rehab start, second for Triple-A Jacksonville. He is expected back in mid-August. ... 2B Jazz Chisholm Jr. (flu-like symptoms) is headed back to Miami, according to acting manager James Rowson. Chisholm was scratched from the series finale against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday and did not make the trip to San Diego.	Padres: All-Star SS Fernando Tatis Jr. (partially separated left shoulder) was eligible to come off the IL on Tuesday but manager Jayce Tingler said the superstar is “still a ways away” and that there is no timeline. Tatis continues to do work in the outfield in anticipation of a position change when he comes back. “He’s progressing well, bouncing back well and able to do a little bit more each day,” Tingler said. ... RHP Dinelson Lamet (right forearm inflammation) threw 20 pitches and the next step will be another rehab assignment, another live bullpen session or “or be activated and go.”… Reliever Drew Pomeranz came out in the eighth inning with the trainer with forearm tightness. Tingler said Pomeranz will be day-to-day.	UP NEXT	Marlins: RHP Sandy Alcantara (6-10, 3.70) takes the hill in a Wednesday afternoon game.	Padres: LHP Ryan Weathers (4-4, 4.26) starts in the finale of the three-game series.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.
