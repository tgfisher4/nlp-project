TORONTO -- The Toronto Blue Jays couldn't get anything going against Baltimore's relievers for six full innings. But when Kevin Gregg came on to wrap up the save, the Orioles' bullpen didn't just bend, it broke.	Pinch-hitter J.P. Arencibia hit a game-winning single with two out in the ninth as the Blue Jays rallied to beat the Orioles 5-4 on Saturday, snapping Baltimore's winning streak at three games.	"We had a chance to win the game, we were one out, one pitch away," manager Buck Showalter said. "It's a frustrated clubhouse right now."	The blown save was Gregg's seventh in 27 chances, and he's failed in three of his past six opportunities.	"Every one of them is tough, no matter how it happens," Gregg said. "You don't like walking off the field like that."	Jose Bautista hit his major league-leading 41st home run, a two-run blast in the first, and Lawrie also went deep for the Blue Jays.	Jesse Litsch (6-3) pitched two innings for the win.	Trailing 4-3 to begin the inning, Toronto's David Cooper struck out against Clay Rapada before Showalter called Gregg (0-3) in to finish. Gregg struck out Brett Lawrie but couldn't wrap it up, walking Kelly Johnson, giving up a single to Jose Molina and hitting pinch-hitter Adam Loewen to load the bases. The closer then uncorked a wild pitch that allowed Johnson to score the tying run. Arencibia followed with a game-winning single to left.	"We got into a situation there where we didn't have much margin for error," Showalter said.	The collapse came after five Orioles relievers had combined to pitch six no-hit innings, allowing just one walk.	"The guys did an outstanding job," Gregg said. "The whole team put together a great effort and unfortunately I spoiled it at the end."	After Rick VandenHurk left in the third, rookie Zach Phillips pitched 1 2/3 innings, Chris Jakubauskas worked one inning, Troy Patton went 2 1/3, Willie Eyre got one out and Rapada got two outs.	"We were definitely aware of what was going on," Jakubauskas said. "We knew that the innings were stacking up, scoreless-wise. Each guy who goes in, you feed off the last guy."	The Orioles opened the scoring with three straight two-out singles in the first, matching the number of hits they collected in eight innings against Toronto right-hander Henderson Alvarez when he beat them at Baltimore on Aug. 31 for his first major league win. Nick Markakis and Vladimir Guerrero grounded singles to center before Chris Davis lined an RBI base hit to right.	The run snapped Alvarez's scoreless innings streak at 14.	Toronto answered in the bottom half when Bautista hammered a 3-2 pitch into the second deck in left, scoring shortstop Yunel Escobar ahead of him.	An error by Alvarez helped Baltimore tie it in the second. Kyle Hudson reached on a bunt single and moved to second when Alvarez's throw sailed into foul territory down the right field line. Pedro Florimon sacrificed Hudson to third and he scored on a two-out single by Matt Angle.	Toronto promptly reclaimed the lead when Lawrie homered to left on VandenHurk's first pitch of the bottom half, his ninth.	Baltimore tied it again with another two-out rally in the third. Guerrero singled to right and scored when Davis doubled up the alley in right-center. Josh Bell followed with a single to center but Davis ran through third base coach John Russell's stop sign and was thrown out at the plate for the third out.	Robert Andino doubled to begin the eighth against Litsch, took third on a grounder and scored when Guerrero doubled to center.	Guerrero went 3 for 4 and has eight hits in has past 13 at bats.	"Very quietly, he's finishing with a little flurry," Showalter said.	Making his first start of the season after two relief appearances, VandenHurk allowed three runs and three hits in 2 1/3 innings. He walked two and struck out one.	"I just didn't throw enough strikes," he said. "That's what it comes down to."	Alvarez allowed three runs and a season-high nine hits in seven innings. He walked one and struck out four.	Escobar left in the second after being hit on the left elbow by a pitch from VandenHurk. He was replaced by Mike McCoy. X-rays were negative and Escobar is day-to-day.	Game notes	 Orioles OF Adam Jones was scratched from the lineup with a sore left ankle. Jones fouled a ball of his ankle Friday night and it swelled up overnight, but Showalter said Jones might play Sunday. ... Florimon made his major league debut. ... Blue Jays OF prospect Melvin Garcia has been suspended 50 games for using a performance-enhancing substance. Garcia is the third Blue Jays minor leaguer to be suspended this season. RHP Aderly De La Cruz and LHP Luillyn Guillen received 50 games bans July 14.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

NEW YORK --  With first base open and the Cubs' best run producer at the plate in the ninth inning, Chicago manager Mike Quade was relieved to see the Mets pitch to Aramis Ramirez.	Ramirez came through, too, hitting a two-run single with two outs, lifting the Cubs to a 5-4 victory over New York after they blew a three-run lead in the eighth Saturday.	"These are the decisions you live and die with," Quade said. "The question doesn't get asked unless Rami gets a base hit, does it?"	Jason Bay had given the Mets a 4-3 lead in the eighth with a two-out, two-run single. But some more sloppy play by New York in the ninth on an overall rough day in the field and another meltdown by Bobby Parnell (3-6) helped the Cubs even a three-game series that will culminate with a ceremony Sunday to mark the 10-year anniversary of the terrorist attacks of 9/11. The Mets are offering free tickets to New York City first responders and their families for that game.	The Mets won the opener Friday night in the ninth after blowing a lead in the top half.	Afterward, workers painted the logo being used Sunday onto the Citi Field grass in foul territory, about 50 feet down the first- and third-base lines: a stars and stripes rendering of the MLB logo laying on top of red and blue ribbons, encircled by the saying "September 11, 2001. We shall not forget."	In the outfield, several dozen people constructed an enormous American flag out of red and white fabric strips. The blue and white stars section came in one piece that covered much of left field.	The Cubs built an early 2-0 lead with help from two errors by Jose Reyes in a dog of a game through seven innings on Bark in the Park day, a benefit for the North Shore Animal league. There were 332 dogs in attendance along with 30,443 people.	David Wright made his second error and New York's fourth of the game -- the team's most since Aug. 4, 2010 -- when he couldn't handle Geovany Soto's grounder leading off the ninth.	Pinch hitter Bryan LaHair doubled to put runners at second and third. Parnell then got two outs ahead of Ramirez. Collins considered walking Ramirez but he was thinking of his young closer.	"The one thing that enters my mind is I didn't want to put Bobby in that: He can't miss, I've got to throw that ball over the plate," Mets manager Terry Collins said.	Ramirez then lined an opposite-field single to right for the go-ahead runs. Parnell has been given an opportunity to earn the closer role for the Mets but he has blown five saves in 10 chances.	"I feel like I didn't give him anything good to hit," Parnell said. "I got a ground ball out of it. Unfortunately it was in the hole."	Kerry Wood (3-5) earned the win even though he gave up two runs in the eighth in relief of Randy Wells, who pitched neatly into the eighth inning.	Carlos Marmol gave up a one-out walk in the ninth but finished for his 34th save in 43 opportunities.	Trailing 3-0 in the eighth and having wasted several opportunities against Wells, the Mets scored four times after pinch hitter Willie Harris walked leading off, the third time they had the leadoff batter reach in four innings. Reyes followed with an RBI double to end Wells' day.	Wood entered and gave up a hit to Ruben Tejada and an RBI single to Wright after striking out Lucas Duda. Angel Pagan struck out and Wright stole second without a throw when the count was 0-2 to Bay.	Bay then lined a hit over leaping shortstop Starlin Castro for two runs, wasting another strong effort by Wells.	"All I care about is if the team wins," Wells said.	Most of the dogs were gone by the time the Mets mounted their eighth-inning rally to take a 4-3 lead.	Marlon Byrd had an RBI double in the eighth inning off Ryota Igarashi after Chris Capuano pitched seven impressive innings for New York to make it 3-0.	Reed Johnson doubled and scored in the first when Reyes jumped to catch Jeff Baker's sharp line drive right at him but dropped the ball. Johnson then added an RBI fielder's choice in the fifth a batter after Reyes fumbled Castro's grounder before he tried to make a throw to second for a forceout.	"It's no one person's fault that you lose a game," Wright said. "Collectively there's a lot of things we could have done to win this game."	Wells has not lost since July 28 when his ERA was 6.16. In eight starts since then, he has lowered it to 4.73. The right-hander didn't allow a baserunner until Mike Nickeas singled with one out in the third.	Capuano rebounded from his worst start of the year in which he gave up six runs in four innings against the Marlins on Monday with seven solid innings. He gave up five hits and two runs, striking out six.	Castro had two hits for Chicago to up his NL-leading total to 186.	Game notes	 Mets LHP Johan Santana will make another rehab start, either in the minors or in a simulated game in New York. Collins said "we have no plans to see him here" this season. ... Quade said the "medical people will decide what's best for" RHP Andrew Cashner, who was activated from the 60-day DL on Monday. Cashner (strained right rotator cuff) hasn't pitched in the majors since being injured on April 5, his only outing of the season. ... Cubs RHP Matt Garza (8-10) faces RHP Miguel Batista (4-2) on Sunday.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CHICAGO --  After faltering with the bases loaded all game, Alex Rios wouldn't let the Chicago White Sox come up empty again.	Rios hit a game-ending grand slam in the 10th inning to lift Chicago to a 7-3 win over the Cleveland Indians on Saturday.	Rios' one out, first-pitch shot off Chris Perez (3-7) was Chicago's first game-ending home run this season and his first career grand slam.	"I assumed he was going to come (inside)," Rios said. "I guess I got the pitch and put a good swing on it. It worked."	The blast came after the White Sox loaded the bases with one out for the fifth time in the game. In each of the first four occasions, Chicago didn't score, leaving the bases full.	The White Sox squandered bases-full situations in the first, sixth, eighth and ninth, and stranded 15 runners during the first nine innings before Rios snapped the streak in the 10th.	"Sometimes you get in stretches where you have a hard time scoring runs," Rios said. "I felt like we had one of those games today. We came through."	Rios, one of Chicago's highest-paid players, struck out with the bases full in the first inning and has struggled to a .222 average this season, making Saturday's triumph that much better.	"It was great," Rios said. "We battled through the whole game. It was a long game and to do that, it's good. Any time you get a win, it's good."	Chicago had plenty of baserunners all day, with 10 hits and a season-high 11 walks but went just 3 for 15 with runners in scoring position.	"That (summed up) the White Sox season right there," manager Ozzie Guillen said. "The only thing we did good is we won.	"I'm glad we won, but it was tough. When you see that over and over and over, what's going on? You missed a very interesting Sunday paper if we lose this game."	Alejandro De Aza doubled twice, walked and scored two runs for Chicago. Gordon Beckham had a double, two walks and two RBIs.	Sergio Santos (4-4) threw a scoreless inning to get the win in relief. Santos combined with Chris Sale to strike out six straight batters during the late innings.	Shelley Duncan doubled, homered and scored two runs for Cleveland. Matt LaPorta added a two-run double and Jim Thome singled twice.	Indians starter Fausto Carmona allowed six hits and three runs in 5 1/3 innings, lowering his ERA to 9.14 ERA in four starts against the White Sox this season.	Perez took the loss and wasn't too happy about the circumstances that led up to it, especially the walks.	"Very rarely you see major-league pitchers one through five have to struggle throwing strikes," Perez said. "We'll have our off-days here and there, but not our whole bullpen."	Chicago's Phil Humber was sharp in his six innings, holding Cleveland to two runs and striking out seven, but settled for a no-decision on Saturday after throwing just 73 pitches.	"That's not my call," Humber said of the timing of his removal. "Obviously you want to be out there, but at the same time (Guillen) has been around a long time. I'm never going to question the manager on that.	"I feel great. I feel like today was the best I've thrown in awhile."	The Indians went ahead on LaPorta's two-run double in the fifth, snapping Humber's streak of 13 1/3 scoreless innings. LaPorta was making his first start for the Indians since Aug. 29, the day before he was sent down to Triple-A Columbus.	Adam Dunn singled in the sixth, ending a string of 18 hitless at-bats, and started Chicago's rally. De Aza doubled off the center-field wall, sending Dunn to third and Carmona to the showers after 103 pitches.	Chad Durbin replaced Carmona and walked Brent Morel and Beckham, forcing in Dunn with the tying run. Juan Pierre singled in De Aza, giving Chicago a 3-2 lead.	Duncan greeted reliever Jesse Crain with a homer to left-center in the seventh, tying the score 3-all. Duncan has with five homers and 10 RBIs in seven games over the last week.	But the hero was Rios, not a title he's been able to claim often this season.	"If you win it in that fashion, it makes it a little more fun," Rios said. "Every time you get a win, it's important."	Game notes	 First base umpire Ed Rapuano had to leave the game in the fourth inning because of sore neck. ... Indians RHP Josh Tomlin (elbow) is doing "very well" with his throwing program and the team is leaning toward not shutting him down, manager Manny Acta said. ... DH Travis Hafner (foot) ran the bases on Saturday but Acta said there is still no timetable on his return. 3B Jack Hannahan (calf strain) will rejoin the Indians in Texas, though Acta is not sure when he'll return to game action. ... The Indians will send Ubaldo Jimenez to the mound for Sunday's series finale against Chicago rookie Zach Stewart. Jimenez is 2-1 with a 5.56 ERA since he was acquired from Colorado on July 31. Stewart is coming off a one-hit shutout of Minnesota on Sept. 5 in which he carried a perfect game into the eighth inning.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

DETROIT --  Brandon Inge might be struggling through the worst season of his 11-year career, but he does have a flair for the dramatic.	Saturday, Inge hit his second game-ending homer of the season, giving the Detroit Tigers a 3-2 victory over the Minnesota Twins on Saturday night. His only other homer this season came in his first at-bat with the Tigers after an month-long exile to Triple-A Toledo.	"I love situations like that, where you know that if you get the right result, it is going to be spectacular, especially with these fans in Detroit," Inge said. "But trust me, if I could do that on command, I wouldn't be hitting .194."	With two out in the bottom of the ninth, Inge hit a 2-1 pitch into the left-field stands off Glen Perkins (4-4) to give Detroit its eighth straight victory. He also hit a game-ending homer on April 13 against Texas' Darren Oliver.	"I was just looking for something up in the zone that I could drive," he said. "Ever since I've gotten back from Toledo, my swing might look a little weird, but I'm just trying to hit everything hard. As soon as I got that one, I knew it was gone. That's a great feeling."	Perkins thought his pitch selection was his biggest mistake.	"I should have thrown him another slider," he said. "Drew (Butera) called for a fastball, but I should have shaken him off. The pitch I threw him was the only one he could have hit out."	Al Alburquerque (6-1) picked up the victory with a perfect ninth inning, but sustained an injury to his upper right leg.	"He said it was nothing, but I told him that this isn't the time of year to be a hero," said Tigers manager Jim Leyland. "He looked okay, so we left him in, but I'm not sure what the injury is -- he's being looked at right now."	The win lowered Detroit's magic number for clinching the AL Central to nine over Chicago and eight over Cleveland.	"Everyone here that was here in 2009 -- and that's most of us -- learned our lesson that year," Inge said. "If we could have found a way to win one more game in that season, we would have never had to play Game 163 in Minnesota. This year, we want to take care of business as quickly as possible."	Neither starting pitcher was involved in the decision. Detroit's Max Scherzer allowed two runs on five hits in seven innings, while Anthony Swarzak gave up a pair of runs on four hits in six innings.	"That was a battle, because I didn't have any command on my fastball," Scherzer said. "They got a couple off me, but I made a few big pitches and I got some big help from my defense."	The Tigers took a third-inning lead on Wilson Betemit's seventh homer, but the Twins tied it 1-1 in the fourth on Joe Mauer's third home run of the season.	Detroit went back in front in the fourth when Andy Dirks led off with a double, took third on Miguel Cabrera's one-out groundout and scored on Victor Martinez's RBI single.	Scherzer held the one-run lead until the sixth, when Trevor Plouffe drew a walk, moved to third on Mauer's base hit. Austin Jackson then made a spectacular leaping catch of Danny Valencia's drive to deep center, but Plouffe easily scored from third on the play.	"It was a well-pitched game on both sides," Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said. "We just didn't execute a few times when we needed it."	Game notes	 The game, which drew 38,567 fans, was Star Wars Night at Comerica Park. Before the game, with numerous costumed characters on the field, Plouffe came out of the Minnesota dugout and rubbed his bat on Darth Vader's helmet. The apparent attempt at good luck didn't work though, as Plouffe struck out in his first two at-bats. ... The teams complete the series on Sunday afternoon with Doug Fister (7-13) pitching for the Tigers against Minnesota's Scott Diamond (1-3). ... Inge had only entered the game in the eighth inning as a defensive replacement for Betemit.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  The lengthy dry spell against the Texas Rangers is finally over for the Oakland Athletics, thanks to Scott Sizemore.	Sizemore's grand slam in the sixth inning helped the A's end a nine-game skid against Texas with an 8-7 victory over the AL West-leading Rangers on Saturday.	Manager Bob Melvin was tired of losing to the A's division rival, and he let the players know how he felt following Friday night's 13-4 defeat to Texas.	"These guys kind of had our number," Sizemore said. "Skip (Melvin) let us know (Friday) night that we had to put that behind us and come out (Saturday)."	With the score tied at 3, Rangers starter Alexi Ogando (12-8) hit Josh Willingham with a pitch leading off the sixth, and David DeJesus followed with a single. Texas manager Ron Washington replaced Ogando with left-hander Mike Gonzalez.	Ryan Sweeney attempted to bunt, and Gonzalez made a nice play to get a force at third. After Brandon Allen was retired on a foul popup, Gonzalez walked Kurt Suzuki to load the bases, and Washington again went to his bullpen and brought in Yoshinori Tateyama.	Sizemore was sent in by manager Bob Melvin to hit for Eric Sogard, and Sizemore ripped Tateyama's high 1-0 fastball into the left field seats for his first career grand slam and a 7-3 lead.	Cliff Pennington added an RBI double off Tateyama later in the sixth to give the A's a five-run cushion.	Sizemore had his second career pinch homer, but a defensive play he made in the ninth at third base nearly matched his deep drive with the bases loaded. Sizemore leaned into the Oakland dugout to catch Ian Kinsler's foul popup leading off the ninth, with catcher Suzuki grabbing Sizemore by the belt to make sure his teammate didn't tumble into the dugout.	Asked to compare the two plays, Sizemore smiled and said, "I've got to say the grand slam. You don't hit too many pinch-hit grand slams."	Tateyama also allowed a grand slam to Boston's Carl Crawford last Saturday at Boston, the final batter he faced in that game. For the first time in Rangers history, a pitcher gave up grand slams to consecutive hitters.	According to research provided to the Rangers by Elias Sports Bureau, the last pitcher to allow grand slams to consecutive batters faced was Greg McCarthy of Seattle in 1998.	In his last five outings, Tateyama has been knocked around for 12 runs and 11 hits and four homers in four innings.	"The location is not there," the Japanese right-hander said through a translator.	Adrian Beltre's 299th career homer -- a two-run shot in the sixth off starter Trevor Cahill (11-13) -- pulled Texas within 8-5. Michael Young's two-run single in the seventh off Fautino De Los Santos made it 8-7.	Beltre, who had three hits to extend his hitting streak to 15 games, was the final batter for Cahill, who gave up five runs and seven hits over five-plus innings.	Andrew Bailey pitched the ninth for his 20th save in 22 chances, but it wasn't easy. Josh Hamilton drew a two-out walk, and Michael Young reached on an infield single, but Beltre lined out to second baseman Adam Rosales to end the game.	Hamilton hit a two-run game-winning homer off Bailey on July 9 and was 3 for 3 for his career against the A's closer. So Bailey wasn't going to give the slugger anything he could knock out of the ballpark.	"Obviously, everyone knows he hit the walk-off against me," Bailey said. "I wasn't trying to stay away from him or walk him, but I knew I had to be careful."	Ogando gave up five runs -- three earned -- and six hits in five-plus innings in his first for the Rangers since Aug. 31. His previously scheduled start was skipped to allow him additional rest.	Ogando had gone 7-0 in his first 12 starts but the converted reliever has struggled with his command and has dropped five of his last seven decisions.	"He kept us in the ball game," Washington said. "He's coming back. I felt like he did what he had to do."	Willingham led off the second with a line drive single up the middle that Ogando had to duck to avoid. DeJesus bunted, and catcher Yorvit Torrealba threw wildly to first for an error that allowed the runners to advance to second and third.	Sweeney followed with a two-run triple into the right field corner, and Suzuki added a sacrifice fly later in the inning for a 3-0 pad.	The Rangers got a run in the third when Ian Kinsler scored from third on Cahill's wild pitch, and Mitch Moreland's two-run double in the fourth pulled Texas even at 3.	Game notes	 Rangers OF Nelson Cruz ran the bases for a second straight day as he rehabs from a strained left hamstring that put him on the 15-day DL on Aug. 30. The plan is for Cruz to take Sunday off from running on the field, then reevaluate his condition early next week. ... Hamilton was back in the lineup after missing Friday night's game to be with his wife for the birth of their fourth daughter. ... Oakland LHP Josh Outman gets a spot start on Sunday, replacing RHP Rich Harden. Outman will be making his ninth start of the season but his first since July 2. Outman struck out seven Boston hitters in a four-inning relief stint Aug. 27, but has pitched only 2 1/3 innings in two appearances since then. ... Harden won't start again until Wednesday night for extra rest. Rangers ace C.J. Wilson, a 15-game winner, takes the mound for Texas. ... OF Coco Crisp missed Saturday's game and has been ruled out for Sunday due to injuries to his ankle and foot.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

DENVER --  Jordan Pacheco was on his way out of the Colorado clubhouse with the ball he hit for his first home run in his pocket, a keepsake for his father after helping the Rockies beat the Cincinnati Reds 12-7 on Saturday.	The home run broke a fifth-inning tie, and Pacheco's two-run single capped a four-run eighth in a game in which the teams combined for nine home runs in the first five innings.	The Reds hit five homers off starter Alex White, who tied a Rockies record for homers allowed in a game. White (2-1) gave up three homers in succession. He has allowed 12 homers in 37 innings in four starts with the Rockies and has a 6.32 ERA.	"It's really embarrassing, to be honest," White said. "I'm pretty bad right now. It's amazing that I still get the win there, because I certainly don't deserve it. The team picked me up, and I got out of there with it still tied."	White, acquired in the July 31 trade that sent pitcher Ubaldo Jimenez to the Cleveland Indians, lasted five innings in his second start at Coors Field. Staked to a 6-1 lead after two innings, White gave up a solo homer to Chris Heisey in the third and a two-run shot to Juan Francisco after walking Jay Bruce with two out.	The Reds teed off on White with one out in the fifth, when Heisey, Joey Votto and Jay Bruce hit successive home runs in a nine-pitch sequence that tied the game at 7. White, 23, regrouped and got two fly ball outs to finish an outing that included just four outs on ground balls -- two in the first inning.	"I didn't see him back off (after the three consecutive home runs)," Rockies manager Jim Tracy said. "And that is very, very encouraging to see. He put the inning down. The game was tied. It was only the fifth inning, and you're going to use a lot of bullpen, but he hung right in there."	Tracy said White's pitches basically stayed on the same plane, even his slider, as the ball entered the hitting area. Before the trade to the Rockies, White, who missed more than two months because of a torn tendon in his right middle finger, made his seventh major league start.	"My finger feels good," White said. "I don't think that has anything to do with it. My arm felt good, body feels good. I think it's really just consistency with my delivery, consistency with my location and sometimes maybe a little too much effort and I lose my spot on certain pitches and they get hit. That's just something I can't do at this level."	Pacheco, playing in his fourth game in the big leagues, got into a 3-1 count against Matt Maloney (0-2) and homered over the center field fence. His two-run single in the eighth came with two out against Jeremy Horst. Pacheco has five hits in his first 14 at-bats, for a .357 average, with one homer and five RBI -- including two two-RBI games.	"I don't have any different feel about this kid than I had in spring training," Tracy said. "This is a very, very solid offensive player with a real good idea of the strike zone and a nice chip for us moving forward."	The Rockies hit three homers in the first two innings, knocking out Bronson Arroyo and giving him a share of a dubious Reds record. Arroyo has allowed 40 home runs, tying Eric Milton for the team's single-season mark set in 2005.	Mark Ellis began a four-run barrage in the first with a homer, his fifth since joining the Rockies and fourth at Coors Field. Carlos Gonzalez lined a double off the out-of-town scoreboard in right field. Troy Tulowitzki, back in the lineup after left hip soreness kept him out Friday, singled home Gonzalez.	Jason Giambi hit a two-run homer to straightaway center field for his 13th shot of the season and No. 428 overall. He moved past Mike Piazza and into 42nd place on baseball's career list.	White led off the second with his first major league hit, a double that went over the head of right fielder Jay Bruce, who was fighting the sun. Dexter Fowler followed with his fifth home run, a drive that hit off the facing of the second deck in right field and finished Arroyo's day.	"Looked like he was getting balls over the heart of the plate and up," Reds manager Dusty Baker said. "That doesn't favor well in this ballpark. He hung a couple breaking balls, a couple of fastballs were centered. Balls missed location. That's all it takes here. Same thing happened to White on their side."	Arroyo tied his career low with one inning, something he also did in 2008 and 2009. He is 0-2 at Coors Field with an 8.84 ERA in 10 games, including eight starts, but didn't blame his troubles on the altitude.	"Their guys got to (deal with) the same thing," Arroyo said. "It's not like it's an unfair fight. I don't think you can get accustomed to that. The air isn't going to change. I've had a difficult time with this lineup over the years, especially at this ballpark. I don't see them a whole lot. It's hard to have a concrete game plan. You're unsure of guys' mental processes at the plate, to be able to pick them apart."	Matt Belisle, Rex Brothers, Huston Street and Rafael Betancourt followed White to the mound and combined to allow one hit over the final four innings. Betancourt's appearance was a non-save situation after Pacheco delivered his two-run single, offensive icing for him after a home run that went an estimated 422 feet.	"I got into a couple good counts, so I was able to let the bat fly a little bit." Pacheco said. "I'm just trying to stay inside the ball and look up the middle (and) the other way. I wasn't trying to do too much. Late in the game, you pray for every run you can get. We were able to push across four, so that was nice."	Game notes	 White is the third Rockies pitcher to allow five home runs in a game but the first to do it after the 2002 installation of the humidor at Coors Field. ... Rockies 2B Mark Ellis left the game in the sixth after getting hit in the head by a pitch from Carlos Fisher. Ellis sat up right away after being hit and walked off the field unaided. ... The last time the Reds hit three consecutive homers was Aug. 13, 2006, at Philadelphia when Juan Encarnacion, Adam Dunn and Rich Aurilia did it. ... Heisey has had three two-homer games in his career, all this season. ... Left-hander Drew Pomeranz will make his major league debut and start for the Rockies on Sunday. Edinson Volquez, 5-4 with a 5.93 ERA, will make his first start for the Reds since July 5. He went 3-2 with a 2.47 ERA in 11 starts at Triple-A Louisville after being sent down.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

WASHINGTON --  Jason Bourgeois and the Houston Astros haven't had a lot of moments to celebrate this season, so an easy win behind a big offensive inning gave them a much-needed lift.	The Astros strung together six consecutive hits during a six-run third inning, starter Wandy Rodriguez earned his 11th win, and almost everything went right for Houston in a 9-3 victory over the Washington Nationals on Saturday night.	"It's great to come out and kind of dominate for once," said Bourgeois, who had three hits and an RBI.	The Astros' six runs and seven hits in the third inning both tied the team's single-inning highs this season, and the 16 overall hits also tied their season best.	Carlos Corporan drove in three runs. Five Astros had at least two hits. Carlos Lee had a double, single and drove in a run, giving him 80 RBIs for the 13th straight season, second only to Alex Rodriguez among active players.	Houston has by far the worst record in the majors this season, and had lost six of seven entering the game. The Astros' next loss will tie the franchise-worst mark of 97, but the rare win boosted their spirits.	"It feels great," Corporan said. "This year we haven't played like our record shows. We've been playing hard, playing close games, a lot of extra innings. That's good when one comes along and everything goes right, and you feel good. You just try to keep the moment and keep winning."	Rodriguez (11-10) went six innings, giving up three runs and seven hits and striking out seven. Rodriguez is the only Astros' starter with a winning record.	"You could see his confidence out there," Houston manager Brad Mills said.	Nothing went right for Washington starter John Lannan (9-12). He gave up six runs -- four earned -- and eight hits in 2 1/3 innings, his second-shortest outing this season. He allowed six hits and seven runs in two innings at Philadelphia on May 5.	Lannan also made a costly error in the middle of Houston's big inning, which started when Jordan Schafer doubled down the left field line with one out and took third as Michael Morse misplayed the ball. Each of Houston's next five batters singled, including run-scoring hits by Bourgeois, Lee and Chris Johnson.	After the six straight hits, the bases were loaded and Jose Altuve hit a dribbler toward third base. Lannan fielded the ball but his throw home was wide of catcher Jesus Flores. Lannan dropped to his knees and held his head in his hands as two runs scored.	The play left runners on the corners for Corporan, whose squeeze bunt got past Lannan for an RBI single, giving Houston a 6-0 lead and ending the pitcher's night.	"The third inning killed me," Lannan said. "It's one of those days where I didn't get the job done, and it's unacceptable."	The Astros added two more runs in the fifth inning on a sacrifice fly by Corporan and a run-scoring double by Rodriguez, his first extra-base hit of the season. Corporan also had an RBI single in the ninth.	"I think it helps everybody," Mills said. "Not just the young guys, it helps everybody. These types of games might have not been real close together, but at the same time these guys come out every day and they bust their tail and get after it, and it's nice to see them do that even when it's been real tough."	Morse hit his team-leading 27th home run, a solo shot in the sixth inning, and Chris Marrero hit a two-run single in the fourth.	Game notes	 RHP Stephen Strasburg will make his second start for the Nationals on Sunday since returning from last year's Tommy John surgery. Washington manager Davey Johnson said he didn't have a strict innings or pitch-count limit for his young star. "I'm just going to go by what I see. I don't have a set number. I'm going to see how he's going along. I'm not going to let him struggle or anything like that," Johnson said. ... The Nationals named INF Steve Lombardozzi and RHP Brad Peacock minor league player and pitcher of the year. Both are now with Washington. Johnson said Peacock would likely get his first major league start during the team's four-game series at the New York Mets starting Monday. ... RHP Lance Pendleton was activated by Houston, a day after he was claimed off waivers from the New York Yankees. ... LHP Sergio Escalona, who sprained his left ankle on Friday, will be placed on the 60-day disabled list on Sunday when the Astros will purchase the contract of LHP Xavier Cedeon from Triple-A Oklahoma City. ... RHP Henry Sosa (2-3) will start for the Astros on Sunday.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

PITTSBURGH --  Anibal Sanchez has been working on avoiding trouble in the first inning since the All-Star break.	He had very little trouble in any inning against the Pittsburgh Pirates.	Sanchez pitched his second one-hitter of the season and tied his career high with 11 strikeouts to win for just the second time in his last 16 starts as the Marlins beat the Pirates 3-0 on Saturday night.	"I need to find a way to start off better and go deeper in games," the right-hander said.	Sanchez did both.	"He was in complete control," Florida manager Jack McKeon said.	Sanchez also threw a one-hitter against Colorado on April 22, giving up a leadoff single in the ninth to Dexter Fowler.	The only thing that stood between Sanchez (8-7) and the second no-hitter of his six-year career was Neil Walker's one-out single to left field in the second inning. Pittsburgh loaded the bases, but Sanchez struck out losing pitcher Jeff Locke to end the threat. That put him on his way to the fourth shutout and sixth complete game of his career.	Sanchez, who threw a no-hitter on Sept. 6, 2006, against Arizona at Miami, retired the final 16 hitters after walking Ryan Ludwick in the fourth. Sanchez is 2-6 with a 4.17 ERA in his last 16 starts after going 6-1 with a 3.06 ERA in his first 13.	Sanchez also struck out 11 on May 8 against Washington. He walked three.	"He was getting ahead of guys with his fastball and slider, and his secondary pitchers were there whether he was ahead or behind in the count," Marlins catcher John Buck said. "When he has that downward angle on his changeup like he did tonight, it makes it tough on either lefties or righties."	Sanchez's change was so good that even home umpire Dan Iassogna was talking about it.	"He said a couple of times how nasty they were," Buck said. "And they were because the bottom was falling out of them."	Walker's hit was a clean double down the left-field line.	"I wanted to throw the ball away because he doesn't usually hit the ball the other way on the line," Sanchez said. "I made the right pitch. He just hit it. There's nothing you can do. Something else might have happened after that to break up the no-hitter anyway. I was just happy I was able to finish the game."	Pirates manager Clint Hurdle, whose club has a major league-high 484 strikeouts since the All-Star break, was impressed by Sanchez.	"He really never allowed us to get into position to get many hits because he was getting ahead in the count, mixing his pitches and showing no pattern with his pitches," Hurdle said. "He had command of all four of his pitches."	Locke (0-1) took the loss in his major league debut, allowing three runs and five hits in five innings. He walked four and struck out one.	"It was a great experience and a lot of fun. The biggest thing I learned from it is that you've got make pitches and get ahead in the count, especially against these guys in the big leagues," Locke said. "My command wasn't altogether there and I'd say it was because of some nervousness, some anxiousness and having a little too much adrenaline flowing."	Florida scored all the runs in the third off Locke. Buck highlighted the inning with a two-run single.	Rookie Matt Dominguez had three hits, and Emilio Bonifacio added two for the Marlins, who are 5-0 against the Pirates this season.	Locke, 23, was recalled Tuesday from Triple-A Indianapolis, where he went 1-2 with a 2.22 ERA in five starts. He spent the majority of the season at Double-A Altoona, going 7-8 with a 4.03 ERA in 23 games, 22 starts.	The Marlins were without center fielder Mike Cameron and right fielder Mike Stanton, who both had strained right hamstrings, and left fielder Logan Morrison, who bruised his left knee while making a sliding catch and crashing into a side wall on Friday night.	Stanton was reinjured Friday after sitting out four games. Cameron missed his third consecutive game.	Locke put himself in trouble in the third with control problems.	Bonifacio led off with an infield single, Bryan Petersen walked, and the runners moved up to second and third on Omar Infante's sacrifice bunt. Locke then walked Gaby Sanchez to load the bases, and Buck followed by lining a two-run single to right field before Donnie Murphy capped the inning with a sacrifice fly.	"We had a skeleton crew but if (Sanchez) pitches like that all the time we won't ever need any runs," McKeon said.	Game notes	 A day after Stanton disputed that he was hurt after being pulled in the third inning, McKeon said he wouldn't play the slugger again until he was "100 percent healthy." ... Morrison is likely to return to the lineup Monday night when the Marlins open a three-game series at Atlanta. ... Locke became the 51st player used by the Pirates this season, tying the club record set last year. ... Pittsburgh RHP Chris Leroux pitched two scoreless relief innings but had his streak of consecutive batters retired end at 20 when Bonifacio singled in the seventh. ... RHP Javier Vazquez (9-11, 4.29) will start for Florida against RHP James McDonald (9-7, 3.98) on Sunday in the finale of the three-game series. Vazquez has won his last two starts, allowing only one run in 14 innings. McDonald has a 3.26 ERA in 10 starts since the All-Star break.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

MILWAUKEE --  Raul Ibanez reached second after a small bobble. Carlos Ruiz laid down a crucial bunt. It is the little things that the Philadelphia Phillies keep excelling at as they run away with the National League.	Ibanez doubled and scored on LaTroy Hawkins' throwing error in the 10th, and the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Milwaukee Brewers 3-2 on Saturday night for their sixth straight win.	"It worked out well for us," Ibanez said. "This team is always trying to find a way to win, however that is, sometimes it's not exactly how you plan it, but it works out."	The NL East-leading Phillies are on pace for their best season in franchise history and could clinch a playoff berth on Sunday with a win and a loss by St. Louis. Philadelphia can complete a four-game sweep against Milwaukee on Sunday.	"Hopefully we do," Phillies starter Cliff Lee said. "It's not like we felt like we had to come in here and sweep them to make a statement, it's just playing the way we play and it's kind of the way it's turned out."	Hunter Pence and Placido Polanco homered for the Phillies, who are 12 games ahead of Atlanta in the division race.	"I'm happy with that number," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said. "That's what we play for. If we could be 20 up, we would be."	Casey McGehee scored a run in a plate collision with Ruiz and drove in another off Lee to end his scoreless innings streak at 30 2-3.	But Milwaukee lost its fifth straight as its NL Central lead dropped to six games with the Cardinals' 4-3 win over the Braves.	In the 10th, Ibanez led off with a double against Hawkins (1-1) after right fielder Corey Hart bobbled the ball just a little, allowing him to reach second.	Ibanez scored when Ruiz laid down a bunt, and Hawkins took a bad angle, thinking McGehee would field the ball from third. He then fired well over Prince Fielder's head at first for an error.	"I think he thought Casey was going to get it. Casey thought he was going to get it," Brewers manager Ron Roenicke said. "That's a bunt that's in between the spot where Casey thinks the pitcher is going to get, we have a shot at third, which he did. It's a judgment play."	Michael Stutes (6-1) pitched the ninth for the victory, and Ryan Madson converted his 30th save.	Madson walked Hart to start the inning, and Hart reached second on Craig Counsell's bunt. Ryan Braun struck out and Fielder was intentionally walked for McGehee, who grounded out.	Philadelphia has dominated two of the other three NL playoff contenders over the last six games, also sweeping Atlanta.	"When you get into October, it's a completely new season," Ibanez said. "You try not to look into it or buy into it too much. You just feel good about the day, and tomorrow's a new game."	The Brewers, meanwhile, have their smallest division lead since Aug. 14.	"They're down. I'm down," Roenicke said. "It's a tough loss. This was a hard one to lose. There were a lot of positives things. That's why it's disappointing to lose."	McGehee reached second on a throwing error before his vicious forearm blow tied it in the second inning. Yuniesky Betancourt singled and Ruiz got center fielder Shane Victorino's throw in plenty of time and had the plate blocked well.	But McGehee lowered his body and slammed his forearms into the catcher's mask to jar the ball free, then popped up and let out an emotional scream with both fists clinched tightly for a team that's sputtering at the wrong time.	"If I was the runner, I would've done the same thing," said Ruiz, who joked that it felt good. "He asked me next at-bat, 'Are you OK?' And I said, 'Yes, thank you for asking me.' It's a part of the game."	McGehee's RBI groundout in the fourth made it 2-1, but Polanco and the Phillies answered.	Polanco's homer just over the left field wall off Brewers starter Randy Wolf in the fifth was his first since June 10, and Lee escaped major trouble in the seventh to end his night.	Carlos Gomez singled with one out and stole second. Pinch hitter Rickie Weeks, playing for the first time since July 27, walked and left for a pinch runner. But Milwaukee failed to score after Jonathan Lucroy and Hart hit deep fly balls to end the inning.	With the one earned run, Lee's ERA rose to 0.48 over 56 2/3 innings since the start of August. He failed to win a start for the first time since July 25.	Phillies slugger Ryan Howard (heel) was given an extra day out of the starting lineup, but entered as a pinch hitter in the eighth and struck out. Shortstop Jimmy Rollins (groin) pinch hit in the 10th and grounded out, marking his first appearance in a game since Aug. 21 after he was activated on Thursday.	"It's a credit to the depth we've got," Lee said. "Our pitching's been pretty good this series and we've got guys that can fill those spots pretty well."	Game notes	 Pence homered in the first. ... Phillies 2B Chase Utley (concussion) will be re-evaluated next week. The Phillies say it's unlikely he'll join the team in Houston, but his recovery has been very positive so far and they're being cautious. ... Weeks (left ankle) played in a simulated game beforehand and pinch hit in the seventh. ... The Brewers called up RHP Mike Fiers and had him pitch in a simulated game to Weeks. Fiers is expected to be available out of the bullpen on Tuesday. ... Sunday's finale features Brewers RHP Yovani Gallardo (15-10, 3.71 ERA) against Phillies RHP Vance Worley (11-1, 2.85).	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  The Tampa Bay Rays are making the AL playoff race very interesting.	Evan Longoria hit an RBI single in the bottom of the 11th inning, helping the Rays rebound after blowing a ninth-inning lead to beat the Boston Red Sox 6-5 on Saturday night and pull within 4½ games of the AL wild-card leaders.	"We all believe we have a solid chance to do this," Rays manager Joe Maddon said.	Desmond Jennings opened the 11th with a triple off Daniel Bard (2-7) that lunging center fielder Jacoby Ellsbury couldn't reach. After B.J. Upton hit a grounder to first, Longoria lined a single to center on an 0-2 pitch.	"We got there at the same time and I heard (Ellsbury) call the ball," Red Sox right fielder Darnell McDonald said about Jennings' triple. "Tried to get out of the way ... The ball dropped. That's about how it's going for us right now."	Brandon Gomes (2-1) worked 1 1/3 perfect innings for the Rays.	Jarrod Saltalamacchia and Ellsbury hit consecutive one-out solo homers in the ninth off closer Kyle Farnsworth to pull the Red Sox even at 5.	"It's disapppointing the way it ended, but we sure gave ourselves a chance," Boston manager Terry Francona said.	After Dustin Pedroia doubled and Adrian Gonzalez walked, Cesar Ramos replaced Farnsworth and induced a double-play grounder from David Ortiz.	Farnsworth has blown six saves in 29 opportunities this season, including two straight outings. After the game, Maddon said Farnsworth tweaked his right elbow and will shut down for at least a few days.	Gonzalez hit his 25th homer for the Red Sox, who have lost six of seven. Ellsbury has a 15-game hitting streak.	Boston left-hander Jon Lester (15-6) and Rays right-hander James Shields (14-10) are the scheduled starters in Sunday's series finale. Shields has 11 complete games this season, the most in the majors.	"It should be a pretty good matchup," Francona said.	The teams begin a four-game series Thursday night at Fenway Park.	"We've got to stay very hot," Maddon said. "I think we're committed to this."	The Rays have won 20 games in a row when scoring five or more runs, and moved a season-high 16 games over .500 (80-64).	"That was a really good gut check for us, to be able to hang in that game and pick up a must-win," Longoria said. "These are the games we're going to have to win if we're going to make the playoffs."	Tampa Bay went ahead 4-3 when Casey Kotchman hit a solo homer against reliever Alfredo Aceves during the fifth. It was Kotchman's first homer since Aug. 12 off Yankees ace CC Sabathia.	Longoria made it 5-3 with a sacrifice fly in the sixth. He has driven in 63 runs over his past 71 games.	Gonzalez hit a two-run shot during the fifth that got Boston even at 3. Gonzalez had just seven hits, including one homer and two RBIs, in his previous 45 at-bat against the Rays this season.	Jennings drove in a run on a grounder during the second, and Kotchman gave the Rays 3-1 lead on a bases-loaded sacrifice fly one inning later.	Tampa Bay loaded the bases on two walks and a single with no outs in the first, but scored just once on Ben Zobrist's grounder. Kyle Weiland avoided further damage by striking out Johnny Damon and getting a fly ball from Matt Joyce.	The Rays went 0-for-8 with runners in scoring position against Weiland, who allowed three runs, six hits and three walks over four innings.	Boston tied it at 1 on Jed Lowrie's second-inning RBI grounder.	Tampa Bay rookie Jeremy Hellickson allowed three runs and five hits in six innings.	Game notes	 Red Sox INF Kevin Youkilis (left hip) will be out until at least Tuesday. ... Rays SS Sean Rodriguez set a club record when he was hit by a pitch for the 15th time this season in the sixth by Aceves. ... Boston RHP Josh Beckett (sprained right ankle) threw long toss and at 60 feet on level ground, and could soon be ready to throw off a bullpen mound. ... The Rays plan to purchase the contract of UTL Russ Canzler and recall RHP Dane De La Rosa from Triple-A Durham on Sunday.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ST. LOUIS --  There's fight left in the St. Louis Cardinals. The team they are chasing for the NL wild card saw it again.	Lance Berkman had a single, RBI double and walk -- reaching base seven straight times over two games -- helping the Cardinals inch closer in the wild card race with their second straight 4-3 victory over the Atlanta Braves on Saturday night.	"It's not like we're playing for a World Series championship right now but we're on the fringes of contention," Berkman said. "You kind of feel that and it gives you a little extra concentration."	Jaime Garcia (12-7) worked six efficient innings, and Rafael Furcal had two hits and his 300th career steal for the Cardinals, who doubled four times and scored four runs in the first three innings against Derek Lowe (9-14). They've taken the first two games of the three-game series, to reduce Atlanta's wild card lead to 5 1/2 games and pull St. Louis within six games of first-place Milwaukee in the NL Central.	With only 17 games to go, they need a sweep to keep the surge going.	"I don't think you can look too far down the road," Berkman said. "If we come out and lay an egg (Sunday), then the series doesn't mean a whole lot because we really haven't gained that much ground.	"If we can somehow win the game tomorrow, then it gets really interesting."	For the Braves, it's no time to panic.	"No, no, no, no," Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "Let's try to get back into winning ways tomorrow, starting tomorrow, and rattle off seven, eight, nine in a row."	Freddie Freeman hit his 19th home run for the Braves, who are 4-7 in September after going 17-9 in August. Michael Bourn singled twice, for a two-day total of six hits, and had a steal but he flied out with the tying run on third for the final out.	"I was going to battle to the end," Bourn said. "He won that battle. We'll be back tomorrow."	Garcia has won his first two starts this month after going 0-2 with a 6.84 ERA in August. He allowed three runs and eight hits with four strikeouts and no walks.	"I really thought maybe the first inning or two were as good as he's thrown this year," Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said. "Then he got a couple of balls in the middle and they've got good hitters."	Jason Heyward walked with one out in the ninth, then stole second and went to third on catcher Yadier Molina's throwing error with two outs before Jason Motte wrapped up his fourth save in seven chances. Motte was the winning pitcher after working a perfect 10th inning Friday.	La Russa said Gonzalez showed guts giving Heyward the green light in that situation and "made it a real nervous situation."	"Not a lot of guys that I know would pull the trigger on that, just because if he gets thrown out you're going to get roasted by some," La Russa added.	Berkman had a walk and three singles on Friday and started Saturday with an infield hit, an RBI double and a walk before ending the run with a soft liner to short in the eighth.	Albert Pujols and David Freese had an RBI apiece in the first inning. Matt Holliday and Berkman hit consecutive one-out doubles in the third, and Molina added an RBI single in the inning for a 4-0 lead.	Freeman's two-run homer in the fourth was only the second by a left-handed batter against Garcia. Bourn singled, stole second and scored on Brian McCann's single in the fifth to make it a one-run game.	Lowe ended a string of four consecutive rookie starters for the Braves. He was also the first in five games to finish the sixth, topping 2,500 career innings and lessening the load a bit on the Atlanta bullpen. He gave up four runs and nine hits.	Lowe beat the Cardinals in the clinching Game 4 of the 2004 World Series with Boston, but has had little success in the regular season. He is 1-8 with a 6.79 ERA in 10 career starts against St. Louis, the lone victory coming in 2007 when he was with the Dodgers.	"For some unknown reason, this team gives me fits," Lowe said. "You look at the numbers against this team and it's awful."	Reminded of the World Series triumph at old Busch Stadium, Lowe muttered, "That was a long time ago."	Game notes	Tim Hudson (14-9, 3.14) faces Jake Westbrook (11-8, 4.65) in the finale of the Cardinals' nine-game homestand on Sunday. Hudson is 3-3 with a 5.25 ERA for his career against St. Louis. ... Atlanta 3B Chipper Jones got a day off and will play Sunday. McCann will get a rest. Jones is 2 for 15 with no RBIs this season against the Cardinals. ... Braves LHP George Sherrill (left elbow inflammation) resumed playing catch Saturday after being shut down for about a week after going on the DL on Aug. 31. ... Nick Punto's deciding sacrifice fly on Friday was his first game-ending hit. ... The Braves bullpen has totaled 38 innings in 11 games this month. ... Furcal is 9 for 20 with three RBIs against Lowe.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PHOENIX --  On a night when Arizona celebrated its Game 7 World Series thriller of a decade ago, the 2011 Diamondbacks managed some ninth-inning heroics of their own.	Chris Young and Lyle Overbay hit consecutive home runs off Heath Bell in the ninth to send the game into extra innings, then Joe Thatcher walked Overbay on four pitches in the 10th to bring in the winning run in Arizona's 6-5 victory over the San Diego Padres on Saturday night.	Overbay, who had the winning hit Friday night, had the distinction of being part of the pregame and postgame celebration, because he was a Diamondbacks rookie in 2001.	The ninth-inning uprising came seconds after the big screen showed Luis Gonzalez's ninth-inning bloop single against Mariano Rivera that gave Arizona its World Series triumph and the state's only major professional sports championship.	"Tonight was the perfect night to play the game that we played," Young said. "You know, sold-out crowd, just all the energy from the 2001 championship team being here, it was amazing."	The Diamondbacks stretched their franchise-record home winning streak to 15 games -- the longest in the majors this season. They have won 16 of 19 overall.	It was the 42nd come-from-behind victory for the Diamondbacks, who widened their NL West lead over second-place San Francisco 9 1/2 games after the Giants lost at home to Los Angeles. Milwaukee also lost, so Arizona moved a half-game ahead of the NL Central-leading Brewers for a possible home-field advantage in the first round of the playoffs.	"To be able to hit two home runs of Heath Bell, has that ever happened in the ninth inning?" Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson asked. "We were very fortunate to come back on a guy that's so good, who has had so much success, yet we did it."	The Padres protested the game because on the winning, bases-loaded walk, Miguel Montero, who was on second, did not touch third base. However, crew chief Tim Welke said that the applicable rule requires only that the batter who walked touch first and the runner on third touch home.	"We think that all runners have to touch each base," manager Bud Black said, "so we filed a protest and it is in the hands of MLB at this point."	James Darnell had three RBIs, including his first big league home run for the Padres, who have lost 16 of 19. San Diego's Chris Denorfia had four hits in five at bats.	Arizona's first sellout at Chase Field since the home opener (48,017) showed up for a pregame ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of the Diamondbacks' World Series triumph over the New York Yankees.	Bell, on the same field where he famously slid into the mound at this year's All-Star Game, blew a save for the fifth time in 41 opportunities.	"I didn't do my job big-time," he said.	Daniel Hernandez (4-3) threw a scoreless 10th for the victory. Brad Brach (0-1) took the loss.	San Diego carried a 5-3 lead into the bottom of the ninth but it evaporated in a hurry against Bell, who had given up two home runs all season.	"That I didn't do my job	Young hit a 1-1 pitch into the left-field seats to make it 5-4. Overbay connected on an 0-2 pitch to the opposite field, the ball barely clearing the fence in left field for his first home run since signing with Arizona as a free agent on Aug. 13.	"It's one of those things where I knew he was going to try to throw the fastball. He just got beat by CY with the slider," Overbay said. "He elevated the pitch before, so I thought he might do that again. It just didn't get as high maybe as he wanted."	Bell said that Overbay "probably used the speed of my pitch" to get the power he needed.	"He got good wood on it," he said. "I went inside, then back away. I thought it was a pretty good pitch. It was a pretty good pitch for him to hit out apparently."	In the 10th, Justin Upton drew a one-out walk from Brad Brach, then Miguel Montero singled to put runners at first and third. Geoff Blum was walked intentionally to bring up Young, who struck out on a 3-2 pitch. Bud Black brought in Thatcher, a sidearm-throwing lefty, to face the left-handed hitting Overbay, who walked on four pitches.	Tim Stauffer threw 5 1/3 effective innings for San Diego and got an RBI on a suicide squeeze bunt but no decision.	At their request, the Diamondbacks wore their throwback purple uniforms for the second game in a row as part of their weekend honor of the 2001 team. The crowd cheered wildly for members of that team during a pregame ceremony that included the World Series co-MVPs Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling, who threw out the ceremonial first pitches. Schilling's sailed over the head of his 2001 catcher Damian Miller.	After Darnell's home run off starter Wade Miley put San Diego up 4-2, Luis Martinez doubled, and Micah Owings relieved Miley. Alberto Gonzalez flew out to bring up Stauffer, who laid down a perfect bunt as Martinez barreled home from third, boosting the lead to 5-2. The Diamondbacks made it 5-3 in the sixth when Upton singled and Montero extended his hitting streak to 18 games with a double high off the center field wall. Geoff Blum's groundout brought Upton home but Montero was out at the plate attempting to score when a pitch from reliever Anthony Bass got past the catcher Martinez.	Aaron Hill and Upton singled off Chad Qualls to start the eighth but Montero grounded into a double play. Bell sprinted in to replace Qualls and got Blum to ground out to end the inning.	Game notes	 The leadoff batter reached base safely for San Diego in five of the first six innings and two of them scored. ... The Padres 2B Gonzalez made a leaping grab to rob Aaron Hill of a base hit in the first. ... Arizona is 24 games above .500 for the first time since Aug. 4, 2002. ... Rookie Josh Colmenter goes for his 10th victory for Arizona and San Diego sends left-hander Wade LeBlanc (2-5) to the mound in the finale of the four-game series on Sunday. ... The teams have three games remaining against each other next weekend in San Diego. ... The Diamondbacks' home-winning streak is the longest in the majors since 2004.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Dan Haren continued a streak of masterful outings by the Los Angeles Angels rotation against a pitcher who doesn't give up too many runs -- CC Sabathia.	Haren pitched a four-hitter for his fifth career shutout and retired 18 straight batters as the Angels climbed within 1½ games of the AL West lead with a 6-0 victory over the New York Yankees on Saturday night.	"Coming into the game, I knew that there was going to be a battle," Haren said after lowering his ERA to 3.06. "It was like a playoff atmosphere. When the Yankees come to town, it's always a little bit more exciting. That's a tough lineup, so I'm fortunate that I had my good stuff this time as opposed to my last time."	Haren (15-8) went the distance for the 15th time in 253 career starts and fourth time this season. The three-time All-Star right-hander struck out seven, and he walked none for the 13th time in his 31 starts.	"I wasn't aware of that, but my game is attacking the zone, making them put the ball in play. And with that, I need good defense behind me," Haren said after his 113-pitch outing. "Tonight, I got a couple of double plays and some great plays up the middle. It takes an all-around effort to enable me to attack the strike zone like that."	Jeff Mathis and Torii Hunter homered for the Angels, who have won six of seven and climbed within 1½ games of Texas in the AL West after trailing by as many as seven games on Aug. 17. They are as close to the Rangers as they've been since Aug. 10 and are doing their best to avoid looking past the next 14 games to their season-ending, three-game showdown in Anaheim.	"Technically, we control our own destiny because we've still got the Rangers three more times," Haren said. "But we're just trying to win every ballgame that we can. And we've been real scrappy. They haven't been the easiest wins, but we've played tough and we've played like a unit all year."	Haren held the AL East leaders to a pair of eighth-inning singles after giving up a ground-rule double to Derek Jeter on his second pitch and a single by rookie Jesus Montero leading off the second.	"We're just hungry," Hunter said. "We're grinding and we can smell that division title. So we just want to play every game close and keep it close. And Dan Haren gave us a chance to win. He was the starter and the closer. When you shut out the New York Yankees, you're doing something."	The Yankees squandered a chance to pad their division lead over Boston, which lost to Tampa Bay, and remained 2½ games in front. They have lost four in a row for the first time since a season-worst, six-game skid in May.	In Friday's series opener, Jered Weaver held them to three hits over eight innings and ended up with a no-decision as the Angels won in the ninth on Maicer Izturis' sacrifice fly.	"We need to swing the bats better," Jeter said. "When you're going up against good pitching, it's going to be tough at times. "This is one of those streaks where it doesn't seem like too many people are hitting."	Sabathia (19-8) threw 119 pitches in six innings, allowing a run and eight hits. He struck out five and walked four -- escaping bases-loaded jams in the first and sixth -- but failed in his bid to become the first Yankees pitcher in 31 years with back-to-back 20-win seasons.	Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez sat out because of a troublesome left thumb that has hindered him the past three weeks. He has been shut down for at least three days.	Yankees manager Joe Girardi fielded a lineup that had Eric Chavez filling in for Rodriguez, catcher Russell Martin starting in place of Francisco Cervelli, and infielder Eduardo Nunez starting in the outfield for the first time in two big league seasons because right fielder Nick Swisher sat out a second straight game because of pain in his left elbow.	It was the second consecutive day that Cervelli was scratched from the original lineup because of concussionlike symptoms stemming from his home-plate collision with Baltimore's Nick Markakis on Thursday.	In the second inning, Martin took a foul tip off the bat of Izturis and remained in the game after being checked out by the trainer. Izturis lined the next pitch over the head of center fielder Curtis Granderson for a double that scored Mathis.	Martin, however, was pulled before the Angels batted in the third after he appeared to have trouble throwing the ball back to the mound while warming up Sabathia because of a bruised right hand. X-rays were negative.	"It hit the end of the thumb and bent the nail right in the middle," Martin said. "I couldn't really feel the baseball in my hand when I threw to second base. I knew at some point the feeling was going to come back. It just took a little longer than I anticipated."	Jorge Posada, who hadn't caught all season, came out in his gear to the delight of hundreds of Yankees fans, who gave him a thunderous ovation.	"I got a chance to get back behind the plate," Posada said. "I have my equipment with me. I'm an emergency catcher, like I was today. Joe said, 'What do you think?' So I said, 'Well, if you need me, I'm there.' He said, 'Go ahead. It's like riding a bike.' I was excited. It was fun. I'll be sore tomorrow, but I'll sleep well tonight."	Howie Kendrick led off with an infield single, then tried to steal second and was erased by Posada, a five-time All-Star catcher limited to first base and designated hitter duty this season.	"It showed a lot of guts to go back there and do what he did," said Girardi, who took a lot of heat from Posada for putting Posada ninth in the batting order earlier this season. "I thought he did fine. He'll get back there every once in a while to warm up a pitcher in-between innings and it kind of gives him that feel. But it's not easy."	The Angels broke it open with a four-run seventh against Hector Noesi. Mike Trout hit an RBI single, and Erick Aybar followed with another sacrifice fly, and Mathis capped the rally with a two-run homer.	Game notes	 Wells stranded all eight runners that were on base during his five at-bats. ... The run Mathis scored in the second was the 1,000th allowed by Sabathia, who fanned Hunter in the third inning for his 2,000th career strikeout. The only left-handers younger than the 31-year-old Sabathia to reach 2,000 strikeouts were Sandy Koufax (29) and Sam McDowell (28). The only other active pitchers to reach the mark are Javier Vazquez and Tim Wakefield.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Bruce Bochy has walked into the manager's office every day this September expecting his San Francisco Giants to show some life. That day has yet to come.	It likely won't this year.	After the latest scoreless performance to the rival Los Angeles Dodgers knocked the Giants 9½ games behind Arizona in the NL West, Bochy finally vented about his team's horrendous offense and all but admitted the playoff race is over.	"We're bad right now with the bats," he said. "We're awful. There's no other way to say it."	Dana Eveland combined with two relievers to throw a six-hitter, and the Dodgers delivered another blow to the Giants' dismal playoff hopes with a 3-0 victory over the defending World Series champions on Saturday night.	The pitching performance extended San Francisco's scoreless streak to 17 innings. The Giants have had only two runners reach third base in that span, and about all they can do now is play out the remainder of the season.	"You're obligated to go out there and give it your best," Bochy said. "We're fortunate to be here every game and have it sold out and have these great fans here. That's what makes it so much tougher -- at home is where we're so bad."	Juan Rivera had three singles and drove in a run off Ryan Vogelsong (10-7) to lift the Dodgers back to .500 with their 15th win in 18 games. Vogelsong gave up three runs in eight innings -- including one on a balk -- for his fifth straight loss.	For the first time this September, San Francisco started to show signs that it's already moving ahead to next year.	Bochy filled out his lineup with rookies and up-and-comers: Hector Sanchez made his first start at catcher, Brett Pill was at first, Brandon Belt played left field and Justin Christian was out in center.	The revamped lineup did nothing to ignite San Francisco's offense.	James Loney hit a one-out triple off Vogelsong in the second inning, and scored on Jerry Sands' groundout to give the Dodgers a 1-0 lead.	Matt Kemp lined a triple to right leading off the fourth. Rivera followed with an RBI single, the first of three straight infield hits for Los Angeles.	As if that wasn't enough to frustrate Vogelsong, he balked in a run with the bases loaded to extend the Dodgers' lead to 3-0. Vogelsong argued unsuccessfully with second-base umpire Laz Diaz and paced the infield furiously over the call.	"Even though they weren't hitting the balls hard, they were finding holes. It happens," Vogelsong said.	The right-hander rallied to get three straight outs and limit the damage. Of course, with San Francisco's scoring woes, that was more than enough for the Dodgers.	The closest the Giants came to scoring was a dismal two-out rally in the fourth, when Pablo Sandoval singled and Brett Pill doubled down the line in left. With a chance to knock home two runs, Brandon Belt lined out to third.	"His two outings have been really good," Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said of Eveland. "He throws strikes and gets ahead of hitters. If he keeps pitching like that, it's tough to keep a guy out."	Things would only get worse for the home team.	Carlos Beltran caught Jerry Sands' flyout in right field for the second out of the eighth and started jogging toward the dugout, apparently thinking it was the final out of the inning. Tony Gwynn Jr. easily went from second to third, and Giants fans booed Beltran -- the prize acquisition at the trade deadline from the New York Mets -- and several others left their seats.	Eveland was lifted for Jansen after he walked Sanchez to open the bottom of the eighth. After pinch hitter Mark DeRosa singled to put runners on first and third with no outs, the Giants again went out with a whimper.	Pinch hitter Aubrey Huff and Jeff Keppinger struck out swinging, and Beltran ground out to second to end the inning. All fans could do was boo.	Game notes	 Giants C Buster Posey threw a light toss for the first time since he tore three ligaments in his left ankle and fractured a bone in his leg in a home-plate collision with Florida's Scott Cousins on May 25. He is on schedule to be ready by spring training. ... Giants LHP Barry Zito (ankle) will take fielding practice Sunday and is expected to be activated before the game. ... The Dodgers will send RHP Hiroki Kuroda (11-15) to the mound in the series finale Sunday against Giants LHP Madison Bumgarner (10-12).	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SEATTLE --  Felipe Paulino has come a long way in just four months.	Paulino, who was designated for assignment May 22 by Colorado and acquired by Kansas City for cash four days later, had one of the finest outings of his career Saturday night. He struck out 11 and allowed two hits in seven innings in a 4-2 victory over the Seattle Mariners.	Eric Hosmer hit a two-run homer in the first and Jeff Francoeur added an insurance solo shot in the ninth.	Paulino (3-10) gave up homers to Justin Smoak and Mike Carp, but he tamed the rest of the Mariners. He tied his career high in strikeouts and walked none.	"I showed my stuff today: changeup, curveball, fastball, slider, sinker," said Paulino, who has won two of last three decisions. "Sometimes maybe they not work. Today, they stick together."	Michael Pineda (9-10), who worked a career-high eight innings, was the losing pitcher. He allowing three runs -- all in the first inning -- and five hits. He struck out eight and walked one.	Pineda, who hasn't won since July 30, now has 171 strikeouts, second most for a Mariners rookie behind Mark Langston, who had 204 in 1984.	"It was a pretty good game for both guys. Pineda pitched very well. He's young, too," Paulino said. "But at the end we got the win, not the loss. That's happened to me early in the season."	Joakim Soria pitched the ninth for his 27th save in 34 opportunities.	The two hits allowed were a season low for the Royals. The combined 16 strikeouts were two short of the staff's season high.	"He (Paulino) threw the ball extremely well," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "His stuff was electric. Pineda's stuff was electric. If you're going to get to him, you better get to him early because if he settles down you're going to get what we got. And we did. We got to him early and hung on."	The Royals rattled Pineda in the first. Alex Gordon opened with a double to right. Melky Cabrera moved him to third with a right-side groundout. Billy Butler, 0 for 16 in the series, still managed to bring Gordon home with a fielder's choice grounder to first baseman Smoak, who threw home late.	Hosmer then hit a 1-0 pitch into the left-field bullpen.	"He had just one hit tonight but he smoked one to center, smoked one to left," Yost said of Hosmer. "He's in a nice groove right now. He's seeing the ball good, he's sitting back. His outs are real loud."	Pineda, in his 27th career start, has had trouble all season in the first inning. He had a 6.00 ERA in the inning, allowing six home runs.	"Pineda threw well tonight. Unfortunately, that first inning home run, and the three runs scored," Carp said. "He threw as well as I've seen him in a while. It just sucks we didn't have any hits for him."	Smoak got one back in the second, lining his 14th home run just over the right-field wall on a 2-2 pitch from Paulino.	Two innings later, Carp connected on his ninth home run, a 419-foot shot into the left-field bullpen, also on a 2-2 pitch.	Miguel Olivo reached on a throwing error by third baseman Mike Moustakas in the fifth. Kyle Seager lined out to Cabrera in center, who threw to first before Olivo could hustle back for a double play.	It was the Royals' major league-leading 49th outfield assist, most in the majors since 2002 and four short of the club record.	In successive plays in the seventh, Francoeur climbed the right-field wall to snatch a potential extra-base hit from Carp, then Moustakas ran down a warning track shot by Smoak to deep center.	"Again Frenchy (Francoeur) saved the game for us with a nice catch in right field," Yost said. "Melky made it back-to-back nice catches."	Hosmer added, "on this road trip Frenchy has made some of the greatest plays I've ever seen."	Carp made an outstanding diving catch in the eighth to rob Hosmer and extra bases.	Game notes	 An unknown Mariners 'artist' played a joke on CF Trayvon Robinson before the game. Robinson crashed against the outfield wall chasing down a flyball Friday, so when he arrived at the ballpark he saw that someone had used athletic tape to shape a body outline impacting the wall. "That's good. Guys are in good spirits," manager Eric Wedge said. "That's a good sign." ... Miguel Olivo, who had a triple, double and home run Friday, missed the cycle by one hit for the 315th time in club history. He is the sixth to fall a single short. ... Two Royals players have at least 40 doubles: Francoeur (44) and Gordon (43). Cabrera (39) and Butler (38) are close. If Cabrera reaches 40, the Royals will be the first team in history to have all three outfielders with 40. If Butler reaches, the Royals will be the fourth team in history to have four with at least 40. ... LH Anthony Vasquez (1-2, 9.00) will make his fourth career start Sunday against the Royals. The Royals also will start a lefty, Everett Teaford (0-0, 3.21), who is more experienced but new to the rotation. He has had 24 appearances out of the bullpen but this will be his first start.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DETROIT --  Jose Valverde dropped to one knee, then quickly stood up on his left foot, kicking his other leg high in the air and pumping his right fist.	Even by the big closer's exuberant standards, this was a special celebration.	Valverde set a team record with his 43rd save, and the Detroit Tigers beat the Minnesota Twins 2-1 on Sunday for their ninth straight victory. The last time the Tigers won this many games in a row was 1984, when they went on to win the World Series.	"I'm happy," Valverde said. "My team is in first place, and that's what I want."	The Tigers lead second-place Chicago by 10½ games in the AL Central, and their magic number is seven.	Doug Fister (8-13) pitched seven scoreless innings, allowing three hits in another terrific start for the Tigers. He's 5-1 since being acquired from Seattle on July 30.	Joaquin Benoit pitched the eighth, and Valverde allowed a run in the ninth but held on for his 43rd save in 43 chances. Valverde walked Joe Mauer and Luke Hughes singled to start the ninth. Chris Parmelee flied out to shallow left, and pinch hitter Jason Kubel drove in a run with a groundout to first, moving the tying run into scoring position.	When Rene Tosoni struck out swinging to end it, the always-demonstrative Valverde began his latest celebration at the mound. Detroit's Todd Jones had 42 saves in 2000.	"It's good, but I want to go to the World Series, big celebration, and be the champion," Valverde said.	Detroit scored both of its runs in the first. Delmon Young singled in Austin Jackson and Magglio Ordonez scored when Victor Martinez bounced into a double play. Second baseman Matt Tolbert made a key error on a potential double-play grounder by Miguel Cabrera.	Martinez ended up hitting into four double plays, becoming the first player to do that since Joe Torre on July 21, 1975, for the New York Mets against Houston, according to STATS, LLC.	Martinez grounded into double plays in his first three at-bats, then came up with a man on first in the eighth and hit a line drive that was caught by Parmelee, the first baseman. After diving toward first to make the catch, Parmelee simply reached out and touched the base to double off the runner.	"I felt like high-fiving Victor -- he was making outs like crazy for us," Twins manager Ron Gardenhire joked. "Apparently, it takes a great hitter to make eight outs in one game, because I've never seen anything like that. Even he looked like he was laughing after the line drive for the fourth one. If I were Victor, I'd probably go home and have a glass of ... orange juice. Maybe even with something else in it."	Minnesota starter Scott Diamond (1-4) allowed two runs, one earned, and seven hits in six innings. He struck out four and walked four.	The Twins have lost eight of nine.	Fister was acquired to give the Tigers more pitching depth, but he's staked a legitimate claim to being Detroit's second-best starter behind Justin Verlander. In his last five starts, he's allowed three earned runs in 36 2/3 innings, striking out 36 and walking four.	Minnesota had runners on first and second with one out in the fifth, but shortstop Jhonny Peralta made a nice stop on Tolbert's grounder for a force play at second. Fister struck out Drew Butera to end the threat.	Fister finished with five strikeouts and two walks.	The 6-foot-8 Fister also made a couple graceful defensive plays. The right-hander knocked down one comebacker with his glove hand, then scooped up the ball without breaking stride and threw to first for an out. He later jumped to catch a soft line drive up the middle.	"That's something I take pride in, something I have fun with," Fister said. "The best advice I ever got was: 'Try and stay athletic and have some fun."	Game notes	 The game was played in 2 hours, 19 minutes. ... The Tigers and Detroit Lions won on the same day for the first time since Sept. 30, 2007. ... Minnesota INF Danny Valencia was scratched from the lineup with right shoulder soreness. ... Ordonez extended his hitting streak to 11 games with a first-inning single. ... The Tigers travel to Chicago for a three-game series with the White Sox. They'll send Rick Porcello (13-8) to the mound Monday night against John Danks (6-11). ... Minnesota's next game is Tuesday night at Kansas City. Carl Pavano (8-11) will start for the Twins against Bruce Chen (10-7).	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

TORONTO --  Adam Loewen once tried to prevent home runs as a Baltimore Orioles pitcher. On Sunday, he drilled a game-tying shot against his original team.	A converted pitcher now playing the outfield, Loewen hit his first major league homer to help the Toronto Blue Jays beat the Orioles 6-5.	"I know so many of the guys over there, it was special to do it against them," said Loewen, who was both a pitcher and position player in high school and junior college.	Jose Bautista drove in the tiebreaking run with a seventh-inning sacrifice fly, sending Baltimore to its 29th loss in its last 34 games in Toronto dating to June 2008.	David Cooper also went deep as the Blue Jays rallied to win for the second straight game, overcoming a 5-3 deficit with a three-run seventh against right-hander Tommy Hunter (3-4).	Cooper, who has come up through Toronto's minor league ranks alongside Loewen, said his teammate's switch from power arm to power hitter is "unreal."	"I remember when he first made the transition and it's night and day," Cooper said. "It's amazing how quickly he's picked up hitting. There's a lot of things to come. He's got a lot of power."	Hunter, who gave up Loewen's shot, expects to be reminded of it for some time to come.	"We have the same agent so I'm probably going to hear about this for the rest of the time that we're together," Hunter said. "He's gone through a lot of adversity in the game of baseball. To come back and be productive in the big leagues, not only as a pitcher but coming back at a different position is just ridiculous. Give him a lot of credit."	Baltimore's first-round draft pick in 2003, Loewen pitched in 35 games for the Orioles between 2006 and 2008 before giving up pitching because of recurring stress fractures in his elbow. He signed a minor league contract with Toronto that winter and began his comeback as a position player, getting called up to the majors last Wednesday after finishing the year at Triple-A Las Vegas with a .306 average, 17 homers and 86 RBIs.	Joel Carreno (1-0) pitched a scoreless inning for his first career win and Frank Francisco finished for his 14th save in 18 opportunities.	Cooper led off the inning with a drive to right, his second. J.P. Arencibia, whose ninth-inning single gave Toronto a 5-4 win Saturday, hit a deep drive to center that Matt Angle caught at the wall. Loewen followed with a shot to almost the same spot, but that one cleared the fence for a tying homer.	"I didn't really think he got it that good but he's a big, strong guy and he got it out to center field, so I tip my hat to him," Orioles infielder Chris Davis said.	Mike McCoy doubled and Eric Thames singled to chase Hunter before Bautista hit the tiebreaking sacrifice fly off Willie Eyre.	Vladimir Guerrero's sacrifice fly gave Baltimore a 1-0 lead in the first but Toronto answered with two unearned runs in the bottom half. After McCoy reached on an error and Eric Thames on a single, Bautista hit an RBI single and Brett Lawrie's groundout drove in another run.	The Orioles used a walk and three straight singles to tie it in the second, with Angle's base hit scoring Davis.	Toronto reclaimed the lead in the third. McCoy singled, snapping an 0-for-15 slump, took second on a groundout and moved to third on a fly ball before scoring on Adam Lind's single.	The Orioles answered in the fourth, chasing Toronto starter Dustin McGowan after he opened the inning with back-to-back walks. Carlos Villanueva came on and struck out Roberto Andino, then got Angle on a groundout, with the runners advancing to second and third. J.J. Hardy was walked intentionally to bring up Nick Markakis, who lined a two-run single to right.	Baltimore made it 5-3 with a run in the sixth against Shawn Camp. Angle drew a leadoff walk, went to third on Markakis' ground-rule double and scored on a grounder by Matt Wieters.	Making his first start since July 8, 2008, also against Baltimore, McGowan struggled with his control, allowing three runs and four hits in three-plus innings. He walked five and struck out none.	"This is a rehab year. There's going to be peaks and valleys with arm strength along the way," Blue Jays manager John Farrell said.	Villanueva pitched two innings of relief. Camp, Carreno and Casey Janssen each worked one inning before Francisco closed it out.	Hunter, who has not won in three starts, allowed six runs and nine hits in 6 1/3 innings. He walked none and struck out five.	Game notes	 Orioles CF Adam Jones was scratched for the second straight game with a sore left ankle. Jones fouled a pitch off his ankle Friday. ... Toronto SS Yunel Escobar, who left Saturday's game after being hit on the left elbow by a pitch, did not start. He is day-to-day. ... Cooper's homer was Toronto's major league-leading 43rd by a rookie. ... Orioles RHP Jason Berken (strained right forearm) is expected to come off the disabled list when the team returns home Monday to begin a three-game series with Tampa Bay. ... To commemorate the 10th anniversary of Sept. 11, members of the Toronto Police and Toronto Fire Department presented the colors and a Toronto firefighter sang the national anthems while the players lined the basepaths. In lieu of a first pitch, Blue Jays LHP Ricky Romero placed the ball on the mound before a moment of silence. Players wore a uniform patch and two special crests were painted on the field.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

WASHINGTON --  Stephen Strasburg had just started to feel good on the mound when his manager told him he was finished for the day.	Making his second major league start since undergoing Tommy John surgery, Strasburg allowed one run over three innings in Washington's 8-2 win against the Houston Astros on Sunday.	After the right-hander worked a perfect third, Nationals manager Davey Johnson let him know he was coming out.	"I explained to him, 'Look, I don't want to have to go out and hook you during an inning, and as far as I'm concerned it was like your second time out in spring training,'" Johnson said. "That's enough for me."	Strasburg didn't display the same efficiency he did in his return Tuesday. He needed 31 pitches to get out of the first inning, although he settled down and finished with six straight outs. The top draft pick of 2009 allowed three hits and struck out four in his 57-pitch outing.	Johnson said his young star was on a 70-pitch limit, but he decided to pull him earlier, especially after Strasburg's velocity seemed to drop slightly in the second inning.	"He said, 'Just three?' I said, 'Yeah. Just three.' But I expected that," Johnson said.	Strasburg called the short outing "frustrating," but he also understood Johnson's caution.	"He has my best interests at heart, and I trust him 100 percent," Strasburg said. "I'm going to go out there until he says I'm done, and today he said I was done in the third."	Strasburg's pitch count was almost exactly the same as it was in his first start back, when he threw 56 pitches over five scoreless innings and struck out four against the Dodgers. It was clear from the start Sunday he wasn't going to cruise through the Astros' lineup the same way -- he needed nine pitches to strike out leadoff batter Jordan Schafer.	Strasburg went to a full count on the first three batters, although he struck out two of them. The other, No. 2 hitter Jimmy Paredes, singled on a grounder up the middle that went through Strasburg's legs and bounced off second base. The fourth batter, Carlos Lee, singled on a 2-2 fastball to score Paredes.	Strasburg also allowed a leadoff hit in the second inning to Matt Downs, then finished with six straight outs.	"If I wasn't on a pitch count, it would have been nice to go out there and pitch longer in the game," Strasburg said. "That's how it's going to be sometimes. You're not going to go out there and feel perfect every time."	Ian Desmond, Rick Ankiel and Ryan Zimmerman all homered off Houston starter Henry Sosa (2-4) to start the third inning. It was the first time the Nationals had hit back-to-back-to-back home runs since July 11, 2009, at Houston. That was also the last time the Astros had allowed three straight homers.	"I think the nicest thing about that was to finally have a lead," Desmond said. "The last few series we've been behind and we've all been kind of defensive. So today I wanted to make sure -- I think we all wanted to make sure -- that we stayed aggressive."	The Astros (49-97) tied the franchise mark for most losses in a season. They have lost 97 games three times, most recently in 1991.	"It speaks for itself," said outfielder J.D. Martinez, who was 0 for 3. "It was just one of those nights."	To mark the 10th anniversary of 9/11, Washington wore special blue jerseys with a stars-and-stripes background for the team's 'W' logo. Two red, blue and white logos were painted on the field in foul territory along the base lines, with the date "September 11, 2001" and the words: "We shall not forget."	Chris Marrero drove in two runs with a sacrifice fly in the second to tie the game and an RBI double in the third. Zimmerman and Desmond also had two RBIs each.	Tom Gorzelanny (3-6) followed Strasburg and pitched three scoreless innings, giving up one hit.	Sosa, making his seventh major league start, allowed five runs and seven hits in 2 2/3 innings, the first time he has failed to go at least five innings.	Game notes	 Nationals 2B Danny Espinosa snapped an 0-for-15 slump with a double in the second inning. He was 2 for 4 with two doubles. ... Nationals rookies dressed in Smurfs costumes -- including blue body paint on their torsos -- after the game in a hazing ritual. ... Houston purchased the contract of LHP Xavier Cedeno from Triple-A Oklahoma City and placed LHP Sergio Escalona on the 60-day disabled list. Cedeno flew from Puerto Rico to join the team in Washington, although his luggage and equipment didn't arrive with him. "We'll get him some shoes and a glove and go from there," manager Brad Mills said before the game. ... The Nationals start a four-game series at the New York Mets on Monday. LHP Ross Detwiler (2-5) will start for Washington against RHP R.A. Dickey (8-11). ... Houston hosts Philadelphia on Monday. RHP Brett Myers (4-13) opposes Phillies RHP Roy Oswalt (7-8) in a matchup of pitchers facing their former teams.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PITTSBURGH --  Javier Vazquez might want to put those retirement thoughts on hold.	Vazquez added to his last-season surge by pitching six scoreless innings Sunday, helping the Florida Marlins complete a season sweep of the Pittsburgh Pirates with a 4-1 victory.	Vazquez (10-11) struck out seven, allowed three hits and walked two while improving to 4-2 with a 1.95 ERA in his last nine starts. The 35-year-old right-hander, who has talked about retiring at the end of the season, went 3-8 with a 6.85 ERA in his first 14 starts of the season.	"He's pitched great since that rough start," Florida catcher Brett Hayes said. "He's been amazing. He just knows how to pitch."	Florida manager Jack McKeon certainly isn't an advocate for retirement as he is still going strong at 80. But he said would not broach the subject with Vazquez.	"I'm not going to talk him into retirement and he's not going to talk me into retirement," cracked McKeon, who was an adviser for Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria when he returned to the dugout in June to replace Edwin Rodriguez. "Certain guys have that desire to spend time with their family. Heck, I do, too, sometimes."	"It's his decision," McKeon added. "If this it for him, I'd like to see him get to 12-11 and go out a winner."	Vazquez credits his turnaround to aggressiveness.	"I'm throwing more strikes, pounding the strike zone and going after the hitters," he said.	Vazquez reached double-digit victories for the 12th straight season dating to 2000 when he was with Montreal. He also has pitched for the New York Yankees, Arizona, the Chicago White Sox and Atlanta.	"I've been healthy and I've tried to be consistent in what I do," Vazquez said.	Florida won for the sixth time in eight games and improved to 6-0 against the Pirates this year, including all three games this weekend for its first series sweep in Pittsburgh since 2000, the year before PNC Park opened. The Marlins have won 14 of their last 16 against Pittsburgh overall.	Florida scored all of its runs in the fifth. Vazquez opened the inning with a walk against James McDonald (9-8) and scored on Gregg Dobbs' two-out double. Gaby Sanchez then singled home Dobbs and Bryan Petersen walked ahead of Donnie Murphy, who chased McDonald with a two-run double to center.	Vazquez was running on a 1-1 pitch when Dobbs hit his double.	"I wish Dobber wouldn't have hit the ball because I wanted the stolen base," joked Vazquez, who has no steals in his 14-year career.	McKeon seemed even more impressed by Vazquez's baserunning that his pitching.	"I hope our pitchers were watching because he wouldn't have scored if he hadn't taken off with the pitch," McKeon said. "Because they're pitchers they think, `Ah, we're not supposed to run hard.' Well, if you don't get people out then you better run hard."	Leo Nunez pitched a perfect ninth for his 34th save in 40 opportunities.	McDonald allowed five hits, walked four and struck out three. He is 5-2 with a 3.27 ERA in 15 home starts this season.	"It was too methodical," Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said of McDonald in the fifth inning. "There was too much down time instead of getting on the mound, getting the sign and making the next pitch. It's something he's going to have to incorporate to take the next step."	Jason Jaramillo hit a two-out RBI single in the seventh to snap Pittsburgh's 16-inning scoreless drought. The Pirates moved within two losses of clinching their 19th straight losing season.	Anibal Sanchez threw a one-hit shutout against the Pirates on Saturday night.	Game notes	 Pittsburgh C Ryan Doumit left after five innings with a bruised chest, which he injured when he was crossed up by a pitch from McDonald in the fourth. ... Florida was without its starting outfield of LF Logan Morrison (bruised left knee), CF Mike Cameron (strained right hamstring) and RF Mike Stanton (strained right hamstring) for a second straight game. Morrison's knee was still swollen after he crashed into the side wall while making a catch Friday night. ... Keystone, the Clinton County, Pa.-based team that was the darling of the Little League World Series last month, was honored in a pregame ceremony. ... The Marlins open a three-game series at Atlanta on Monday night while Pittsburgh starts a three-game set against St. Louis. Florida RHP Chris Volstad (5-12, 5.37 ERA) will face RHP Brandon Beachy (7-2, 3.29 ERA). Volstad is 0-4 with a 4.60 ERA in five starts since returning from Triple-A New Orleans. Pirates RHP Brad Lincoln (1-2, 3.53 ERA) will start against RHP Kyle Lohse (13-8, 3.59 ERA). Lincoln has a 2.70 ERA in five starts since being moved into the rotation from the bullpen.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  James Shields and the Tampa Bay Rays got the sweep they needed to charge back into the playoff race.	Shields came within two outs of his 12th complete game this season, B.J. Upton hit his first grand slam and the Rays routed the fading Boston Red Sox 9-1 on Sunday.	Tampa Bay moved within 3½ games of the AL wild card leaders, sweeping the three-game series to go a season-high 17 games over .500 at 81-64. The Rays have won 21 games in a row when scoring five runs or more.	"We needed to win these," manager Joe Maddon said. "There's no other way to look at it. Under the circumstances, you've got to do what we did or it's pretty much almost impossible to recover. Our guys believe we can do this. It's truly not impossible."	Tampa Bay was 10 games behind the New York Yankees in the wild-card standings on Aug. 7.	Boston has lost five consecutive games, its longest skid since opening the season 0-6, and nine of 11 overall. The teams play each other four more times, in a four-game series beginning Thursday night at Fenway Park.	"We're kind of in a fight right now, we know that," Red Sox manager Terry Francona said about his team's recent play. "It's not real pretty. We'll come out and fight, and hopefully play better. I always feel like we're going to play well and when we don't, we're going to fix it. I still feel that way."	Shields (15-10), who has won four consecutive starts en route to his career-best 15th win, allowed seven hits over 8 1/3 innings. Coming off a 5-1 complete-game victory over Texas last Monday, the right-hander was replaced by Dane De La Rosa after issuing a one-out walk in the ninth on his 121st pitch.	"We're back in the hunt," Shields said. "They know that we're right behind them."	The Rays went up 8-1 on Upton's 20th homer in the fifth off Matt Albers.	Upton finished with four hits and walked once. He and his brother Justin of the Arizona Diamondbacks became the first set of siblings in major league history to both have 20 homers and 20 stolen bases in the same season.	"Couldn't ask for a better day," B.J. Upton said.	Jon Lester (15-7) gave up four runs and eight hits over four innings for the Red Sox. Boston starting pitchers have gone five innings or less in nine of the last 11 games.	Boston is off Monday, while Tampa Bay will begin an 11-game road trip at Baltimore. Rays right-hander Jeff Niemann (9-7) will go against left-hander Zach Britton (9-9).	"I don't think there will be a letdown," Niemann said. "I think everyone knows what our goal is here. Take care of business. ... We have to win."	The Red Sox did get some encouraging news: Francona said Josh Beckett, out with a sprained right ankle, is scheduled to throw off a bullpen mound Monday.	After loading the bases with no outs in the first, Tampa Bay took a 2-0 lead on Ben Zobrist's two-run single off Lester. Sean Rodriguez made it 3-0 later in the inning with a sacrifice fly.	Lester had allowed one earned run or less in his previous five starts, going 4-0 during that stretch. The left-hander threw 43 pitches in the first and 111 overall.	Rodriguez put the Rays up 4-1 with an RBI double in the third.	Marco Scutaro got the Red Sox within 3-1 on a third-inning homer. It stopped a personal stretch of 161 at-bats without a home run, dating to July 15 against Tampa Bay.	Shields worked out of a bases-loaded, one-out jam later in the third when David Ortiz flied out and Josh Reddick was retired on a foul pop.	The Red Sox had two on and one out in the second, but Jason Varitek hit a double-play grounder.	Boston's Jacoby Ellsbury, who turned 28 on Sunday, extended his hitting streak to 16 games with a fifth-inning single.	Game notes	 Rays closer Kyle Farnsworth (right elbow) will be re-evaluated Tuesday. ... Boston RHP John Lackey (bruised left calf) is listed to make his next scheduled start on Wednesday. ... Red Sox RHP Clay Buchholz (back) threw at 60 feet on level ground and could soon be ready to throw off a bullpen mound. ... Tampa Bay purchased the contract of utility man Russ Canzler and recalled De La Rosa from Triple-A Durham. RHP Mike Ekstrom was designated for assignment. ... Boston RHP Tim Wakefield (6-6), still looking for his 200th career win, will face Toronto RHP Brandon Morrow (9-10) on Tuesday night.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO -- Luis Valbuena had a a big zero in the home-run column, and it was bothering him.	He can rest easy now.	Valbuena connected for a solo shot and Ubaldo Jimenez threw six effective innings, leading the Cleveland Indians to a 7-3 victory over the Chicago White Sox.	Valbuena also singled twice and scored two runs as the Indians collected 14 hits. Trevor Crowe had three singles, and Jason Donald and Lonnie Chisenhall added two hits apiece.	"I feel good because I was working all day in the cage and made an adjustment," Valbuena said.	Valbuena drove an 0-2 pitch from Will Ohman over the wall in right in the sixth, making it 4-2 Tribe. It was Valbuena's first extra-base hit and RBI this season. He entered the game just 5 for 34 on the season at the big league level despite hitting .302 in 113 games for Triple-A Columbus.	"He's tough to read because he's never looked overmatched, but the numbers don't add up," Indians manager Manny Acta said. "He was our best hitter in Triple-A the whole year. ... Today he had a very good day. I'm happy for Luis because he's had enough hard times up here the last two years."	Valbuena especially enjoyed his first major league homer since April 16, 2010.	"I'm so happy because I don't want to see the zero there," Valbuena said.	Crowe entered the game hitless in seven at-bats. After starting 106 games in the outfield for Cleveland in 2010, Crowe had shoulder surgery on March 30 and was activated on Wednesday.	"It was good to see him do that," Acta said. "He spent the whole season basically in Arizona rehabbing. ... It's nice to see him have some success so he'll have some confidence going forward."	Despite the slow start since his return, Crowe felt he was about to break through.	"I felt like for the amount of time off, I was seeing the ball really well and it was only a matter of time before I started making some solid contact," Crowe said.	Jimenez (3-2) issued five walks, but allowed just two runs and three hits. The right-hander, who was acquired from Colorado before the July 31 trade deadline, struck out two and improved to 2-1 with a 3.12 ERA over his last four outings.	"I felt good out there," Jimenez said. "I only had a couple of innings (when) I couldn't find the strike zone. I think I was trying to throw too many breaking balls and couldn't control them."	While his command was shaky, Jimenez reached the upper 90s with his fastball, important for a pitcher who has struggled with inconsistent velocity this season.	"When I got to the fifth inning, I (thought the fastball) was my best pitch today," Jimenez said.	White Sox starter Zach Stewart (2-4) yielded three runs and seven hits over five innings in his first outing since he tossed a one-hitter at Minnesota last Monday.	"I wasn't hitting spots like I was last outing, like I should have been," Stewart said. "I missed some spots. Some of my breaking balls weren't as sharp, I left them over the plate and got hit around a little bit."	Alejandro De Aza went 2 for 3, scored two runs and stole two bases for Chicago. Juan Pierre and Alexei Ramirez each singled twice and drove in a run.	Jimenez walked the bases full in the fourth, the last of the free passes issued to Brent Morel, who has drawn seven of his 14 walks this season since Sept. 1. Jimenez got Gordon Beckham on a grounder to third to escape the threat.	The White Sox also left the bases full four times on Saturday.	"Well, you know we continue to leave people on base," White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen said. "Jimenez throw 100 pitches. I never see a guy throw 100 pitches and only (allow) two runs."	The Indians broke it open with three runs in the eighth against Matt Thornton. Donald drove in a run with an infield hit and Carlos Santana lashed a two-run double to right.	The Indians earned a split in the four-game series between teams chasing Detroit in the AL Central. The Tigers won their ninth in a row Sunday and lead Chicago by 10 1/2 games and Cleveland by 11.	"We played right into the Tigers' hands basically," Acta said. "That what we did this series, kill each other while they continue to win."	Game notes	 White Sox RHP Jake Peavy will not pitch again this season. The 2007 NL Cy Young Award winner will rest in an effort to come back at full strength in 2012. Peavy had shoulder surgery last season. Rookie Dylan Axelrod will start in Peavy's place on Wednesday. ... The Indians activated DH Travis Hafner (strained right foot) from the disabled list. Acta said Hafner will split time at DH with Jim Thome for the remainder of the season. ... The White Sox will try to keep their slim playoff hopes alive when they open a three-game series against Detroit at U.S. Cellular Field on Monday. Rick Porcello will face Chicago's John Danks in the opener. ... The Indians' 10-game trip continues with a stop in Texas on Monday for the opener of a three-game set. Justin Masterson will start for Cleveland against Matt Harrison.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

MILWAUKEE --  Nyjer Morgan slid into second and let out a mighty roar of relief after a long, frustrating series.	Ryan Braun singled in the go-ahead run in the seventh after Morgan's tying hit and the slumping Brewers rallied for a much-needed 3-2 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Sunday that snapped their skid at five.	"We realize we can play with them," Brewers right fielder Corey Hart said. "It'll prepare us for later on."	Trailing 2-1, Milwaukee strung together three consecutive hits with two out in the seventh to keep its dwindling NL Central lead at six with 14 games left. Second-place St. Louis also won, beating Atlanta 6-3.	Brewers starter Yovani Gallardo (16-10) matched a career high with 12 strikeouts over seven innings, but allowed homers to Shane Victorino and Ryan Howard in the sixth.	"They have a tough team, we all know that," Gallardo said.	Milwaukee (86-62) responded in the seventh. Hart and Morgan hit consecutive doubles to tie it. Braun followed with his clutch hit after he and Prince Fielder had been 0 for 4 with runners in scoring position.	"When you play against teams this good with the pitching staff as good as they are, you know you're not going to get a lot of opportunities," Braun said. "We had some chances, I definitely had some chances and didn't come through, so it was nice for us to come through in that seventh inning."	Philadelphia stranded runners at the corners in the eighth when Howard grounded out against Francisco Rodriguez.	John Axford allowed a one-out single by Pete Orr and a two-out walk to Michael Martinez before John Bowker popped out weakly. Axford has converted 39 consecutive save opportunities and is 42 for 44 overall.	"It's huge. It'd been a frustrating series so far," Axford said. "Today, it seemed a little that way, too, frustrating at times toward the end of the game, but we kept fighting."	Philadelphia had won six straight and was on an even bigger roll when Vance Worley (11-2) was on the mound. The Phillies had won Worley's last 14 starts dating to May 29, one short of the franchise record set when Steve Carlton was on the mound in 1972.	"It was fantastic. What all do I need to say about it? It's like heck man, he did a hell of a job," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said. "Can't say enough about him."	The Phillies could have clinched a playoff spot with a win and a St. Louis loss.	The major league-leading Phillies (94-49) remain 12 games ahead of Atlanta in the NL East and could wrap up their fifth straight division title as soon as Wednesday.	The Brewers entered last week with a 10 1/2-game lead over St. Louis. Milwaukee plays no one with a winning record the rest of the year beginning on Tuesday against Colorado.	"You're not going to play anybody tougher than the Phillies," Braun said. "I think this is the best team in the National League and the best team in baseball, and has been all year."	Milwaukee's seventh-inning rally started with a flare double by Hart. Morgan then lashed one of his own and stretched his arms high above his head as part of his "beast mode" celebration he helped begin with Fielder this season.	"He's been amazing for us all year," Braun said. "He's done a lot of things to really contribute on the field, I think people lose sight of that because of his creativity and personality, but he's really been a great player on the field. Without him tying the game right there, I don't even get an at-bat."	Braun hit a long fly ball off Worley that was barely foul in the right-field corner, then singled to right to give Milwaukee a 3-2 lead.	"It figured that it went foul," Braun said. "Fortunately, I was still able to come through and get a hit."	Victorino led off the sixth with his 16th homer after Gallardo had allowed just one hit -- a second-inning single to Howard -- up to that point.	Howard added his 33rd home run and NL-best 112th RBI to put Philadelphia ahead 2-1 even though Gallardo had struck out two or more batters in four different innings.	Brewers second baseman Rickie Weeks started for the first time since severely spraining his ankle on July 27. He scored Milwaukee's first run in the second on Jonathan Lucroy's groundout.	Worley worked around runners in scoring position in the first, third and fifth innings before the Brewers finally broke through against him in the seventh and held on from there.	"It's a good test. But when playoff time comes and October rolls around you throw all this out the door," Victorino said. "I don't think it's going to dictate what happens in October."	Game notes	 It was Gallardo's 13th game with at least 10 strikeouts, including three this season. ... Milwaukee has a day off before starting a two-game series with Colorado. RHP Zack Greinke (14-6, 3.93 ERA) will pitch Tuesday's opener followed by RHP Shaun Marcum (12-6, 3.25 ERA). ... The Phillies continue their seven-game road trip with a series with the Astros. RHP Roy Oswalt (7-8, 3.72 ERA) makes his return to Houston where he'll face former Philadelphia RHP Brett Myers (4-13, 4.66 ERA).	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ST. LOUIS --  Yadier Molina and the St. Louis Cardinals are back in the playoff picture.	Molina had three hits, including a three-run double, and the Cardinals beat the slumping Atlanta Braves 6-3 on Sunday to complete a three-game series sweep.	The Cardinals pulled within 4½ games of NL wild card-leading Atlanta and remained six games back of Central-leading Milwaukee They have 16 games left and open a three-game set in Pittsburgh on Monday.	The Braves start a three-game series with the Marlins on Monday and have 15 games remaining.	"I feel like we are (in the race) if we keep winning," St. Louis manager Tony La Russa said. "It's exciting baseball. Guys have come through all over the roster. We got a shot."	The Cardinals know they have left themselves no margin for error.	"It doesn't mean anything if you go and you don't have a good road trip," first baseman Albert Pujols said. "We're just going to continue playing and at the end of the road trip we'll see where we are."	Atlanta has dropped seven straight games at Busch Stadium and hasn't won in St. Louis since Sept. 13, 2009. The Braves lost six of eight on their road trip.	"We did nothing right," Braves star Chipper Jones said of the road stint.	Jake Westbrook (12-8) allowed two runs and five hits in 5 1/3 innings for the Cardinals. Jason Motte pitched a scoreless ninth for his fifth save in eight chances.	"It was a good win for us," Westbrook said. "I would have liked to have gotten deeper in the game and saved our bullpen a little bit but that just wasn't the case."	St. Louis got to Tim Hudson (14-10) for five runs in the third, taking advantage of a lapse in control by the right-hander. Hudson plunked Daniel Descalso leading off the inning, and hit Jon Jay with another pitch with two down, leaving runners on the corners.	Pujols hit an RBI single before Hudson issued consecutive walks to Matt Holliday and Lance Berkman, forcing home a run. Molina then cleared the bases with a double to right, making it 5-0.	Hudson was charged with six runs and eight hits in six innings.	"I made my bed," Hudson said. "I set them up for an inning and I just didn't make good pitches. They had good at-bats and made me pay for it."	Jones did hit a solo drive in the eighth for his 17th homer of the season and No. 453 for his career, moving him ahead of Carl Yastrzemski and into 33rd place. Freddie Freeman singled in a run for Atlanta, and pinch-hitter Matt Diaz had a sacrifice fly.	Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez said his team needs to regroup a bit after playing eight road games in seven days.	"It feels like we're close offensively," Gonzalez said. "Let's just go home, lick our wounds a little bit and go get them."	Game notes	 Cardinals starter Kyle Lohse (13-8) will oppose Brad Lincoln (1-2) on Monday in Pittsburgh. Brandon Beachy (7-2) will get the ball for the Braves on Monday in Atlanta. Chris Volstad (5-12) is scheduled to pitch for the Marlins. ... Freeman's RBI was his 71st, tops among all rookies. ... Pujols went 13 for 36 on the Cardinals' nine-game homestand to raise his average to .297.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  C.J. Wilson understood why Texas manager Ron Washington wouldn't give him a shot at his second consecutive shutout.	Wilson scattered five singles over eight shutout innings, Adrian Beltre homered twice to reach 301 for his career and the AL West-leading Rangers beat Oakland 8-1 on Sunday to eliminate the Athletics from playoff contention.	Wilson (16-6) struck out 11 and walked one, following up on his first career shutout -- an 8-0 win at Tampa Bay last Tuesday.	Wilson set a career high for victories and wanted a complete game, but Washington pulled his ace after 111 pitches.	Washington is trying to avoid extra stress on Wilson's left arm down the stretch, and Wilson agreed with his manager to take a long-term approach and stay in the dugout with an 8-0 lead.	"He understands," Washington said. "He's the guy in our rotation who's going every fifth day."	Wilson threw an assortment of pitches to a lineup that included late-season call-ups and reserves.	"I threw six different pitches," Wilson said. "All of them were good. A high fastball, a sinker, a sidearm fastball that I used the last couple of innings, my curve and slider were good and my changeup. You can't just go out there and throw heaters; they'll figure that out."	Beltre was the offensive star with four hits while Craig Gentry and Ian Kinsler added three apiece for the Rangers, who have taken 10 of their last 11 from the A's this season.	Beltre has seven homers in his last eight games against Oakland and 15 RBIs against the A's this season.	Commenting on reaching 300 career homers, Beltre said, "It means I've been playing for a long time. I'm proud of that. It's something not many guys can do."	Eric Sogard homered against Koji Uehara leading off the ninth to end the shutout bid.	The Rangers extended their division lead over second-place Los Angeles to 2½ games when the Angels were beaten by the New York Yankees 6-5.	Josh Outman (3-5) got a spot start for Oakland, replacing Rich Harden, whose turn in the rotation was pushed back to give him extra rest. Outman allowed four runs and eight hits over 4 2/3 innings.	Outman, whose previous three appearances came in relief, was making his ninth start of the season, first since July 2.	The Rangers broke up a scoreless game in the fifth when Gentry led off with his first career triple and Kinsler drove him in with a single.	Kinsler advanced to second on his 23rd straight stolen base, tying his club record, moved to third on a groundout and scored on Josh Hamilton's sacrifice fly.	Michael Young reached on an infield single and Beltre followed with a two-run homer to left field. Beltre also doubled in the second to extend his hitting streak to 16 games.	"It's always a good-hitting lineup, especially in this park, no matter what nine they throw out there," Outman said. "I battled through the first four innings, then in the fifth I was a little leg-weary. I felt like every mistake I made, they capitalized on."	Beltre led off the seventh against Andrew Carignan with his 23rd homer for his 22nd career multihomer game.	Later in the seventh, Gentry and Elvis Andrus had RBI singles to make it 7-0.	Game notes	 Wilson fell one short of matching his career high for strikeouts. He has six games of 10 or more strikeouts this season, the most for the Rangers since Nolan Ryan's six in 1991. ... Beltre is the 13th active player with 300 homers and 2,000 hits. ... The A's called up OF Jai Miller from Triple-A Sacramento and had him in the starting lineup. Miller spent the season with Sacramento, batting .276 with 32 homers and 88 RBIs in 110 games. He was acquired by Oakland off waivers in April from Kansas City. ... X-rays showed no fracture in Oakland OF Coco Crisp's lower leg injury. He was out of the lineup for the second consecutive day, and Crisp probably won't play in the home series against the Angels from Monday to Wednesday. ... Oakland 1B Brandon Allen is in an 0-for-18 slide. He was hitless in three at-bats, all strikeouts against Wilson.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DENVER --  As expected, Drew Pomeranz was quite nervous in his major league debut.	Only, not on the mound, but with a bat in his hands in his one and only plate appearance.	Even then, Pomeranz was a success, laying down a perfect sacrifice bunt. It was just that kind of day for the prized prospect.	Pomeranz threw five shutout innings and Ty Wigginton homered, helping the Colorado Rockies to a 4-1 win over the Cincinnati Reds on Sunday.	Pomeranz (1-0) was a key piece in the deal that sent ace Ubaldo Jimenez to Cleveland at the trade deadline. He showed exactly why the Rockies coveted him, allowing just two singles.	And there were hardly any traces of nerves, either, even as he glanced around expansive Coors Field.	"I try not to think about that when I'm on the mound," Pomeranz said with a casual shrug. "Mentally, I took it as any other game."	The lefty threw only 63 pitches before leaving in the fifth. He is three weeks removed from an emergency appendectomy and is still building up his arm strength.	Jason Hammel, a starter turned reliever, pitched four innings to earn his first save of the season.	Pomeranz hasn't pitched in many games since he was acquired in the five-player deal with the Indians in late July. Because a drafted player can't be traded within a year of his signing, Pomeranz wasn't allowed to join the Rockies organization until Aug. 17.	Instead, he threw off a mound in Arizona to keep his arm sharp. He made his first start for Double-A Tulsa on Aug. 17, throwing seven scoreless innings.	A few days later, he underwent an appendectomy that slowed his promotion to the big leagues.	Upon his return last week, Pomeranz threw three scoreless innings for Tulsa before having his contract selected by the Rockies on Sunday.	Although Pomeranz wasn't overpowering, he kept the Reds off balance with an effective changeup and a 91 mph fastball.	And when Pomeranz found himself in trouble early, he wiggled free by getting the Reds to ground into double plays in the second and third innings.	This was precisely the type of performance Rockies manager Jim Tracy envisioned from Pomeranz. Tracy caught a glimpse of him during spring training and was instantly intrigued, even asking around about the pitcher who was hitting 95 mph with his fastball.	"That's how much he jumped out at me," Tracy said.	After the game, Tracy said he was impressed with Pomeranz's ability to stay within the moment and not get rattled.	"I see a very, very slow heartbeat," Tracy said. "It's very encouraging to see."	Edinson Volquez (5-5) was effective in his first start since July 5, not allowing a hit until Wigginton's homer to left in the fourth. Volquez later gave up an RBI single to Jordan Pacheco.	Volquez, Cincinnati's opening-day starter, has bounced around between the Reds and Triple-A Louisville this season in an effort to find his command.	The right-hander had difficulty locating his breaking ball against Colorado as he walked four and struck out three.	"Today, I was trying to throw my curve and it didn't break like I wanted," Volquez said.	Still, it was a step in the right direction.	"He had good tempo," Reds manager Dusty Baker said. "He threw the ball better."	Chris Valaika had both hits off Pomeranz before leaving in the fifth with a strained right knee. Chris Heisey had a triple in the seventh and Joey Votto homered in the ninth to provide the only other hits for the Reds as the team wrapped up a 4-5 road trip.	The banged-up Rockies went with a patchwork lineup, with All-Star shortstop Troy Tulowitzki (sore hip), first baseman Todd Helton (stiff back) and second baseman Mark Ellis (neck) all sitting out.	Just before the game, Carlos Gonzalez also was scratched with lower back stiffness and Wigginton went in to play left field.	With an off day Monday, Tracy said he's hopeful Tulowitzki will be back in the lineup Tuesday in Milwaukee.	Starting in place of Tulowitzki was Thomas Field, who made his major league debut after having his contract selected from Tulsa. He drew a walk his first time up but finished without a hit.	But this will be a day remembered for the debut of Pomeranz.	"He's really good," Gonzalez said. "He's our future."	Game notes	 Players and coaches for the Rockies and Reds held a giant American flag in the infield during a tribute to honor the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. ... The Reds will start LHP Dontrelle Willis on Monday against the Chicago Cubs. ... Cincinnati 2B Brandon Phillips was given the day off. ... Rockies 2B Eric Young Jr. had three stolen bases.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Mariano Rivera made his 1,036th appearance with a catcher making his major league debut. Rivera earned his 599th career save with help from Austin Romine, who was shopping in a store in Kentucky 24 hours earlier.	Although injuries and slumps have forced the New York Yankees to get resourceful -- and a little lucky -- in the last few weeks, they're still leaving California with their biggest AL East lead of the season.	Robinson Cano and Curtis Granderson homered, New York scored two key runs when Peter Bourjos dropped a fly ball in the seventh inning, and the Yankees beat the Los Angeles Angels 6-5 Sunday to snap a four-game skid.	"We got a little bit lucky today," said Rivera, who moved two saves behind Trevor Hoffman's major league career record. "That's part of the game, but we won."	Derek Jeter had two hits and scored the go-ahead run for the Yankees, who moved 3½ games ahead of slumping Boston in the division standings.	The Yankees' four-game skid was their second-longest this season, but they still haven't lost four straight road games all year. New York also avoided getting swept by the Angels for the first time since July 2009.	The Yankees might be stumbling a bit -- but compared to the Red Sox, who were pounded again by Tampa Bay on Sunday, they're rolling.	"We've lost a lot of tough games," said Mark Teixeira, who hit the decisive fly to Bourjos. "We're beat up, very tired, but ... we needed a break like that. We've been through a lot lately, and for us to scratch this one out, we could smell it. Once we got that lead, we weren't going to give it back."	New York had two runners on in the seventh when Bourjos -- normally an outstanding fielder -- was blinded by the sun just long enough for Teixeira's fly to deep center to simply pop out of his glove. Bourjos then missed the cutoff man with his throw, allowing Jeter to score easily from first base on the error.	"It kind of flashed into the sun for a second, but it's a play I've got to make," Bourjos said. "I think I needed to get in a little better position to catch it. It was a turning point in that game, and we lost it right there."	Howie Kendrick and Bourjos hit two-run homers for the Angels, who dropped 2½ games behind AL West-leading Texas.	Both teams participated in a pregame ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks. Former Yankees manager Joe Torre was on the field while Jeter, Jorge Posada and Rivera caught ceremonial first pitches from two first responders and a survivor in the attacks on New York and Washington.	"I wish we were at home with the people of New York," Posada said.	Rivera earned his 40th save of the season. The Yankees play six more road games before returning to New York on Sept. 19.	Romine made an unlikely debut one day after getting a call from manager Joe Girardi, a week after his minor league season concluded.	Romine, who grew up 10 minutes from Angel Stadium in Lake Forest, came on in the seventh inning for fellow catching prospect Jesus Montero. Romine played in front of more than 20 family members -- including Angels infielder Andrew Romine, his older brother.	"It's a tremendous honor to catch (Rivera)," said Romine, the fifth catcher used by New York in four days. "I've played in this ballpark before, so there's a comfort level."	Cory Wade (5-0) pitched the sixth inning for New York after Freddy Garcia scuffled through the first five, allowing five runs and seven hits.	Injuries are piling up during a 10-game trip for the Yankees, who played their second straight game without Alex Rodriguez and their third in a row without right fielder Nick Swisher. Rodriguez won't return until at least Tuesday while resting a sore left thumb, while Swisher has tendinitis in his left elbow.	Catchers Francisco Cervelli and Russell Martin both sat out to rest injuries incurred earlier this week, and Posada said he was a bit sore after catching Saturday for the first time all season.	Ervin Santana (11-11) couldn't match the shutdown efforts of Jered Weaver and Dan Haren earlier in the series despite eight strikeouts for the Angels, yielding eight hits and four walks before leaving with two runners on in the sixth.	Erick Aybar had four hits for the Angels, who completed a 6-3 homestand. Los Angeles had pulled within 1 1/2 games of Texas on Saturday, but the Rangers routed Oakland 8-1 earlier Sunday.	"We shot ourselves in the foot all day on the offensive side," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "We had chances to score runners with just some outs, and we left a lot of guys on third base with less than two outs. You need to pick up those runs and keep pressure on them. We just didn't play the kind of all-around type of game that's going to lead to a win."	Game notes	 Granderson's two-run homer in the fifth was the 39th of his remarkable season. ... Angels DH Bobby Abreu stole two bases, giving him 20 steals for the 13th consecutive season. That's the longest streak in the majors since Rickey Henderson had 23 straight seasons of 20 steals from 1979-2001. ... Aybar got the Angels' major league-leading 39th bunt hit in the third inning with a perfect bunt down the third-base line. Aybar and Bourjos account for the majority of Los Angeles' bunt hits.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Madison Bumgarner didn't have much problem handling the Los Angeles Dodgers while stopping another losing streak for the Giants.	Convincing manager Bruce Bochy to let him finish out the season may be a bit more difficult.	San Francisco's most reliable starter over the last three weeks, Bumgarner has already logged more than 186 innings on the mound this season. With their postseason hopes dimming almost every day, the Giants plan to take a cautious approach the rest of the way with their young left-hander.	"We had a little concern, not much, with how much he pitched the year before," Bochy said after Bumgarner allowed three hits over five innings in San Francisco's 7-1 win Sunday. "I just like where he's at right now. He worked hard today but made some great pitches."	Bumgarner won his fourth straight start, Pablo Sandoval doubled home the go-ahead run in the fifth inning and the Giants beat the Dodgers to avoid a three-game sweep.	Bumgarner (11-12) struck out eight and walked three, matching the longest winning streak of his career and improving to 8-3 with a 2.73 ERA since June 26.	"I'm just making better pitches and having a little better luck at the same time," Bumgarner said while insisting his arm strength is fine despite closing in on the 200-inning mark.	"I don't know if I've gotten stronger. I still feel good. I'm not worried about wins and losses for me. The biggest thing is innings. You want to stay out there and pitch late. That's probably the most important thing."	Six of Bumgarner's victories, including each of the last four, have come after Giants losses.	It's probably too little too late for the defending World Series champions, who snapped a three-game losing streak and trail NL West-leading Arizona by 8½ games. When San Francisco scored two runs in the fifth and five in the sixth, it marked the first time since July 3 that the Giants scored multiple runs in consecutive innings.	Slumping Aubrey Huff had two hits and a bases-loaded walk in his first start since Monday. Sandoval finished with a career-high three doubles, tying a Giants regular-season record at AT&T Park.	"It seems to be starting a little late," Huff said. "You could tell when we got a three-run lead, everyone relaxed and we started scoring more."	Tony Gwynn Jr. doubled in the Dodgers' run but struck out with the potential tying run at second base in the sixth. Los Angeles lost for only the third time in 13 games.	San Francisco had gone 18 consecutive scoreless innings until breaking through against starter Hiroki Kuroda, who had not lost in four previous appearances at the Giants.	Sandoval drove in Jeff Keppinger for a 2-1 lead in the fifth and Huff followed with an RBI single on an 0-2 pitch. In a 5-for-36 (.139) slump coming in, Huff also walked with the bases loaded against Scott Elbert during a five-run sixth.	In the second, Huff doubled leading off after initially thinking he had a home run. The ball hit the top of the fence and bounced back onto the field, but second base umpire John Hirschbeck ruled the ball was still in play. Umpires upheld the call following a video review.	It was reminiscent of San Francisco's win over Texas in Game 2 of the World Series last year when the Rangers' Ian Kinsler hit a ball to almost the same spot as Huff did. Kinsler was also given a double on the play.	Three batters later, Eli Whiteside singled in Huff with San Francisco's first run.	"I was touching first and everybody thought it was a homer," Huff said. "I'm like, 'Homer? I hit it high enough to get out?' I scored, so it's kind of a moot point."	Kuroda (11-16) allowed three runs and eight hits in 4 2/3 innings, his shortest outing since getting only 12 outs against San Diego on Aug. 2 last year.	"For the most part it looks like he isn't able to locate like he usually does," Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said. "Everybody is entitled to this kind of stretch. He's not going to cave in. It's not like he's missing with everything."	Cody Ross hit a bases-loaded double and pinch hitter Mark De Rosa added a two-run single in the sixth.	Los Angeles scored its lone run in the second and had a chance for more with the bases loaded before Bumgarner worked his way out of it. He got Kuroda to ground into a force play at home then retired Dee Gordon on a comebacker.	The Dodgers managed only four runners the rest of the way and ended their trip 7-3.	Game notes	 A moment of silence was held before the game to commemorate the victims of 9/11. There was no ceremonial first pitch; instead, Bochy walked out to the field alone and left a ball on the pitching mound. ... The previous San Francisco player to have three doubles in one home game was Nate Schierholtz on Sept. 24, 2008. ... The Giants activated LHP Barry Zito from the 15-day DL. Bochy plans to use Zito as a spot starter and out of the bullpen. ... Eric Surkamp (1-0) pitches for San Francisco in the series opener against San Diego on Monday. The rookie lefty beat the Padres on Sept. 6 for his only career win in the majors. ... Dodgers LHP Ted Lilly (9-13), who tied his season high of nine strikeouts in his previous start, will pitch for Los Angeles in the opener of a three-game set with Arizona.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SEATTLE --  Everett Teaford's first major league victory was worth the wait. It also came in his first big league start.	The Kansas City Royals rookie left-hander, who labored five seasons in the minors, took advantage of his first start Sunday against the Seattle Mariners, allowing three hits in five scoreless innings in a 2-1 victory.	He struck out a career-high five with one walk, Alex Gordon supported him with a pair of RBI doubles and three Royals relievers combined to finish off the victory.	Blake Wood took over in the seventh and tossed two hitless innings, retiring six straight, four on strikeouts. Greg Holland gave up a two-out RBI double to Ichiro Suzuki in the eighth and Joakim Soria pitched the ninth to pick up his 28th save in 35 opportunities.	"It's unreal," Teaford said. "To have my 100th (professional) start my first big-league start and my first win of my career, and my dad here. ... It's awesome to have him in town. You can't write a better story than that."	Teaford, the Royals' 12th round draft choice in 2006, was recalled from Triple-A Omaha on May 17. He had a 3.21 ERA in 23 appearances out of the bullpen without a decision.	Having come through the system as a starter, Teaford was eager to get one. Manager Ned Yost told him Saturday that he would get the ball Sunday.	"I think he did very, very well, five shutout innings," Yost said. "After that first inning (23 pitches), I thought we'd be lucky to get three out of him. Then he kind of settled down and did a good job getting through five.	"I did everything I could to at least give him the opportunity to get his first big league win. I didn't want him going much more than 75 pitches. He did it. And the bullpen did an outstanding job from that point on."	Kansas City got a break in the third inning when Alcides Escobar stroked a two-out single to left and Gordon lifted a routine fly to Mike Carp. The left fielder battled to track the ball in the sun, finally losing it to his right.	Escobar never broke stride, scoring without a throw and Gordon was credited with a RBI double.	"That sun ball, things finally went our way," Gordon said. "Escobar did a good job running that ball out."	Anthony Vasquez (1-3), who entered with a 9.00 ERA in his three previous starts for the Mariners, went six-plus innings -- his longest career outing -- allowing seven hits, two runs with two strikeouts and no walks.	"He's different from other guys," Gordon said of Vasquez. "He's got a soft change, soft curveball. He only throws 88 (mph), but with his soft stuff it looks a lot harder. He just mixed it up well. He's different from the guys you usually see. We had a tough time with him."	Vasquez put down a couple of minor threats in the middle innings. In the fifth with one out, he hit Chris Getz and Escobar followed with a single to center. He then struck out Gordon and Melky Cabrera lined out to center when Casper Wells made a nice sliding catch.	In the sixth, Eric Hosmer launched a one-out double into the right-center gap, but Jeff Francoeur popped out to second and Yamaico Navarro bounced out to short.	Vasquez, however, couldn't escape a self-induced jam in the seventh. Brayan Pena opened with a single to center and then Getz laid down a sacrifice bunt. Vasquez booted it, putting runners on first and second with no outs.	Shawn Kelley took over and struck out Escobar when he failed to put down a bunt with two strikes. Gordon followed with his second double, a shot against the left-center wall. Pena scored but Getz held up at third and Kelley got out of the jam without more damage.	Gordon leads the majors with 45 doubles.	The Royals displayed their defensive prowess in the fourth. With Dustin Ackley on first, Carp lined out to Francoeur in right. He quickly threw to first to double off Ackley.	It was the Royals' 50th outfield assist, most in the majors. It also was the most in the big leagues since 2002 and three short of the club record.	Game notes	 Seattle hosts the AL East-leading New York Yankees for three games beginning Monday. The Mariners will start their ace, RH Felix Hernandez (14-11, 3.15), Monday, followed by lefties Charlie Furbush (3-8, 4.84) and Jason Vargas (8-13, 4.49). The Yankees have a 2½ game lead over Boston. Hernandez is 6-3 with a 2.82 ERA in 10 career starts against the Yankees. ... The Royals have Monday off before beginning a six-game homestand against Minnesota and the Chicago White Sox. Bruce Chen (10-7, 4.30) takes the mound. He is 1-4 with a 6.59 ERA in 15 career starts against the Twins. ... Royals DH Billy Butler singled in the fourth to break a 0-for-17 slide. ... The Mariners struck out 12 times. In the four-game series, Royals pitchers struck out 51 Mariners. ... RH Steve Delabar made his big league debut for the Mariners in the ninth. He is the 12th player to debut this season for Seattle.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PHOENIX --  The San Diego Padres have struggled all year long, especially in Arizona. So this one was particularly sweet.	Nick Hundley homered and the Padres held on for a 7-6 victory Sunday that snapped the Diamondbacks' franchise-record home winning streak at 15 games.	Hundley, Jesus Guzman and James Darnell had two RBIs apiece for the Padres, who ended a three-game losing streak and won for just the second time in seven games.	"Anytime you can come out of here with a win you consider it to be a good day," San Diego starter Wade LeBlanc.	San Diego had lost seven of eight games in Arizona this season, including the first three games of the series.	"We've got to stay positive," said Heath Bell, who pitched the ninth for his 37th save in 42 chances one day after allowing two homers in the ninth. "We could have taken three out of four. I messed up yesterday and the second game we kinda blew it."	LeBlanc (3-5) went 5 2/3 innings and allowed four runs and four hits while snapping a personal three-game losing streak.	"I thought he deserved to get the win," Padres manager Bud Black said. "He had good efficiency, mix of pitches and changing of speeds, which all go into Wade's game."	Henry Blanco homered and Chris Young added a two-run double for the NL West-leading Diamondbacks. Arizona's lead over the San Francisco Giants slipped to 8½ games and its magic number remained eight.	"You'd like to win them all but we didn't today," manager Kirk Gibson said. "We push through. There's a saying about playing 27 outs, playing to the end. It's something that's been preached for a while. It's part of their character."	Backed by LeBlanc's one-hit pitching over the first five innings, San Diego built a 7-0 lead against Josh Collmenter (9-9).	Darnell drove in Hundley with a single in the second, then hit a sacrifice fly in the third. Guzman had an RBI single and Anthony Rizzo drew a bases-loaded walk in the third to put the Padres ahead 4-0.	Hundley hit a two-run shot in the fifth for his eighth homer, giving San Diego a 6-0 lead and ending Collmenter's day. Guzman added a run-scoring double in the seventh.	Then the Diamondbacks made things interesting.	Blanco, Arizona's regular Sunday catcher, led off the sixth with a line drive over the wall in left. Reliever Zach Duke singled to center, Gerardo Parra reached on a one-out single and Paul Goldschmidt walked to load the bases and chase LeBlanc.	Young hit a two-run double to left off Erik Hamren, and Collin Cowgill brought home Goldschmidt and Young with a single to center that trimmed San Diego's lead to 7-5.	"We got it the hard way," Black said. "It looked as though we might have done it the easy way but it turned out to be the hard way."	The Diamondbacks pulled within one in the seventh when Blanco singled, went to second when pinch hitter Geoff Blum was hit by a pitch and scored on pinch hitter Justin Upton's groundout.	"It's been our team all year," Collmenter said. "Up, down, we play all the way through. It's fun to be a part of a team like that and know that no matter how far down you are, they're going to battle and give you a chance to win."	Collmenter gave up six runs and seven hits, walked three and struck out two.	"I think I forced through some things," Collmenter said. "I didn't make some big pitches when I needed to. I left some balls up over the plate today and they were able to put the bat on."	Game notes	 Arizona's last home loss was on August 8, a 9-1 defeat against the Houston Astros. The Diamondbacks won the next three games of the series to begin a seven-game winning streak. ... Darnell has driven in five runs in his past two games. ... Young stole second in the second inning to reach the 20-homer, 20-stolen base plateau for the third time in his career. . The Padres dropped their formal protest of the Diamondbacks' 6-5, extra-inning victory on Saturday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK -- Jason Bay and the New York Mets missed several opportunities to provide a special ending to a moving night.	It was hard to complain about the outcome, though.	Carlos Pena hit a go-ahead single in Chicago's six-run 11th inning, and the Cubs beat New York 10-6 on Sunday night in a game that ended nearly five hours after the Mets held a touching ceremony to mark the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11.	"It was a little bit different today. Obviously, you could tell the atmosphere was a little bit different. But I think most of us have played in emotional games or seesaw games before," Bay said. "It was actually fun because it was different. Obviously, not fun losing. We had chances but it was pretty special to be a part of."	The Mets' disappointing finish came with nearly all of the 33,502 fans -- several thousand first responders and their families receiving free tickets -- long gone from a game that started at 8:20 p.m. There was a 24-minute pregame tribute to victims of the attacks, their families and many of the first responders that worked tirelessly at the World Trade Center site in 2001.	Making just his sixth big league appearance, Josh Stinson (0-1), the Mets' seventh of nine pitchers, walked Marlon Byrd to start the 11th and gave up a single to Bryan LaHair. Pena singled for the lead.	Pinch-hitter Alfonso Soriano and Darwin Barney each hit two-run doubles off Ryota Igarashi before the first out, and Geovany Soto added a sacrifice fly.	"You keep grinding and grinding," Pena said. "It's not easy."	New York trailed 4-1 after five innings but scored twice in the sixth off Matt Garza. The Mets tied it with an unearned run when reliever Jeff Samardzija made a bad throw on Justin Turner's infield single.	The Mets loaded the bases in the first, ninth and 10th innings but came up empty each time. Ramon Ortiz (1-2) got David Wright to pop out to end the 10th before the Cubs went ahead in the 11th, eliciting mocking calls from the few remaining to bring in an experienced pitcher when Stinson gave up the go-ahead hit to Pena.	"As we went through the ballgame, we had the guys at home plate we wanted to have at home plate several times," Mets manager Terry Collins said. "But we didn't get it done."	The mood was much different before the game. With the stadium lights dimmed and fans holding electronic candles in one hand and many using the other to take photos with their phones, the Mets held a dignified ceremony that included members of the 2001 team that played in the first professional sporting event in New York, 10 days after the World Trade center collapsed.	Players from the Cubs and Mets escorted members of "Tuesday's Children," a charity for families affected by the attacks, onto the field, where they lined up among the uniformed emergency-service workers on the first- and third-base lines. A 100-by-300 foot flag was held by 225 first responders and victims' family members from "Tuesday's Children."	"It was really, really well done," Collins said. "Even Mike Piazza, standing next to me, said, 'Boy, isn't this beautiful out here. What a nice tribute.' I think he's absolutely right."	Marc Anthony sang the national anthem, as he did on Sept. 21, 2001. Piazza, who hit a rousing two-run homer in the eighth inning to help the Mets beat the Atlanta Braves that night, caught a ceremonial first pitch from John Franco, a teammate on the 2001 squad.	There was no uplifting ending this time for New York.	The Cubs scored late in each of the three games, losing the opener Friday, but winning the last two to take their first series in New York since 2006.	"We don't do things the easy way, that's for sure," Cubs manager Mike Quade said. "They kept playing, they kept battling."	Mets players briefly considered defying Major League Baseball's policy by wearing the caps they wore pregame honoring New York City's emergency-service units during the game.	"What are they going to do, fine us?" catcher Josh Thole said before deciding against it.	Joe Torre, MLB's executive vice president for baseball operations, told The Associated Press the decision was made to keep policy consistent throughout baseball and that "certainly, it's not a lack of respect."	Between innings, the Mets played videos on the main scoreboard that paid tribute to the recovery efforts. They also thanked the 2001 squad's manager Bobby Valentine, who was not able to participate in the pregame ceremony because he was part of the ESPN broadcast team for the game.	American Idol contestant Pia Toscano sang "God Bless America" during the seventh-inning stretch, standing with several uniformed first responders around Major League Baseball's red, white and blue logo that was painted on the grass in front of the Mets dugout.	Mets starter Miguel Batista was with the World Series champion Arizona Diamondbacks in 2001, and made two appearances in the stirring series against the New York Yankees that inspired the city. He threw 7 2/3 shutout innings in Game 5, won by New York in the 12th inning. He also got one out in Game 7.	On Sunday, though, the 40-year-old journeyman, making his third start for the Mets, struggled with his command. He walked three in five innings, hit two batters in the third and gave up four runs and five hits.	Garza gave up three runs in seven runs, walking three and striking out four.	Jason Pridie hit a two-run shot in the 11th.	Game notes	 Mets reliever Bobby Parnell said his dad, a fire chief in Salsbury, N.C., recently received a piece of steel from the World Trade Center site that will be used in a memorial. ... Quade, who was a coach with the Oakland Athletics when they played the Yankees in the 2001 playoffs, deliberately didn't visit the site on this trip. "I did not want to get angry again," he said. ... Mets LHP Johan Santana will make his third rehab start this week for Class-A Savannah in the South Atlantic League's championship series. He threw three innings in his previous start for Savannah. Collins said he should pitch four innings this time.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BALTIMORE --  B.J. Upton was far more delighted with a victory than etching his name in the Tampa Bay record book -- twice.	Upton doubled twice and took two walks to set a team mark by reaching base in nine straight plate appearances, and the resurgent Rays beat the Baltimore Orioles 5-2 on Monday night for their fifth straight victory.	Upton went 4 for 4 with a walk on Sunday against Boston, then reached base four successive times against the Orioles before striking out in the eighth inning. Eight times previously a Tampa Bay player got on base in eight straight plate appearances, the last one being Upton in May 2008.	The two walks made Upton the Rays' career leader with 375. Carlos Pena held the record with 373.	Upton was pleased with his accomplishment, only because it contributed to Tampa Bay's eighth win in nine games. The Rays moved within three games of idle Boston in the AL wild-card race after trailing by nine on Sept. 2.	"I just want to help this team whether it's offensively or defensively, and right now it happens to be on the offensive end," Upton said. "I feel good right now, and I'll just try to feel good as long as I can. The hits are just falling."	And manager Joe Maddon is loving it.	"That's pretty impressive. He's getting good at-bats," Maddon said. "He's been taking his walks and when they come in the zone he's hitting it. He's been fantastic, he's been really high-end of late, maybe as good as I've seen him. He's playing with a lot of focus and intensity."	Ben Zobrist had three hits and three RBIs for the Rays and Jeff Niemann (10-7) gave up two runs and six hits in 7 2/3 innings. Neimann's previous outing, a defeat against Texas on Sept. 6, was Tampa Bay's lone loss in nine games.	Joel Peralta worked the ninth for his third save.	After playing Baltimore twice more, the Rays head to Boston for a four-game series. They would love to arrive at Fenway Park down by three games or fewer.	"It will be more exciting," Peralta said.	The victory assured the Rays (82-64) of their fourth consecutive winning season. Only the New York Yankees (19), Red Sox (14) and Philadelphia Phillies (9) have a longer current streak.	But Tampa Bay is looking for more, such as its third playoff appearance in four years.	"There's nothing to complain about right now," Maddon said. "We've worked ourselves back into a good spot."	Matt Wieters homered for the Orioles, who have dropped three straight. Baltimore needs to go 5-11 the rest of the way to avoid the third 100-loss season since the team moved from St. Louis in 1954.	Rookie starter Zach Britton (9-10) gave up five runs, five hits and four walks in five innings. He was 3-0 in his last four starts.	"It starts and stops with fastball command," manager Buck Showalter said. "That's one of the reasons Tampa is doing a good job with their starters. They have guys with good command of the fastball. Zach didn't have it tonight."	The Rays went up 3-0 in the third. Brandon Guyer doubled and Upton walked before Zobrist hit a two-run double and scored on a two-out single by Sean Rodriguez.	Upton hit a leadoff double in the fifth and scored on a sacrifice fly by Johnny Damon for a 4-0 lead.	Robert Andino doubled in a run for Baltimore in the bottom half, and Wieters hit his 18th homer in the sixth.	Upton doubled off Jeremy Accardo leading off the seventh and Zobrist delivered an RBI single.	Game notes	 The Rays have won 22 straight when scoring at least five runs. ... Tampa Bay purchased the contract of LHP Matt Moore from Triple-A Durham, giving the Rays 32 players on the active roster. ... Baltimore activated RHP Jason Berken (forearm strain) from the 15-day DL. ... Tampa Bay is 6-1 in Baltimore and 3-6 against the Orioles at home. ... The Rays send 12-game winner David Price to the mound Tuesday night against Baltimore's Alfredo Simon, who is 1-0 lifetime in five appearances against Tampa Bay.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PITTSBURGH --  Little-used Pedro Ciriaco became the most unlikely of opponents to damage the St. Louis Cardinals' playoff chances.	Ciriaco hit a tiebreaking double to cap a three-run rally in the eighth inning and the Pittsburgh Pirates stunned St. Louis 6-5 on Monday night, snapping the Cardinals' season-high five-game winning streak.	"It's just a great feeling for him ... after all the challenges he's had this year," Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said of Ciriaco, sent back and forth from the minors six times this season. "I think there was a point of time when he had more flights (to Triple-A) than at-bats and we were trying to equal that out.	"He just battled. ... It was a really good moment for him personally and for our club."	Albert Pujols hit his NL-leading 35th homer and drove in three runs for St. Louis, which had won five in a row to climb within 4½ games of Atlanta for the NL wild card. The Cardinals also began the day six games behind first-place Milwaukee in the NL Central.	St. Louis built a 4-3 lead against fourth-place Pittsburgh but lost for the seventh time this season when leading after seven innings.	"We weren't going to go (16-0 the rest of the season)," Cardinals outfielder Lance Berkman said. "The most important thing for us is to worry about winning series. If we win this series, then we've done our job.	"We still have that in front of us. We can win the series. It's unrealistic to say we've got to go 7-0 on this road trip. That probably wasn't going to happen. This wasn't a death knell by any means."	Ryan Doumit, back in the lineup a day after he sustained a chest bruise, tied it at 4 in the eighth with an RBI double off Marc Rzepczynski (0-2). With the bases loaded and two outs, the light-hitting Ciriaco hit a liner down the right-field line off Fernando Salas for a two-run double and a 6-4 lead.	Ciriaco had 23 career at-bats over two seasons coming into the game and had struck out on three pitches in the seventh. He had 17 at-bats this season and three times had stints of three days or fewer with Pittsburgh.	Once last month, Ciriaco was in the airport heading for a seventh trip back to Triple-A before a last-minute injury summoned him back to the ballpark.	"It was a good feeling for me, especially to win the game," Ciriaco said. "When you're here, you want to stay here. You don't want to go down. I'm just trying to be more consistent and to be here and stay here."	Joel Hanrahan gave up a run in the ninth but held on for his 37th save, snapping Pittsburgh's three-game skid. With runners at second and third, the All-Star closer struck out pinch-hitter Corey Patterson to end it with Pujols on deck.	Neil Walker went 3 for 4 with an RBI and Alex Presley had two hits and scored two runs for the Pirates, two defeats shy of guaranteeing a 19th straight losing season.	Jason Grilli (2-1) worked a perfect eighth for the win.	"We gave them a chance to come back, and they came back and beat us," Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said.	Pujols' home run off Brad Lincoln after Jon Jay led off the sixth with a single gave the Cardinals their only lead. It was the 443rd homer of his career, moving him into sole possession of 37th place.	Pujols has hit safely in 10 of 11 games played this month and has four homers in his past 12 games. It was his third home run in seven games this season at PNC Park, his 29th career homer there -- most of any opposing player at the 11-year-old stadium and the most for him at any park not in St. Louis.	But the Cardinals' bullpen deprived Kyle Lohse of his sixth win in his past seven decisions and of the opportunity to improve to 8-2 in his career against the Pirates. Lohse allowed three runs on eight hits and a walk with three strikeouts.	Lincoln entered having allowed seven runs in four starts since permanently being put into the rotation Aug. 22. He endured his worst outing of the season, allowing four runs (three earned) on eight hits and two walks in 5 1/3 innings.	Pujols also had a sacrifice fly in the first, and Andrew McCutchen and Derrek Lee hit sacrifice flies in the bottom of the inning.	"It's a tough one," Lohse said, "but we've just got to come back and win the series. That's all we can do now."	Game notes	 Pittsburgh has had a starter pitch more than six innings only once in its past 21 games. ... St. Louis' most recent six-game winning streak in September came in 2008. ... The Cardinals are closing in on agreeing to a $21 million, two-year contract with RHP Chris Carpenter, who will start Tuesday. He is 12-3 lifetime against the Pirates but 1-2 in four starts this season. ... RHP Jeff Karstens will start for Pittsburgh, his first outing since Aug. 28 at St. Louis. He had his past two starts skipped due to shoulder stiffness.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

ATLANTA --  The Braves believe they're still in great shape to make the playoffs, even though they're struggling to protect their NL wild-card lead.	Mike Stanton's pinch-hit single in the 12th inning drove in the go-ahead run and the Florida Marlins beat Atlanta 5-4 on Monday night to extend the Braves' slump.	The Braves, coming off a 2-6 road trip, have lost four straight and nine of 12. They still lead St. Louis by 4½ games in the wild-card race.	"We're still in a good spot despite coming off a losing road trip and losing this one the way we did," said Brandon Beachy, who struck out 10, one shy of his career high, but gave up four runs and nine hits in 5 1/3 innings.	"We're still confident in our abilities," Beachy said.	"We've got a 4½-game lead with 14 left in the season. We should definitely make the playoffs and once that happens we can regroup and refocus and get things done."	The Braves had an assist from Pittsburgh, which beat St. Louis 6-5 on Monday night to keep the Cardinals from gaining ground in the wild-card race.	Manager Fredi Gonzalez said he's trying to "just keep talking to them and staying positive."	The Marlins have five more games left against Atlanta.	"If you don't get the opportunity to play in the playoffs, it's fun to see how we can affect the outcome," said Florida's Donnie Murphy.	Braves rookie right-hander Anthony Varvaro (0-2) walked John Buck to lead off the 12th. Pinch-runner Brett Hayes moved to second on Bryan Petersen's sacrifice before Varvaro issued an intentional walk to Murphy.	Stanton, held out of the starting lineup due to a strained right hamstring, lined a 1-2 pitch from Cristhian Martinez into left field to drive in Hayes.	Marlins manager Jack McKeon said he was tempted to use Stanton as a pinch-hitter earlier in the game.	"I tried to use him two or three times during the game," McKeon said. "I was debating."	The Marlins have won four straight.	Clay Hensley (4-6) pitched two scoreless innings for the win. Leo Nunez pitched the 12th for his 35th save.	The Braves couldn't score in the ninth after loading the bases with one out. Michael Bourn, who led off the inning with a double to the left-field wall, was stranded on third as Steve Cishek struck out Brian McCann on a called third strike before ending the threat on Martin Prado's groundout.	The frustrations continued when the Braves stranded runners in each of the next three innings. McCann struck out in the 11th with a runner on second.	"I came up twice with a chance to dictate the outcome and came up empty both times," McCann said, adding he had "two horrible at-bats."	Nunez walked Jason Heyward to lead off the 12th. Heyward moved to second on Jack Wilson's sacrifice. Nunez struck out pinch-hitter J.C. Boscan and ended the game on Bourn's grounder to second.	Alex Gonzalez, rejuvenated after a three-day break to rest his sore lower back, had three hits and drove in two runs, including a single off Edward Mujica in the eighth that drove in Heyward for a 4-4 tie.	Beachy gave up triples to Omar Infante in the first and Emilio Bonifacio in the third. Infante scored on Greg Dobbs' single and Bonifacio scored on Infante's fly ball as Florida took a 2-0 lead.	Dan Uggla singled and scored on a double by Gonzalez in the fourth. Bourn, who had an infield hit, scored on Freddie Freeman's fly ball to center in the fifth for a 2-2 tie.	Beachy walked Petersen with one out in the sixth before Murphy hit a pop fly that fell in shallow left-center for a single. With Petersen running from first on the pitch, Gonzalez, the shortstop, was breaking to second and couldn't recover in time to make the catch.	The Marlins took advantage of the break when Matt Dominguez drove in Petersen with a single up the middle, knocking Beachy out of the game. Dominguez scored on a wild pitch from Arodys Vizcaino to give Florida a 4-2 lead.	Prado hit a triple in the sixth and scored on Heyward's fly ball to trim the Marlins' lead to one run.	Chris Volstad gave up two runs and seven hits and a walk in five innings for Florida.	Game notes	 Florida was without its starting outfield for the third straight game. Manager Jack McKeon said LF Logan Morrison (bruised left knee) will miss the series. Morrison was having an MRI on the knee on Monday. McKeon said CF Mike Cameron (strained right hamstring) could pinch-hit. ... Braves RHP Tommy Hanson, on the disabled list with right shoulder tendinitis, said he had normal soreness after throwing in the bullpen for the first time in St. Louis. He is set for another bullpen session on Wednesday. ... Two rookie left-handers, Atlanta's Mike Minor and Florida's Brad Hand, are scheduled to pitch in Tuesday night's game. Minor gave up nine hits and six runs in four innings in his only previous start against Florida on Sept. 5, 2010. Hand is 0-2 against Atlanta this season and gave up seven runs in an 8-4 loss to the Braves at Florida on Aug. 8.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

CINCINNATI -- The Chicago Cubs' long night in New York	proved to cause no problems in Cincinnati.	Starlin Castro homered, scored four runs and drove in three	while extending his career-high hitting streak to 13 games and the	Cubs shook off their fatigue to pound out a 12-8 win over the	Cincinnati Reds in the opener of a four-game series on Monday.	The Cubs needed 11 innings to beat the Mets 10-6 on Sunday night	and didn't arrive in Cincinnati until 5:30 a.m. Monday, but they	still managed to get 16 hits, including three home runs and five	doubles.	"Coming off some rough travel and an interesting weekend in New	York, it was nice to see us come out and do that," said manager	Mike Quade, whose team participated as New York commemorated the	10th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the	World Trade Center and the Pentagon.	Aramis Ramirez also had three hits, including a double and his	25th homer of the season, and Jeff Baker added a home run as the	Cubs won a third consecutive game for the first time since Aug. 15	and matched their season high in runs. They also scored 12 in a	12-7 win over Milwaukee on June 16.	Brandon Phillips hit two of Cincinnati's four home runs and Juan	Francisco hit a tape-measure shot, but the Reds couldn't avoid	their third consecutive loss and fourth in five games.	Rodrigo Lopez lasted 5 1/3 innings to earn the win despite	allowing nine hits, including all four of Cincinnati's homers, and	five runs. Lopez (5-6) had a walk and a strikeout.	The Cubs pounced on Cincinnati starter Dontrelle Willis for	three first-inning runs and knocked him out of the game in the	fourth. Willis (0-6) gave up nine hits and eight runs, one	short of tying his career high, and walked three.	"Castro got us off to a good start," Quade said. "It was good	to give Rodrigo some run support."	Francisco got the Reds on the board with his third homer of the	season, a mammoth drive off of Lopez's 1-0 pitch in the second	inning. The 502-foot shot was second-longest at Great American Ball	Park since it opened in 2003 behind Adam Dunn's 535-foot shot to	right-center in 2004.	Somebody told him the ball hit a tree outside the stadium.	"I hit a couple out of the ballpark at (Single-A) Dayton," he	recalled. "It was just a good pitch to hit. I don't know if they	got the ball or not, but they put a branch up there."	Quade was surprised to hear the public address announcer	announce the distance before Francisco's next at bat.	"I can't remember the P.A. guy announcing how far a ball	went," Quade said. "How do they measure that?"	Willis followed one out later with a vicious line-drive single	off of Baker's glove at first base, and Phillips -- who got	his first day off on Sunday since Aug. 13 -- hit his 13th homer, a	459-foot shot into the second deck in left field.	The Cubs regained the lead in the third on Baker's third homer	of the season, a 372-foot opposite-field drive into the second row	of the right-field seats. They broke the game open with three runs	in the fourth, the first scoring on the first of Castro's two	doubles in the game. He added a two-run homer in the fifth, and	Ramirez led off the sixth with his 25th homer of the season.	"It was real tough," said Castro, who now has 190 hits and has	reached base at least once in a career-high 25 consecutive games.	"You know you're not going to sleep good. You've got to sleep	quick."	Phillips led off the Reds' fifth with his second homer of the	game, giving him two multihomer games this season and eight in his	career, and rookie catcher Devin Mesoraco hit the first pitch of	the sixth inning into the left field seats for his first career	home run.	Game notes	Reds utility INF Chris Valaika will have season-ending	surgery next week to repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament in	his right knee. He was hurt in the top of the fifth inning Sunday	at Colorado when his spikes caught in the dirt as he was swinging	at a pitch from LHP Drew Pomeranz. ... SS Zack Cozart, already	sidelined with Tommy John surgery on his left (non-throwing) elbow,	is scheduled to have minor surgery to clean out his right ankle.	... RHP Mike Leake's start Tuesday against the Cubs is expected to	be his final start of the season. Leake has logged 159 2/3 innings,	21 1/3 more than he pitched last season, and the club is trying to	limit him to an increase of about 30 innings. ... RHP Ryan	Dempster, Chicago's scheduled starter on Tuesday, is 2-0 with a	3.00 ERA in his last three starts against the Reds.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK --  Stephen Lombardozzi had never been in a situation like this before -- seventh inning, runner on second in a tie game.	He also had never gotten a major league hit -- hitless in his first 15 at-bats.	The 22-year-old with a week in the bigs came through, though, lining a tiebreaking single to left and lifting the Washington Nationals to a 3-2 victory over the New York Mets on Monday night.	"It was a big deep breath afterwards," said Lombardozzi, a 19th-round pick by the Nationals in 2008. "To drive the guy in to get the game-winning RBI is pretty awesome."	The postgame was pretty fun for him, too. First he learned that his mom and dad were at the game, then his teammates played a prank, giving him a ball with "0 for 15 now 1 for 16" written on it by Todd Coffey (5-1) before Lombardozzi was handed the real souvenir ball.	"He couldn't get too much out. He was pretty emotional," Lombardozzi said of his dad, a former big league player himself. "I think they were just as relieved as me."	Ross Detwiler and R.A. Dickey (8-12) were locked in early, each giving up one hit through four innings that took just 52 minutes. The Nationals took a 1-0 lead in the fifth with help from Mets third baseman David Wright's fourth error in three games.	Jayson Werth had three hits and Rick Ankiel and Wilson Ramos drove in runs for Washington, winners of two straight. One more win and the Nationals (68-77) will match their total from last year, when they went 69-93.	Coffey got one out in the sixth, Tyler Clippard pitched two perfect innings and Drew Storen finished after walking Wright to start the ninth for his 35th save in 40 chances.	The Mets rallied late for the third straight game only to come up short again. They have lost five of six.	Manager Terry Collins thinks his team is distracted by the controversy that has been brewing since Sunday, when players wanted to wear caps honoring emergency-service workers during the game on the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, but were denied by Major League Baseball.	"What's the attention been since we walked into the ballpark today? It's not on who we're playing, it's not on who's pitching. We all want to know which kind of hat we're going to wear tonight. And that takes away from the game," Collins said. "It all takes away from their preparation. They're all being asked questions that they're afraid to make an answer, they're afraid to say the wrong thing. We've got to start focusing on what the game is, because, when it's all said and done, that's all that matters."	In contrast to his last start -- six runs allowed against the Mets on Sept. 2, Detwiler was cruising until he lost the strike zone in the sixth and walked Justin Turner and Lucas Duda with two outs.	Wright followed with an RBI single and Angel Pagan doubled in another run with a soft liner down the right-field line to tie it 2-all and end Detwiler's night.	"Kind of lost touch of my fastball," Detwilier said. "I really wanted to finish the inning, but it was Coffey time."	Coffey couldn't sprint in from the bullpen fast enough, and he struck out Jason Bay with runners on second and third to end the inning. Bay, the NL player of the week, had another shot with one out in the ninth but struck out looking.	The Nationals regained the lead in the top of the seventh but ran themselves out of a chance to add on.	Ramos walked and advanced on Dickey's second wild pitch of the game. He moved up on a groundout, then broke for home on Brian Bixler's grounder to shortstop.	Instead of forcing a play at the plate, he froze halfway down the line and was tagged out by Wright. Lombardozzi then lined his first big league hit, coming in his sixth game. He was 0-for-15 -- including going hitless in his first three at-bats Monday -- before lining a clean single to left. Lombardozzi was called up from Triple-A Syracuse on Tuesday.	"It was fitting that it happened that way," manager Davey Johnson said. "He won't remember the 0-for-15."	While Bixler was running home, Lombardozzi took a wide turn to try and force the Mets to cut off the relay. He was caught in a rundown and tagged out by Duda.	Detwiler appeared to be on the way to his first road win in 12 career starts over four partial seasons -- the 25-year-old has received only 17 runs of support when he is in the game during that stretch. But he lasted only 5 2/3 innings, giving up three hits and three walks.	Dickey could not extend his winning streak to four straight games even though he gave up three runs -- two earned -- in seven innings. Dickey has not allowed more than three earned runs in 10 straight starts.	"I gave up a couple of two-out hits. I think one of them was with two strikes and, a lot of times in a game like that, it's going to come back to haunt you, and it did," he said.	Game notes	 The game took 2 hours, 41 minutes. ... Mets longtime public relations director Jay Horwitz had surgery on his broken right ankle. The team said he was resting comfortably. ... Nationals OF Corey Brown stayed back in Washington because the team doctors fear he has a staph infection in his knee. ...

HOUSTON --  Carlos Lee spoiled the Houston homecoming for Roy Oswalt and Hunter Pence.	He hit a two-run homer off Oswalt and the Astros beat the Philadelphia Phillies 5-1 Monday night. Oswalt tried to sneak a curveball past his former teammate.	"I was trying to throw it down and away," Oswalt said. "I had two strikes on him, and I thought I could throw it down and away for a strike, but he popped it up and it went out. Crawford seats got me here before. I knew it wasn't going very far -- front row. He hit it far enough to get out."	Despite the loss, Philadelphia's magic number for gaining at least a wild-card playoff spot dropped to one with St. Louis' 6-5 loss to Pittsburgh. The Phillies are trying to make the playoffs for the fifth straight year. They won the World Series in 2008 and lost in it in 2009.	Oswalt (7-9), who pitched 10 seasons for the Astros, faced his former teammates for the first time at Minute Maid Park since he was traded to the Phillies in July 2010.	Pence, traded by Houston to the Phillies in July, got two hits off Brett Myers (5-13).	Both Oswalt and Pence received warm ovations on their first plate appearances.	"I didn't expect it to feel as weird as it did," Pence said. "It was strange. The support they gave me was incredible. I'm not sure I was expecting that, but it was humbling. It was familiar but unfamiliar at the same time."	Myers allowed six hits in eight innings. He struck out four and walked one. Myers has allowed three earned runs in his last 22 2/3 innings.	"Sometimes you go out there and don't want to throw a pitch because they know it's coming or they have something on you," Myers said. "You just have to mix it up and keep them (as) off balance as possible."	Oswalt pitched seven innings, allowed five earned runs, struck out two and walked two.	J.D. Martinez got three hits and scored three runs for Houston. He opened the fourth inning with a double and scored on a single by Brian Bogusevic. Humberto Quintero's double scored Bogusevic for a 2-1 lead.	Martinez singled with two outs in the fourth and scored on Lee's 16th homer into the Crawford boxes in left field for a 4-1 lead.	Martinez got his third hit off Oswalt in the seventh. After Oswalt hit Lee with a pitch, he scored on a grounder by Bogusevic.	"He's a guy that throws any pitch on any count," Martinez said. "We stuck with the approach and hit off his fastball and adjusted everything else. You never know what's coming off him."	Raul Ibanez doubled to open the second inning for the Phillies and he scored on a single by Pete Orr.	Oswalt had a club-record eight opening day starts for Houston, was named to the All-Star team three times and pitched the Astros to their only World Series appearance in 2005. Oswalt ranks first in Astros winning percentage at .636.	Pence hit .290 in five seasons with the Astros. Lee said he felt comfortable facing Oswalt.	"I've had about 25 at-bats against him so I know what kind of pitcher he is," Lee said. "I got good at-bats against him. We're hitting the ball good and giving ourselves opportunities to score some runs. Today, we got some key hits."	Game notes	 The Phillies have won six of eight, outscoring opponents 36-20. ... Philadelphia is 20-7 in their last 27 road games. They have baseball's best road record at 45-28. The franchise high mark for road victories is 48 in 1976 and 2009. ... Lee has hit safely in 20 of his last 21 games, including a season-high 14-game streak. ... The Astros avoided setting a franchise record for most losses in a season. They are tied for the record with 97 losses, set in 1965, 1975 and 1991.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

CHICAGO --  Jhonny Peralta and Ryan Raburn helped the Detroit Tigers knock the White Sox further back in the AL Central race.	They ignited the Tigers offense with back-to-back homers in the second inning and Detroit routed Chicago 14-4 for its 10th straight win on Monday night.	"I don't know if there is hotter team out there right now," White Sox starter John Danks said. "It's embarrassing but at the same time you have to realize how good they're playing."	It's the Tigers' first 10-game streak since they won 11 in a row in September 1968 before going on to win the World Series that year.	Raburn finished the game with four hits and three RBIs and Peralta added two hits and three RBIs for the Tigers, who reduced their magic number to six in the AL Central.	Detroit starter Rick Porcello (14-8) coasted to an easy victory. He allowed three runs on six hits in 6 2/3 innings. He allowed one of Brent Morel's two home runs.	"We got that cushion and he got some balls on the ground and did a good job," Tigers manager Jim Leyland said. "I think that relaxed him a little bit when we got the lead and he pitched very well, but he's got to continue working to get the breaking stuff better and the changeup -- more strikes.	"He was sick, too. He had a temperature last night, he had a fever," Leyland said. "I was really worried about him going into the game, how strong he would be. I'm sure getting the lead helped relax him a little bit, he didn't have to go max effort."	The Tigers began their win streak with a sweep of the White Sox during a lopsided three-game series Sept. 3-5 in Detroit. The Tigers outscored Chicago 35-11 to sweep that series and continued to embarrass their divisional rival with a 14-run explosion on Tuesday night.	The game was eerily familiar to the 18-2 loss on Sept. 4 for the White Sox. Chicago pitching allowed 21 hits Monday night compared to the 24 in the 18-2 loss.	Danks (6-12) lasted five innings allowing eight runs, seven earned on 11 hits.	Trailing 1-0 in the second inning, Victor Martinez led off with a single against Danks. One out later, Peralta hit a two-run shot to left giving the Tigers the lead. On the next pitch, Raburn hit another ball into left-field seats to make it 3-1.	"It all started in the second inning," said Delmon Young, who was 3 for 3 before exiting the game in the sixth inning. "Victor got on base and Jhonny hit a big home run to put us on top. We had solid at-bats and good swings today."	Leading 3-2 in the third, Young led off with a single and advanced to third on Miguel Cabrera's ground-rule double to right. Young scored on Alex Avila's groundout and Cabrera scored on Peralta's single. It was Peralta's 19th of the season and Raburn's 13th.	The Tigers added to their lead in the fourth and fifth innings. Austin Jackson walked and advanced to second on a wild pitch then scored on Young's RBI single. After a leadoff double by Avila, Raburn doubled off the wall in left-center to score Avila. Raburn advanced to third after center fielder Alejandro De Aza bobbled the ball and ended up scoring on Danks' wild pitch to make it 8-2.	"I didn't have fun today at all," Danks said. "I was as frustrated as I've ever been. I want to finish strong. I want to have a good taste in my mouth going into the offseason. "	The Tigers didn't stop against reliever Josh Kinney. Kinney was tagged for five consecutive singles in the sixth, including RBI singles by Cabrera, Martinez and Avila to give the Tigers a 11-2 lead. After Peralta's double play ball, Raburn followed with an RBI single for his fourth hit of the night. With bases loaded and two outs, Ramon Santiago, who came in the game in the same inning to pinch-run for Magglio Ordonez, hit an RBI single to make it 14-2. The Tigers batted 11 in the inning and scored six runs on eight hits. Kinney somehow lasted the entire inning despite taking a liner off his back from Brandon Inge and giving up six runs on eight hits.	Juan Pierre scored on Dayan Viciedo's groundout in the first inning and De Aza scored on Gordon Beckham's groundout in the second inning.	Morel hit his seventh homer of the season off reliever David Pauley in the ninth.	Game notes	 Tigers RHP Justin Verlander, who is 20-2 since May 1, is Tuesday's scheduled starter. Verlander leads the majors in wins with 22. ... White Sox RHP Gavin Floyd is Tuesday's scheduled starter. In 17 starts against Detroit, he is 6-1 with a 3.51 ERA. ... Ordonez extended his hitting streak to 13 games. ... Jackson extended his hitting streak to 16 games against the White Sox.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- Maybe it's the sparse crowd. Maybe it's the cool Bay Area weather. Or maybe there's something about the spacious confines at the Coliseum.	Joel Pineiro's struggles in Oakland simply have him stumped.	"It's just the curse of the elephant I guess," Pineiro said, referring to Oakland's mascot, Stomper.	Josh Willingham hit his 25th homer and drove in four runs to help the Athletics chase Pineiro early again in a 6-3 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Monday night.	Willingham's three-run shot in the first inning off Pineiro (6-7) started a second straight brief outing for the Angels right-hander at the Coliseum. Los Angeles fell three games behind first-place Texas in the AL West.	Pineiro allowed four runs on five hits in three-plus innings. His short start still lasted longer than his previous performance in Oakland on July 17, when he gave up eight runs in one-third of an inning.	"It was deja vu," he said.	Gio Gonzalez (13-12) struck out six and gave up two runs in 6 2/3 innings.	Erick Aybar and Vernon Wells each hit solo home runs late for the Angels, who had won six of their last eight games to climb back into the playoff race. With only 15 games remaining, time is running out to catch the Rangers.	"All is not lost," Angels right fielder Torii Hunter said. "We can still win the series, and that's all you can ask for."	Angels manager Mike Scioscia had hoped that Pineiro's struggles were over. He had a six-start winless streak until his last outing -- allowing one run in seven innings in a 4-1 victory over Minnesota -- and seemingly fixed the mechanics in his release point that were at the root of his problems.	All that washed away quickly.	Pineiro walked two of the first three batters and pitching coach Mike Butcher visited the mound for a chat before Willingham came to the plate. Willingham sent a 1-1 pitch soaring into left-center field, skipping off the top of the wall for a home run to put the A's ahead 3-0 in the first inning.	"We signed up for 162 of them. You have to play them all," Willingham said. "In Texas, we were aware we were going to have an impact on the playoffs, whether it was good or bad. It's the same with these guys."	After Hunter singled leading off the second, Wells hit a line drive that ricocheted off the wall just below the foul pole in right. The ball skipped back over the outstretched arms of David DeJesus, giving Wells a triple and allowing Hunter to score to bring the Angels within 3-1.	Ryan Sweeney singled and Kurt Suzuki hit one his two doubles to start the bottom of the fourth. That was enough for Scioscia to pull Pineiro for Tyler Chatwood after a start that was reminiscent of Pineiro's last visit to Oakland, a 9-1 loss that was the shortest appearance by an Angels starter -- not counting an injury or ejection -- since Aug. 28, 2007.	The A's kept piling it on with a rare display of pop.	Scott Sizemore hit a run-scoring single and Cliff Pennington knocked a two-out RBI single later in the inning to put Oakland ahead 5-1. After Aybar hit his 8th home run of the season in the seventh, Willingham answered with an RBI single in the bottom of the inning to give the A's a 6-2 lead.	Wells homered for the 21st time this season in the ninth off Grant Balfour. Oakland has won 10 of the last 12 home games against the Angels.	"I don't know if it's a freak season," Scioscia said, "but we've been outplayed by that team this season."	Game notes	The A's held out closer Andrew Bailey as a precaution after he was hit just above his left ear by a foul ball from teammate Suzuki during batting practice. He passed an initial concussion test. Bailey said his vision momentarily went black but joked that his sunglasses saved him and he'll be fine. ... Scioscia said ace Jered Weaver, who is scheduled to start Wednesday in Oakland, could pitch on three days' rest Sunday at Baltimore. That would allow the right-hander to get an extra start in the season finale at Texas on normal rest. ... Oakland CF Coco Crisp was scheduled to have a precautionary MRI exam on his right foot, which he injured taking two foul balls off of it last week. Manager Bob Melvin said he was hopeful Crisp could return this season. ... The Angels will send RHP Jerome Williams (3-0, 3.51 ERA) to the mound Tuesday against A's RHP Guillermo Moscoso, who didn't allow a hit until the eighth inning in his last start against Kansas City.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SEATTLE -- For the past couple of seasons, the one pitcher who could consistently stifle the New York Yankees was Seattle ace Felix Hernandez.	That run came to an abrupt end Monday night as Robinson Cano hit a three-run double, Mark Teixeira and Chris Dickerson homered and the Yankees rolled past Hernandez and the Mariners 9-3.	"I think we've got a great team. The credit goes to us, man," said Nick Swisher, who had one of New York's 14 hits. "He's a great pitcher and we put up some good at-bats off him. You don't see that very often. You have to give credit where credit is due. Our guys did a great job tonight."	Hernandez (14-12), last year's AL Cy Young Award winner, entered with an exemplary history against the Yankees. Over his previous six starts against New York dating to Sept. 18, 2009, Hernandez was 5-0 with a 1.29 ERA, the longest winning streak by a Mariners pitcher against the Yankees.	Overall, he was 6-3 with a 2.82 ERA in 10 career starts against New York.	"They've got a pretty good lineup," Hernandez said. "You have to respect that and make good pitches. In that (fourth) inning, I just made a couple mistakes and got hit."	The Yankees roughed up Hernandez for five runs in the fourth, beginning with Teixeira's solo homer on an 0-1 pitch. It was his 37th, third-most in the league. It also was his fifth off Hernandez, more than any other batter.	Cano, who had three hits, doubled into the right-field corner and Swisher singled, with Cano stopping at third. Eric Chavez followed with a sacrifice fly.	Brett Gardner sliced a double into the left-field corner, scoring Swisher. Dickerson then hit the first pitch for his first home run as a Yankee and a 6-1 lead.	"The last live pitching I've seen was two weeks ago," said Dickerson, recalled from the minors on Sept. 1. "Especially with him on the mound, you have to jump on fastballs."	Hernandez worked six innings, giving up nine hits and six runs -- one fewer than his season high. He struck out four with no walks.	With the one-sided victory, Yankees closer Mariano Rivera didn't need to leave the bullpen for a chance at his 600th save.	Phil Hughes (5-5) pitched six strong innings to help New York increase its AL East lead to a season-high four games over idle Boston with 16 to play.	"You never expect to score a lot of runs off him. You expect a dogfight," Hughes said. "Fortunately, he wasn't on tonight and those early runs were nice to work with."	Hughes, who had not won since Aug. 19, allowed one run and five hits. He walked three and struck out three. The right-hander missed more than half the season with shoulder inflammation and is trying to re-establish himself as a reliable member of the Yankees' rotation.	"I can't change what's already happened," he said, "but from this point on I'd love to have a job here when October rolls around."	His most difficult inning was the sixth, his final one. With the Yankees leading 6-1, Kyle Seager opened with a double and Dustin Ackley reached on an infield single. Mike Carp then lined out to Derek Jeter at shortstop, but Justin Smoak walked to load the bases.	Hughes got Miguel Olivo to pop out softly to shortstop and Trayvon Robinson lined out to center.	"That was a huge situation," said catcher Austin Romine, who made his first big league start and got his first career hit, a single in the seventh. "He really dug deep right there. Larry (pitching coach Larry Rothschild) told him, 'It's your game. Let's go get 'em.' That fired him up."	Yankees manager Joe Girardi added: "That was really big. You don't want to give them any life. He (Hernandez) might go back out there if it's 6-3, 6-4."	Dan Cortes took over for Hernandez in the seventh and the Yankees worked him over. Romine got his first hit and Jeter followed with his 3,074th, a single that extended his hitting streak to 11 games. Curtis Granderson singled to load the bases, easing out from a 1-for-19 slide.	Teixeira struck out and then Cano, fouling off five fastballs after a 3-1 count, cleared the bases with a double to left. He's a .471 hitter with 27 RBIs this season with the bases loaded. Six of his eight hits have been for extra bases.	Olivo had a two-run homer, his 18th, in the eighth off Scott Proctor.	Game notes	 Yankees 3B Alex Rodriguez, who has lingering soreness in his left thumb, already has missed three straight games and might not play again until Friday. Rodriguez said his timing is fine at the plate and he was making contact during batting practice. But he said he had "no authority." Girardi said Rodriguez might return to the lineup this weekend in Toronto. "We've got to get him healthy to be productive," Girardi said. ... The Yankees lead the majors with 205 home runs. They have 48 in their last 28 games. ... Roger Hansen, 50, who has had various roles in his 18 years with the Mariners, was named special assistant to the general manager. ... The Yankees will send RHP A.J. Burnett (9-11, 5.27 ERA) to the mound Tuesday. He is one win short of his seventh straight double-digit win season and eighth overall. He is 2-2 with a 3.80 ERA in seven career starts against Seattle. ... The Mariners will counter with LHP Charlie Furbush (3-8, 4.84), acquired in a July 30 trade with Detroit. He worked a career-high 7 1/3 innings in his last start Sept. 7 against the Angels, a 3-1 loss. He has never faced the Yankees.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

LOS ANGELES -- The Arizona Diamondbacks' mantra all season has been to keep pushing, a familiar refrain used by manager Kirk Gibson. They haven't let up one bit.	Gerardo Parra tied a career high with four RBIs to back seven strong innings by Joe Saunders and the Diamondbacks rode a five-run sixth inning to a 7-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Monday night, reducing their magic number to seven for clinching the NL West title.	Arizona, vying for the fifth division crown in the franchise's 14-year history, is 17-3 following a season-worst six-game losing streak. The win put the Diamondbacks 24 games over .500, matching their season best.	"It's been a good run, but we've got to keep pushing because nothing's guaranteed," Gibson said. "You grow as a team, and certain things help you grow. K.T. (general manager Kevin Towers) has done a great job of fine-tuning what we thought some of our weaknesses were."	The Diamondbacks' fortunes have changed dramatically since July 29, when they came to Dodger Stadium for a three-game series and acquired starter Jason Marquis and reliever Brad Ziegler on consecutive days in trades with Washington and Oakland before leaving Los Angeles. Since then, they have gone 28-14 to turn a four-game deficit into an 8½-game lead over San Francisco.	"Some of the finer points in the game of baseball we're starting to utilize more than we had earlier in the year, and there's a lot more communication," Gibson said. "We had our advance meeting today and some of the veteran guys spoke up about some things that we're looking for that are going to help us in the future."	Saunders (11-12) allowed four hits, struck out four and walked one. The only runs against the left-hander came on Matt Kemp's first-inning homer and an RBI single by rookie Jerry Sands, who had three hits.	"My goal tonight was to throw strikes and try not to walk anybody," said Saunders, who retired 13 in a row at one point. "I ended up walking the leadoff guy in the seventh and he scored, so I wasn't too happy about that. But I tried to mix speeds up against a good lineup, and luckily they hit it at our guys and they were making the plays."	Saunders, coming off a 5-3 win at Colorado, has won consecutive starts for the first time since late July. But his 3.83 ERA indicates that he's been pitching better than his won-lost record would otherwise suggest.	"On a personal level, there have been a lot of peaks and valleys," Saunders said. "There was a big valley to start the year, and I've been treading pretty much uphill the whole time, just to get back to where I can be. I can't take back my 0-5 start, but you make up for lost time and do the best you can. So my goal right now is just to finish strong and keep our lead where it's at going into the postseason."	The Dodgers loaded the bases in the ninth, when Alberto Castillo hit pinch-hitter Tony Gwynn Jr. with a 2-2 pitch after Bryan Shaw gave up a pair of two-out singles. But J.J. Putz retired Dee Gordon on a grounder to get his 39th save in 43 chances.	Ted Lilly (9-14) was charged with three runs, three hits and three walks in 5 1/3 innings. He did not allow a hit until Ryan Roberts lined a 3-2 pitch over the head of third baseman Aaron Miles with one out in the fifth.	"He threw the ball well, but nothing seemed to work out tonight," Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said. "It's frustrating."	The Diamondbacks finally broke through in the sixth, grabbing a 5-1 lead and chasing Lilly. Willie Bloomquist led off with a bloop single and came all the way around on Aaron Hill's double into the left-field corner. After an intentional walk to Justin Upton, Hill got a huge jump on Lilly and stole third.	That was all for the left-hander, who departed after 101 pitches with a 1-1 count on Paul Goldschmidt. The rookie lined Matt Guerrier's first pitch to left for an RBI single, and Roberts chased Guerrier with another run-scoring single with the bases loaded after a walk to Chris Young.	Parra greeted Scott Elbert with a two-run single inside third base, capping the rally. He added a two-run double in the eighth against Mike MacDougal.	The Dodgers, beginning their final homestand of the season, took the lead with Kemp's two-out homer. It was his 33rd of the season and it increased his RBI total to 108 -- the most by a Dodger in both categories since 2004, when Adrian Beltre had 48 homers and 121 RBIs.	"He's a good hitter, so what are you going to do? I tried to make some pitches against him and they missed, so I had to come over the plate," Saunders said. "It was a good pitch, I thought, but he's a strong guy and he's got good pop the opposite way. But it only counts as one."	Game notes	 Parra also had four RBIs on July 26, 2009, against Pittsburgh. ... Saunders' most troublesome inning this season has been the first, having given up 19 runs and seven homers. The same is true over his career -- 117 runs and 25 homers. ... Miguel Montero was 0 for 3, ending his 18-game hitting streak. ... The Diamondbacks posted their major league-leading 43rd comeback victory. ... NL Cy Young Award contender Ian Kennedy will oppose Chad Billingsley on Tuesday night, attempting to join Randy Johnson, Curt Schilling and Brandon Webb as the only 20-game winners in Diamondbacks history.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Giants outfielder Cody Ross wants his teammates to openly talk about making the playoffs, even if the defending World Series champions still have a lot of ground to make up.	At least now San Francisco has an offense to back up Ross' confidence.	Ross, Carlos Beltran and Pablo Sandoval homered in a rare show of power at AT&T Park, and the Giants beat the San Diego Padres 8-3 on Monday night.	They still trail NL West-leading Arizona by 8 1/2 games but the outlook is a lot more encouraging than it was a few days ago.	That's why Ross wants San Francisco thinking big.	"Why not?" said Ross, who also singled, doubled and scored three times. "We're not going to give in. We're the defending champs and we've got something to prove. We're going to play through and see what happens."	Until recently, the Giants were only proving to be a big disappointment -- at least offensively.	But one day after scoring eight runs in a win over the Dodgers -- the most runs by San Francisco in more than a month -- the Giants matched it against the Padres.	It's the first time the Giants, the majors' lowest-scoring team since the All-Star break, have done that in back-to-back games since the first two games of the 2010 World Series.	"It's good to see the guys loosen up and swing the bats like we're capable of," manager Bruce Bochy said. "We're trying to finish up strong. We're hanging by a thread, but it's not over."	The setting was a lot different than a year ago at this time when these teams battled for the division title in a race that went down to the final day of the regular season.	The Giants still harbor slim postseason hopes this year while the Padres are just finishing out the string.	Aaron Harang (13-6), who was 4-0 in six previous starts against the Giants, took the loss after allowing all three home runs. The burly right-hander remains three wins shy of his career high.	"I felt like I couldn't get comfortable out there the first few innings," Harang said. "Sometimes when you are hitting your spots in the bullpen it's not necessarily a good thing when you get (in the game). I just couldn't get into a good rhythm and it felt like I was off mechanically."	Eric Surkamp (2-0) pitched 5 2/3 innings for his second major league victory -- both coming against San Diego. The left-hander, who beat the Padres on Sept. 6, allowed seven hits and walked one.	That might be enough to keep the 24-year-old in the Giants' rotation. Barry Zito, who has two years remaining on the $126 million deal he signed before the 2007 season, came off the disabled list Sunday but will most likely work out of the bullpen unless one of the other starters gets hurt.	Most of San Francisco's offense came from the big three of Beltran, Ross and Sandoval.	Beltran went 2 for 4 and drove in two runs, Ross added a pair of RBIs and Sandoval capped the night with a towering, three-run homer in the seventh.	It's the first time the Giants have hit three home runs in a game at their waterfront ballpark since Sept. 30, 2010.	"It's nice to get back-to-back games like this from the offense," Ross said. "It's been a lot looser in here the last five or six days. Everyone's not so uptight and tense and trying to hard. Maybe that is the key."	Beltran provided some early offense when he snapped an 0-for-15 skid with a two-run shot off Harang in the first. The ball easily cleared the wall in right field, bounced on the cement landing and fell into McCovey Cove.	It was Beltran's 18th home run of the season and third since being traded from the Mets to San Francisco on July 28.	Ross homered leading off the third, then added an RBI single in the seventh. Sandoval put the game out of reach with his three-run drive off reliever Andrew Carpenter.	Harang left after the fifth. He allowed six hits and struck out four.	San Diego, which fell to 1-4 on its seven-game road trip, scored a run in the fourth with the help of Surkamp's throwing error, then added two more in the sixth on four consecutive two-out singles to chase the San Francisco rookie.	Kyle Banks knocked in one run and Orlando Hudson singled in Chris Denorfia to cut the lead to 4-3.	San Diego put two runners on in the eighth but failed to score.	Sergio Romo, the fifth San Francisco pitcher, got Hudson to hit into an inning-ending double play, then retired the side in the ninth.	Game notes	 Giants closer Brian Wilson threw 19 pitches while facing hitters for the first time since going on the disabled list three weeks ago. Wilson will rest the next two days before the team decides what his next step will be. ... C Buster Posey (ankle) played catch before the game and will head to Arizona to start his next phase of rehab. ... OF Will Venable also played catch during batting practice to test his shoulder and could return to San Diego's lineup Tuesday. ... Padres manager Bud Black hinted that prized prospect Anthony Rizzo could get into the starting lineup in the next few days. ... Black said an ineffective slider is to blame for reliever Luke Gregerson's dip in strikeouts this year. Gregerson set a major league record for holds in 2010 and averaged 10.2 strikeouts over nine innings but that number has dipped to 5.6 this year. ... RHP Matt Cain, who lost to San Diego in his last outing despite giving up two runs in seven innings, pitches for San Francisco on Tuesday. Cain (11-10) has won only twice in his previous eight starts. ... LHP Cory Luebke (5-9), who has dropped his last three starts, goes for the Padres.

BALTIMORE --  The Tampa Bay Rays got a double dose of disappointment at Camden Yards.	Blowing a late lead in a 4-2 loss to the Baltimore Orioles on Tuesday night was tough to take. Watching the scoreboard and seeing Boston pull away from Toronto made it even worse.	Tampa Bay led 2-1 in the sixth inning, but Baltimore tied it in the seventh and took control when Matt Wieters hit a two-run homer off J.P. Howell in the eighth.	Evan Longoria homered for the Rays, whose five-game winning streak ended. The loss dropped Tampa Bay four games behind the Red Sox in the AL wild-card race.	"Not one of our better offensive nights," manager Joe Maddon said. "They just got us in the end."	During the game, Maddon and the players watched the progress of the Boston-Toronto contest on the right-field scoreboard.	"You can't help it in Baltimore because the scoreboard's right in your face," Maddon said. "Anyone that tells you they're not is not telling you the truth."	Toronto had an early lead, but Boston went ahead for good in the fourth and rolled to an 18-6 win.	"Obviously we peek at it, but our main focus is trying to win that ballgame," Tampa Bay center fielder B.J. Upton said. "What they do is out of our control."	With the score 2-all, Howell (2-3) retired the first two batters in the eighth before Vladimir Guerrero singled. Adam Jones entered as a pinch runner and Howell threw over to first base five times -- including three in a row -- before serving up a 1-1 pitch that Wieters drove into the left-field seats.	"A stupid pitch," Howell said. "You get sick. Nothing goes through your mind. You go blank. It's disgusting."	Troy Patton (1-1) retired all three batters he faced before Jim Johnson got the final out for his fifth save. It was Patton's first major league win.	Both starters pitched brilliantly but did not receive a decision.	Tampa Bay's David Price allowed two runs, one earned, and four hits in 6 2/3 innings. He is 0-2 against the Orioles, the only team to beat him twice this year.	Alfredo Simon was just as good. The right-hander gave up two runs and six hits over seven innings and had a career-high nine strikeouts, including Desmond Jennings three times.	"We like to be spoilers," Simon said. "We want to do everything we can to beat every team, so if they're in the race, so be it. We want to win every game."	So do the Rays.	"Realistically, we're not going to win the rest of our games," Maddon said. "Hopefully, we just lose a couple."	Simon retired 12 straight batters and took a 1-0 lead into the sixth. After Upton drew a one-out walk and stole second, Longoria sent a 1-1 pitch over the left-field wall.	But the Orioles bounced back in the seventh. Nolan Reimold walked and stole second before pinch-hitter Jake Fox chased Price with a run-scoring double to left-center.	Baltimore got an unearned run in the first inning when J.J. Hardy doubled, and scored when shortstop Sean Rodriguez threw wildly to first base after fielding a grounder by Nick Markakis.	Tampa Bay loaded the bases with no outs in the second before Simon struck out John Jaso and got Rodriguez to hit into a double play. The Rays didn't get another runner until Upton walked in the sixth, setting the stage for Longoria's 26th home run.	After scoring in the first, the Orioles didn't get a runner to second base until the sixth. In the fifth, Robert Andino hit a liner to left that Jennings snagged on the run at the warning track.	In the sixth, Hardy reached on an infield hit and Markakis walked before Guerrero hit into a double play. Price then retired Wieters on a grounder to third.	Game notes	 By stealing second base in the second inning, Tampa Bay's Johnny Damon became the ninth player in baseball history with 200 homers and 400 steals. ... Jones missed a fourth straight start with a sore right thumb. He was chosen as the Orioles' winner of the Roberto Clemente Award for his charitable work in the community. ... Tampa Bay RHP Kyle Farnsworth is out with a right elbow injury. Maddon said he thinks Farnsworth is improving and will return shortly. Joel Peralta served as the closer on Monday. ... Baltimore has scheduled RHP Jeremy Guthrie (7-17) for the final game of the three-game series Wednesday night. Guthrie leads the majors in losses. The Rays will start RHP Wade Davis (10-8).

PITTSBURGH -- Not even a shaky defensive performance by Albert Pujols could cool the red-hot St. Louis Cardinals.	Nick Punto hit a go-ahead double in the ninth inning and the surging Cardinals overcame three errors by their superstar first baseman to beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 6-4 Tuesday night.	Trying to stay in the wild card and NL Central races, the Cardinals won for the sixth time in seven games.	"We still got a huge hole to climb out of, but at least we're playing some meaningful baseball in September," Punto said.	The loss dropped the Pirates to 67-81. Once in the midst of a promising run, they are stuck with a non-winning season for the 19th straight year. Pittsburgh is just 16-37 since briefly moving into first place on July 19.	"We haven't done enough things in a number of these games that have put us in position to have 81 losses, that's where we are right now," manager Clint Hurdle said.	Working on the day he signed a $21 million, two-year contract, Cardinals ace Chris Carpenter hit an early two-run single. He took a 4-2 lead into the seventh, but Andrew McCutchen tied it with a two-out homer.	"I was battling all night but I made some good pitches when I had to," Carpenter said. "It was one of those nights ... but it wasn't like they were bashing it all over the place. But we did what we needed to do, and that's what's important right now."	The Pirates brought in closer Joel Hanrahan (0-4) in the ninth inning of a tie game, and he struggled with his command. Daniel Descalso collected his third single with one out and was replaced by Tyler Greene.	Punto has struggled with injuries this year but looked just fine drilling a Hanrahan fastball into the gap and Greene scored easily. Pujols provided some insurance with a sacrifice fly to take some of the sting out of his woeful night in the field. The two-time Gold Glove winner now has 14 errors this season.	"When you play this game, crazy things are going to happen," Pujols said. "At the end I just flip the page and I'm glad we got the win and those three errors didn't cause a loss."	The Pirates put runners on first and second with no outs in the ninth, but Pedro Ciriaco bunted into a forceout and Neil Walker grounded into a double play to end it.	Kyle McClellan (11-6) earned the win in relief and Jason Motte worked the ninth for his sixth save.	Carpenter, now signed to stay with St. Louis through 2013, allowed 10 hits, struck out six and walked one. The 36-year-old right-hander appeared well on his way to his 10th victory of the season until McCutchen hit his 23rd homer, snapping out of a 1-for-15 slump.	"I had good stuff tonight," Carpenter said. "I felt like I did the best I could and I got beat by one pitch late in the game."	Pittsburgh, which rallied for a dramatic 6-5 win on Monday, couldn't finish the job this time as the Cardinals kept their flickering playoff hopes alive.	"It was a good, gutty hang-in-there type of win, especially after yesterday," manager Tony La Russa said. "You get your heart broken, which means it wasn't broken, it was just bruised a little bit."	Heartbreak is an all-too familiar feeling in Pittsburgh and some baserunning gaffes helped continue the team's late-summer swoon.	The Pirates lost an apparent run in the fifth after Ciriaco tagged up on a fly by Derrek Lee. Carpenter threw the ball to third and Ciriaco was called out on appeal for leaving too early.	Hurdle came out to argue before heading back to the dugout, then took up the cause a half-inning later and was promptly ejected for the fifth time this season.	"I couldn't let Pedro wear it," Hurdle said. "Everybody in the ballpark thinks he left early and that's not normal protocol to go in there after that but I had someone I trust tell me 'No, he left right on time' and I just can't let the kid wear it. I've got to have his back."	Lee singled and scored on Pujols' error in the second, and hit a solo home run in the third. Still, it wasn't enough to prevent the Pirates from coming within one loss of yet another losing season.	"I made three mistakes, three errors, and they made some mistakes running the bases," Pujols said. "It happens. It's part of the game."	Game notes	 St. Louis OF Matt Holliday left before batting in the ninth after having trouble gripping the bat with his right hand. He'll be examined on Wednesday. ... The Cardinals activated right-handed reliever Eduardo Sanchez from the 60-day DL. He hasn't pitched since June because of a strained shoulder. ... The series concludes on Wednesday, with Edwin Jackson (4-2, 3.39 ERA) starting for the Cardinals against Charlie Morton (9-9, 3.81 ERA). Morton has struggled against the Cardinals, going just 2-4 with a 6.69 ERA against them in seven career starts. Jackson can move to .500 on his career with a victory. The 27-year-old is 59-60.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BOSTON -- Fans chanted Tim Wakefield's name. A teammate sprayed him with champagne. It was about time.	Baseball's oldest player earned his elusive 200th victory and the Boston Red Sox slugged their way to their first win in a week, 18-6 over the Toronto Blue Jays thanks to an 18-hit outburst.	The 45-year-old knuckleballer was winless in his previous seven outings. His team's playoff prospects dimmed with losses in its last five games. But on Tuesday night, Boston set a season high for runs and moved four games ahead of Tampa Bay, a 4-2 loser to Baltimore, in the AL wild-card race.	"There was some genuine happiness, probably for us, too," manager Terry Francona said. "It seemed like we'd been waiting for that win as long as Wake's been waiting for his."	The Red Sox needed the victory badly after their lead over the Rays had dropped from nine games to three over the previous nine days. And Wakefield was eager to end the long wait -- 0-3 in seven outings since his last win on July 24 -- to become the 108th pitcher with 200 wins.	"I'm kind of speechless," said Wakefield, who signed with Boston in 1995 after being released by Pittsburgh, "but I'm very grateful that I've been able to wear this uniform for as long as I have and reached a milestone that I thought I'd never reach."	Dustin Pedroia hit two homers and he and Jacoby Ellsbury had four hits each. But the Red Sox still feel pressure with a four-game home series against Tampa Bay starting Thursday night.	"Not really," Pedroia said when asked if the win took a weight off the team. "We've got 15 games left and were up, what, four now? ... We're all taking it like it's the playoffs now."	Wakefield (7-6) went six innings and overcame a shaky outing to retire his last six batters. He left with a 6-5 lead after allowing six hits and two walks. He struck out two.	The crowd clapped and chanted, "Wakefield! Wakefield!" as Junichi Tazawa pitched the ninth for Boston.	After the game, Wakefield went on the field and closer Jonathan Papelbon sprayed him with champagne. Wakefield waved and winked to the crowd and then hugged his teammates. The song "Still the One" played on the sound system.	"Two hundred wins is a long time," said Toronto manager John Farrell, Wakefield's pitching coach from 2007-10. "It's a heck of an accomplishment. We would have liked to prolong that date that he got his 200th a little bit more."	The Red Sox added to their cushion with four runs in the sixth on a double by Carl Crawford, an RBI single by Jarrod Saltalamacchia, a single by Ellsbury and a three-run homer by Pedroia, his 20th of the year. Pedroia, who tied his career high with five RBIs, also was on the tail end of consecutive homers with Ellsbury in the fourth.	Pedroia went 4 for 5 with two homers, two doubles and a sacrifice fly after going just 3 for 31 on the road trip that ended Sunday with Boston losing six of seven games. Ellsbury also had four hits and Crawford had three.	"I had a clean inning there in the sixth," Wakefield said, "then our offense exploded and made it easier to watch from inside, that's for sure."	But during his winless streak, he thought he might never reach 200 wins.	"It did cross my mind," he said, "but I kept telling myself that milestone doesn't determine me as a person. (I've) been very fortunate to live out a dream I had as a kid and I'm just thankful that it happened tonight and I'm very grateful that it happened in front of our home crowd."	Brandon Morrow (9-11) left after Crawford led off the sixth with a double and took third on Marco Scutaro's sacrifice. Luis Perez allowed hits to the only four batters he faced, starting with Saltalamacchia's single that made it 7-5.	Alfredo Aceves relieved Wakefield in the seventh and worked two scoreless innings. Tazawa, just recalled from the minors, finished up.	Boston took a 2-0 lead on unearned runs in the first when Pedroia doubled, Adrian Gonzalez walked, Kevin Youkilis was hit by a pitch and Josh Reddick was safe on a two-base throwing error by first baseman David Cooper.	Toronto went ahead 3-2 in the second on J.P. Arencibia's 23rd homer, a three-run shot. But the Red Sox made it 4-3 in the bottom of the inning on an RBI double by Ellsbury and Pedroia's sacrifice fly.	Wakefield gave the runs right back in the third when the Blue Jays took a 5-4 lead as Eric Thames led off with a single and Jose Bautista hit his major league-high 42nd homer.	Then the Red Sox went ahead to stay 6-5 on the back-to-back homers by Ellsbury, his 27th, and Pedroia.	"When you don't make pitches, we saw tonight what they're capable of," Farrell said. "Pedroia breaks out of a long slump for him with a big night. Ellsbury's been on fire all year."	Wakefield's previous start also was against the Blue Jays and he left that with an 8-5 lead last Wednesday. But the bullpen failed and Toronto came back for an 11-10 win, forcing Wakefield to keep waiting for that elusive 200th win.	But on Tuesday, the Red Sox kept adding to their lead with four runs in the sixth, one in the seventh and seven in the eighth. Saltalamacchia's three-run double highlighted Boston's final inning at the plate.	Game notes	 Boston DH David Ortiz was in the starting lineup but experienced muscle spasms in his back and Jed Lowrie pinch-hit for him in the first. ... Morrow is 0-4 in his last four starts and 1-6 in his last eight. ... Scutaro's double in the eighth was his 1,000th career hit. ... John Lackey (12-12) pitches for Boston against Ricky Romero (14-10) in Wednesday afternoon's finale of the two-game series. ... Wakefield's ERA increased from 5.03 to 5.13. ... Toronto shortstop Yunel Escobar will miss at least the two games in Boston because of a bruised left arm. ... With 20 homers and 25 stolen bases, Pedroia became the seventh Red Sox player with 20 homers and 20 steals. Ellsbury has 27 homers and 36 steals. Jackie Jensen is the only player in club history to have two 20-20 seasons.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

ATLANTA --  Brian McCann was really down on himself.	He's feeling a lot better now.	McCann came through with a three-run homer that may go down as one of Atlanta's biggest hits of the season, helping the Braves snap a four-game losing streak and move a step closer to the playoffs with a 7-1 victory over the Florida Marlins on Tuesday night.	McCann's homer came one night after he struck out with the bases loaded and one out in the ninth inning of a tie game. Florida went on to win 5-4 in the 12th, handing the Braves their longest skid of the season.	"Last night, I was the big downer," said McCann, who homered in the sixth with the Braves trailing 1-0. "It's nice to come through."	Dan Uggla added a three-run shot in the seventh -- giving him a career-best 34 homers on the year -- but he said McCann's drive was the one that really loosened the Braves up.	"That took a lot of pressure off the whole team," Uggla said. "That was not just a three-run homer. That could be one of the biggest homers this year."	The Braves, whose lead over St. Louis in the NL wild-card standings remained at 4½ games, held a private meeting before the game in hopes of shaking things up.	It worked. Uggla drew a one-out walk from Brad Hand (1-7), Matt Diaz singled to right and McCann came through with a towering shot over the center-field wall for his 24th homer.	Peter Moylan (2-1) claimed the win by getting the final out in the top half after taking over for starter Mike Minor.	The Cardinals kept pace in the playoff race, beating Pittsburgh 6-4, but Atlanta has only 13 games left.	The Braves had gone 36 innings since their last lead, struggling especially to drive home runners from third with less than two outs. McCann was one of the culprits.	"Last night was rough on me," he said. "To come back and help the team get a win is huge for me."	With his team having lost seven of nine to take away some of its comfort in the playoff race, manager Fredi Gonzalez called a private meeting before batting practice. Chipper Jones described it as "basically a circling of the wagons" designed to rouse the Braves from their worst stretch of the season.	McCann's homer was a huge relief. He came into the game mired in a 5-for-28 slump (.179) and had gone nearly two weeks since his last long ball.	"He's our rock," Uggla said. "We depend on him a lot. That's a big load on his shoulders."	Hand has walked 34 in 56 innings, and the free pass to Uggla started his trouble in the sixth.	"He pitched good for five innings. But it's a nine-inning game," manager Jack McKeon said. "Inexperience, really. You get the lead, you've got to close. You've got to shut 'em down if you want to be a winner."	Uggla's homer turned it into a laugher. Jones led off with a single to center, Freddie Freeman walked and Uggla teed off on a 1-2 pitch from Brian Sanches, driving it deep into the left-field seats to eclipse his previous career high -- 33 homers with the Marlins last season.	"Our pitchers should know Uggla," McKeon said. "But we always seem to make a mistake to him."	Considering he struggled through the first two months under .200, Uggla has produced quite a turnaround. He's homered four times off his former team.	"That's why you play the whole season," he said. "You've just got to stay positive, stay the course, keep on working and don't get down on yourself."	Michael Bourn added a sacrifice fly in the eighth.	Minor lasted 5 2/3 innings for the Braves. He allowed four hits, including Emilio Bonifacio's run-scoring single in the fifth that broke a scoreless tie.	Donnie Murphy led off with a walk -- one of four issued by Minor -- and Matt Dominguez followed with a single to center that put runners at first and third. Hand sacrificed Dominguez to second, and Bonifacio came through with a liner to right.	Dominguez had to hold at third on Bonifacio's hit and remained stranded there when Omar Infante's flyout to left wasn't deep enough for the runner to tag. Minor got out of the jam on Greg Dobbs' liner to third.	The rookie left-hander is looking as though he's ready to help in the postseason, especially if the Braves are without injured starters Jair Jurrjens and Tommy Hanson.	"I feel better and better every time I go out there," Minor said. "I feel like more a part of the team than just a fill-in. I think they kind of trust me now a little bit."	Game notes	 The Braves announced before the game that assistant general manager Bruce Manno will now oversee the player development department as well. In addition, Ronnie Richardson was promoted to director of minor league operations and John Coppolella moved up to director of professional scouting. ... Florida quietly released 38-year-old OF Mike Cameron after Monday's win over the Braves, deciding to go with younger players for the final two weeks of the season. ... Florida OF Logan Morrison had his right knee drained but an MRI showed no serious damage. He hasn't played since crashing into a wall at Pittsburgh last Friday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CINCINNATI -- Mike Leake can look forward to next year thinking about how well he ended this season.	Leake pitched eight effective innings, Brandon Phillips homered again and the Cincinnati Reds beat the Chicago Cubs 2-1 Tuesday night to end a three-game losing streak.	Leake (12-9) made the majors right out of Arizona State and this is just his second season working out of a five-man rotation. The Reds thought it best to limit his innings and do not plan to pitch him again this year.	He finished with 175 innings, with all but seven in the major leagues. He is the Reds' leader in wins and strikeouts.	"I'd like to finish the year but I understand," Leake said. "The want to protect me and protect themselves."	Leake allowed one run on six hits and two walks and struck out two.	Leake pitched a career-high nine innings in his previous start, giving up three hits against the Cubs at Wrigley Field. He took a one-hit shutout into the ninth in that game before giving up Starlin Castro's two-out infield single and pinch-hitter Bryan LaHair's tying home run.	"We wanted him to have one more start after that tough ending last time," manager Dusty Baker said. "He's matured a lot as a pitcher and a person. He reads bats well, fields his position and is an all-around player. We will limit him to pinch-running and in dire circumstances pinch-hitting."	Leake was happy with his season, even with a brief demotion to Triple-A Louisville.	"It was a good learning year. It was nice to go down for a couple weeks and prove I belong," Leake said.	Phillips homered for the third time in two games. He has 15 home runs this year.	Francisco Cordero pitched the ninth for his 33rd save.	The Cubs saw their three-game winning streak come to an end while wasting a solid pitching performance by Ryan Dempster (10-12). He allowed two runs and six hits, striking out eight in seven innings.	"That was fun," Dempster said.	After combining for 27 hits, including seven home runs, and 20 runs in Monday's 12-8 Chicago win, the Reds and Cubs produced a total of 12 hits and three runs with one homer on Tuesday.	Phillips connected in the bottom of the first for his third home run in four at-bats over the last two games.	The Reds made it 2-0 in the fifth. Devin Mesoraco drew a leadoff walk, Leake grounded into a forceout, Phillips walked and Edgar Renteria hit an RBI single. Renteria had three hits.	Carlos Pena led off the Cubs sixth with a double. He moved to third on LaHair's soft single to left-center field and scored on Alfonso Soriano's double-play grounder.	Game notes	 Castro walked to lead off the game for the second consecutive night. He has reached base at least once in 26 consecutive games. ... LaHair extended his career-opening hitting streak to eight games. ... Reds RHP Johnny Cueto, Cincinnati's scheduled starter on Wednesday, trails Los Angeles LHP Clayton Kershaw in the NL ERA race by .0044 percentage points. Cueto has gone four starts without a decision, including two blown saves. ... Chicago's scheduled starter, RHP Casey Coleman, hasn't won in nine appearances, including seven starts, since May 19 at Florida. He is 0-4 in the span.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

NEW YORK --  Craig Stammen had two feats to smile about.	Exiled to the minor leagues for most of the season, he got his first win and hit in more than a year, scoring the go-ahead run on Ryan Zimmerman's seventh-inning single Tuesday night to lead the Washington Nationals over the New York Mets 3-2.	So which accomplishment was he more proud of?	"Mmmmmm," he said, flashing a wide smile as he thought it over. "The win, even though I like hitting. That's my first win in a long time."	Stammen (1-1) entered in the sixth with two on, and got three straight outs to escape the trouble. After a leadoff walk in the seventh, he got the first out of the inning, and the Nationals held on to give him his first victory since Aug. 4 last year at Arizona.	Except for a brief callup from June 4-14, Stammen had been at Triple-A Syracuse this year until Washington brought him back Sept. 6. He was a starter for all but one game in the minors this year, going 10-7 with a 4.75 ERA in 25 appearances.	Could have been a letdown from 2010, when he was 4-4 with a 5.13 ERA for the Nationals in 19 starts and 16 relief outings.	"It's still baseball," he said. "The way I looked at it and handled it was: If you had told me five, 10 years ago when I was in high school or college, 'When you're 27, you're going to be playing Triple-A baseball and you're going to be doing it for a living,' I think I would have took it in a heartbeat and not really complained about it."	Stammen's strong sixth caused manager Davey Johnson to let him come to the plate.	"He did such a good job, I said, 'I want to see more of that," Johnson recalled. "Everybody said he could hit."	Just 15 for 69 (.217) at the plate in his big league career coming in, Stammen singled off Dale Thayer (0-2) leading off the seventh for his first hit since July 30 last year against Philadelphia's Roy Oswalt.	Ian Desmond singled him to second with one out, Rick Ankiel advanced Stammen by grounding into a forceout against Tim Byrdak, and Zimmerman lined a single to left off Bobby Parnell.	"I was more impressed with the base hit than anything," Ankiel said.	And Stammen left a positive impression on the 68-year-old Johnson, who took over as manager in June.	"I know I've got some age on me, but I've got a pretty good memory when guys do well," Johnson said.	Drew Storen, Washington's seventh pitcher, pitched the ninth for his 36th save in 41 chances. The Mets put runners at the corners on two-out singles by Jose Reyes and Ruben Tejada before Lucas Duda struck out on three pitches.	New York took a 2-0 lead in the fifth on Duda's RBI single. A second run scored when the ball skipped past Jayson Werth in right for an error. Werth started there because of a sore calf and Ankiel moved to center. Ankiel made a key play when he threw to the plate on the fly to throw out Josh Thole earlier in the inning.	Ankiel and Michael Morse tied it in the sixth with RBI doubles off Dillon Gee.	Washington's Chien-Ming Wang allowed two runs and nine hits in five innings, his first start in New York since the Yankees cut him after the 2009 season.	Washington won its third straight and, at 69-77, matched its victory total from last year (69-93). The fourth-place Nationals pulled within a game of the Mets -- Washington hasn't finished as high as third since 2002, when it was the Montreal Expos and wound up in second place.	"If you can't finish first or be the wild card, I'm not losing any sleep about trying to finish third," Johnson said. "There's a lot more that has to go on here."	Game notes	 New York (71-77) has lost four in a row and six of seven since pulling within a game of .500 and is closing in on a third straight losing season. The Mets were hurt when pitcher Gee, Nick Evans and Tejada all failed to get down bunts. ... Ramos went 0 for 4. He entered 18 for 32 (.563) against the Mets this year. ... Washington assigned RHP Garrett Mock outright to Syracuse of the International League. ... Nationals OFs Roger Bernadina (cut on left hand) and Laynce Nix (strained right groin) could be back within a few days, according to manager Davey Johnson. OF Corey Brown may not return this season following surgery to remove an infection in a knee.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- David Murphy is finding his September swing for the AL West-leading Texas Rangers. And it could keep him in the lineup even with slugger Nelson Cruz coming off the disabled list.	Murphy had a pair of solo home runs among his four hits before Josh Hamilton and Adrian Beltre went deep to power the Rangers to a 10-4 victory over the Cleveland Indians on Tuesday night.	"Early in the season, I try so hard and want to play so well so badly I just get outside myself as a player," Murphy said. "Right now my approach is solid because I'm not trying to do too much. I'm trying to hit line drives up the middle and if they make a mistake and leave a ball up, it might go in the gap or occasionally hit a home run. ... Bottom line, I didn't feel like it was going to happen this year. Things always work themselves out."	Back in the lineup on a regular basis after Cruz got hurt, Murphy has hit .424 with six homers and 20 RBIs over his last 16 games going back into the last week of August -- after only three RBIs his previous 22 games. Murphy scored four times against the Indians and has raised his overall average to .274, his highest since May 2.	With two weeks left in the regular season, the Rangers activated Cruz from the disabled list earlier Tuesday, but want to ease him back on the field after his second DL stint because of leg problems. He had been out since Aug. 29 with a left hamstring strain.	Murphy's play will certainly help manager Ron Washington stick to that plan.	Then when Cruz is back, the manager plans to keep a spot in the lineup for Murphy, who last September hit .355 when the Rangers clinched the AL West title on the way to their first World Series.	"When Nelson comes back, it's not going to affect the way David is playing. ... He's going to continue to play if he continues to swing the bat the way he's swinging. How am I going to pull him out of the lineup," Washington said. "It's aggressive, he continued to work, didn't drop his head because things weren't going well."	Switch-hitting catcher Carlos Santana homered twice for Cleveland, becoming the first Indians batter since Victor Martinez on June 1, 2007, to go deep from both sides of the plate. He added a double between his homers, completing that at-bat after fouling a pitch hard off his left shin and needing a couple of minutes to gather himself.	Murphy already had both of his homers, his 10th and 11th of the season, before Elvis Andrus drew a one-out walk in the fifth off Justin Masterson (11-10) and Hamilton followed with his 20th homer, a scorching liner into the right-center field seats by the Texas bullpen for a 4-2 lead.	"He gave the rest of his teammates a chance to get in the flow," Washington said of Murphy. "And when they got in the flow, we pulled away."	The Rangers got four runs in the sixth off Masterson and two relievers. Craig Gentry had a pinch-hit, two-run single and Andrus a two-run double.	Beltre extended his hitting streak to 17 games, matching a career high, when he led off the seventh with a 411-foot blast.	Beltre's 24th homer of the season came as the first major league batter faced by right-hander Zach Putnam, who then gave up a double to Murphy and a run-scoring single to Mike Napoli before finally recording an out.	"This is one of the best lineups in the league, right up there with the one in New York and the one in Boston. Nellie Cruz wasn't even in the lineup," Indians manager Manny Acta said. "They're so deep one through nine. Some other lineups, four guys in the middle are good. With these guys, one through nine, and they have a couple guys they can platoon."	Matt Harrison (12-9) gave up three runs on seven hits while pitching into the sixth inning in his first start for Texas in nine days. The left-hander struck out four and walked one.	Murphy pulled homers to right field in each of his first two at-bats. He led off the second, then two innings later hit a ball that ricocheted off the first row in the second deck of seats. It was his third career multihomer game, his first at Rangers Ballpark.	The last batter Masterson faced was Murphy, who led off the sixth with a slow roller up the first-base line. Masterson fielded the ball and weakly flipped it toward the bag as Murphy reached on an infield single to start the sixth-inning outburst.	Masterson gave up six runs and eight hits with two strikeouts and three walks.	Game notes	 Texas is 7-1 against Cleveland this season. ... Ian Kinsler extended his Rangers record with his 24th consecutive stolen base without getting caught. He was promptly picked off at second base, though that doesn't affect his still-active streak. ... Rangers DH Michael Young had an extra hit even before the game began. The Rangers said an MLB committee overturned an error by Oakland pitcher Brandon McCarthy in the first inning Friday night. The scoring change gave Young three hits for that game matching Hamilton's team record of 24 three-hit games in a season. ... Rangers LHP Derek Holland, 7-1 over his last 12 starts since July 7, is scheduled to make his 30th start Wednesday for Texas. Indians rookie LHP David Huff (2-4) makes his ninth start since July 18.

HOUSTON -- This is the time of year when manager Charlie Manuel would like to see his Philadelphia Phillies playing their best baseball.	Instead, they dropped their second straight game against the worst team in baseball on Tuesday night to keep them from wrapping up a playoff spot.	Clint Barmes hit a three-run homer and J.A. Happ pitched six solid innings against his former team as the Houston Astros beat Philadelphia 5-2.	The Phillies needed a win over Houston or a loss by St. Louis to clinch at least a wild-card berth. But the NL East leaders will have to wait to secure their place in the postseason after the Cardinals beat the Pirates 6-4 on Tuesday night.	"We talk all year long about where we want to go, and that's to the World Series and win it," Manuel said. "We're sitting in a (heck) of a position, and when we come out and play kind of sloppy and we don't have a lot of life and stuff like that, we have to play better than that."	It's the first time the Phillies have dropped three in a row since losing four straight from May 31 to June 4. They get their next chance to clinch Wednesday afternoon with Roy Halladay on the mound in the series finale.	Manuel was unhappy with the two errors his team committed Tuesday.	"If we come out and play right, we hustle and we make physical mistakes by hustling, you can buy into that," he said. "But when we start making mental mistakes and getting sloppy and things like that, and taking things for granted, we don't want to play that way. I feel we're much better than that."	Philadelphia starter Cole Hamels (14-8) fell to 0-3 in his last five starts against the Astros after going 3-0 in his first four career starts against them.	The Phillies were swept by the Astros in a four-game series late last season in Philadelphia.	Hamels suggested his team might not have the right mindset playing against Houston.	"Their motivation was a little bit more than I guess what we had," he said. "I guess that's where they are beating us. They are motivated and we are not taking it as serious."	The Astros won their second straight game to avoid setting a franchise record for losses. Their 97 defeats are tied for the club mark, which has been reached three other times, most recently in 1991.	J.B. Shuck singled in the fourth inning and stole second base before Happ reached on an error by first baseman Ryan Howard with one out. Jason Bourgeois drove in Shuck with a single to put Houston up 2-1 before Barmes' first-pitch homer.	Hunter Pence hit his 20th home run on a ball that bounced high on the wall in left-center to tie it at 1 in the fourth. The former Astro, traded to Philadelphia in July, received a standing ovation from a group of fans sitting near the Phillies dugout.	Happ (6-15), acquired from the Phillies last year as part of the Roy Oswalt trade, allowed four hits and one run with four strikeouts. Fernando Rodriguez threw two scoreless innings before David Carpenter took over for the ninth.	Carlos Ruiz hit a one-out solo homer off Carpenter to make it 5-2.	The Phillies had a shot to cut into the lead in the fifth inning when Jimmy Rollins singled with two outs before Happ walked Placido Polanco and Pence to load the bases. Howard took Happ to a full count on an eight-pitch at-bat before J.D. Martinez made a leaping catch at the left-field wall to end the inning.	"Obviously relieved to get out of that situation and keep the lead where it was," Happ said. "I was a little frustrated I got myself into it, but to get out of it was huge."	Houston manager Brad Mills was impressed with Happ's composure.	"J.A. did a real good job of keeping his emotions under control," Mills said. "Sometimes he put everything right on the edge, but stayed down in the zone which I thought was absolutely outstanding. He kept getting behind in the count but getting himself back in the count, which was big."	Martinez had an RBI double to give Houston a 1-0 lead in the first inning. Barmes doubled to set up the score. Carlos Lee singled after the double by Martinez, before Matt Downs was hit by a pitch to load the bases with one out.	Hamels escaped the jam by retiring the next two Astros.	Downs looked to have been spiked in the finger when John Mayberry Jr. slid into second base on a double in the second inning. Downs was checked by trainers, but remained in the game.	Downs singled with two outs in the third and reached third on the play on an error by Mayberry when the grounder rolled between his legs in center field. Downs was left stranded when Chris Johnson grounded out to end the inning.	Right fielder Jason Michaels robbed Howard of a hit with a diving catch, which injured his left hand in the second inning. Michaels finished the inning, but was replaced by Shuck in the third. The team said Michaels broke a bone in his left hand and would have season-ending surgery Wednesday.	Game notes	 Despite the loss, Philadelphia is 30-10 against lefties this season. ... The teams wrap up the three-game series Wednesday when Houston's Bud Norris faces Halladay, who allowed four hits and one run while striking out nine over eight innings in his last start, a 5-3 win over Milwaukee. Norris has won just once in his last 11 starts. ... Lee has hit safely in 21 of his last 22 games.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CHICAGO --  Get this, Justin Verlander said he felt better Tuesday night than he had in a while.	It sure is a great time to play for the Detroit Tigers.	Verlander pitched seven strong innings to earn his major league-best 23rd win and the Tigers blanked the Chicago White Sox 5-0 for their 11th consecutive victory.	Verlander (23-5) allowed six hits, struck out six and walked two while becoming the first Tiger since Hal Newhouser in 1946 to win 11 consecutive starts and the AL's first 23-game winner since Barry Zito in 2002.	"It's probably best I've felt in the last few starts, the last five or six," Verlander said. "I really felt like I was getting back that rhythm I've been trying to find for a while."	That's a scary statement for the rest of the American League.	Verlander improved to 11-0 with a 2.51 ERA since his last loss on July 15 in Chicago, his only defeat in 15 decisions against AL Central opponents this season.	"He's the best pitcher I've ever had," manager Jim Leyland said. "I'll leave it at that."	Victor Martinez hit a three-run homer for AL Central-leading Detroit, buoyed by its longest winning streak since September 1968. Miguel Cabrera had two doubles, walked twice and scored two runs.	"(Martinez's homer) allowed me to go out there and be aggressive," Verlander said. "That's probably the reason I was able to go seven innings."	Gavin Floyd (12-11) gave up four runs and four hits in 5 1/3 innings, falling to 6-2 with a 3.68 ERA in 17 career starts against Detroit.	Brent Morel doubled and walked twice for Chicago. Alex Rios had three singles.	"When you face a pitcher of that caliber you've got to get it done before he starts to make his pitch," White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen said. "He throws every pitch in any count. The guy throws 98 and he'll throw you a 3-2 breaking ball. I don't think you can do much about that."	Detroit has won five straight against the White Sox and reduced its magic number to win the Central to four over Cleveland. The Tigers have outscored Chicago 54-15 during the streak.	"I've said all year that we weren't playing our best baseball," Verlander said. "You look at the talent around this room, if everybody gets rolling it's going to be tough to beat us. This last couple of weeks, it's been an example of that."	Cabrera doubled and scored in the second, and the Tigers added three more in the sixth. With one out and a runner on third, Cabrera was intentionally walked before Martinez sent a 3-2 pitch over the Detroit bullpen in right.	Martinez battled Floyd for nine pitches, fouling off five, before going deep in the game's most important at-bat.	"Terrific at-bat, it really was," Leyland said. "It was a terrific at-bat and he got one and didn't miss it."	Floyd walked the next two batters and threw a wild pitch before being pulled after 98 pitches.	For the second straight start, Verlander allowed a number of baserunners and foul balls early in the game to drive up his pitch count, but settled down to pitch through the seventh. He has gone at least six innings and thrown at least 104 pitches in each of his 32 starts this season.	"Being a power pitcher, foul balls come with the territory," Verlander said. "It's going to happen. Sometimes, your pitch count is going to creep up a little bit. Once we got a little bit more of a lead, I was able to calm back down and go seven innings."	The 6-foot-5 right-hander, a front-runner for the AL Cy Young Award, worked out of jams in three of the first four innings. He got Dayan Viciedo on an around-the-horn double play with runners on the corners and one out in the first, then got Gordon Beckham to fly out with two on to end the second.	Verlander also struck out Beckham looking with a curveball with two outs and the bases loaded in the fourth.	"He threw a couple of unhittable pitches," Leyland said.	The White Sox were 0 for 6 with runners in scoring position in the game, dropping to 5 for 45 in those situations over their last five games.	The Tigers have won 21 of their last 25 games.	"It's not easy," Leyland said. "It never gets easy. It's hard to do. We've been on a nice run and hopefully we can keep it going."	Game notes	 The annual Roberto Clemente Award nominees were announced on Tuesday. Verlander and Chicago's Juan Pierre were among the entrants for the award, which recognizes players for positive contributions both on and off the field. ... The Tigers and White Sox wrap up their series on Wednesday afternoon, with Detroit's Brad Penny facing Dylan Axelrod. The 25-year-old Axelrod will be making his second big league appearance and first start.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Bruce Chen kept pumping in strikes Tuesday night, and his defense loved it.	Chen pitched eight crisp innings and Alex Gordon homered, leading the Kansas City Royals to a 4-0 victory over the Minnesota Twins.	Chen (11-7) allowed two singles, struck out eight and walked one. He was 0-2 with a 7.94 ERA in his previous two starts.	"It's tough to put balls in play solidly against him when he's on and he was on tonight," said third baseman Mike Moustakas, who homered in the second. "It's fun to watch a guy like that and play defense when he's in a zone the way he was tonight.	"He goes out and dominates. He does what he does. Each pitch was exactly where he wanted."	Ben Revere and Danny Valencia had Minnesota's only hits off Chen, who improved to 2-4 with a 5.54 ERA in 16 career games against the Twins. Revere, who stole second after his leadoff single in the first, was the only Twins runner to reach second.	Chen, who threw 82 of his season-high 119 pitches for strikes, also got some help from his defense. Johnny Giavotella made an over-the-shoulder grab of Jason Kubel's fly to shallow right in the second and Melky Cabrera robbed Valencia of extra bases with a diving catch to end the eighth.	"My teammates played real good defense behind me and Salvador called a real good game," Chen said, praising rookie catcher Salvador Perez. "I threw all my pitches and I was commanding the baseball. I throw a lot of (different) pitches. I have to, to make my fastball look like it's 90-91. I have to make sure I have a lot of deception and use a lot of pitches. I just want to pound the strike zone."	Louis Coleman yielded a single to Joe Mauer while finishing the Royals' sixth shutout of the season.	Kansas City finished with 12 hits. Gordon went 3 for 5 and drove in two runs, including a leadoff drive off Carl Pavano in the third for his 22nd homer.	Moustakas, who led the minors last year with 36 home runs, connected for his second big league home run and first at Kauffman Stadium. Moustakas went 281 at-bats since his June 11 home run at Los Angeles.	"The homer-less drought was not the first time and it's definitely not going to be the last," Moustakas said.	Eric Hosmer, another one of Kansas City's prized prospects, drove in Cabrera with a grounder in the third. Cabrera doubled and advanced to third on left fielder Joe Benson's throwing error to set up the run.	Pavano (8-12), who won his first two September starts, allowed four runs, three earned, and 11 hits in seven innings. That pushed his innings total to 200, the second straight year he has reached that mark.	"I don't think we hit a ball hard all night," Pavano said. "Bruce kept our guys off the bases and I couldn't keep them off the bases."	The Twins, who have lost 18 of 22, dropped three games behind the Royals in the battle for last in the AL Central. The Twins have won the past two division titles, while the Royals have finished last the past two seasons.	The Twins have hit .149 and scored seven runs while losing the first four games on their road trip.	"He was mixing it up, showing a lot of different angles, throwing a lot of breaking balls and changeups." Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said of Chen. "I think our guys were saying it best -- not one of his pitches goes straight."	Game notes	 RF Michael Cuddyer and designated hitter Kubel returned to the Twins lineup. Cuddyer missed five games with a sore left wrist, while Kubel, who had a sore foot, made his first start since Friday. Cuddyer went 0 for 3 and is hitless in his past 18 at-bats. ... 1B Justin Morneau returned to Minneapolis to attend to family matters, but he has not played since Aug. 28 because of mild concussion-like symptoms. ... Giavotella, who was held out of the Royals lineup the previous two games, snapped an 0-for-16 slide with a second-inning double. He also singled in the fifth. ... RHP Liam Hendriks, who is from Australia, will make his second big league start Wednesday for the Twins. He gave up three runs and four hits in seven innings in a 3-0 loss to the Chicago White Sox in his Sept. 6 debut. RHP Luke Hochevar, who is 5-3 with a 3.56 ERA since the All-Star break, will start for the Royals.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MILWAUKEE --  Ryan Braun said he played the worst 10 innings of the season. Good thing it went 11.	Braun homered leading off the 11th and the Milwaukee Brewers beat the Rockies 2-1 on Tuesday night to win their sixth straight at home over Colorado.	"Tonight was not a pretty game, we didn't play well," Braun said. "It was nice to find a way to win. I don't think we really deserved that game. But good teams find a way to win games they shouldn't sometimes."	Prince Fielder also went deep for Milwaukee, which remained 6½ games ahead of second-place St. Louis in the NL Central with 13 to play.	"It's close to the end, we want to hurry up and get it done if we can," Fielder said. "You can't control what the Cardinals do. We can only control what we can do."	Zack Greinke labored through five innings before the Brewers' bullpen picked him up. LaTroy Hawkins, Takashi Saito, Francisco Rodriguez, John Axford and Kameron Loe (4-7) combined for six scoreless innings.	"All the credit for tonight's win goes to our bullpen (and) for Greinke battling through our horrendous defensive performance," Braun said. "It's just nice to find a way to win."	Fielder homered in the sixth to tie it and it stayed that way until the 11th, when Braun homered off Matt Lindstrom (2-2) and pumped his right fist in excitement before joining the scrum at home plate.	Braun had been 0 for 4 leading up to that point, misplayed a ball that led to the Rockies' only run and needed a 10-pitch at-bat to connect off Lindstrom.	"It's fun to play meaningful games this time of year. Obviously, we understand what's at stake," Braun said. "I had plenty of pent-up aggression before I hit that ball."	After the Rockies scored early, Fielder hit his 32nd homer after coming in with just two extra-base hits over his previous 35 at-bats. It was his first homer since Sept. 2 in Houston.	In the eighth, Mark Ellis led off with a single and reached second, but Milwaukee shortstop Yuniesky Betancourt grabbed Todd Helton's liner to end the inning. Axford didn't allow a baserunner in the ninth and worked around Dexter Fowler's one-out single in the 10th.	The Rockies put runners in scoring position with two outs against Loe in the 11th, but Wilin Rosario grounded out to end the inning.	"We gave a hell of an effort against a very, very good baseball team with a lot at stake," Rockies manager Jim Tracy said. "What it simply boils down to is just a timely hit somewhere as that game was unfolding. "	Milwaukee started with a victory in its final stretch of 14 games against teams with losing records in the quest to wrap up its first division title since winning the AL East in 1982. The Cardinals beat the Pirates 6-4 earlier Tuesday.	Helton, Ellis, shortstop Troy Tulowitzki and right fielder Carlos Gonzalez all returned to the Rockies' lineup after missing at least one game because of injuries, but Tulowitzki (hip) and Helton (back) left before the game ended.	Tulowitzki started a double play off his back foot in the fourth inning that got starter Esmil Rogers out of a jam. Rogers worked six innings, his only costly mistake coming to Fielder.	In the third, Greinke saved a run with a spectacular play. With the bases loaded and two outs, he spiked a breaking ball that got away from catcher Jonathan Lucroy.	Greinke quickly sprinted toward the loose ball, grabbed it with his glove and flipped it out to Lucroy, who blocked the plate and was able to tag out Ellis to end the inning.	Both teams cut down a run at the plate early.	Brewers third baseman Casey McGehee threw out Ellis on a fielder's choice in the first, and Rickie Weeks was tagged out at home by Rosario trying to score from first on McGehee's double in the second.	Colorado scored in the fourth on Rosario's single to take a 1-0 lead. Greinke struck out nine, but only made it through five innings because he threw 116 pitches after the Brewers committed two errors that he worked around.	"It was a fun game -- in the end," Greinke said. "It was stressful at the time."	Game notes	 Officials decided to close the roof at Miller Park early Tuesday because of smoke drifting about 400 miles southeast from a large wildfire in Minnesota. ... Weeks left before the start of the seventh as the Brewers continue to limit his innings in his return from a severely sprained left ankle. ... Tulowitzki hit a ball that bounced off the roof's support cables in left field during the third inning. The ball was ruled foul, though it landed in the field of play. ... Brewers RHP Shaun Marcum (12-6, 3.25 ERA) faces Rockies RHP Kevin Millwood (2-2, 3.79) in the finale of this two-game set Wednesday night.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  Erick Aybar's defense, speed and quick decision-making gave the Angels a rare late lead at the Oakland Coliseum. Howie Kendrick's power made it stand up.	Aybar scored the go-ahead run on a wild throw home in the seventh inning and Kendrick homered twice, including a two-run insurance blast in the ninth, to lift Los Angeles to a 6-3 win over the Athletics on Tuesday night.	"We need contributions from a lot of guys and we need guys to start producing the way they can," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "Howie gave us a big boost with both his home runs. We need some other guys to start following suit and we can get a little more momentum going."	The Angels can't afford many hiccups down the stretch.	Los Angeles remains three games behind division-leading Texas, which beat Cleveland earlier in the day. The Angels and Rangers finish the regular season with a three-game series in Anaheim.	Maicer Izturis added two hits and an RBI and Aybar also had two hits for the Angels, who snapped a two-game losing streak.	Aybar, batting .476 over his last six games, singled leading off the seventh and was sacrificed to second. Hank Conger's hit moved Aybar to third before Izturis hit a grounder off Fautino De Los Santos (2-2) to shortstop Cliff Pennington. Aybar broke for home on the play and made it safely when Pennington's throw was wide of the plate.	"We definitely need some guys to start moving forward and carrying some momentum for us in these last couple weeks," Scioscia said. "We've seen glimpses of it ... but right now there's a finite amount of games (left) and there's a premium on us scoring the runs that are going to let us get games under our control."	Hisanori Takahashi (4-3), the first of four Los Angeles relievers used in the game, pitched 1 2/3 innings for the win while rookie Jordan Walden worked the ninth for his 30th save.	The Angels combined for seven walks but matched their season high of four double plays to limit the damage and win for only the third time in their last 13 games at the Coliseum.	It was also Los Angeles' sixth victory on the road since Aug. 1.	Kendrick hit a two-run home run in the third off starter Guillermo Moscoso, then added another two-run blast in the ninth.	"Accidents," Kendrick said. "A couple mistakes out over the plate. All I was trying to do was put a good swing on it."	Josh Willingham doubled and drove in two runs for the A's, who had won five of six against their AL West rivals before Tuesday's loss.	The A's left the bases loaded in the fifth and stranded eight runners overall.	"We had way too many opportunities to blow that game open and we didn't come through with runners in scoring position," Oakland manager Bob Melvin said. "Guys that normally come through for us didn't, and on top of that we hit into double plays. It was a rough night for us offensively."	Neither starter was around for the decision.	Moscoso carried a no-hitter into the eighth inning of his previous start against Kansas City on Sept. 7 and retired the first six Angels before Aybar's double in the third.	Peter Bourjos followed with a foul pop-up near the Angels bullpen that first baseman Brandon Allen chased down. Aybar wisely tagged up at second and beat Allen's throw to third, then scored when the ball skipped past Oakland third baseman Scott Sizemore and Moscoso backing up on the play.	Izturis singled to keep the inning going, and Kendrick capped it with his 17th home run of the season to give the Angels a 3-0 lead.	Angels' right-hander Jerome Williams had control problems in the bottom of the frame and nearly gave it all back.	A former first-round pick of the San Francisco Giants, Williams gave up an RBI double to Jemile Weeks and a bases-loaded walk to Willingham -- one of three free passes he issued in the inning.	Williams continued to struggle, giving up back-to-back walks in the fifth. Willingham then doubled in front of diving right fielder Torii Hunter, scoring Pennington with the tying run.	Kendrick's second home run came off reliever Michael Wuertz. The Angels slugger, who has four multi-home run games in his career, has 18 homers this season.	Game notes	 Oakland CF Coco Crisp had an MRI on his sore right foot and Melvin said he expects Crisp to play again this season. ... Scioscia kept rookie 1B Mark Trumbo out of the lineup because he felt the rookie might be pressing a little. "This is a good time for him to catch his breath and hopefully finish strong," Scioscia said. "The last 10 at-bats you're seeing a little tighter grip on the bat. To reach our goal we need him to get back to where he could be. ... RHP Jered Weaver, second to Detroit's Justin Verlander for lowest ERA in the AL, pitches for the Angels on Wednesday. Weaver (16-7) has a three-game losing streak on the road. ... RHP Rich Harden (4-2), who last beat Los Angeles more than a year ago, goes for Oakland. ... Oakland Raiders defensive lineman Richard Seymour threw out the first pitch.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

SEATTLE -- The celebration was pure Mariano Rivera.	No big screams or wild gestures. Certainly no spectacle, even if Rivera is widely regarded as the best ever at what he does.	Just warm hugs and appreciative handshakes from Yankees teammates. And even that might have been more than what Rivera wanted following the 600th save of his remarkable career.	"Maybe later on after I retire, but right now I'm not focused on that. I'm not that type of guy. I'm a team player," Rivera said. "I tell you guys many times and I'll continue to tell you, it doesn't depend on myself. It depends on my teammates giving me the opportunity to be able to pitch."	Rivera moved within one save of Trevor Hoffman's major league record by closing out New York's 3-2 win over the Seattle Mariners on Tuesday night.	In a season in which teammate Derek Jeter already reached one of baseball's grandest milestones with his 3,000th hit, Rivera also has added to his Yankees legacy. Next up is No. 601, which could come Wednesday night in the series finale at Seattle.	But even Rivera acknowledged the big one will be No. 602, when he passes Hoffman to become the most prolific closer in major league history. That leaves little time to savor No. 600, or 601. The quick turnaround is just part of the job.	Rivera entered with a one-run lead in the ninth inning and allowed just a one-out single to Ichiro Suzuki. He was retired when catcher Russell Martin caught Suzuki trying to steal second for the final out.	That biting cutter was there again on Tuesday night as Rivera notched his 41st save of the season in his 46th opportunity.	It was the 1,037th appearance of his career, but it almost didn't happen. Setup man David Robertson labored through the eighth as Rivera started stretching out, giving up a leadoff single to Dustin Ackley and walking Justin Smoak with one out. Robertson got Miguel Olivo swinging at a 3-2 pitch while the runners advanced. Robertson then fell behind Adam Kennedy 2-0 and issued an intentional walk to load the bases.	Trayvon Robinson came on to pinch-hit for Casper Wells, who had struck out three times already, but couldn't do any better, striking out on a fastball and leaving the bases loaded.	Rivera then took off his jacket and started throwing moments later. He didn't have much time to get ready as New York went down quickly in the top of the ninth, but jogged in with most of the Yankees fans in attendance standing and many snapping pictures.	Nearly the entire Yankees dugout stood on the top-step railing.	Pinch-hitter Wily Mo Pena was gone on a foul-tip strike three into Martin's glove. Suzuki then served a soft single into left field, but Rivera struck out rookie Kyle Seager.	He didn't even need to finish pitching to Ackley as Suzuki was thrown out by Martin trying to steal. Rivera savored the chance to share the moment with Jeter and another longtime teammate, Jorge Posada.	"They are family away from your family. It was great seeing them all come to the mound," Rivera said. "Again, I've been blessed to have a great bunch of guys who have supported me and given me all the opportunities."	Robinson Cano provided the Yankees offense with a homer and two RBIs, while A.J. Burnett (10-11) won for the first time since Aug. 15 thanks to a season-high 11 strikeouts. New York stayed four games in front of second-place Boston in the AL East after the Red Sox thumped Toronto 18-6.	Rivera missed out on a save chance in the series opener when the Yankees battered nemesis Felix Hernandez in a 9-3 victory. But the New York offense was kept in check Tuesday night by Charlie Furbush (3-9), who allowed just three runs and struck out six in 5 1/3 innings.	Nick Swisher's leadoff double in the sixth eventually led to Cano's fielder's choice that scored Swisher with the go-ahead run. Rafael Soriano and Robertson worked the seventh and eighth innings to set the stage for Rivera.	And perhaps to Rivera's liking, he wasn't the one recording the final out. It was Martin coming through with a perfect throw to get Suzuki.	"I don't know if we'll ever see it again. That's how much of an accomplishment this is that he and Trevor Hoffman have done. Simply remarkable," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "This is a guy who I believe is the best closer that's ever been in the game and I've had the fortune of catching him, coaching him and managing him and it's a treat."	Game notes	 Burnett's two wild pitches gave him 25 for the season. That's the most for any pitcher since San Diego's Matt Clement had 23 in 2000. ... Seattle SS Brendan Ryan left the game before the start of the sixth with a sore back and was replaced by Luis Rodriguez. ... Girardi said the team expects Rodriguez to be ready to play on Friday when the Yankees open a three-game series in Toronto. ... Yankees RHP Ivan Nova starts in the series finale on Wednesday, looking to start a new streak. He had an eight-start consecutive win streak snapped with a no-decision last Thursday in Baltimore. ... LHP Jason Vargas makes his 30th start of the season on Wednesday for Seattle. He is 2-7 with a 6.56 ERA over his last 11 starts.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

LOS ANGELES -- Late-inning deficits are no problem for the Arizona Diamondbacks.	Chris Young scored the go-ahead run on a bases-loaded walk in the 10th inning, lifting NL West-leading Arizona to a 5-4 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Tuesday night. It was the Diamondbacks' 44th comeback victory, tops in the majors.	"We get frustrated sometimes, but overall just a good game," said manager Kirk Gibson, a former Dodgers star. "We felt the pressure, but we performed well. We didn't make any big mistakes and finally got a run across."	Gerardo Parra sparked the Diamondbacks with a tying homer off Hong-Chih Kuo with two out in the seventh, then a leadoff single in the 10th.	After Aaron Hill sacrificed and Justin Upton struck out, Javy Guerra (2-1) issued consecutive walks to Miguel Montero, Paul Goldschmidt and Young, helping Arizona win its second in a row and sixth in seven games. The D-backs are 8-4 in extra-inning games.	"It's a pressure situation," Young said of Guerra's jam. "He had been so successful at home and he has great stuff. He lost control. It happens every now and then."	Micah Owings (7-0) pitched a scoreless ninth for the win and J.J. Putz finished for his 40th save in 44 chances.	Arizona starter Ian Kennedy was denied his 20th victory. The right-hander gave up four runs and seven hits, struck out four and walked one in six innings. It was his most runs since July 3, when he allowed seven in a 7-2 loss at Oakland.	"I wasn't commanding it as well. It wasn't as sharp as it had been, especially with two strikes," said Kennedy, who was getting over a cold bug that has hit the team. "I kind of let the team down. It was tough."	Dodgers starter Chad Billingsley allowed three runs and four hits in 6 1/3 innings, struck out two and walked three in his fourth straight no-decision.	"The past few starts have been a rough stretch," he said. "I'm trying to find my delivery again and trying to figure it out, I guess. I'm just going to keep working."	Matt Kemp was hitless in five at-bats, including three strikeouts, for the Dodgers a day after going 2 for 4 with a homer in the series opener. Los Angeles has dropped three in a row.	Montero drove in three runs, including a two-run homer -- his career-best 16th -- in the first that gave Arizona the lead. His sacrifice fly in the third trimmed Los Angeles' advantage to 4-3.	The Dodgers scored four runs on five hits off Kennedy in the bottom of the first.	Kemp hit a sacrifice fly, then James Loney, Aaron Miles and Jerry Sands had two-out hits. Loney doubled into the right-field corner, Miles singled to center and Sands doubled into the left-field corner to complete the scoring in the 34-minute inning.	Game notes	 The Dodgers lost their first extra-inning home game of the season and fell to 8-2 in extra-inning games. ... Kennedy has allowed one run or less 15 times this season. ... The Diamondbacks are 7-2 at Dodger Stadium with one game remaining. ... The Dodgers have gone 14-5 in RF Juan Rivera's 19 starts in the cleanup position. He went hitless in four at-bats.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Mark DeRosa kept glancing at the out-of-town scoreboard as he sat on the bench for seven innings. By the time he came to bat in the 12th, he'd seen the teams ahead of the Giants all win.	"If we wanted to keep any pulse, we had to win this game," DeRosa said after he hit a game-ending RBI single off second baseman Orlando Hudson's glove in the 12th inning, giving San Francisco a 3-2 victory over the San Diego Padres on Tuesday night.	"It's a tough situation, we all know that," DeRosa said. "We still want to keep playing hard and never forget we're the defending world champions. I sat there and watched the Braves win, Arizona won and the Cardinals won. We still want to finish strong and show our fans how much we appreciate their support."	DeRosa's two-out drive against Brad Brach (0-2) just evaded Hudson, allowing Cody Ross to score from third.	Pablo Sandoval and Justin Christian also drove in a run for the Giants, who have won three straight. Ramon Ramirez (3-3) pitched a scoreless inning to get the win.	Jason Bartlett had a two-run double for the Padres, who have lost five of six.	Ross kicked off the Giants' 12th with a leadoff single. He moved to second on a wild pitch and Carlos Beltran was intentionally walked. Sandoval bounced into a fielder's choice before DeRosa recorded his fifth career game-ending hit and first in four years.	"A line drive leap and just off the top of the glove," Padres' manager Bud Black said. "Probably as close as you can get."	Giants starter Matt Cain gave up one run and four hits, struck out six and walked three in 6 1/3 innings. He is 2-3 with a 2.01 ERA in his last eight outings.	"We've been playing relaxed all year," Cain said. "We weren't able to find wins at times but we're going to keep playing."	Cory Luebke struck out eight in six innings for the Padres, yielding two runs and 10 hits. The left-hander is 0-3 with a 4.28 ERA in his last five starts.	The Giants grabbed the lead in the first. Ross led off with a single, moved to third on Beltran's double and scored on Sandoval's base hit.	Sandoval and Brett Pill opened the fourth with singles. After Orlando Cabrera struck out, Christian lined a single into center to give the Giants a 2-0 edge.	"Pablo has been more disciplined up there and calmed down," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "He's worked at it. He knows if he doesn't expand the zone he'll be a better hitter."	Javier Lopez came in for Cain with a runner on first. He got pinch-hitter Andy Parrino on a groundout but gave up a double to pinch-hitter Aaron Cunningham.	Guillermo Mota took over for Lopez and Bartlett drilled his first offering to the wall in left-center field, tying it at 2.	"We had other chances along the way and we couldn't get the big hit," Black said. "It's something we've talked about all year."

ATLANTA --  Alex Gonzalez isn't too concerned about the pressure of a wild-card race.	"You have to leave it outside," he said. "You have to do your job. This time of the season, for me, pressure doesn't work."	Gonzalez hit a three-run homer and Martin Prado bunted in a run during a four-run seventh inning as the revived Atlanta Braves beat the Florida Marlins 4-1 Wednesday to maintain their lead in the NL wild-card race.	Atlanta has won two straight following a season-high four-game losing streak. The victory kept the Braves 4½ games ahead of St. Louis, which won 3-2 at Pittsburgh.	"We know we've got a great team," Gonzalez said. "We've got a great leader (in manager Fredi Gonzalez). We've got great pitching. We've got a great bullpen. I just go out there and do the best I can."	Five Braves combined on a four-hitter, and the Marlins didn't get a hit after the third or a runner after the fifth.	Cristhian Martinez, Eric O'Flaherty (2-4), Jonny Venters and rookie Craig Kimbrel each pitched a perfect inning, with Kimbrel striking out the side for his major league-leading 44th save in 49 chances.	O'Flaherty lowered his ERA two points to 1.05 ERA, best among major league relievers.	"It's not easy against their bullpen," Florida first baseman Gaby Sanchez said. "They've done a heck of a job the whole year. It's not fun going up there and having to face them."	Greg Dobbs homered in the second off Randall Delgado, and Ricky Nolasco (10-11) held the lead until the seventh.	Dan Uggla walked with one out and went to third on Brian McCann's single, the Braves' third hit. Prado squared as Nolasco released a pitch, and the ball bounced softly inside the first-base line as Uggla scored without a play. Prado wound up with a bunt single.	"I was trying to go to first the whole time," Nolasco said. "I just didn't field it cleanly. It should've been an out. Obviously, I didn't make the play. I'm pretty sure Martin thought it was an out, too, until I bobbled it. He started running after that. It's frustrating."	Fredi Gonzalez credited Prado with being fundamentally sound to keep the inning alive.	"That was a hell of an execution on his part," the manager said. "Just trying to get a run. We were running and we were able to execute."	When Prado got the safety squeeze sign from third-base coach Brian Snitker, he was only hoping Nolasco would throw a fastball.	"It's been a while since I got a bunt down," Prado said. "In that situation, you can't be too late and you can't be too early or they find out what you're doing. I always get tough pitches to bunt, like sliders. Finally, I got a fastball."	Alex Gonzalez homered on an 0-2 count with two outs, his 13th of the year. He went 2 for 3 and finished the series 8 for 11 (.727) with five RBIs against his former team.	"The last couple weeks, we've been kind of tight," he said. "But I try to do the best I can to take it day by day, inning by inning. Try to do the little things."	Game notes	 Nolasco was coming off a 13-4 win at Pittsburgh last Friday, but was 0-2 with a 9.27 ERA in his previous four starts. In 19 career games, including 18 starts, Nolasco is 5-7 with a 4.76 ERA against Atlanta. ... Mike Dunn pitched the eighth for Florida. ... Atlanta took an 11-4 lead in the season series. ... Florida will play a doubleheader Thursday at Philadelphia to make up the twinbill that was postponed Aug. 27 by Hurricane Irene. RHP Anibal Sanchez will try to win his second straight start in the first game. He pitched a 3-0 shutout last Saturday at Pittsburgh. RHP Alex Sanabia, who has never faced the Phillies, will make his first start this season in the second game. He is 3-0 with a 3.00 ERA in six career road starts. ... The Braves are off Thursday. Atlanta will start RHPs Derek Lowe, Tim Hudson and Brandon Beachy in three games this weekend against the New York Mets.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PITTSBURGH -- Wearing Hawaiian shirts as they headed out for a cross-country flight, the Pittsburgh Pirates insisted that a record 19th consecutive losing season was a year of progress.	"This isn't anything like before," losing pitcher Charlie Morton said after Wednesday's 3-2 defeat to St. Louis clinched another sub-.500 record. "The atmosphere is totally different. We were in contention for a good while. It's been a long time since that's happened."	Yadier Molina hit a tiebreaking, two-run double in the fourth for the Cardinals.	A year after going a big league-worst 57-105, the Pirates were 51-44 and led the NL Central by a half-game before play on July 20. But they have gone 16-38 since, leaving them at 67-82.	"Our how-to is going to have to get better, because we've got to get this organization to the point where we're no longer talking about consecutive losing seasons," said first-year manager Clint Hurdle, who planned the Hawaiian shirts in advance.	When the Pirates last had a winning season, Barry Bonds led them to Game 7 of the NL championship series. At times this year, it seemed like the Pirates finally were on their way to a winning season.	"They compete," Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said. "Clint and his coaching staff have done a really good job of getting their players to play hard for nine innings. They've played us tough and everybody else, too."	St. Louis, which has 13 games left, has won seven of eight and remained 4½ games behind Atlanta in the NL wild-card race. The Cardinals began the day 6½ games back of Milwaukee in the NL Central.	Edwin Jackson (5-2) allowed two runs and eight hits in 7 1/3 innings and improved to 4-0 in his career against Pittsburgh. Three relievers combined to hold Pittsburgh scoreless over the final 2 1/3 innings. Jason Motte pitched a perfect ninth for his seventh save in 10 chances.	"Anytime you can get a quality start and the team wins, it's a good day," Jackson said. "It's a game we really needed. We can't afford to lose a series."	Morton (9-10) lost his fourth straight start, giving up three runs, six hits and three walks in seven innings.	With the score 1-1 in the fourth, Molina doubled off Charlie Morton (9-10), a drive off the out-of-town scoreboard in right field.	"I was just looking to drive in a run in that situation," Molina said. "He likes to pitch me on the outside part of the plate and I got a pitch up and away that I could drive."	Derrek Lee, who went 3 for 3, pulled the Pirates within a run when he hit an RBI double in the sixth.	Rafael Furcal hit a double on the game's first pitch and scored on Allen Craig's two-out double.	Pittsburgh tied it in the second in the third when Michael McKerny led off with a double and Alex Presley doubled him home with one out.	Game notes	 Cardinals LF Matt Holliday missed the game as he returned to St. Louis to be examined after spraining his right hand Tuesday night while taking practice swings in the on deck circle in the ninth inning. Furcal, the Cardinals' shortstop, left in the fifth inning with a strained right knee sustained when he was thrown out trying to steal second base. The Cardinals were still awaiting news on Holliday after the game while Furcal said he should not miss any games. ... Cardinals INF Daniel Descalso started at third base in place of David Freese for a second straight game but La Russa said the slumping Freese will return to the lineup Friday night for the start of a four-game series at Philadelphia. La Russa played Descalso on Wednesday because left-handed batters were hitting .370 against Morton coming in. ... Pirates RHP Ross Ohlendorf (0-2, 8.03) will start Thursday night against Dodgers LHP Dana Eveland (2-0, 0.60). Ohlendorf is 0-2 with an 8.44 ERA in four starts since being recalled from Triple-A Indianapolis. Eveland allowed one run in eight innings in winning at Pittsburgh on Sept. 1. ... St. Louis is off Thursday before facing the NL East-leading Phillies. LHP Jaime Garcia (12-7, 3.68) will start the series opener for the Cardinals against RHP Vance Worley (11-2, 2.92). Garcia is 6-1 with a 1.88 ERA in 13 career starts against NL East teams.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

BOSTON --  Now comes the really hard part for the Boston Red Sox: Four more games against the Tampa Bay Rays.	The Red Sox lost for the sixth time in seven games, wasting an eighth-inning lead when Adam Loewen's two-run single off hard-throwing Daniel Bard lifted the Toronto Blue Jays to a 5-4 win Wednesday.	"It's just another loss. I don't think it's any tougher than any other loss," first baseman Adrian Gonzalez said. "We've got to find a way in the next series to play better baseball."	Just 3-10 in September, the Red Sox maintained a four-game lead in the AL wild-card race over Tampa Bay, which lost its second straight in Baltimore. Boston led the AL East at the start of the month and was nine games ahead of the third-place Rays.	After getting swept in a three-game series at Tampa Bay last weekend, Boston hosts the Rays in a four-game series starting Thursday night.	"Very frustrating," said Bard, 0-3 with a 30.86 ERA in his last three appearances. "I've been through it before. "Sometimes the effects are magnified by how big the games are."	Boston led 4-2 in the eighth before Toronto came back against the hard-throwing Bard (2-8), who entered and walked Edwin Encarnacion and Kelly Johnson.	Mark Teahen bunted, and Bard's throw to first pulled Lars Anderson off the bag for a throwing error that loaded the bases.	J.P. Arencibia's RBI groundout cut the lead to 4-3, with third baseman Kevin Youkilis bobbling the ball and throwing to first. Loewen followed with a single to center.	Loewen, converted to outfielder from pitcher, was 0-1 with a 6.63 ERA in four starts against the Red Sox for Baltimore in 2006 and '07.	"I'm very aware of that. They got me," he said, dressed in a ballerina costume as spoke to the media, part of late-season rookie hazing. "I think the best chance I had was against (Josh) Beckett in our place. I came out of the game (ahead) 2-1 in the sixth, and they ended up winning it in the top of the ninth."	Loewen has taken advantage for openings created by injuries.	"September is about taking a look at all of our personnel and he's capitalized on every opportunity, so there's no reason to think that's not going to still be in the rotation and in the mix," Toronto manager John Farrell said.	Ricky Romero (15-10) allowed four runs -- three earned -- and six hits in eight innings. He improved to 8-1 in his last 10 starts.	Frank Francisco pitched a 1-2-3 ninth for his 15th save in 19 chances as the Blue Jays won for just the third time in nine games at Fenway Park this season.	Red Sox starter John Lackey gave up two runs and seven hits in 5 1/3 innings. He threw 115 pitches.	"He had a high pitch count, mainly early," Boston manager Terry Francona said. "When he came out of the game, we had a good chance to win."	Toronto took a 2-0 lead in the first on consecutive run-scoring singles by Encarnacion and Johnson, but Boston tied it in the second when Ryan Lavarnway reached on a run-scoring error by third baseman Brett Lawrie and an RBI grounder by Jason Varitek.	Marco Scutaro hit a sacrifice fly in the third after Jacoby Ellsbury's triple, and Gonzalez homered into the Red Sox bullpen for a 4-2 lead in the sixth.	In the sixth, Varitek held on and tagged out Lawrie, who came crashing in with his forearms while trying to score from third on Adam Loewen's bouncer to second with the infield in, Varitek flipped over backward.	Game notes	 Gonzalez left with left calf tightness after his homer. He said it tightened up in his previous at-bat and bothered him on his home-run trot. "When I was rounding the bases, it got worse as I kept going," he said before saying he hoped to play Thursday. ... Lawrie left with a bruised knee. ... Red Sox DH David Ortiz missed his second straight game with muscle spasms in his back. "He really wanted to play today," Francona said. "He woke up this morning and was real sore, but he's moving around better." ... The Red Sox honored RHP Tim Wakefield with a brief on-field ceremony after he became the 108th player in major league history with 200 career wins in Tuesday's 18-6 victory over the Blue Jays. ... Francona was also honored on the field for being elected to the National College Baseball Hall of Fame earlier this year. ... Toronto SS Yunel Escobar missed both games in Boston because of a bruised left arm. ... The Blue Jays have a day off Thursday before they attempt to stop the Yankees' CC Sabathia (19-8) from winning his 20th game. Brett Cecil (4-9) is scheduled to pitch for Toronto. ... Kyle Weiland (0-1) opens the series against the Rays' Jeremy Hellickson (12-10) on Thursday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

HOUSTON -- No champagne. No wild celebration. The Philadelphia Phillies are back in the postseason for the fifth straight year, and that's exactly what they expected.	Roy Halladay pitched his 20th career shutout and Philadelphia became the first team to reach the playoffs this season with a 1-0 victory over the Houston Astros on Wednesday.	The NL East leaders clinched at least a wild-card berth and will take another run at a ring in October. Philadelphia won the World Series in 2008 and took the NL pennant in 2009.	"That's the beauty of being here," Halladay said. "We expect to win. You convert to that quickly, coming from a team where that wasn't the case. We had some big wins last year and come into the clubhouse and that's where we expected to be."	Once the Phillies signed ace pitcher Cliff Lee last winter to round out a dominant rotation, another playoff berth seemed inevitable. They said this week there would be no big party for wrapping up the wild card, and when Halladay finished off Houston he and his teammates barely cracked a smile.	Phillies players and manager Charlie Manuel simply lined up for handshakes and high-fives following their 95th win, just as if it were any other. The goal this season is a World Series championship, and anything short of that would hardly satisfy.	"It's a great mentality to have," Halladay said. "There's business to be done and until that point, there's not a lot of celebration."	Philadelphia's magic number is four for clinching its fifth straight division title.	"We want the World Series and we want to get there in a good position," Manuel said. "We want to win our division and we want to have the best record. We want to give our players the best possible position."	The Phillies, who had lost three in a row, needed a win over Houston or a loss by St. Louis on Wednesday to wrap up a playoff spot. The Cardinals beat Pittsburgh 3-2.	Shane Victorino doubled in the first inning and scored the only run on Placido Polanco's single to help Philadelphia avoid a three-game sweep.	"We went out today and played good baseball," Victorino said. "Unfortunately, we came up short a couple of innings when we had a chance to score."	Halladay (18-5) escaped trouble in the second and seventh, finishing with seven strikeouts and one walk for his first shutout of the season. The two-time Cy Young Award winner gave up six hits and threw 114 pitches for his eighth complete game of the year, tops in the NL. The game took just 2 hours, 6 minutes.	"We gave him a big cushion to work with," Manuel said, joking. "We motivated him. We came out and got him one big run. It was a good game. After we scored in the first inning, their pitching got pretty good, too."	Looking ahead, Manuel would like to see more offensive production to go with his elite pitching staff.	"The biggest thing I'm concerned about is we've got to score some runs," he said.	Houston loaded the bases in the second on Polanco's error at third, a single by Brian Bogusevic and a bunt single by Jose Altuve. The threat ended quickly when Carlos Lee was forced at home and Humberto Quintero hit into a double play.	"It really came down to us having the bases loaded in the second inning with nobody out and us not being able to get anything across," Astros manager Brad Mills said. "The guys have been putting themselves in position to have a chance to win games. Today we did that, too, but against a tough pitcher we weren't able to get those runs across early."	Halladay struck out pinch hitter Matt Downs with a runner on second in the seventh to end that threat. Downs leads the majors with 12 pinch-hit RBIs.	The Phillies spoiled a strong seven innings by Bud Norris (6-10). Victorino doubled to start the game and scored on Polanco's single.	"This was a tough one," Norris said. "Four pitches into the game and I am down 1-0. Roy Halladay is Roy Halladay. These guys played tough the whole nine innings. It was a close game, a battle."	After allowing the first-inning run, Norris retired 15 batters in a row before escaping a one-out, bases-loaded jam in the sixth. He struck out Ryan Howard with a 94 mph fastball and Raul Ibanez flied out to end the inning.	Norris gave up four hits, struck out three and walked one.	"We know this is a learning process for us, and I remember going up there last year and sweeping them in four games," Norris said. "I remember what that meant to us as a team, so I hope these guys can learn from this, build on it, and we can move forward."	Game notes	 The Phillies are 17-24 at Minute Maid Park. ... The Astros are 32-21 against Philadelphia since 2004, the best record of any NL team against the Phillies. ... The Astros currently have 16 rookies -- 10 pitchers and six position players. ... Philadelphia clinched a playoff spot in a franchise-best 146 games. The 1915 Phillies did it in 147 games.

Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

CHICAGO --  In a memorable month filled with exhilarating moments, Wednesday's comeback win stood out for the Detroit Tigers.	Carlos Guillen singled home the go-ahead run in the 10th inning and Detroit extended its longest winning streak in 77 years, rallying past the Chicago White Sox 6-5 for its 12th straight victory.	"We hung in there and had a real nice win," Tigers manager Jim Leyland said. "A really unbelievable win."	Guillen also hit a solo homer for Detroit, which hadn't won 12 in a row since 1934 -- when Hank Greenberg, Charlie Gehringer and the Tigers lost a seven-game World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals' famous Gas House Gang.	Jose Valverde struck out the side in the 10th to remain perfect in 44 save opportunities this year.	Closing in on an AL Central title, the surging Tigers rallied for three runs in the ninth off Chicago's bullpen to prevent rookie Dylan Axelrod from earning his first career win.	Ryan Raburn's pinch-hit homer with one out off Chris Sale brought the Tigers within two. Magglio Ordonez walked, chasing Sale. Alex Avila pinch-hit for Andy Dirks and hit Sergio Santos' second pitch into the seats in right-center to tie it.	The Tigers have won 22 of their last 26 games overall and 21 of 27 against the White Sox.	"We've just been on a roll and able to do it with all aspects of the game," Avila said. "The biggest thing is everybody is contributing, so that's the biggest reason why we're rolling."	Guillen, a three-time All-Star, hadn't started a game Sept. 3 -- but Leyland had no doubt the 14-year veteran would be ready to contribute.	"I'm happier for him than anybody else today," Leyland said. "He's been working like everybody else. He's a proud guy. He's a pro and he knows he hadn't played for 10 days. He wants to show people he's a very capable player. He showed that today."	Guillen hit the ball hard in all five plate appearances.	"He must have a dumb manager," Leyland said. "Dumb managers sit guys for 10 days and when they come out, they hit (five) balls hard. I must be pretty dumb."	Speaking in the middle of a jubilant Tigers clubhouse, Guillen said he's experienced this kind of scene before.	"When I was with Seattle in 2001, we won 116 games," Guillen said. "It's very similar. Similar feeling. The way the things happen, every day somebody comes through, different guys."	Axelrod struck out eight and threw six strong innings in his first career start just two years after pitching for the independent Windy City ThunderBolts.	"It's nice to get individual accolades like wins and things, but it's a team game," Axelrod said. "Unfortunately we came out on the losing end, but I was happy with what I did and just want to continue to build off that."	Santos (4-5) blew his sixth save of the season.	"It's a shame," White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen said. "(Axelrod is) pitching very well and all of a sudden we just blew it for him. Very nice day, you see this kid having success in his first time in the big leagues and all of a sudden, poof, another bad day for the White Sox."	Miguel Cabrera singled, doubled and scored a run for Detroit.	Alexei Ramirez laced a two-run double and Paul Konerko added a two-run single during Chicago's four-run second. Konerko reached 100 RBIs for the sixth time in his career.	Tigers starter Brad Penny allowed five runs -- one earned -- and eight hits over six innings. Phil Coke (3-9) threw a scoreless ninth for the win.	Ramirez doubled, singled, walked and scored a run. Alejandro De Aza doubled, reached base four times, scored two runs and stole a base for Chicago.	The 26-year-old Axelrod was starting in place of Jake Peavy, who was shut down for the remainder of the season. He appeared to be in line for the win until the ninth, when Leyland's parade of pinch-hitters pulled out another win.	"You're starting with a kid that just came from, what's the league, the independent league and he shut them down and all of a sudden these big league pitchers couldn't stop them," Ozzie Guillen said. "Look at yourself in the mirror and see how big league you are. If they're happy the season's over, good. But every time you lose a game like that and you have a little bit of pride, you should be ashamed of yourself."	The mood couldn't have been more different in the other clubhouse.	"We're having a good time," Raburn said. "We're having fun going out and playing, just trying to enjoy the moment and keep going on."	Game notes	 The Tigers can clinch the AL Central during their four-game series at Oakland this weekend. In Thursday's opener, Detroit will send Max Scherzer to the mound to face Brandon McCarthy. Scherzer has allowed just two runs in 14 innings this month. ... The White Sox travel to Kansas City for a four-games series. On Thursday, Chicago's Mark Buehrle will square off against fellow lefty Jeff Francis. Buehrle has allowed 14 runs in nine innings over his last two starts.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN FRANCISCO -- In less than two months, Carlos Beltran has been through a cross-country move to switch teams and a hand and wrist injury that landed him on the disabled list.	That left little time to think about his latest milestone: home run No. 300.	Beltran connected twice to give him 300 for his career and Tim Lincecum ended a three-start winless stretch in the San Francisco Giants' 3-1 victory over the San Diego Padres on Wednesday that completed a rare sweep in this rivalry.	"It means a lot for me, actually. Thank God for that, being able to play this game for a long time," said Beltran, both knees wrapped in ice bags and his hand sore. "Three hundred, for a guy from Manati, Puerto Rico, a small town, it's good."	Beltran became the sixth Puerto Rican-born player to reach 300 home runs.	He homered in the first inning and again in the sixth with a splash hit into McCovey Cove to put the Giants ahead. It marked the slugger's 30th career multihomer game, third this year and first since joining San Francisco in a trade from the Mets on July 28.	"Beltran is one of the best players in the National League. And he's got that in him," Padres manager Bud Black said.	Lincecum (13-12) outdueled Mat Latos (7-14) for his first win since beating the Padres on Aug. 24.	The defending World Series champion Giants began the day trailing the first-place Diamondbacks by 8½ games in the NL West. Arizona had a night game at Los Angeles.	San Francisco has its first four-game winning streak since July 9-15.	Lincecum allowed four hits and an unearned run in seven innings. He struck out six and walked two as the Giants wrapped up their first winning home series in the last eight sets since taking two of three against Milwaukee from July 22-24. September call-up Hector Sanchez caught Lincecum for the first time.	"A lot of credit goes to Sanchez for making adjustments from our first inning on," Lincecum said.	After Dan Runzler walked pinch hitter Chris Denorfia to start the eighth, Sergio Romo relieved and retired the side in order. He pumped his fist after striking out Cameron Maybin to end the inning. Santiago Casilla finished with a 1-2-3 ninth for his third save.	San Diego, which dropped its fourth straight this season at AT&T Park and sixth in seven games, was swept in a series of three or more games against the Giants for the first time since Aug. 22-24, 2008. This was San Francisco's first sweep this year since taking three in a row June 24-26 from Cleveland.	It was largely because of Beltran.	The slugger's shot into the water beyond the right-field arcade was the fourth by a Giants player this year, 59th by San Francisco overall and No. 83 in the history of the 12-year-old ballpark. Home run king Barry Bonds has 35 of them.	"He makes this park look small at times," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "I think it puts you in a really elite class -- 500 is the benchmark for guys who are going in the Hall of Fame, 300 is quite a feat. Few guys have done that."	Beltran also homered over the elevated brick wall in right to tie the game in the first. He went 7 for 12 (.583) with a double, three homers and four RBIs in the series and is batting .520 (13 for 25) with four homers in seven games against San Diego this season.	"You really have to hit the ball good in order to hit it out," Beltran said. "That's why in the dugout we always talk about what Barry Bonds did here for many years."	Kayaker Dave Edlund, a McCovey Cove regular, retrieved Beltran's 300th and also No. 299 after it hit the water on the bounce. Beltran was open to a trade with Edlund but also fine with the fan keeping the souvenir.	Whether Beltran will be hitting home runs here beyond this season is unclear. He said that will be a decision for after the season, though it's not certain the Giants will want to pay him the contract he seeks, either. Beltran can become a free agent after the World Series and is represented by Scott Boras.	"It's not my decision, but I'd be happy if he comes back," All-Star third baseman Pablo Sandoval said.	The Padres took a 1-0 lead against Lincecum on Jesus Guzman's two-out RBI double in the first.	Latos was tagged for seven hits and three runs in seven innings. He struck out eight and walked one.	Sandoval provided a big defensive stop to end the third with Will Venable on third after he stole his 26th base. Sandoval lunged to his left to field Guzman's sharp grounder, then fired to first just in time while throwing from one knee. He chuckled after doing it again on nearly an identical play on Maybin's grounder in the sixth.	"Tough as he usually is," Maybin said of Lincecum. "That's why he's a Cy Young Award winner."	Game notes	 San Diego is 4-17 in its stretch of 30 straight games against division foes. ... Longtime Padres broadcaster and former New York Yankees 2B Jerry Coleman celebrated his 87th birthday. A retired Marine Lt. Col. and Bay Area native, Coleman worked the radio booth from the fourth through the sixth innings. ... Giants rookie Brandon Belt will play five or six weeks of winter ball in the Dominican Republic to make up for time missed while he was injured this summer. Belt was sidelined after sustaining a hairline fracture in his left wrist when he was hit by a pitch from St. Louis' Trever Miller in June. The team approached Belt last month about going to winter ball. ... All-Star RHP Ryan Vogelsong (10-7) starts Thursday night for the Giants at Colorado while trying to end a five-start losing streak. ... After an off day Thursday, RHP Tim Stauffer starts for the Padres on Friday, looking for his first career win against the Diamondbacks in his fifth start and 11th appearance. ... Lincecum is 54-4 when the Giants score at least three runs for him. ... Romo appeared in all three games in the series.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Luke Hochevar had the flu. Still, the Kansas City Royals right-hander was healthy enough to curb a sickly Minnesota Twins offense.	Hochevar pitched six solid innings and Mike Moustakas had three hits and drove in two runs as the Royals defeated the Twins 7-3 Wednesday.	The Royals have won four straight, matching the longest winning streak of the season, while the Twins have lost 19 of 23 and are in last place in the AL Central after winning the division the past two years. The Twins scored 10 runs and committed seven errors in losing all five on this trip to Kansas City and Detroit.	"Hoch got the flu (Tuesday) and has been battling a low-grade fever," Royals manager Ned Yost. "After six innings, his tank was on empty. He was done."	Hochevar (11-11) gave up two runs on five hits in six innings. Hochevar improved to 6-3 in 12 starts since the All-Star break.	"Something kind of came on after we got back from Seattle." Hochevar said. "I didn't have the energy I normally have. My body felt dead and tired. It's part of it. What it comes down to it, it doesn't really matter how you feel, its how you execute. I just went out and tried to execute good pitches.	"They were real aggressive. They were swinging at first and second pitches. I let them put the ball in play and let our defense work."	Moustakas drove in runs in the second and fourth inning with singles. He doubled and scored in the two-run sixth inning.	"Moose has gotten on track really nice," Yost said. "His swings are much better. He's really driving the ball nice. The double he hit off the wall would have been a home run (Tuesday). The wind was really howling in. I didn't think you could smoke a ball to the wall today in center field and he did."	Moustakas has 19 multi-hit games and his three hits ties a career high.	"I was just happy I put solid contact on that and (Ben) Revere didn't make one of his circus catches out there," Moustakas said of his double. "My first two at-bats, I had runners on first and second, which makes my job a whole lot easier."	Jeff Francoeur also had three hits and scored two runs. Eric Hosmer, Francoeur and Moustakas -- the Royals' four, five and six hitters -- went a combined 8-for-12 and scored five runs.	Salvador Perez drove in a pair of runs with a fourth inning double and a sixth inning single.	Johnny Giavotella had two RBIs without a hit. His sacrifice fly in the second scored Francoeur. In the three-run fourth, Giavotella reached on a Trevor Plouffe throwing error, allowing Francoeur to score.	Greg Holland, one of six rookies used by the Royals, got the final two outs to log his third save in five opportunities. Yost said closer Joakim Soria has a hamstring injury and was not available.	"It's not serious, but we don't want to push it this late in the season," Yost said.	Liam Hendricks, who was making his second big league start, was roughed up for five runs on eight hits in five innings. Hendricks (0-2) was 12-6 with a 3.36 ERA in the minors before his Sept. 6 promotion.	"They're a fastball hitting team and I missed with my fastballs," Hendricks said. "I need to make better pitches with my fastball. I threw some good pitches they hit and I threw some bad pitches they hit harder. I've got to make sure I can throw my fastball with better location."	Danny Valencia, Jason Kubel and Michael Cuddyer had the Twins RBIs. Cuddyer had two hits, including a triple, and walked with the bases loaded in the seventh. Three Kansas City relievers combined to walk six in three innings.	The Twins scored 10 runs and committed nine errors in losing all five on this trip to Kansas City and Detroit.	Game notes	 The Royals started six first-round draft picks -- Hochevar, Hosmer, Moustakas, Francoeur, LF Alex Gordon and DH Billy Butler -- and Giavotella, a second-round selection. All but Francoeur, who was a 2002 first-round choice of the Braves, were drafted by the Royals. ... Joe Mauer was behind the plate for the Twins for only the second time since Aug. 20. Cuddyer and Plouffe snapped 0-for-20 skids. ...Twins CF Ben Revere stole three bases, bringing his season total to 30. ... Royals LHP Jeff Francis will make his final start of the season Thursday against the Chicago White Sox to open a four-game series. Francis has allowed 31 of his 100 runs in the first inning, when opponents are batting .358 off him. ... The Twins are off Thursday before opening a homestand Friday against Cleveland with Kevin Slowey, who is 0-5, starting.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Josh Hamilton provided a spectacular capper to the Texas Rangers' most productive inning in almost two years.	Hamilton's third career grand slam highlighted an eight-run fourth and Derek Holland pitched seven effective innings as the Rangers beat the Cleveland Indians 9-1 on Wednesday night.	Hamilton's 21st homer and Mike Napoli's 26th were the key blows off rookie David Huff (2-5) in the decisive fourth, Texas' biggest inning since an 11-run fifth against Tampa Bay on Sept. 26, 2009.	"Everybody's feeding off each other," Hamilton said. "Up and down the lineup, one through nine, there are no easy outs. We're focusing on one good at-bat at a time, and it snowballs from there."	Holland (14-5) allowed one run and six hits with six strikeouts and three walks. He has won eight of his past nine decisions, a stretch that began on July 7.	The eight-run fourth simplified Holland's job and continued strong support from his teammates. Texas averages 7.50 runs each time Holland starts, but he said he couldn't afford to relax despite the eight-run lead.	"The big thing is you can't think like that," Holland said. "You've got to go back out and pitch. You've got to stay focused ... (but) that inning was pretty exciting, awesome to watch."	Ian Kinsler also homered for the AL West-leading Rangers, who have won three straight and maintained a three-game lead over second-place Los Angeles, which beat Oakland 4-1 on Wednesday.	The Rangers are 10-1 against the Indians over the past two seasons and have outscored Cleveland 19-5 in the past two meetings.	"That's what a team that was in the World Series last year looks like, a team that will probably win their division," Indians manager Manny Acta said. "We have some catching up to do."	Lonnie Chisenhall homered for the Indians, who have lost seven of nine overall.	Huff allowed eight runs -- although only three were earned due to a fielding error in the fourth by Chisenhall at third base on Kinsler's two-out grounder -- and seven hits in four innings.	Cleveland's Shelley Duncan made two leaping catches at the wall in left field in the first inning to rob Elvis Andrus and Hamilton of extra-base hits. Then in the second inning, he made a similar catch in the same area to deny Michael Young extra bases.	"Weird, to say the least," Acta said of three standout catches in a short span by a player not known for his defense. "For three balls to go in the same spot in the first four outs, you're never done seeing new things in baseball. He made good plays on those balls."	But in the fourth, Duncan was unable to flag down Young's double into the left-field corner that scored Hamilton, who was on first with a leadoff walk. Young has 196 hits as he pursues his sixth career 200-hit season.	One out later, Napoli hit a two-run homer, a 420-foot drive that landed on the grass hitting background in center field. Andrus' infield single knocked in the fourth run of the inning.	Hamilton followed with his grand slam on a high 1-2 fastball from Huff to complete the eight-run outburst.	"He threw me a heater up, I swung and missed," Hamilton said. "I figured he'd throw it again and he did. I got just enough of the bat on it to get it out."	Huff said the pitch to Hamilton "was supposed to be a fastball down and away and I left it over the middle belt-high. He doesn't miss very many like that. You don't keep the ball down, you suffer."	Game notes	 Texas 3B Adrian Beltre's double in the second extended his career-best hitting streak to 18 games. ... The Rangers will start RHP Alexi Ogando (12-8) in Thursday night's series finale against Cleveland's Fausto Carmona (6-14). There had been speculation that Ogando's turn might be skipped or he might be sent to the bullpen after losing his past three decisions, but manager Ron Washington said the All-Star will stay in the rotation. ... Rangers OF Nelson Cruz took extra swings in early batting practice as he continues to recover from a left hamstring strain. Cruz was activated on Tuesday, and he appeared as a pinch hitter in the eighth, striking out. Cruz still won't be able to play the outfield for a few more days, although he could be used as a DH. ... Indians OF Shin-Soo Choo is expected to be activated and start on Thursday night. Choo has been on the 15-day DL since Sept. 1 with a left oblique strain. ...

BALTIMORE -- The Tampa Bay Rays couldn't hide their disappointment after losing another game to last-place Baltimore.	The Rays botched an excellent opportunity to gain ground in the wild-card race, getting only three hits over seven innings against Jeremy Guthrie in a 6-2 loss to the Orioles on Wednesday night.	After watching Boston lose to Toronto in an afternoon game, the Rays took the field with a chance to close within three games of the Red Sox in the AL wild-card hunt.	Instead, they lost a second straight game to the team with the second-worst record in the American League.	"They shut us down for two games. We can't permit that to happen," Tampa Bay manager Joe Maddon said.	Especially against the pitcher with the most losses in baseball. Guthrie (8-17) tied a career high with 10 strikeouts and allowed only two runs to win a second consecutive start for the first time this season.	"We have to figure out a way to get it done," Maddon said. "We can't miss out on these opportunities."	Next up for the Rays: Four games against the Red Sox at Fenway Park, beginning Thursday night. Tampa Bay swept a three-game series from Boston last weekend and is 9-5 against the Red Sox, including 4-1 on the road.	"Let's get out of here and get up there, get our mojo back," Maddon said.	Wade Davis (10-9) gave up a three-run homer to Chris Davis and a solo shot to Nolan Reimold. Wade Davis, who allowed four runs and seven hits in 6 1/3 innings, is 4-1 in six career starts at Camden Yards.	Matt Wieters added a two-run shot in the eighth off Matt Moore, who was making his major league debut. It was Wieters' 20th home run, the third in three games.	"Obviously, we wanted this win and last night," Rays center fielder B.J. Upton said. "But we're going into Boston for four, so we need to flush this one as quickly as we can."	If the Rays fall short in their bid to reach the playoffs, they can blame either a 1-8 start or their 9-9 record against the Orioles, who are 14-33 against the rest of the AL East.	"These guys have our number right now. They have played us well all year," Maddon said.	Guthrie improved to 6-10 lifetime against Tampa Bay, 2-3 this season. He also beat the Rays on Opening Day.	"He just kept the ball down and didn't leave it over the middle of plate," Upton said. "He has always had good stuff and he showed that today."	Jim Johnson worked the final two innings for his sixth save, the second in two nights.	Guthrie retired the first eight batters before Reid Brignac singled in the third. Reimold opened the bottom half with his 10th home run, a low-flying line drive that glanced off the top of the left-field wall and into the seats.	The lead didn't last long. Guthrie walked two of the first three batters in the fourth and Matt Joyce cleared the bases with a two-out double.	In the Baltimore half, Vladimir Guerrero beat out a slow roller to third, Wieters doubled and Chris Davis hit an opposite-field homer to left on an 0-2 pitch for a 4-2 lead.	That was enough to saddle the Rays with another distressing defeat.	"Every time you lose a game it is a lost opportunity," Rays designated hitter Johnny Damon said. "Just because it is Baltimore, we didn't let up at all. The home run ball helped them out tonight, as well as last night."	Tampa Bay's final threat came in the seventh. Damon drew a leadoff walk and took second on a single by Joyce before Guthrie sandwiched two strikeouts around a fly ball by John Jaso.	Guthrie was more delighted about playing a part in beating the Rays than he was in earning a rare win.	"We matched up well at the plate, we pitched well and got some big hits," the right-hander said. "It's a nice series."	Game notes	 Rays OF Sam Fuld left in the fifth inning with a wrist injury. ... Tampa Bay recalled LHP Alex Torres from Triple-A Durham and purchased the contract of 1B Dan Johnson from Durham, giving the team 34 players in uniform. ... The Rays' rotation for the Boston series: Jeremy Hellickson (12-10), James Shields (15-10), Jeff Niemann (10-7) and David Price (12-12). Tampa Bay has held the Red Sox to a .177 batting average, including .158 in Boston. ... Orioles CF Adam Jones (thumb) hopes to return Friday after missing a fifth straight start. He entered as a defensive replacement in the ninth. ... After a day off Thursday, the Orioles resume play Friday against another playoff hopeful, the Los Angeles Angels. Tommy Hunter (3-4) starts for Baltimore against Dan Haren (15-8).	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

CINCINNATI --  Johnny Cueto missed the beginning of the season with an injury. Now he's hurt again.	The major league ERA leader left the Cincinnati Reds' 7-2 win over the Chicago Cubs after 3 2/3 innings Wednesday night because of a strained muscle in the upper right side of his back.	"I wanted to stay in but it was sore and painful," Cueto said. "I hope I don't have to miss an outing after I'm examined tomorrow."	Ramon Hernandez hit a three-run homer in the second inning to back Cueto, who lowered his ERA to 2.31. Cueto was visited by a trainer and pitching coach Bryan Price with one out in the fourth inning. After getting Alfonso Soriano to pop out, trainer Steve Bauman and Dusty Baker went to the mound.	"I felt it pop on the pitch to Soriano," Cueto said.	Baker then removed Cueto.	"He said he felt OK, but then threw a 94 mph pitch to Soriano, but I saw him grimace," the manager said. "He didn't want to come out, but we want to do what's best for him in the long run."	Cueto, who allowed three hits, didn't make his first start of the season until May 8 because of irritation in his right upper arm.	He is six innings short of qualifying for the ERA title and is just ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers' Clayton Kershaw, who began the night at 2.36. Baker said the injury was a strained latissimus dorsi muscle.	"If it was in the joint I would be something different," Baker said. "Hopefully he can get two more starts."	Inheriting a 5-0 lead, Sam LeCure (1-1) pitched 2 1/3 innings for the win. He allowed a pair of sixth-inning runs when Carlos Pena hit an RBI double and scored on Alfonso Soriano's groundout.	Casey Coleman (2-8) gave up six runs, six hits and three walks in 3 2/3 innings. Since winning at Florida on May 19, he is 0-5 with a 7.98 ERA in eight big league starts and two relief appearances, a span that included three trips to the minor leagues.	"I didn't have command," Coleman said. "I felt like I didn't know how to pitch. I had a base open with (Juan) Francisco up. I've faced him in the minor leagues and he hit me pretty good. I've got to be able to pitch around him there."	Francisco hit a two-run single for a 5-0 lead in the third. The third baseman also turned in a defensive gem, throwing out Marlon Byrd out from foul territory in the ninth inning.	"You practice that every day," Francisco said. "I watch Scott Rolen who has seven or eight Gold Gloves."	Hernandez's 12th homer of the season but first since Aug. 5 put Cincinnati ahead. Chris Heisey added a solo homer in the eighth off Ramon Ortiz, his 16th.	Game notes	 Cubs SS Starlin Castro, who had his career-high 13-game hitting streak stopped on Tuesday, went 2-for-3 to extend to 27 his streak of consecutive games in which he's reached base at least once. ... RHP Randy Wells, scheduled to start for Chicago in Thursday's series finale, has won a career-high five straight decisions. He is 5-0 with a 3.02 ERA over his last eight starts. ... RHP Homer Bailey, Cincinnati's scheduled starter, has an 8-7 record, but the Reds are 9-10 in his starts.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK --  Stephen Strasburg isn't the only talented young pitcher wearing the curly W.	Brad Peacock pitched five impressive innings, blanking the Mets on a mere two singles and earning his first big league win Wednesday night as the Washington Nationals held off New York 2-0.	"I was pretty happy with it," Peacock said.	Peacock followed his usual routine, warming up in the bullpen and then tossing the ball to his dad. Once he reached the mound for his first start in the majors, Peacock reminded himself to do something else to settle down: "Take deep breaths."	Peacock's father and mother were waiting outside the Washington clubhouse, eager to share the moment with several family members and friends.	"We always knew major league baseball was home for him," Jerry Peacock said. "He's home."	Camera slung over his shoulder, his dad was busy all evening. Asked how many pictures he shot of his son, he said: "About 150. Maybe 1,000. I was flickin'."	Center fielder Rick Ankiel preserved this victory, making a diving catch in left-center on Jose Reyes' liner with runners at the corners for the final out. The Nationals won their fourth in a row and improved to 70-77, topping last year's win total. They also pulled into a virtual tie with the Mets for third place in the NL East -- the franchise has not finished third or higher since 2002, when it played in Montreal.	Michael Morse and Jayson Werth hit RBI singles with two outs in the third after yet another error by third baseman David Wright, sending the Mets to their fifth straight loss. Earlier in the day, Atlanta's win officially eliminated New York from playoff contention.	Peacock (1-0) was in command from the start during his second game in the majors, having made a brief relief appearance last week. The 23-year-old righty gave a performance certainly worth of Strasburg, the former overall No. 1 pick.	"I'm impressed," Nationals manager Davey Johnson said.	A 41st-round draft choice in 2006, Peacock set down the first eight New York batters before walking pitcher Mike Pelfrey on a full count in the third.	Peacock faced his lone jam in the fourth when a walk to Jason Bay loaded the bases with two outs. Pitching coach Steve McCatty strolled to the mound and did most of the talking, with Peacock nodding yes several times during the visit.	Peacock then demonstrated plenty of poise, mixing fastballs and curves before tossing a changeup that got fellow rookie Josh Satin to pop up. The Mets have been lacking key hits all season -- they left 10 runners on base and have stranded the most in the majors.	"It was awesome," Peacock said.	After 94 pitches, three walks and two strikeouts, Peacock was pulled. He went a combined 15-3 in Double-A and Triple-A this year and Johnson said Peacock would be on a short leash, but not a pitch count.	"I was right on the edge of hooking him a couple of times," Johnson said.	Tom Gorzelanny, Tyler Clippard and Drew Storen finished with shutout relief. Storen got his 37th save in 42 chances, working around a pair of leadoff walks when Justin Turner popped up a bunt back to the mound. The Mets failed on three bunt tries Tuesday night in a 3-2 loss.	"He's been known for the dramatic," Johnson said of his closer. "We've had some scares."	Pelfrey (7-12) took the hard-luck loss, leaving him with only one win in his last 10 starts. Both runs against him were unearned after Wright's fifth error in seven games.	"There were some real positives" in Pelfrey's effort, Mets manager Terry Collins said. "But like I just told him, right now you've got to be perfect. And when you're not, the way we're struggling offensively, we can't give them any support."	Reyes went 1 for 5 and never needed to test his bothersome left hamstring. The speedy star noticeably did not steal in a key spot Tuesday night, and Collins acknowledged before this game: "At times, it may not be the same guy we know."	Game notes	 Nationals 1B Chris Marrero had two hits, giving him 19 in his first 17 big league games. ... Mets RHP Chris Schwinden will start the series finale Thursday. He lost in his major league debut against Atlanta last week. Nationals LHP Tommy Milone makes his third big league start.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MILWAUKEE --  Prince Fielder says nothing has changed. That goes for his status and the state of the Brewers' offense.	Carlos Gonzalez homered and drove in three runs to lift the Colorado Rockies to a 6-2 victory over Milwaukee on Wednesday night.	Fielder, a free agent in the offseason and represented by Scott Boras, said before the game in an interview to air with TBS this weekend that this is "probably" his last season with the Brewers.	"It's the same thing I've been saying," Fielder said. "That's what you guys said last year. Probably. It is what it is."	Milwaukee's lead in the NL Central dropped to 5½ games over St. Louis, which beat Pittsburgh 3-2. The Brewers have Thursday off before a six-game road trip against division rivals Cincinnati and Chicago.	Milwaukee has cooled off since building a 10½-game lead in the division, losing six of the last eight games while St. Louis has won seven of the last eight.	"We've hit a little bump right now," Fielder said. "We're still ahead. I don't see the need for worry quite yet."	The Brewers remain in an offensive funk, scoring 16 times and batting .202 over their eight-game slump. Milwaukee is seeking its first title since winning the AL East in 1982.	"We didn't play well the last couple games. We were fortunate to win a game yesterday. There's always a concern when you're trying to get on a roll, trying to get those good at-bats going again," Brewers manager Ron Roenicke said. "We'll get out of it and start playing good ball again."	It's become an increasingly bumpy ride for the Brewers after the team had no off-the-field issues before Nyjer Morgan's antics drew the ire of the Cardinals just over a week ago. Then, reliever Francisco Rodriguez revealed Tuesday for the first time he was unhappy in the setup role before Fielder's comments came Wednesday.	Fielder said the focus remains on winning and reaching the postseason.	"We've just got to come out and win," Fielder said. "We've still got a lead, hopefully we just turn it around, but like I said, everybody's giving 100 percent, that's all you can ask for."	Catcher Jonathan Lucroy thinks the Brewers may be pressing.	"I know I'm pressing a little bit, myself. Sometimes you just try to do too much, get a little frustrated instead of relaxing and playing and you just end up hurting yourself," he said.	Kevin Millwood scattered two runs over six innings for the Rockies.	Corey Hart tripled and scored on Morgan's groundout to start the game, but that was Milwaukee's only hit off Millwood until Yuniesky Betancourt's single in the fifth.	Colorado answered with three runs with two out off Brewers Shaun Marcum (12-7) in the third. Mark Ellis singled in a run before Gonzalez's homer deep to right-center field made it 3-1.	Wilin Rosario added a solo shot -- the second homer of his career -- in the fourth.	The Rockies made it 6-1 in the fifth on Gonzalez's sacrifice fly and a fielding error by second baseman Rickie Weeks that allowed Ellis to score. The sloppy play drew boos from the crowd because Ellis had stopped at third on Jason Giambi's double before Weeks failed to cleanly catch Hart's throw from right field.	The 36-year-old Millwood (3-2) has found a role in Colorado after bouncing around the minors with the Yankees and Red Sox organizations this season. He allowed four hits and two walks over six innings in his fourth quality start since signing with the Rockies on Aug. 10.	"I can't say enough about the job that Kevin Millwood has done since he's arrived with us," Rockies manager Jim Tracy said. "He's competed extremely well. He's pitched very competitive innings. He knows what to do with a lead."	Game notes	 Weeks left for a pinch runner in the sixth.

SEATTLE --  Unheralded Luis Rodriguez put Mariano Rivera's pursuit of the major league saves record on hold.	And he kept the New York Yankees from expanding their lead on Boston in the AL East.	Rodriguez led off the bottom of the 12th inning with a solo homer off New York reliever Cory Wade, and the Mariners delayed Rivera's chase for the saves record with a 2-1 win over the Yankees on Wednesday night.	Rodriguez, who doubled in his previous two at-bats, golfed a 2-1 pitch from Wade (5-1) into the right field seats and sent the Yankees off to Toronto looking to get Rivera career save No. 601 on Friday night against the Blue Jays.	New York also missed on a chance to gain another game on the slumping Red Sox after Boston lost at home to Toronto 5-4. The Yankees lead in the AL East remained at four games.	"We lost a lot of one-run games on this trip and that's the hard part," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "We lot three games by one run each. But our club has been pretty good to win two out of three. You've got to keep doing that."	Much of the night was spent waiting to see if Rivera would get his shot at tying Trevor Hoffman's major league record, a night after becoming just the second pitcher in baseball history to reach 600 saves. And the Yankees bullpen did their part, going 3 1/3 scoreless inning and avoiding trouble on multiple occasions waiting for New York's offense to score a run and give Rivera the opportunity to pitch for 601.	It never came. Wade left a change up over the plate and Rodriguez made him pay.	"It's rough. Everybody has gone out and contributed and did what they needed to do and it came down to me and I made a mistake and it got hit out of the ball park," Wade said. "He did just what he's supposed to do with that pitch."	The Yankees only offense came from Nick Swisher's 23rd homer in the top of the seventh inning that ended a strong start from Seattle's Jason Vargas.	The Yankees had other moments taken away by the Mariners defense. Ichiro Suzuki robbed Curtis Granderson of extra bases with a leaping catch on the warning track in the top of the ninth. Michael Saunders robbed Mark Teixeira of at least a double and possible a homer with his leaping catch just in front of the wall in deep right-center field to end the 11th.	And rookie Trayvon Robinson made a difficult catch on a tough liner to judge off Brett Gardner's bat to end the 12th. Robinson's catch helped make a winner out of Seattle reliever Steve Delabar (1-0), who was a substitute teacher earlier during the baseball season before being signed by the Mariners. It was his first major league victory.	But the biggest defensive play came early when Seattle's Mike Carp was the beginning of a relay to throw out Andruw Jones at the plate trying to score on Eduardo Nunez's double in the third inning.	"It looked like (Granderson) had a game-winner and it looked like (Teixeira) had one," Girardi said. "It just wasn't meant to be."	While the Yankees missed out on the sweep, they did get an impressive showing from Nova, who was equal to Vargas. Nova threw 7 1/3 innings and gave up just five hits. Seattle's only run off Nova came in the fourth when Carp scored after Nova saw a 1-2 pitch to Miguel Olivo slip and sailed behind Olivo's head. Russell Martin did his best, but the pitch glanced off Martin's glove and bounced far enough away from the plate to let Carp score.	"It was a curve ball that fell out of my hand a little bit," Nova said. "It's going to happen sometimes."	Derek Jeter's two-out, two-strike single in the sixth inning snapped a streak of 10 straight Yankees set down and extended his hitting streak to 13 games. It also gave him 150 hits for the season, his 16th straight season with at least 150 hits. It's tied Jeter with Pete Rose for the second longest streak in baseball history with 150 hits. Hank Aaron holds the mark with 17 consecutive seasons of 150 hits.	Game notes	 Seattle 1B Justin Smoak left the game in the fourth inning with a mild right groin strain. He was replaced by Kennedy. ... The Yankees decided not to have 3B Alex Rodriguez participate in batting practice on Wednesday, but the plan remains to have Rodriguez back in the lineup on Friday night in Toronto, Girardi said. ... Seattle SS Brendan Ryan missed Wednesday's game with a sore upper back that forced him to leave Tuesday's game early. ... ... Both New York and Seattle have off days on Thursday. The Yankees open a three-game series in Toronto on Friday, while Seattle hosts Texas. ... LHP CC Sabathia will start the series opener in Toronto.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

LOS ANGELES --  Clayton Kershaw didn't get what all the fuss was about. After pitching Gerardo Parra away in his first at-bat and giving up a double, Kershaw went inside the next time and it cost him.	Kershaw was ejected for hitting Parra on the right elbow, but the left-hander still got his 19th victory and the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the NL West-leading Diamondbacks 3-2 Wednesday night to snap a three-game losing skid.	The incident was a carryover from Tuesday night's game in which Parra momentarily stood at the plate to admire his solo homer off reliever Hong-Chih Kuo that tied the game in the seventh.	Parra was annoyed Kuo had thrown an earlier pitch near his head, although afterward he said he didn't think it was deliberate.	Dodgers catcher A.J. Ellis yelled at Parra as he crossed the plate, and Kershaw shouted at Parra from the top step of the dugout. The umpires warned both benches against further trouble. The D-backs won 5-4 in 10 innings after scoring on a bases-loaded walk.	Asked if he intentionally hit Parra, Kershaw replied, "No, I didn't mean to."	Kershaw singled out plate umpire Bill Welke for ejecting him, along with manager Don Mattingly in the sixth inning.	"He's too strict," Kershaw said. "Bill is back there just trying to make sure that everything is OK. I understand that he has a job to do, but at the same time, just pay attention to the game and understand what's going on a little bit better."	Kershaw (19-5) allowed one hit over five-plus innings. After Parra's double, he retired the next seven batters in a row and then got ejected.	"I'm not disappointed at all," he said. "We got a win, it was awesome."	After Kershaw was ejected, Mattingly rushed out of the dugout to argue with Welke.	"It was leftover from last night," crew chief Tim Tschida told a pool reporter.	Tschida said Kershaw's pitch was intentional. Told that the Dodgers believed Kershaw was merely pitching inside, Tschida responded, "It's always that view."	Kershaw left the game with a 2-0 lead. There was prolonged booing as he walked to the dugout and took a seat while Mattingly kept arguing.	Mattingly said no official warnings were issued before the game, although Joe Torre, MLB's executive vice president for baseball operations, called his former team to say he didn't want anything to happen.	Asked if he thought Kershaw would be suspended, Mattingly replied, "How do you get suspended for pitching inside, hitting a guy in the elbow that's on top of the plate?"	Kenley Jansen pitched the ninth to earn his fourth save in five chances, giving up a RBI single to Miguel Montero.	Arizona's Daniel Hudson (16-10) gave up two runs and five hits in seven innings, struck out four and walked three.	"I still don't think it was on purpose," he said. "A pitch just got away from Clayton and unfortunately, it was to the wrong guy -- the guy who was in the middle of everything yesterday -- and the umpire did what he had to do."	Hudson said the D-backs were contacted by MLB beforehand and given a warning.	"We were told that if they thought there was any intent, we would be ejected and there would be some suspensions," he said.	Parra watched the verbal fray from first base, where he stood with his arms crossed and a smug look on his face.	"I was ready for that. I'm ready for anything. He's pitching, I'm hitting, and that's baseball, man," Parra said. "He's a good pitcher and he has good control, but he threw one pitch inside and then he threw another pitch that hit me. The umpire made the decision, and that's it."	He was booed in his subsequent at-bat when he nearly tied the game with a long ball that right fielder Jerry Sands caught at the wall. Ryan Roberts, who led off the eighth inning with a double, advanced to third after the catch and scored on a broken-bat grounder by pinch hitter Geoff Blum.	Kershaw tied Arizona's Ian Kennedy for the NL lead in victories, the most for a Dodgers pitcher since Ramon Martinez went 20-6 in 1990. The left-hander struck out five, giving him 236 on the season, just two behind Detroit's Justin Verlander for the major league lead.	The Dodgers took a 2-0 lead in the first on RBI singles by Matt Kemp and Sands. They added a run in the eighth on Aaron Miles' RBI single that scored Kemp, who walked and stole second, to help them avoid being mathematically eliminated.	Game notes	 It was Kershaw's second career ejection, and Mattingly's third in his first season as a manager. ... Dodgers RF Andre Ethier underwent arthroscopic surgery in a 35-minute procedure to clean up wear and tear behind his right knee cap. He's expected to begin rehabilitation in a week in Arizona, where he lives in the offseason. ... Kemp notched his 110th RBI, becoming the first Dodger to reach that mark since Adrian Beltre had 121 in 2004. ... Kershaw has won seven straight home starts and each of his past 10 decisions at Chavez Ravine, going 11-1 in 15 home starts. ... The D-backs are 9-6 against the Dodgers, who end the season with three games in Arizona.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

NEW YORK --  Boosted by the play of some blossoming youngsters, the Washington Nationals walked out of Citi Field with a series sweep and a new spot in the standings.	No wonder they're feeling pretty good about the future.	Ian Desmond had a career-high five hits and Tommy Milone earned his first major league win, leading Washington over the slumping New York Mets 10-1 on Thursday for a rare four-game sweep.	"I think you're seeing signs that we're starting to learn how to win," Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo said. "I think we're seeing a little maturation of how to play on the road and how to prepare on the road."	Desmond drove in three late runs from his leadoff spot and Ryan Zimmerman had two RBIs for the Nationals, who won their fifth straight overall and moved past the Mets into third place in the NL East.	The franchise has not finished third or higher since 2002, when it played in Montreal and ended the season in second place.	"We feel that we're going in the right direction," Rizzo said. "Our young players are getting opportunities and we're progressing. So I think it kind of shows not only our fan base, but the organization itself that we are improving. We've got some good young players and their talents in the minor leagues are starting to translate to the big leagues."	Making his third major league start, Milone (1-0) allowed one run and three hits in 5 2/3 innings. He became the second consecutive Nationals rookie starter to notch his first career victory, following Brad Peacock's 2-0 win Wednesday night.	"It feels great. It feels exactly how I wanted it to when I was a little kid," said Milone, who took three souvenir balls and a shaving-cream pie in the face from teammate John Lannan. "Hopefully, there's more games like this to come."	Wilson Ramos added three hits and three runs as Washington polished off its first road sweep of the season without even throwing prized prospect Stephen Strasburg. It was the Nationals' second four-game sweep since moving from Montreal to Washington for the 2005 season -- the other one came in Atlanta to end 2009.	"I've said it before: I think our minor league staff, as far as coaches, managers and player development, they're doing a great job of developing ballplayers," Desmond said. "They're not really out there looking for phenoms or whatever it may be. They're trying to put guys that know how to play the game from head to toe. That's the kind of guys we've got and I think the more guys that come up, the more we'll win."	After fighting through some critical injuries to stay competitive most of the season, the Mets are stumbling to the finish in September. It's an all-too-familiar refrain, even for the contending teams they fielded a few years ago.	New York has lost six straight, one shy of its longest skid this season, and finished 1-8 on the penultimate homestand of the season. The sluggish Mets (71-79) managed five runs in the four-game series and were outscored 48-26 on the homestand.	Moments after the latest loss, manager Terry Collins said he was "disgusted" with how his team has been playing and took the blame for the poor performance.	"The perception I have right now: We folded it up. And I won't stand for that," he said. "You want to see me be intense? You guys are going to see it. I don't play that game."	Third baseman David Wright committed his sixth error in six games and eighth in the last 10 before a sparse crowd of 22,205 on a dreary afternoon.	Chris Schwinden (0-2) tossed five solid innings in his second big league start but received little support on offense or defense. Struggling to drive in runners, New York has dropped eight of nine since pulling within a game of .500 and is closing in on a third straight losing season.	"Our fans should be upset. I don't blame them a bit," Collins said. "No energy, none at all, on the field. This is not the way we played all year long."	Both rookie starters remained in the game following a 40-minute rain delay in the bottom of the second.	With the bases loaded in the seventh, Todd Coffey retired Wright on an inning-ending flyout to preserve a 3-1 lead. Wright slammed his helmet in frustration.	Washington added three runs in the rainy eighth, including an RBI single by Desmond and a run-scoring double by Zimmerman.	Desmond added a two-run double in a four-run ninth against Manny Acosta.	"We definitely play with some energy here. Everybody comes ready to play, ready to win," Coffey said. "We're looking to set a precedent for next year."	Game notes	 Strasburg makes his third major league start since Tommy John surgery on Saturday night against Florida. He was pulled after three innings in his most recent outing Sunday against Houston. "I had a short leash the first two. I'm going to have a little longer leash the third time out," manager Davey Johnson said. "As far as a specific pitch count, I'm not even going there. But I'll just go with what I see and what I think he's capable of doing without a whole lot of stress." ... Peacock will get another start next week, Johnson said. ... Mets SS Jose Reyes, leading the NL in hitting, was rested. He will play all three games in Atlanta this weekend, Collins said. ... The Nationals won the season series for the first time, 10-8.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PHILADELPHIA --  Kyle Kendrick's reward for a strong start could be meaningful work as a reliever in the postseason.	Kendrick threw five sharp innings in the opener of a day-night doubleheader and the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Florida Marlins 3-1 Thursday, reducing their magic number for clinching a fifth straight NL East title to three.	Cliff Lee goes for his 17th win as the Phillies try to complete a sweep. The games are a makeup from rainouts related to Hurricane Irene last month.	Kendrick (8-6) didn't allow a hit until Logan Morrison homered to lead off the fifth. He gave up one run and one hit, striking out six.	With four aces and Vance Worley ahead of him on the depth chart, Kendrick will be back in the bullpen in October.	"Whatever they need me to do," Kendrick said. "Obviously with the stars we have here, hopefully they go deep in the playoffs."	But if the Phillies need a guy to get a tough right-handed hitter out late in a game, Kendrick is working his way into the mix.	"I could consider him," manager Charlie Manuel said.	Michael Stutes tossed two scoreless innings, Antonio Bastardo and Brad Lidge worked the eighth, and Ryan Madson finished for his 31st save in 33 chances.	Madson pitched out of a second-and-third, one-out jam by striking out Emilio Bonifacio and getting Omar Infante to foul out.	Anibal Sanchez (8-8) pitched six strong innings, but was the hard-luck loser. He gave up two runs and four hits, striking out seven.	"Everything was good, good fastball, good changeup," Sanchez said. "After (the first), I tried to keep the score close and waited for the team to score runs."	Hunter Pence and Raul Ibanez hit RBI doubles in the first, and the major league-leading Phillies (96-51) moved within six wins of setting a single-season franchise record.	Placido Polanco got the Phillies started in the first with a one-out single. He went to second on a balk and scored on Pence's double to left. Ibanez hit an RBI double to right with two outs to make it 2-0.	The Marlins cut it to 2-1 in the fifth on Morrison's 20th homer.	Ryan Webb walked Polanco with the bases loaded in the seventh to force in a run that put Philadelphia up 3-1.	The Marlins put two runners on with one out against Bastardo in the eighth. Lidge came in and allowed a single to Gaby Sanchez. But left fielder Ibanez threw out Infante trying to score for the second out.	"It's a hard call, a second-guess," Marlins manager Jack McKeon said of third-base coach Joe Espada sending Infante. "When you make that call, the guy always makes a great throw. It's a tough call. You have to make a quick decision. You don't have any time to wait."	Lidge then walked Morrison to load the bases. But he struck out John Buck to escape the jam.	A crowd of 44,216 was the 208th consecutive sellout at Citizens Bank Park, including postseason play. There were more empty seats than usual on a dreary, drizzly day.	The Phillies played without three regulars: Chase Utley, Jimmy Rollins and Carlos Ruiz. All three were expected to start the second game. Utley got a pinch-hit single in the seventh in his first action since sustaining a concussion last Wednesday. Rollins and Ruiz also came in late and hit singles.	Kendrick got plenty of defensive help from second baseman Pete Orr, who made three outstanding plays. Orr ran a long way to catch a shallow pop by Bryan Petersen in the second. He made a leaping, snow-cone catch on Sanchez's liner leading off the third. Then, he made a diving stop on Greg Dobbs' grounder in the hole in the fourth.	"Orr played a great second base," Kendrick said.	Polanco helped Stutes in the seventh with an excellent, backhanded stab on Jose Lopez's hard one-hopper down the third-base line.	Game notes	 Since Aug. 30, Florida's starting pitchers have a 2.78 ERA. ... The Phillies swept the Marlins in a doubleheader on June 15. ... The Phillies are 28-4 when Brian Schneider is the starting catcher. ... Kendrick improved to 7-2 vs. the Marlins. ... Sanchez fell to 3-8 vs. Philadelphia.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

BOSTON --  Tampa Bay Rays manager Joe Maddon spends most of his time giving signs.	On Thursday night, he went searching for one.	"You're always looking for signs, man. You're looking for signs from the baseball heaven and the baseball gods," he said after the Rays followed a fluke play with a three-run homer and beat the Boston Red Sox 9-2 to cut their deficit in the AL wild-card race to three games. "They've got to throw you signs once in a while. They've got to give you something to further the belief."	Evan Longoria hit a three-run homer and B.J. Upton and Casey Kotchman each hit two-run shots for Tampa Bay, which had trailed the Red Sox by nine games in the wild-card race on Sept. 3. But it was Upton's broken-bat RBI single that broke a scoreless tie and convinced the Rays that luck could be on their side.	With two on and two out in the third, Upton hit what would ordinarily be an inning-ending grounder toward shortstop Marco Scutaro. But the barrel of his bat arrived at the same time as the ball, and when Scutaro jumped to avoid the pointy shard he allowed the ball to go through his legs.	"Believe me, when I saw that I thought, 'Hey, let's see what's going to happen for the rest of the game,'" Maddon said. "And then the home run followed it right up."	The Red Sox dropped to 3-11 in September to fall from first place in the division to 4½ games behind the New York Yankees and into a race with the once-dismissed Rays for the wild-card. Boston and Tampa Bay play three more times at Fenway Park this weekend.	"I think enough things haven't gone our way, so I'll take it," Upton said. "We got one, and then Longo came behind me and we got a couple more."	Jeremy Hellickson (13-10) allowed one run on three hits and four walks, striking out four in 5 2/3 innings. Kyle Weiland (0-2) pitched three-plus innings, giving up four runs on three hits and two walks.	Weiland retired the first seven batters he faced before John Jaso doubled and, one out later, Desmond Jennings walked. Weiland could have been out of the inning if Upton's bat hadn't splintered.	"I kind of knew he broke his bat. But on the other hand I was just watching the ball and I figured probably the bat's going to stop somewhere in front of me," Scutaro said. "The bat just keep following the ball. At the last moment I just jumped. Nothing I can do."	Longoria followed with his 27th homer of the season, into the Red Sox bullpen to give Tampa Bay a 4-0 lead. It was 6-1 when Upton hit the first pitch he saw from Matt Albers, the fifth of seven Boston pitchers, over the Green Monster.	Although the paid attendance of 38,071 was officially the team's 705th consecutive sellout, much of the game was played under a steady drizzle and it finished with only a few thousand fans in their seats.	Game notes	 The Boston fans gave a cheer when former Red Sox star Johnny Damon was hit by a pitch in the sixth. ... Boston ace Josh Beckett (12-5), sidelined by a sprained right ankle, is scheduled to start Friday night against James Shields (15-6), who reached a career high in wins with a victory over Boston last weekend in Tampa Bay. ... Shields is 1-8 lifetime at Fenway Park. ... Shields leads the majors with 11 complete games -- the most in a season since Randy Johnson had 12 for Arizona in 1999. ... Rays manager Joe Maddon said RHP Kyle Farnsworth remained day to day with a right elbow injury. ... Former Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe was at the game. ... Jose Iglesias got his first major league hit when he singled while pinch-hitting in the bottom of the ninth.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CINCINNATI --  Jay Bruce's first game-ending home run of the season didn't have the impact of his last one. Still it reminded the Reds of the success they had a year ago.	Bruce hit a two-run homer in the 11th inning that lifted the Cincinnati Reds to an 8-6 win over the Chicago Cubs on Thursday night.	The right fielder's last game-winner came 50 weeks ago off Houston's Tim Byrdak on Sept. 28 to clinch the Central Division title.	"They're awesome," Bruce said. "It shows resiliency. It shows we haven't given up. That's my third walk off. The other two were in tighter situations but they've all been great."	Bruce's first career home run was a game-ender.	Joey Votto led off the 11th against James Russell (1-6) with a double to left-center field. Bruce connected on the next pitch for his 31st homer of the season, giving the Reds their third straight win over Chicago after losing the opener of the four-game series.	Nick Masset (3-5) pitched the 11th for the win.	The Cubs handed Francisco Cordero his first blown save since July 10 by scoring twice in the ninth to make it 6-all. Tony Campana led off with a pinch-hit single and scored on pinch-hitter Alfonso Soriano's double. One out later, Darwin Barney chopped a tying single.	Cordero had successfully converted 16 consecutive save opportunities since the All-Star break.	"We wanted to get Homer the win," Reds manager Dusty Baker said. "We figured he'd had enough. You hate to see Cordero's streak end but we'll take the win."	Reds starter Homer Bailey, who hadn't allowed more than two home runs in any of his previous 19 starts this season, gave up a pair in a span of four batters in the first inning.	"You come out there and you don't expect it to be 40 degrees," Bailey said. "I made some pretty good pitches in that inning but they hit them."	Aramis Ramirez singled with two outs and Carlos Pena followed with his 28th home run of the season, a majestic 461-foot drive on a 3-2 pitch that landed in a party area on top of the center field batter's eye.	Bryan LaHair kept the inning going with a single to center, extending his career-opening hitting streak to nine games, and Marlon Byrd hit the first pitch 414 feet into the Cincinnati bullpen in left-center field.	Bailey settled down and lasted six innings, giving up six hits and four runs with three walks and nine strikeouts, matching his season high.	"I found the release point that I needed," Bailey said.	Brandon Phillips hit his 16th home run, and fourth of the four-game series, in the third to cut Chicago's lead to 4-1. Chris Heisey hit his 17th homer, and second in two nights, in the Reds fourth.	The Reds scored three times in the fifth. Bailey started the rally with a one-out single. Phillips doubled and Drew Stubbs hit an RBI single just over the glove of a leaping Starlin Castro at shortstop.	Votto walked to load the bases, and Wells walked Yonder Alonso to force in the tying run. Jeff Samardzija relieved Wells and got Heisey to hit a sharp one-hopper that glanced off the pitcher's foot to Castro, whose throw to first wasn't in time, allowing Stubbs to score the go-ahead run.	The Reds reached Randy Wells for seven hits and five runs with two walks and three strikeouts in 4 1/3 innings. He also threw a wild pitch.	"Some nights you just get beat," Cubs manager Mike Quade said. "It's tough we played hard. Wells change up deserted him a little bit."	The Reds added a run in the sixth when Paul Janish drew a leadoff walk, moved to third on Stubbs' two-out single and scored on reliever John Gaub's wild pitch.	Game notes	 Soriano's double was the 400th of his career. ... Reds RHP Bronson Arroyo, scheduled to start against Milwaukee in Friday's series opener, is coming off the shortest start of his career. He failed to get an out in the second inning of Cincinnati's 12-7 loss Saturday at Colorado. ... Cubs RHP Matt Garza is 2-0 with a 2.53 ERA over his last three starts going into his appearance Friday against Houston at Chicago.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

PHILADELPHIA --  So close to another shutout, Cliff Lee had to settle for a team win.	Ryan Howard hit an RBI double in the 10th inning soon after Lee fell one strike short of his seventh shutout, and the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Florida Marlins 2-1 Thursday to sweep the day-night doubleheader.	The Phillies, who won the opener 3-1, reduced their magic number for clinching a fifth straight NL East title to two.	Jose Lopez spoiled Lee's shutout bid when he hit a tying home run on an 0-2 pitch in the ninth.	"Obviously, that's frustrating," Lee said. "But what can you do about it? What's done is done. You gotta get the next guy out."	Lee struck out 12 and allowed five hits in nine innings, failing to earn his 17th win.	"As long as we win," Lee said. "In that situation, I'd rather finish it off."	John Mayberry Jr. gave the Phillies a 1-0 lead when he lined a homer just inside the left-field foul pole in the sixth. It seemed that would be enough for Lee, who now has fallen one out shy of a shutout in two of his last four starts.	Michael Schwimer (1-0) tossed a scoreless 10th for his first career win.	Michael Martinez walked to lead off the 10th against Burke Badenhop (2-2). Howard then lined a 3-1 pitch deep to left-center and the speedy Martinez scored easily.	"I was just looking for something up, something to shoot over to left field," said Howard, who entered in the top of the 10th.	In the opener, Kyle Kendrick threw five sharp innings for the Phillies.	Kendrick (8-6) didn't allow a hit until Logan Morrison homered to lead off the fifth. He gave up one run and one hit, striking out six.	Lee, the 2008 AL Cy Young Award winner, lowered his ERA to 2.38. His latest gem came a day after Roy Halladay beat Houston 1-0. Halladay, the reigning NL Cy Young Award winner, Lee and the Dodgers' Clayton Kershaw are the top three candidates for the award this season.	Lee has twice been the NL Pitcher of the Month this year. He was 5-0 with a 0.21 ERA in June and 5-0 with a 0.45 ERA in August.	"Not too many chances against that guy," Marlins manager Jack McKeon said. "He's pretty good, has great command, mixes his pitches, works fast and knows how to pitch."	The major league-leading Phillies (97-51) moved within five wins of setting a single-season franchise record.	Alex Sanabia allowed one run and six hits in six innings in Game 2. Anibal Sanchez (8-8) pitched six strong innings, but was the hard-luck loser in the opener. He gave up two runs and four hits, striking out seven.	Kendrick's reward for a strong start could be meaningful work as a reliever in the postseason. With four aces and Vance Worley ahead of him on the depth chart, Kendrick will be back in the bullpen in October.	"Whatever they need me to do," Kendrick said. "Obviously with the stars we have here, hopefully they go deep in the playoffs."	But if the Phillies need a guy to get a tough right-handed hitter out late in a game, Kendrick is working his way into the mix.	"I could consider him," manager Charlie Manuel said.	Michael Stutes tossed two scoreless innings, Antonio Bastardo and Brad Lidge worked the eighth, and Ryan Madson finished for his 31st save in 33 chances.	Madson pitched out of a second-and-third, one-out jam by striking out Emilio Bonifacio and getting Omar Infante to foul out.	Placido Polanco got the Phillies started in the first with a one-out single. He went to second on a balk and scored on Hunter Pence's double to left. Raul Ibanez hit an RBI double to right with two outs to make it 2-0.	The Marlins cut it to 2-1 in the fifth on Morrison's 20th homer.	Ryan Webb walked Polanco with the bases loaded in the seventh to force in a run that put Philadelphia up 3-1.	The Marlins put two runners on with one out against Bastardo in the eighth. Lidge came in and allowed a single to Gaby Sanchez. But left fielder Ibanez threw out Infante trying to score for the second out.	Lidge then walked Morrison to load the bases. But he struck out John Buck to escape the jam.	Kendrick got plenty of defensive help from second baseman Pete Orr, who made three outstanding plays.	Game notes	 Lee reached double digits in strikeouts for the ninth time this season. ... Phillies 2B Chase Utley made his first start in the nightcap since sustaining a concussion last Wednesday. ...

ARLINGTON, Texas --  With Michael Young standing on deck for the Texas Rangers already with 98 RBIs, the Cleveland Indians opted to walk Josh Hamilton.	Giving that free pass to Hamilton and loading the bases in the fifth inning only briefly delayed a big blast by the AL West-leading Rangers.	Young delivered a three-run double to go over 100 RBIs for the second time in his career, and Adrian Beltre immediately followed with a two-run homer as Texas went on to a 7-4 victory Thursday night, completing a three-game sweep and extending its division lead to 3½ games over the idle Los Angeles Angels.	"I don't take those things personally. I just try to focus on my job," Young said. "At that point we're really making sure we're trying to push one across. I was just trying to get something to the outfield. Worst-case scenario, sacrifice fly scores a run."	Texas (86-64) moved to 22 games over .500 for the first time since 1999, and will now play nine of its final 12 games on the road, starting Friday night at Seattle.	Cleveland's loss cut Detroit's magic number for clinching the AL Central to one. The Tigers lost 6-1 at Oakland later Thursday.	"All you can think is you failed to achieve your goal, which is to win the division," Indians manager Manny Acta said. "You play to win the division. So you get your head up, play for second place or above .500. You have to shift gears and have another goal."	Young's bases-clearing double off Fausto Carmona (6-15) gave him 101 RBIs. Beltre followed with his 25th home run for a 6-0 lead.	Hamilton hit his 22nd homer in the seventh.	The 40th double of the season for Young, now primarily the Rangers' designated hitter, pushed him within two RBIs of his career high set five years ago. Young is only three hits shy of his seventh 200-hit season.	"What a year," manager Ron Washington said. "It doesn't matter where I put him in that lineup, he delivers."	Endy Chavez opened the Texas fifth with an infield single before his second stolen base of the game. Ian Kinsler then walked before Elvis Andrus' sacrifice bunt brought up Hamilton, the reigning AL MVP who hit a grand slam Wednesday night after also going deep in the series opener.	"Like any team that has depth, pick your poison," Washington said. "I think any manager would have did what he did, not pitch to Josh. But he had to deal with Michael, had to deal with Beltre."	Alexi Ogando (13-8) allowed only two singles while throwing six scoreless innings. The All-Star right-hander struck out four and walked two while winning for the first time in a month. He had been 0-3 in five starts since his last win Aug. 15 at the Angels.	Ogando was nearly flawless, except for a 39-pitch second inning when he got out of a bases-loaded jam with consecutive strikeouts after both of his walks. He faced the minimum three batters the other five innings he pitched, getting Ezequiel Carrera to ground into an inning-ending double play after Jason Kipnis singled in the sixth.	Washington said Ogando's "competitive juices" kicked in after he probably came within one batter of making an early exit.	"Sometimes during the game you have times like that during an inning. I was going too much to my left side on my fastball," Ogando said through an interpreter. "That's why I couldn't control those pitches. You can't do anything else. You have to think about what you were doing wrong. When they came and talked to me, that's what happened. I was able to fix it and worked my way to do it."	Ogando had already thrown 52 pitches after he struck out Lonnie Chisenhall and Lou Marson to get out of the second. He needed only 40 more pitches to get through the next four innings, and had his longest outing in his past five starts.	Carmona, an AL All-Star last season, is 0-3 with a 6.97 ERA over his past six starts. Against the Rangers, the right-hander struck out three, walked five, and gave up seven hits and five earned runs over six innings. He also threw a wild pitch.	Texas got its first run after Chavez had a leadoff single in the third to snap his 0-for-13 slide. He then got to third on a stolen base and a throwing error by catcher Marson before scoring on a single by Andrus.	Shelley Duncan had a bloop RBI single with two outs in the seventh off Darren Oliver for the Indians' first run.	Game notes	 The Rangers went 9-1 against Cleveland this season, outscoring the Indians 68-32. Texas has won 21 of 25 in the series over the past three seasons. ... Andrus has hit in all 23 of his games against Cleveland. ... Texas had only nine hits, ending its club record streak of consecutive 12-hit games at seven. ... Cleveland scored twice in the ninth off closer Neftali Feliz, who was pitching for the first time since Saturday. ... Actor Jonah Hill, a co-star in the upcoming movie "Moneyball," threw out the ceremonial first pitch. ... Texas is 49-29 at home.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Billy Butler had the big hit -- a three-run homer -- while Melky Cabrera had four hits, including a home run and a historic double.	Butler three-run homer in the sixth propelled Kansas City to a 7-2 victory over the Chicago White Sox on Thursday night for the Royals fifth straight victory.	The loss officially eliminated the White Sox from the playoffs.	"It's a very disappointing, very inconsistent season," White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen said. "I have regrets. Regrets we didn't play better. I thought we had a better shot to win the division. Detroit earned it with the way they've played."	The Royals' five-game winning streak is their longest since they won five straight from Sept. 7-11, 2009.	Butler was in a 2-for-27 skid coming into the game.	"I've had a string of a bad week or so," Butler said. "It's good to come out of it. I hit that ball good and did some damage with it. I had a couple of more opportunities. Up and down the lineup we're doing well. We're picking each other up."	Cabrera's four-hit game matched a career high and his double in the sixth was his 40th as an outfielder -- he has one as a DH. The Royals are the first team in major league history to have three outfielders with 40 or more doubles. Alex Gordon and Jeff Francoeur both have 45.	"When you look at our outfield offensively, the first time in the history of the game three outfielders have 40-plus doubles and add that to the fact that the same outfield is leading all of baseball in assists (with 50), they are a pretty special group," Royals manager Ned Yost said.	"The three outfielders have been the cornerstone of our team. They are the veteran guys. They provide all the leadership. They provide a big chunk of the offense and a big chunk of the defense."	Cabrera raised his average to .303.	"Melky has been a huge addition," Butler said. "The way he played tonight was unbelievable. That's the way he's been all year. He's been very consistent. You can pretty much look at any game and he's made a difference for us offensively."	Butler's 19th home run in the sixth inning came off Mark Buehrle (11-9), who has lost five of his last six starts. Buehrle, who gave up a career high 15 hits, left in the seventh inning after being struck in the left biceps by an Alcides Escobar line drive. Buehrle said he does not anticipate he will miss his next start.	"It's fine," he said. "I could have stayed in, but there's no reason when you're getting your fanny handed to you."	Buehrle has a career 22-12 career record against Kansas City.	"Its feast or famine, that's the way it is with him," Butler said. "Throughout his career, it's been more feast for him than us. It's good to get one from him. It took a shot off his arm to get him out of there. He's given us a lot of tough times in the past."	Cabrera homered in the first, while Butler scored on Salvador Perez's two-out single for the second run of the inning.	Left-hander Jeff Francis, who was 1-5 in his previous seven starts, allowed two runs, eight hits and two walks in six innings. Both runs off Francis (6-16) came on sacrifice flies -- by Alex Ramirez in the third and Tyler Flowers in the sixth.	"Look at his full body of work over the course of the year and he's pitched much better than his record will indicate," Yost said. "He's had a real solid year."	Every Royal had a hit except for Gordon, who walked twice. Perez's three hits matched his career high, while Yamaico Navarro drove in two runs with a single and a sacrifice fly.	The White Sox opened the sixth with singles by Paul Konerko, Alex Rios and A.J. Pierzynski, but Francis limited them to one run on Flowers' sacrifice fly.	Game notes	 Royals RHP Luke Hochevar is being shut down for the remainder of the season after throwing a career-high 198 innings, 90 more than last year when he missed 2½ months with an elbow injury. Hochevar finishes with an 11-11 record and 4.68 ERA. The Royals are 5-0 when Navarro is the starting third baseman. White Sox C Ramon Castro, who went on the DL on July 10 with a broken right hand, is rehabbing with the team in Kansas City. RHP Phillip Humber, who starts Friday for the White Sox, pitched last year for the Royals, going 2-1 in eight games, but only one start. RHP Felipe Paulino, who allowed two hits and two runs in seven innings in beating Seattle 4-2 on Saturday, will start for the Royals.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DENVER --  When Pablo Sandoval saw Carlos Gonzalez crash into the wall he knew he had a chance at history, so he turned on his afterburners.	"When I saw him fall down, that's when I started running hard," Sandoval said. "Halfway between first and second that's when I thought I had a chance to make it."	Sandoval slid headfirst into third base with a triple to complete the first cycle of his career and the San Francisco Giants beat the Colorado Rockies 8-5 on Thursday night to keep their slim postseason hopes alive.	The Giants have won five straight and prevented Arizona from moving closer to clinching the NL West. The Diamondbacks lead the Giants by seven games with 12 to play.	"We've got a chance," Sandoval said. "You never know what's going to happen."	Sandoval did his part to keep the Giants alive with his career night. He homered in the first, doubled in the second and singled in the fifth. He said he wasn't thinking about the cycle when San Francisco came to bat in the sixth.	The rest of the team knew what he needed.	"I was rubbing his legs saying, 'Hey, I've got to get these things loose for a triple,'" manager Bruce Bochy said. "He said, 'Nah, I'm not even thinking about it.' Sure enough he hit the perfect ball. It's a great game for Pablo. It's quite a feat."	Sandoval is the 25th Giant to hit for the cycle and the first since Fred Lewis accomplished the feat May 13, 2007, also at Coors Field. It is the 10th cycle recorded at Coors Field.	The four hits all came against starter Jhoulys Chacin (11-12).	"He hit everything I threw," Chacin said. "He hit a homer with a fastball, the base hit was a changeup. (The double) was off the plate and down and he just put the bat on it and he hit it to the other side. It was his night."	It was all starter Ryan Vogelsong needed to end a personal five-game losing streak. Vogelsong pitched effectively into the sixth inning and had two hits.	"I wouldn't get too excited about those two hits, but I'll take them," he said.	The Giants gave him an early lead to work with thanks to Sandoval's bat and poor fielding by the Rockies.	San Francisco went ahead 2-0 in the first when Carlos Beltran singled with two outs and Sandoval homered into the second deck in right, his 20th.	The Giants used two Colorado errors to extend the lead in the second. Brandon Crawford scored on a throwing error by shortstop Tommy Field. Jeff Keppinger hit a sacrifice fly and Jordan Pacheco misplayed Beltran's grounder at first, allowing Cody Ross to score from second to make it 5-0.	The Rockies got one back in the third when Chacin scored from third on Mark Ellis' single. Pacheco made it 5-2 when he led off the fourth with his second home run.	San Francisco made it 7-2 in the sixth on an RBI double by Ross, who scored on a double play grounder by Beltran.	"It was great to jump on top like that," Vogelsong said. "Definitely takes some of the pressure off."	Vogelsong (11-7) allowed two runs and four hits, walked four and struck out eight in 5 2/3 innings.	Santiago Casilla pitched the ninth for his fourth save.	Colorado scored three runs in the seventh on Chris Iannetta's 13th homer and RBI doubles by Chris Nelson and Eric Young Jr.	Brandon Belt led off the ninth with his sixth homer to make it 8-5.	Chacin gave up seven runs -- four earned -- and nine hits, walked four and struck out one in 5 2/3 innings.	Game notes	 Sandoval is the second player to hit for the cycle this season. Milwaukee catcher George Kottaras did it against Houston on Sept. 3. ... Gonzalez left the game in the seventh after aggravating his right wrist on Sandoval's triple. ... Rockies SS Troy Tulowitzki (hip) and 1B Todd Helton (back tightness) missed their second straight game. ... Giants closer Brian Wilson (right elbow strain) threw a side session Thursday. ... Left-hander Madison Bumgarner will face Colorado rookie right-hander Alex White on Friday in the second game of the four-game series. Bumgarner is 0-3 in five starts against the Rockies while White has never faced the Giants.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  Jim Leyland sat in his office, his lucky cigar resting unlit in a nearby ashtray. He's going to throw the unused portion away -- and get a clean change of underwear -- now that his team's 12-game winning streak came to an end.	"I'll still smoke some of it," Leyland said. "It's a $40 cigar and was a gift after all."	David DeJesus hit a three-run homer in the first, Brandon McCarthy pitched seven strong innings and the Oakland Athletics snapped Detroit's longest winning streak in 77 years with a 6-1 victory on Thursday night, delaying the Tigers' chance to clinch the AL Central Division title.	"We have 12 games left to win it," Tigers starter Max Scherzer said. "You have to like our chances. But we haven't won anything yet."	Leyland will get a new change of underwear when his team goes for their first outright title since 1987 on Friday night. He said before the game that he had not changed (nor washed) his underwear during the 12-game winning streak.	"It wasn't anything we did or didn't do," Leyland said. "We just got beat. We were ready to play but their pitcher has figured out the art of pitching. Give him all the credit."	The Tigers have not finished first since taking the AL East nearly a quarter-century ago. Their only playoff appearance since then came in 2006, when they won the wild card.	Delmon Young hit a home run for the Tigers, who saw their magic number drop to one when the Cleveland Indians fell to the Texas Rangers 7-4 earlier in the evening. The Tigers need any combination of a win or a Cleveland loss over the final 12 games to clinch the division.	"We still have to get one more somehow," Leyland said. "It was a nice streak but that's over and we have to finish it."	Kurt Suzuki and Cliff Pennington each hit a solo home run for the A's, who won for the second time in five games. Coco Crisp added three hits and drove in a run.	McCarthy (9-8) allowed one run on five hits to improve to 3-2 with a 2.15 ERA over his past five starts. He walked two and struck out eight.	"As a team you never want to see people celebrating on your home field," McCarthy said. "For us it's just getting wins and playing well. If we happen to spoil guys on the way there, that's great."	Scherzer (14-9) lasted five innings, giving up five runs on seven hits. He walked one and struck out eight.	"We've been playing good ball as of late and we're still playing the best baseball of the season right now," Scherzer said.	Leyland said the impressive fact about the streak was that it included wins over the Indians and Chicago White Sox.	"It was a critical part of the season," Leyland said. "We stepped up to the plate against the teams right behind us. To beat those two teams, that's pretty good."	DeJesus ended a 79 at-bat homerless streak with his three-run shot with two outs in the first. Crisp, who returned to the lineup after missing several games with an ankle injury, singled to lead off. He was forced at second by Pennington. After Hideki Matsui fouled out, Scherzer walked Josh Willingham ahead of DeJesus.	Suzuki led off the second with a home run and Pennington led off the fifth with a homer. Crisp doubled home a run in the eighth.	"It was a cold night, too," said A's manager Bob Melvin, who made his major league debut with the Tigers in 1985. "It ended up being a good power night for us. We do have some power, and we've been better in the second half but this ballpark can be tough to hit home runs in."	Young's home run made it 4-1 in the third.	Magglio Ordonez extended his hitting streak to 13 games with a first-inning single but Ramon Santiago went 0-for-3, ending his nine-game streak.	The A's (22-20) and Tigers (22-19) had similar records following game action on May 17. The teams have gone in notably different directions since.	Detroit was eight games behind the Indians and four games under .500 on May 3. The Tigers have played .625 ball since and are on the verge of becoming the sixth team since 2000 to win a division title after being behind by at least eight games at some point in the season.	Game notes	 The last time the A's played a team on a 12-game winning streak was at Baltimore in 1999. ... RHP Trevor Cahill (11-13, 4.32) goes for the A's on Friday night. The former All-Star is 3-6 with a 6.86 ERA in 11 starts since the All-Star Break. He beat the Tigers on April 17, allowing one run in eight innings. ... Scherzer recorded his career-high 14 strikeouts in 5 2/3 innings against the A's in May. ... Doug Fister (8-13, 3.06) makes the start for the Tigers on Friday night. He has been outstanding since joining the Tigers, going 5-1 with a 2.28 ERA. He is 4-0 with a 0.74 ERA in his past five starts. ... A's IF Jemile Weeks (leg cramps) was out of the starting lineup for the second straight day as a precautionary measure.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.	Jhoulys Chacín has agreed to a guaranteed $1.25 million, one-year contract with the Rockies.

LOS ANGELES --  Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle was blunt in his sitdown with Ross Ohlendorf: throw the ball lower, throw strikes and do it now.	Knowing his tendency to overthink things, Ohlendorf appreciated the simplicity.	He got his first win of the season in seven starts and hit a three-run homer to help the Pirates beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 6-2 Thursday night, a loss that mathematically eliminated the bankrupt franchise from the NL West race.	"His fastball and slider were very efficient and the ball was down in the zone," Hurdle said. "Ross hasn't had a lot to feel good about."	In his previous start, Ohlendorf lasted just two innings and allowed six hits against Florida.	Ohlendorf (1-2) allowed two runs and four hits in seven innings, struck out six and walked none. It was the right-hander's fifth start since rejoining the team on Aug. 23 after a stint on the disabled list with right shoulder discomfort.	"It's been a while since I've pitched like that," Ohlendorf said. "It's by far the best I've felt since I got hurt the first time. I feel like I'm finally getting back to what I'm capable of doing."	Ohlendorf won for the first time on the road since Aug. 11, 2009, at Colorado. He tweaked his delivery, using a bigger motion that kept his mind focused.	"Hurdle and I had a talk earlier in the week about wiping the slate clean and starting over. Hearing that come from him really helped," he said. "A big thing too was forcing myself not to overthink about the hitters in terms of which pitches to throw."	All-Star Joel Hanrahan got pinch-hitter Aaron Miles to fly out to left field with the bases loaded in the ninth to earn his 38th save in 41 chances.	Dana Eveland (2-1) gave up four runs and eight hits in five innings, struck out four and walked one. The left-hander made 35 pitches in the second when the Pirates batted around while scoring four runs.	"Unfortunately, I got outdueled," Eveland said. "Ohlendorf threw the ball really well. He hadn't won in a long time, but he broke that streak, so congratulations to him."	Brandon Wood's RBI single tied the game at 1-1 and Ohlendorf followed with his first career homer and first career RBIs on the first pitch from Eveland to make it 4-1. Ohlendorf hit to the opposite field with two outs on a cool, damp evening at Dodger Stadium and got mobbed by his teammates back in the dugout.	"The guy does have lumberjack power. He is lumberjack strong," Andrew McCutchen said. "It was just a matter of him running into one. I'm not surprised by his power, I've seen his batting practice. He hits balls as far as anyone."	In the bottom of the second, Ohlendorf needed just nine pitches to get out of the inning.	The Pirates added two runs in the eighth on a RBI double by Ryan Doumit and a RBI single by Ryan Ludwick.	The Dodgers' runs came on Justin Sellers' ground-rule double in the first and Russell Mitchell's homer in the fifth.	The Dodgers lost for the fourth time in five games since briefly reaching the .500 mark last Saturday. They were eliminated with 12 games remaining in a troubled season that has included the beating of a San Francisco Giants fan on opening day, the franchise filing for bankruptcy and the ongoing battle between Frank McCourt and his ex-wife over ownership of the team.	The Dodgers' lineup included just two regulars -- Matt Kemp and James Loney. Kemp went 0 for 3 and got hit by a pitch, dropping him to 3 for 14 on the homestand. Loney was 0 for 4.	Game notes	 Dodgers RF Andre Ethier was at the ballpark a day after having arthroscopic surgery on his right knee. ... Ohlendorf became the first Pirates pitcher to homer since Paul Maholm on May 9, 2009, against the Mets. ... The Pirates' 34th road win equaled their most away from home since 2002. Last season, they won just 17 on the road. ... Dodgers C Tim Federowicz made his first major league start and singled in the fifth for his first major league hit. ... The Pirates ended a three-game skid against the Dodgers. ... Eveland made his first start at Chavez Ravine.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

CHICAGO --  The Cubs finally caught a break.	Matt Garza pitched nine strong innings and Marlon Byrd's 12th-inning dribbler was ruled fair, giving him an infield single and lifting Chicago to a 4-3 victory over the Houston Astros on Friday.	"We don't do anything the easy way around here," manager Mike Quade said of the Cubs, who were coming off an 11-inning loss in Cincinnati on Thursday night.	Starlin Castro set up the winning rally with a leadoff walk, went to second on Darwin Barney's sacrifice, and moved to third on a wild pitch. He scored when third baseman Chris Johnson couldn't handle Byrd's dribbler up the line.	"I think I set a record for the shortest walk-off hit ever," Byrd said.	The Astros argued that Byrd's hit should have been a foul ball and replays suggested they were correct.	"I was right over top of it, so I had a really good look," Johnson said. "Once I saw it hit foul I just tried to make contact with it because the ball's dead, you know? ... We'll just move on. People make mistakes."	Garza was one strike from finishing off a five-hitter when Carlos Lee hit his second home run of the game, a two-run shot into the left-field bleachers that tied it at 3-all. Garza said he decided to challenge Lee with a fastball.	"It is what it is, man," Garza said. "It's one of those situations where I said, 'Here's my best. What do you got?' He guessed right and beat me.	"I knew where I had to put that pitch for him not to hit it. I just left it up the middle and he got it."	Nevertheless, it was a solid outing for Garza, who struck out four and threw a season-high 124 pitches, allowing seven hits and no walks. Jeff Samardzija (7-4) threw a scoreless 12th to pick up the win and send the Astros to their 99th loss.	Before this season, Houston had never lost more than 97 games in the franchise's 50-year history.	"They're tough losses, but on the other hand, you have to look at the positives," Lee said. "We're playing good baseball. We're playing good games."	Geovany Soto led off the third with his 15th homer, and Aramis Ramirez had three hits, including his first triple since July 9, 2010.	"(Rodriguez) left me a fastball right there and I put good wood on it," Soto said.	Lee had three hits and three RBIs for Houston. He opened the scoring with a solo blast leading off the second. Lee has hit in 22 of his past 24 games, and has 23 career homers at Wrigley Field, third among active players.	"I would say since the All-Star break, I've been feeling pretty good," Lee said. "I've found a position where I feel real comfortable and I'm seeing the ball real good."	Astros starter Wandy Rodriguez allowed three runs and six hits over 5 2/3 innings, striking out five and walking four. He is two strikeouts shy of becoming the first Astros lefty to record 1,000 in a career. Reliever David Carpenter (0-3) gave up the winning run.	The Astros swung early and often against Garza, who faced the minimum in five different innings and no more than four until the ninth. After allowing J.D. Martinez's leadoff single in the fourth, Garza retired the next 13 Astros in order.	"For the main part, (Garza) threw the ball unbelievable today," Soto said.	The long game was bad news for a Cubs squad weary after Thursday night's four-hour defeat. The Cubs were tired, but mustered enough energy to mob Byrd after his game-winner.	"They had plenty of energy, punching me in the stomach," Byrd said. "I just held my ground. We felt pretty good today. It's one of those things, we got in late but you have to get up for every game."	Game notes	 Castro went 0-for-4 with two walks and remains seven hits shy of becoming the youngest Cub to reach the 200-hit mark. ... The Cubs opened their homestand Friday afternoon after finishing their road trip with the extra-inning loss at Cincinnati on Thursday night. It's the kind of scheduling crunch Quade would like to avoid given the ordinance that requires the Cubs to play day games on Fridays. "I don't know if it's a doable deal, but obviously you'd like to play a day game somewhere else before coming home," he said. ... Actor Martin Sheen performed during the seventh-inning stretch, singing "Take Me Out to the Ballgame." ... The Astros will send Henry Sosa to the mound on Saturday to face Chicago's Rodrigo Lopez.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

BALTIMORE --  Knowing that every loss puts their playoff hopes in further jeopardy, the Los Angeles Angels played a clunker of a game against the last-place Baltimore Orioles.	Starting pitcher Dan Haren struggled in his second-shortest outing of the season, the offense was silent until the ninth inning, and the Angels also made a costly error in an 8-3 defeat Friday night.	Los Angeles remained 3½ games behind first-place Texas in the AL West and dropped five games behind Boston in the wild-card race.	"A lot of things they did on the field better than we did," manager Mike Scioscia said. "We have to play at a higher level."	After the Angels fell behind 8-0, Scioscia pulled every one of his position players except third baseman Alberto Callaspo.	"No message," the manager said. "At this part of the season, in a game like that, we needed to get some young legs out there and let these guys regroup."	Tommy Hunter (4-4) pitched seven shutout innings for the Orioles, who have become spoilers of late. Baltimore took two of three from wild-card hopeful Tampa Bay before easily handling the Angels, who had won eight of 11 coming in.	"We'd like to finish strong no matter who it is out there," Hunter said. "It's not one of those things where we're going to play harder against one of these teams or that team. This team is young. We want to go out there and play, no matter who it is."	Nolan Reimold and Mark Reynolds homered for Baltimore, now 2-5 against Los Angeles this season.	The Angels avoided a shutout in the ninth against Kevin Gregg, who allowed a two-run homer to Hank Conger and an RBI double to Alexi Amarista.	"We lost. It's very concerning," outfielder Torii Hunter said. "We didn't play like a team that is in the pennant race."	Tommy Hunter gave up seven hits, struck out five and walked two in his most impressive outing since coming to Baltimore on July 30 from Texas. He came in 1-4 with an 8.79 ERA in seven career games against Los Angeles.	Haren (15-9) yielded seven runs and seven hits in five-plus innings.	"Everyone knows that every game is important. I feel terrible," the right-hander said. "We have some games to make up and time is running out."	Haren got into trouble in the second, when the Orioles manufactured two runs on one hit. Reimold walked, stole second and scored on Robert Andino's single. A sacrifice bunt and a wild pitch got Andino to third, and he came home on J.J. Hardy's groundout.	Baltimore made it 5-0 in the fifth. After Reynolds led off with his 33rd homer and Andino got an infield hit, Callaspo let a grounder go through his legs for an error. Hardy followed with a two-run double.	Any hope the Angels had of a comeback ended in the sixth, when the Orioles increased the lead to 8-0. Chris Davis led off with a single and Reynolds doubled to chase Haren. Tyler Chatwood entered and threw a wild pitch, allowing Davis to score, and Reimold followed with a drive to left on an 0-2 pitch.	Game notes	 Orioles CF Adam Jones was a late scratch with a sore thumb. He has missed six straight starts, and manager Buck Showalter said Jones will get an MRI on Saturday. Jones' absence provided Reimold a chance to play. ... Reynolds' homer ended an 0-for-21 skid. ... Los Angeles was averaging 6.8 runs per game against the Orioles. ... RHP Ervin Santana (11-11) will start for the Angels on Saturday against rookie Zach Britton (9-10). Santana has won five straight road starts but has a 6.75 ERA at Camden Yards.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

WASHINGTON --  If this is the end of Javier Vazquez's career, he's ending it on a high note.	The Marlins' right-hander threw his first complete-game shutout in more than six years Friday night to lead Florida to a 3-0 win against the Washington Nationals.	Vazquez (11-11) allowed five hits for his eighth career shutout. His last came as a member of the Arizona Diamondbacks in a 1-0 win at Detroit on May 22, 2005.	Vazquez is in his 14th season and has hinted he's leaning toward retiring at the end of the year, although he said he'll wait until after the season to make a final decision.	"The way I'm pitching right now is not changing what I've been thinking for the last couple years," he said. "You've got to know what you want."	As the end of the season approaches, Vazquez is only getting stronger. After opening the season with a 3-7 record and 6.85 ERA in his first 14 starts, Vazquez is 8-4 with a 1.97 ERA in his last 16.	In the past four games he's been even better, allowing just one run in 29 innings.	"I've always kept working hard and tried to battle through all the struggles, and it worked," Vazquez said.	Against Washington, Vazquez threw 104 pitches, struck out seven and did not walk a batter. He only allowed baserunners in three innings, and retired the final eight hitters. It was the 27th complete game of his career.	"What a great job that Javy did," Florida manager Jack McKeon said. "We keep seeing him getting better and better every outing. The guy's just been an inspiration to some of the guys around here. If they can't get anything out of that pitching clinic tonight, they're in trouble."	Washington only put together any real offense in the second and seventh innings, but both times baserunning mistakes cost the Nationals.	In the second inning, Rick Ankiel singled with one out. Danny Espinosa followed with a single to left center, but was thrown out trying to stretch it to a double and the inning ended with Ankiel stranded at third.	Washington led off the seventh inning with a pair of singles, but Vazquez struck out the next two batters and catcher John Buck ended the inning by picking off pinch runner Brian Bixler at first.	"He used a lot more fastballs than I think we're used to seeing from him. He was hitting his spots," said Nationals shortstop Ian Desmond, who was 0 for 4. "We had a couple situations where we could have scored some runs, but he pitched lights out."	Washington starter John Lannan (9-13) lost for the sixth time in seven starts and the Nationals ended a five-game winning streak.	In the second inning, Lannan walked Gaby Sanchez and Bryan Petersen with one out, then threw a wild pitch before Buck hit a run-scoring single to give the Marlins a 1-0 lead.	Omar Infante and Mike Stanton hit consecutive doubles to lead off the third, and Sanchez sent Stanton home with a two-out single for the second run of the inning.	The Marlins had baserunning trouble of their own as they tried to add an insurance run in the ninth. With one out and runners on the corners, Matt Dominguez grounded to third. Bonifacio was caught in a rundown between third and home, and after he was tagged out catcher Wilson Ramos threw to second to catch Stanton for the double play.	Stanton had an RBI double and two singles for the Marlins, who had lost their previous four games.	With Vazquez on a hot streak, McKeon said he hasn't lobbied for his pitcher to return next season.	"If he's made up his mind, you wouldn't want the guy to come back and not be 100 percent dedicated," McKeon said. "I don't know. I haven't talked to him about it. He's still got a couple starts left, and we hope to get a couple more wins out of him."	Game notes	 Nationals OFs Jayson Werth and Michael Morse were given the day off as Roger Bernadina (cut on left hand) and Laynce Nix (strained right groin) returned to the starting lineup. Nix had been limited to pinch-hitting duties since Sept. 1 and Bernadina last started on Sept. 4. ... The win was McKeon's 277th as manager of the Florida Marlins, passing current Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez for the top mark in team history. ... Nationals RHP Stephen Strasburg (0-0) will make his third start Saturday since returning from Tommy John surgery. He will go against Marlins RHP Chris Volstad (5-12).	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

PHILADELPHIA --  An unlikely hero emerged for surging St. Louis as the Cardinals kept alive their playoff push while putting the Philadelphia Phillies' title celebration on hold.	Adron Chambers drove in the go-ahead run with his first major league hit and Tyler Greene added an RBI double in the 11th inning to help St. Louis beat Philadelpha 4-2.	"It was a great example of what we've been doing," Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said. "The guys were outstanding. We hung in there and got a great win. It was a huge moment for Adron and Tyler Greene got a big hit."	St. Louis appeared to have the game won in the ninth, but Corey Patterson dropped Carlos Ruiz's drive to right with two outs allowing the tying run to score.	The Phillies (97-51), who have already clinched no worse than the wild card, saw their magic number cut to one for winning their fifth straight NL East title when second-place Atlanta lost to the New York Mets 12-2.	"We didn't do enough hitting tonight to get there," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said. "We're going to clinch. I like our position. Nobody's scared. We're going to do it."	Yadier Molina homered and Albert Pujols went 4-for-4 for the Cardinals, who have won eight of nine and closed within 3½ games of the Braves for the NL wild card lead. St. Louis remained 5½ back of Milwaukee in the NL Central.	"We'll see if we can ride this," La Russa said.	Kyle McClellan (12-6) pitched a scoreless 10th, and Fernando Salas earned his 24th save in 29 chances with a scoreless 11th.	Chambers, batting for the second time in his career since his Sept. 6 callup, lined a single to right off Michael Schwimmer (1-1) to score Rafael Furcal and give St. Louis a 3-2 lead. Greene followed with a double off the top of the wall in left to plate Pujols and put the Cardinals up two runs. Chambers was tagged out at the plate trying to score from first.	"It was a real thrill," Chambers said. "I'm really happy about it. The situation came up for me. I was able to get the job done. Right now I'm just trying to play hard. These guys have been here all year so I'm just trying to help as much as I can.	"I hope another chance comes up so I can do it again."	The Cardinals were leading 2-1 with two outs in the ninth when Ruiz drove in the tying run with a drive to right field. Patterson, a defensive replacement, got to the ball in time but it went in and out of his glove just inside the line in deep right to allow pinch runner Michael Martinez to score. The play was first ruled a hit before being changed to an error.	Martinez was running for Philadelphia slugger Ryan Howard, who was not in the starting lineup for the fourth time in nine days with a nagging ankle injury, but came on with two outs in the ninth and doubled to right, just beating Patterson's throw with a headfirst slide. It was the second straight big pinch-hit for Howard, who drove in the winning run in Thursday night's 2-1, 10-inning victory over Florida.	"We would've liked to have done it tonight but we look at the positives and move forward," Philadelphia center fielder Shane Victorino said. "We were able to come back and we didn't give up. We'll look at the positives and come back tomorrow."	St. Louis appeared on its way to victory when Molina broke a 1-1 tie with a solo homer in the eighth off the foul pole against Antonio Bastardo. The Cardinals catcher also gunned down John Mayberry Jr. at second with an impressive throw in the seventh.	"You've just got to see him every day," La Russa said of Molina. "I've never seen anyone better."	Bastardo, who has been surprisingly dominant this season, has struggled of late. Beginning Sept. 3 when he took his first loss of the season at Florida, the Philadelphia left-hander has allowed five runs on four hits while walking three in his last five appearances.	Jaime Garcia pitched seven strong innings and kept the Phillies batters off-balance all game, allowing just one hit outside of the second inning when Philadelphia managed four hits, including two infield singles, and one run. The left-hander was in line for his 13th victory, which would have matched his career high for wins in a season. He finished with four strikeouts against two walks.	"I'm pleased with what I did and glad we got the win," Garcia said. "We've got something special going on and the main thing is to win for the team."	Phillies starter Vance Worley pitched six solid innings, allowing one run on six hits while striking out five and walking three. The NL Rookie of the Year candidate was coming off Sunday's 3-2 loss at Milwaukee that snapped a streak of 14 games in a row won by the Phillies in his starts. His record remained at 11-2 while his ERA dropped slightly to 2.85, from 2.92 entering the game.	The Cards took a 1-0 lead in the second when Worley walked in a run, but the right-hander escaped further trouble when he got Allen Craig to ground out with the bases loaded for the final out.	Mayberry, starting in place of Howard, hit an RBI double in the bottom of the frame to tie it at 1, but the Phillies also stranded the bases loaded when Jimmy Rollins popped out to second.	Philadelphia remained five wins shy of setting a single-season franchise record for victories.	Game notes	 The Phillies have scored three runs or less in their last eight games, going 4-4 in those contests. ... La Russa recorded his 1,400th career victory. ... Cardinals outfielder Matt Holliday missed his second straight game with an inflamed tendon on his right middle finger. ... Pujols has now reached safely in 32 straight games. ... The Phillies' crowd of 45,572 was their 197th regular-season sellout and 210th in a row counting postseason. ... St. Louis' Jake Westbrook (12-8, 4.61) is scheduled to face Roy Oswalt (7-9, 3.88) in the second game of the four-game series at 7:05 Saturday night.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

TORONTO --  With October drawing near, CC Sabathia is struggling.	Sabathia failed to hold a fifth-inning lead and Jose Molina's single in the ninth lifted the Toronto Blue Jays over the Yankees 5-4 Friday night, keeping Mariano Rivera on hold at 600 saves.	"They made (Sabathia) work tonight," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "I didn't think his command was as good as it has been. He had some really good innings and then he had some innings where he struggled."	New York lost its second straight game on the last at-bat since Rivera got his 600th save Tuesday at Seattle, moving within one of Trevor Hoffman's career record.	The Yankees, whose AL East lead over second-place Boston was cut to 3½ games, lost for the sixth time in nine games and dropped to 3-5 on a 10-game trip that concludes with weekend games at Toronto. New York then returns to Yankee Stadium for a homestand that originally was five games but has swelled to eight because of rainouts.	Sabathia won seven straight starts and nine of 10 from June 14 to Aug. 1. He's 3-3 with a 4.56 ERA in eight starts since.	"My arm feels good, my body feels good," Sabathia said. "It's just been not executing pitches when I need to."	This is just the second time this season the Sabathia has gone two starts without a win. He also did it Aug. 6 and 12.	"Command has been a big issue, but my stuff has been there," he said. "That's what's so frustrating."	Sabathia failed to earn his 20th win for the second straight start. The Yankees ace needed 120 pitches to get through 5 2/3 innings and matched season-highs by allowing 10 hits and walking four.	"I still think CC is going to run off some good starts, I really do," Girardi said. "He just hasn't been quite as sharp. He went late into a lot of games for us. His innings have piled up."	Ahead 3-1, Sabathia allowed a three-run double to Adam Lind in the fifth. Nick Swisher's RBI single tied it in the sixth, but Lind doubled off Boone Logan (5-3) leading off the ninth. Molina, who played for the Yankees from 2007 to 2009, singled with one out off Cory Wade.	"I thought when we got the 3-1 lead we were going to win that game," Girardi said. "Jose got a pitch up in the zone and didn't miss it."	Lind came in batting .178 (13-for-73) in his past 18 games, but left feeling good about his big double off Sabathia.	"You couldn't do it against a better team or a better pitcher," Lind said.	Casey Janssen (5-0) pitched two scoreless innings as Toronto won for the fourth time in five games.	"We didn't miss pitches when they were on the plate," Blue Jays manager John Farrell said.	Jose Bautista, 0-for-19 against Sabathia coming in, singled in the first to put runners at the corners, and Edwin Encarnacion hit into a run-scoring forceout.	Swisher's RBI double and Eric Chavez's second homer of the season, a two-run drive, put the Yankees ahead 3-1 in the third against Dustin McGowan.	McGowan started in place of Brett Cecil, who was scratched because of a cut left index finger sustained while cleaning a blender Wednesday. McGowan allowed three runs and three hits in a season-high five innings.	"Tonight was the sharpest of the three outings he's had," Farrell said.	Game notes	 Yankees 3B Alex Rodriguez (left thumb) missed his sixth straight game but was expected to return to the lineup Saturday. ... Toronto has won six straight one-run games. ... Cecil is to start Tuesday against the Los Angeles Angels. ... Sabathia made his 100th regular-season appearance with New York. ... Yankees manager Joe Girardi said C Francisco Cervelli is still bothered by concussion-like symptoms stemming from a Sept. 8 collision with Baltimore's Nick Markakis. Cervelli, who is not traveling with the team, saw a neurologist Friday and will undergo more tests next week. ... Toronto OF Colby Rasmus returned to the lineup for the first time since injuring his right wrist on Aug. 23. ... Blue Jays SS Yunel Escobar (bruised left elbow) missed his fourth straight game. ... The retractable roof at Rogers Centre was open during batting practice but began to close during the first inning.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BOSTON --  The Boston Red Sox waited for Josh Beckett to recover from his sprained right ankle before letting him get back on the mound.	And he returned to the rotation just in time.	In his first start in 11 days, Beckett pitched six solid innings to lead the Red Sox to a 4-3 victory over Tampa Bay on Friday night, slowing the charge of the third-place Rays and extending Boston's lead in the AL wild-card race to four games. It was the second win in nine games for the Red Sox, and their first in seven tries against the Rays.	"We need him to be Beckett. We don't need him to be Beckett in name only," Red Sox manager Terry Francona said. "Despite what's been happening, we want him to have a chance to pitch effectively. So we weren't going to pitch him unless he was ready."	The Rays trailed Boston by nine games on Sept. 3 and had a chance to catch them with a four-game sweep in Fenway. But trade-deadline pickup Mike Aviles broke a fourth-inning tie with his first homer since joining the Red Sox, and Boston assured itself of the wild-card lead at least through the end of the weekend.	"As tough as the last 10 days have been, playing in this atmosphere -- this is why they work all winter," Francona said. "This is exciting. I was as nervous as can be."	Jonathan Papelbon pitched the ninth for his 30th save -- his first since Aug. 18 -- striking out Evan Longoria with a runner on second to end the game. But the best news might have been the performance of Daniel Bard, who rebounded after three straight losses to strike out three in a scoreless eighth.	"I don't know what anybody else is saying, but he's Daniel Bard. I want him pitching the eighth every game I start for the rest of my career," Beckett said. "I don't know if that's going to happen, but I'd like my chances."	James Shields (15-11) lost for just the second time since July. Longoria homered for the second straight night, and Desmond Jennings had three hits for the Rays.	Boston ace Jon Lester faces Jeff Niemann on Saturday.	Beckett (13-5) left his Sept. 5 start with a sprained ankle and skipped his next turn in the rotation. He allowed three runs -- two earned -- on Friday night, giving up seven hits, an intentional walk and a hit batter while striking out seven. He fanned John Jaso with a runner on third to end the sixth -- a called strike that got Rays manager Joe Maddon ejected.	"We're still in good position if we can get tomorrow's and Sunday's game. That still puts us in pretty good shape," Maddon said. "But it was made much more difficult tonight with the actions of the home plate umpire."	In two previous starts against Tampa Bay this season, Beckett pitched 17 scoreless innings, allowing just a pair of infield singles. But he ran into trouble early on Friday when Jennings led off the game with a bunt single and took second on Beckett's throwing error; two batters later, Longoria homered off the top of the Green Monster.	The Red Sox tied it in the bottom half on RBI singles by Dustin Pedroia and David Ortiz. The teams matched runs in the third before Aviles, who was acquired from the Kansas City Royals on July 30, sent one off the billboard behind the Monster Seats -- his first homer since joining the Red Sox.	"He got a pitch he could reach and he whacked it," Francona said. "I don't care who hits them right now. It was nice seeing that ball leave the ballpark."	Shields allowed four runs on seven hits and three walks, striking out four in seven innings.	Longoria also saved a run in the field when he dove to his right to snare Pedroia's liner and essentially landed on third base, doubling off Aviles to end the seventh.	Game notes	 Game 3 of the four-game series is Saturday, with LHP Lester (15-7) facing RHP Niemann (10-7). It could be the only game in the series with a pitching matchup that favors Boston. Lester will be trying to atone for his last performance -- four innings pitched in a 9-1 loss to the Rays last Sunday. ... Beckett, who started his career with the Marlins, earned his 1,000th strikeout with the Red Sox when he fanned Ben Zobrist in the sixth. ... Maddon was ejected arguing a called third strike. Earlier, B.J. Upton argued a called third strike, and Maddon rushed out of the dugout to get between him and home plate umpire Hunter Wendelstedt. ... An odd play in the top of the eighth: Johnny Damon was hit by a pitch, but the Red Sox appealed to third base umpire Bob Davidson, who said he swung at the pitch for strike three. ... The Red Sox allowed a season-high seven stolen bases, three by Damon and two by Jennings. ... The Rays fanned 15 times and went 2 for 13 with runners in scoring position.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CINCINNATI --  Ryan Braun celebrated 30-30 and helped the Milwaukee Brewers start their final push toward a first NL Central title.	Braun homered twice and became only the second player in Brewers history to get 30 homers and steals in a season Friday night, setting up a 6-3 victory that eliminated the Cincinnati Reds from playoff contention.	Braun hit one of Milwaukee's four homers off Bronson Arroyo (8-12), then added his 30th off reliever Jeremy Horst. Braun, who also has 31 steals, joined Tommy Harper as the franchise's only 30-30 players.	"I'm really proud," Braun said. "There's a reason it's only been done one other time in franchise history. It's a hard thing to do."	So is finally nailing down that title.	The Brewers led by 10½ games on Sept. 5 but allowed the Cardinals to stay in it by dropping six of their last nine. They're on pace to clinch next week in Chicago.	After the win, most of the Brewers stood around in the clubhouse and loudly cheered Philadelphia's late rally against the Cardinals. They had a sense things were headed in the right direction. The Cardinals eventually won in 11 innings.	"That's been the goal all year, to go out with a bang," said Prince Fielder, who hit the first of Milwaukee's five homers. "Hopefully we got it back on track. Tonight was a good start."	Fielder, Braun, Mark Kotsay and George Kottaras homered off Arroyo, who has given up a club-record 44. Milwaukee had seven hits, five of them homers.	Left-hander Randy Wolf (13-9) gave up three runs and seven hits while pitching into the eighth inning. Joey Votto had three singles and drove in all the Reds' runs. John Axford pitched the ninth for his 43rd save in 45 chances. He has converted 40 in a row, a club record.	Milwaukee reduced its clinching number to seven -- Brewers wins or Cardinals losses.	"We'd been playing so well," Fielder said. "Unfortunately it (the slump) happened at the time we were trying to separate really far. We're still in good position, though. There's no need to panic, in my opinion."	The loss eliminated the defending NL Central champions from the wild-card race. The Reds opened the season by sweeping three games from Milwaukee at Great American Ball Park and won their first five overall but couldn't find the consistency that led them to the title last year. They were in second place or worse after May 18.	Arroyo came down with mononucleosis during spring training and never totally recovered, setting up a strange season. The right-hander has given up 44 walks and 44 homers. He's six homers away from the major-league record and wouldn't want to skip a start to avoid it.	"You don't want to cower like that," Arroyo said. "At the end of the day, the only way you lose is if you lose heart. You leave your guts on the field. You have to go out and not try to give up four or five home runs."	Fielder's 33rd homer extended his hitting streak to nine games. The first baseman caused a mild stir earlier in the week by telling TBS that this was "probably" his last season with the Brewers, and he wanted to go out "with a blast."	Kotsay hit a two-run shot in the third inning, only his third of the season. Braun followed with his 29th on the next pitch, the third time that Arroyo has given up back-to-back homers this season. Kottaras' solo shot in the seventh marked the second time that Arroyo gave up four homers in a game this season.	Votto singled home a run in the first inning. Wolf retired 13 in a row before leaving with the bases loaded in the eighth, when Votto had a two-run single off Francisco Rodriguez.	Game notes	 Harper had 31 homers and 38 steals in 1970. ... Bert Blyleven gave up a major-league record 50 homers for Minnesota in 1986. Jose Lima set the NL record by allowing 48 in 2000 with Houston. ... Reds C Ryan Hanigan was unavailable because of back spasms. ... RHP Yovani Gallardo will make his third start of the season against Cincinnati on Saturday. He is 0-0 with a 6.55 ERA so far. The right-hander is 2-3 in 10 career starts against the Reds. ... Cincinnati's Edinson Volquez makes his second start since he was recalled from Triple-A. The right-hander lasted only five innings Sunday in Colorado and took a loss.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ATLANTA --  Derek Lowe looked down as he heard boos while walking off the field in the third inning, and he spoke in unusually soft, pained tones following the game.	A long season is wearing on Lowe just when the Atlanta Braves most need his veteran leadership.	Lowe suffered his shortest start in two years as David Wright drove in five runs with two homers, leading the New York Mets to a 12-2 win over the Braves on Friday night.	The loss cut Atlanta's lead over St. Louis in the NL wild-card race to 3 1/2 games.	Lowe knows he is needed because the Braves are missing Jair Jurrjens and Tommy Hanson from their rotation.	"I've said my whole career hitters will tell you how your stuff is," Lowe said after giving up nine hits and six runs in only 2 1/3 innings. "It was just a lot of hits. It was just terrible. That's all you really can say."	The Mets, responding to criticism from manager Terry Collins, matched their season high with 20 hits and ended a six-game losing streak.	Lowe (9-15) lost his third straight start. The right-hander had his shortest outing since also lasting 2 1/3 innings on June 14, 2009, at Baltimore. His ERA rose to 4.94.	"This has been a long year," he said. "I mean, this is probably my worst year I've ever had. Right now you obviously feel discouraged and frustrated and all those things, but next time around you've got to find a way to figure it out because this is just bad pitching for too long."	Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez said he still has confidence in Lowe. Gonzalez has few options as his rotation already includes three rookies: Brandon Beachy, Mike Minor and Randall Delgado.	Hanson, who has a sore right shoulder, has a throwing session planned for Saturday. He could be sent to the Instructional League next week with the hope he'll return to the Braves before the end of the season.	Asked if there is time for Hanson, who has been on the disabled list since Aug. 7, to pitch in the playoffs, Gonzalez said "Possibly. It'll be close."	Jurrjens has a bone bruise on his right knee. Asked if Jurrjens has a chance to be ready for a division series, Gonzalez said "Probably not."	The Braves have 11 games remaining in the regular season. The Cardinals gained ground by beating the Phillies.	Chris Capuano (11-12) gave up two runs on six hits in five innings to earn his second win in three weeks against the Braves. He pitched a two-hit shutout in a 6-0 win over the Braves in New York on Aug. 26.	Lowe gave up a two-run homer to Wright and a two-run single to Ruben Tejada in the first inning. He left after giving up Jose Thole's two-run single for New York's fourth hit of the third inning.	Rookie Julio Teheran gave up Wright's three-run homer and Nick Evans' run-scoring single in the fourth.	Lucas Duda had four hits for New York. Wright, Evans, Jose Reyes and Thole each had three hits.	"The way we've been swinging the bats, if we can score more than one it's a good night for us," Wright said. "Hopefully, this is the start of something."	Martin Prado hit a homer in the second off Capuano. Michael Bourn tripled and scored on Chipper Jones' fly ball in the first.	Capuano pitched out of a fifth-inning jam after pinch-hitter Antoan Richardson singled and moved to third on Bourn's single. Following a visit from pitching coach Dan Warthen, Capuano struck out Jones, Freddie Freeman and Dan Uggla.	After a 10-1 loss to Washington on Thursday ended a 1-8 homestand, Collins said "The perception I have right now: We folded it up. And I won't stand for that."	Before Friday's game, Collins said he believed his team's problem was execution, not effort.	"We didn't need any extra incentive," Capuano said. "We all know what's going on. We're all proud individuals."	There were two strong defensive plays.	Mets left fielder Jason Bay reached over the wall to take a home run away from Alex Gonzalez to end the fourth. Bay fell to the warning track before taking the ball out of his glove to show he made the catch.	Alex Gonzalez returned the favor in the seventh when he went deep into the hole at shortstop to field a grounder from Bay. Gonzalez, still running toward third, turned and made a leaping throw that barely beat Bay to first base.	Game notes	 Bay was 0 for 17 in his career against Lowe before his single in the third. He walked in the first. ... Prado's homer was his first since Aug. 9. ... Lowe's 15th loss matched his career high set with the Dodgers in 2005. ... RHP Tim Hudson, who leads the Braves with 14 wins, will face R.A. Dickey on Saturday. Dickey is 1/3 with a 4.54 ERA in nine career games, including six starts, against Atlanta. His one win came on June 5 in New York. ... Collins announced Capuano's next start will come Thursday at St. Louis, instead of Wednesday, as had been planned. RHP Chris Schwinden will start against the Cardinals on Wednesday.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Eric Hosmer delivered the game-winning hit after the Chicago White Sox opted to walk Billy Butler to face him.	Hosmer had three hits and doubled in the winning run in the ninth inning to lift Kansas City to a 7-6 victory over the White Sox on Friday night that extended the Royals' winning streak to six games.	His liner over the head of left fielder Juan Pierre scored Alex Gordon, who led off the inning with a single. After Melky Cabrera's sacrifice bunt moved Gordon to second, Billy Butler was walked intentionally.	"Billy is one of the better hitters in this league," Hosmer said. "It's a smart thing to do with a lefty on the mound and a lefty on deck. I kind of knew it was coming."	Hosmer fouled off Matt Thornton's first pitch before his double on the next offering.	"He throws a lot of fastballs and throws so hard," Hosmer said. "You've just got to sell out on that with him. After that first one, I was pretty late. Fortunately enough I got the hit over his head and we win the ballgame.	"I knew I hit it pretty good. (Pierre) was kind of drifting back. I was just hoping at that point. Then I finally saw him leap up and the ball get under. It's just a great feeling, six in a row and try to keep this thing rolling."	It was the 12th walk-off victory for the Royals, but their first since July 23. Hosmer was mobbed by teammates on the field.	"I got beat up pretty good," Hosmer said. "You're just so happy when you get a walk-off win. You can't even feel it. You just look for the bruises later."	The last time the Royals won six consecutive games was May 2-7, 2009.	"Hopefully we can keep this streak up and go into the offseason looking good," Gordon said. "We know we're not in the race, but we're still going out and playing hard and trying to win games. Nothing has changed. Just because we're out of the race, doesn't mean we're not going to compete."	Hosmer, Jeff Francoeur and Mike Moustakas, the fourth, fifth and sixth hitters, combined to go 9-for-13 with five RBIs and scored four runs.	Greg Holland (5-1) worked the ninth to pick up the victory. Thornton (1-5) took the loss in the White Sox' sixth straight defeat.	"I like being in the game in crunch time," Holland said.	Moustakas, who had a minor league-leading 36 home runs last year, hit Philip Humber's 2-1 pitch into the right-field bullpen for his third home run with Francoeur aboard in the fourth. After going 281 at-bats without a home run, Moustakas has hit two in his past three games.	Francoeur singled home Butler in the first and Hosmer in the fourth. Francoeur led off the sixth with a single off Humber's hip, advanced to third on Moustakas' single and scored on Johnny Giavotella's fielder's choice grounder. Butler drove in Gordon with a first-inning single.	"It got me in the hip," Humber said. "It hit me pretty squared up."	Royals starter Felipe Paulino allowed three runs on seven hits, while walking three and striking out three. He left with a 6-3 lead that the bullpen failed to hold.	Humber, who was 1-0 with a 1.26 ERA in his previous three starts, gave up six runs on nine hits and two walks, while striking out four in six innings in a no-decision. That matched the most runs Humber had permitted this year.	"Besides the home run to Moustakas, he threw the ball pretty good," White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen said. "I think we should put up a screen when he's pitching. It's scary. Every time he goes out there, man, the ball's close to him. He threw the ball well. He had a tough time late in this game. I left him in there to solve his problem, and he did a pretty good job."	A.J. Pierzynski, who had three hits Thursday, drove in two of the White Sox' runs with a sacrifice fly in the first and a single in the seventh.	The White Sox tied it at 6-6 in the eighth on Brent Morel's two-run homer off Royals rookie left-hander Tim Collins.	Alexei Ramirez had three singles and drove in a run in the fifth for the White Sox.	Game notes	 White Sox DH Adam Dunn is 3-for-84 against left-handers, an .036 average. He has struck out 161 times, which is the second-highest total in franchise history. Dave Nicholson holds the club record with 175 in 1963. ... The Royals have four players with 80 or more RBIs -- Francoeur 80, Butler 89, Gordon 85 and Cabrera 82 -- to match a club record. It was the fifth time in franchise history they had four players drive in 80 runs. They last accomplished that in 2002 with Carlos Beltran, Raul Ibanez, Mike Sweeney and Joe Randa. ... White Sox rookie RHP Zach Stewart will make his 10th start of the season Saturday. He lost his only start to the Royals on Aug. 12 at Chicago, allowing two runs and seven hits in 6 1/3 innings. ... Rookie LHP Everett Teaford will make his second big league start Saturday. He threw five scoreless innings Sunday to win at Seattle.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Jim Thome spent less than two seasons in Minnesota, hitting 37 home runs, including historic No. 600.	He returned to Target Field as a visitor for the first time on Friday night, and Twins' fans had a chance to show how much they appreciated his short tenure in a Minnesota uniform.	Thome was given a standing ovation prior to his first at-bat, and was applauded again even after hitting home run No. 603. The drive helped the Cleveland Indians beat the Twins 7-6 Friday night to keep the Detroit Tigers, at least for a few hours, from clinching the AL Central title.	"Getting a chance to come here and play here for the two years I did was very special," Thome said. "The crowd has always been great here. They really have. It's been a joy. A little different competing against them, but that's part of the game too."	Thome homered in the ninth inning against Joe Nathan for a 7-4 lead, just Thome's second home run since Cleveland reacquired him on Aug. 25. The 41-year-old spent his first 12 seasons with the Indians.	"That would only happen to a guy like him," Indians manager Manny Acta said of the cheers. "To be doing what they were doing today, even in the first at-bat it seemed like they were pulling for him to hit a ball out when he first hit that fly ball to left field. He gets what he deserves. He's such a great guy, and the fans here appreciate his time here."	Thome's 22 home runs are the most at Target Field, now in its second season, and he has six of the eight longest homers in the ballpark's history.	The Twins showed a video tribute of Thome before his first at-bat, and he was greeted with a standing ovation before flying out to the left-field warning track. Thome went 2 for 4 with a walk and two runs.	"No matter what team you're on, he walks up to the plate and you're always interested in watching him," Minnesota manager Ron Gardenhire said. "He got us tonight, but we've seen him get lots of people, and he's gotten us before. It's nice to see him back in town, but I'd still like to end up with a win and shake hands."	Detroit, which played at Oakland, would have clinched the division title with an Indians' defeat. Minnesota, which has dropped into last place, has lost six straight and 11 of 12. The Twins have scored just 21 runs in their last 11 games.	Backed by a 5-0 lead, Ubaldo Jimenez (4-2) allowed three runs -- none earned -- and five hits in 6 1/3 innings. Obtained from Colorado at the trade deadline on July 31, he improved to 3-1 with a 2.78 ERA in his last five starts after going 1-1 with a 7.29 ERA in his first four outings for the Indians.	"It means a lot for me, especially the way I started the season," Jimenez said. "The first two, three months of the season wasn't easy for me. Being able to finish strong means a lot."	Minnesota had runners reach in each of the first five innings but couldn't score until center fielder Grady Sizemore allowed Rene Tosoni's well-hit fly ball to glance off his glove for a two-run error in the fifth.	Despite allowing a pair of runs in the ninth, Chris Perez got three outs in his 33rd save in 37 chances.	Carlos Santana hit his 24th homer, a solo drive in the second against Kevin Slowey, and Lonnie Chisenhall and Lou Marson each had two hits and pair of RBIs as Cleveland ended a three-game losing streak.	Slowey (0-6), winless since last Sept. 18, gave up five runs and seven hits in four innings.	Game notes	 Minnesota DH Jason Kubel left with left foot pain after going 0 for 2. ... Gardenhire announced after the game that SS Tsuyoshi Nishioka would miss the rest of the season because of his right oblique strain. Nishioka last played on Sept. 9. ... Santana's home run gave him 30 extra-base hits since the All-Star break, seventh most in the AL during since the break, and 43 of his last 78 hits have been for extra bases. ... The Twins activated LHP Francisco Liriano (left posterior shoulder strain) from the DL and he was available out of the bullpen. Manager Ron Gardenhire said he'd like to get Liriano an outing or two out of the bullpen and he could start one game of the doubleheader at Cleveland on Sept. 24 with a limited pitch count. ... The Indians will send RHP Jeanmar Gomez (3-2, 3.95) to the mound Saturday. Gomez is 3-0 with a 1.56 ERA in his last three starts. ... Minnesota counters with RHP Anthony Swarzak (3-6, 3.89). Swarzak has lost his last three decisions but has allowed just four earned runs over 14 innings in two September starts.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  Away from the madness of a cigar party for a moment, Jim Leyland nearly cried.	For everybody who figured there was no way he would manage the Tigers beyond this season, for all those who couldn't envision a comeback after Detroit fell behind by eight games in early May, Leyland sat in his office puffing on his own celebratory stogie, a black "2011 MLB Playoffs" hat on his head.	Detroit is AL Central champion.	Newcomer Doug Fister pitched the Tigers to the division title on Friday night, beating the Oakland Athletics 3-1 to secure a first-place finish for Detroit for the first time in nearly a quarter-century.	Fister (9-13) retired 17 straight during one stretch to win his third straight start and fifth consecutive decision, and Wilson Betemit hit a go-ahead triple off Trevor Cahill (11-14) in the sixth. Don Kelly had a solo homer in the seventh after an earlier RBI single.	"We were seven games behind the Cleveland Indians at one point and people weren't really talking about us at all," Leyland said. "They deserved it. They worked hard. They stuck together. There are special moments you can't put a price tag on and you just enjoy them. I'm an emotional guy, we all know that."	Detroit is headed to the playoffs for the first time since winning the AL wild card in 2006 and losing to St. Louis in the World Series. The Tigers (88-63) had not finished on top since winning the AL East in 1987, three years after their last World Series championship.	"It's been pretty much magical this whole second half," reliever Phil Coke said. "We've gone out every day and handled our business. We're all hungry. We're all ready for this."	When Josh Willingham grounded out to third to end it, the victorious Tigers sprinted out of their dugout. Closer Jose Valverde pumped both arms, then turned as catcher Alex Avila jumped into his embrace.	Leyland stood some 10 feet from the pitcher's mound and waited for a hug from each of his players.	New faces and old, Detroit made all the right moves. This month alone there have been two sweeps of the White Sox, one of Minnesota and another at Cleveland.	"I have a very special satisfaction. A lot of people probably didn't think I'd be managing the Tigers next year," Leyland said. "We were fortunate, because we were the team this year that met the challenge. We were almost spotless."	In the last year, general manager Dave Dombrowski acquired three players from within the division to put his team in position for a sensational September.	Delmon Young came to Detroit in a three-player deal with the Twins on Aug. 15, veteran infielder Betemit from Kansas City for a pair of prospects in July and Jhonny Peralta at the trade deadline last year from Cleveland.	Then there's the reliable Fister, who improved to 6-1 since he joined the Tigers in a six-player trade with Seattle on July 30. He is 5-0 over his last six starts and has given Leyland another front-line starter behind AL Cy Young Award contender Justin Verlander.	Fister has allowed only four earned runs in his last 44 2/3 innings for an 0.81 ERA over that stretch. He was unfazed after giving up Willingham's career-best 27th homer leading off the second. David DeJesus followed with a single, and Fister retired the next 17 hitters in order before another single by DeJesus, who played in his 1,000th game.	Fister allowed three hits, struck out five and didn't walk a batter for the fifth time in nine starts for Detroit.	Valverde finished for his 44th save in as many chances this season and his franchise-record 47th in a row overall.	As the party turned the visiting clubhouse floor into a slip-and-slide of water and ice, Fister stood to the side and watched. What a difference being with Detroit.	The Tigers won for the 23rd time in 28 games dating to Aug. 19 and 25th time in the club's last 36 road games.	"This is very special to me," he said. "This is some fun stuff."	"I just want to party!" yelled pitcher Al Alburquerque as he walked into the plumes of smoke coming from all corners.	Same for Leyland.	The 66-year-old could light up a fresh cigar to celebrate a division title that looked like a longshot mere months ago. The sixth-year skipper sported fresh socks and undershorts a day after Detroit's winning streak was stopped at 12 games in a 6-1 loss in Thursday night's series opener.	He'll surely be changing clothes again after a bubbly celebration in the visiting clubhouse at the Coliseum.	These Tigers have been on such a roll there has been no need for scoreboard watching -- even if Leyland has been doing so since April. It's been quite a late-season surge, considering Detroit trailed the Indians by eight games and was four games under .500 on May 3.	On Friday, the offense eventually did enough to back Fister.	"We're just a very talented and resilient team," Avila said. "At that (early) point in the season, we knew we just had to keep playing our game and we'd get there."	Detroit missed chances in the fourth and fifth innings after the game was delayed for 16 minutes before the top of the fourth because of an outage to the stadium lights in the Coliseum.	This is the second straight year a visiting team has clinched the division in Oakland. Reigning AL champion Texas did it last season and visits next week.	"It's not something you want to do," manager Bob Melvin said. "We would have liked to have won that game in the ninth inning. If you can have them win it in a different fashion, whether it's going in the clubhouse after we beat them and somebody else losing, that's how you'd like to do it."	Game notes	 Willingham hit 26 homers in 2006 with Florida. ... Cabrera reached base four times, with a singles and three walks. ... A's 2B Jemile Weeks returned to the lineup after missing two games with leg cramps. He batted in the No. 2 hole for the first time in his career. "I don't want him to feel he has to push it right away," manager Bob Melvin said. ... LHP Gio Gonzalez starts Saturday looking to improve to 5-1 over a six-start stretch. ... A wedding took place in front of home plate less than an hour before first pitch. ... It was also "Star Wars" night. ... A man on a treadmill in left field failed to run a marathon before the game ended.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN DIEGO --  Tim Stauffer's luck changed at the right time.	Stauffer shut down Arizona into the seventh inning before leaving with arm stiffness and the last-place San Diego Padres beat the NL West-leading Diamondbacks 2-0 on Friday night.	The Diamondbacks' lead over the defending World Series champion San Francisco Giants was trimmed to six games with 11 to play. The Giants won 9-1 at Colorado. It was just the fourth time the Diamondbacks have been shut out this season, a major league low.	"We really don't want them to celebrate on our field," said closer Heath Bell, who pitched a perfect ninth for his 38th save in 43 chances.	Arizona had won 18 of 22 since Aug. 23, and had beaten the Padres nine times in their previous 11 meetings. San Diego had lost 17 of 20 coming in. Each team had just five hits at spacious Petco Park.	Stauffer (9-12) won for the first time in five starts by holding Arizona to four hits in 6 2/3 innings. He struck out six and walked none.	Manager Bud Black and a trainer came out to check on Stauffer after he got Aaron Hill to fly out to center. The right-hander then came out of the game.	"It was nothing that prevented me from pitching," Stauffer said. "I felt it early on. I put a little extra stress on my arm because for some reason it was coming out a little better. I was able to let it go."	Stauffer was coming off a no-decision in the Padres' 6-5 loss in 10 innings at Arizona last Saturday, when Bell allowed two homers in the ninth and Joe Thatcher walked in the winning run in the 10th.	He was strong from the start in this one, striking out five in the first two innings.	Stauffer and three relievers combined for a five-hitter for San Diego's seventh shutout this year. By comparison, the Padres tied the franchise record with 20 shutouts in 2010.	"You could tell his ball had a lot of life," manager Bud Black said. "His fastball had good movement, good life on his slider and good arm action on the changeup."	The Padres gave Stauffer all the support he needed by scoring two runs on three straight hits off rookie lefty Wade Miley (3-2) with one out in the first. Jason Bartlett singled, advanced on a wild pitch and scored on Jesus Guzman's single to left-center. Nick Hundley doubled to move Guzman to third, and he scored after Gerardo Parra booted the ball in the left-field corner.	Miley (3-2) allowed two runs and five hits in six innings.	Game notes	 Black said 3B James Darnell is likely out for the rest of the season after suffering a subluxation of his left shoulder after making a diving stop of Justin Upton's single leading off the seventh. ... San Diego 3B Chase Headley, on the disabled list since early August with a broken finger, is going to instructional camp in Arizona to get some at-bats. ... RHP Josh Collmenter (9-9, 3.40 ERA), who took a 7-6 loss to the Padres on Sunday, starts Saturday night's game against San Diego LHP Wade LeBlanc (3-5, 5.43 ERA). LeBlanc was the winner on Sunday. He's allowed four earned runs in each of his last four starts after allowing three or fewer runs in his first seven starts with the Padres this year.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SEATTLE --  Blake Beavan got a few texts from old friends on Friday afternoon asking him to take it easy on the Texas Rangers.	Instead of taking it easy, the former Rangers prospect dominated his former club in his finest major league performance to date.	Beavan threw eight shutout innings, giving up just four hits, and the Seattle Mariners took advantage of one big error from Texas second baseman Ian Kinsler in a 4-0 win over the Rangers on Friday night.	"I wanted to go out there and shut them down and that's what I tried to do," Beavan said. "I had a different attitude out there, but calm."	Trusting a new curveball more, Beavan kept the Rangers guessing. Beavan hasn't used the strikeout much since coming up from Triple-A Tacoma at the beginning of July, but he liberally used his defense. Beavan got 11 fly-ball outs in taking advantage of Seattle's vast outfield and a cool night.	The curveball, mixed with a well-placed fastball, finally slowed down Texas' offense. The Rangers had scored at least seven runs in their past six games, but Texas didn't get its first hit until the third inning and only once got a runner into scoring position.	Beavan (5-5) allowed four hits and struck out three. Even more important, he didn't walk a batter.	"It's a new pitch for me and it's getting better every start and every bullpen and tonight I think just showed me that working hard on it and throwing it more is only going to get it better," Beavan said.	The only time Texas threatened came in the sixth with consecutive singles by Endy Chavez and Kinsler. After failing to get a sacrifice bunt laid down, Elvis Andrus then hit into a 6-4-3 double play nicely turned by Brendan Ryan and Dustin Ackley. Beavan jammed Josh Hamilton into popping up to end the inning.	Beavan was only at 95 pitches entering the ninth and wanted a chance at his first complete game. With the top of the Rangers order coming up in the ninth and the lead only at four, Seattle manager Eric Wedge decided to go with Brandon League.	The move looked genius after League, in a non-save situation, struck out Kinsler, Andrus and Hamilton to end the game. The victory ensured that Seattle would avoid 100 losses for just the second time in the past four seasons.	"Coming around the top of the lineup again, I felt like that was enough. If we had tacked on there in the eighth inning I probably would have sent him back out," Wedge said.	Kinsler's error was his 11th of the season and came with two outs in the third. He charged a slow chopper from Ackley, who raced up the first-base line, and he had time to make the throw but it sailed wide of Mitch Moreland and allowed Wells to score from second.	It was the beginning of an odd sequence.	The next batter, Miguel Olivo, then saw Texas starter C.J. Wilson dump a curveball at his feet and it bounced past catcher Yorvit Torrealba, allowing Ryan to score. Olivo later singled to keep the inning going.	Then it was Mike Carp's turn for some wackiness. Wilson got Carp to hit a grounder back up the middle and shortstop Andrus was in perfect position to make the play. The ball never got to him as it hit second base and caromed the opposite way Andrus was moving.	"It was like the Titanic. Not to make light of tragic situations but it got to the point there wasn't anything anybody could do," Wilson said. "It seemed like everything we tried, whether it was getting grounders or what, it went the wrong way."	Wells later hit his 11th homer of the season leading off the seventh inning that led to the end of Wilson's night. It was Wells' first homer since Aug. 21.	Wilson (16-7) went 6 1/3 innings and gave up just one earned run while striking out eight. But the Rangers were unable to gain a game on the Angels in the AL West.	Game notes	 Texas OF Nelson Cruz expected to return to the Rangers lineup as the DH on Saturday. Cruz has been recovering from a left hamstring strain. ... Seattle unveiled the first statue in franchise history on Friday, honoring late broadcaster Dave Niehaus. The statue sits on the concourse in right-center field and honors Niehaus' 34 years as the Mariners' lead announcer. Niehaus died of a heart attack last November. ... Young LHP Anthony Vasquez makes his fifth start for Seattle on Saturday. The 24-year-old took a loss in his last start despite giving up just two runs in six innings. ... Texas RHP Colby Lewis starts Saturday for the first time since Sept. 9. He was given few extra days of rest after his last start -- a win over Oakland.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

LOS ANGELES --  Bothered by a stiff neck in his last few starts, Hiroki Kuroda could have skipped his turn in the rotation and rested. Instead, he went ahead, somewhat reassured by results of an MRI that showed no new damage.	Kuroda set a career high with his 12th victory, helped by pinch hitter James Loney's three-run homer and Matt Kemp's 111th RBI in the Los Angeles Dodgers' 7-2 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Friday night.	"It was a little peace of mind, but I still think it bothered me," Kuroda said through a translator. "Little things bother me. I didn't change any of my mechanics."	He said he plans to make his next scheduled start.	Kuroda (12-16) allowed two runs and five hits in six innings. The right-hander struck out seven and walked two to win for the first time in three starts this month. He is now 5-1 against the Pirates in his career.	"(Rod) Barajas called a great game," Kuroda said. "He knew all the batters. He wanted me to pitch inside and every time I was doubting pitches he called the right ones."	Loney's first career pinch-hit homer off Chris Resop hit the top of the right-field wall, capping a four-run sixth inning that extended the Dodgers' lead to 7-2. Dee Gordon grounded into a fielder's choice to first base, scoring Russ Mitchell for the other run.	"Those extra runs made it a lot easier on us," Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said.	Kuroda gave up three consecutive hits to open the sixth, including Alex Presley's leadoff homer, before retiring the next three batters to end the inning.	"Hiro was good," Mattingly said. "He was sharper than his last two outings, like he had a little zip back. It felt like he was throwing the ball where he wanted. The MRI helped him because it let him know there was no damage and gave him the freedom as a player to go out there and let it go."	Pittsburgh's Jeff Locke (0-2) gave up three runs and five hits in three innings, walked two and struck out none in his second major league start after being recalled from Triple-A on Sept. 6.	Locke, who lives in New Hampshire, said it was his first time being out of the Eastern time zone.	"It was very exciting," he said. "It's definitely an honor to come here and pitch in one of the legendary stadiums of all time. I had this adrenaline going. But I wasn't nervous at all. I just left a lot of pitches up and got into a lot of deep counts."	Pittsburgh is 17-39 since July 20, when it was 51-44 and led the NL Central by a half-game.	The Dodgers took a 3-1 lead in the third on Kemp's single that increased his career-high RBIs total and Juan Rivera's fielder's choice groundout. Barajas tied the game at 1 in the second when his RBI double hit the left-field line.	The Pirates' other run came in the first when Garrett Jones scored on shortstop Gordon's throwing error that sailed past first base.	Game notes	 Kemp had his 51st multi-hit game, the most by a Dodger since Juan Pierre's 59 in 2007. ... Mattingly said he heard from GM Ned Colletti that LHP Clayton Kershaw won't be suspended by MLB after hitting Arizona's Gerardo Parra with a pitch and getting ejected Wednesday. ... Dodgers RHP Jonathan Broxton will have arthroscopic surgery Monday to reduce a spur on his right elbow and remove loose chips. He hasn't pitched since May while bothered by his elbow and a sore back. ... Pirates C Ryan Doumit had two singles to improve to 18-for-49 in 14 career games at Chavez Ravine.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CHICAGO -- For its first 49 seasons in the majors, Houston could claim it had never lost 100 games in a year.	No more.	In a microcosm of the Astros' season, they squandered a bases-loaded chance in the ninth inning and fell to Rodrigo Lopez and the Chicago Cubs 2-1 Saturday for their 100th loss.	"We were (0 for 14) with runners in scoring position, which turned out to be quite a number," Astros manager Brad Mills said. "At least we're putting ourselves in that position."	The Astros, who began play in 1962 as the Colt .45s, dropped to 51-100. Colorado and the Angels are the only remaining franchises that have never lost 100 games in a season.	"It's definitely a number that breaking camp with the talent we've had all year in this clubhouse, (I didn't think) anything like that would happen," shortstop Clint Barmes said.	The Cubs, meanwhile, won for the 4,000th time since moving into Wrigley Field in 1915. Only the Yankees at the original Yankee Stadium and Red Sox at Fenway Park have won more games in one ballpark than the Cubs have taken at their ivy-covered home.	Lopez (6-6) didn't allow an earned run and held the Astros to four hits in six innings while striking out seven, a performance he's hoping will help translate to a big league spot next year.	"It's very important," Lopez said. "I'm trying to do a job this year and trying to find a spot somewhere. Free agency, they just look at your numbers. It's important for me to go home and make a case for getting a job next year."	Sean Marshall held on in the ninth for his fifth save.	Barmes' one-out double off the lefty put runners on second and third, then Marshall intentionally walked J.D. Martinez to load the bases. But Jose Altuve struck out and pinch-hitter Humberto Quintero grounded out to end the game.	Bryan LaHair hit a solo homer and reached base three times for the Cubs.	LaHair, who led the minor leagues with 38 homers, continued his eye-opening September audition with a drive to dead center field on the first pitch by Henry Sosa (2-5) in the fourth.	"When he squares it up it's pretty impressive," Cubs manager Mike Quade said. "Big, strong kid. We like what we've seen so far, that's for sure."	LaHair also walked twice and is hitting .433 in 30 at-bats since his promotion.	"I'm trying to get good pitches to hit and hit them hard like I've been doing all year," LaHair said. "That's my whole approach, just getting good pitches to hit and hitting them hard."	Sosa recovered from first-inning control problems to throw six innings, holding Chicago to four hits and two runs with five walks and five strikeouts.	Sosa hadn't walked more than three batters in any of his 36 appearances, including 17 starts, between the majors and minors this season. He walked four in the first inning, leading to the Cubs' first run.	"I don't really know what happened to me in the first inning," Sosa said. "Just kind of like all over the place."	The first free pass was issued to speedy Tony Campana, who moved to second on a groundout, stole third and scored when the throw by catcher Carlos Corporan sailed into left field.	Campana also reached on an infield single in the seventh. Despite playing on a part-time basis, Campana leads the Cubs with 22 steals and has been caught only once. His 95.7 percent success rate is the best in the majors.	Lopez matched his season high with five strikeouts in just three innings. He reached his season high in the fourth and finished his most whiffs since July 22, 2010.	The Astros threatened in the eighth, but Kerry Wood struck out J.B. Shuck looking with runners on the corners to end the inning. It was another frustrating moment in a long season with which the Astros say they've already come to grips.	"We can't focus on (100 losses) right now," Mills said. "It's not the right thing that we need to be looking at as we move forward."	Game notes	 The last six games played between the Cubs and Astros have been decided by one run. ... Starlin Castro doubled to lead off the fifth. He's reached base in 30 straight games, the most by a Cubs shortstop since Ernie Banks in 1960. ... Quade gave CF Marlon Byrd the day off. As he continues to mix and match between the veterans and young players on his expanded September roster, Quade said 3B Aramis Ramirez would likely get Sunday's game off. ... Altuve did not start and later entered as a pinch-runner. Altuve was hitting .125 over his last 11 games and has drawn just four walks in 200 plate appearances since coming the big leagues. ... Ryan Dempster will make his 32nd start of the season for the Cubs in Sunday's series finale and will attempt break a personal four-game losing streak. He'll face Houston's Brett Myers, who has a 1.19 ERA in 22 2/3 innings over his last three starts.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

TORONTO -- To Mariano Rivera, it was just another save. To Yankees manager Joe Girardi, there's no such thing.	Rivera tied the major league saves record, earning the 601st of his career and matching Trevor Hoffman while preserving the New York Yankees' 7-6 win over the Toronto Blue Jays on Saturday.	"To me it was normal," Rivera said.	With his team still trying to clinch the AL East, Girardi wasn't hearing any of that.	"Right now, they're all big for us," he said.	The 41-year-old Rivera was perfect in pitching the ninth inning for his 42nd save of the season, leaving him on the brink of sole ownership of the mark.	"602 is the big one because it just puts the final stamp on it that he's the greatest closer of all time," Girardi said.	If Rivera doesn't get the record Sunday, he'll likely reach it sometime during an eight-game homestand that begins Monday.	"I would love to get it at home, but I don't think like that," Rivera said.	Rivera struck out Colby Rasmus looking to start the ninth, then retired Brett Lawrie on a broken-bat grounder to first. While some in the crowd of 39,288 headed for the exits, most stayed to watch as Rivera got Eric Thames on a routine fly to center.	Even before the ball had been caught, Rivera walked off the mound with his head lowered to shake hands with catcher Russell Martin. Rivera broke into a smile during the postgame congratulations line and embraced teammate Alex Rodriguez.	Center fielder Curtis Granderson flipped Rivera the souvenir ball.	Rivera, whose wife and two youngest sons joined him in Toronto for the weekend, told the media hordes gathered around his locker that he doesn't enjoy the spotlight of his record pursuit.	"I am uncomfortable because I don't have this much attention at all," he said, smiling. "I would like you guys to just leave it alone. That would be good."	Rivera, now in his 17th season in the big leagues, recorded his 600th save at Seattle on Tuesday. He also has 42 saves in postseason play.	"Mo is awesome," Rodriguez said. "You just run out of things to say about him. Every save he's had in his career meant something, and tonight was another example of that."	Blue Jays manager John Farrell called Rivera "the standard by which all are compared."	"If you're a fan of baseball and the game, you appreciate how good he is, how consistent he is," Farrell said.	The tying save came in Rivera's 60th appearance of the year, surpassing former Yankees teammate Mike Stanton with a record 14 seasons of 60 games.	Granderson hit his 40th homer, a go-ahead shot in the seventh to cap a 12 pitch at-bat. He fouled off seven straight pitches before homering.	Rodriguez hit his 16th home run as New York ended a two-game skid. The Yankees trailed 6-1 before beginning their comeback with four runs in the sixth.	Aaron Laffey (3-2) pitched one inning for the win. Scott Proctor, Laffey, Hector Noesi and Rafael Soriano each worked a scoreless inning before Rivera closed it out.	Bartolo Colon, who has not won in eight starts, allowed six runs and seven hits in four innings for New York.	"It wasn't great," Girardi said. "Six runs in four innings is not what we expect from Bartolo. We'll see if we can get him back on track his next start."	The Yankees closed to 6-5 in the sixth. Granderson led off with a double and scored when Rasmus bobbled Mark Teixeira's single to center. Robinson Cano was hit by a pitch and Rodriguez followed with his first home run since Sept. 4.	"I came up in the same situation a couple of innings before and didn't come through so I was glad to get another opportunity," Rodriguez said. "I got a good pitch to hit and capitalized."	Derek Jeter opened the Yankees seventh with an infield single and Granderson homered against Carlos Villanueva (6-4).	The Blue Jays scored four times in the second against Colon. Rasmus and Jose Molina each hit RBI doubles, Lawrie drove in a run with a groundout and Mike McCoy capped it with a squeeze bunt.	The Yankees answered with a run in the fourth, an inning marked by Cano's baserunning blunder. After hitting an RBI double, Teixeira moved to third when left fielder Adam Loewen dropped Cano's fly ball to left. One out later, Nick Swisher hit a liner into right center but Rasmus made a fine running catch for the second out. Thinking the ball would drop, Cano rounded third and passed Teixeira, who was heading back to tag up. Cano was ruled out, and the Blue Jays got credit for a double play.	"I think Robby thought the ball was going to drop for sure," Girardi said. "When Swish hit it, I thought it was going to fall, too. Still, you've got to make sure."	Toronto added to its lead and chased Colon with two runs in the bottom half, with McCoy hitting a two-out double to right.	Game notes	 Rivera has blown five saves this season. ... Rodriguez batted fifth for the first time this season. He scored the 1,821st run of his career, tying Eddie Collins for 14th place on the all time list. ... The Yankees are an ML-best 40-11 in day games. ... Yankees RHP Phil Hughes (back spasms) has been scratched from Monday's start against Minnesota and will be replaced by RHP A.J. Burnett. Hughes, who felt sore after Friday's bullpen session, is expected to pitch Tuesday or Wednesday. ... New York OF Greg Golson celebrated his 26th birthday. ... Loewen made his first start in left field after previous appearances in right and center. ... New York RHP Freddy Garcia (11-7) faces Toronto RHP Brandon Morrow (9-11) in Sunday's series finale.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  Athletics' left-hander Gio Gonzalez threw only nine first-pitch strikes, struggled with his control and worked with runners on base in almost every inning.	Earning his 14th win of the season sure didn't come easily for Gonzalez. Then again, not much has this season. Not for A's or their All-Star left-hander.	"Maybe he didn't have his best stuff and he got behind hitters but he made pitches when he had to," manager Bob Melvin said following Oakland's 5-3 win over the Detroit Tigers on Saturday. "I'm surprised he got us through seven, but that's what good pitchers do. They make it work even without their best stuff."	Gonzalez allowed eight hits over seven innings, struck out four and walked two while improving to 5-1 over his past six starts.	He got plenty of help from Oakland's defense error-prone defense, which turned three double plays while holding Detroit scoreless for the first five innings.	"The defense played unbelievable," Gonzalez said. "I felt like I was around the zone. They were swinging the bats, being aggressive so we tried to take advantage of that."	Coco Crisp drove in the deciding run with an RBI single over the head of shortstop Jhonny Peralta in the second inning while Josh Willingham singled twice and scored for Oakland.	The A's won for only the second time in five games, both coming in this series with the Tigers.	Detroit still had the tying run at the plate in the ninth following Don Kelly's pinch-hit two-run double off Bailey.	Oakland's two-time All-Star closer, who missed 53 games earlier this year with a strained forearm, got out of it by striking out pinch hitter Alex Avila and Austin Jackson.	No one could blame the Tigers for being a little off after toasting their first division title in nearly a quarter-century with a champagne-and-cigar celebration in the tiny visitor's clubhouse at the Oakland Coliseum.	Magglio Ordonez had three hits and scored a run for Detroit, who had men on base most of the afternoon but failed to capitalize.	Gonzalez limited the damage to beat Detroit for the first time in five career starts. He did it despite twisting his ankle trying to make a pickoff throw to second base in the first inning.	After Ordonez and Ryan Raburn hit back-to-back one-out singles, Gonzalez (14-12) tried to catch Ordonez straying off second base. He turned to throw, but slipped on the mound and appeared to roll his left ankle.	Gonzalez walked around behind the mound to test his foot, threw one warmup pitch then returned to the mound. He got out of the inning when Miguel Cabrera flew out to right fielder David De Jesus, who doubled up Ordonez at second.	Detroit was stymied by Gonzalez in the third and fourth and only managed one run after loading the bases with one out in the sixth. Peralta hit a sacrifice fly to score Ordonez, but that was all the Tigers could get off Gonzalez.	"It was a good win, a good step in the right direction for us," Gonzalez said. "We did our job."	Grant Balfour pitched a scoreless eighth inning and Andrew Bailey worked the ninth for Oakland.	The Tigers had plenty of opportunities -- they had at least two runners on base in five innings -- but stranded seven runners and lost for only the third time this month.	Right-hander Rick Porcello took the loss, allowing three runs over seven innings. Porcello (14-9) struck out four and walked three but was denied in his first attempt to become the second-youngest player in franchise history to reach 39 career wins before his 23rd birthday.	Raburn went 2 for 4 while Victor Martinez singled twice to raise his batting average this month to .349.	The A's stranded a pair of runners in the first then took a 2-0 lead in the second on RBI singles by Scott Sizemore and Crisp.	Oakland loaded the bases against Porcello with no outs the following inning, but Detroit's right-hander allowed only a sacrifice fly to Kurt Suzuki then got Sizemore to ground out to end the inning.	Jemile Weeks singled in Suzuki in the eighth to make it 4-1 and Crisp followed with his second RBI single.	Weeks finished 3 for 5 while Crisp and Sizemore added two hits apiece.	Game notes	 OF Ryan Sweeney, sidelined by a sore quad, rode a stationary bicycle before the game to test his leg. ... Injured Oakland left-hander Dallas Braden, out since undergoing season-ending surgery on his pitching shoulder, was in the team's clubhouse before the game and will accompany Oakland on its final road trip beginning Friday in Anaheim. ... The A's recalled RHP Graham Godfrey and 1B Chris Carter from Triple-A Sacramento before the game. ... Justin Verlander goes for his major league-leading 24th win in the series finale Sunday. Verlander (23-5) has only two wins in seven career starts in Oakland. ... RHP Guillermo Moscoso (8-8) is on a two-game winning streak, the longest of his career, and will go for Oakland in the finale.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

BOSTON -- Three games out. Eleven left to play. And the Tampa Bay Rays mean it when they say the next one is the most important of all.	"We are definitely playing playoff baseball right now and we're not even in the playoffs yet," manager Joe Maddon said Saturday after the Rays beat Boston 4-3 to trim the Red Sox lead in the AL wild-card race to three games.	"I love the fact that we do have a bunch of tough guys. ... When you're playing this time of year for all the marbles, you can't be intimidated by the opponent or the venue," he said.	Ben Zobrist hit a two-run homer off Jon Lester, and Jeff Niemann (11-7) pitched five solid innings to give Tampa Bay its seventh win in its last eight games against Boston, including two of three so far in this weekend's four-game series. The Red Sox have lost 10 of their last 13 games since Sept. 3, when they led the wild-card race by nine games.	Tim Wakefield faces Tampa Bay's David Price in the series finale on Sunday.	"Of course the sweep was a great thought, and we lost that possibility (Friday)," Maddon said. "But three out of four ain't bad, either. I think that Mr. Meat Loaf intended the song to say that."	With a victory over Boston on Sunday, the Rays would trail by two heading into the final 10 games. But they have seven of their last 11 against the first-place New York Yankees, and Boston has seven of its remaining games against the last-place Baltimore Orioles.	"This isn't our first go-round at this," Lester said. "We've got plenty of guys in that clubhouse that have been through it. It's easier when you're coming from behind than where we're at. There's no pressure. Obviously they're doing a good job. We've just got to grind it out. That's the attitude in that clubhouse. We've got to stay working and grind. We can't worry about what's being said about us or what's going on."	Matt Moore pitched three innings of relief, and Joel Peralta pitched the ninth for his fourth save.	"We've got to come back and try to get another one," Peralta said. "I know we've got a tough road. I know we're chasing, and we're chasing a great team. But we're playing great this month."	Lester (15-8) went just four innings against Tampa Bay last Sunday, giving up four runs but throwing 111 pitches to lose for the first time in six starts. He was better this time, allowing four runs on five hits and four walks and striking out five in seven innings.	But the result was the same.	For the second straight night, the Rays got to Boston's starter in the first. Desmond Jennings walked to lead off the game and scored on Zobrist's homer off the top of the Green Monster. Tampa added another run in the third when Jennings doubled and, after moving up on a groundout, scored on a wild pitch.	The Red Sox made it 3-2 in the bottom half when Mike Aviles hit an RBI double and scored on a sacrifice fly, but Evan Longoria's run-scoring single in the fifth made it 4-2.	Carl Crawford singled to lead off the seventh against Moore and scored on Jacoby Ellsbury's groundout to cut the deficit to 4-3, but Moore fanned Dustin Pedroia with Ellsbury on third to end the inning.	David Ortiz hit a long fly ball off Moore in the eighth, but B.J. Upton caught it at the warning track in front of the Boston bullpen.	Aviles had three hits, including a single up the middle with two out in the ninth. But Peralta got Marco Scutaro on a grounder to third to end the game.	Boston is batting just .123 against Niemann, who gave up four hits in five innings, walking two and striking out six.	Game notes	 Red Sox RHP Clay Buchholz, who hasn't pitched since June 16 because of a back injury, threw 30 pitches off a mound and said he would still like to return this year if Boston makes the playoffs. ... RHP Bobby Jenks said his pulmonary embolism is being treated with medication and he expects to be ready for the start of spring training. ... Boston INF Kevin Youkilis missed his second straight game with a sports hernia. ... Longoria has 12 RBIs in five games. .... Zobrist has 10 RBIs in 10 games after getting 1 in his previous 12. ... Wakefield (7-6) is coming off his 200th career victory. He has 186 wins with the Red Sox, second to Roger Clemens and Cy Young, who are tied with 192.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ATLANTA -- Tim Hudson found the difference he needed by slightly adjusting his delivery.	By nudging his heel closer to the rubber, the Atlanta ace found the edge he was missing in three of his previous four starts.	"It was like night and day," he said after pitching the Braves past the New York Mets 1-0 Saturday. "It was good to figure it out now. I felt like something was very out of whack on my delivery."	Hudson struck out 10 and Chipper Jones hit an RBI single in the eighth inning as the Braves held their NL wild-card edge.	The Braves moved 4½ games ahead of St. Louis for the wild card. The Cardinals lost to Philadelphia 9-2, which clinched the NL East for the Phillies.	Hudson (15-10) held the Mets to four hits over eight innings, an improvment over his loss at St. Louis in his previous outing.	"Losing wasn't an option today," Hudson said. "We didn't get much, but we got enough. We've let some people down as a staff the last couple weeks. It was a game we needed to win."	Craig Kimbrel earned his 45th save in 51 chances after striking out the side, fanning David Wright, Lucas Duda and Jason Bay.	One day after the Mets beat Atlanta 12-2 and got 20 hits, Hudson and Kimbrel shut them down. The Braves have won three of four and the Mets have lost seven of eight.	Jones, whose career has been full of key hits against the Mets, did it again. He doubled in the seventh and was stranded, but delivered in the eighth.	R.A. Dickey (8-13) issued a leadoff walk to Jason Heyward, who moved up on Jose Constanza's sacrifice bunt and Michael Bourn's groundout. Martin Prado walked before Mets pitching coach Dan Warthen made a mound visit to discuss how Dickey would pitch to Jones.	Jones faced five pitches, all knuckeballs, before he singled over second base. In 810 career at-bats against the Mets, he has a .317 average, 48 homers and 153 RBIs.	"I never really think about successes or failures when I'm up there," Jones said. "I just think about the chess match between pitcher and hitter. It's pretty simple with him you know what you're going to get. You've just got to see it up and center it. Centering it is the hard part."	Hudson struck out at least 10 for the 12th time in his career. Dickey struck out four in 7 2/3 innings and also walked a season-high six.	Dickey held the Braves to three runners through the first five innings -- Prado's broken-bat single in the first and walks to Brian McCann in the second and Freddie Freeman in the fifth.	"I had a chance with Prado (in the eighth) and I had a knuckleball that just didn't bite," Dickey said. "It stayed up. I threw a good one to Chipper, and he did what a Hall of Famer does, you know? He hit a ground ball up the middle, and that was a good knuckleball."	Hudson escaped trouble in the third with runners on first and second when Dickey struck out on a sacrifice bunt attempt and Jose Reyes grounded into a double play.	"He was great today," Reyes said. "You have to give some credit to him. He was making some pitches, you know? His curveball, his sinker, everything was working today."	In the New York sixth, Ruben Tejada led off with a single and advanced to second on Hudson's wild pitch strikeout of Dickey. Hudson walked Reyes on four pitches, but stranded the runners on Angel Pagan's flyout and Wright's grounder.	Duda led off with a single in the seventh and advanced to second on a groundout by Nick Evans. On the play, it appeared on television replays that shortstop Alex Gonzalez beat Duda to the bag before throwing out Evans, and Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez left the dugout to argue with second base umpire Marvin Hudson.	After walking Josh Thole, Hudson struck out Tejada for his eighth strikeout. Jones didn't want to see Hudson's effort get wasted.	"He was locating his off-speed pitches early in the count," Jones said. "He had a good sinker, good curve. He threw them when he was behind in the count for strikes.That was the key. Hopefully this kind of re-energizes the ball club."	Game notes	 Mets LF Bay made a diving catch to his right to rob Hudson of a potential leadoff double in the sixth. ... Fredi Gonzalez moved Prado to No. 2 in the batting order and put Jones in his usual third spot for the first time in his last eight games. ... New York dropped to 16-28 in Atlanta over the last five years. ... RHP Dillon Gee, New York's starter Sunday, lost 5-1 to Atlanta on Sept. 8, but is 2-2 with a 2.86 ERA in six career starts against the Braves. Gee is 1-0 with a 0.93 ERA in two starts at Turner Field. ... Rookie RHP Brandon Beachy will face New York for the first time in his career. Atlanta is 11-12 in his 2011 starts. Beachy is winless with a 4.24 ERA in his last three starts.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

BALTIMORE -- The Los Angeles Angels haven't reached panic mode -- yet.	Although their shaky playoff hopes absorbed another blow Saturday night with a 6-2 loss to the Baltimore Orioles, the Angels know they can't afford to succumb to self-imposed pressure.	"It's the elephant in the room," first baseman Mark Trumbo said. "I guess there's a couple ways you can approach it. I don't think it would be beneficial if there was panic, so this is going to be the way we go about it. Guys want to win, there's no doubt about it, but everyone here's professional enough to go about it without yelling and screaming."	Desperately needing a win to stay within striking distance of first-place Texas in the AL West and Boston in the wild-card chase, Los Angeles fell flat for the second night in a row against the last-place Orioles.	The Angels dropped 4 1/2 games behind Texas in the division race and remained five games in back of Boston in the wild-card hunt. Los Angeles has lost four of six and has only 11 games left.	"Every time you don't get it done, obviously it's making that climb a little bit tougher," manager Mike Scioscia said. "We're getting down to where you see the finish line and we know we've got to pick up some ground. But you got to focus on what it's going to take to win some games and bring that out on the field and we haven't done a very good job of that the last two nights."	Orioles rookie Zach Britton (10-10) allowed one run and three hits in seven innings, walked two and had a career-high seven strikeouts.	Pedro Strop worked the eighth and Jim Johnson gave up a two-out RBI triple to Vernon Wells in the ninth.	J.J. Hardy hit his career-high 27th homer and Mark Reynolds hit No. 34 off Ervin Santana (11-12) in the first inning for the Orioles.	With nothing else to play for, Baltimore has embraced the spoiler role.	"I think it more so just shows the type of people we are as a team," Britton said. "We could easily have just kind of thrown in the towel and we're not doing that. We know that these teams have something to play for and we are playing them hard."	Santana settled down after the first inning, but the damage was done. The right-hander gave up five runs and five hits over seven innings and lost his third consecutive start. He was 5-0 in his previous five road starts.	"I was all over the place," Santana said. "Then, after that, (I) refocused and throw strikes."	Santana was dangerously wild. He walked three and hit two batters with pitches, including Reynolds, who was plunked in the helmet with a fastball in the third inning. Reynolds insisted upon remaining in the game, but was removed in the top of the fifth.	Reynolds was taken to the hospital for a precautionary CT scan, manager Buck Showalter said.	Baltimore sent 10 batters to the plate in the first inning and scored twice before Santana got an out.	After Matt Angle drew a leadoff walk, Hardy drove a 3-2 pitch over the left-field wall. One out later, Vladimir Guerrero singled and Matt Wieters walked before Reynolds homered with two outs on an 0-2 pitch.	The Angels, meanwhile, didn't get their first hit until Mike Trout singled with one out in the fifth. Erick Aybar followed with a single and Bobby Wilson hit a sacrifice fly.	Trumbo led off the seventh with a single and advanced to third with two outs before Aybar grounded out.	Baltimore made it 6-1 in the eighth against Garrett Richards. Wieters walked on four pitches and scored when Trout bobbled Chris Davis' double to right.	Game notes	 The start of the game was delayed 14 minutes after home plate umpire Brian O'Nora was struck in the right ankle by a ricocheting warmup pitch from Britton. The fallen umpire was helped off by Orioles athletic trainers. X-rays were inconclusive. Second base umpire Alfonzo Marquez moved behind the plate and the game was played with three umps. ... An MRI performed Saturday on Orioles OF Adam Jones revealed a sprained right thumb. "I'm fine, basically. Just tough it out," said Jones, who missed his seventh straight start because of the injury. "I've never really had this before. It's new to me." ... Right-hander Jered Weaver will start Sunday for the Angels on three days rest, Scioscia said. .. Showalter said left-hander Brian Matusz would start one of the games in Monday's doubleheader at Boston.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

WASHINGTON --  Washington Nationals starter Stephen Strasburg had two outs and two strikes on Florida Marlins slugger Mike Stanton in the first inning Saturday night -- and he went right at him.	Strasburg fired a high 99-mph fastball past Stanton for the strikeout, showing he can still dominate hitters with his power.	But his manager was even happier to see Strasburg get through six innings with three strikeouts, his lowest total in 15 career starts.	"It's fun to watch," Washington manager Davey Johnson said of Strasburg's punch-out pitch.	"I know the fans love it. As a manager, I don't like to see it because he elevates and adds to it. I'd rather just move it inside and do about the same speed. But I'm sure he's got something else in mind."	Long after Strasburg left, Donnie Murphy's two-run home run in the 13th inning helped give the Marlins a 4-1 win over the Nationals.	John Buck led off the 13th with a single and Murphy hit a 1-1 pitch from Collin Balester (1-4) into the visitors' bullpen in left-center field for his first homer this year.	"Last year, it seemed like every time I came up in that situation, something good happened," Murphy said. "And this year, there's been a couple times where I haven't. But it's just nice to get that first one."	Stanton doubled in Omar Infante later in the inning to give the Marlins a three-run cushion. Clay Hensley (5-6) struck out the side in the 12th inning for the win, and Leo Nunez pitched the 13th for his 36th save.	The loss mattered less to the Nationals than seeing their star right-hander come back strong after a rough outing.	Strasburg allowed one run and four hits over six innings in his third start after Tommy John surgery and was much more efficient than his last start Sept. 11, when he threw 57 pitches in three innings. Against the Marlins, he needed just 61 pitches for an outing twice as long.	"You're going to have games like this, you're going to have games like the last one," Strasburg said. "Sometimes you're going to go out there and throw a lot of pitches, but it's all about how you bounce back, how you make adjustments and see if you can keep the team in the ballgame."	Strasburg's control has been even more impressive than his power after returning from the surgery. Strasburg has yet to walk a batter in 14 innings this year.	"I'm just trying to throw strikes. Walks are going to happen," Strasburg said. "No one can go out and throw the ball exactly where they want to every single time."	Before the game, Johnson said he'd likely let Strasburg throw around 70 pitches. However, when the seventh inning started, Johnson sent out reliever Henry Rodriguez rather than let Strasburg continue.	"He had a lot left," Johnson said. "He could have actually gone further, he could have gone another inning, but I figured six innings was plenty."	Florida starter Chris Volstad also left with a no-decision despite a strong performance. Volstad allowed one run and six hits in seven innings, walking two and striking out three. Volstad has gone nine starts without earning a win.	Volstad also got the biggest hit of the night off Strasburg, a leadoff double in the third. Volstad later scored on Infante's sacrifice fly.	"He wasn't really happy that the pitcher hit his fastball," Johnson said of Strasburg.	Wilson Ramos hit his 13th homer in the fifth inning for the Nationals, who have lost the first two games of the three-game series.	After Ramos' homer tied the game at 1, a combination of strong bullpens and missed opportunities kept the teams playing until the 13th inning.	Murphy entered the game in the 10th inning as part of a double-switch in which left fielder Logan Morrison left the game. Morrison injured his right knee after sliding into the wall while making a catch in foul territory to end the ninth. Marlins manager Jack McKeon said Morrison would not play Sunday.	Balester pitched the final three innings and didn't allow a hit until the 13th.	"Both teams are battling out there, both bullpens are pitching good, and the starters pitched well, and you kind of feed off each other," Balester said. "After a while, something's going to happen and it's too bad it happened to us."	Game notes	 Strasburg is scheduled to make his next start Friday against the Atlanta Braves. Johnson said it was possible Strasburg could also pitch in the Nationals' final game, Sept. 28 at Florida. ... Washington RHP Brad Peacock (1-0) will make his second major league start Wednesday. ... The Marlins are 7-1 this season and 26-8 all time at Nationals Park. ... Nationals RHP Chien-Ming Wang (2-3) will start Sunday against Marlins LHP Brad Hand (1-7).

PHILADELPHIA --  Hunter Pence clutched a bottle of champagne and jumped around like an excited child opening Christmas presents.	The Philadelphia Phillies won another division crown, and Pence is along for his first postseason ride.	Roy Oswalt threw seven dominant innings, Raul Ibanez hit a grand slam and the Phillies clinched their fifth straight NL East title with a 9-2 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals on Saturday night.	"These guys have welcomed me in and treated me like family," said Pence, the All-Star outfielder who joined Philadelphia in a trade from Houston on July 29. "It just goes to show what type of guys we have here."	In a season where nothing less than a World Series championship would be considered a success, there wasn't much of a party on the field. The Phillies had a been-there, done-that attitude toward winning the division last year, and this time was no different.	Players ran onto the diamond a bit faster than usual, but they simply exchanged handshakes, hugs and high-fives as if this was an ordinary game in April. They did at least put on shirts and hats proclaiming themselves division champs.	The fans didn't even scream all that loud, even when the Phillie Phanatic ran on the field with a big flag that said 2011.	Once they reached the clubhouse, however, the Phillies popped open the bubbly and celebrated their achievement.	"I'm excited for a guy like Hunter who has never been here before," Chase Utley said. "It's a long season and you never know what's going to happen."	With the four aces leading the way, the Phillies are seeking their third NL pennant in four years and second World Series title.	They've taken care of the first step. Now they'll use the 12 remaining games to get ready for the postseason. It's still uncertain who the Phillies will face in the best-of-five first round when the NL playoffs begin Oct. 1.	"This is the first step," slugger Ryan Howard told the crowd that remained after the game. "We're gonna try to go all the way and we'll need you guys."	The major league-leading Phillies (98-52) are four wins away from setting a single-season club record.	None of those accomplishments will matter if they don't finish the season with a championship parade on Broad Street.	"It's an extraordinary effort," team president David Montgomery said. "Clearly, it's a team that has its priorities in order."	Oswalt (8-9) allowed no runs and five hits, striking out seven. Brad Lidge got one out in the eighth after Michael Stutes ran into trouble, and Ryan Madson finished with a seven-run cushion.	St. Louis fell 4½ games behind Atlanta in the wild-card race. They had won eight of nine to narrow the gap from 8½ back on Sept. 6.	"We played with a lot of urgency," Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said.	Cardinals starter Jake Westbrook (12-9) allowed one earned run and five hits in 3 1/3 innings. He's given up two earned runs or less in 11 of his 16 road starts this season, but fell to 8-4 away from home.	Oswalt, Philadelphia's best pitcher down the stretch last year after coming over from Houston in a trade on July 29, left spring training as the No. 3 starter behind Roy Halladay and Cliff Lee. But he struggled after starting 3-0, and a back injury forced him to the disabled twice.	The three-time All-Star was vintage Oswalt against the Cardinals. His fastball reached 94 mph a few times, and he had a nasty curveball.	Oswalt struck out Skip Schumaker on a 76-mph curve to leave two runners on in the seventh. All of his Ks came on swings.	"I'm not really going to be satisfied until we win that last game," Oswalt said. "I've done enough personal stuff that it really doesn't matter. All I want now is to win that last game. That's all any of us really want."	Stutes nearly blew a 3-0 lead in the eighth after getting the first two outs. Four straight singles by Jon Jay, Albert Pujols, Lance Berkman and David Freese got the Cardinals within 3-2.	But Lidge came in and retired Allen Craig on a grounder to second on his first pitch to end the inning.	The Phillies then blew it open with six unearned runs in the eighth. Carlos Ruiz reached second when his grounder skipped past third baseman Daniel Descalso for an error. Ruiz went to third on Jimmy Rollins' one-out single and scored on Shane Victorino's single up the middle.	After Utley was hit by a pitch, Howard struck out.	Octavio Dotel entered and Pence hustled out an infield single to shortstop Rafael Furcal to drive in another run. Ibanez then hit his slam to right to put it away.	Pence gave the Phillies a 1-0 lead on an RBI double in the first. An error by Furcal helped the Phillies add a run in the fourth. Placido Polanco led off with a walk. Oswalt sacrificed with one out and Furcal dropped the throw to second. Rollins followed with a single to load the bases. Victorino walked to force in Polanco to make it 2-0.	That ended Westbrook's night.	Arthur Rhodes came in and retired Utley on a shallow fly and Howard on a grounder.	Victorino hit a solo homer off Kyle McClellan in the sixth. He's been slumping lately, batting just .163 (14 for 86) in his previous 21 games.	Oswalt likely will be the fourth starter in the postseason after Halladay, Lee and Cole Hamels. Rookie Vance Worley would go to the bullpen, despite an 11-2 record.	Game notes	 A crowd of 45,470 was the 211th straight sellout at Citizens Bank Park, including playoffs. ... This was the fastest the Phillies ever clinched a division title. The previous was Game No. 156 in 1976. ... The Phillies had all their regulars in the starting lineup for the first time since Aug. 6. ... Rollins was 4 for 5. He was 3 for 20 coming in. ... The Phillies have scored just 22 runs in the last nine games and no more than three in any of them. ... The Cardinals are 6-28 when scoring fewer than three runs. ... St. Louis used seven pitchers. ... Hamels (14-8) faces Chris Carpenter (9-9) when the teams meet Sunday night.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The surging Kansas City Royals are giving their fans a glimpse of a brighter future.	Mike Moustakas hit his third home run in four games and Jeff Francoeur hit a three-run homer and the Royals beat the Chicago White Sox 10-3 Saturday night for their seventh straight victory.	The winning streak is the Royals' longest since winning seven consecutive Sept. 13-18, 2008. The White Sox have lost seven in a row, matching their longest losing streak of the year.	"I think our fans can see the light at the end of the tunnel," Royals manager Ned Yost said.	Moustakas, Eric Hosmer and Salvador Perez, a trio of highly regarded rookies, combined to go 7 for 14 with two RBIs and scored five runs.	Everett Teaford (2-0), a rookie left-hander, has won both of his starts since moving into the rotation after 23 relief appearances.	Nate Adcock, yet another rookie, worked the final three innings for his first major league save.	"As far as the nucleus, it's encouraging for sure," Teaford said. "We have to do it next year. Seven wins in a row in September isn't going to put us in the World Series next year. Hopefully, it will be something we can build on for next year."	Moustakas, who is hitting .519 during a seven-game hitting streak, said "absolutely" this can carry over until next season.	"I can't wait for tomorrow," Moustakas said. "We can't look far ahead. Next year is next year and we're all excited about that. We've still got to come out here and win a game tomorrow."	Moustakas, who had three hits, homered in the fifth with Eric Hosmer, who had doubled aboard. Moustakas and Perez singled in the fourth and both scored on Alcides Esocbar's triple.	Francoeur hit his 19th home run in the eighth with Melky Cabrera and Hosmer on base.	Perez and Cabrera each contributed three singles to the Royals' 18-hit attack. Escobar doubled and tripled and drove in two runs.	"One through nine, we've got guys that can hit," Moustakas said. "That's what is awesome about this team. There's not a drop off. Everyone is clicking, right now."	Teaford held the White Sox to four hits and one run -- Alex Rios' homer to lead off the second -- while walking two and striking out four.	In beating Seattle and Chicago, Teaford has allowed one run and seven hits in 11 innings, while walking three and striking out nine.	"I was very impressed with the way Teaford pitched, his ability to pitch his way out of jams," Yost said.	Teaford pitched out of trouble in the third and fourth innings. He stranded runners at second and third in the third after a Moustakas two-base throwing error and a walk. Teaford retired Gordon Beckham on a fly to center to end the fourth with the bases full.	"They got a couple of guys on and I walked a couple of batters," Teaford said. "I was able to keep the ball down and minimize the damage. It ate up a little bit of my pitch count, but to come out with zeros in those innings was big."	White Sox rookie right-hander Zack Stewart (2-5), who was acquired in a July 27 trade with Toronto, allowed five runs and 11 hits in five innings. He has given up 18 hits and 11 runs in 10 innings in losing his past two starts.	"We're not pitching well," White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen said. "Our pitching staff has been pretty good all season, just not the last week and a half."	The White Sox scored two runs in the seventh off Adcock. Tyler Flowers scored on an Adcock wild pitch, while Brent Morel came home on a Juan Pierre ground out.	Game notes	 RHP Luis Mendoza will be promoted from Triple-A Omaha and start Tuesday for the Royals against Detroit. Mendoza went 12-5 with a Pacific Coast League-leading 2.18 ERA. He went 2-0 with a 1.29 ERA in two playoff starts. Omaha wrapped up the PCL championship Saturday with Lance Zawadski getting four hits and David Lough hitting a two-run HR in an 11-6 victory at Sacramento to sweep the series. ... Royals closer Joakim Soria remains sidelined with a strained right hamstring, which he injured Sunday. ... White Sox DH Adam Dunn is 4 for 87 against left-handed pitching after a fourth-inning single off Teaford. ... LHP John Danks, who is 0-3 with a 10.91 ERA in his past three starts, will start Sunday for the White Sox. ... LHP Bruce Chen, who struck out eight and held Minnesota to two hits in eight scoreless innings in winning his previous start, will be the Kansas City starter in the finale of this four-game series.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CINCINNATI --  Yovani Gallardo and the Milwaukee Brewers couldn't have picked a better time to catch their second wind.	After tying his single-game career high in strikeouts in his last start, Gallardo surpassed it with 13 and Ryan Braun hit his third home run in two nights to help the Milwaukee Brewers inch closer to a Central Division championship with a 10-1 win over the Cincinnati Reds on Saturday night.	"I had a little trouble with my fastball early in the game," Gallardo said. "It got better as the game went on. I felt like I had a good curveball. I could command the strike zone with it. I was able to throw it to both sides of the plate, and I was able to make the big pitch when I had to."	Yuniesky Betancourt also homered and Gallardo pulled off the rare feat of striking out four batters in one inning as the Brewers lowered their magic number to five with their fourth win in their last five games and St. Louis's loss at Philadelphia.	Any combination of Milwaukee wins and Cardinal losses adding up to five gives the Brewers their first division championship since 1982, when they won the American League East.	Gallardo's previous single-game strikeout high was 12, which he'd reached four times, including last Sunday. He threw 117 pitches, 75 of them strikes, in his six innings, giving up just two hits, one run, and two walks.	Gallardo is one of several Milwaukee pitchers capable of turning in impressive performances down the stretch, manager Ron Roenicke said.	"He can be that guy," Roenicke said. "He's got the stuff to do that."	Gallardo (17-10) became the second pitcher in Milwaukee to strike out four batters in one inning when Brandon Phillips reached on a third-strike wild pitch with two outs in the fifth. Edgar Renteria struck out swinging to end the inning.	Drew Stubbs struck out twice against Gallardo, pushing him to 195 for the season. That ties the club record set by Adam Dunn in 2004.	Milwaukee grabbed a first inning lead against Reds starter Edinson Volquez. Corey Hart led off by grounding a double between third baseman Juan Francisco and the bag. He moved up on Nyjer Morgan's groundout to second and scored on Braun's broken-bat bloop single to short center field.	Volquez (5-6) has allowed at least one first inning run in nine of his 18 starts. He lasted 6 2/3 innings, giving up six hits and five runs with three walks, six strikeouts and one wild pitch. He also hit a batter.	"It wasn't bad," Volquez said. "I tried to keep the game in line. I made a mistake to Betancourt. I walked one guy, then hit the next. By then, I had too many pitches."	Yonder Alonso tied the score with a home run to lead off the second inning. The 382-foot drive on Gallardo's 3-1 pitch appeared to glance off the glove of leaping center fielder Nyjer Morgan and land in the first row of seats.	The Brewers regained their one-run lead in the fourth on Betancourt's 12th homer of the season, a 391-foot shot into the right-center field seats on a 2-2 pitch with two outs. His two-out single in the sixth drove in Morgan from second, giving Milwaukee a 3-1 lead. Braun added his 31st homer, a three-run shot into the left field seats off of Jose Arredondo, in the seventh.	"I think Braun is at that point in the season -- a lot of the guys are -- where they know where we're at and they're trying to turn it up a notch," Roenicke said. "It's a real good sign that maybe we're going to go on a big roll offensively."	Mark Kotsay had a pinch-hit, three-run double in Milwaukee's four-run eighth, giving the Brewers 16 runs over their last two games.	"If you see it one day, you don't know, but when you see it a couple of days in a row with a lot of guys contributing, it's a good sign," Braun said.	"They beat us up pretty good, and we didn't do much offensively," said Reds manager Dusty Baker, pointing out that the Reds were blown out on the night the team honored Hall of Fame catcher Johnny Bench. "I don't think we impressed Johnny too much with our performance."	Game notes	 The Reds unveiled a statue of Bench outside of Great American Ball Park before the game. He was honored in pre-game ceremonies, which included seeing a portion of the street surrounding the ballpark renamed "Johnny Bench Way," and he threw a ceremonial first pitch to his former teammmate, Hall of Fame second baseman Joe Morgan. ... Brewers 2B Rickie Weeks didn't start Saturday after slightly aggravating the left ankle injury that forced him to miss 39 games from July 27 to Sept. 8. ... Reds C Ryan Hanigan and Ramon Hernandez both were sidelined on Saturday, Hanigan with back spasms and Hernandez with a bruise on his left shin after a foul tip on Friday. ... LHP Dontrelle Willis will take his 13th stab at win No. 1 of the season when he starts Sunday against the Brewers. Willis, 0-6 since being called up from Triple-A Louisville on July 10, has been victimized by three blown saves, including his first start at Milwaukee. ... Brewers RHP Zack Greinke is 2-0 with a 3.00 ERA in two career starts in Cincinnati.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DENVER --  San Francisco manager Bruce Bochy said the task at hand is straightforward for the Giants in the waning days of the regular season.	"We just got to go out there and try to win ballgames," Bochy said. "It's pretty simple at this point. And obviously, we need some help."	The Giants suceeded on both counts Saturday night. They scored four runs in the eighth and then held on to beat the Colorado Rockies 6-5 and extend their winning streak to seven games.	The Giants moved five games behind the Arizona Diamondbacks in the National League West with 10 games to play after Arizona lost at San Diego. San Francisco has made up 4 1/2 games on Arizona in a week.	The Giants are also five games behind the Atlanta Braves in the wild-card race where they are third and trail the St. Louis Cardinals by a half game.	San Francisco scored once in the sixth to go ahead 2-1 only to have the Rockies take a 3-2 lead in the bottom of the inning. That was the Giants' plight in the eighth, when Huston Street came on for the Rockies and Andres Torres led off with a single.	"We feel we've got a shot," Torres said. "I got a base hit and everything started. We just got to play hard and win some games."	Street (1-4), pitching in a set-up role after Rafael Betancourt took over as the closer in mid-August while he was on the disabled list, then fielded Jeff Keppinger's bunt, but threw the ball wide of shortstop Hector Gomez, allowing Torres to take third.	"That's a good throw, it's probably close to being a double play ball," Bochy said. "But we caught a break there."	Carlos Beltran followed with a run-scoring double that sent Keppinger to third. Street then struck out Mark DeRosa.	But Brett Pill, who tripled home the Giants' first run in the sixth off Matt Belisle, tripled again and two runs scored.	"I don't think I've ever had two triples in my life (in a game)," Pill said. "It was hard to breathe when I got to third."	Pill said he benefited from watching Street throw sliders exclusively to DeRosa. Pill fought back from a 1-2 count and drove a 2-2 slider to the gap in left-center.	"He kind of left one over the plate with two strikes, and I just barreled it," said Pill, a 27-year-old rookie who is 7-for-21 with one double, two triples, two homers and six RBI in his first six games in the majors.	"I think the problem area for Huston tonight simply boils down to the inability to make a two-strike pitch," Rockies manager Jim Tracy said. "He had Torres right where he wanted him at two strikes, but he left a changeup enough to where he could serve it into left field. We had an out at second base on the hard bunt by Keppinger. He was going to be out with a good throw...He had two strikes on Pill and left a slider up in the zone. We were in the position we were in to wiggle ourselves of the inning. We weren't able to get out of it."	Matt Lindstrom relieved Street and got pinch hitter Aubrey Huff to ground to first baseman Jordan Pacheco. He was slow throwing the ball home, and Pill scored to make it 6-3.	Santiago Casilla, filling in for injured closer Brian Wilson, earned his fifth save but not without a few anxious moments. He gave up a one-out single to pinch hitter Seth Smith and walked Ty Wigginton. Mark Ellis doubled to score Smith, and Wigginton scored when Wilin Rosario grounded out.	Gomez had gone 2 for 3 in his first major league start, one night after his major league debut, but Casilla struck him out to end the game.	Waldis Joaquin (1-0) retired the two batters he faced in the eighth to earn the victory.	Game notes	 Giants outfielder Cody Ross, who came out of Friday's game in the sixth, underwent an MRI that confirmed a strained right hamstring. He's expected to miss about a week. ... Rockies manager Jim Tracy said center fielder Dexter Fowler would not be in the lineup Sunday. He has started every game since Aug. 15. ... Rockies shortstop Troy Tulowitzki (left hip), first baseman Todd Helton (back) and right fielder Carlos Gonzalez (right wrist) didn't play. Tulowitzki has missed four straight games and six of the past eight. Helton has missed four straight games and 10 of the past 12 games, and Gonzalez missed his second straight game. ... Brian Wilson (right elbow inflammation), who has been on the disabled list retroactive to Aug. 16, played catch Saturday, and Bochy said, "There's a good chance if he comes in tomorrow and feels fine that we will activate him." ... Giants pitcher Jonathan Sanchez (left ankle sprain) could throw off a mound Monday or Tuesday, Bochy said, and might pitch "an inning or so" before the season ends. ... Esmil Rogers, who is 6-5 with a 5.88 ERA overall but 1-2 with a 9.86 ERA at Coors Field, will start for the Rockies. Matt Cain, who is 11-10 with a 2.79 ERA will make his 26th career start against the Rockies and fourth this season. He's 12-7 with a 3.16 ERA against the Rockies.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN DIEGO --  The Arizona Diamondbacks' run at the NL West title is stalling against the last-place San Diego Padres, of all teams.	The Padres surprised Arizona for the second straight night, winning 3-1 on Saturday as Wade LeBlanc and three relievers combined on a five-hitter and Orlando Hudson and Jeremy Hermida hit solo homers.	The Diamondbacks' lead in the NL West was trimmed to five games over the defending World Series champion San Francisco Giants, who won 6-5 at Colorado. Each team has 10 games to play. The Diamondbacks' magic number for clinching the division remained at six, meaning any combination of Diamondbacks wins and Giants losses totaling six will give Arizona the title.	Arizona also was held to five hits in a 2-0 loss to the Padres on Friday night.	"I think we're trying a little too hard probably," said catcher Miguel Montero, who had two doubles off LeBlanc. "The team seems good. It's still looking good. We've just got to play a little better baseball. We've got to come back tomorrow and do a little better."	Arizona lost its third straight game, its longest losing streak since dropping six from Aug. 17-22.	"We've been through these streaks before," manager Kirk Gibson said. "Nobody likes them. We fixed them before. We need to get after it. It's disappointing. But we have nobody to blame but ourselves -- and we're the people who can fix it as well and we will."	With the score tied at 1, Hudson homered onto the top of the out-of-town scoreboard on the right-field wall with two outs in the fourth, his seventh. It came on a full-count pitch from Josh Collmenter (9-10).	Hermida led off the seventh with a homer into the seats in right-center, one of the deepest parts of Petco Park. It was his second.	LeBlanc's only mistake was allowing Aaron Hill's solo shot to left-center on a full-count pitch with one out in the first, his second.	San Diego tied it in the second when Hudson hit a two-out single to right, advanced when Hermida was hit by a pitch and scored on Andy Parrino's single.	LeBlanc (4-5) allowed four hits, struck out four and walked three. Relievers Luke Gregerson and Chad Qualls each threw a scoreless inning before All-Star Heath Bell pitched the ninth for his 39th save in 44 chances. Bell struck out Justin Upton looking and got Miguel Montero to fly out to left before allowing a single to Paul Goldschmidt and walking Chris Young on four pitches. Bell ended it by throwing a called third strike past pinch-hitter Lyle Overbay on a full-count pitch.	"C.Y. and Overbay got me in Arizona so I wasn't going to give in," Bell said. "I fell behind and made some good pitches off Lyle, right on the corner. C.Y., I didn't make that good pitch, but then again I didn't want him to shoot the ball into right. I wasn't going to give in to those guys. I got Lyle instead of C.Y. I had a base.	"That's kind of our motto, defense and pitching," Bell added. "Good fundamental baseball and good pitching. We're starting to get some good pitching from our starters, and our bullpen's doing what it's supposed to be doing."	Collmenter allowed three runs and eight hits in seven innings, struck out two and walked none.	"I think everyone knows what's going on," Collmenter said. "But we have to win it. We're not here to try to play prevent or something. We want to win this thing going away. We don't want to wait around. Guys know what's going on. Everyone kind of pays attention in their own respect whether it's a lot or a little ... Something like this isn't that big of a problem for us, or a hurdle."	Game notes	 The Padres will wait a few days to determine whether RHP Tim Stauffer makes his next start. He left Friday night's win with tightness in his right arm. ... The series concludes Sunday with Arizona LHP Joe Saunders (11-12, 3.83) facing San Diego RHP Aaron Harang (13-6, 3.85). Harang has gone 4-2 with a 2.62 ERA in his last 10 home starts since May 19. ... Saunders threw his first complete game of the season, and sixth of his career, in a 6-1 win against the Padres on July 26.

LOS ANGELES --  Ted Lilly is just getting his second wind at age 35. James Loney is trying to salvage something from a miserable season. Juan Rivera is giving the Los Angeles Dodgers a reminder of what they've missed in the middle of their lineup and some hope for next season.	Loney hit his second three-run homer in two nights, Rivera added a two-run shot and Lilly pitched seven sharp innings, leading the Dodgers to a 6-1 victory over the Pirates on Saturday night.	Lilly (10-14) allowed a run and four hits, struck out seven and walked two. The two-time All-Star, winding up his first full season with the Dodgers, joined CC Sabathia and Mark Buehrle as the only left-handers to reach double digits in wins during each of the past nine seasons. Lilly has a 2.67 ERA over his past 10 starts, lowering his overall ERA to 4.27.	"I'm pretty happy with the accomplishment," said Lilly, who had a career-high 17 wins in 2008 with the Chicago Cubs. "In a way, I think I surprised myself. I've been fortunate to be able to keep going out there and make all my appointments, so to speak. I look back over those nine years, and I've worked hard and done everything I can to be prepared. Basically, I'm going out there and giving it everything I have every five days.	"I lost a lot of games where I got outpitched by the other guy," Lilly said. "This is about competing, and the object is to win. I'm not going out there for a 'quality start.' The goal is to win the game in any way necessary. For the most part this year, I've been on the short end of the stick on a lot of those games. I need to pitch better. That's the bottom line."	"By no means do I see the end near," Lilly added. "I feel like there's a lot of my own personal goals that have yet to be met, and one of those goals is to be playing at the end of October. And I haven't really had an opportunity to do that, so hopefully that happens sooner than later."	All-Star Matt Kemp scored his 100th run in the third inning on Rivera's homer and stole his 40th base in the sixth, becoming the first player in Dodgers franchise history with at least 40 steals, 100 runs scored, 100 RBIs and 30 home runs.	"I didn't even to know I was the first person to do that, so that surprises me to hear that," Kemp said. "I definitely set personal goals at the start of the season, but I don't talk about them because my goals wouldn't come true if I did. I try to come close to reaching them if I can."	James McDonald (9-9) threw 76 pitches over three innings and giving up five runs and seven hits. It was his first appearance against the team that drafted him in the 11th round of the 2002 draft and brought him up to the majors for the first time in 2008.	McDonald matched his shortest outing in 30 starts this season. He also pitched three innings in a 9-5 loss at Florida on April 21, giving up eight runs and six hits.	The Pirates acquired McDonald from Los Angeles at last year's non-waiver trade deadline. Saturday was the third anniversary of his big league debut, when the lanky right-hander pitched a perfect inning of relief at Pittsburgh and struck out two. He was 5-6 with a 4.11 ERA in 53 appearances with Los Angeles, including five starts.	"Maybe I tried to put too much emphasis on this outing because it was the Dodgers," McDonald said. "Maybe I let the game speed up instead of just kind of stepping back and slowing it down. It's something I'll learn from. I wasn't getting ahead of guys. When you get behind good hitters who have an idea, things are not going to work out your way. I should have been more aggressive in the strike zone early in the count."	The Dodgers grabbed a 3-0 lead in the first, as Loney drove a first-pitch homer into the pavilion seats in right-center for his 11th of the season and the 23rd allowed by McDonald.	In Friday's series opener, Loney ended a homerless drought of 57 at-bats on a full count against reliever Chris Resop while pinch-hitting for Justin Sellers in the sixth inning of the Dodgers' 7-2 win. The only other time this season that Loney homered in consecutive games was Aug. 26-27, including a tying solo shot off Colorado's Rafael Betancourt in the ninth inning of a game the Dodgers won 7-6 in 11.	Loney didn't get his average above .250 until June 12, when he had three hits including a home run at Colorado. Since Aug. 21, he is batting .368 with six homers and 21 RBIs and has raised his season average to .276.	Kemp led off the third with a single and Rivera followed with his fourth home run since joining the Dodgers in a trade with Toronto on the day of the All-Star game.	Los Angeles increased the margin to 6-1 in the fifth, when Tim Federowicz singled home Aaron Miles for his first RBI in the major leagues.	Pirates catcher Matt Pagnozzi, the nephew of former St. Louis catcher Tom Pagnozzi, made his Pirates debut in the fifth as a pinch-hitter for reliever Aaron Thompson and hit an opposite-field single on the second pitch he saw.	Once he puts on the gear, Pagnozzi will become the eighth different catcher used this season by manager Clint Hurdle -- the most by the Pirates since 1953 and one shy of the franchise record set in 1914.	Game notes	 The Dodgers were eliminated from the NL wild-card race Saturday with Atlanta's 1-0 victory over the New York Mets. ... Lilly had a career-high 17 wins in 2008 with the Chicago Cubs. ... Pagnozzi became the 52nd player used by the Pirates, breaking the previous club record set last season. ... The Pirates are 17-40 since July 19, when they were 51-44 and led the NL Central by a half-game. They have since plummeted to a season-worst 21 games out of first place. ... Rivera ended an 0-for-19 drought with a first-inning single. In 53 games with the Dodgers, he is hitting .283 with 37 RBIs.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

TORONTO --  The New York Yankees are hoping home is where a division will be won and baseball history will be made.	Mariano Rivera was denied a chance to go for the career saves record Sunday when Adam Lind homered twice to back Brandon Morrow and lead the Toronto Blue Jays to a 3-0 victory.	New York went 4-6 on a trip that started with a makeup game at Baltimore and took the team to Anaheim and Seattle before wrapping up in Canada.	"It's been a tough road trip," manager Joe Girardi said. "This has been a really, really tough stretch. I know our guys are pretty worn down. Hopefully, they get to sleep in their own beds and catch up a little bit."	Alex Rodriguez, who played for the second straight day after missing six games because a sore left thumb, was happy to have the travel over for now.	"I feel like we'll be energized getting home, without a question," Rodriguez said. "It feels like we've been gone for about a month."	Although they'll be back in the Bronx, the schedule doesn't get much easier -- and doesn't include any off-days. The Yankees host Minnesota in an afternoon makeup game Monday, then play four against hard-charging Tampa Bay, including a day-night doubleheader Wednesday.	"We've got to go home and play better, there's no doubt at about it," Girardi said.	New York, which remained a season-high 4½ games ahead of second-place Boston in the AL East, has lost three of four and seven of 11.	What had been a five-game homestand is now eight because of makeups, and it ends with three games against Boston. While at home, the Yankees hope to clinch their 15th playoff berth in 16 seasons.	"We have to have a good homestand," Yankees captain Derek Jeter said. "We're all looking forward to getting back there because we haven't been there in a while."	Rivera, who matched Trevor Hoffman with his 601st save in Saturday's 7-6 win, will try to set the record at Yankee Stadium.	"I'm hoping that he has an opportunity to do it at home, but we have to put him in a position to do it," Jeter said.	Morrow (10-11) allowed four hits in eight innings, struck out eight and walked one. The right-hander, who retired 12 in a row during one stretch, had been 0-4 in six starts since beating Seattle on Aug. 17.	"I needed that one just to get my confidence back," Morrow said. "I'm still trying to finish strong and that's a good place to start."	All four hits off him were singles, and three didn't get out of the infield.	"He had some of the best stuff I've seen all year," New York's Eric Chavez said. "He was throwing the ball well in New York when we faced him last time but today it just seemed to have a little bit more life on it. His slider was down and hard and his fastball away was just taking off."	Morrow said the "slider" actually was a cut fastball, a pitch he'd been working on for weeks and added to his repertoire during his previous start, Sept. 13 at Boston.	"He's taken his slider and tightened it up some," Blue Jays manager John Farrell said. "A lot of the pitches where he was in fastball counts, he would go to the cutter."	Frank Francisco pitched around an Eduardo Nunez double in the ninth for his 16th save in 20 chances. Francisco has converted 11 of his past 12 opportunities.	Lind hit solo homers in the second and fourth off Freddy Garcia (11-8), his third multihomer game this season and the seventh of his career. Lind has 26 homers this season but had not hit once since Sept. 3 at Yankee Stadium.	Garcia (11-8) allowed three runs, five hits and three walks in 4 2/3 innings. He is 1-1 with a 6.56 ERA in his last five starts and has allowed at least two homers in each of his past three outings.	"They made me work," Garcia said. "I was at 80 pitches starting the fifth inning."	New York helped Morrow by getting thrown out twice on the bases. Robinson Cano was caught stealing by catcher J.P. Arencibia on the back end of an attempted double steal in the first, and Nunez was thrown out by right fielder Jose Bautista trying to stretch his sixth-inning single.	Eric Thames drove in Toronto's final run with a fifth-inning sacrifice fly. Thames left during his at bat in the seventh after a foul tip struck him over the left eye, knocking his batting helmet off. Thames suffered a cut over his eye but was not seriously injured.	Game notes	 Besides Jeter, CF Curtis Granderson and 1B Mark Teixeira got the day off, while Cano started at DH. ... A.J. Burnett starts for the Yankees against Minnesota, and Scott Diamond starts for the Twins. New York will start Ivan Nova against Tampa Bay on Tuesday, with CC Sabathia and Phil Hughes getting the starts in Wednesday's day-night doubleheader. Bartolo Colon will start Thursday's series finale. ... New York was shutout for the eighth time this season.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

CINCINNATI -- Prince Fielder and the Milwaukee Brewers haven't been too fond of Great American Ball Park. The way they played here this weekend might help change the way they feel.	Fielder and Carlos Gomez each hit two-run homers in the first and Zack Greinke breezed through seven sharp innings, leading the Brewers to an 8-1 win over the Cincinnati Reds on Sunday for a series sweep.	"It's hard to lose when you pitch and hit," Fielder said. "It feels better when you do it on the road. It's not easy to do it on the road. It gives you extra confidence. We know we can win at home."	Corey Hart added a solo shot in the sixth as Milwaukee polished off its first sweep of a three-game series at Great American, which opened in 2003. Milwaukee's last sweep of a three-game series in Cincinnati was Aug. 30-Sept. 1, 2002. Milwaukee outscored Cincinnati 24-5 in the series while limiting the Reds to two hits in each of the last two games.	Manager Ron Roenicke might've been a little concerned coming into Cincinnati. Milwaukee had lost six of its last eight games going into the series, and the Brewers had lost 12 of their previous 14 games in Cincinnati.	"Guys still felt good coming in," Roenicke said. "We've had trouble here. They came in determined to get back on track, and I think we did that."	The NL Central Division-leading Brewers went into the game with a magic number of five for clinching their first division championship in 29 years. Any combination of Milwaukee wins and St. Louis losses adding up to five would give the Brewers their first title since the 1982 team won the American League East. The Cardinals were scheduled to play Sunday night at Philadelphia.	Reds batters had just 13 hits while striking out 33 times and walking six in the series, leaving manager Dusty Baker looking for answers.	"It was a frustrating weekend," he said. "They beat us up pretty good. We helped them some, but they hit a lot of balls over the wall. They got every kind of hit and everything went their way."	Greinke allowed just one baserunner -- Edgar Renteria, who reached with one out in the fourth on Yuniesky Betancourt's error and was caught stealing while Joey Votto was striking out -- before Juan Francisco lined an opposite-field single to left with two outs in the fifth. Drew Stubbs walked and Francisco scored on Devin Mesoraco's single to left.	Greinke (15-6) allowed just two hits and one run with three walks. He tied his season high with 10 strikeouts.	"I was locating stuff early," Greinke said. "Sometimes, you can be a little inconsistent in the first inning."	He appreciated the early support.	"I wanted them to keep it going," he said. "Seven runs is good if you're doing your job. If you struggle at all, they can come back and make it a game."	Matt Maloney was pressed into service as Cincinnati's starting pitcher after Dontrelle Willis developed back spasms. Maloney had planned to start Monday in place of Johnny Cueto, who left his last start with a strained muscle in his upper right back.	The Brewers wasted no time pouncing on the emergency starter. Hart led off the game with a double to right-center. Gomez then hit the first pitch he saw from Maloney 390 feet into the left field seats for his seventh home run of the season and first since July 1.	Ryan Braun followed with a slow roller halfway up the third base line for an infield single and Fielder hit the first pitch he saw 424 feet down the right-field line for his 34th homer.	Milwaukee knocked Maloney out of the game in the second. Hart, Gomez and Braun all singled to load the bases with one out. Fielder grounded to Votto at first, who forced Hart at the plate. Mesoraco's high return throw glanced off Votto's glove, allowing Gomez to score with Braun and Fielder moving up. They scored on a single to left by Rickie Weeks, Maloney's last batter.	Maloney (0-3) gave up seven runs -- six earned -- on nine hits in 1 2/3 innings. His ERA climbed from 6.88 to 9.16.	"I found out an hour and a half before the game," he said. "I don't blame any of the outing on it. My bullpen was good. My stuff was good. I just got my butt kicked, plain and simple. They got some bleeders, sure, but they count as much as a line drive. I just have to turn the page."	Game notes	 Fielder and Braun both extended hitting streaks, Fielder to 11 games (13 for 38, .342) and Braun to eight(15 for 35, 426.). ... Milwaukee C Jonathan Lucroy has one hit in his last 28 at-bats. ... Milwaukee outfielder Logan Schafer's ninth-inning single was his first major league hit. ... Drew Stubbs' third inning strikeout was his Reds' record 196th of the season, snapping his tie with Adam Dunn, who struck out 195 times in 2004. Stubbs struck out again in the seventh. ... The win was the Brewers' 38th of the season on the road, surpassing their 2010 total of 37. ... LHP Chris Narveson makes his first start since Sept. 8 when the Brewers open a three-game series against the Cubs at Wrigley Field on Monday night. Narveson pitched two innings of relief Wednesday against Colorado and retired all six batters, two on strikeouts. ... The Reds' three-game series that starts Monday against Houston wraps up their home schedule. Willis will start if he is healthy. If not, LHP Travis Wood will start, Baker said.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

BALTIMORE --  Erick Aybar enjoyed the finest day of his career at a time when the Los Angeles Angels needed him the most.	Aybar went 4-for-4, homered twice and tied a franchise record by scoring five runs, leading Los Angeles to an 11-2 victory over the Baltimore Orioles on Sunday.	Aybar's effort provided the Angels a welcome boost in their frantic pursuit of a postseason berth. Los Angeles, which began the day 4½ games in back of division-leading Texas, closed within four games behind Boston in the wild-card hunt.	"A very important win," Aybar said through an interpreter. "I felt great being able to contribute to what was really a team effort. Eleven runs wasn't just all my runs, so I feel good about that."	The victory enabled the Angels to avert a three-game sweep against the last-place Orioles, who won the first two by a collective 14-5 score.	"Everybody felt the need, not just me," Aybar said. "We lost two games in a row and we felt this was a game to win. We need to keep winning."	It was the first career multihomer game for Aybar, who hit a solo shot in the third inning and a two-run drive in the fourth. His four hits tied a career high, as did his four RBIs.	His five runs matched the club record set by Tim Salmon on April 12, 1998, at Cleveland.	"When he's on, he brings a very consistent approach whether he hits with no one on or he hits with someone in scoring position," manager Mike Scioscia said of Aybar. "He usually puts the ball in play. That's rule No. 1 when you're a little guy and not expected to hit home runs."	Vernon Wells also connected for the Angels, who next play a four-game series in Toronto, their final destination on the road this season. Baltimore travels to Boston for four games, beginning with a day-night doubleheader on Monday.	"It was nice to get this win," winning pitcher Jered Weaver said. "Hopefully, we can take this into Toronto and take three of four or four of four."	Pitching on three days' rest, Weaver (18-7) allowed two runs and six hits in six innings. He is 12-3 since the beginning of June, and his 18 wins are two more than his previous career high.	"That's why he's one of the best pitchers in the game right now," said Baltimore catcher Craig Tatum, who went 0-for-3. "He showed he can come back off three days' rest and still be good. His ball moves, he locates, he keeps the ball down. He just didn't give us much to hit."	Vladimir Guerrero homered, tripled and had two RBIs for the Orioles, whose four-game winning streak ended. It was the 449th career home run for Guerrero, tied with Jeff Bagwell for 35th place on the career list.	Alfredo Simon (4-9) gave up six runs and eight hits, including three home runs, in five innings.	Aybar opened the game by drawing a four-pitch walk and scored on a double by Bobby Abreu. Later in the inning, Simon hit Mark Trumbo with a pitch, prompting home plate umpire Laz Diaz to issue a warning to both sides.	One night earlier, Ervin Santana hit Baltimore's Mark Reynolds in the helmet with a pitch. Reynolds, who did not play Sunday, said before the game that Santana purposely threw at him.	And Simon didn't deny doing likewise.	"We just got hit yesterday and I'm going to defend my players," he said. "We just got hit hard and that's what happens in the game."	Brad Bergesen plunked Jeff Mathis on the helmet in the sixth inning but was not ejected. Bergesen did, however, appeared to be obviously dismayed over the errant pitch.	Baltimore tied it in the bottom of the first when Nick Markakis hit a two-out single -- ending an 0-for-18 skid -- and the 36-year-old Guerrero followed with his first triple since July 2010.	Aybar put the Angels up 2-1 in the third with his ninth homer, and Wells hit No. 22 with a man on in the fourth. Three batters later, Aybar drove a pitch over the right-field wall.	Howie Kendrick doubled in two runs in the sixth off Bergesen, and Aybar hit an RBI double in a three-run eighth.	Game notes	 Eight of the Angels' 15 hits were for extra bases. ... Jerome Williams (3-0) will start Monday for the Angels, who are 7-4 in their last 11 games in Toronto. ... Jeremy Guthrie (8-17) and Brian Matusz (1-7, 9.84 ERA) will start for Baltimore on Monday. ... It was Abreu's 30th double, the 12th time in his career he's reached that mark.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

BOSTON -- The ball struck David Price in the chest and bounced in the air, a line drive that had a chance to devastate the Tampa Bay Rays' playoff chances.	But Evan Longoria fielded the carom and threw to first for the out, Price stayed in the game and Tampa Bay beat the Red Sox 8-5 on Sunday to take three out of four from Boston and close within two games in the AL wild-card race.	The Red Sox have lost 11 of their last 14 and are now left rooting for the New York Yankees, who play the Rays seven times in Tampa Bay's last 10 games.	"To be able to do this against this team here, if that can't bolster your confidence nothing really can," Rays manager Joe Maddon said. "Now it becomes more viable. You can see the light at the end of the tunnel, and now it's not attached to an oncoming train."	Tampa Bay already led 3-0 against a wild Tim Wakefield when Mike Aviles hit a hard shot up the middle and off the "Rays" logo below Price's right shoulder. The ball bounced toward third base for a 1-5-3 putout, and trainers went to the mound to look at Price.	After several minutes of examination -- at one point Price sat on the ground and untucked his shirt so the medical staff could look at the bruise -- Price retired Adrian Gonzalez an inning-ending groundout. Price gave up Darnell McDonald's two-run double in the fourth that made it 4-2.	Jake McGee (3-1) relieved and pitched 2 2/3 innings of relief for the win, and Joel Peralta pitched the ninth for his fifth save.	Price went to Massachusetts General Hospital for tests, which were negative, and team spokesman Rick Vaughn said he would join the team at the station for the train ride to New York.	"It was a scary moment," Maddon said. "I'm certain they did everything, and he checked out well. Knowing him, he's going to be ready for his next start."	The Rays will need him.	Tampa Bay, which trailed Boston by nine games on Sept. 3, closed within two games of the wild-card lead for the first time since June. The Red Sox have 10 games left: seven against last-place Baltimore and three at Yankee Stadium; in addition to their seven against the AL East-leading Yankees, the Rays have three against Toronto.	"The Yankees have been playing good against everybody," Red Sox designated hitter David Ortiz said. "We'll see what happens."	Second baseman Dustin Pedroia noted that the Red Sox still had the lead.	"We're winning. We've got to go out and play better. That's basically it," he said. "I'm real confident. We've got a great team and we've got to find a way to figure it out. We've got a two-game lead with 10 games to go. We're not going to sit back and feel sorry for ourselves. We've got to win. I've already turned the page."	Matt Joyce had three hits and three RBIs and the Rays capitalized on Wakefield's knuckleball to beat Boston for the eighth time in nine games. Wakefield (7-7) threw one wild pitch and catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia muffed four of his knucklers for passed balls, miscues that contributed to three runs.	Entering with a 6-2 lead, McGee retired his first eight batters before Marco Scutaro's single chased him with two outs in the seventh. Jacoby Ellsbury singled, Aviles hit a three-run homer before Cesar Ramos struck out Gonzalez.	By then, it was too late.	The Rays didn't have much trouble with Wakefield's knuckler, but Saltalamacchia did.	Tampa Bay went ahead 3-0 in the second after Casey Kotchman led off by reaching on a passed ball on a third strike. He took second on another passed ball and scored on Johnny Damon's double.	In the fourth, Joyce doubled, took third on a passed ball and scored on Sean Rodriguez's sacrifice fly. And the Rays got another knuckler-aided run in the fifth when Desmond Jennings singled, stole second, took third on a wild pitch and scored on a passed ball.	Wakefield allowed six runs -- two earned -- six hits, one walk, one wild pitch and a hit batter in five innings. The 45-year-old earned victory No. 200 in his previous outing, his only win in his last 10 starts.	Andrew Miller added a wild pitch in the seventh that helped another run score. Aviles also had two throwing errors at third base, contributing to one more run.	Game notes	 Wakefield pitched his 3,000th inning as a member of the Red Sox -- the first player in franchise history to reach the milestone. Only the Cincinnati franchise had been around as long as Boston without having one pitcher throw 3,000 innings. ... The Rays finished 7-2 in Fenway Park and 12-6 against Boston this season. ... Maddon had his team wearing high school-style letter sweaters for the train ride to New York to face the Yankees. Wade Davis (10-9) will face Ivan Nova (15-4) in the opener on Tuesday. The Red Sox have a day-night doubleheader against the Baltimore Orioles on Monday, with Kyle Weiland (0-2) starting the opener for Boston and John Lackey (12-12) pitching the night game. ... Price is the only Rays starter without a complete game. ... Red Sox INF Kevin Youkilis missed his third straight game because of a sports hernia. "He needs some time down, whether it's days or weeks, we don't know," Red Sox manager Terry Francona said.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

ATLANTA -- The New York Mets were reeling when they arrived in Atlanta. They left with renewed confidence.	"We still show fight," pitcher Dillon Gee said after Sunday's 7-5 win over the Atlanta Braves. "We care. It just shows that we pull together and try to pull through the rough patches."	Ruben Tejada had four RBIs, Lucas Duda homered off Craig Kimbrel in the ninth inning and the New York Mets slowed the Braves' wild-card bid with a walk-filled victory.	Atlanta, which is 3½ games ahead of St. Louis in the NL wild-card standings, lost two of three to the Mets, who arrived with a six-game losing streak. New York went 6-4 at Atlanta this year, its first winning record at Turner Field since 2008.	New York showed the kind of tenacity that manager Terry Collins said was lacking during a 1-8 homestand that ended Thursday.	"Even late in the season, where we're not really playing for anything, (the Braves) want to win over there," Gee said, "so we want to come in and play the best we can."	Tejada put the Mets ahead 4-1 with a three-run double in a four-run fourth. After pinch-hitter Ronny Paulino's bases-loaded walk in the eighth against Jonny Venters (6-2) tied it at 5, Tejada singled to put the Mets ahead for good.	Duda's homer was just the second this year off Kimbrel, the NL saves leader.	"Craig's one of the best," Duda said. "Luckily, I just connected and it went out of the park."	Tim Byrdak (2-0) won despite allowing a go-ahead single in the seventh to Freddie Freeman, who had been on an 0-for-15 slide. Manny Acosta got four outs for his second save in five chances.	"We gave up the go-ahead run, but this team has been battling back all year, and that's exactly what we did today," Byrdak said. "To get a win out of it is great, but our job in the bullpen is to pick each other up down there."	Venters walked three in the eighth for Atlanta, which walked nine overall. The teams combined for 17 walks.	"The last time I faced him, all the pitches I swung at were balls," Paulino said of Venters. "I decided to be more selective this time. I know he has a good sinker, and you have to have a specific zone to look for. I didn't he threw it where I was looking for it."	Venters, who leads the majors with 81 appearances, insisted he isn't bothered by fatigue.	"I just didn't throw the ball over the plate today," Venters said. "No excuses. I just couldn't throw strikes. It's September. It's time to dig down deep. I cost my team the win. Just go out tomorrow and try to get it done."	Chipper Jones' RBI double put the Braves ahead in the third, but Brandon Beachy walked Gee with the bases loaded in the fourth and Tejada followed with a three-run double.	Atlanta tied it in the bottom half on Alex Gonzalez's solo homer, Michael Bourn's run-scoring single and Dan Uggla's RBI groundout.	A rookie making his first career appearance against New York, Beachy allowed five runs, five hits and four walks in 4 1/3 innings with eight strikeouts. Gee gave up four runs, eight hits and five walks in 4 1/3 innings. His ERA has climbed to 4.48 from 3.05 on June 10.

WASHINGTON -- With that familiar slow delivery -- reaching both hands behind his head -- and that familiar biting sinker, Chien-Ming Wang is looking more and more like the pitcher who twice won 19 games in a season for the Yankees.	Except now, at long last healthy again, Wang is with the Washington Nationals, and he'd like to stay with the club that gave him a chance to return to the majors.	Making the longest start of his comeback from surgery on his pitching shoulder, Wang left with two outs in the seventh inning Sunday, and rookie Chris Marrero drove in two runs, helping Washington edge the Florida Marlins 4-3.	"I really appreciate their patience the last two years. Hopefully in the future I can win more games for them," Wang said through an interpreter. "Hopefully I can come back here, but the decision is made by the team. But personally, I would like to come back."	Wang (3-3) gave up three runs and six hits, didn't walk a batter and struck out five in his 6 2/3 innings.	"The main thing is he's starting to trust that he's healthy. He's throwing more quality pitches," Nationals manager Davey Johnson said. "He's getting more confidence it's going to hold up. That was a severe injury."	This game marked Wang's 10th appearance -- one had lasted 6 1/3 innings -- since returning to the big leagues on July 29, exactly two years after his right shoulder operation. Until then, he hadn't been on a mound in the majors since July 4, 2009, when he was with New York.	Just as when he was dominating AL batters for the Yankees, Wang got groundball out after groundball out Sunday: Only four of the 20 outs he recorded were flyballs.	"Each time he's toed that rubber, he's gotten a little better. It's turning into a pretty good success story for him," Nationals outfielder Jonny Gomes said. "If he just came back and pitched, that would be pretty awesome. To come back and pitch at this level and have success, that's icing on the cake."	Wang hadn't won a game since Aug. 16 against the Cincinnati Reds, going 0-1 in five starts since.	But the right-hander was much better Sunday. He allowed runs on Gaby Sanchez's fifth-inning solo shot and Brett Hayes' two-run homer in the seventh -- both liners to left that barely cleared the wall.	"Kept the hitters off balance. Changed speeds well," Marlins manager Jack McKeon said. "I think it's a good sign for the Nationals. Maybe this guy next year is part of their rotation and can come back and pitch like he did when he was with the Yankees."	Wang made it sound as if he'd like to be in Washington in 2012.	He's playing under a one-year contract that was worth $1 million plus incentives for 2011. He also got a one-year deal in 2010, but didn't make it back to the big leagues last season.	After Hayes' homer pulled Florida to 4-3, Wang departed to a partial standing ovation. Tyler Clippard got the next four outs, and closer Drew Storen pitched the ninth for his 38th save in 43 chances.	At this point of the season, the only thing truly at stake for either the Nationals or Marlins is avoiding a last-place finish in the NL East, so some individual players are keen to make an impression with next year in mind.	Wang did exactly that, as did first baseman Marrero.	Florida rookie Brad Hand (1-8), meanwhile, lost his fifth consecutive start, allowing four runs -- three earned -- and five hits in four innings.	Marrero's sacrifice fly in the second made it 1-0, and Washington scored three in the fourth.	With two on, Espinosa lined a single to center, and the ball hopped over the glove of hard-charging center fielder Bryan Petersen and kept bouncing and rolling for several feet.	By the time Petersen corralled it, two runs had scored and Espinosa was on third. Espinosa entered the game with 60 RBIs as a rookie, but none since Sept. 4. Marrero followed with a ground-rule double that made it 4-0.	"I've worked my whole life to get to the big leagues," Marrero said. "I'm here, and I just want to keep moving up and keep doing my thing."	Game notes	 After a day off Monday, the Nationals open a four-game series at the NL East champion Philadelphia Phillies with a day-night doubleheader Tuesday, a result of an Aug. 14 rainout. ... Washington will start a pair of LHPs in the doubleheader, Ross Detwiler and rookie Tommy Milone -- and the Phillies are 30-11 against lefties this season, including 16-4 at home. ... Detwiler is still seeking his first career road win; he is 0-9 in 18 appearances on the road, including 12 starts. ... Sunday's game closed an 11-game, 10-day road trip to four cities for the Marlins; they went 6-5. It was their first four-city trip since June 2005. ... On Monday, Florida opens a three-game series at home against the Atlanta Braves. The Marlins are only 4-11 against the Braves this season. Florida will start RHP Ricky Nolasco in the series opener, while Atlanta sends LHP Mike Minor to the mound.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- A.J. Pierzynski went on the disabled list for the first time in his career when he was hit by a pitch from Bruce Chen on Aug. 12 and broke his left wrist.	Pierzynski got a measure of revenge Sunday against Chen and the Kansas City Royals, homering twice among his four hits and driving in four runs as the Chicago White Sox snapped a seven-game losing streak with a 10-5 victory over the Royals.	"It's still stinging and bothers me a bit," Pierzynski said. "It was nice to have a good day and get a win. It feels like its been a while. That gives us a chance to relax a bit. You feel like every day you're grinding, grinding, grinding and now we're going towards the offseason."	Paul Konerko and Pierzynski had back-to-back homers leading off the seventh against rookie reliever Louis Coleman. It was Konerko's 30th home run. Konerko, who also singled home Juan Pierre in the eighth for his 103rd RBI, has reached 30 home runs and 100 RBIs for the fifth time in his career.	"It's one of those things that when I came into the season that I kind of felt like that's my job, to drive in runs," Konerko said. "The last couple of years I've been kind of in a mode of switching up goals. I feel like if I can stay healthy and get in 150 games, the by product will be the numbers."	The White Sox took an early 4-0 lead in ending the Royals' seven-game winning streak, Kansas City's longest run since notching seven in a row Sept. 13-18, 2008.	"I'm kinda like bummed out that I lost the game because we're on a roll and playing really good," Chen said. "I was mixing in my pitches well, but unfortunately we didn't come out with a win. We're playing good and I wanted to keep it going."	Pierzynski's three-run homer off Jesse Chavez in the eighth struck the right-field foul pole. It was Pierzynski's fourth career multihomer game -- the past two have been at Kauffman Stadium, his previous coming July 9, 2010.	Brent Morel's double in the second scored Pierzynski and Dayan Viciedo, who had both singled.	In the fourth, Adam Dunn doubled home Alex Rios for his first extra-base hit against a left-hander, in his 89th at-bat this season. Dunn stopped at third on Viciedo's single and scored on Gordon Beckham's sacrifice fly.	The Royals scored a pair of runs in the fifth with Yamaico Navarro and Billy Butler getting the RBIs. Johnny Giavotella's triple in the sixth scored Jeff Francoeur, cutting the White Sox lead to 4-3. Giavotella's third hit in the ninth scored Eric Hosmer.	Hosmer, who had three hits, had an RBI single in the seventh. The Royals collected 15 hits.	"And we still lost," Royals manager Ned Yost said.	Left-hander John Danks (7-12), who was 0-3 with a 10.91 ERA in his previous three starts allowed 10 hits and four runs in six-plus innings.	"He wasn't perfect, but he made the pitches when he had to and that's what you want to see," Pierzynski said.	Chen (11-8) took the loss and is 1/3 in four September starts. He allowed four runs on nine hits and two walks in 5 1/3 innings.	Game notes	 Beckham, who leads AL second baseman with a .992 fielding percentage, was charged with his second error in 49 games when he mishandled Francoeur's bouncer in the sixth. ... Navarro made his first start at shortstop For Royals. He had started five games at third base. ... Pierre leads the AL with 43 infield hits and 19 bunt hits. ... The Royals and White Sox are both off Monday. The White Sox play a doubleheader Tuesday at Cleveland and will start Gavin Floyd and Dylan Axelrod. ... RHP Luis Mendoza, who was the Pacific Coast League pitcher of the year after going 12-5 with a 2.18 ERA for Triple-A Omaha, will start Tuesday against Detroit, the AL Central champions. It will be Mendoza's first big league start since Aug. 13, 2008, while with Texas.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Sometimes earning a win comes down to having one good inning or taking advantage of one good opportunity. The Cleveland Indians proved that Sunday.	For six innings, the Indians had little answer for Minnesota starter Carl Pavano. They couldn't score, they couldn't get multiple hits in an inning and they couldn't generate any momentum.	But given an extra out in the seventh because of a Minnesota error, Cleveland made the Twins pay. With Shelley Duncan homering and hitting a two-run double off of the left-field wall in the inning, the Indians scored six times and sent 11 hitters to plate in their 6-5 victory.	"The whole season they've been very relentless and have never given up," Cleveland manager Manny Acta said. "They know we're one good inning from doing stuff like that. Pavano was pitching so well and we just hung in there and when he came out of the game, we took advantage and had some good at-bats and Shelley had the big hit."	It was a fitting inning for a game that featured a combined six errors, two hit batters and four runs walked in.	After Duncan homered to lead off the seventh, Cleveland's Lonnie Chisenhall reached on what would be a costly error by Minnesota first baseman Chris Parmalee. After fielding a grounder, Parmalee threw wide to Pavano at first and Chisenhall was safe.	The Twins quickly got the next two outs, but Cleveland took advantage of the extra out and loaded the bases. Minnesota relievers Jose Mijares and Alex Burnett each walked in a run, allowing Cleveland to tie the game at 3.	Cleveland's Jim Thome -- who spent all of 2010 and much of 2011 with the Twins -- gave Cleveland a 4-3 lead with a broken bat single that didn't leave the infield.	Batting for the second time in the inning, Duncan hit a line drive that hit the left-field wall to drive in two runs and give Cleveland a 6-3 lead.	"Shelly Duncan was the key guy offensively," Acta said. "Not only with the home run that got us on the board against Pavano, who had our number the whole day, but also the two-run double that proved to be the key in that inning."	For Duncan, the key was getting a few looks at Pavano.	"He's crafty, but third time through the lineup, you saw people get more comfortable with him, taking better at-bats," Duncan said. "We put him on the ropes and got him out of the game and went from there."	The big inning also got Justin Masterson (12-10) the victory in a game that was played in an on-and-off drizzle.	"You knew something crazy was going to happen with the weather and it turned out in our favor," Masterson said. "Every time the ball was in the grass, it was nice and wet and saturated. You knew every play was going to be a difficult one."	Masterson pitched six innings, giving up three runs -- one earned -- on seven hits. Chris Perez pitched a scoreless ninth for his 34th save in 38 chances.	The win allowed the Indians to secure their first three-game sweep since mid-June. In addition, Cleveland moved back to .500 on the season (75-75) and closer to the franchise's first winning season since 2007.	"We're not done yet, we've got a lot of games to play," Acta said. "But it's very important to us. Our goal is to finish second and to play above .500. To go back home, it's very important and hopefully we can have a good homestand and end the season on a very positive note.	"It was a good bounceback series after being swept in Texas."	Pavano (8-13) lost despite being sharp for six-plus innings. He gave up four runs, though only one was earned.	The Twins, who started a lineup that featured only one opening-day starter, scored twice in the bottom of the eighth to cut Cleveland's lead to 6-5. After hitting Matt Tolbert with a pitch to load the bases, Cleveland reliever Vinnie Pestano walked in two runs.	Hughes scored his third run of the game in the sixth to give Minnesota a 3-0 lead on Brian Dinkelman's single. Dinkelman finished with his first career four-hit game.	In the second, Hughes scored on Joe Benson's groundout. In the bottom of the fourth, he scored again, this time when Lou Marson threw ball into center field in an attempt to throw out Benson on an attempted steal.	Minnesota's Jason Repko left the game after being hit in the head by a pitch from Masterson in the bottom of the sixth. Repko walked off of field with assistance and was taken to Hennepin County Medical Center for evaluation, but was back in the Twins clubhouse after the game.	"The ball just flew out of my hand," Masterson said. "I don't mind hitting people, just not in the head. You don't ever want to see a ball go up there."	Game notes	 Both teams have one-game makeups Monday. David Huff (2-5) will pitch for Cleveland against Seattle in a makeup of a May 14 rainout. The Indians will then host the Chicago White Sox for four games in three days. Minnesota was scheduled to fly to New York on Sunday night for a one-game makeup against the Yankees before returning home to face the Mariners. Scott Diamond (1-4) will start for the Twins against the Yankees. ... Because of the quick, one-game trip to New York, the Twins are leaving the rest of the starting rotation and several injured players in Minnesota.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO --  Astros manager Brad Mills was pretty certain the review would go his way.	"When I saw it, the ball got mixed up somehow in the ivy," Mills said. "If the ball went over the fence and then came back, there's no way gonna hit the ivy. It's an impossibility."	Brett Myers benefited from a reversed homer call to beat the Cubs again and Clint Barmes had a two-run single to help the Houston Astros to a 3-2 victory over Chicago on Sunday.	With Chicago down by a run in the eighth and Starlin Castro on first, Carlos Pena hit a drive to left that was initially ruled a two-run homer. The call was overturned after umpires reviewed video of the play.	Pena was given a double and Castro was put on third base, then Marlon Byrd flied out to end the threat.	The inning started off in strange fashion when Darwin Barney's medium-depth fly to right was missed by Brian Bogusevic in right field and rolled to the warning track. Barney reached third standing up on a three-base error.	After Castro walked, pinch-hitter Aramis Ramirez hammered a drive to the right-field wall that Bogusevic tracked down with a nice running catch, scoring Barney.	"Bogie lost that one ball in the lights, but he came back and made a great play on Ramirez's sac fly," Mills said.	Myers struck out Bryan LaHair before Pena hit a flyball to left that was originally ruled a two-run homer after appearing to strike the wall behind the basket in front of the fence and bounce back onto the field.	After Mills protested, the umpires reviewed video of the play and determined that Pena's ball struck the front of the basket.	Cubs manager Mike Quade ran onto the field to argue and was eventually ejected by third base umpire Marty Foster. Quade admitted that the umpires were correct in reversing the home run, but felt that Castro should have scored on the play.	"Marty's got the decision on whether it's a home run or not, and he's also got the decision on where the runner is," Quade said. "I'm sure they got the technique correct, I just wonder how you can see both things."	Byrd flied out against reliever Mark Melancon to end the inning.	"When you get a break, you've to be able to take advantage of it. Mark did a great job of doing it," Mills said.	Meanwhile, as deliberations before and after the replay dragged on, the rain continued to fall and puddles began to form around the infield. The tarp was brought out and there was a rain delay of 1 hour, 7 minutes after the eighth.	"That last inning before we got off the field and they pulled the tarp, it was starting to puddle up," Barmes said. "It wasn't very good. I definitely couldn't have seen us going any further."	Once the game resumed, Melancon returned for the bottom of the ninth and struck out the Cubs in order for his 18th save.	"(Melancon) wanted this," Mills said. "He threw the ball extremely outstanding."	Myers (6-13) held Chicago to two runs -- one earned -- over 7 2/3 innings under a steady drizzle on a cool day at Wrigley Field. He improved to 13-3 lifetime against the Cubs.	"I take it as another game really," Myers said. "I did have my major league debut here and I did grow up watching the Cubs and Braves a lot. I don't know, I don't think that has anything really to do with it. I think it has to do with going out there and trying to execute pitches."	Myers outpitched Ryan Dempster (10-13), who overcame a shaky start to throw seven solid innings. Dempster held the Astros to two runs and seven hits but lost his season-high fifth straight decision.	Coming off a 128-pitch, six-walk start in his previous outing, Dempster struggled through a 33-pitch first inning. Martinez hit an RBI single and Barmes singled home two runs in Houston's three-run opening frame. Dempster gave up three hits and walked two in the inning.	"The two pitches they hit were both 0-2 pitches that were balls and they did a good job of putting the bat on the ball," Dempster said. "It's unfortunate because those runs right there were what ended up costing us the game."	Game notes	 Castro doubled to lead off Chicago's first, becoming the first Cubs shortstop to reach safely in 31 straight games since Woody English, who had streaks of 34 games in 1929 and a 32 games in 1930. ... DJ Lemahieu's second-inning error gave the Cubs 127 miscues on the season, one more than last season and the team's most since they had 139 errors in 1999. Entering Sunday's game, the Cubs have committed at least seven more errors than every other team in baseball. ... Casey Coleman will look to snap a five-game losing streak when he starts Chicago's series opener against Milwaukee's Chris Narveson on Monday night. ... Houston's J.A. Happ try to avoid moving into a tie for the NL lead with 16 losses when he starts Monday's series opener in Cincinnati.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DENVER --  The San Francisco Giants headed home with their playoff hopes still alive.	Pablo Sandoval homered twice in an eight-run fourth inning, part of a six-home run barrage that led the late-charging Giants over the Colorado Rockies 12-5 Sunday for their eighth straight win.	On its longest winning streak since April 2007, San Francisco closed within four games of Atlanta, the NL wild-card leader.	"We've done what we needed to do," manager Bruce Bochy said. "It's obvious we need help. We've got to find a way to get (wins) and see what happens at the end."	Pitcher Matt Cain, Mike Fontenot, Brandon Belt and Brandon Crawford also homered for the Giants, who remained five games back of Arizona in the NL West.	The defending World Series champions have nine games left, including three against the Diamondbacks.	"We feel like we've got a really good shot," Belt said.	Cain (12-10) allowed five runs -- three earned -- five hits, four walks and two hit batters in five innings. He helped himself with two hits, including his first home run since May 13, 2008, against Houston.	"I never found a rhythm," he said. "I was really working and putting a lot of pressure on myself throughout the five innings."	Bochy said he was one batter from taking Cain out in the fifth, but Cain got Tommy Field to hit into an inning-ending double play.	"He looked like he didn't know how to pitch with a lead like that," Bochy said.	In a four-game sweep of the Rockies, the Giants piled up 35 runs and 48 hits. Sandoval led the way with a seven hits, including three homers, in three games. He started the series by hitting for the cycle Thursday and ended it with his second multihomer game this season.	"What a series he had," Bochy said. "Pretty impressive. Pablo was locked in."	Sandoval led off the fourth with a homer to center off Esmil Rogers (6-6). One out later, Belt homered and Crawford doubled. Cain followed with a homer to center.	Sandoval ended the rally with his 22nd homer, a drive into the right-field bleachers for 10-1 lead.	"I said to my teammates, `I got the hard ones. We'll see what happens.' When you get the hard ones, it's tough to get the easy ones," Sandoval said. "I wasn't thinking about the cycle, you just want to get a pitch to drive the guy in. I got a good pitch, and I hit a home run."	Fontenot had given the Giants a 2-0 lead with a two-run homer in the first.	Colorado scored twice each in the fourth and fifth innings to close the gap, but a solo homer by Crawford helped the Giants stay comfortably ahead.	Ty Wigginton and Seth Smith had two hits each for Colorado, which has lost five of six.	Rogers allowed nine runs and seven hits in 3 2/3 innings, dropping to 0-4 with a 7.81 ERA since winning three straight starts in late July and early August.	"The ball was very true going through the strike zone and somewhere between belt and mid-thigh area," Rockies manager Jim Tracy said. "When you do that, you're going to get hit by good big league hitters. That's exactly what happened."	Game notes	 The Giants activated closer Brian Wilson from the 15-day DL. ... The previous San Francisco player to homer twice in the same inning was Juan Uribe last Sept. 23 against the Chicago Cubs. ... The last time the Giants hit four home runs in one inning was Aug. 23, 1961, at Cincinnati. They last hit six homers in one game Aug. 7, 2006, at Arizona. ... The Giants open a three-game home series against the Dodgers on Tuesday. Two-time NL Cy Young Award winner Tim Lincecum will face Clayton Kershaw in the opener. ... Colorado finishes its home schedule with a three-game series against San Diego starting Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  The AL Central title clinched for the Detroit Tigers, Justin Verlander has a goal -- and it has nothing to do with the AL Cy Young Award.	The Tigers are looking for homefield advantage, for their fans as much as for themselves.	"I'd like to start at home," Verlander said Sunday when he led the Tigers over the Oakland Athletics 3-0 and became the first pitcher in nine years to reach 24 wins.	After clinching its first division title since 1987 on Friday, Detroit (89-64) is one game ahead of Texas (88-65) for No. 2 seed in the AL playoffs -- and homefield advantage in the first round. In the event of a tie, Tigers hold the tiebreaker because Detroit swept Texas 6-0 in the season series.	"I want the home crowd behind me," Verlander said. "I know it will be loud since they haven't seen it since 2006. It would be nice to play in front of them."	Verlander (24-5) won his 12th straight start, pitching three-hit ball over eight innings. He struck out six and walked three, extending his scoreless streak to 17 innings.	"The champagne bottles are packed and gone, and the cigars are gone," Tigers manager Jim Leyland said. "We have another mission and that's to get homefield advantage. If there's a fifth game, we want our fans to see it."	He became the first pitcher to win 12 straight starts since Minnesota's Johan Santana in 2004, according to STATS LLC. Verlander has a 2.28 ERA with 91 strikeouts in 87 innings over his streak.	"Brilliant, unbelievable, outstanding. Write one down and use it, or use all three," Tigers' catcher Alex Avila said.	Verlander pitched to the minimum 11 batters until giving up a two-out single to Coco Crisp in the fourth. Scott Sizemore singled in the first, but was thrown out attempting to steal.	Verlander has the most wins in a major league season since Arizona's Randy Johnson in 2002. With another victory, he would become the winningest pitcher in a season since Oakland's Bob Welch went 27-6 in 1990.	"He prepares as hard as anybody and can translate it into action. His attention to detail is unbelievable," Avila said. "He's been able to do exactly what he wants to do and can make changes if he has to."	Verlander set a Tigers record by winning 12 straight starts. He is the first Tigers pitcher to win a dozen consecutive decisions since Bobo Newsom won 13 straight in 1940.	"There's no question about it, he's making a case for himself," Leyland said. "He was scoreless again today. That's a special talent doing something special."	Jose Velvarde pitched the ninth to remain perfect in 46 save chances his season.	For Oakland, Guillermo Moscoso (8-9) took a no-hit bid into the sixth but had thrown 90 pitches by then.	Austin Jackson, who had two hits and scored twice, led off the sixth with his 10th home run of the year, a drive that just cleared the center-field fence. Pinch-hitter Brandon Inge doubled in a run against Craig Breslow in the eighth, and Ramon Santiago drove in a run in the ninth with a squeeze bunt.	Moscoso lasted six innings and matched his season high with eight strikeouts.	"I got behind in the count a couple times but I was able to throw my slider for strikes and get out of trouble," Moscoso said. "We got Verlander on the other side and he's having a great year. We tried to do our best but we didn't score early so my job was to stay in the game and go deep."	Game notes	 Oakland has been shut out in five of Moscoso's starts. ... Tigers INF Carlos Guillen left in the bottom of the fourth because of a strained right calf. He was to be reevaluated Monday. ... RHP Rich Harden (4-3, 4.76) starts for the A's against the Texas Rangers on Tuesday. He's 0-1 with a 6.97 ERA over his last four starts. ... RHP Brad Penny 10-10, 5.07) will start for the Tigers at Kansas City on Tuesday. The Tigers have won his last three starts, and Penny is 3-1 over his last seven starts. He lost his only career start in Kansas City. ... A's OF Hideki Matsui (1-for-19 on the homestand) and INF Cliff Pennington were given the day off. ... Jonah Hill, who plays Peter Brand in the upcoming "Moneyball" movie, threw out the ceremonial first pitch. He was accompanied by Chris Pratt (Scott Hatteberg), Casey Bond (Chad Bradford), Stephen Bishop (David Justice) and the real Scott Hatteberg.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

SAN DIEGO --  With the San Francisco Giants getting hot, the Arizona Diamondbacks know they have to keep winning.	Joe Saunders took a five-hitter into the ninth inning, Paul Goldschmidt drove in three runs and the Diamondbacks beat the San Diego Padres 5-1 Sunday to cut the magic number to five for their first NL West title since 2007.	Arizona maintained a five-game lead over second-place San Francisco with nine games remaining, stopping a three-game losing streak. The Diamondbacks open a nine-game homestand Monday against Pittsburgh, then host the Giants for a three-game series next weekend.	"When you go on a little stretch and you get a little antsy like that, you start to press a little bit," Saunders said. "You just need to relax. When you relax, things come easier to you. I think that's what happened. They didn't try to do to much and we just played our game."	San Francisco kept the pressure on the Diamondbacks with its eighth straight win, 12-5 at Colorado.	"It's been a couple of days, so it's a good feeling," Arizona manager Kirk Gibson said. "Every victory at this point of the season is great. The Giants have been playing great and are on a big winning streak. We needed to match that and take care of our own business."	Saunders (12-12) wanted to make sure he did his job at Petco Park, where he has pitched his best games this season.	The lefty limited last-place San Diego to an unearned run and seven hits in 8 2/3 innings, improving to 3-1 with a 1.47 ERA against the Padres this year. He threw his only complete game this season in a 6-1 win at San Diego on July 26.	"I came in this morning and decided I need to go out there and throw my `A' game," Saunders said. "We got some clutch hits down the stretch. We're grinding it out. It was a good win for us."	After Saunders allowed two-out singles by Kyle Blanks and Alberto Gonzalez in the ninth, J.J. Putz struck out pinch-hitter Nick Hundley for his 41st save in 45 chances.	Goldschmidt led the Arizona offense, which managed just three runs during the losing streak. Goldschmidt had three hits, including a leadoff homer in the sixth that put the Diamondbacks ahead for good at 2-1.	"We just couldn't get to Joe Saunders," Padres manager Bud Black said. "His assortment of fastballs in, fastballs down and away. We just couldn't get enough balls squared against him."	Aaron Harang (13-7) allowed two runs and eight hits in six innings. He has lost four of his last five starts despite a 3.19 ERA in that span.	Cameron Maybin had a leadoff single in the third, stole second, took third on Miguel Montero's throwing error from behind the plate and scored on Jason Bartlett's groundout.	Montero's 17th homer tied the score leading off the fourth. Goldschmidt put the Diamondbacks ahead 2-1 with a leadoff homer in the sixth.	"It was just a first-pitch fastball up and away," Goldschmidt said. "He likes to get ahead with fastballs, so I was looking for it."	Goldschmidt combined with Aaron Hill for RBI singles in the seventh against Brad Brach and added a sacrifice fly against Erik Hamren in the eighth.	Game notes	 Arizona was 11-7 against San Diego, which is 23-43 against the NL West. ... RHP Ian Kennedy (19-4, 2.99 ERA) will attempt to become the NL's first 20-game winner this season Monday when he faces Pittsburgh RHP Jeff Karstens (9-8, 3.45). ... San Diego LHP Corey Luebke (5-9, 3.27) will start the opener of a three-game series, the club's final road games, at Colorado against RHP Kevin Millwood (3-2, 3.68).	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

SEATTLE --  Ultimately, keeping a comfortable lead in the AL West race with just nine games left was of foremost importance to Adrian Beltre.	But getting the better of friend and former teammate Felix Hernandez wasn't far behind.	"It was nice because he's always talking smack to me. We talk smack back and forth and he got my number," Beltre said. "I told him all I wanted to do was take him deep and I did it so I was yapping back to him."	Beltre got to Hernandez on Sunday, hitting a two-strike pitch for a two-run homer in the fourth inning and propelling the Texas Rangers to a 3-0 win over the Seattle Mariners.	Beltre lined his 27th homer of the season into the left field bullpen, then playfully jawed with Hernandez (14-13) as he approached home plate. It was just Beltre's second hit of the three-game series, both home runs.	And it was just his second career hit off the Mariners ace. Beltre had one single in eight previous at-bats and four strikeouts.	"You can't miss. The thing about Felix, playing with him, playing behind him, he's nasty," Beltre said. "He don't leave many pitches over the heart of the plate and his ball moves all over the place so it's not easy to square him up."	While Beltre's homer was the key offensive blow, Texas starter Matt Harrison was even more impressive. Harrison (13-9) won his third straight start, striking out a career-high nine in 6 2/3 shutout innings.	It was an important victory for Texas, remaining 4½ games ahead of the Los Angeles Angels in the AL West after the Angels beat Baltimore earlier Sunday. After an off day Monday, the Rangers open a three-game series in Oakland.	The goal is simple for the Rangers: Make sure the division race is sealed by the time they get to Anaheim to close the regular season with a three-game series.	"We haven't blinked. There is baseball to be played and we're going to play our game," Michael Young said. "So far, so good. We just want to keep it up."	With Harrison winning his 13th game, the Rangers became the first AL team since 1977 to have five pitchers with at least 13 victories. In the last 30 years only three teams have accomplished that feat, all in the National League.	Harrison allowed six hits and walked a pair, and took advantage of the strikeout-prone Mariners. Seattle batters have struck out at least nine times in nine of the past 10 games. Over those 10 games, Seattle has struck out 120 times.	"Going up against that guy you know it's always tough," Harrison said of facing Hernandez. "You just try and keep the game close and make your pitches and try and stay in the game as long as possible."	Only once did Seattle advance a runner to third base against Harrison and that came in the seventh inning. Harrison left with two outs after Ichiro Suzuki's infield hit glanced off Harrison's glove. Suzuki's 173rd hit of the season loaded the bases for Luis Gonzalez, who had doubled off Harrison in his previous at-bat.	Instead of risking it, Rangers manager Ron Washington went to Koji Uehara. The move worked as Uehara struck out Luis Rodriguez to end Seattle's best scoring chance.	Josh Hamilton robbed Mike Carp of a homer with a leaping catch at the wall in left to end the eighth inning and Neftali Feliz picked up his 28th save in 34 chances, pitching the ninth.	Beltre was one of Hernandez's closest friends when Hernandez first made the jump to the majors and Beltre was with the Mariners. Instead of pitching conservatively, Hernandez went right at Beltre with the 0-2, two-out fastball, and Beltre got him.	"(It's) always, always going to be like that," Hernandez said of the smack talk with his friend. "He got me with his bat today and we'll get another one in Texas."	Hernandez, the reigning AL Cy Young winner gave up nine hits and struck out five but lost his second straight decision. It was also his third loss this season against Texas.	Texas nearly had another homer in the third inning when Ian Kinsler hit a shot down the left-field line. Third base umpire Brian Gorman initially ruled it a two-run homer, but the call was overturned on video review.	Texas added an insurance run in the sixth when Kinsler led off with a single and scored on Elvis Andrus' double down the left-field line. Andrus had three hits and extended his season-high hitting streak to 12 games.	Game notes	 Texas is 12-4 vs. Seattle this season with three games left in Texas next weekend. ... Seattle 3B Chone Figgins will not play again this season with a hip flexor injury, manager Eric Wedge said. ... Seattle will make a detour to Cleveland for a makeup game on Monday. The game was one of two makeups after the Indians and Mariners were rained out on May 14 and 15. Seattle then opens a three-game series in Minnesota on Tuesday. ... LHP Charlie Furbush will start for Seattle against the Indians. He is just 2-6 in eight starts since coming over in late July in a trade with Detroit. ... Sunday was the first time since July 31 most of a Mariners game has been played with the Safeco Field roof closed. It was closed in the top of the first inning on Sunday after closing in the eighth inning of Saturday's game.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

LOS ANGELES -- By the time James Loney discovered what was wrong with his swing it was too late to help the Los Angeles Dodgers contend for a division title.	Still, the six-year veteran first baseman has been making up for lost time in the last four weeks.	Loney had five hits with three RBIs helping lead the Dodgers to a 15-1 rout of the Pittsburgh Pirates on Sunday.	"Every time you face adversity, you've got to pick yourself up and do the best you can," Loney said. "I've learned a lot this year about hitting, and I'm trying to get pitches to hit.	"I just think my timing mechanism has been better. The main thing is being ready to hit and recognizing the pitches better. I just feel more in control and my confidence is a lot better. During the course of the year, you're supposed to hit certain pitches in certain areas, and I wasn't doing that early on. At times maybe I was trying too hard and swinging too hard."	Loney didn't get his average above .250 until June 12, when he had three hits including a home run at Colorado. Since Aug. 21, he is batting .356 with six homers and 24 RBIs and has raised his season average to .283.	"I'm happy for him," teammate Matt Kemp said. "He struggled at the beginning of the season, but we all knew he had this in him. He's got a great swing. He might not hit as many home runs as everybody thinks he should hit, but he's definitely a guy that can hit for average and drive in 100 runs."	Loney recorded his first five-hit game, and Jerry Sands and Juan Rivera each drove in four runs. Sands had a homer among his four hits, leading a 23-hit attack against Brad Lincoln (1-3) and seven relievers who combined to throw 218 pitches.	Kemp had three hits, including his 34th homer, and drove in two runs to increase his career-high total to 113. The Dodgers' run total tied a season high and equaled the most the Pirates have allowed.	"We were challenged dramatically over the weekend. They shut our offense down and they beat us up with the bats," said manager Clint Hurdle, whose staff hasn't had a 1-2-3 inning in the last two games. "We're not playing well, and we're definitely not pitching. We're not getting the length we need out of our starters, which has compounded some things."	After consecutive games in which starters Jeff Locke and James McDonald each pitched three innings and allowed a combined total of eight runs, Lincoln lasted only 1 1/3 innings and was charged with six runs on eight hits -- three of which were sharp singles through the box.	"It was a hit parade today," Kemp said. "It was just one of those days where everybody was seeing the ball, getting good pitches to hit and putting good wood on it."	Chad Billingsley (11-10) allowed a run and four hits over five innings and struck out five. The right-hander, pitching his final home game in the first year of a four-year contract that will pay him more than $41 million, was staked to an 11-0 lead through the first three innings and breezed to his first victory in eight starts since beating Arizona 7-4 on Aug. 5.	"I've been struggling with my arm slot and my mechanics a lot this year and haven't been able to find a good rhythm," Billingsley said. "I had better off-speed stuff today, so I'm just going to keep going with it."	Lincoln, a 26-year-old left-hander, making his seventh start for the Pirates this season, gave up hits to five of his first seven batters and threw 33 pitches in the first as the Dodgers took a 3-0 lead.	Dee Gordon led off with a triple and scored on Jamey Carroll's groundout. Kemp homered to center field on the first pitch, and Sands capped the rally with an RBI single.	The Dodgers increased the margin to 9-0 in the second. Kemp hit a two-out RBI single. Rivera chased Lincoln with another single, and Loney greeted Aaron Thompson with a drive just beyond the reach of center fielder Andrew McCutchen, scoring Kemp and Rivera. Two batters later, Sands hit a first-pitch homer into the left-field pavilion.	Rivera made it 11-0 in the third with a two-run single against Chris Leroux, one of 18 pitchers the Pirates are carrying on their expanded roster. Two more runs scored on a routine flyball by Rivera that fell for a double between center fielder Alex Presley and right fielder Xavier Paul, each of whom thought the other was going to catch it.	The Pirates' run came on Paul's RBI double in the fifth.	The crowd of 37,802 on Fan Appreciation Day increased the Dodgers' season total to 2,832,719 with three home dates left. They would have to sell out all three to reach 3 million with just 719 to spare. The last time the club failed to reach that figure in a non-strike season was 1982. Dodger Stadium has a seating capacity of 56,000, the largest in the majors.	Game notes	 The Dodgers had a season-high 25 hits in Billingsley's 15-0 win at Minnesota on June 27. ... Sunday marked the 34th anniversary of Hurdle's first big league game, when he hit a two-run homer against Glenn Abbott in his second at-bat to help the Royals beat Seattle 8-5 at Kansas City. ... Clayton Kershaw opens the Dodgers' three-game series against San Francisco on Tuesday night at Chavez Ravine, looking for his 20th victory -- and fourth this season against Tim Lincecum. Kershaw will attempt to become the first Dodgers pitcher to go 5-0 against the Giants in the same year since LHP Vic Lombardi did it in 1946.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PHILADELPHIA --  The St. Louis Cardinals are making a playoff push by avoiding looking at the big picture.	Allen Craig hit two homers and drove in three runs, Chris Carpenter gave up eight hits in eight innings, and the Cardinals improved their playoff chances with a 5-0 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Sunday night.	"Common sense is if you allow anything to distract you, then it's going to take away from your best shot," St. Louis manager Tony LaRussa said after the Cardinals pulled within 3 1/2 games of the Atlanta Braves in the NL wild-card chase. "So don't think about anything but the next game we're going to play. We can't control what Atlanta does. But if we don't win a bunch of games, then it's all irrelevant. We're just trying to win the game we play in the series we're playing."	Albert Pujols also homered for the Cardinals (83-69), who have won nine of 11. The Cardinals remained 6 1/2 back of the Milwaukee Brewers in the NL Central.	"We just need to take one day at a time," Pujols said. "We took today's game. Flip the page and hopefully come tomorrow and try to win the series."	St. Louis has 10 games remaining while the Braves (87-66) have nine.	Carpenter (10-9) recorded all but four of his outs by groundballs, and induced three double plays. Only three Phillies reached second and none advanced to third. Carpenter finished with five strikeouts and one walk.	"I was getting ahead in the count, sinking the ball down and away and getting the ball on the ground, which is key for these guys," Carpenter said. "My stuff was good, commanding down in the strike zone on both sides of the plate with my fastball. When you're against guys who want to swing, if you make good pitches, you get early outs."	Chase Utley had three hits for the Phillies (98-53), who rested just two starters a day after clinching their fifth straight NL East title. First baseman Ryan Howard, who is battling a nagging left ankle injury, and catcher Carlos Ruiz didn't start for Philadelphia. Howard is scheduled to have an anti-inflammatory injection in the ankle on Monday.	"Their pitcher pitched good," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said. "He was changing speeds and had a good sinker. The double plays made it difficult to score runs."	Pujols put the Cardinals up 2-0 in the first inning by launching Cole Hamels' first pitch into the second deck in left field. The St. Louis slugger had been just 3 for 20 (.150) off Hamels entering the game.	"Pujols hit a fastball that looked like it was inside, but Pujols is Pujols," Manuel said.	It was the 36th homer for Pujols, who is five RBIs shy of 100 in his quest for his 11th straight season of batting .300 with 30 homers and 100 RBIs. He went 1 for 4 and his averaged dropped a point to .300.	"I've seen it for 11 years," LaRussa said. "It got everybody excited and Hamels got really, really tough, so it's a good thing we got him before everything got working."	St. Louis increased the margin to 4-0 in the sixth on Craig's two-run shot. Craig twice failed in sacrifice bunt attempts, but he made up for it with a long drive to deep left center. Craig's homer was the 17th allowed by Hamels this season, which is the most on the heralded Phillies staff.	Craig added a solo shot to center in the eighth off Joe Blanton.	"He's hit every place he's played," LaRussa said of Craig. "And he's gotten big hits and those are two big ones."	Hamels (14-9) was vying to tie his career high with 15 wins, but two bad pitches did him in. Outside of the homers, the left-hander was solid with nine strikeouts and no walks.	Philadelphia remained four victories shy of setting a franchise record for wins in a season.	Fernando Salas completed the shutout with a scoreless ninth.	Carpenter hopes the Cardinals can continue the momentum.	"You continue to play hard, just like we have all year," he said. "Fortunately, we've been pitching well and hitting well. Some things are going well for us at times and we're pitching and playing well. That's what you have to do.	"We've been playing well and hopefully we can continue it tomorrow and get back home and continue it at home."	Game notes	 Right-hander Justin DeFratus, making his major league debut, pitched a scoreless ninth for the Phillies. Pujols has now reached safely in 34 straight games. St. Louis outfielder Matt Holliday missed his fourth straight game with an inflamed tendon on his right middle finger. The Phillies' crowd of 45,063 was the club's 199th regular-season sellout and 212th straight overall, counting postseason. .. Philadelphia was shut out for just the sixth time this season. ... Cardinals right-hander Kyle Lohse (13-8, 3.62) is scheduled to face right-hander Roy Halladay (18-5, 2.34) at 7:05 Monday night in the finale of the four-game series.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK --  Mariano Rivera stood by himself, in the center of the diamond at Yankee Stadium.	For once, the great closer wasn't sure what to do next.	So he smiled, blew a kiss to the crowd, and then doffed his cap as cheers washed over him following the record 602nd save of his career.	"Oh, my God, for the first time in my career, I'm on the mound alone," Rivera said. "It was priceless. I didn't know it could be like that."	Rivera pitched a perfect ninth inning, striking out Chris Parmelee on what appeared to be his signature cut fastball to end the New York Yankees' 6-4 win over the Minnesota Twins on Monday.	Fans from the smallest crowd in the Stadium's three-year history stood and shouted from Rivera's first pitch to his last as he retired Trevor Plouffe, Michael Cuddyer and Parmelee in order and broke Trevor Hoffman's mark.	They even roared in the bottom of the eighth when Nick Swisher grounded into an inning-ending double play -- and drew a loud cheer from fans who wanted to see history made at the ballpark for the second time this summer. In July, Derek Jeter got his 3,000th hit at home.	"These guys are into it," Rivera thought to himself.	It's a remarkable achievement, considering the slender right-hander throws mostly one pitch. Opposing hitters have seen it for years, but still haven't figured it out.	"It's amazing," Cuddyer said. "You've got a 99 percent chance of knowing what's coming, and he still is able to go out there and dominate."	So good for so long, Rivera has built a Hall of Fame-caliber career and been a pillar of five World Series championship teams. The only person who might not acknowledge Rivera isn't the best closer of all time is Rivera himself.	"You know me, I'm not like that," Rivera said. "I like to be under the radar, do my job."	He nearly did it outside the country. The 41-year-old Rivera tied Hoffman with save No. 601 on Saturday in Toronto. The AL East leaders lost Sunday, putting Rivera in line to get the milestone in the Yankees' last homestand of the season.	Hoffman earned most of his saves with San Diego and retired after pitching last year with Milwaukee.	"I want to congratulate Mariano Rivera on setting the all-time saves record," Hoffman said in a statement. "It's a great accomplishment and he is still going strong! I have tremendous respect for Mariano not just for his on-field accomplishments, but also for his service to the community."	On Monday, the crowd hollered as Rivera came in to his customary of "Enter Sandman." The fans grew louder with every strike, every out as Rivera closed in. He even broke a bat for good measure -- sawing off Parmelee and sending the rookie back to the dugout for another piece of wood.	Parmelee lasted only one more pitch. Plate umpire John Hirschbeck rung him up, and catcher Russell Martin came out to the mound, gently placed the ball in Rivera's glove, and then gave the skinny Panamanian a big hug.	Rivera stayed and accepted congratulations -- Alex Rodriguez, Mark Teixeira and finally Jeter came over to him before the bullpen and bench got there while the Twins watched from their dugout.	"I think it shows what he means to baseball, what he's done," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "I also think it shows the class of the Minnesota Twins."	Eventually, the Twins went back to their lockers and the Yankees did, too. That meant Rivera was left on the mound. He tried to sneak off the field with them, but longtime teammate Jorge Posada pushed him, laughing, onto the mound, where fans cheered him once again.	And who would've thought it, at least back in 1995 when Rivera started out. He began his career as a starter, lasting only 3 1/3 innings and losing 10-0 to the Angels in his debut, before becoming a star in the bullpen.	Rivera's 602 saves have come in 674 chances. Hoffman got his 601 in 677 tries.	Paid attendance was 40,045, less than the capacity crowd and attendant hullabaloo surrounding Jeter's historic hit. STATS LLC said Monday's makeup game drew the fewest fans since the new Yankee Stadium opened.	"Thank God it's over, too. Because I was getting a little uncomfortable," Rivera said.	New York now has another goal before heading to Tampa Bay to close the season: winning the division. The Yankees lead Boston by 5½ games with 10 to play.	The Twins lost their ninth straight, tying a run in May as their worst of the season. The Yankees have been struggling, too -- this was just their fifth win in 12 games.	Rivera has finished their last three victories, though. He earned his 600th save in Seattle on Sept. 13.	Now that the milestone is behind him, Rivera can focus on getting ready for his 16th October in 17 seasons -- that's when he really made his reputation. Those 602 saves don't count any of the 42 wins -- in 47 chances -- he locked down in the playoffs.	A.J. Burnett didn't make it past the fifth inning, but Cory Wade (6-1), Boone Logan, Rafael Soriano and David Robertson kept the Twins at bay until Rivera came on in the ninth, and Curtis Granderson hit his 41st homer of the year.	Granderson's homer off Scott Diamond (1-5) came in the first after Jeter reached on an infield single and Robinson Cano hit an RBI triple in the third followed by Swisher's single to make it 5-0. Rodriguez hit a two-out RBI single in the sixth -- right around the time Rivera was realizing he could be called on in the ninth.	As he has been since he got his first save on May 17, 1996, Mo was ready in the ninth. The only thing he wasn't quite set for was the spotlight.	"Don't get me wrong, it feels good," Rivera said. "The reception was wonderful. I could not ask for anything more than that."	Game notes	 Of Rivera's 602 saves, this was the 208th of a single 1-2-3 inning, according to STATS LLC. ... This was Rivera's 177th save to end with a strikeout, STATS said. ... Just five pitchers who were primarily relievers are in the Hall of Fame: Hoyt Wilhelm (1985), Rollie Fingers (1992), Dennis Eckersley (2004), Bruce Sutter (2006) and Goose Gossage (2008). ... Ben Revere set a Twins record for rookies by stealing his 32nd base in the third inning. Luis Rivas swiped 31 in 2001. ... Minnesota will return home for three games against the Mariners, where they would start Liam Hendricks (0-2) against Seattle's Jason Vargas (8-13). ... New York began an eight-game homestand. They were set to play four against Tampa Bay starting Tuesday, with Ivan Nova (10-9) against Wade Davis (10-9).	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

BOSTON --  Dustin Pedroia was trying to be the face of confidence standing in the middle of a very quiet Red Sox clubhouse.	"We've got the lead. We've just got to go out and play better. We're not hanging our heads," he said after fading Boston lost for the 12th time in 15 games, dropping the opener of a day-night doubleheader 6-5 to the Baltimore Orioles on Monday.	Jeremy Guthrie (9-17) pitched the last-place Orioles to the win, cutting Boston's once-large AL wild-card lead to 1½ games over charging Tampa Bay.	Boston rallied from a 6-2 deficit and cut the lead to two when a missed call cost the Red Sox a run and halted their comeback bid.	TV replays appeared to show that David Ortiz's fifth-inning liner down the right-field line -- ruled foul by first-base umpire Mike Estabrook -- seemed to carom fair off the lower part of a short wall near the Pesky Pole with Pedroia on third after an RBI triple.	"That's the breaks of the game," Pedroia said. "We've played a hundred-something games. We're not going to say the season's over because an umpire missed a call."	Boston, which lost three of four games against Tampa Bay this past weekend, led the Rays by nine on Sept 3. The Red Sox have dropped 15 of 20 since they held a 1½-game edge over New York atop the AL East on Aug. 30.	The Yankees now lead the division by 5½ games.	"Any loss hurts," Boston manager Terry Francona said. "We battled, and battled and battled and came up short. I'm glad we're playing again right away."	The Red Sox have six games remaining against Baltimore and three in New York against the Yankees. The Rays have 10 to play.	Robert Andino hit a two-run homer and Nolan Reimold followed with his 12th, putting the Orioles ahead 5-1 in the fourth. J.J. Hardy led off the fifth with his career-high 28th home run.	Baltimore won for the first time in six games at Fenway Park this year, getting outscored 40-20 in the five loses.	"These are some pressure games. I want to see those guys in those situations," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. "Hopefully down the road they'll be pitching in games that mean a little bit more for us."	Guthrie pitched into the seventh inning for his first career win in Fenway Park. He had been 0-3 and the Orioles had lost all seven of his previous starts.	Marco Scutaro went 3-for-3 and scored twice for Boston. Darnell McDonald hit a solo homer for the Red Sox.	Guthrie was pulled after McDonald's leadoff single in the seventh. He allowed four runs and 10 hits.	"It's really nice," Guthrie said. "Probably one of my favorite days as a baseball player."	Jim Johnson, the sixth Orioles pitcher, worked a perfect ninth for his seventh save.	Leading 2-1 in the fourth, Baltimore roughed up Kyle Weiland (0-3) when Andino and Reimold hit consecutive homers into the Green Monster seats.	The Red Sox trailed 6-2 in the fifth before they mounted a comeback.	Adrian Gonzalez had an RBI double and Pedroia followed with a triple off the center-field wall, cutting it to 6-4 against Guthrie, before Ortiz's drive was ruled foul.	"It's huge," Red Sox catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia said. "Like I said, the game's about momentum."	After the umpires huddled in the middle of the diamond, the call was upheld. Francona argued along with Ortiz and first base coach Ron Johnson. Ortiz then flied to the track in center, pounding his helmet to the ground in frustration.	"I wish they could have kept asking somebody else, but they ran out of people to ask," Francona said.	The Orioles took a 2-0 lead in the third when McDonald, inserted into the lineup when left fielder Carl Crawford was scratched with a stiff neck, lost Reimold's fly ball in the sun. The ball ticked off his glove for a single, and McDonald then dropped Josh Bell's for a two-base error before Matt Angle hit a two-run double over his leaping try against the wall.	McDonald, who came up to spattering of boos leading off in the bottom of the inning, homered into the Monster seats.	Weiland, making his fourth career start and his third against the Orioles, lasted just 4 2/3 innings, allowing six runs and five hits.	Game notes	 Showalter said he wasn't ready to put INF Mark Reynolds back in the lineup after he missed Sunday's game. Reynolds was hit in the helmet by a pitch on Saturday. "I'm not in a position where we feel comfortable running him out there. We'll see what (Tuesday) brings," he said. ... Francona said OF J.D. Drew may see a doctor soon to check the "stability" of a broken middle finger and if all is well they may "move forward a little bit" toward his return. Drew has been sidelined since July 20 with a left shoulder injury and broke his finger on a rehab assignment. ... Francona also said RHP Dan Wheeler has been bothered by forearm stiffness. ... Showalter, critical in a magazine article during spring training of Red Sox GM Theo Epstein's ability to use a large payroll, wouldn't say if beating the Red Sox meant more now. "You don't ever think about that," he said. "We're just trying to take care of our business. I'd like to be in their shoes. We're trying one day to figure out how to be as good as they are." ... It was a makeup of a May 17 rainout. ... John Lackey (12-12, 6.19 ERA) goes for Boston against struggling lefty Brian Matusz (1-7, 9.84 ERA) in the nightcap.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CLEVELAND --  Mike Carp and the Seattle Mariners made the most of their cross-country trip for a makeup game.	Carp hit a grand slam into the second deck in right field and drove in five runs during Seattle's nine-run third inning, leading the Mariners to a rain-shortened 12-6 victory over the Cleveland Indians on Monday.	"It was worth it, to come back from a deficit, get a big inning and get a nice win," Carp said.	The Mariners came in to make up a rainout from May 15, and played in a steady drizzle before the field was covered at the start of the eighth. After waiting 44 minutes, it was called.	"It's very unusual," Mariners manager Eric Wedge said. "Everybody has to do it from time to time. It's a quick in and out. The geography works OK for us since we head to Minnesota from here, so it's not horrible. It's big league baseball. They want everyone to play 162 (games). I respect that. I get that."	Carp drove Chad Durbin's 1-1 pitch 455 feet to right to put Seattle ahead 11-4. He doubled home the first run in the inning off David Huff (2-6).	"Last time I faced him (Durbin) in the same situation, bases loaded, he struck me out," Carp said. "This time, I looked for a fastball inside. He threw a cutter and I put a good swing on it."	Cleveland took a 3-0 lead in the first against Charlie Furbush (4-9). Asdrubal Cabrera hit a two-run homer and Carlos Santana followed with his fifth homer in eight games.	"I thought I made some good pitches, but they came out swinging," Furbush said.	Furbush allowed six runs and 10 hits over five innings, but managed to snap a personal five-game losing streak. The left-hander struck out a career-high eight, including six in a row from the third through fifth.	"I just tried to throw my fastball in and out while keeping it in the zone," Furbush said of making an adjustment after falling behind. "I mixed in some pretty good sliders. It helped to get the big lead."	The Mariners' third was their biggest inning of the season, surpassing a six-run outburst April 27 at Detroit.	Alex Liddi hit a two-run homer in the second for Seattle, which snapped Cleveland's three-game winning streak with its sixth win in its last 18 games. Liddi's homer was the majors' first by a player born in Italy since Detroit's Reno Bertoia on Aug. 31, 1961.	"It is the one I will always remember," Liddi said.	Cabrera doubled home Jason Donald for a 4-2 lead in the bottom half.	The Mariners responded in a big way in the third, taking advantage when Luis Rodriguez's leadoff grounder glanced off third baseman Lonnie Chisenhall's glove for an error. Carp followed with an RBI double and scored on a one-out single by Kyle Seager to tie it at 4. Trayvon Robinson delivered a two-run single and Ichiro Suzuki's RBI double to left made it 7-4 and finished Huff.	Huff made 80 pitches in just 2 2/3 innings, allowing seven hits and nine runs -- five earned. The left-hander has lost four straight starts, compiling a 7.11 ERA during the slide.	"I was down (in the strike zone) and they got some lucky hits in there, little bloop singles," Huff said. "All in all, it was really frustrating, I'm really disappointed in myself."	Manager Manny Acta was more upset.	"We gave David some runs to work with," Acta said. "Unfortunately, he had a very rough day. It was deflating. It kind of sucked the energy out of us after we put up those runs in the first two innings and not being able to hold the lead."	Travis Hafner's two-run single got Cleveland to 11-6 in the fifth, but Wily Mo Pena, who had walked his first three times up, singled home a run in the Mariners' sixth to make it 12-6.

PHILADELPHIA --  The celebration in the St. Louis clubhouse showed just how excited the surging Cardinals are to be in the thick of the playoff chase.	Kyle Lohse outpitched Roy Halladay, and St. Louis held off the Philadelphia Phillies 4-3 on Monday night to gain ground on Atlanta in the NL wild-card race.	Lance Berkman homered and had an RBI single for the Cardinals, who moved within 2½ games of the wild card-leading Braves.	Moments after Octavio Dotel closed out the Cardinals' victory, Atlanta lost 6-5 at Florida on Omar Infante's two-run homer off Craig Kimbrel with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning. The Cardinals, who were watching the game on television, burst into loud cheers that reverberated around the clubhouse.	"To win our game we're already pretty happy, and to see that, that was big," Lohse said.	Cardinals manager Tony La Russa, who was tuned to the Rams-Giants NFL game in his office, smiled when he heard the news.	"This is what the pennant race is all about," La Russa said. "This is what you try to sell in spring training. This is the fun of it. It's part of the fun of being in contention in September."	St. Louis, which took three of four in the series, has won 10 of 12 overall.	Despite the loss, the NL East champion Phillies clinched home-field advantage throughout the postseason when Milwaukee lost to the Chicago Cubs 5-2.	Lohse (14-8) tossed 7 1/3 strong innings, allowing an unearned run and seven hits while striking out five and walking one.	"I thought Lohse was outstanding," La Russa said. "You just can't give him enough credit. We had our best defensive team out there and we kicked it around. He picked everybody up all day."	The Cardinals, who made a pair of errors, have nine games remaining and return to St. Louis for a six-game homestand that begins Tuesday against the Mets.	Atlanta has eight games left, including the final three against the Phillies in Atlanta.	"We've had our backs up against the wall for a long time now," Lohse said. "Every series has been tough. We knew coming in here was going to be really tough. To take three out of four was huge. We've just got to keep it going."	The Phillies scored a pair of runs in the ninth off reliever Jason Motte. Carlos Ruiz doubled with one out and scored on Jimmy Rollins' triple. Rollins scored on Shane Victorino's groundout.	Arthur Rhodes relieved Motte and gave up a two-out single to Chase Utley. Dotel followed and retired Hunter Pence to earn his second save with the Cardinals. He also had one for Toronto this year.	The Phillies lost their second straight since clinching their fifth consecutive NL East title on Saturday. Philadelphia played most of its regulars, with only Ryan Howard getting the day off after receiving an anti-inflammatory injection in his left ankle. Howard is expected to miss a couple of days.	The Phillies (98-54) remained four victories shy of setting a franchise record for wins in a season.	"We came out a little flat, but that's not going to last," manager Charlie Manuel said. "We'll be ready."	Phillies hitters have been in a bit of a lull lately. Philadelphia has scored three runs or fewer in 10 of its last 11 games, averaging 2.5 runs while going 5-6.	"I'm looking for our offense to pick up," Manuel said. "We've got to start scoring some runs before we go into the playoffs."	Halladay (18-6) had won seven straight September decisions and was 9-0 with a 1.97 ERA in his last 10 September starts dating to 2009. But he failed in his bid for his 19th victory and 40th over the last two seasons, which would've marked the first time a Philadelphia pitcher accomplished that since Steve Carlton won 42 games combined in 1979-80.	Halladay tossed eight innings and allowed four runs on six hits with six strikeouts and a season-high four walks (two intentional).	"Hopefully we'll get things going and finish on the right foot," Halladay said. "We've won all year and there's no doubt we'll continue that. There's no cause for concern. Naturally there's a little lull after you clinch."	Berkman's solo homer and Nick Punto's RBI groundout in the first helped the Cardinals take a 2-0 lead. It was Berkman's 31st homer, but first since Aug. 26.	The Phillies got a run back in the second on Ruiz's single.	St. Louis regained a two-run lead in the third when Lohse, after hitting his second double of the season to lead off the inning, scored on Berkman's two-out single.	Philadelphia had a chance for a big inning in the bottom half, loading the bases with one out on a pair of singles and an error, but Lohse struck out Raul Ibanez and Placido Polanco to end the threat.	Albert Pujols' two-out double to left in the seventh drove in Punto and gave the Cardinals a 4-1 lead. The slugger, who had been 1 for 10 against Halladay, has reached safely in 35 straight games.	Philadelphia lost a four-game series for the first time this season after winning its previous eight. The Phillies have scored three runs or fewer in 10 of their last 11 games, averaging 2.5 runs while going 5-6.	Rafael Furcal went 3 for 4 with two doubles for St. Louis.	Game notes	 Rollins' triple gave him 100 for his career. ... Berkman is 11 for 24 (.458) in his last seven games. ... The crowd of 45,048 was the 200th straight regular-season sellout and 213th overall, counting postseason games. ... Cardinals outfielder Matt Holliday missed his fifth straight game with an inflamed tendon on his right middle finger.

TORONTO --  After two costly mistakes, the Los Angeles Angels needed a perfect play to save the game. For once, their typically sparkling defense wasn't up to the task.	Adam Lind drove in the winning run with a grounder in the 10th inning and the Blue Jays beat the Angels 3-2 on Monday night before a small crowd in Toronto.	Two errors led to three unearned runs and extra infielder Torii Hunter couldn't cut down the winning run at the plate as the Blue Jays improved to 10-0 at home in extra innings.	"There were some things on the defensive side that definitely swung the momentum of the game," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.	Hunter and Mark Trumbo homered for the Angels but Los Angeles lost for the third time in four games, further denting its chances of reaching the playoffs. The Angels trail first-place Texas by five games in the AL West and are behind both Boston and Tampa Bay in the wild-card race.	"We'd better step our game up if we want it," Hunter said.	The Angels wrap up their road schedule with three more in Toronto before going home Friday. Oakland visits for three over the weekend and the season ends with a three-game series against the first-place Rangers starting next Monday.	"All is not lost," Hunter said. "We just need to be within three come Monday."	The crowd of 11,178 was Toronto's second-smallest of the season, and well short of the 18,556 who showed up just down the street to watch the NHL's Toronto Maple Leafs open their preseason schedule against the Ottawa Senators.	The Blue Jays drew a season-low 11,077 fans for an April 5 game against Oakland.	Mike McCoy reached on shortstop Erick Aybar's error to begin the bottom of the 10th and Eric Thames followed with a single to center off left-hander Scott Downs (6-3).	After Thames was forced at second on Jose Bautista's fielder's choice, Scioscia brought in Hunter from right field to serve as an extra infielder. Lind hit a grounder that Hunter fielded between first and second but his throw to the plate was low and wide, allowing McCoy to slide in safely.	"They got me to roll it over, but I hit it to someone used to being 300 feet away, not 90 feet," Lind said. "I know he's got a lot of Gold Gloves, but they were as an outfielder. I guess I hit it to the right area."	Hunter, who has been brought into the infield before, said he had almost no margin for error on the pivotal throw.	"Tough play, man," a frustrated Hunter said. "My momentum was carrying me to my left. I had everything going on. The base runner was in my way, Trumbo got in my way and my momentum just wouldn't let me set my feet.	"It had to be right there, it had to be perfect," Hunter added.	Hunter threw out Thames at second base in the fifth, his career-best 15th outfield assist.	Casey Janssen (6-0) pitched around a leadoff double in the 10th to earn the win.	Hunter led off the second with a homer to center, his 21st, but Toronto answered with two runs in the fourth.	Angels right-hander Jerome Williams walked Edwin Encarnacion to begin the inning, and Kelly Johnson followed with a bouncer to the mound. Williams made a barehanded grab but threw wildly to second, allowing Encarnacion to advance on the error.	"He just rushed the throw to second," Scioscia said. "You really just need to set your feet for the play at second and get an out on that ball."	Brett Lawrie walked to load the bases before Colby Rasmus grounded into a double play, but J.P. Arencibia followed with a two-run single to right.	The Angels tied it in the fifth when Trumbo led off with his 28th homer.	Making his fifth start of the season, Williams allowed two runs -- none earned -- in 6 1/3 innings. He walked three and struck out three.	Hisanori Takahashi pitched one inning of relief, but was replaced by Bobby Cassevah after Thames drew a one-out walk in the eighth. Bautista grounded into a fielder's choice, with second baseman Howie Kendrick making a fine play to get Thames at second, and Lind grounded out to end the inning.	Toronto starter Ricky Romero matched a career-high by working nine innings. The left-hander allowed two runs and six hits, walked none and struck out five.	Twenty of the 27 outs recorded by Romero came on ground balls.	"They came out swinging and it worked to my advantage because that sinker was working today and they kept pounding it into the ground," Romero said.	Game notes	 Los Angeles is 8-12 in extra innings. ... Angels rookie OF Mike Trout (sore left calf) did not start. ... Blue Jays SS Yunel Escobar (left elbow) missed his seventh straight game. Escobar, who played catch and ran on the field before the game, has not played since being hit by a pitch from Baltimore's Rick VandenHurk on Sept. 10. ... Thames started for Toronto one day after being cut on the right eyelid by a foul tip.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.
