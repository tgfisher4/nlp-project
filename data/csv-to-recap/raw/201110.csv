ARLINGTON, Texas --  The Detroit Tigers certainly had their chances in Game 2 of the AL Championship Series.	Two on and none out in the first inning, middle of the order coming up. Bases loaded in the second and ninth. A runner on second base with one out in the 10th. A man on for AL batting champion Miguel Cabrera in the 11th.	Detroit couldn't manage a single run in any of those situations, failures that loomed large once Ryan Perry served up a game-ending grand slam to Nelson Cruz in the 11th inning, giving the Texas Rangers a 7-3 victory Monday and sending the Tigers home trailing 0-2 in the best-of-seven ALCS.	"We didn't quite get it done," Detroit manager Jim Leyland said. "We haven't been able to come up with any big hits. That's really hard. We've had some opportunities, but up to this point, we just haven't been able to do that."	After leaving nine runners on base in the opener, the Tigers stranded 13 this time. The five they wasted in the first two innings were as painful as the five they left in the last three innings.	"They made every pitch when they needed it," Cabrera said.	Another stat that's tough for Detroit to swallow: 1 for 12 with runners in scoring position in Game 2. The lone exception was Ryan Raburn's three-run homer in the third inning.	"It's just been two close games and could have gone either way," said cleanup hitter Victor Martinez, who went 0 for 4 and is 0 for 7 in the series. "Unfortunately, we end up on the losing side, but ... we're going home. We've been doing it the whole season: turn the page, come back tomorrow and keep on going."	Leyland insists his club is fine, especially headed to Detroit. After all, if the Tigers keep getting this many chances to score, the lineup is bound to start coming through.	Still, they're running out of time.	Only three teams have overcome 0-2 deficits in the LCS since it became a seven-game series in 1985: the Royals and Cardinals, both in '85, and the 2004 Red Sox, who famously clawed from an 0-3 hole to become World Series champions.	"They've got to win two more. We have to win four. It's that simple," Leyland said.	Doug Fister, who won the first-round finale at Yankee Stadium, pitches for Detroit in Game 3. Colby Lewis starts for Texas.	"We ain't got much to lose right now," said Raburn, who is 2 for 6 with four walks in the series. "We're down 2-0, so we're going to come out and play hard. We've got a great team. It's going to be another battle again. Just come out and play hard and see what happens."	Martinez and leadoff hitter Austin Jackson each went 0 for 4 on Monday. But pretty much everyone had a chance to get the big hit.	After Jackson opened the game with a walk and Ramon Santiago singled, Delmon Young, Cabrera and Martinez were retired, ruining that early chance to jump on Texas' shaky starter, Derek Holland. The failure hurt right away as the Rangers got a pair of runs off Max Scherzer in the bottom of the first.	Detroit was poised to get to Holland again in the second inning, filling the bases with two outs for Santiago. He hit a grounder that nearly made it into center field, but Texas second baseman Ian Kinsler stopped the ball and flipped it to shortstop Elvis Andrus to narrowly get the force out at second base.	Raburn's homer in the third put the Tigers ahead for the first time all series, but they couldn't push another run across against a series of Texas relievers. The Rangers' bullpen threw 8 1/3 shutout innings, with Scott Feldman settling things down for the first 4 1/3 and Mike Adams going the final inning for the win.	Texas relievers have combined for 12 2/3 scoreless innings during the first two games of the series, allowing five hits and three walks while striking out 16.	"With these pitching staffs, runs are hard to come by usually," said Andy Dirks, a late-inning replacement who went 0 for 2 and let a fly ball tick off the end of his glove in right field just before Cruz's winning slam. "You've just got to keep battling every at-bat. Sometimes you're going to produce a run here or there and they're all big. You've just got to keep fighting."	Detroit's best chance against the Rangers' bullpen came in the ninth. With two outs, Santiago singled and Don Kelly doubled to the right-field wall. The Tigers could have gambled and gone for the go-ahead run, but third-base coach Gene Lamont held up Santiago.	"The ball came back to him (Cruz, the right fielder)," Leyland said. "That's kind of the luck of the draw."	Texas went to closer Neftali Feliz and had him intentionally walk Cabrera, loading the bases for Martinez. He hit a flare into shallow center field that Andrus juggled, pinning the ball against his chest to end the threat.	"It's just one of those breaks," said Raburn, who was watching from the on-deck circle. "When you're winning, that stuff gets caught, and when you're not ..."	Detroit closer Jose Valverde made things interesting by loading the bases with none out in the bottom of the ninth, but got out of it with a shallow fly ball and a nifty 3-2-3 double play started and finished by Cabrera, who isn't always the slickest fielder at first base.	Raburn led off the 10th with a walk and moved to second on a sacrifice. He never got any farther, though.	In what proved to be Detroit's final at-bat in the 11th, Kelly singled and Cabrera sent a ball high and deep toward the Texas bullpen in right-center. Josh Hamilton kept drifting back and caught it on the warning track.	"It was an exciting game, you know?" Dirks said. "It was just fun -- except for the outcome."	Game notes	 Detroit C Alex Avila was 1 for 22 this postseason before a single in the sixth. He was retired twice more after that. ... Valverde went two innings, marking the first time this year he's gone more than one. ... Detroit fell to 4-3-1 in extra-inning postseason games. Yes, a tie. It came in the Tigers' first postseason game, the opener of the 1907 World Series, when Ty Cobb and the Tigers tied the Cubs 3-3 in 12 innings in a game called because of darkness. ... The Tigers hadn't gone to extra innings in a postseason game since Game 2 of the 1984 ALCS, when they beat the Royals 5-3 in 11 innings. This was their 31st postseason game since then.

MILWAUKEE --  Leave "Beast Mode" to the guys on the other team. Albert Pujols was just a monster.	The St. Louis slugger had one of the biggest postseason nights of his career in Game 2 of the NL Championship Series, going 4 for 5 with a home run, three doubles and five RBIs to lead the Cardinals past the Milwaukee Brewers 12-3 on Monday.	Pujols belted a two-run homer in the first, a two-run double in the third and an RBI double in the fifth, then added another double in the seventh. The crowd cheered sarcastically when the Brewers finally retired him in the eighth.	"Sometimes when they come, they come in a bunch," Pujols said.	His big hits came one night after Ryan Braun and Prince Fielder bashed the Brewers to a 9-6, come-from-behind victory in Game 1.	This time, the big bats couldn't bring Milwaukee back -- even at Miller Park. Milwaukee was the best home team in the majors all season and the Brewers had won all four home games in the playoffs until Monday.	The Cardinals' commanding victory temporarily silenced the boisterous Brewers and their trademark "Beast Mode" celebration gesture.	"It wasn't joyful," Fielder said. "You've just got to deal with it and move on."	The series now shifts to St. Louis, where Cardinals ace Chris Carpenter faces Brewers right-hander Yovani Gallardo in Game 3 on Wednesday night.	"Our attitude was we've got to win a game to make it a series," St. Louis manager Tony La Russa said.	Pujols can become a free agent after the World Series, so a big postseason could raise his price. The three-time NL MVP was 1 for 4 in Sunday night's loss, hitting into a double play with runners on first and third in the seventh inning. A run scored on the play, but it seemed to be an indication that Pujols wasn't quite on his game. He came into Monday with only one RBI in the Cardinals' first six postseason games.	"You learn from the mistakes that you made," Pujols said. "Yesterday was just so tough. Going to bed, I was just thinking about some of the opportunities I had to help our ballclub win. I turned that page, knowing today was a new day."	Brewers manager Ron Roenicke, of course, has seen such things from Pujols before.	"The last time we saw them at their place he was swinging the bat just like this," Roenicke said. "You can't make mistakes to him. You have to hit spots. You have to keep it down in the zone. He doesn't miss too many mistakes."	Rickie Weeks hit a two-run homer in the fourth for Milwaukee, then was involved in a disputed play in the fifth. With the bases loaded and one out, Weeks grounded into a double play, though replays showed he was safe.	Weeks -- hobbled by the lingering effects of a midseason left ankle injury -- appeared to beat the throw to first base and seemed upset when he was called out.	"Big part in the game, whether he's safe or out," Roenicke said. "You guys saw the replay. That was a big play."	But it didn't matter much after the Brewers gave up four runs in a backbreaking seventh inning. Fielder homered in the eighth, well after the outcome had been decided.	Cardinals starter Edwin Jackson went 4 1/3 innings, giving up Weeks' home run. Lance Lynn got the win.	It was a short and ugly start by Milwaukee's Shaun Marcum, who gave up five runs on seven hits in four innings and took the loss. Marcum, obtained in an offseason trade with Toronto, struggled mightily in the final month of the season. After a rough outing in Game 3 of the NL Division Series against Arizona, his place in the Brewers' postseason rotation might come into question.	"We'll see how it goes," Roenicke said, adding later: "As far as I'm concerned right now he's pitching again."	St. Louis got started early when Jon Jay bunted for a one-out hit in the first. Pujols came to the plate and delivered what amounted to a warning shot, hitting a long fly just foul. Then he zeroed in on Marcum's offering, smacking it to left field for a home run.	Pujols stood at the plate and admired his shot for a moment, flipped his bat away and trotted around the bases.	"He's a great offensive player. He's a heads-up defensive player. He's a heads-up baserunner. This is a great baseball player," Roenicke said.	St. Louis added two more runs in the third. Jackson's single fell in when center fielder Nyjer Morgan got a bad break on the ball, tried to make a diving catch and then dropped it. With one out, Jay sneaked a single down the third-base line, again setting the stage for Pujols.	Pujols hammered a pitch deep to center, Morgan missed a chance at what would have been an acrobatic catch, and two runs scored to give the Cardinals a 4-0 lead. Pujols pointed to the sky upon arriving at second base, then clapped his hands.	"Heck, you know at some point he's going to assert himself," teammate Lance Berkman said. "Certainly tonight that was the case. He got some good pitches to hit and he crushed them."	The Cardinals added another run in the fourth. Yadier Molina doubled, advanced on a groundout and scored when Nick Punto dribbled a single up the middle with the infield in to give St. Louis a 5-0 lead.	Milwaukee finally got to Jackson in the fourth, when Fielder led off with a double and Weeks hit a two-run shot to left to cut the Cardinals' lead to 5-2. A one-out single by Yuniesky Betancourt threatened to keep the rally going, but Jonathan Lucroy grounded into a forceout and Casey McGehee tapped back to the pitcher to end the inning.	Brewers reliever Marco Estrada took over in the fifth, but the Cardinals kept on swinging.	Jay led off with a double and Pujols laced a ball into the gap in right-center for an RBI double. Pujols advanced to third on a groundout, then scored when a ball slipped through Lucroy's legs for a wild pitch. Lucroy found the ball and made a quick throw to Estrada at the plate, but it wasn't in time.	"The bullpen didn't do so well, either," Roenicke said. "We didn't pitch well today."	Game notes	Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers attended the game, getting a huge cheer from the crowd when he was shown on the stadium video board in the middle of the second inning. Rodgers has developed a friendship with Braun. ... A foul popup dropped between Pujols and Molina in the second inning, leaving them staring blankly at each other. ... Attendance was 43,937.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DETROIT --  Doug Fister shook off a frustrating first inning and Victor Martinez hurt himself while hitting a tying home run.	The banged-up Detroit Tigers are teetering but still standing, and now they have a chance to even the AL Championship Series.	Fister delivered another strong start in a game Detroit needed and Miguel Cabrera homered and hit a tiebreaking double to lead the Tigers past the Texas Rangers 5-2 Tuesday night in Game 3.	"In and out, moving the ball around, moving the ball both sides of the plate," Detroit manager Jim Leyland said. "I thought it was a pitching clinic."	Detroit dropped the first two games in Texas before turning to Fister, who won the decisive fifth game of the division series at Yankee Stadium last week. He was sharp again, allowing two runs and seven hits with no walks in 7 1/3 innings.	Martinez homered in the fourth to tie the score at 1, then stayed in the game after an injury to his ribcage.	"You know what? This is us," Leyland said. "We are what we are. We've been doing this for the whole year, and we're going to either win this thing or go down with what we got."	Jose Valverde, after tossing a season-high two innings the day before, worked around a leadoff double in the ninth for his third playoff save. He got some help from Cabrera, who made a diving play at first base.	Game 4 is Wednesday afternoon. Matt Harrison starts for Texas against Rick Porcello -- both went 14-9 this season.	"It's going to be a long series," Cabrera said. "Nobody (said) it's going to be easy. You've got to be patient."	Rangers third baseman Adrian Beltre fouled a ball off his left knee in the fourth and hobbled the rest of the night. X-rays were negative and he has a bruise.	Texas manager Ron Washington said the team would know more Wednesday.	Cabrera's double in the fifth put the Tigers ahead 2-1 and he added a towering solo homer in the seventh.	Jhonny Peralta also went deep for the Tigers. Austin Jackson broke out of his postseason slump with three hits, including an RBI single.	Texas right-hander Colby Lewis, who entered 4-0 in five postseason starts, allowed four runs and eight hits in 5 2/3 innings. He struck out six and walked two.	"He throws strikes and every now and then he's going to give up some long balls. I thought it was a pretty good ballgame," Washington said. "He kept us in the ballgame. It was Fister that did the job out there tonight."	Stung by Nelson Cruz's game-ending grand slam Monday, the Tigers returned home hoping to shake out of their offensive funk. They fell behind 1-0 when Fister allowed three consecutive singles to start the game, but the 6-foot-8 right-hander held the Rangers in check after that, even striking out Cruz to end the seventh as the towel-waving crowd at Comerica Park roared its approval.	After leaving 22 runners on base in the first two games, the Tigers struggled again early on against Lewis. Detroit had two on with one out in the second, but Alex Avila and Ryan Raburn both struck out.	Lewis struck out five in the first three innings, but Martinez led off the fourth with a homer to right to tie it at 1.	Martinez, who hit .330 this season despite groin, knee and back problems, appeared to hurt himself on his home run swing, laboring slowly around the bases after the ball cleared the fence. When he returned to the dugout, his head still down, he slammed his helmet down as he descended the steps toward the clubhouse.	"The only way I won't play tomorrow is if I wake up and I'm dead," Martinez said after the game.	Detroit was already playing without injured outfielders Delmon Young, Magglio Ordonez and Brennan Boesch, and it wasn't clear whether Martinez -- the designated hitter -- would be able to continue. But he was back in the fifth, standing near the on-deck circle with Cabrera at the plate.	With runners at first and third and two outs, Texas decided to pitch to Cabrera, and his line drive down the right-field line on an 0-2 count stayed fair for a double to drive in a run.	"I'm not going to take another runner and put him at second base. The winning run is already at third base," Washington said. "We tried to make a pitch. Colby didn't get it there. Cabrera caught it."	Martinez drew a walk, loading the bases for Don Kelly, who hit a check-swing grounder to third. Beltre fielded the ball, then paused and waited to tag Cabrera. When the Detroit baserunner froze in his tracks, Beltre finally backpedaled toward the bag for the force to end the inning.	Detroit added two runs in the sixth. Peralta led off with a homer, and Jackson's RBI single made it 4-1. It was an encouraging night for Jackson, who entered 3 for 25 in the postseason with 14 strikeouts.	Cabrera's homer in the seventh, which stayed fair down the left-field line, was his second of the playoffs and came on an 0-2 pitch.	Detroit provided more than enough offense for Fister, who was terrific down the stretch after the Tigers acquired him in a trade with Seattle shortly before the July 31 deadline. He retired his final batter Tuesday on an unusual unassisted putout, fielding Endy Chavez's grounder and then hustling over to first because Cabrera was well off the bag, trying to position himself for a potential play on the ball.	Fister was lifted after that, and he tipped his cap to an appreciative crowd as he left the field.	"Using the defense was a key thing for me and just focusing in on hey, I'm not trying to blow it by these guys," Fister said. "I'm not trying to get strikeouts. I'm looking for contact and let's go deep in the game."	Fister's first nine pitches were strikes, but the Rangers poked three of them into the outfield for singles and took a 1-0 lead. Ian Kinsler led off with a single to left, then Elvis Andrus chopped an 0-2 pitch into right for a base hit.	Josh Hamilton fell behind 0-2 as well before hitting a soft line drive just past the outstretched arm of Peralta, the shortstop, for an RBI single.	Fister escaped without further damage thanks to a double-play grounder by Michael Young and a strikeout by Beltre.	"Just stick with the same game plan," Fister said. "They hit a few groundballs that made it through the holes, and good hitters do. They came out firing and Alex and I just stuck with the game plan and used our defense. Tremendous plays out there, and you know that's the name of the game."	Game notes	 Valverde has converted all 52 of his save chances this year, including the postseason. ... Fister was nearly hit in the fourth when a piece of Mike Napoli's broken bat sailed toward the mound. The right-hander instinctively stuck out his glove, but the bat missed him. ... Hamilton lost control of his bat during a sixth-inning swing, and it sailed into the front row behind the Texas dugout. A male fan was shaken up after getting hit by the bat but appeared to be OK. ... Yorvit Torrealba started at catcher for Texas so Napoli could have a bit of a breather as the DH. Torrealba had three hits.	Information from The Associated Press contributed to this report.

DETROIT --  The Texas tag team of Nelson Cruz and Mike Napoli was too much for the Detroit Tigers.	Cruz made a rocket throw to keep the score tied, then hit a crushing three-run homer in the 11th inning off Jose Valverde that helped send the Rangers over the Tigers 7-3 Wednesday night for a 3-1 lead in the AL championship series. Napoli had put Texas ahead with an RBI single earlier in the 11th.	Cruz, whose grand slam in the 11th inning won Game 2, once again starred for the Rangers in a game delayed at the start for more than two hours by rain.	With Detroit runners at the corners in the eighth and the score 3-all, Cruz caught Delmon Young's flyball to right field and made a strong peg to Napoli, the catcher, to nail Miguel Cabrera.	"For you guys that haven't seen Nelson every day, he's capable of doing exactly what he's doing," Texas manager Ron Washington said. "We've been waiting for it for a long time, and as I always say, I don't judge Nelson just because he hits balls out of the ballpark. He's a complete player. He takes pride in every part of the game."	Napoli blooped a go-ahead single in the 11th and Cruz soon added his fourth home run of the ALCS. Cruz became the first player in major league history to hit a pair of extra-inning homers in the same postseason series.	Texas tries for its second consecutive AL pennant on Thursday, sending C.J. Wilson to the mound to face Detroit ace Justin Verlander.	The ALCS has marked quite a turnaround for Cruz. After going just 1 for 15 in the first-round playoff win over Tampa Bay, he's 5 for 14 with nine RBIs in only four games against the Tigers -- and seven of those RBIs have come in the 11th inning alone.	Brandon Inge hit a solo home run in the Detroit seventh that tied it. The Tigers wasted a terrific chance an inning later following some risky Texas strategy.	With one out and nobody on, the Rangers intentionally walked Cabrera, practically daring the rest of the struggling Detroit lineup to beat them. The AL batting champion hit a two-run double earlier in the game, in fact.	"First time shame on you, next time shame on me," Washington said.	Victor Martinez, who hurt his ribcage on a home run swing in Game 3, followed with a single to right and Cabrera lumbered around to third.	"I respect Martinez a heck of a lot," Washington said. "Once again, he got that base hit and we almost paid for it, but I certainly wasn't going to let (Cabrera) have a swing of the bat there and beat us."	Young, another Tigers starter who has been banged up lately, managed to lift the ball to medium right. Cruz caught it and made a perfect, one-hop throw to the plate that beat Cabrera by several feet.	Cabrera bowled over Napoli, to no avail. Napoli held onto the ball and Cabrera never touched the plate.	"We throw to the bases every day," Cruz said. "We take flyballs every day, make sure we know the ballpark, we know any situation we can be involved in during the game. When you prepare, everything comes more easy."	Austin Jackson was hit by a pitch with one out in the Detroit 10th, but Napoli threw him out stealing, and reliever Scott Feldman made it through the inning without further trouble.	"I'm glad I can do it on the defensive side," said Napoli, who was traded from the Los Angeles Angels to Toronto and then to Texas in the offseason. "I kind of got labeled as not too good behind the plate, and I'm glad I can show it and be myself behind the plate and just help us win."	Feldman got the win and Texas closer Neftali Feliz worked the 11th.	Cruz tried to contribute with his legs, too. He was on first base with two outs in the ninth and tried to steal second while Tigers reliever Joaquin Benoit was holding the ball. The pitcher stepped and threw to second to retire Cruz.	Valverde had already pitched a perfect 10th, but he couldn't hold off Texas for another inning. Cruz was mobbed by teammates at the Texas dugout after his homer, and Detroit fans began heading for the exits. Some of those that remained began applauding Valverde, who hasn't blown a save all year but was unable to keep this game going for another inning.	"It's one of the best baseball games I've ever been involved in," Detroit manager Jim Leyland said. "Just didn't come out the right way."	The teams waited through a rain delay of 2 hours, 13 minutes before the first pitch. The game was supposed to begin at 4:19 p.m. EDT, but the rain didn't let up until around 5:30. Fans then began filling the seats closest to the field and, about 20 minutes later, the grounds crew came out to remove the tarp.	A misty rain began falling again around the end of the second inning, and umbrellas started popping up all over the ballpark. Water would kick up as the ball hopped along the grass, but the rain wasn't a factor in the late innings.	Cabrera hit his two-run double in the third, but Texas scored three times in the sixth.	Inge tied it with a stunning homer off Alexi Ogando in the seventh. The Detroit third baseman hit .170 against right-handers during the regular season with no homers in 171 at-bats, but he lifted a high drive to left field that seemed to stay in the air forever before clearing the fence to make it 3-all.	Rangers relievers allowed only one run in 15 innings through the first three games of the ALCS -- and they allowed only one in Game 4.	Detroit's Rick Porcello allowed three runs -- two earned -- and eight hits in 6 2/3 innings. He struck out six with no walks.	Matt Harrison allowed two runs and three hits in five innings for Texas.	Porcello breezed through the first five innings, bringing the Detroit crowd to its feet with each scoreless frame. The 22-year-old right-hander finally faltered in the sixth. After a leadoff single by David Murphy, Ian Kinsler hit a one-out double, and Murphy scored when Young misplayed the carom in the left field corner.	After Kinsler stole third, bringing Detroit's infield in, Elvis Andrus tied it with a single to right-center.	Trying to hold the speedy Andrus close to first, Porcello made a pickoff throw that hit the runner and bounced away, allowing Andrus to take second. Porcello was charged with an error, then paid an even bigger price when Michael Young's single up the middle put the Rangers ahead 3-2.	Young was 3 for 29 this postseason before that hit.	Game notes	 Delmon Young has been banged up all series but made a nice running catch near the wall in the fourth. ... The last time a team intentionally walked the potential winning or tying run with nobody on and at least one out in the eighth inning or later in a playoff game was Oct. 22, 2009, according to STATS LLC. The Angels gave Yankees star Alex Rodriguez a free pass with two outs in the ninth inning and a one-run lead in Game 5 of the ALCS. New York ended up loading the bases, but Nick Swisher hit a game-ending popup. ... Valverde has a 0.52 ERA this year in save chances, including the playoffs, according to STATS. In non-save situations, his ERA is 6.83.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ST. LOUIS --  Chris Carpenter needed a pick-me-up in the worst way. A bullpen that just sat back and watched the last time the St. Louis Cardinals ace pitched was ready for extended duty.	Albert Pujols hit an RBI double off Yovani Gallardo during a four-run first inning and four St. Louis relievers combined for four perfect innings Wednesday night for a 4-3 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers and a 2-1 edge in the NL championship series.	Suddenly, the wild-card Cardinals are front-runners. And against the team that put them away early en route to the NL Central title.	"I think our ballclub, no matter leading or behind, it doesn't really matter to be honest with you," Carpenter said. "We have battled for the last two months or however long it's been.	"We have nothing to lose."	The Brewers have lost eight in a row on the road in the postseason, a stretch that extends to Game 1 of the 1982 World Series in St. Louis on a shutout by Mike Caldwell. It's the longest current streak in the majors.	"I think regardless of whether we're winning or losing the series, we recognize what's at stake," Brewers star Ryan Braun said. "We're going to prepare ourselves just like we've been doing and expect to win tomorrow and hopefully get off to a good start."	In a matchup of star pitchers, neither starter made it past the fifth inning. Gallardo tied an NLCS record with three wild pitches, while the one-run lead Carpenter handed over to the relievers was just enough to put the Cardinals ahead in the best-of-seven series.	It was a game played in a steady drizzle but with no squirrel sightings -- at least not on the field. In the previous playoff game at Busch Stadium, a squirrel scampered across home plate while the Cardinals were hitting.	The careening critter quickly became a favorite in St. Louis as the Rally Squirrel. The Cardinals' marketing department capitalized, too, giving away 40,000 rally towels with a squirrel theme, telling fans to "Go Nuts" on the video board and dressing up someone in a squirrel costume to entertain the fans between innings.	There was at least one squirrel sighting in the stands. One rodent got stuck underneath a vendor's station just outside the press box before the game, leaping to safety and up the steps to the upper deck after a worker opened a side compartment.	Kyle Lohse, pitching on 12 days' rest, starts Game 4 Thursday for the wild-card Cardinals against Randy Wolf.	"You never know how it's going to work out," Carpenter said. "That's what's so fun about this game and that's what's so fun about pitching. Our guys did a fabulous job."	Fernando Salas, Lance Lynn, Marc Rzepczynski and Jason Motte shut down the Brewers to close out the victory. Motte, who had two saves lasting more than inning in September and another in the first round of the playoffs against Philadelphia, got four outs for this save and fanned pinch hitter Casey McGehee to end it.	"We've won games in several ways," Cardinals outfielder Lance Berkman said. "Tonight's was the bullpen's night to shine."	Carpenter won his seventh postseason game to tie Bob Gibson's franchise record, but with none of the brilliance of his three-hit shutout over Roy Halladay and the favored Phillies in the deciding game of the division series. He lasted only five innings, with nearly half of his 89 pitches for balls.	The starters' ineffectiveness was surprising considering their track records.	Carpenter has been clutch throughout his career in the postseason, going 7-2 with a 3.14 ERA in 12 games. Gallardo allowed only two runs in 21 innings, a minuscule 0.86 ERA, before Game 3.	The Cardinals have scored in the first inning in their last five games, and batted around against Gallardo in the first. Pujols delivered an RBI double after starring in a Game 2 win with a home run and three doubles, and then singled in the second to give him six hits in a stretch of seven at-bats.	St. Louis had its chances to break away later, but hit into three double plays and stranded nine runners. The Cardinals broke their own National League record for double plays this season.	Mark Kotsay started ahead of slumping Nyjer Morgan and homered for the Brewers. Yuniesky Betancourt had two singles and an RBI and Gallardo, a .221 hitter with a homer and four RBIs, had a sacrifice fly in the second.	Jon Jay and David Freese added RBI doubles in the first for St. Louis, which was 3 for 4 with runners in scoring position to start the game but 0 for 7 the rest of the way.	Gallardo, who's 1-7 with a 5.66 career mark against the Cardinals, trailed 2-0 after his first 12 pitches and barely made it out of the first trailing 4-0. The right-hander walked three, one of them intentional, and the Brewers had Chris Narveson up in the bullpen before Yadier Molina grounded into a double play, scoring the fourth run, for his first outs.	Gallardo trudged to the dugout after his 33-pitch ordeal. He was looking forward to another chance at St. Louis.	"Yeah, I mean, of course," Gallardo said. "I look forward to it. I can't wait and hopefully we'll get another shot at it."	Luckily for the Brewers, Carpenter didn't have his "A" game, either. By the third, the lead was down to one run.	The Cardinals' ace walked none in his brilliant three-hit shutout in Game 5 of the NLDS, but had a walk and a hit batsman in the Brewers' first three plate appearances.	Carpenter escaped with help from Kotsay, who strayed too far off second on Prince Fielder's lineout to center and was doubled off the bag by Jay's strong throw to end the inning. But Carpenter didn't look comfortable in the second or third, either.	The Brewers opened the second with three straight singles with Betancourt getting the RBI. Gallardo, who batted .221 with a homer and four RBIs this season, added a sacrifice fly that cut the deficit to 4-2.	Kotsay got a spot start, partly because he's 4 for 11 against Carpenter. Kotsay hit his second career postseason homer leading off the third. Morgan flied out to start the seventh as a pinch hitter and was roundly booed throughout the at-bat.	Kotsay just missed a diving catch on Jay's bloop double to left-center in the first, a play manager Ron Roenicke said Carlos Gomez would have made. But Roenicke said Gomez was never a consideration for the lineup.	Game notes	 Hall of Famer Stan Musial made a pregame appearance at home plate via golf cart, accompanied to music from "The Natural," and was flanked by fellow Cardinals Hall of Famers Bob Gibson, Lou Brock and Red Schoendienst. ... Two stars from the Cardinals' 2006 World Series title team collaborated on the first pitch. Jeff Suppan, the NLCS MVP that year, threw to injured pitcher Adam Wainwright, who got the last out of the '06 NLCS when he froze the Mets' Carlos Beltran for a called third strike. Suppan played his last seven seasons with the Cardinals and Brewers. ... Pujols has 16 postseason walks, moving past Jim Edmonds for the franchise record. ... Betancourt singled his first two trips and had been on a 10-for-18 run before a flyout in the sixth. ... Braun has hit in seven of eight postseason games this season, going 14 for 29 (.483) with two homers and eight RBIs.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

DETROIT -- One moment, Justin Verlander and the Tigers were on the verge of watching their season slip away.	After a double play and a lucky bounce, they were headed back to Texas.	Verlander helped save Detroit's season with a gutsy effort and the Tigers hit for a sudden cycle to break away in a 7-5 victory Thursday that cut the Rangers' lead to 3-2 in the AL championship series.	Delmon Young hit two of Detroit's four homers and Miguel Cabrera had a tiebreaking double in the sixth inning -- thanks to a bizarre bounce off third base.	"I have that bag in my office right now. And that will be in my memorabilia room at some point in my life, I can promise you," Tigers manager Jim Leyland said.	After building a five-run cushion, Detroit held on despite Nelson Cruz's record fifth home run of the series. With closer Jose Valverde unavailable for the Tigers, Texas cut it to 7-5 in the ninth and had Cruz on deck when Phil Coke retired Mike Napoli on a game-ending groundout with two runners on.	Coke got five outs for his first career postseason save.	"Cokie came through for us," Leyland said. "A little different situation for him obviously, but he was up to the challenge."	The Rangers get another chance to reach the World Series for the second straight season in Game 6 Saturday night at home. Derek Holland will start for Texas against Max Scherzer.	A swift turn of events in the sixth helped Detroit pull ahead. The Tigers turned a bases-loaded double play to keep the score tied at 2, then opened the bottom half with a single, double, triple and homer -- in order -- to take a 6-2 lead.	It was the first time four consecutive batters on one team hit for a "natural" cycle in a postseason game, according to STATS LLC.	The Rangers were the ones who seemed on the verge of breaking the game open in the sixth, loading the bases with one out. But then Ian Kinsler hit a grounder right to third baseman Brandon Inge, who merely had to step on the bag and throw to first for a double play.	"We had him right there in the sixth. He got out of it," Texas manager Ron Washington said. "We missed a home run by inches, and they opened the game up by inches. Got a groundball double play, hits the bag, and from that point on, you know, boom, bam. Put up four runs."	Ryan Raburn led off the bottom half with a single, and what looked to be a routine grounder by Cabrera bounced high off third base and down the line, putting Detroit ahead 3-2.	"We were lucky, but we need lucky times right now," Cabrera said. "Hopefully we're lucky Saturday."	Victor Martinez followed with a rare triple down the right-field line, scoring another run, and Young added a two-run homer.	Raburn homered in the seventh to make it 7-2.	After using Valverde and Joaquin Benoit for three straight days, Leyland announced before Game 5 that neither reliever would be available. He was hoping to make it through the day with just Verlander and Coke, and that's exactly what happened.	"Well, it's what we said before the game. So it gave everybody a chance to get all their second-guessing ready about it," Leyland said. "That's just the way it had to be today. We talked about it before the game and we did exactly what we felt we had to do to give ourselves any chance to win the series."	Verlander allowed four runs and eight hits in 7 1/3 innings, throwing a career-high 133 pitches. He struck out eight and walked three.	"I want the ball. I want to go as deep as possible," Verlander said. "It was a battle for me, all night."	Verlander reached 100 mph on the stadium radar gun with pitch No. 133. Cruz, however, caught up to that fastball and sent it down the left-field line for a two-run homer, chasing Verlander and setting a record for homers in a league championship series.	"He struck me out twice with curveballs, so I was glad he threw me a fastball, even if it was 100 (mph)," Cruz said. "I think I might have had streaks like this in the minors, maybe, but I've never hit this many homers this fast in the majors."	Cruz became the fifth player to hit five homers in a postseason series. Reggie Jackson, Ken Griffey Jr., Juan Gonzalez and Chase Utley were the others.	Verlander left the game after Cruz's homer, raising his glove to acknowledge the cheering fans.	"I don't like to do that in the middle of a ballgame, but when they show their support that way, you can't help but give them a little tip of the cap or a wave or something," Verlander said. "They've been tremendous all year."	After winning 24 games and leading the American League in ERA and strikeouts, Verlander hadn't had much of a chance to shine this postseason. Two of his first three playoff starts were ended early by rain delays.	He didn't have to worry about that Thursday. Game 5 began under a cloudy sky with the sun peeking through over Comerica Park, and the threatening sky later didn't amount to anything until a misty rain began to fall over the field -- after the game was over.	This time, the Rangers were Verlander's biggest obstacle. With two strikes on Kinsler in the first, Verlander went to his sweeping breaking ball, and the Texas second baseman pulled it to left field for a double. After going to third on a groundout by Elvis Andrus, Kinsler came home on Josh Hamilton's sacrifice fly to give the Rangers a 1-0 lead.	"I kind of haven't had my rhythm," Verlander said.	Texas starter C.J. Wilson was sharp at the start, retiring his first seven batters.	Alex Avila tied it with an opposite-field homer to left in the third. The Detroit catcher has taken a beating behind the plate all year and has had a miserable postseason, going 2 of 33 before the homer.	Young was actually left off Detroit's ALCS roster because of an injury, but he returned before Game 2 after Magglio Ordonez re-fractured his ankle. Young's homer over the fence in left-center gave Detroit a 2-1 lead in the fourth.	Hamilton's RBI single in the fifth tied the game at 2.	"This has been a tremendous, tremendous series in my opinion," Leyland said.	Wilson, a left-hander who has struggled in three playoff starts this year, was done in by Detroit's rally in the sixth and came out after that inning. He allowed six runs and eight hits, striking out five and walking two.	With two outs in the ninth, Hamilton doubled and Michael Young drove him home with a single that made it 7-5. After a walk to Adrian Beltre, Napoli grounded into a forceout, sending the series back to Texas.	"The Detroit Tigers are here for a reason. Tonight their backs were against the wall. They did what they had to do -- catching a break included," Washington said. "Now we go home. We still feel good about ourselves."	Game notes	 According to STATS, the last pitcher to throw 133 pitches in the playoffs was Mark Prior of the Chicago Cubs, who threw the same number in a 2003 NL division series game against Atlanta. ... Delmon Young has five homers in the AL playoffs. He hit three during the division series against the New York Yankees. ... Avila hit only three of his 19 homers during the regular season off left-handers. ... There were a few empty seats visible when the teams took the field for the late-afternoon start.

ST. LOUIS --  Power pitching often dominates in the postseason. Soft tosses by Randy Wolf got the Milwaukee Brewers back to even in the NL championship series.	The 35-year-old lefty outfoxed the St. Louis Cardinals for seven innings to earn his first postseason win and the Brewers got two more hits from Ryan Braun in a 4-2 victory Thursday night that evened the NL championship series at 2-all.	"It was a big feeling just to be back out there again after my last start," said Wolf, hit hard by Arizona to force a deciding Game 5 in the first round of the playoffs. "Just to be able to get another opportunity to pitch again was important.	"You know, I'll be honest with you, the day after the Diamondbacks start, I didn't eat or shower that day," he said."	Flipping some pitches in the mid-60s mph, Wolf allowed two runs and six hits, striking out six with one walk.	Matt Holliday and Allen Craig homered for the Cardinals, representing their only runs in the last 16 innings.	"I think it's classic because playing each other so many times, we're dead even," manager Tony La Russa said. "It comes down to that day, who makes the pitch."	Francisco Rodriguez allowed a hit in the eighth and John Axford finished for his second save of the series and third this postseason.	The Brewers ended an eight-game road losing streak in the postseason dating to the 1982 World Series opener at St. Louis. And Wolf ended a lengthy drought of his own -- before Thursday, his 342 starts without a postseason victory were the most among active pitchers.	Game 4 loser Kyle Lohse moves to second on the list at 298 starts, trailing only Ted Lilly's 318.	Jaime Garcia faces Zack Greinke for the second time in the series in Game 5 Friday night. Either way, the NLCS will be decided back at Miller Park.	"We're pretty much the only team that's played pretty well in Milwaukee. Flip the page and hopefully come back to tomorrow. It's a great series. Nobody is going to run away," Cardinals star Albert Pujols said.	Jerry Hairston Jr. doubled twice with an RBI and Wolf hit one of the Brewers' five doubles. Braun is batting .471 (16 for 34) in the postseason with two homers and nine RBIs.	The Cardinals needed more heavy duty from their bullpen, too, after Lohse, pitching on 12 days' rest, failed to make it out of the fifth.	"I'm not going to blame it on the layoff," Lohse said. "We're professionals and we've got get the job done. Tonight, we didn't do it."	Pujols was a quiet 1 for 4 for St. Louis, which was 0 for 8 with runners in scoring position and is 0 for 15 after the first inning of Game 3.	"They have good pitching, but we have good pitching, too," Hairston said. "They've been good for us all year long."	Wolf kept the Cardinals off-balance with soft tosses and retired 13 of his last 15 hitters in his fourth career postseason start. It was a huge improvement from Game 4 of the NL division series at Arizona in which he surrendered seven runs in three innings.	Wolf also struggled in his last two regular season starts, allowing 10 runs in 11 2-3 innings.	"Regardless of how the game went, I was satisfied with the fact that I was going to have that opportunity," Wolf said. "It's kind of a weird word, but it's redemption to go back out there."	For the fourth straight game, the Cardinals had to lean heavily on their relievers. Lohse sailed through three innings and then allowed three doubles and three runs to his last eight hitters, and was charged with three runs in 4 1-3 innings.	St. Louis relievers have worked 17 1-3 innings in the series.	Two of La Russa's moves paid off. Bumped down one spot to fifth, Holliday hit his first postseason homer and doubled.	Craig started in place of Lance Berkman, who was 3 for 32 lifetime against Wolf and had a minor right thigh bruise from getting hit by a pitch in Game 3. Craig hit his first career postseason homer made it 2-0 in the third.	The Brewers tied it in the fourth with their first runs since the third inning of Game 3 on doubles by Prince Fielder and Jerry Hairston Jr. and an RBI single by Yuniesky Betancourt.	Lohse was pulled after Nyjer Morgan doubled to start the fifth and advanced on a groundout, the heart of the order coming up. Braun's single off Mitchell Boggs put the Brewers in front although second baseman Ryan Theriot's sprawling stop transformed Fielder's smash into an inning-ending double play.	Rickie Weeks singled and Hairston doubled again to open the sixth, and the Brewers soon had a two-run cushion. George Kottaras hit a grounder against a drawn-in infield off Arthur Rhodes, and Theriot bobbled the ball on a short hop for an error.	The Cardinals' streak of scoring in the first inning ended at five games when they went down in order against Wolf, but they hurt the left-hander with opposite-field power the next two innings. Wolf fell behind the count to six of the first 14 hitters and the Cardinals were 4 for 5 with two homers, a double, single and walk.	Game notes	 Injured Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright caught the ceremonial first ball for the second straight game, this time from former Cardinals CF Jim Edmonds, accompanied by a young son who also made a throw. ... Home plate umpire Mike Everitt got stung in the upper right arm area by a foul ball off the bat of Rafael Furcal but stayed in the game. ... Mark Kotsay started in RF in place of Corey Hart, 2 for 17 against Lohse. ... The longest of Wolf's three previous preseason starts was 5 1-3 innings with the Dodgers on Oct. 19, 2009, at Philadelphia. ... An Anheuser-Busch wagon pulled by Clydesdales and loaded with baseballs made a circuit around the warning track during the pregame ceremonies.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

ST. LOUIS --  The way the Milwaukee Brewers bumbled defensively, another short start didn't slow the St. Louis Cardinals.	Milwaukee made four errors that led to three unearned runs, and the Cardinals' bullpen pitched brilliantly again to survive an early exit by Jaime Garcia in a 7-1 victory Friday night that gave St. Louis a 3-2 NL championship series lead.	The wild-card Cardinals have two tries in Milwaukee to return to the World Series for the first time since 2006.	"It's a nice win," St. Louis general manager John Mozeliak said. "But we need one more."	Yadier Molina and Matt Holliday had three hits each for St. Louis, which burst to a 3-0 lead in the second when Molina doubled in a run and third baseman Jerry Hairston Jr. allowed Garcia's grounder to go through his legs. Holliday capped the scoring with a two-run double in the eighth.	Milwaukee's infield nearly had a cycle of errors, with second baseman Rickie Weeks and shortstop Yuniesky Betancourt also committing miscues along with reliever Marco Estrada.	"We can play better than we have," said Zack Greinke, who took the loss. "And I'm sure we will."	Weeks had committed the Brewers' only two errors in the first four games of the series.	"It's definitely not focus," Brewers manager Ron Roenicke said. "These games, we do have them once in a while. We had one a couple days ago. I'm confident we'll play a good game on Sunday."	St. Louis can wrap up the best-of-seven series and its 18th NL pennant then. Edwin Jackson goes for the Cardinals against Shaun Marcum in a rematch of pitchers from Game 2, won by St. Louis 12-3 as neither starter received a decision.	"I haven't really analyzed it. I try and stay in the moment, bro," Prince Fielder said. "I'm not really looking back or forward, just trying to stay game to game. We have to win both of them, but we've got to win first."	The NL winner hosts the World Series opener against Detroit or Texas on Wednesday.	"We're having a good series right now and, hopefully, we can do it for one more game," Molina said.	Led by Jason Motte, the Cardinals' fifth closer of the season, the St. Louis bullpen is 2-0 with a 1.66 ERA in 22 2/3 innings in the series. St. Louis starters are 1-2 with a 6.04 ERA.	Only one St. Louis starter has lasted long enough to qualify for a victory, with Chris Carpenter working five innings in Game 3. The previous team to have a starter not pitch into the sixth in the first five games of a postseason series was the 1984 San Diego Padres in the World Series, according to STATS LLC.	"We're just trying to win," Holliday said. "If the spot calls for it, our bullpen's been incredible," Holliday said. "They're really fit into roles and it's been fun to watch."	The Cardinals have won 14 straight games on getaway days, a run that began on Aug. 7 at Florida. The win gave players another opportunity to chant "Happy Flight! Happy Flight!"	Milwaukee had not made more than three errors in a game during the regular season, but the Brewers' sloppiness reached a near-record level. Milwaukee was one shy of the LCS record for errors in a game, shared by the 1974 Los Angeles Dodgers and 1976 New York Yankees, according to STATS LLC.	"You've taken so many ground balls your whole life, you know what a ground ball is going to do," Hairston said. "And then when it just shoots down and scoots and once it hits that lip, it's just shock."	Cardinals manager Tony La Russa had a quick hook once again. Garcia opened with four scoreless innings, then allowed three hits and a sacrifice in a span of four at-bats in the fifth as Corey Hart singled in a run. With two and on and two outs, Octavio Dotel relieved and struck out Braun.	"There's a lot of conversation about Game 1 and how quickly they put some runs on the board," La Russa said.	Garcia was understanding.	"He's been doing this for so long and he's been so successful and he's got his reasons," the pitcher said.	Dotel (1-0) struck out two in 1 1/3 hitless innings, combining with three other relievers for 4 1/3 innings of scoreless, two-hit relief. Motte got four outs for his second save of the series,	"I'm just out there doing my thing," Motte said.	With Milwaukee down 5-1 and trying to rally with two on and two outs in the eighth, lefty Marc Rzepczynski relieved and struck out Fielder. Against Rzepczynski, Fielder is 0 for 4 with four strikeouts and two walks.	"With two strikes I said I'm just going to bounce at it and see if he swing," Rzepczynski said. "And today, he did."	Greinke left pitches over the plate in some key spots and allowed five runs -- just two earned -- and seven hits in 5 2/3 innings with no strikeouts and two walks.	"I made several mistakes that ended up costing us," Greinke said. "I definitely could have done better and made it a better game."	St. Louis had been hitless in 15 at-bats with runners in scoring position -- and 22 at-bats with runners on base -- before Molina's RBI double off the right-field fence. Hart just missed on a leaping attempt at the right field fence.	Hairston saved at least one run at third base with a spectacular diving catch to his left on Nick Punto's low liner for the second out. But when he botched Garcia's easy grounder, St. Louis was up 3-0.	Garcia's RBI groundout made it 4-0 in he fourth, the first RBI by a Cardinals pitcher in the postseason since Jeff Suppan homered in the 2006 NLCS against the Mets.	Albert Pujols had an RBI single in the sixth to chase Greinke.	Now it's on to Milwaukee, where the Brewers were a major league-best 57-24 at home during the regular season.	"They're really tough up there in their ballpark," Lance Berkman said. "It's certainly more feasible for us to have to win one of two than to win both."	Game notes	 Braun doubled in the first and has reached base safely in the opening inning of nine straight games, going 7 for 7 with a walk and hit by pitch. He has 22 hits in the postseason, matching the franchise record by Paul Molitor and Robin Yount. ... Chuck Berry, a St. Louis musical icon, performed the national anthem with his daughter, Ingrid. Wearing his trademark sailor's cap and a No. 84 Cardinals jersey (his age), Berry mostly watched and threw in occasional harmony. ... Cardinals Hall of Famer Ozzie Smith threw a one-hop first pitch with injured St. Louis starter Adam Wainwright on the receiving end for the third straight night.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  After waiting until their 50th season to reach their first World Series, the Texas Rangers are going right back.	Nelson Cruz had one more big blast, Michael Young caught the final out long after hitting a pair of doubles in one of the highest-scoring postseason innings ever and the Rangers became the American League's first repeat champion in a decade.	The team that lost Cliff Lee in free agency and held onto Young after his offseason trade request finished off the Detroit Tigers with a 15-5 romp Saturday night to win the AL championship series in six games,	"This a great trophy, we're real proud of it," Young said. "But we're looking forward to the one with all the flags on it. ... Happy, but not satisfied."	Cruz was selected ALCS MVP after his postseason-record sixth home run of the series, and he also had a record 13 RBIs. Young hit a pair of two-run doubles in a nine-run third inning that sent the Rangers on their way to becoming the AL's first consecutive pennant winner since the New York Yankees won four in a row from 1998-01.	"We wanted to get to the World Series. But the bottom line is getting to the World Series and winning it. We feel pretty confident about ourselves," manager Ron Washington said. "More than anything else, the commitment they made in November after San Francisco sent us home, they held true to it."	Texas will open the World Series on Wednesday night at St. Louis or Milwaukee, seeking the first title in the history of a franchise that started play in 1961. The World Series returns deep in the heart of Texas with Game 3 next Saturday night.	Young, who also homered and had five RBIs in the finale, caught Brandon Inge's game-ending popout in short right field and pumped a right hand into the air signaling "No. 1" while fireworks and confetti filled the sky, then ran toward the middle of the field to celebrate with his teammates.	Cruz threw both hands in the air and briefly knelt to a knee in the outfield before running to the infield for the ginger ale-spraying celebration, and a banner was unfurled high over center field declaring the Rangers 2011 AL champions. The postgame celebration included Cruz getting the AL MVP trophy.	"It was fun to watch," last year's AL MVP Josh Hamilton said of Cruz. "It's one thing to be in the stands. But when you're down here on the field with him, you can see the intensity, see the focus. To watch him do that was incredible."	With former President George W. Bush seated in the front row alongside Hall of Fame pitcher Nolan Ryan, part of the ownership group that took over the team last year, Washington was at the edge of the dugout wildly waving his arms and shouting encouragement as the big inning unfolded.	All Tigers manager Jim Leyland could do was take off his cap and scratch his head as the Rangers kept reaching base off starter Max Scherzer and three relievers.	"He was out of whack for the most part all the way. His control was not good from the get go, really. And he had a tough time. And we just couldn't stop the bleeding," Leyland said. "As the game went on, obviously, it really wasn't fair."	A franchise that began as the expansion Washington Senators and moved to Texas in 1972 had failed to reach the World Series before losing to the Giants in five games last year. The Rangers had never even won a postseason series before last season.	"As soon as the season began, we were hungry, we were hungry to get back," Rangers shortstop Elvis Andrus said.	Texas overcame a 2-0 deficit by sending 14 batters to the plate against Scherzer (0-1) and three relievers in the highest-scoring postseason inning since 2002.	Alexi Ogando (2-0) pitched two scoreless innings for his second win in the series.	While Young became only the fourth player in postseason history with two extra-base hits in the same inning -- first a tying double into the left-field corner and then one down the right field line for a 9-2 lead -- every batter in the Texas lineup reached base at least once in the third. By the time all the fireworks was over, the Rangers scored the most runs ever in a postseason game against the Tigers and the most in any postseason contest since the Yankees routed Boston 19-8 in Game 3 of the 2004 ALCS.	Also among the sellout crowd of 51,508 was Dirk Nowitzki, MVP of the NBA Finals won by the Dallas Mavericks in June.	Now the Rangers get another chance to bring another championship to the Dallas-Fort Worth area.	In his 11th season in Texas, Young had played in 1,508 regular-season games before finally getting into the playoffs last year. He added a huge exclamation point to his already big night when he led off the seventh with a 416-foot homer to straightaway center.	His five RBIs matched the Rangers postseason record, set by Cruz in Game 2.	Last winter, Young had requested a trade after the Rangers signed Adrian Beltre and acquired Mike Napoli, moves that led to Young becoming primarily a designated hitter and first baseman, a position he had never played. He had already been a starting second baseman and an All-Star at shortstop and third base.	Young's two doubles came in the highest-scoring inning in a postseason game since the Angels matched a playoff record with 10 runs in the seventh inning of Game 5 during the 2002 ALCS against Minnesota.	Texas' big inning started when Andrus drew a one-out walk, and Josh Hamilton blooped an opposite-field single to left. After Young tied it, Beltre hit a go-ahead single under the leg of Scherzer, who was gone after consecutive walks to Napoli and Cruz.	Cruz fought back from an 0-2 count for his walk. On a checked swing on a 2-2 pitch, Scherzer and Leyland both reacted in disbelief when first base umpire Tim Welke signaled no swing. When the next pitch was ball four, Cruz flipped his bat away and quickly clapped his hands.	David Murphy hit a two-run single off Daniel Schlereth, facing his only batter in his only appearance of the series. Game 4 starter Rick Porcello took over and pinch-hitter Craig Gentry reached on a fielder's choice as Murphy beat the throw to second. Ian Kinsler's two-run single made it 7-2, and Young's second double boosted the margin to 9-2.	When Ryan Perry finally induced Beltre to hit an inning-ending flyout, fans roared in anticipation of a World Series berth that wouldn't be official for five more innings. Most wildly waved white rally towels, and another behind the Rangers dugout swayed a Texas state flag back-and-forth high in the air.	Detroit had already avoided elimination twice this postseason, winning Game 5 of the AL division series at Yankee Stadium and then extending the ALCS with a 7-5 win at home Thursday.	Derek Holland allowed solo homers to Miguel Cabrera in the first and Jhonny Peralta in the second as Detroit, seeking its first Series title since 1984, tried to force a Game 7.	"I don't think I've ever been prouder of a team than I am of this team," Leyland said. "They gave everything they had."	Game notes	Holland, who didn't make it out of the third inning in Game 2, gave up four runs and seven hits in 4 2-3 innings. He left after Austin Jackson's two-run homer in the fifth.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MILWAUKEE -- Left behind in the postseason race, the St. Louis Cardinals decided to focus on small goals in	September. Now, the ultimate one is within reach.	The Cardinals' wild ride is headed to the World Series.	"It's kind of surreal that we're here," said third baseman	David Freese, who took MVP honors in the series. "But this team	deserves what we've been rewarded."	Freese hit a three-run homer in the first inning and manager	Tony La Russa again turned to his brilliant bullpen for seven	sturdy innings as St. Louis captured its 18th pennant with a 12-6	victory over the Milwaukee Brewers on Sunday night.	"For two weeks in August we started mugging games left and	right and we had to say, hey, look, unless we go about this better,	we're going to ruin everything we accomplished as far as respect,"	La Russa said. "And we started winning a little bit. And literally	played every game like it was the last game of our life."	Trailing by 10½ games in the wild-card race on Aug. 25, the	Cardinals surged down the stretch and took advantage of a	monumental collapse by Atlanta to win a playoff spot on the final	night of the regular season.	In a twist of fate, it was Philadelphia that helped them get in	by completing a three-game sweep of the Braves.	Once in the postseason, Albert Pujols and the Cardinals took out	the heavily favored Phillies in the first round, then dispatched	the division-rival Brewers on their own turf in Game 6 of the NL	Championship Series.	"I mean, you could have never known," Pujols said.	Freese, often overlooked in a lineup anchored by All-Stars,	batted .545 with three homers and nine RBIs in the series.	Looking for its second title in six seasons, St. Louis opens the	World Series at home Wednesday night with ace Chris Carpenter on	the mound against the AL champion Texas Rangers.	It's been such a frenetic run, it seems fitting that a squirrel	has become the team's unofficial mascot.	The rally squirrel started in the division series against	Philadelphia when the furry rodent scampered across home plate	during Game 4. Another squirrel was on the field before Game 5 when	Carpenter shut out the Phillies.	Reliever Octavio Dotel carries a small, stuffed squirrel with	him after a Philadelphia fan tossed it to him in jest, a tangible	sign of where the Cardinals have come from.	"I lay in my bed thinking, 'Wow, we are in this position.' I	cannot believe it personally. I can't believe where we are after	the way we played the last month, and the way Atlanta played,"	Dotel said. "It's crazy to be where we are right now. I don't know	how to explain that to you. The only thing I know is we're here and	we're looking forward to keep winning games."	Bolstered by a group of no-name relievers who keep answering La	Russa's call, the Cardinals are back in the World Series for the	first time since beating Detroit in 2006.	"We had a lot of adversity, but we found a way," Cardinals	left fielder Matt Holliday said.	It was a disappointing end to a scintillating season for Prince Fielder, Ryan Braun and the NL Central champion Brewers, who	finished with a franchise-record 96 wins, six games ahead of St.	Louis in the division.	Baseball's best home team collapsed in the NLCS, though, losing	twice at Miller Park in an error-filled flop. It was likely	Fielder's final game with the Brewers, too. He can become a free	agent after the season.	"I had to clear the throat once, but it was all right. I love	these guys," said Fielder, a first-round draft pick in 2002.	"I've been playing with most of them since I was 18. So this	organization has been great to me."	Rafael Furcal and Pujols hit solo homers off Chris Narveson and	St. Louis built a 9-4 lead by the time the bullpen took over for	Edwin Jackson in the third inning.	The group of Fernando Salas, Marc Rzepczynski, Dotel, Lance Lynn	and Jason Motte allowed two runs the rest of the way. For the	series, St. Louis relievers finished 3-0 with a 1.88 ERA over 28	2/3 innings.	The most lasting image of this NLCS has been La Russa on the	bullpen phone.	"He's a genius, isn't he?" said Motte, the fifth closer this	year for the Cardinals.	St. Louis built an 11-5 lead before the biggest scare came when	Pujols was shaken up after tagging out Braun in the fifth inning.	The three-time MVP fell hard on his right forearm on a close play	at first base.	"I got spiked. I didn't feel too good but as long as I can walk	I'm playing in that game," Pujols said. "It's the postseason.	Nothing hurts. You don't think about it. You think about making a	play. If you got hurt, hey at least you got hurt trying something	hard."	The Cardinals took control of this series beginning in Game 2 by	jumping out to early leads and letting the bullpen lead the way.	La Russa called on his relievers 28 times in the NLCS and	Jackson's start was the shortest of the postseason for the	rotation, which finished the NLCS with a 7.66 ERA. St. Louis became	the first team to win a postseason series without a starter	reaching the sixth inning, according to STATS LLC.	Freese gave his teammates credit while accepting the MVP award.	"I wish we could make eight or nine of these and give them to	our bullpen. They're the reason why we won this series," he said.	Corey Hart, Rickie Weeks and Jonathan Lucroy all homered for the	Brewers, who won a major league-best 57 home games at Miller Park	this season and four straight in the postseason before losing Game	2 to the Cardinals.	The Brewers' biggest hitters -- Braun, Fielder and Weeks -	finished 1 for 12 in Game 6. Fielder, the All-Star game MVP and the	reason St. Louis will start at home on Wednesday, received a	standing ovation in his final at-bat in the eighth. He grounded out	and slowly walked back to the dugout with his head down.	"Obviously I envisioned us winning the World Series, but that	didn't happen," Fielder said. "We had a great year as a team.	Unfortunately we didn't get to where we wanted to go. But still	some great moments and great memories in there. Like I said, this	year has been awesome."	It was the two ugly defensive performances that will likely	linger for Milwaukee, which committed four errors in a 7-1 loss in	Game 5 and added three more in Game 6.	"You can't get away with mistakes to them and we made way too	many mistakes," manager Ron Roenicke said.	Struggling starter Shaun Marcum never really gave Milwaukee a	chance and was hurt by defensive plays that weren't ruled errors.	In the first, Jon Jay singled with one out and stole second when	Weeks couldn't hold onto Lucroy's low throw. Marcum believed he had	strike three on Pujols, who ended up walking.	Lance Berkman singled for the second hit in 18 career at-bats	against Marcum to drive in the first run, and center fielder Nyjer	Morgan made an ill-advised throw to third that let Berkman reach	second.	Marcum saved a run by grabbing Holliday's dribbler and flipping	it out of his glove to Lucroy to get Pujols at the plate, but	Freese homered on the next pitch to make it 4-0 and extend his	postseason hitting streak to 10 games.	"We believe," Freese said. "I think that's what you've got to	do in this game. We got a group of guys with some talent, desire,	and just a ton of heart."	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

ST. LOUIS --  Nelson Cruz saw the ball slicing off Allen Craig's bat, sprinted to the foul line and slid, desperately trying to run down the tailing liner.	"It was close," the right fielder said.	He came up just short, and so did the Texas Rangers.	Craig's pinch-hit drive landed an inch or two in front of Cruz's outstretched glove for a go-ahead single off reliever Alexi Ogando in the sixth inning, and that was the difference as the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Rangers 3-2 Wednesday night in a chilly World Series opener	"Baseball is like that. Inches," Cruz said.	On a night when all the runs were driven in with opposite-field hits to right, Lance Berkman put St. Louis ahead with a two-run single in the fourth against C.J. Wilson.	Rangers catcher Mike Napoli watched in dejection as Albert Pujols and Matt Holliday scored, but a few minutes later celebrated in the top of the fifth when he tied it 2-all with a two-run homer off Chris Carpenter.	"A tough loss," Napoli said. "But we shake things off pretty good."	Indeed, the two-time AL champions haven't lost consecutive games since Aug. 23-25 against Boston.	The high-octane Rangers had their chances. But Texas was 0 for 5 with runners in scoring position after rolling up a .302 average (19 for 63) in those situations during the AL Championship Series against Detroit.	"I don't think we did the job when we needed," Cruz said. "Men in scoring position is when you need to deliver."	Game 1 has been an indicator of success in recent decades: The winner has captured seven of the last eight titles, 12 of the last 14 and 19 of the last 23. In addition, the team hosting Game 1 has won 20 of the last 25 World Series.	Last year, when the Rangers made their first World Series appearance, they lost the opener to San Francisco 11-7, and the Giants went on to win the title in five games.	Now it's up to Colby Lewis, who starts for the Rangers on Thursday night against Jaime Garcia. Lewis will try to send the Series back to Texas tied at a game apiece.	Taking over as ace after Cliff Lee left to sign with Philadelphia, Wilson dropped to 0-3 with a 7.17 ERA in four postseason starts this year, allowing three runs and four hits in 5 2/3 innings with a career-high six walks -- two of them intentional.	He prepared for the start by getting in a tank of liquid nitrogen at 295 degrees below zero -- the treatment is said to aid recovery -- but on a blustery, 49-degree night his walks and a key wild pitch got him into some hot spots.	He fell behind after bouncing a pitch in the fourth that hit Pujols on the left foot. That started a streak of three bad pitches in a four-pitch span.	Wilson tried to go inside on Holliday but left the next one over the plate, and Holliday hit an opposite-field double into the right-field corner as Pujols took third.	Then, with the count 1-0 to Berkman, Wilson tried to go inside again but allowed a cutter to drift over the plate. Berkman went the other way and chopped the ball over first base and into right field as the Cardinals took a 2-0 lead. Wilson shook his head back and forth as he walked back to the mound.	"A cutter kind of down and away. He inside-outed it, and it took a weird bounce," Wilson said. "It's not like I'm sitting there serving up home runs. I gave up a couple of singles or whatever. It's just the way the ball bounces."	That lead was short-lived.	Adrian Beltre singled leading off the fifth and, one out later, Napoli hit a no-doubt drive about 10 rows deep into the right-field seats for his second home run of the postseason. A fired-up Carpenter had escaped a two-on, none-out jam in the second when Napoli hit into an inning-ending double play.	Pujols had Cardinals fans cheering in the top of the sixth when he slid to stop Michael Young's grounder behind first and threw to Carpenter for the out, stranding Ian Kinsler at third.	Then in the bottom half, NLCS MVP David Freese hit an opposite-field double to right with one out and went to third on a wild pitch. Wilson struck out Yadier Molina, then pitched carefully to Nick Punto and walked him on four pitches.	"The plan was not to give in," Wilson said. "I know they had either Carpenter coming up or a pinch hitter, and with Ogando warming up behind me, I have confidence that he's going to come in and get that guy out."	Ogando relieved, and with many of the red-clad Cardinals fans standing and waving white towels, Craig stroked a 1-2 pitch down the right field line. Cruz thought that when he slid past the grass onto the dirt, the friction slowed him down.	"I think the dirt caught me," he said.	Carpenter became the first St. Louis starter to reach the sixth inning since the division series. He got the win, allowing two runs and five hits in six innings with four strikeouts and one walk. Fernando Salas, Marc Rzepczynski, Octavio Dotel, Arthur Rhodes and Jason Motte followed, with Motte getting three straight outs for his fifth postseason save to complete three innings of one-hit relief.	With one out in the ninth, Beltre was called out on a grounder to third on a ball that appeared to bounce off his foot and could have been ruled foul. The call didn't go the Rangers' way.	It was that kind of night.	"The pinch hitter got it done, and ours didn't," manager Ron Washington said. "Got to give them credit, they beat us. We didn't give that game away tonight."	Game notes	 Craig had the first go-ahead RBI by a pinch-hitter in the Series since Wade Boggs' bases-loaded walk for the Yankees in Game 4 against Atlanta in 1996. ... The NL is seeking its first consecutive World Series titles since winning four in a row from 1979-82 (Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and St. Louis). ... It was the earliest date the World Series started since 2003.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

ST. LOUIS --  Jason Motte stood in front of his locker in the quiet Cardinals clubhouse and said the same thing over and over: "I didn't do my job."	Three outs from taking a 2-0 World Series lead to Texas, St. Louis instead finds itself tied with the Rangers at a game apiece.	Motte allowed consecutive singles to open the ninth inning, and sacrifice flies by Josh Hamilton and Michael Young lifted the Rangers to a 2-1 victory Thursday night.	"It was almost a great story for us," Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said. "Turned out to be a greater one for them."	In a virtual repeat of the opener, pinch-hitter Allen Craig put the Cardinals ahead with a seventh-inning single off Alexi Ogando.	St. Louis starter Jaime Garcia allowed three hits in seven shutout innings before Fernando Salas and Marc Rzepczynski combined for a hitless eighth. But a day after Motte finished off a 3-2 win with a 1-2-3 ninth, Ian Kinsler blooped a leadoff single to left, just beyond the reach of shortstop Rafael Furcal. Kinsler then stole second, narrowly beating Yadier Molina's throw.	"I mean, my hand just barely got in there. It took everything I had," Kinsler said. "Yadier made an unbelievable throw, quick, on the money, and I was just able to get my hand in there."	Elvis Andrus, who saved a run in the fifth with an amazing glove flip from shortstop, singled to center for his first hit in seven at-bats in the Series. Kinsler took a wide turn, then retreated to third, and Andrus advanced when Jon Jay's throw got past cutoff man Albert Pujols.	"It stinks. It's one of those things," Motte said. "I went out there and made a good pitch to Kinsler, and he did a good piece of hitting and got enough on it to get it out of the reach of Furcal. The next one, I threw another cutter, and it just wasn't a good pitch. It moved, came back, just stayed middle and spun up there."	More than an hour after the game, the three official scorers decided to charge Pujols with an error.	"I should have made a better throw right there. It was the big part of the game," Jay said. "It was off-line a little bit."	After making all the right moves in the opener, La Russa brought in lefty Arthur Rhodes to face Hamilton, who is hitless in 16 consecutive World Series at-bats dating to Game 3 against San Francisco last year. La Russa decided against an intentional walk.	"Load the bases, that's a really difficult thing to do," La Russa said. "I don't think walking him there would have made it easier for us. I think it would have made it tougher."	Hamilton, the reigning AL MVP, drove home Kinsler with a fly to right.	"It would have been a grounder if I would have kept it down," Rhodes said.	Lance Lynn relieved, and Young hit a fly to center that scored Andrus with the go-ahead run.	Motte took the loss, and Mike Adams got the win with a scoreless eighth. Neftali Feliz pitched the ninth for the save, walking Molina before striking out Nick Punto and Skip Schumaker. Furcal flied out to end it.	"It's baseball. That's the way this game is," Motte said. "You're going to have good days, bad days."	When the Series shifts to Texas on Saturday night, Matt Harrison starts Game 3 for the Rangers against Kyle Lohse. Derek Holland goes for Texas in Game 4 on Sunday and Edwin Jackson for the Cardinals.	While Pujols dropped to 0-for-6 in the Series and Matt Holliday fell to 1-for-6 (.167), David Freese sparked the Cardinals in the seventh when he singled with one out against Colby Lewis. Punto, the No. 8 batter, hit a single off the glove of Young -- who played first only 36 times during the regular season.	That knocked out both starters, with Ogando coming in to face Craig for the second straight night.	Craig fouled off a pitch, then lined a single to right-center that sent Freese home and energized a sellout crowd of 47,288 at Busch Stadium.	"Kind of deja vu," Craig said.	Two innings earlier, Furcal came up with two on and two outs and hit a one-hop smash to the shortstop side of second, but Andrus ranged over to make a diving stop. From his knees on the outfield grass, he flipped the ball with his glove to Kinsler, who just beat a sliding Garcia to second base.	"The play was ridiculous," Kinsler said. "It doesn't get any better than that."	Game notes	 Texas has not lost consecutive games since Aug. 23-25 at Boston and avoided a repeat of last year, when the Rangers went to San Francisco and were beaten by the Giants 11-7 and 9-0 in the first two games. The Giants went on to win the Series in five games. ... Teams winning the opener have won seven of the last eight titles, 12 of the last 14 and 19 of the last 23. Of teams that won Game 2 to even the Series, 29 of 54 have gone on to win -- but just two of the last seven, the 2002 Angels and the 2009 Yankees. ... A night after a cold, rainy opener, it was slightly warmer, with a game-time temperature of 50 degrees. ... Stan Musial, the Cardinals Hall of Famer who turns 91 next month, attended the game at Busch Stadium.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.	Jhoulys Chacín has agreed to a guaranteed $1.25 million, one-year contract with the Rockies.	The Milwaukee Brewers acquired infielder Mike Brosseau from the Tampa Bay Rays for minor league pitcher Evan Reifert on Saturday in a trade between division winners.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Albert Pujols began the game hoping to shake his slump and maybe get a hit.	He did that, and a whole lot more: He produced the defining game of his career, and perhaps the greatest hitting performance in World Series history.	Pujols launched three impressive homers, drove in six runs and finished with five hits -- tying a Series record with each accomplishment -- as the St. Louis Cardinals romped past the Texas Rangers 16-7 on Saturday night for a 2-1 edge.	"Just pretty special," he said.	The three-time NL MVP matched Babe Ruth and Reggie Jackson for the most home runs in a game. Pujols added two singles and set a Series mark with 14 total bases.	"Hopefully, at the end of my career, I can look back and say, 'Wow, what a game it was in Game 3 in 2011,'" Pujols said.	And to think, his night began with a groundout that left him 0 for 7 against Texas.	"I mean, with Babe and Reggie, that's pretty good company right there," Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said.	The outburst by Pujols came a day after he was barbed by the media for not sticking around to talk about a Game 2 error and loss. This time, everyone was talking about him.	"When the opportunity presents itself to put him on the bag, I'm not going to let him swing the bat," Texas manager Ron Washington said. "But tonight, we just couldn't get the ball out of the middle of the plate and up, and he just didn't miss.	"I saw him on TV but I'll tell you, tonight was something special."	The Cardinals mashed their way to the highest-scoring game in their storied postseason history, breaking away after first base umpire Ron Kulpa's admitted blown call.	After two taut games in St. Louis, this suddenly turned into a messy slugfest. Pujols, the most feared slugger in the majors, was right in the middle -- he became the first player in Series history to get hits in four straight innings.	So much for any worries about Pujols making a dent.	"I was hitting the ball hard, but I wasn't getting any hits," he said. "But all it takes is one good game. I got five hits, what are they going to say about it?"	Texas fans booed after Kulpa's miss helped the Cardinals score four times in the fourth for a 5-0 lead. The crowd at Rangers Ballpark went silent when Pujols started swinging for the fences, and beyond. His three-run shot in the sixth rattled the windows of the club level in left field.	Game 4 is Sunday night, with Derek Holland starting for the Rangers against Edwin Jackson. It will be the back half of a St. Louis-Texas style doubleheader -- earlier in the day, the Rams play the Dallas Cowboys right across the parking lot.	This game had an NFL score, too. The teams combined for 23 runs and 28 hits -- at Busch Stadium, they teamed for eight runs and 23 hits in two games.	"You leave a ball up in this park it's going to carry a little more than it does in St. Louis," Pujols said.	Pujols joined Ruth, who hit three homers in games against the Cardinals in 1926 and 1928, and Jackson's three-homer show against the Dodgers in 1977. Pujols' six RBIs matched Bobby Richardson in 1960 and Hideki Matsui in 2009.	Oh, Pujols also matched the Series mark for hits in a game set by Paul Molitor in 1982.	"It's an honor to be named in the same category as those guys," Pujols said.	Good-luck charm Allen Craig homered for St. Louis and Yadier Molina drove in four runs. The Cardinals broke it open by scoring four times in the fourth, three more in the fifth and four in the sixth.	Adrian Beltre kept mashing for the Texas, getting four hits and driving in four runs.	Pujols, however, showed exactly why he is the most prized free agent of all going into this winter.	The big slugger connected off Alexi Ogando in the sixth, hit a two-run drive off Mike Gonzalez in the seventh and tagged Darren Oliver for a solo shot with two outs in the ninth.	"When Pujols is at the plate, that's the first time he did damage. We fought back pretty good, the next thing you know he's up there batting with guys on base and brings them in," Oliver said. "That's what he does. That's why he's the hitter he is."	By the end, Rangers president Nolan Ryan was rubbing his forehead and it was hard to keep track of all the hits. Balls were rolling into the corners, sailing over the fence and going most everywhere.	In the seventh, a fan wearing a Rangers shirt threw a ball toward St. Louis left fielder Matt Holliday as he was preparing to catch a fly ball. The fan was led away by security.	Early in the game, it appeared Kulpa's call would be the focal point.	The Cardinals led 1-0 when Pujols led off the fourth with a single. Holliday followed with a perfect double-play ball, but was ruled safe by Kulpa at first. Replays clearly show part-time first baseman Mike Napoli caught second baseman Ian Kinsler's high toss and slapped a tag on Holliday before he reached the bag.	Kulpa said he thought Holliday beat the tag. The Rangers argued, to no avail.	"Well, he missed the play and I knew he missed the play when I went out there," Washington said.	After the game, Kulpa said: "I saw a replay when I walked off the field, and the tag was applied before his foot hit the bag."	The Cardinals quickly scored four times, helped when Napoli threw wide to the plate for an error that let two runs cross. Texas fans booed as replays of the bad call circulated -- they won't be happy to learn, either, that Kulpa was born, raised and lives in the St. Louis area.	"Has nothing to do with it," Kulpa said.	For the Cardinals, perhaps it was a little evening up, albeit many years later. The call came four days before the anniversary of umpire Don Denkinger's missed call at first base in the 1985 World Series that severely cost St. Louis.	Starters Kyle Lohse of St. Louis and Matt Harrison were both pulled in the fourth inning. Soon after, it was clear that no pitchers were going to be too effective.	Lance Lynn earned the win with 2 1/3 innings of relief and Harrison took the loss.	Game notes	 La Russa earned his 68th postseason victory. He moved ahead of Bobby Cox into second place. Joe Torre leads with 84. ... Mavericks star Dirk Nowitzki threw out the first ball. The 7-foot Nowitzki fired a fastball from the mound that Young scooped. There has never been a 7-foot major leaguer, though 7-1 pitcher Loek Van Mil is in the Angels' system.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- So close to a World Series shutout, Derek Holland did everything he could, trying to convince Texas manager Ron Washington to let him finish.	There they stood on the mound, two outs to go in the ninth inning, the pitcher pleading his case as the crowd chanted his name.	"He was begging," Washington said. Or, as Rangers second baseman Ian Kinsler described it: "A lot of profanity, we sounded like sailors out there."	Washington listened, then signaled for closer Neftali Feliz. Holland had done his job in Game 4, and then some. He had kept Albert Pujols in the ballpark and the Rangers in this Series.	In a title matchup that's getting more interesting with every game, Holland put the emphasis back on pitching. Given a pep talk by Washington minutes before the game, Holland threw two-hit ball for 8 1/3 innings to beat the St. Louis Cardinals 4-0 on Sunday night and even things at 2-all.	Holland struck out seven, walked two and never was in trouble against a team that erupted for 16 runs the previous night. He came within two outs of pitching the first complete-game shutout in the World Series since Josh Beckett's gem for Florida to clinch the 2003 title at Yankee Stadium.	"I was very focused. I knew this was a big game for us," said Holland, who was 16-5 with 3.95 ERA and four shutouts in the regular season. "I had to step up and make sure I was prepared."	Hobbled Josh Hamilton put Texas ahead with an RBI double in the first inning. Then Mike Napoli broke it open with a three-run homer in the sixth that set off a hearty high-five in the front row between team president Nolan Ryan and former President George W. Bush.	And just like that, for the first time since 2003, the World Series stood at two games apiece. Now the whole season is down to a best of three, with the outcome to be decided back at Busch Stadium.	Game 5 is Monday night at Rangers Ballpark. It's a rematch of the opener, when Cardinals ace Chris Carpenter topped C.J. Wilson.	A day after Pujols produced arguably the greatest hitting show in postseason history, tying Series records with three home runs, six RBIs and five hits during the Cardinals' romp, Holland emerged as the unlikely star.	Holland got a big cheer when he took the mound in the ninth and was still throwing 96 mph. After he walked Rafael Furcal with one out, Washington strolled to the mound.	"I was begging to stay out there," Holland said. "I said, 'I'll give it everything I've got. I can get the double play.'	"When I came off the field my arm hair was sticking up -- not like I have much."	Holland tipped his cap and waved to the fans as he walked off. His outing was the longest scoreless appearance by an AL starter in the Series since Andy Pettitte also went 8 1/3 at Atlanta in 1996.	Feliz took over and closed. He walked Allen Craig, then retired Pujols on a fly ball and struck out Matt Holliday to end it.	Pujols finished 0 for 4 and hit the ball out of the infield only once.	"I wanted him to see my 'A' game," Holland said.	Said Cardinals manager Tony La Russa: "Well, I would just say	he worked us over. Give him credit."	"Good pitching is always going to stop good hitting," he said.	Holland was in tune all evening with Napoli, his pal and catcher. Much better than the battery for the pregame ceremony -- Bush tossed a wild pitch that glanced off the catcher's mitt Ryan wore.	"I should've gone with the regular glove," Ryan said with a chuckle.	The bounce-back Rangers managed to avoid consecutive losses for the first time since Aug. 23-25, a streak that's kept them out of trouble in the postseason.	The Rangers also completed a Sunday sweep in the matchup of teams from St. Louis and the Dallas area. Earlier in the afternoon, the Cowboys beat the Rams 34-7 right across the parking lots. Hamilton and Lance Berkman served as honorary captains for the pregame coin toss, wearing their baseball uniforms.	Many fans might remember Holland from last year's World Series. He's the reliever who came in against San Francisco, walked his first three batters and promptly got pulled.	Maybe that guy was an impostor. Because this 25-year-old lefty with the sorry little mustache was completely poised, with pinpoint control. Perhaps it was the talk he got from Washington near the dugout shortly before taking the mound.	Washington put both hands on Holland's shoulders and talked to him tenderly, like a dad about to send his teenage son off to college. Holland kept nodding, and Washington finished up with a playful pat to Holland's cheek.	"It was just a general message that he's capable of going out there and keeping us in the ballgame. That's all it was," Washington said. "I talk with Derek like that all the time, it just happened to catch me on TV."	Added Holland: "He shows that he cares about all his players, and he definitely showed that when he talked to me."	After that, Holland was in total command in his first Series start, and improved to 3-0 lifetime in the postseason. The only hits he allowed were by Berkman: a double in the second and a single in the fifth. Holland got even later, getting Berkman to look at a strike three that left the St. Louis star discussing the call with plate umpire Ron Kulpa.	Cardinals starter Edwin Jackson kept his team close despite a wild night. He walked seven, and eventually they caught up with him.	It was 1-0 when La Russa yanked Jackson after two one-out walks in the sixth and signaled for reliever Mitchell Boggs. Napoli was up, and the sellout crowd chanted his name as he stepped into the	batter's box.	Boggs stayed in the stretch for an extra beat while Furcal ducked behind Nelson Cruz from shortstop. When Boggs finally threw a 95 mph fastball with his first pitch, Napoli whacked it.	Napoli stood at the plate for a moment as the ball sailed deep, just inside the left field line. Boggs could only contort his body, seeing the game get out of hand.	Hamilton forced the Cardinals to play catch-up for the first time in a while. St. Louis had scored first in 10 straight postseason games, one shy of the record set by Detroit during a span from 1972-84.	Elvis Andrus singled with one out in the Texas first and sped home when Hamilton doubled into the right field corner. The reigning AL MVP has been slowed by a strained groin, part of the reason he hasn't homered in 57 at-bats this postseason.	Game notes	Napoli became the first catcher to hit two homers in a	Series since Mike Piazza of the Mets in 2000. ... Kinsler and St.	Louis C Yadier Molina played a little game of back-and-forth in the	second. Kinsler robbed Molina of an RBI single with a nice stop up	the middle to end the top half. In the bottom half, Molina made a	snap throw that trapped Kinsler off first base for the last out.	... Mitch Moreland batted last for Texas. It's the sixth time a	starting first baseman in the World Series had hit ninth in order,	four by Moreland.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Call it lucky, weird or just plain goofy. Whatever, Mike Napoli and the Texas Rangers are suddenly one win away from their first World Series championship.	And the St. Louis Cardinals? Perhaps next time they should try texting the bullpen.	In a Game 5 that took several odd twists at the end, Texas turned a grounder that got away and a telephone mix-up into its biggest victory ever. Napoli delivered the latest clutch hit of his charmed season, lining a tiebreaking two-run double in the eighth inning that sent the Rangers past St. Louis 4-2 on Monday night for a 3-2 edge.	Next up for Texas, a trip to St. Louis and a chance to capture that elusive crown.	"We certainly won't be out there thinking about we've just got to win one game," Texas manager Ron Washington said. "I've been there before, and that doesn't work."	Napoli's go-ahead stroke came off Marc Rzepczynski, right after a potential double-play ball slipped away from the St. Louis reliever. More bruising, at least to the Cardinals: Rzepczynski wasn't even supposed to face Napoli.	Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said he called down to the bullpen earlier in the inning and wanted Rzepczynski and closer Jason Motte to get ready. Instead, bullpen coach Derek Lilliquist heard only Rzepczynski at first. La Russa called again to ask for Motte and this time Lilliquist heard "Lynn," as in reliever Lance Lynn.	"I was more frustrated the double-play ball went off the glove and the fact we had numerous chances to add runs. That's probably more frustrating," La Russa said.	"The other part just happens. I mean, it's loud down there, and sometimes you call down there and you have to wait until the crowd and a guy gets up late. I mean, this is not unusual," he said.	Said Lilliquist: "You get a bunch of people, and it's loud."	"He wanted Motte going easy to back Zep up and I thought I heard Lynn. It transpired from there," he said. "It's basically miscommunication. It was loud. A lot of places are like that. The phone is as good as any phone anywhere."	The right-handed Napoli, meanwhile, was dialed in to face the left-handed Rzepczynski with the bases loaded, one out and the score 2-all.	"I didn't really see anybody warming up in the bullpen, so I kind of figured I was going to face him," Napoli said.	"Just trying to get something to the outfield, you know, get a sac fly, get that run across the board," he said. "I was trying to stay short and I got a pitch I could handle over the middle of the plate and put it in the gap."	Texas will try to wrap it up in Game 6 on Wednesday night in St. Louis, with Colby Lewis facing Jaime Garcia. The weather forecast for Busch Stadium is daunting, calling for rain and temperatures around 50.	After Napoli put Texas ahead, the slugging catcher capped off his night of double duty by throwing out a would-be base stealer in the ninth as Albert Pujols struck out.	"Pujols is going to put it in play, he's a good contact hitter," Napoli said, "and they were just starting the runner, 3-2. As soon as I got it, I just got rid of it and put it on the bag."	In the seventh, Napoli threw out Allen Craig at second with Pujols at the plate. Apparently, Pujols put on his own hit-and-run, then didn't swing.	If the Rangers eventually do win it all, the Texas fans who stood and chanted Napoli's name may forever remember his two-run hit.	If the Cardinals lose, there's no doubt which play will stick with La Russa for a long, long time.	It was tied when Texas put runners on first and second with one out in the eighth, and Rzepczynski was summoned. David Murphy followed with a bouncer back to the mound, a possible inning-ending double play in the making.	But the ball appeared to glance off Rzepczynski's hand and trickled harmlessly away for a single that loaded the bases. In the dugout, La Russa immediately threw his hands to his head, a true "Oh, no!" moment.	Napoli, who came close to a three-run homer in his previous at-bat and hit a big homer in a Game 4 win, sent a drive up the alley against the pitcher with the nickname "Scrabble." The double off Rzepczynski sure spelled good things for Texas, with the excitable Washington waving the runners around from the dugout.	Darren Oliver earned the win and Neftali Feliz closed for his second save of the Series and sixth of the postseason.	Adrian Beltre and Mitch Moreland hit solo home runs off Cardinals ace Chris Carpenter, helping Texas come back from an early 2-0 deficit.	Later, it became a battle of the bullpens and Texas prevailed.	Octavio Dotel gave up a leadoff double to Young in the eighth, struck out Beltre and intentionally walked Nelson Cruz. That left it up to Rzepczynski, and the game quickly slipped away.	La Russa appeared stunned by the turnaround. Later in the eighth, because of the mix-up, he brought in Lynn and had him issue an intentional walk to the only batter he faced. Motte eventually ended the inning, but it was too late.	Fittingly, Napoli had a role in the final play. Lance Berkman struck out and the ball hit Napoli's shin guard and trickled up the first base line, where the catcher picked it up and tossed to first base to end the game.	Pujols drew three intentional walks, including a pass with two outs and none on in the seventh. The St. Louis slugger then nearly used his legs to put his team ahead.	Pujols was running hard on a 3-2 pitch that Matt Holliday hit for a single to left-center. Pujols chugged around the bags and third base coach Jose Oquendo initially waved him home, only to put up a late stop sign.	Would Pujols have been safe on shortstop Elvis Andrus' wide throw to the plate? Maybe. But it became moot when Berkman was intentionally walked to load the bases and David Freese flied out against Alexi Ogando.	Beltre's homer made it 2-all with two outs in the sixth. He dropped to one knee after following through on a meaty cut. He connected on a big curve from Carpenter, who had easily handled Josh Hamilton and Young to start the inning.	Beltre's other homers this October came in a bunch. He hit three in a first-round playoff game at Tampa Bay.	Napoli almost gave Texas a cushion later in the inning. With the crowd standing and chanting his name as "Nap-Oh-Lee" flashed on the scoreboard, the catcher's bid for a three-run homer was caught on the warning track in right-center field, just shy of the 407-foot mark.	The homer let Texas ace C.J. Wilson avoid becoming the first pitcher to lose four times in a single postseason. The eccentric lefty who alternates red and blue gloves between starts had another uneven outing, working around five walks.	Wilson walked six while losing Game 1 to Carpenter and the Cardinals.	Moreland atoned for some glove woes with a home run in the third, hitting a drive halfway up the second deck in right field.	The Cardinals scored twice in the second, cashing in two leadoff walks sandwiched around a wild pitch.	Yadier Molina notched his fifth RBI of the Series with a single that left fielder Murphy overran and fumbled for an error. Skip Schumaker followed with an RBI grounder to first that Moreland boxed around, preventing any chance at a double play.	Game notes	Playing on his 34th birthday, Rafael Furcal led off the game with a liner that 3B Beltre backhanded. Furcal started Game 4 the same way. ... Wilson matched the postseason record for walks -- 19 -- set by Cleveland's Jaret Wright in 1997. Wilson's 11 walks in the World Series are the most since Allie Reynolds in 1951. ... Pujols flied out on a 3-0 pitch to end the first. He swung at 15 of 37 pitches on 3-0 counts this season, going 4 for 8 on the balls he put in play. ... Cardinals reliever Arthur Rhodes turned 42. He's the oldest player to celebrate a birthday while playing in the Series. Jim Palmer was 38 in 1983.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

ST. LOUIS --  By the time David Freese stomped on home plate Game 6 had already been stamped among the greatest thrillers in baseball history.	Twice down to their last strike, the St. Louis Cardinals somehow rallied.	And when Freese completed a startling series of comebacks with a leadoff home run in the bottom of the 11th inning to beat Texas 10-9 on Thursday night, fans all over got ready to enjoy something they hadn't seen in a long time: Game 7 of the World Series.	"You had to be here to believe it," Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said.	It was as great a game as the sport has ever witnessed, rivaling the Carlton Fisk homer in Game 6 of the 1975 Series and Bill Buckner's error in Game 6 of the 1986 Series.	Freese saved St. Louis with a two-strike, two-out, two-run triple off Rangers closer Neftali Feliz that tied it in the ninth. In the 10th, after Josh Hamilton had homered to give Texas a two-run lead, Lance Berkman's two-strike, two-out single made it 9-all.	To Freese, who grew up in the St. Louis area, it all reminded him of a game-ending home run Jim Edmonds hit in the 2004 playoffs.	"Growing up or whatever, and you see stuff like that happen, those become memories," Freese said.	Great, that is, except for Texas. The Rangers were that close to winning their first championship.	"I understand it's not over till you get that last out," Texas manager Ron Washington said. "I was just sitting there praying we got that last out. We didn't get it."	This was just the third time that a team one out from elimination in the World Series came back to win the game, according to STATS LLC. The New York Mets did it with Buckner's mistake and wound up winning the championship. In 1911, the New York Giants rallied past the Philadelphia A's in Game 5, but lost the next game.	Next up on Friday night, the first Game 7 in the World Series since the Angels beat San Francisco in 2002.	After it was over, La Russa wasn't willing to announce his starter for Game 7 -- many believe it will be ace Chris Carpenter on three days' rest. Matt Harrison is set to start for Texas.	Home teams have won the last eight Game 7s in the World Series, a streak that started with the Cardinals beating Milwaukee in 1982.	"There is tomorrow, now, for us," Cardinals star Albert Pujols said.	Freese had already written himself into St. Louis lore with the tying triple.	"Initially I was like 'Are you kidding me? My first AB off Feliz in this situation ever,'" Freese said. "I just beared down, got a pitch to hit. Initially I thought I hit it pretty good, I thought (right fielder Nelson Cruz) was going to grab it, so just a lot of emotions on that one."	After the banged-up Hamilton's two-run homer in the 10th, St. Louis again tied it when Berkman hit a two-out single on a 2-2 pitch from Scott Feldman.	"I was one strike away," Feldman said. "That pitch there, I didn't quite get it in enough and he was able to get enough of the bat on it to knock it into center field."	Busch Stadium was still in a frenzy when Freese opened the 11th with a leadoff shot over the center field wall off Mark Lowe. Freese thrust his arm in the air as he rounded first base, and the crowd was delirious.	"Just an incredible feeling, seeing all my teammates at the dish waiting for me," said Freese, whose shirt was torn off during the celebration.	Texas trudged off the field as Freese circled the bases, having been so close to that elusive title. Much earlier, team president Nolan Ryan was high-fiving friends in the stands as Adrian Beltre and Cruz opened the seventh with home runs that helped Texas take a 7-4 lead.	"I'm not going to lose any sleep over it," Hamilton said. "We're just going to do everything we can to prepare. Guys are already talking about it. We're ready for Game 7. Shake it off and come back tomorrow. That's just our mentality. But it goes both ways. Seems like they had that mentality. too."	Allen Craig's solo homer in the eighth began the Cardinals' comeback. Jake Westbrook wound up with the win.	Hardly the ending anyone imagined in a game that started out with a bevy of errors and bobbles -- none more surprising than the routine popup that Freese simply dropped at third base.	"I'm just glad I had a chance after I looked like an idiot on that popup," Freese said.	The Cardinals made it 4-all in the sixth when Alexi Ogando relieved starter Colby Lewis and walked Yadier Molina with the bases loaded.	Then came a key play -- Napoli and Beltre teamed up to pick off Matt Holliday at third with the bases loaded.	With one out, Napoli zipped a throw to Beltre, who neatly used his cleat to block the diving Holliday from reaching the base. That also ended Holliday's night with a severely bruised right pinkie.	Texas wasn't quite out of trouble as Nick Punto walked to reload the bases. But Derek Holland, the star of Game 4 with shutout ball into the ninth inning, trotted in from the bullpen and retired Jon Jay on a comebacker.	Texas and St. Louis seemed tense early, as if they were trying too hard with so much at stake. Either that, or they looked like they were playing in the sloppy weather that forced Wednesday night's postponement.	Exacerbated by the errors, the teams seesawed through the early innings.	Texas did more damage in three batters against Jaime Garcia than it did in seven scoreless innings against him in Game 2, with Hamilton hitting an RBI single in the first.	St. Louis came out swinging at first pitches, and Berkman's two-run homer into the center field bleachers made it 2-1 in the bottom half. Ian Kinsler tied it in the Texas second with an RBI double. Garcia was pulled after the third in his shortest outing since June 2010.	Shaky in the field all year, St. Louis made two errors in a span of four batters in the fourth behind reliever Fernando Salas, equaling its mistake total for the Series.	The misplays continued in the Cards fourth when first baseman Michael Young made an errant throw to Lewis covering the base, letting Berkman reach. Molina's RBI grounder made it 3-all.	The next botch was Freese's drop and Young took advantage with an RBI double for a 4-3 lead.

ST. LOUIS --  Albert Pujols thrust both arms high in the air, even before he reached home plate.	It was only the first inning, and already it felt as if the St. Louis Cardinals were home free. Because after they had overcome so much just to get this far, what could stop them?	The Cardinals won a remarkable World Series they weren't even supposed to reach, beating the Texas Rangers 6-2 in Game 7 on Friday night with another key hit by hometown star David Freese and six gutty innings from Chris Carpenter.	Pushed to the brink, the Cardinals kept saving themselves. A frantic rush to reach the postseason on the final day. A nifty pair of comebacks in the playoffs. Two desperate rallies in Game 6.	"This whole ride, this team deserves this," said Freese, who added the Series MVP award to his trophy as the NL championship MVP.	A day after an epic game that saw them twice within one strike of elimination before winning 10-9 in 11 innings, the Cardinals captured their 11th World Series crown.	"It's hard to explain how this happened," Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said.	Following a whole fall on the edge, including a surge from 10½ games down in the wild-card race, La Russa's team didn't dare mess with Texas, or any more drama in baseball's first World Series Game 7 since the Angels beat Giants in 2002.	Freese's two-run double tied it in the first, with Pujols celebrating as he scored. Good-luck charm Allen Craig hit a go-ahead homer in the third.	Given a chance to pitch by a Game 6 rainout and picked by La Russa earlier in the day to start on three days' rest, Carpenter and the tireless St. Louis bullpen closed it out.	No Rally Squirrel needed on this night, either. Fireworks and confetti rang out at Busch Stadium when Jason Motte retired David Murphy on a fly ball to end it.	"We just kept playing," Cardinals star Lance Berkman said.	Said La Russa: "If you watch the history of baseball, teams come back."	The Rangers, meanwhile, will spend the whole winter wondering how it all got away. Texas might dwell on it forever, in fact, or at least until Nolan Ryan & Co. can reverse a World Series slide that started with last year's five-game wipeout against San Francisco.	"We were close. Two times. Game 6. That's it," Texas pitcher Colby Lewis said.	Ryan left tightlipped. When a reporter tried to ask the Rangers president and part-owner a question, someone in his entourage said: "He's not talking."	Texas had not lost consecutive games since August. These two defeats at Busch Stadium cost manager Ron Washington and the Rangers a chance to win their first title in the franchise's 51-year history.	Instead, Texas became the first team to lose the Series two straight years since Atlanta in 1991-92.	"Sometimes when opportunity is in your presence, you certainly can't let it get away because sometimes it takes a while before it comes back," Washington said. "If there's one thing that happened in this World Series that I'll look back on is being so close, just having one pitch to be made and one out to be gotten, and it could have been a different story."	Added Texas third baseman Adrian Beltre: "We tried to come back today, but the momentum just took them.	"It's not a nice feeling, you know, being one strike away twice. I guess it's probably easier to lose four games in a row in a World Series, but being a strike away it's something that will be hard to forget."	This marked the ninth straight time the home team had won Game 7 in the World Series. The wild-card Cardinals held that advantage over the AL West champions because the NL won the All-Star Game -- Texas could blame that on their own pitcher, C.J. Wilson, who took the loss in July.	A year full of inspiring rallies and epic collapses was encapsulated in Game 6. Freese was the star, with a tying triple in the ninth and a winning home run in the 11th. His two RBIs in the clincher gave him a postseason record 21.	The Cardinals won their first championship since 2006, and gave La Russa his third World Series title. They got there by beating Philadelphia in the first round of the NL playoffs, capped by Carpenter outdueling Roy Halladay 1-0 in the deciding Game 5, and then topping Milwaukee in the NL championship series.	"I think the last month of the season, that's where it started," Pujols said. "Different guys were coming huge, getting big hits, and we carried that into the postseason and here we are, world champions."	By the time Yadier Molina drew a bases-loaded walk from starter Matt Harrison and Rafael Furcal was hit by a pitch from Wilson in relief, the crowd began to sense a championship was near.	The Cardinals improved to 8-3 in Game 7s of the Series, more wins than any other club. Yet fans here know their history well, and were aware this game could go either way -- Dizzy Dean and the Gas House Gang won 11-0 in 1934, but Whitey Herzog and his Cardinals lost 11-0 in 1985.	On this evening, all the stars aligned for St. Louis.	Starting in place of injured Matt Holliday, Craig hit his third homer of the Series and made a leaping catch at the top of the left field wall. Molina made another strong throw to nail a stray runner. And Carpenter steeled himself to pitch into the seventh, every bit an ace.	"It was in our grasp and we didn't get it," Washington said, referring to Game 6. "Tonight we fought hard for it and the Cardinals got it."	Pujols went 0 for 2, walked and was hit by a pitch in what could have been his last game with the Cardinals. Many think the soon-to-be free agent will remain in St. Louis.	"You know what? I'm not even thinking about that. I'm thinking about, you know, we're the world champions and I'm going to celebrate and whenever that time comes, you know, then we'll deal with it," he said.	Pujols did plenty of damage. His three-homer job in Game 3 was the signature performance of his career and perhaps the greatest hitting show in postseason history.	Dismissed by some as a dull Series even before it began because it lacked the big-market glamour teams, it got better inning by inning. Plus, a postseason first: A bullpen telephone mixup played a prominent role.	"I told you it was going to be a great series, and it was," Texas slugger Josh Hamilton said.	"I don't care what other people remember. We fell a little bit short. Hats off to the Cards, they did a great job, especially last night. It was actually fun to watch and fun to see. You hate it but it happened."	Craig hit a solo home run in the third, an opposite field fly to right that carried into the Cardinals bullpen and got their relievers dancing. The super-sub put St. Louis ahead 3-2 with his third homer of the Series. He was in the lineup only because Holliday sprained his right wrist on a pickoff play a night earlier and was replaced on the roster.	By then, the largest crowd at 6-year-old Busch Stadium was buzzing. The fans seemed a bit drained much earlier, maybe worn out from the previous night.	They grew hush in the first when Hamilton and Michael Young hit consecutive RBI doubles. Texas might have gotten more, but Ian Kinsler strayed too far off first base and was trapped by Molina's rocket throw.	Freese changed the mood in a hurry as St. Louis tied it in the bottom half. Pujols and Lance Berkman drew two-out walks and pitching coach Mike Maddux trotted to the mound while Freese stepped in to a standing ovation.	Freese rewarded his family and a ballpark full of new friends by lining a full-count floater to the wall in left center for a two-run double. Harrison was in trouble, and Wilson began warming up after only 23 pitches.	Carpenter wasn't sharp at the outset, either. All over the strike zone, he started seven of the first 10 batters with balls. Pitching coach Dave Duncan made a visit in the second to check on the tall righty, lingering for a few extra words.	"I was hoping to have an opportunity to go ahead and pitch in that game and fortunately it worked out," Carpenter said. "It started off a little rough in the first. But I was able to collect myself, make some pitches and our guys did an awesome job to battle back. And I mean, it's just amazing."	Game notes	 Texas set a Series record by walking 41 batters, one more than Florida in 1997. Of the 34 runs the Cardinals scored, 11 reached on walks and two more on hit batters. ... The crowd was 47,399. ... The Cardinals will play the first game of the 2012 season in North America, opening the Miami Marlins' new ballpark on April 4.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.
