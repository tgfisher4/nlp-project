Gerrit Cole is elated after the Astros eliminate the Rays in Game 5 and recaps the difficult series. (1:16)	HOUSTON --  All season long, it seemed inevitable.	Yankees-Astros for the American League pennant.	"It's the matchup that we wanted," Houston shortstop Carlos Correa said. "It's the matchup that everybody wants to watch. It's must-see TV right there. So everybody is going to be tuning in. It's going to be fun."	Houston made it happen Thursday night as Gerrit Cole pitched another playoff masterpiece and the Astros jumped to a quick lead, turning back the Tampa Bay Rays 6-1 in the deciding Game 5 of their AL Division Series.	On deck, the heavyweight matchup so many fans were anticipating: Jose Altuve and the 107-win Astros against Aaron Judge and the 103-win Yankees. Game 1 is Saturday night in Houston -- the Astros won four of seven meetings this season.	"This is two incredible powerhouse teams," Houston ace Justin Verlander said. "We'll find ourselves in the middle of the ring here in a couple of days and we'll be going at it."	After fellow aces Zack Greinke and Verlander were unable to close out the scrappy Rays on the road, Cole made sure Houston moved on. Given a 4-0 cushion in the first inning, he dominated through the eighth, striking out 10 and allowing just two hits.	"I'm just going to treat it like it's the next game, man," said Cole, who grew up a Yankees fan. "I mean, we know that they're obviously very talented, and it's going to be a dogfight."	Michael Brantley and Altuve put the finishing touches on this victory, hitting back-to-back home runs in the eighth. The Astros advanced to their third straight ALCS, and are aiming for their second World Series crown in that span.	Houston beat the Yankees in a seven-game ALCS on the way to its first championship in 2017. The Astros also won the 2015 AL wild-card game at Yankee Stadium.	The Rays beat Oakland in the AL wild-card game, then won Games 3 and 4 against the Astros to extend their first playoff run since 2013.	But facing Cole, the Rays were in trouble -- especially after Altuve, Alex Bregman and the Astros scored four times in the first against Tyler Glasnow, who said afterward it was pretty obvious he was tipping pitches.	"You get a taste of this, you want to keep going," Rays manager Kevin Cash said. "Today we kind of got outpowered. Outpowered on the mound and obviously at the plate."	Cole followed his 15-strikeout gem in a Game 2 win with another overpowering effort. The right-hander, who was drafted by the Yankees out of high school but didn't sign, improved to 18-0 in his last 24 starts.	"This team is special, and the reason that we're special is because different guys step up every single night," Bregman said. "Yeah, if one guy goes off we're probably going to win. Gerrit went off twice this series."	Cole topped the majors with 326 strikeouts this season, led the AL with a 2.50 ERA and posted 20 wins, one behind Verlander for most in the big leagues. He tried to stick to what got him this far and not alter his approach on Thursday night even though the stakes were so much higher.	"You're not naive to the situation you're in, but you can't afford to treat it any different," he said.	The 29-year-old struck out the first two batters in the eighth before Willy Adames grounded out to end Cole's night.	"I don't know if anybody can get better than that," Adames said. "He was unbelievable last start, and today was still the same."	Cole beat his chest once before walking to the dugout to a huge ovation from the rowdy sellout crowd of 43,418 at Minute Maid Park.	"Energy was so great all night," Cole said. "They deserved a hat tip."	After winning an MLB-best and franchise-record 107 games in the regular season, the Astros were determined not to suffer the same fate as the Dodgers, winners of 106 games, who were ousted from the playoffs by the wild-card Nationals on Wednesday night.	Houston had been outscored 14-4 in the last two games, but looked sharp at home, where it went 60-21 in the regular season.	A day after the Cardinals scored a postseason-record 10 runs in the first inning of a 13-1 win over the Braves, the Astros scored four runs fast. Now it wasn't nearly as big as what St. Louis did, but after the Astros were shut down at Tropicana Field, it was just as huge for them.	"It shows a lot of character," Houston general manager Jeff Luhnow said. "Because if we hadn't gotten up early I think it would have been a different ballgame the way they have their relievers lined up and ready to go. I'm glad it wasn't a one-run game. Getting four early mattered a lot."	The Astros will make their seventh appearance in an LCS and are the first team to reach the ALCS three seasons in a row since the Detroit Tigers did it from 2011-13.	Altuve's shot gave him 11 postseason homers to pass Chase Utley for most all-time by a second baseman.	Cole extended his major league record by striking out at least 10 batters for the 11th straight game, a stretch where he's fanned 135.	Cole pitched a 1-2-3 third but didn't strike anyone out in the frame, ending a streak of 73 consecutive innings with at least one strikeout. The streak, which dated back to Aug. 1, was the longest such streak since 1961, besting the second-best stretch by 33 innings.	George Springer and Brantley hit back-to-back singles and Altuve's single made it 1-0. Bregman's double, which landed just in front of the bullpen in right-center, scored two more to push the lead to 3-0.	Yuli Gurriel's groundball single to left field added another. Houston's five hits and four runs set franchise playoff records for most hits and runs in the first inning.	Eric Sogard hit a solo homer in the Tampa Bay second in his first start in almost a month while dealing with a foot injury. But Tampa Bay managed only a single by Ji-Man Choi in the fourth and a walk by Travis d'Arnaud to start the seventh against Cole.	Roberto Osuna pitched a hitless ninth to finish off the win.	Cash had said he thought Glasnow could throw about 90 pitches in this one, but he'd seen enough of the big right-hander after 40 pitches and lifted him with two outs in the third for Blake Snell.	Snell, the 2018 AL Cy Young Award winner, got the next four outs in his second career relief appearance after getting the save in Game 4. The Rays wound up using nine pitchers.

ST. LOUIS --  It turns out Washington's Big Three is a Big Four.	Don't forget about Anibal Sanchez.	The right-hander carried a no-hit bid into the eighth inning, Howie Kendrick had two more big swings and the Nationals beat the St. Louis Cardinals 2-0 on Friday night in the NL Championship Series opener.	"Tonight was obviously vintage Anibal," first baseman Ryan Zimmerman said.	Sanchez had allowed just three runners when he took the mound for the eighth. Zimmerman robbed Tommy Edman with an outstanding diving grab at full stretch for the first out, but pinch-hitter Jose Martinez cleanly singled to center with two down for the Cardinals' first hit.	"I just tried to keep focused on every pitch that I'm going to throw," Sanchez said. "I don't want to miss any kind of pitch in the middle in the zone against those guys."	Sanchez thought he was going to finish the no-hitter after the big grab.	"When Zimmerman caught the ball I said, `OK, I've got it," the pitcher recalled.	Sean Doolittle relieved and got four straight outs to finish the one-hitter for his first postseason save in two years.	Sanchez and Doolittle made life easy on manager Dave Martinez after the Nationals placed closer Daniel Hudson on the paternity list before the franchise's first appearance in the NLCS since the Montreal Expos moved to Washington ahead of the 2005 season.	"I think the mood of the guys in the bullpen, we really wanted to find a way to pick him up and allow him to enjoy a really special moment with his wife and his family," Doolittle said.	Game 2 is back at Busch Stadium on Saturday. Washington ace Max Scherzer starts in his hometown, and Adam Wainwright gets the ball for St. Louis. Stephen Strasburg and Patrick Corbin will follow when the series moves to Nationals Park.	"People were talking about the Big Three," Cardinals manager Mike Shildt said, "but we got a guy tonight that we got to contend with and not overlook him."	St. Louis wasted a solid performance by Miles Mikolas, who pitched six innings of one-run ball in his second career playoff start.	Washington scored each of its runs with two outs. Kendrick doubled and came home on Yan Gomes' double in the second. Kendrick then singled in Adam Eaton in the seventh after Eaton reached on a one-out triple against Giovanny Gallegos.	Kendrick also had the big blow in Washington's Game 5 victory at Los Angeles on Wednesday night, a 10th-inning grand slam.	"It's going to be a fun series," Kendrick said. "Hopefully we can continue to play really good baseball and put up runs and get some wins."	Gomes finished with two hits while subbing for catcher Kurt Suzuki, who left the Nationals' clinching victory against the Dodgers with a head injury.	Sanchez became the first pitcher to start two postseason games with six hitless innings. Facing Boston for Detroit in the 2013 AL Championship Series opener, he was replaced by Al Alburquerque at the start of the seventh. The Tigers won 1-0, allowing their only hit when Daniel Nava singled off Joaquin Benoit with one out in the ninth.	Sanchez got his first playoff win since he struck out 12 in that game. He threw a no-hitter for the Florida Marlins in his 13th big league start as a rookie in 2006 and also has pitched four one-hitters.	He started this year 0-6 in his first nine starts but went 11-2 in his final 19.	For a while, it looked as if he might be headed to the third no-hitter in postseason history.	"He was good," Edman said. "He was just hitting his spots and keeping us off balance all night, and we just didn't execute our plan very well."	Sanchez retired his first 10 batters before Kolten Wong walked in the fourth on a chilly, breezy evening.	Wong stole second and took third on Gomes' throwing error, but Marcell Ozuna hit an inning-ending foulout.	Pinch-hitter Randy Arozarena was hit by a pitch with one out in the sixth, but the 35-year-old Sanchez retired Dexter Fowler and Wong. He plunked Yadier Molina in the seventh before Matt Carpenter bounced out.	"He was spot on with everything he threw today," Gomes said.	Sanchez struck out five in his ninth career postseason start. He threw 67 of 103 pitches for strikes.	WORTH REMEMBERING	Mikolas retired Juan Soto on a bouncer to second for the final out of the fifth, leaving the bases loaded. The pitcher then grabbed his crotch briefly in the direction of the slugger.	"To me it's not good," Soto said. "I don't care. He can do whatever he wants. We're going to keep going."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: Suzuki and OF Victor Robles (strained right hamstring) were out of the starting lineup after they got hurt in the Division Series. Dave Martinez said Robles is about 80 to 85 percent. "To me it's worth him missing another day or two to get him fully back, hopefully," he said.	UP NEXT	Scherzer struck out 10 while pitching eight innings of one-run ball against the Dodgers. Wainwright threw 7 2/3 scoreless innings in Game 3 of the NLDS against the Braves.	---	Jay Cohen can be reached at https://twitter.com/jcohenap	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

Nationals reliever Daniel Hudson explains how easy his choice was to be with his wife for the birth of their daughter. (0:53)	ST. LOUIS --  Max Scherzer was strength and fire. Aníbal Snchez was artistry and deception.	Two different styles, two absolute gems for the Washington Nationals.	Scherzer followed Sánchez's near no-hitter with a try of his own, and the stingy Nationals beat the St. Louis Cardinals 3-1 on Saturday for a 2-0 lead in the NL Championship Series.	"We really want to win here," the hard-charging Scherzer said. "So that's what's going to happen, we're going to compete and win."	Scherzer didn't allow a hit until Paul Goldschmidt led off the seventh inning with a single that left fielder Juan Soto played conservatively with a 1-0 lead. A day earlier, Sánchez held the Cardinals hitless until José Martínez had a pinch single with two down in the eighth.	Sánchez and Scherzer also began the 2013 ALCS with consecutive no-hit bids of at least five innings for Detroit against Boston. They are the only pitchers to accomplish the feat in postseason history.	"The way he can change speeds and execute pitches, it's a treat to really watch and get to pitch with him," Scherzer said. "For me, I'm just in the moment. I'm not trying to do anything great, I'm just trying to stick within my game."	Scherzer, a St. Louis native who played college ball for the University of Missouri, struck out 11 and walked two in seven innings.	It doesn't get any easier for St. Louis, either. Ace Stephen Strasburg gets the ball for the wild-card Nationals when the best-of-seven series moves to Washington for Game 3 on Monday night. Jack Flaherty pitches for the Cards.	"They have a pretty strong advantage right now," Cardinals right-hander Adam Wainwright said.	"I've got a lot of confidence in our hitters. I think our hitters are going to do something special in Washington."	St. Louis got another solid performance from Wainwright, who struck out 11 in 7 1/3 innings.	But after getting only one hit in the opener, the Cardinals' inconsistent lineup managed just three hits against Scherzer and the Washington bullpen.	"We trust in each other. We've been in this position before," Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina said. "We just have to figure out how to get better."	The NL Central champions got their first run of the series when center fielder Michael A. Taylor misplayed Martínez's pinch-hit liner into an RBI double with two outs in the eighth. But Dexter Fowler flied out on Sean Doolittle's next pitch on a tough day to see the ball with the shadows from the mid-afternoon start.	Patrick Corbin got the first out of the ninth before Daniel Hudson earned his third save of the playoffs. The right-hander was reinstated from the postseason paternity list before the game after he missed the series opener to be with his wife, Sara, for the birth of their third child, a girl named Millie.	Corbin is expected to start Game 4 for the Nationals on Tuesday night.	Scherzer, who has pitched two no-hitters in the regular season, has a record five career postseason no-hit bids of at least five innings, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. The three-time Cy Young Award winner came closest to finishing in Game 3 of the 2017 NL Division Series, getting one out in the seventh inning before allowing a hit.	There have only been two postseason no-hitters. Don Larsen threw a perfect game for the New York Yankees against Brooklyn in the 1956 World Series, and Roy Halladay pitched a no-hitter for the Philadelphia Phillies in the 2010 NL Division Series.	"It's a good ballclub, but we've got great pitchers," Taylor said. "They went out and executed pitch after pitch."	The Cardinals got one baserunner into scoring position while Scherzer was on the mound. Kolten Wong walked with one out in the first and stole second, but Goldschmidt and Marcell Ozuna struck out.	After Goldschmidt's hit, Ozuna struck out again and Molina bounced into an inning-ending double play on Scherzer's final pitch of the afternoon.	Washington went ahead to stay when Taylor homered on Wainwright's first pitch of the third. The Nationals added two more on Adam Eaton's double down the first-base line with one out in the eighth.	"This is really, it's not just one guy carrying this team or two guys," Scherzer said. "It's really just a collective of everybody out there doing their job."	ALL THOSE KS	It was the second postseason game in major league history in which each starter recorded more than 10 strikeouts. Jacob deGrom (13 Ks) and Clayton Kershaw (11 strikeouts) also accomplished the feat in Game 1 of the 2015 NLDS.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: C Kurt Suzuki returned to the starting lineup after being sidelined by a head injury. He got hurt by a foul ball that ricocheted during Washington's clinching victory in Game 5 of the NLDS against the Dodgers on Wednesday night. ... OF Victor Robles was out of the lineup again because of a strained right hamstring. He got hurt in Game 2 against Los Angeles.	UP NEXT	Flaherty struck out eight in six innings in St. Louis' 13-1 victory over Atlanta in Game 5 of the NL Division Series on Wednesday. The right-hander turns 24 on Tuesday.	Strasburg made two starts against St. Louis this season, going 1-0 with a 2.31 ERA. He has allowed four runs in 15 innings in the playoffs.	---	Jay Cohen can be reached at https://twitter.com/jcohenap	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

Alex Bregman criticizes the Astros' offense, saying the team has done nothing offensively in the postseason to support its starting pitchers. (0:39)	HOUSTON --  The youngest Baby Bomber is all grown up. Any surprise Gleyber Torres is doing so well in October?	"I mean, not really," he said.	The 22-year-old Torres kept up his postseason surge with a homer and five RBI, Masahiro Tanaka polished his playoff resume and the New York Yankees blanked the Houston Astros 7-0 Saturday night in the AL Championship Series opener.	Torres did his part in this matchup of 100-win behemoths with a go-ahead double, a solo homer, a two-run single and an RBI grounder. Moved up to third in the batting order after mashing in a sweep of Minnesota, the two-time All-Star became the youngest AL player to drive in five runs during a postseason game.	"Prepare really well to be here and help my team. So now I got opportunity," he said.	Brett Gardner, one of New York's older players at 35, raved about the young second baseman.	"It's kind of scary for opposing pitchers, but exciting if you're a Yankees fan," he said. "He's just so talented and has a knack for putting the bat on the baseball. No moment is too big for him."	With so much attention focused on the Astros aces, Tanaka showed he more than belonged on this stage, too. He threw one-hit ball for six innings to outpitch Zack Greinke, improving to 5-2 with a 1.32 ERA in the postseason.	Giancarlo Stanton and Gio Urshela also homered and right fielder Aaron Judge turned in the key play, catching a line drive and doubling Alex Bregman off first base when it was still 1-0.	"Loved our look today," manager Aaron Boone said.	The Yankees will try to build on their early momentum when James Paxton starts against 21-game winner Justin Verlander in Game 2 on Sunday night.	Houston hardly resembled a club that led the majors with a franchise-record 107 victories. Jose Altuve, Bregman and their teammates were held to three singles.	"I don't think we've really done anything offensively this postseason," Bregman said. "We need to string together some at-bats."	The Astros had homered in 30 straight games -- every game since Aug. 31 -- and their streak was the second-longest in major league history behind a 31-game string by the Yankees this year.	Greinke, acquired at the trade deadline for these kind of moments, produced another lackluster playoff start.	"The Yankees, they can come at you in a lot of different ways," Astros manager AJ Hinch said.	Tanaka, who won Game 1 of the ALDS, struck out four and walked one. He faced the minimum through six innings thanks to a pair of double plays. The 68 pitches he used to get through six innings are the fewest a pitcher needed to get through six in a postseason game since Atlanta's Greg Maddux threw 67 in six innings in the NLDS against the Giants in 2002. Three relievers finished up the shutout.	"Obviously the number's there and I guess I'm flattered. But the happiest thing for me is us being able to get the W," Tanaka said through a translator.	Torres picked up right where he left off in the division series where he hit .417 to lead the team -- he batted sixth in those games, but was moved higher as Boone tinkered with his lineup to break up the team's lefty hitters.	Torres put the Yankees out front with an RBI double in the fourth.	There was one out in the sixth when he hit a fastball from Greinke into the seats in left field. Greinke knew it was gone off the bat, and pounded his fist into his glove as soon as Torres left the batter's box.	Torres singled in the seventh to make it 5-0. He has an RBI in all four of New York's playoff games this year.	"He likes playing these situations and he's confident in his ability to produce. And that leads to a dangerous player," Boone said.	Stanton homered with two outs in the sixth.	The Astros and Yankees were meeting in the playoffs for the third time in five years and facing off in the ALCS for the second time in three seasons. New York's road win on Saturday night comes after the home team won every game of the 2017 ALCS that Houston took 4-3.	The Astros got Greinke, the 2009 AL Cy Young Award winner, from Arizona in July, hoping to bolster a rotation starring Verlander and Gerrit Cole. Greinke went 8-1 with a 3.02 ERA in 10 regular-season starts after the trade, but has struggled in the postseason and lost both starts.	He was put off when asked if he felt he had to pitch perfectly with no run support.	"I don't like that question," he said.	Greinke took the loss in Game 3 of the ALDS against Tampa Bay in allowing five hits, four of which were homers and six runs in 3 2/3 innings.	Urshela added a solo homer on rookie Bryan Abreu's first pitch of the postseason to pad the lead in the ninth. Torres drove in another run with a groundout later in the inning.	The Yankees led 1-0 when Bregman drew a leadoff walk in the fifth. Yordan Alvarez followed with a drive that Judge caught on run, and he made a strong throw that first baseman DJ LeMahieu scooped for the double play. Bregman stumbled a bit trying to get back and was nabbed.	"Being able to kind of shut down that inning was huge," Judge said. "I was excited about that."

HOUSTON --  In a battle of the bullpens, Carlos Correa felt the greatest relief.	Injured down the stretch and slumping this month, Correa hit a leadoff home run in the 11th inning that lifted the Houston Astros over the New York Yankees 3-2 Sunday night, tying the AL Championship Series at one game apiece.	Correa, who earlier lined an RBI double and made a sensational play at shortstop, connected for an opposite-field shot to right off J.A. Happ.	"Not playing a couple of weeks before the playoffs and then not producing for or my team offensively, obviously it's tough, getting hurt and everything," the All-Star said. "But it's all worth it for moments like this, moments like this where you give your team a chance to win every day, it's worth it, man."	Hours earlier, Correa was confident this would be the day he turned things around. About time, too, after starting out 3 for 22 in the postseason after returning from back problems.	"I've got my swing back," he said then. "I'm going to hit a homer tonight."	And with a swing that kept Houston from falling into an 0-2 hole, he did just that.	"Going into that last inning I thought: `I got this. I feel like I got this," Correa said. "And I had the right approach against him. I've been successful against him going the other way. And that's what I try to do, I saw a good pitch down the middle and I drove the other way."	Correa watched the ball sail, tossed his bat, put his hand to one ear to soak in the roars of the crowd and then held up one finger as he rounded the bases. As he approached home plate, he tossed his helmet as if shooting a basketball at the crowd of teammates waiting for him.	"As soon as I hit it I knew it was going to go over the fence," he said. "The adrenaline started pumping like crazy. I don't even know what I did. I've got to go watch the video. But I know I was so hyped."	Correa's big night gave him 27 RBI in the postseason to pass Lance Berkman for the most in franchise history. And it was a familiar scene -- in Game 2 of the 2017 ALCS against the Yankees, Correa hit a walk-off double in the ninth.	"You look at his RBI totals in the postseason, you look at his walk-offs, you look at the big moments, he's a pretty special man," manager AJ Hinch said.	Game 3 is Tuesday afternoon at Yankee Stadium. Gerrit Cole, who is 18-0 in his last 24 starts and led the majors in strikeouts, starts for the Astros against Luis Severino.	"The game of baseball, it's a beautiful game," Correa said.	The Yankees tied a League Championship Series record by using nine pitchers. The eight relievers had permitted only one run and two hits with 11 strikeouts in 7 2/3 innings before Correa homered, ending a game that took 4 hours, 49 minutes and finished just before midnight.	Houston's five relievers combined for 4 1/3 innings of one-hit shutout ball after taking over for Justin Verlander. Going into this best-of-seven series, the Yankees were considered the better team in the bullpen -- the Astros amply held their own in this one.	"Our bullpen was nasty, gave us a chance to win the game," Correa said.	Gary Sanchez struck out looking to end the Yankees 11th with runners on first and second. The pitch appeared outside -- it came right after he swung and missed with two strikes, but was ruled a foul ball.	New York lost for the first time this postseason after four wins.	"It was a struggle tonight," Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. "They're tough to score runs off, especially on a night when Verlander is out there."	Aaron Judge put the Yankees on top 2-1 with a two-run shot off Verlander in the fourth. It was his first homer this postseason and the eighth in his playoff career.	George Springer tied it in the fifth with his franchise-record 12th career postseason home run. The 2017 World Series MVP homered on the first pitch after reliever Adam Ottavino entered.	"Just back and forth -- the two best ballclubs in the game," Judge said. "I wish we could have come away with two here, but now time to regroup and get ready for Tuesday."	Along with his bat, Correa made the key play in the field to keep it tied at 2 in the sixth. With runners at first and second, and on the move on a full-count pitch with two outs, Brett Gardner hit a hard grounder that bounced off second baseman Jose Altuve for a single.	The ball bounded away and Correa quickly retrieved it and threw a strike to catcher Robinson Chirinos, who tagged out the sliding DJ LeMahieu.	Verlander pumped his fist and screamed "let's go!" as he came off the field and Correa shook his finger with a look that said: "not on my watch."	Cameras then panned to Verlander's supermodel wife, Kate Upton, who jumped and cheered from a luxury suite.	"I just tried creeping over and as soon as the ball hit him, I scooped it and he sent him, so I had to gun him down," Correa said.	Correa ended an 0-for-14 slump with an RBI double in the second off James Paxton, who lasted just 2 1/3 innings.	Hours later, Correa ended it with his drive off Happ. Correa is 6 for 12 with two homers against the lefty.	"It's been a tough road this year but I'm finally here and I was able to contribute tonight," he said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: Slugger Giancarlo Stanton missed the game with a strained right quad. He homered in the opener. "So hoping that it's something that with today and the off day, that he would be back in play for Game 3," Boone said.	UP NEXT	Cole was 2-0 with a 0.57 ERA and 25 strikeouts across 15 2/3 innings against the Rays in the ALDS. The 29-year-old led the AL with a career-best 2.50 ERA and was first in the majors with 326 strikeouts in the regular season.	This will be the eighth postseason start for Severino, who did not factor in the decision in New York's Game 3 win over Minnesota. Severino, who made just three regular-season starts because of a late injury, allowed four hits in four innings against the Twins.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

WASHINGTON --  More than 100 pitches in, Stephen Strasburg was adamant he wasn't quite ready to leave the latest superb start by a Nationals pitcher against the St. Louis Cardinals in the NL Championship Series -- a win that put Washington on the verge of the city's first World Series in 86 years.	It was the seventh inning, and manager Dave Martinez noticed Strasburg had flexed his right leg and reached for that hamstring. So the skipper and a trainer went to the mound to check on their guy.	"I was trying to explain to him, `Hey, you just grabbed your hamstring, so there's a little concern," Martinez recalled. "He said, `No, I cramped up. It's fine. I always cramp up.' He said, `I'm staying in the game. I want to finish this inning.' I said, `You sure you're all right?' He said, `I'm in the game!"	The right-hander did, indeed, stay in. Even struck out the next two batters to raise his total to 12 Ks, each finished with an off-speed pitch. Strasburg took his turn silencing the Cardinals' struggling bats, Nationals postseason star Howie Kendrick doubled three times and drove in three more runs, and Washington took a 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven NLCS by beating St. Louis 8-1 Monday night.	"It's a little surreal," reliever Sean Doolittle said about being one win from the World Series, "and I think that's why it's important that we don't look too far ahead."	After Nationals starters Anibal Sanchez and Max Scherzer flirted with no-hitters in the first two games against the Cardinals, Strasburg wasn't quite that untouchable: He allowed a double in the second inning, six later singles and one unearned run.	Still, the Cardinals, quite simply, can't score in this NLCS: They have a grand total of two runs and 11 hits through three games. Washington's three starters have a combined ERA -- no calculator necessary for this one -- of 0.00.	Yes, that's zero-point-zero-zero.	"We expected better," said Kolten Wong, who went 0 for 4 on Monday and is 0 for 10 in the series for St. Louis.	Now it's Patrick Corbin's chance to see if he can match his rotation-mates. The $140 million lefty will start for the Nationals in Game 4 on Tuesday night, when they can close out a sweep at home. Rookie right-hander Dakota Hudson will be on the mound for the Cardinals.	"We've got to get a lead at some point in this series. Hard to win a game if you can't get a lead," St. Louis manager Mike Shildt said. "We've got to figure out a way to create some offense early in the game and be able to hold it there."	Washington hasn't put a baseball team in the World Series since 1933, when the Senators lost to the New York Giants in five games. The nation's capital owns only one MLB championship; the Senators won all the way back in 1924. There wasn't even a baseball team at all in Washington for more than three decades until the Montreal Expos franchise moved to town before the 2005 season and was renamed the Nationals.	Until this season, the Nationals hadn't won a playoff series, going 0-4 since 2012, but they sure look as if they're making up for lost time.	"Shoot, maybe we're finally coming around," third baseman Anthony Rendon said.	How about this current run? The Nationals, who found themselves at 19-31 in late May, have won 15 of their past 17 games, stretching back to the last week of the regular season.	It all starts with the pitching.	"That's what our team is built around. You have those guys, those horses, that take the ball every fifth day," said Ryan Zimmerman, who drove in two runs. "They haven't disappointed, obviously, in the postseason, but they've kind of been the backbone of this team all year."	Against Sanchez in Game 1, the first hit for the Cardinals arrived with their 27th batter. Against Scherzer in Game 2, it was their 21st batter. But even when the Cardinals did something right against Strasburg, they erased it by doing something wrong.	Their fourth batter, Marcell Ozuna, doubled to the left field corner in the second, then quickly erased himself with some poor baserunning, going too far toward third on a comebacker and getting tagged out by Strasburg, who is enjoying a postseason to remember.	He was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2009 amateur draft, then was infamously shut down before the playoffs three years later to protect his surgically repaired right elbow. Strasburg is now hale and hearty, throwing 117 pitches Monday, his most since totaling 118 in a May 2017 game.	And this sort of October excellence is what the Nationals were hoping for: Strasburg has a 3-0 record and 1.64 ERA, with 33 strikeouts and one walk -- he didn't issue a free pass Monday -- in 22 innings this postseason.	Much to the delight of a red towel-twirling crowd of 43,675, Washington's batters kept delivering, led by Kendrick, who has eight RBI in the past four games.	The Nationals roughed up Jack Flaherty for four runs, all in the third inning; he hadn't allowed that many in a game since July 2, a span of 18 appearances.	Seven of Washington's eight runs came with two outs, and there were contributions from up and down the lineup: Victor Robles homered in his return from a hamstring injury, and Rendon heard "MVP!" chants after a slick defensive play and an RBI double.	"We haven't been able to play our brand of baseball in full," Shildt said. "We haven't been able to get in rhythm or sync, but we still have more baseball to play."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: Robles, the Nationals' center fielder, missed five postseason games with a strained right hamstring he hurt in Game 2 of the NLDS.	UP NEXT	Corbin took the loss in each of Washington's two defeats this postseason. One was a start -- in Game 1 of the NLDS, when he allowed just one unearned run with nine strikeouts -- and one came in relief. Corbin also came out of the bullpen to retire one Cardinals batter in Game 2 of the NLCS on Saturday.	In his only postseason start, in Game 4 of the Cardinals' NLDS against Atlanta, Hudson allowed one earned run in 4 2/3 innings and did not factor in the decision as St. Louis won 5-4 in 10 innings.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.

NEW YORK --  Game 4 of the AL Championship Series scheduled for Wednesday night has been postponed because of rain in the forecast.	The Houston Astros and New York Yankees will play Game 4 on Thursday night instead, with Game 5 on Friday at Yankee Stadium and Game 6 in Houston on Saturday if necessary. Houston beat New York 4-1 in the Bronx on Tuesday night to take a 2-1 series lead.	It's expected that Houston will start Zack Greinke against the Yankees' Masahiro Tanaka in a rematch of Game 1. Tanaka pitched six sterling innings as New York won the opener 7-0.	Both clubs had planned to use bullpen openers Wednesday, and the day off will be welcome for New York after manager Aaron Boone used five relievers to cover 4 2/3 innings Tuesday. Starter Luis Severino threw 36 pitches in the first inning and was pulled in the fifth. Boone deployed key arms Chad Green, Tommy Kahnle, Adam Ottavino and Zack Britton in the loss, although none threw more than 11 pitches.	Of course, now the teams might play the final four games without a day off, culminating in Game 7 on Sunday. With the Yankees leaning heavily on their bullpen this month, the starter-driven Astros could be at an advantage.	Greinke, a 2009 Cy Young Award winner acquired from Arizona at the July 31 trade deadline, has struggled through two starts this postseason. He allowed six runs and couldn't finish the fourth inning against Tampa Bay in Game 3 of the AL Division Series, and the Yankees hammered two homers and scored three runs against him in six innings in the ALCS opener.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

WASHINGTON --  As the Washington Nationals moved a party 86 years in the making from their ballpark's infield to a booze-filled clubhouse, manager Dave Martinez paused near the dugout and thrust the silver NL Championship Series trophy overhead, to the delight of loud, delirious fans still in the stands.	Who would have thought this was possible five months ago, when the team was flailing, trade talk was swirling around Washington and folks figured Martinez's job was in jeopardy?	From 19-31 during a mediocre May to the Fall Classic in an outstanding October -- and the city's first World Series appearance since 1933.	Extending their stunning turnaround, the wild-card Nationals got RBI from middle-of-the-order stars Anthony Rendon and Juan Soto in a seven-run first inning Tuesday night, and Patrick Corbin's 12-strikeout performance plus a trio of relievers helped hold on to beat the St. Louis Cardinals 7-4 in Game 4 to complete a sweep in the NLCS.	"Often, bumpy roads lead to beautiful places," said Martinez, who underwent a heart procedure in September, "and this is a beautiful place."	Right from the first inning Tuesday, most in a sellout crowd of 43,976 rose from their seats to applaud or yell or twirl their red towels, to chant "Let's go, Nats!" and "M-V-P!" and various players' names, enjoying every moment of that game-deciding outburst.	And then, a couple of hours and several innings later, as Tanner Rainey, Sean Doolittle and Daniel Hudson were protecting a shrinking lead, those same spectators stood and shouted and reveled some more.	"I just kept counting down: We're 12 outs from the World Series. We're nine outs from the World Series," shortstop Trea Turner said. "Six. Three."	Now the Nationals get plenty of time to rest and set up their so-far terrific rotation before beginning the last series of the season against the Houston Astros or New York Yankees in a week. Houston leads the best-of-seven AL Championship Series 2-1 after winning Game 3 at New York 4-1 Tuesday.	The Nationals became the fourth team to reach the World Series after being 12 games under .500.	"We think we can compete with any team, any time," NLCS MVP Howie Kendrick said. "People always get caught up in the things that are on paper, but the reality of it is you have to go out and play. Once we get out on the field, anything can happen."	The last time the World Series came to the nation's capital, more than eight decades ago, the Washington Senators lost to the New York Giants in five games. Have to go even further back, to 1924, for the city's lone baseball championship, when the Senators defeated the Giants.	The Senators eventually left, and the town didn't have a major league team at all for more than three decades until the Montreal Expos -- who were founded in 1969 and never made it to the World Series -- moved to Washington in 2005.	The Nationals had never managed to advance in the postseason since arriving, going 0-4 in the NLDS over the last seven years, including three Game 5 losses at home.	First baseman Ryan Zimmerman, the Nationals' first draft pick in Washington, was there for all of that heartache.	"Sometimes," he said, "you got to wait for good things."	This month alone, the Nationals beat the Milwaukee Brewers in the NL wild-card game after trailing 3-1 heading to the eighth, and eliminated the league-best Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 5 of the NL Division Series after trailing 3-1 heading to the eighth again.	Then came this lopsided dismissal of the NL Central champion Cardinals, who were outscored 20-6 in the series.	"Of course, we could've played better," said St. Louis first baseman Paul Goldschmidt, who was 1 for 16 with nine strikeouts in the NLCS, "but we didn't."	Corbin, a left-handed pitcher signed with $140 million of the money that became available last offseason when Bryce Harper left town to join the Philadelphia Phillies, was not quite the equal of Washington's other starters in the series.	Still, he did become the first pitcher to strike out 10 batters in the first four innings of a postseason game and earned the win after allowing four runs in five innings.	Then Martinez turned to his NL-worst bullpen, such a problem for so much of this season.	After Rainey got three outs, and Doolittle got five, Hudson came in for his fourth save in four chances this postseason. It wasn't easy, though: After replacing Doolittle with two outs in the eighth, Hudson hit his first batter and walked his second, bringing pinch-hitter Matt Carpenter to the plate as the go-ahead run with the bases loaded.	Carpenter, a career .481 batter with the bases full, grounded out to second baseman Brian Dozier, a defensive replacement who briefly lost the ball before gathering it and throwing to first to end that inning.	Hudson finished things with a perfect ninth, getting Tommy Edman on a fly ball to center field to end it, and red fireworks went off around the stadium.	Corbin got this evening started with a 1-2-3 top of the first, striking out all three Cardinals with a high, 95 mph fastball, a real contrast to the off-speed stuff Stephen Strasburg used for his own dozen Ks a night earlier.	In the bottom half, Washington put up those seven runs, all charged to rookie Dakota Hudson, who lasted all of 15 pitches -- doing to the Cardinals what they did in the previous round, when they scored 10 to open Game 5 of the NLDS against Atlanta.	All the heartache of playoffs past seemed to dissipate during an evening that only briefly was tense for the home team and its supporters: In the fifth, a juggled Cardinals lineup finally awoke, scoring three runs -- one more than the team managed to produce in Games 1/3 combined -- to get within 7-4.	With a man on second and the tying run in the on-deck circle, Corbin came through, striking out St. Louis' 3-4 hitters, Paul Goldschmidt and Marcell Ozuna, with sliders.	After becoming comeback specialists, the Nationals never trailed against the Cardinals. And dating to the final week of the regular season, Washington has won 16 of its past 18 games.	"We proved -- and this doesn't require advanced sabermetrics," Cardinals manager Mike Shildt said, "you have to get a lead to win a game."	UP NEXT	Cardinals: Their next game will come in spring training, an exhibition at home in Jupiter, Florida, on Feb. 22.	Nationals: They will play Games 1 and 2 of the World Series at the AL team's stadium, because both the Astros (107) and Yankees (103)  won more games than Washington's 93 in the regular season. Games 3, 4 and, if necessary, 5 will be at Nationals Park. Washington did not face either Houston or the Yankees in interleague play in 2019.	---	Follow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at http://twitter.com/HowardFendrich	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

NEW YORK --  They have the pitching, and they don't need the pitches. Certainly, the Houston Astros have confidence for good reason on the brink of another World Series.	"It's Justin Verlander," reliever Ryan Pressly said.	George Springer and Carlos Correa each hit three-run homers and the Astros got another wild ace off the hook to beat the disheveled New York Yankees 8-3 Thursday night and reach the cusp of a second World Series visit in three years.	The Astros lead the AL Championship Series 3-1, putting the 2017 World Series winners a step away from a showdown with the NL champion Washington Nationals.	Houston still has Verlander and Gerrit Cole queued up for this series, and the Yankees will have to beat both to survive. Verlander will start Game 5 on Friday night against James Paxton.	Springer lined an errant splitter from playoff star Masahiro Tanaka in the third inning for his homer, and Correa battered Chad Green's fastball when New York turned to its vaunted bullpen. Those All-Star sluggers have combined for just five hits in the series, but four have been homers.	Earlier in the day, Astros manager AJ Hinch ardently denied that his team has skirted rules to steal signs after an allegation by the Yankees, which was investigated and cleared by Major League Baseball. He also made it clear: If a pitcher is tipping what's coming, Houston will take advantage.	The Astros are tired of that talk detracting from their sluggers.	"I think it's disrespectful that every time we score a lot of runs, people talk about tipping," Correa said. "Nobody was tipping today and we scored, what, eight runs? We're great hitters. We've been doing it for a whole season."	New York worked starter Zack Greinke hard during a 28-pitch first inning, but just like against Cole in Game 3, the clutch hit never came. Pressly dodged a bases-loaded jam in the fifth, and many fans had left Yankee Stadium by the time it ended shortly before 12:30 a.m.	The Yankees are at risk of failing to make the World Series for an entire decade for the first time since the 1910s. They are 0 for 13 with runners in scoring position the past two games. Didn't help when they committed four errors in Game 4, most ever for the club in a home postseason game.	"We played poorly tonight, there's no other way to explain it," manager Aaron Boone said. "And we need to flush this immediately."	Tanaka allowed four runs -- three earned -- for New York, his most in eight postseason starts.	CC Sabathia pitched in relief for New York but was pulled with a left shoulder injury during the eighth inning. Planning to retire after the season, an emotional Sabathia covered his face with his glove as he left the field for likely the final time. Fans shouted his name as he walked off, and Cole and Springer were among the Houston players who stood and clapped for the 39-year-old.	"I hate to see that for him," said Hinch, who played with and against Sabathia. "I hate to see that for the sport."	Gary Sanchez ended a lengthy postseason slide with a two-run homer, but a reshuffled Yankees lineup -- still without injured Giancarlo Stanton -- again couldn't string together its damage.	During warmups, a buzzing Bronx crowd jeered Greinke with chants of "Donald! Donald!" -- his given first name -- and the veteran right-hander wobbled early. He walked three in the first inning for the first time since April 2007, including a four-pitch, bases-loaded free pass to Brett Gardner, and fell into a quick 1-0 hole.	Greinke struggled especially to locate his fastball before blowing one past Sanchez during a three-pitch K to end the inning. He sharpened up and retired nine straight before the Yankees pushed him out of the game while loading the bases in the fifth.	Pressly struck out Gleyber Torres -- on a tight check swing -- and Edwin Encarnacion to escape.	"So far this series our bullpen has been huge to complement a really good starting rotation," Hinch said.	Greinke was charged with just one run, working around four walks against the patient-but-punchless Yankees.	"Just missing by a little bit early," Greinke said.	Springer is batting .132 in these playoffs, slumping just like he did in 2017 before breaking out to win World Series MVP. This homer was his 13th in the postseason, snapping a tie with teammate Jose Altuve for the club record.	Correa made it 6-1 in the sixth. At 25 years, 25 days, he is the youngest player with 10 postseason home runs, surpassing Albert Pujols.	"I grew up a huge fan of Albert Pujols," Correa said. "I even wear No. 5 all the way growing up."	Correa ended Game 2 with a home run in the 11th inning and connected again in October after missing a lot of time this year with injuries.	Sanchez snapped a 2-for-23 skid to start this postseason with his two-run homer in the sixth.	Otherwise, the AL East champion Yankees looked like they belonged in a lesser league. Sure-handed first baseman DJ LeMahieu booted two groundballs, Torres also made two errors at second, and reliever Adam Ottavino was pulled before getting an out for the fourth time in seven appearances this postseason.	"Our guys are studs and I think they embrace the challenge," Boone said. "Obviously we've got our backs against the wall now."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: Stanton has missed the past three games after straining his right quad in Game 1. Boone said Stanton was available to pinch hit and could be New York's designated hitter Friday.	UP NEXT	Paxton said he watched tape from his Game 2 start and insists he wasn't tipping pitches. Houston grinded him out of the game after 2 1/3 innings. Verlander pitched two-run ball into the seventh, the only damage coming on Aaron Judge's two-run homer.	---	Follow Jake Seiner: https://twitter.com/Jake-Seiner	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

NEW YORK --  James Paxton was filled with nerves, and so were New York Yankees fans, worried the season was slipping away.	Tension only surged when the top of the first featured a little grounder that got away, a passed ball and a run-scoring wild pitch.	No worries.	Boom! DJ LeMahieu drove Justin Verlander's second pitch over the wall to tie the score.	Clang! Aaron Hicks hit a three-run homer off the foul pole later in the inning.	Just like that, the Bronx Bombers were back -- in the game, and in this matchup of powerhouses.	A day after a brutal loss, and with little margin for more errors, the Yankees played like a 103-win team. Paxton chilled Houston's bats and the bullpen followed with shutdown relief to beat the Astros 4-1 Friday night, cutting New York's AL Championship Series deficit to 3-2.	"I wasn't ready to go home yet," Paxton said, "so I wanted to go out and give my team everything I had and just battle away."	Now the teams rush to Texas, where the series resumes Saturday night without a day off. With pitching plans disrupted by a rainout earlier this week, both teams plan all-bullpen efforts in Game 6. But Gerrit Cole, 19-0 since May, looms as the Astros' starter on Sunday if New York manages to extend the matchup to the seven-game limit.	"We've just got to go back home and finish the job," Houston's Carlos Correa said.	Paxton, a fishing aficionado born outside Vancouver in Ladner, British Columbia, wore three-quarter-length sleeves on a night with a game-time temperature of 52 degrees. That was the coldest for a Verlander start since last year's ALCS opener at Boston, according to STATS -- he had on long sleeves and half of Houston's fielders had hoodies or balaclavas.	After lasting just 2 1/3 innings in Game 2, Paxton struck out nine in six innings, allowing four hits and four walks. Punching his pitching hand into his glove after big strikeouts, he saved his biggest emotion for his 112th and final pitch. Manager Aaron Boone had just made a trip to the mound, unsure whether he would make a change.	"He just said, `Are you ready? Do you have anything more left in the tank?" Paxton said.	"And I said, `Yeah, let's go. I want this."	Robinson Chirinos hit a first-pitch fastball that Brett Gardner caught in front of the left-field scoreboard with a runner on.	"When it first left the bat: `Oh, no!" Boone remembered thinking to himself.	After Tommy Kahnle allowed George Springer's one-out single in seventh and walked Jose Altuve, Zack Britton retired Michael Brantley and Alex Bregman. Britton struck out two in a perfect eighth, and Aroldis Chapman finished with a 1-2-3 ninth for the save.	Paxton outpitched Verlander, an eight-time All-Star and former AL MVP and Cy Young Award winner, on a night when each team had five hits.	Verlander opened with a JV first inning -- not Justin vintage, but junior varsity. He allowed a pair of first-inning homers for the first time in 28 postseason starts and gave up four runs in an inning for the first time since Houston acquired him from Detroit in August 2017.	"Fastball command wasn't very good, and the slider was just hanging," Verlander said.	Verlander retired 10 in a row after Hicks' homer and wound up allowing five hits in seven innings with nine strikeouts and no walks.	"We took advantage of his missed locations when he was a little vulnerable," LeMahieu said. "And that's the difference in the game."	A night after the Yankees made four errors in one of their messier games this season during an 8-3 loss, Paxton fell behind after 14 pitches. Springer reached on an infield hit, took second on Gary Sanchez's passed ball, advanced on a groundout and scored when Paxton bounced a breaking ball off Sanchez's glove for a wild pitch.	"A lot of nerves," Paxton said. "I was just overthrowing a little bit early."	New York came out swinging against Verlander, who had been 4-0 with a 2.38 ERA against the Yankees in seven postseason starts.	LeMahieu fouled off a pitch, then drove a fastball 355 feet to right-center for New York's first postseason leadoff homer since Derek Jeter in the 2009 ALCS against the Angels.	"Woke up the building," Astros manager AJ Hinch said.	Aaron Judge singled and Gleyber Torres doubled. Verlander struck out Giancarlo Stanton, who went 0 for 3 with two strikeouts after missing three games with a strained right quadriceps.	Hicks was sidelined for more than two months by a right elbow injury that made him wonder whether he would need Tommy John surgery, then made a surprise return for the ALCS and re-entered the starting lineup for Game 3.	He fell behind 0-2, took three straight balls and sent a chest-high slider down the right field line. He dropped his bat, turned and watched the ball, took a half-dozen slow steps toward first and started jogging after it clanked off the pole for his first home run since July 24.	"It curved a lot more than I thought it would," Hicks said.	New York had never hit a pair of first-inning homers in 404 previous postseason games. Verlander could only crouch on the infield grass as Hicks circled the bases.	Hicks ended a stretch of 15 straight hitless at-bats for the Yankees with runners in scoring position. New York has relied on the long ball, scoring 12 of its 17 runs against the Astros on seven homers.	"We just always fight back," Judge said. "That's what we talked about in our meeting today. Let's go back to being ourselves."	FIRSTS	This was the 1,609th postseason game in major league history, and the first in which both teams scored in the first inning and neither scored the rest of the game.	SABATHIA	CC Sabathia dislocated his left shoulder while pitching in Game 4 and was replaced on the Yankees active roster by RHP Ben Heller. That ended the 19-season career of the 39-year-old left-hander, who is retiring. He was given a big ovation when shown on the video board in the sixth and waved to fans from the dugout.	UP NEXT	Neither team announced a Game 6 starter. Rookie RHP Jose Urquidy is Houston's most likely option, and New York could go with RHP Chad Green as an opener or start LHP J.A. Happ. New York would start RHP Luis Severino in a Game 7.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

HOUSTON --  Jose Altuve, the 5-foot-6 driving force of Houston, delivered a swing that will play in Astros' highlights forever.	Altuve homered off Aroldis Chapman with two outs in the ninth inning and Houston outlasted the New York Yankees 6-4 Saturday night to advance to the World Series for the second time in three years.	"That's one of the best moments of postseason history," Houston general manager Jeff Luhnow said.	In a bullpen Game 6 with a back-and-forth finish, DJ LeMahieu hit a tying, two-run shot off Astros closer Roberto Osuna in the top of the ninth. Altuve answered with a two-run drive to left-center, setting off a wild celebration at Minute Maid Park and earning himself AL Championship Series MVP.	"Beautiful game," Altuve said.	Astros ace Gerrit Cole was waiting to pitch a potential Game 7 on Sunday. Instead, the postseason star -- undefeated since May 22 -- can be lined up for Game 1 at home against the NL champion Washington Nationals on Tuesday night.	Yuli Gurriel hit a three-run homer in the first inning, and flashy outfield defense helped Houston's relievers defeat the Yankees and their vaunted bullpen.	It almost fell apart in the ninth. Gio Urshela singled off Osuna leading off for his third hit of the game, and LeMahieu put a ball into the first row of seats in right field -- inches over the glove of leaping George Springer -- to tie it at 4.	Altuve, a sparkplug touted as Houston's heart and soul, didn't let this one get away.	"I get asked to describe Jose Altuve all the time," manager AJ Hinch said. "I think MVP is what he is."	The teams combined to use 14 pitchers in a drawn-out game that lasted 4 hours, 9 minutes.	Houston's Will Harris, who got four outs over the sixth and seventh innings and has yet to allow a run this postseason, was glad Houston's bullpen got to show its stuff.	"We have a lot of guys with a lot of pride that are really good at their jobs," he said. "And I was excited for the opportunity for us to prove that today."	The defense helped. Right fielder Josh Reddick dived for Brett Gardner's liner for the second out of the sixth. An inning later, left fielder Michael Brantley laid out for Aaron Hicks' shallow floater and doubled off Aaron Judge at first.	Gurriel, a holdover from Houston's 2017 championship team, was 1 for 20 to start the ALCS before his drive in the first inning. He jumped all over a high-and-tight fastball from opener Chad Green, and his shot into the Crawford Boxes was his first connection this postseason.	It's the third time Houston has eliminated New York in the past five postseasons. The Astros won the 2015 wild-card game in the Bronx and beat the Yankees in seven games in the 2017 ALCS before winning their first title.	"I feel like we are on equal footing with them," Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. "Unfortunately, sports can be a little bit cruel for the team that goes home."	Washington is seeking its first championship in the 51-season history of the Montreal Expos/Nationals franchise. The original Washington Senators won their only championship for the nation's capital in 1924 and last reached the World Series in 1933 before becoming the Minnesota Twins for the 1961 season.	Gary Sanchez had an RBI single in the second and Urshela homered in the fourth for the Yankees.	Alex Bregman gave the Astros an insurance run with an RBI on a forceout in the sixth inning.	Brantley's double play elicited one of the loudest ovations of the night -- before Altuve's blast -- from the sellout crowd of 43,357 which included Hall of Famers Nolan Ryan and Craig Biggio and Rockets stars James Harden and Russell Westbrook, who watched from the front row in personalized orange Astros jerseys.	New York was 1 for 6 with runners in scoring position and 3 for 24 over the final five games of the series. The franchise lost its fourth straight ALCS after falling in 2010, 2012 and 2017. The Yankees will go without a World Series appearance in a calendar decade for the first time since the 1910s.	"The work never ends," Boone said. "And we'll continue to try and I guess close that gap."	Altuve doubled off Green with one out in the first inning and Bregman drew a walk with two outs. After a short visit to the mound, Gurriel knocked the next pitch into the seats in left field for a 3-0 lead. The runs were Houston's first with two outs in the series.	Houston had been 4 for 40 with runners in scoring position before that big swing.	Brad Peacock, who threw eight pitches in a scoreless eighth inning Friday night, became the fourth pitcher ever to finish a postseason game and then start the next day, and the first since 1924.	He needed seven pitches to retire the side in the first before running into trouble with two outs in the second. Josh James ended the inning by striking out Gardner.	Ryan Pressly had another gutsy escape, too. He hurt his right knee again fielding a bases-loaded grounder by Didi Gregorius but limped over to tag him for the final out of the third. Pressly, who grimaced as he went toward the dugout after one pitch, had arthroscopic surgery on the same knee on Aug. 22 and returned Sept. 20. Pressly also got two strikeouts with the bases loaded in Game 4.	He said that some scar tissue broke off on the play but that he'll be ready to go this week.	"It's the World Series," Hinch said. "It will be all hands on deck."	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

HOUSTON --  Juan Soto and the Washington Nationals quickly derailed the Cole Express.	A 20-year-old prodigy with a passion for the big moment, Soto homered onto the train tracks high above the left field wall and hit a two-run double as the Nationals tagged Gerrit Cole and the Houston Astros 5-4 Tuesday night in the World Series opener.	"After the first at-bat, I just said, `It's another baseball game," Soto said. "In the first at-bat, I'm not going to lie, I was a little bit shaking in my legs."	Not even a history-making home run by postseason star George Springer -- and another shot that nearly tied it in the eighth inning -- could deter Washington.	Ryan Zimmerman, still full of sock at 35, also homered to back a resourceful Max Scherzer and boost the wild-card Nationals in their first World Series appearance -- tres bien for a franchise that began as the Montreal Expos in 1969.	"They waited a long time," Nationals manager Dave Martinez said.	Otherworldly almost all season, Cole looked downright ordinary. Trea Turner singled on the second pitch of the game and the Nationals were off and running, ending Cole's 19-game winning streak that stretched back 25 starts to May.	"I didn't have my A-game tonight," Cole said.	Not what Cole or anyone else at Minute Maid Park expected, especially after he led the majors in strikeouts, topped the AL in ERA and finished second in the big leagues in wins to teammate Justin Verlander.	Cole had breezed through the AL playoffs, too.	Yet it was a further testament to an eternal truth about baseball: It doesn't matter what you do the whole season if you don't get it done in October.	"I think he's been so good for so long that there builds this thought of invincibility and that it's impossible to beat him," Astros manager AJ Hinch said. "So when it happens it is a surprise to all of us because we've watched for months this guy completely dominate the opposition."	Soto finished with three hits and a stolen base. Three days shy of his 21st birthday, the wunderkind left fielder also snared Michael Brantley's late try for a tying hit.	Relentless at the plate, he's already become one of those rare players -- like Springer -- who seems to turn pressure into production.	How's he do it? Better launch angle? Improved swing path?	Uh, not really.	"Sometimes I just put gum in my mouth," Soto said. "But most of the time, just take a deep breath and focus. It's just the pitcher and me."	"Everybody around, I forget about everybody around. It's just you and me," he said, adding, "try to enjoy it."	The MVP when Houston won its first crown in 2017, Springer set a record by connecting in his fifth straight Series game to make it 5-3 in the seventh. But reliever Daniel Hudson threw a fastball past rookie Yordan Alvarez with the bases loaded to end the inning.	In the eighth, Springer put a charge into a drive to deep right-center, and it appeared as though he might've hit a tying, two-run homer. Springer took a couple of hops out of the batter's box to watch, and had to settle for an RBI double when the ball glanced off the glove of a leaping Adam Eaton at the fence.	Heavily favored at the start, the 107-win Astros will try to get even Wednesday night when Verlander faces Stephen Strasburg in another matchup of aces.	Scherzer slipped in and out of trouble for five innings. But every time the stadium got rollicking, he found a way to get out of jams. There's a reason ol' Max has won three Cy Young Awards.	"We got old and young guys," Scherzer said.	Projected Game 4 starter Patrick Corbin threw a scoreless sixth for the Nationals. Springer connected off Tanner Rainey for his 14th career postseason home run before Hudson fanned Alvarez on three pitches.	Hudson retired Jose Altuve, and Sean Doolittle got Brantley on a lineout to strand Springer at second in the eighth. Doolittle then closed for a save to give the Nationals their seventh straight victory and 17th in 19 games dating to their September playoff run.	Leading the way was Soto, whose eighth-inning hit in the wild-card win over Milwaukee sent the Nationals on their path.	"He's got kind of the `it' factor," Hinch said. "He's got the twitch. He's got fast hands. He's got no fear."	Soto looked overmatched when he fanned on Cole's 99 mph heater in the first inning. Turned out Soto was just getting warmed up.	He justified his place in the 4-spot, launching a leadoff drive in the fourth to make it 2-all. He became the fourth-youngest player to homer in the Series, behind Andruw Jones, Miguel Cabrera and Mickey Mantle.	The ball was later retrieved from the train tracks and donated by Soto for a long ride to the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.	Washington took the lead in the fifth. Eaton hit a tiebreaking single and Soto doubled with two outs for a 5-2 advantage.	After the game, Soto agreed to donate his home run ball to the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.	Zimmerman hit the first World Series homer in Nationals history, connecting in the second. He was the first player drafted by the team for the 2005 season.	"It's been a long ride," Zimmerman said.	Cole left after the seventh, getting a pat from Hinch in the dugout. Watching from the front row behind the plate was someone who also knows a lot about pitching -- Astros executive, Texas great and Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan, the Ryan Express himself.	Yuli Gurriel put Houston ahead with a two-run double in the first.	UP NEXT	Nationals: Strasburg was 3-0 with a 1.64 ERA in the NL playoffs. He went 18-6 and set a career high for wins during the regular season.	Astros: Verlander is 0-4 with a 5.67 ERA in five World Series starts. He got this far with Detroit in 2006 and 2012 and the Astros in 2017.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

Simone Biles does a backflip you have to see to believe before throwing the first pitch before Game 2 of the World Series. (0:22)	HOUSTON --  Stephen Strasburg's time had come.	Famously held out of the postseason seven years ago, Strasburg delivered on the biggest stage of all Wednesday night.	The right-hander outpitched fellow ace Justin Verlander, overcoming a shaky start to help the Washington Nationals beat the Houston Astros 12-3 for a commanding 2-0 lead in the World Series.	Strasburg went six innings to earn the win -- and a group hug in the dugout when he was done on the mound.	"They keep squeezing me a little harder every time," he said. "That's OK."	Kurt Suzuki hit a tiebreaking homer in what became a messy six-run seventh, and the Nationals headed back home needing two wins in three potential games in Washington to claim their first championship.	Adam Eaton paraded around the bases pointing to the Houston crowd after a late home run as the Nationals won their eighth in a row. They've won 18 of 20 overall dating back to the regular season, with the last two over AL Cy Young Award favorites Gerrit Cole and Verlander.	Game 3 is Friday night when Anibal Sanchez opposes Houston's Zack Greinke in the first World Series game in the nation's capital since 1933.	"Probably going to be a little frigid, might be a little cold, so bring your jackets and your beanies," said slugger Anthony Rendon, who hit a two-run double in the first inning.	The 31-year-old Strasburg had waited years for this chance. Back in 2012, he was about two years removed from Tommy John surgery when Nationals brass decided protecting his elbow was more important than pitching him in the playoffs, so he was shut down late in a season full of promise.	Making his Series debut, Strasburg allowed a two-run homer to Alex Bregman in the first before throwing five shutout innings to improve to 4-0 this postseason. He allowed seven hits and struck out seven.	Nationals manager Dave Martinez was asked what's made Strasburg so good this October.	"One, he has the confidence to do it and two, he's become a premier pitcher, a big-game pitcher," Martinez said. "He doesn't get rattled."	Verlander, so good in the regular season, fell to 0-5 in six World Series starts. He gave up seven hits and four runs, and was lifted after walking a batter following Suzuki's home run.	Verlander led the majors with 21 wins this season and struck out a career-high 300 to reach 3,000 in his career. He has a World Series ring, MVP and Cy Young Award trophies, and three no-hitters to his name.	He fanned six to become the career leader in postseason strikeouts with 202 -- another impressive statistic on a stellar resume that's still missing that elusive World Series win.	"Obviously it's magnified in the World Series when you're not clicking on all cylinders," Verlander said.	Their wins against Houston's best pitchers turned the underdog Nationals into heavy favorites to take the title.	Only three of the previous 25 teams to lose the first two games at home under the 2-3-2 format have come back to win the Series. No one has done it since the 1996 New York Yankees.	"I wish I was a betting man, but I'm not," Martinez said. "I don't really believe in that stuff. ... We're here because the boys never gave up."	Long after most players had left the field and only a handful of Nationals were left, a small but boisterous crowd of Washington fans assembled behind their dugout. The red-clad group cheered and waved their hands as players ascended the dugout stairs, finishing up an out-of-town party they hope to continue at home on Friday.	But the Astros insist the tough start hasn't dampened their confidence.	"We have a really good team," manager AJ Hinch said. "Clearly, the Nats have outplayed us -- bottom line. They came into our building and played two really good games. We're going to have to try to sleep off the latter third of this game."	Added shortstop Carlos Correa on digging out of the early hole: "If there is a team out there that can do it, it's us."	Things went wrong immediately for Verlander when he walked leadoff man Trea Turner on four pitches. Eaton, who homered in the eighth, singled before Rendon, the Houston native who said he'd certainly have 100 friends and family members at Minute Maid Park for each game, knocked a ball off the wall in left field to put the Nationals up 2-0.	"This is my city. I love Houston," Rendon said. "We were going to try to just steal one game and we just happened to steal two, and we've got to take care of business at home."	Verlander got his 200th postseason strikeout when he fanned Victor Robles in the second. The eight-time All-Star passed John Smoltz, who had 199 and was in the TV booth for Fox to see his record fall.	Verlander and Strasburg both settled in after early wobbles, until Houston fell apart in the seventh.	Suzuki sent Verlander's 100th pitch sailing above the seats in left field to start the inning. Ryan Pressly, who left Game 6 of the ALCS with a knee injury, took over and didn't look right from the start.	He walked Turner before Hinch called for his first intentional walk of the season when he gave Juan Soto a free pass to load the bases with two outs. Howie Kendrick, Asdrubal Cabrera and Ryan Zimmerman followed with successive singles to bust it open, putting the Nationals up 8-2. As those hits were piling up and run after run crossed the plate, many in the stunned sellout crowd of 43,357 began streaming for the exits.	Hinch was asked what happened in the seventh.	"Where would you like me to start?" he said.	Michael A. Taylor padded the lead further with a solo homer off Chris Devenski in the ninth.	The only time Strasburg was under any real duress after the first inning came when Yuli Gurriel doubled with one out in the sixth before the Nationals intentionally walked Yordan Alvarez. The slumping Correa hit a weak fly ball before rookie pinch-hitter Kyle Tucker struck out, allowing Strasburg to wriggle out of the jam and end his solid night.	UP NEXT	Sanchez has made two sharp starts this postseason and took a no-hitter into the eighth inning in Game 1 of the NLCS against St. Louis.	Greinke, acquired from Arizona at the July 31 trade deadline, is 0-2 with a 6.43 ERA in three October outings.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

WASHINGTON --  From the moment George Springer jumped on the game's third pitch for a single, then quickly swiped a base, to the way he and his teammates sprinted off the field after the final out a little past midnight Saturday, the Houston Astros were suddenly aggressive and energetic.	And suddenly right back in the thick of this World Series.	Yes, the Fall Classic finally showed up back in Washington, 86 years later -- and, sparked by Springer and Jose Altuve, the Astros finally showed up in the Fall Classic.	Springer had two of Houston's four steals, Altuve doubled twice before scoring each time, Zack Greinke repeatedly worked out of trouble, and the Astros made sure they wouldn't go quietly despite looking listless twice at home, beating the Nationals 4-1 on Friday night to cut their Series deficit to 2-1.	"We're pretty good, too," Astros manager AJ Hinch said. "It kind of re-establishes us."	Houston can even things up in Game 4 on Saturday night at Nationals Park. Washington will start $140 million lefty Patrick Corbin, while Hinch said he'll go with rookie Jose Urquidy.	"We didn't panic," Altuve said.	Washington's eight-game winning streak, tied for the longest in a single postseason, ended with a sloppy performance in the first Series game hosted by the nation's capital since the Senators lost to the New York Giants in 1933.	A sellout crowd of 43,867, dressed mostly in red for the occasion, soaked it all in, standing in unison at key moments, booing ball-strike calls that hurt their team, chanting "Let's go, Nats!" often and even getting to do their "Baby Shark" sing-and-clap-along when that children's tune blared as a walk-up song in the sixth.	"It was electric," Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. "The boys in the dugout, they were fired up."	But the wild-card Nationals were unable to move one win from a championship, undone by an inability to come through in the clutch: Birthday boy Juan Soto, MVP candidate Anthony Rendon and Co. were 0 for 10 with runners in scoring position, leaving 12 runners on base.	"Tonight we were a little bit aggressive outside the strike zone," Martinez said. "We took balls I thought we should hit, uncharacteristic of what we've been doing."	How big was this win for Houston?	No team ever has come back after dropping the first three games of a World Series.	"Not the script you'd want to write to start out a World Series," said reliever Will Harris, who retired all five batters he faced Friday. "We believe in each other in there. We know we have obviously a very talented, capable team."	That's why several Astros players gathered for a private meeting following their 12-3 loss Wednesday.	"Some guys said some things that a lot of us maybe were thinking in our head, but it's sometimes nice to hear them out loud," Harris said. "And the biggest thing was we didn't want anybody feeling sorry for themselves coming here, because that's not going to accomplish anything."	After playing what might have been their worst baseball of 2019, the Astros played like the club that led the majors with 107 regular-season wins.	And, not surprisingly, Altuve was in the middle of a lot of it. He doubled in the third and fifth, coming home on singles by Michael Brantley.	"Jose's the heart and soul of what we do," Hinch said. "It was his turn to be a catalyst."	Greinke, the 2009 AL Cy Young Award winner, allowed seven hits and three walks in 4 2/3 innings, but managed to yield just one run. He was followed by five relievers who combined to give up two hits and zero runs the rest of the way.	Josh James earned the win, striking out Ryan Zimmerman with two aboard to end the fifth.	"Huge," Hinch said.	Roberto Osuna heard boos when he entered in the ninth, then got three outs for a save.	Josh Reddick delivered an RBI single in the second, Robinson Chirinos homered off the foul-pole screen in the sixth and Houston scored four runs in 5 1/3 innings off Anibal Sanchez. The 35-year-old righty had taken a no-hitter into the eighth inning of his previous start; Springer got to him right away.	Sanchez went sprawling off the mound to try to make a play, but couldn't. All part of a rough night in which he got so upset by a couple of ball calls that he asked plate umpire Gary Cederstrom, "Where was that one?"	Sanchez also barely avoided taking a ball to the face, getting his glove in the way just in time. Another Houston hit came when Springer sent a comebacker off reliever Joe Ross' foot.	In sum: After the Nationals could do no wrong for so long, things went awry.	They made two errors and at least three other misplays on what were ruled hits. Washington catcher Kurt Suzuki left in the sixth with a right hip flexor problem. Soto, serenaded by fans in left field to celebrate his 21st birthday, was charged with an error for a wild throw home, let another ball trickle past his glove and went 0 for 4 with three strikeouts at the plate.	He went down looking to end the game.	"Nobody," Washington outfielder Adam Eaton said, "thought this was going to be easy."	UP NEXT	Astros: Urquidy found out after Game 3 that he will start Saturday; he only threw 41 innings during the regular season. Hinch is prepared to rely heavily on his relievers, saying: "Every World Series game is a bullpen game, mostly, at some point."	Nationals: Corbin will be making his seventh appearance of this postseason, a third start to go along with four outings out of the bullpen. He is 1-2 with a 6.91 ERA, including one scoreless inning in relief during Game 1 of the World Series.	---	Follow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at http://twitter.com/HowardFendrich	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

WASHINGTON --  Not bad for a TBA.	Unheralded rookie Jose Urquidy outpitched all those big-name aces who preceded him, quieting Washington's bats and the Nationals Park crowd, too.	Alex Bregman busted out of his slump with a go-ahead single in the first inning and a grand slam in the seventh, and the resurgent Houston Astros routed the Nationals 8-1 Saturday night to pull even at two games apiece in an unpredictable World Series that's been one big road show.	Urquidy had never pitched above Class A before this year. This stage seemed surreal.	"A couple of moments," he said, "I was thinking about, oh my God, I'm in a World Series pitching."	Game 1 winner Max Scherzer takes the mound Sunday night hoping to get Washington a home Series victory for the first time since the Senators won at Griffith Stadium in 1933. In a rematch of the opener, Gerrit Cole goes for Houston after losing for the first time since May.	Visiting teams have won the first four games for the first time since 1996, when the Yankees broke the pattern in Game 6 against Atlanta to take the title.	Game 6 will be Tuesday night in Houston, when the Astros lose their road-field advantage.	"This is what it's all about," Bregman said. "This is a beautiful thing. It's two teams battling it out. They've got great pitching, great offenses. It's been fun so far, and just want to keep it rolling."	Yuli Gurriel also drove in a run in the first as Houston strung together four singles in a seven-pitch span for a 2-0 lead against Patrick Corbin. Robinson Chirinos homered for the second straight day, a two-run drive that boosted the lead to 4-0 in the fourth.	Fans started leaving in the seventh, when the Astros sent 10 batters to the plate and battered the bullpen. Bregman, who began the night in a 1-for-13 Series slide, had the big blow, driving a low, inside fastball from Fernando Rodney into the left field stands of the ballpark where he was the All-Star Game MVP in 2018.	Bregman held his bat high as he slowly walked out of the batter's box, then took 28 seconds to savor circling the bases.	Orange-clad Houston fans in the right field upper deck chanted "Let's go Astros!" as Nationals fans were silenced. Wild-card Washington lost consecutive games for the first time since Sept. 13-14 against Atlanta.	"I think tonight was really the first time we really did what the Houston Astros offense can do," outfielder Josh Reddick said.	Starting pitchers were the talk of the Series coming in, with Washington's Stephen Strasburg, Scherzer and Corbin combining for 12 All-Star picks and three Cy Young Awards. The baseball cards of Houston's Cole, Justin Verlander and Zack Greinke sparkle with 17 All-Star selections, two Cy Youngs and one MVP.	But there were just five 1-2-3 innings by starters in the first three games, and the most consecutive outs were turned in by Nationals veteran Anibal Sanchez, who retired seven straight in Game 3.	Urquidy, who rebounded from Tommy John surgery in 2016, exceeded them all.	"Maybe he doesn't have the Max Scherzer, Gerrit Cole name, but he's got good stuff," Washington leadoff man Trea Turner said.	Urquidy wasn't even announced as Houston's starter until after Game 3, with manager AJ Hinch hoping to piece together innings any way he could.	The 24-year-old right-hander began the season at Double-A Corpus Christi, then was bumped up to Triple-A Round Rock in mid-May and made his major league debut in July. It wasn't all success: Urquidy was pounded for 11 runs and 14 hits at El Paso on Aug. 7.	"I think I was a little crazy, a little ruined from the heat," he said.	He faced the Nationals in just his 12th big league appearance, joining Fernando Valenzuela (1981) and Jaime Garcia (2011) as the only Mexican starting pitchers in Series history -- and Valenzuela as the only ones to win. Urquidy's mother, Alma, was on hand.	"My mom is someone that I talk to a lot and obviously she helped me out this morning," Urquidy said. "We had coffee, just gave me some words of encouragement."	Urquidy allowed two hits in five scoreless innings, striking out four and walking none.	"From the very beginning I thought he was calm, I thought he was in control of his stuff," Hinch said. "His fastball had a little extra life to it. It's had good life this postseason. And then he just came up with big pitch after big pitch."	Mixing four-seam fastballs in the mid-90 mph range with two-seamers, sliders, curves and changeups, Urquidy set down the Nationals in order in the second, fourth and fifth, retiring his final nine batters. He threw 30 of his first 38 pitches for strikes, 45 of 67 overall.	"He flipped his percentages," Washington's Adam Eaton said. "He threw me three sliders my first at-bat -- and he throws it like 10% of the time. So I was just like, going back, scratching my noggin."	Josh James, Will Harris, Hector Rondon, Brad Peacock and Chris Devenski combined for two-hit relief to close it out for Houston.	Washington's best chance to get back into the game came in the sixth, when Harris relieved with two on and one out and Houston ahead 4-0. Anthony Rendon singled off the pitcher's leg, loading the bases, and Juan Soto drove in a run with a groundout. Harris then struck out Howie Kendrick.	After going 7 for 21 with runners in scoring position during the first two games, the Nationals are 1 for 19 in the last two.	Houston flipped for the positive, going 9 for 23 with RISP after starting 3 for 17 in the two losses. The Astros burst ahead with timely hitting for the second straight night, getting consecutive one-out singles by Jose Altuve, Michael Brantley, Bregman and Gurriel.	Brantley had three hits, raising his Series average to .471 (8 for 17). Bregman also finished with three hits.	Chirinos, who homered off the screen on the left field foul pole to drive in Houston's final run in Game 3, sent a flat changeup from Corbin deep into the left field seats, then slapped his chest and grinned as he skipped across home plate. The catcher doubled in the ninth and is 4 for 11 against the Nationals.	Signed to a $140 million, six-year contract as a free agent last offseason, Corbin dropped to 1/3 in three postseason starts and four relief appearances. He actually lowered his ERA to 6.64.	After the Scherzer-Cole rematch, Houston's Justin Verlander and Stephen Strasburg are set to start Game 6.	Washington manager Dave Martinez was looking ahead.	"We've got two of our big horses going in the next two games," he said. "I just told the boys: `Hey, we're in the World Series. We're going to play Game 5, tied 2-2. Who would have thought that in the beginning?"	TRAINER'S ROOM	Washington catcher Kurt Suzuki sat out, a day after straining his right hip flexor, and backup Yan Gomes went 1 for 4 with a strikeout. Martinez hoped Suzuki would be available Sunday.

WASHINGTON --  Gerrit Cole and the Houston Astros went to Washington, hoping to snap out of their funk and bring the World Series back to Minute Maid Park.	Not only are they heading home with more games to play, now they're just one win from another crown.	Handed the ball for what was supposed to be a high-stakes showdown against Max Scherzer, Cole gave Houston a firm grip on the Series by beating the Nationals 7-1 Sunday night for a 3-2 lead.	Cole looked exactly like the stud who dominated baseball most of this season, bouncing back from a Game 1 clunker to pitch the Astros to their third straight win.	What a turnaround for his teammates, too -- outscored 17-7 overall at home, Houston hammered the Nationals 19-3 in a Washington wipeout.	"We look like ourselves now," Astros manager AJ Hinch said.	Something was definitely missing for the Nationals. Namely, Scherzer.	The three-time Cy Young Award winner beat Cole in the opener, and was the Nats' best hope to slow Houston. But then Scherzer was scratched only 3 1/2 hours before game time because of an irritated nerve near his neck, an injury that could finish him for the Series.	Slumping rookie Yordan Alvarez and Carlos Correa each hit an early two-run homer off emergency starter Joe Ross. George Springer added another postseason drive for the Astros, who led the majors with a franchise-best 107 wins during the regular season.	"We actually hit some balls hard. We really did," Washington manager Dave Martinez said. "We just can't get nothing going these last three days."	With the road team winning every time so far, Houston heads home with two chances to claim its second title in three years. Justin Verlander gets the first try when he starts against Stephen Strasburg in Game 6 on Tuesday night.	"High level of confidence," Cole said.	Cole threw three-hit ball for seven innings, nicked only by Juan Soto's home run in the seventh, and struck out nine -- eight on breaking balls.	Cole's mix of 99 mph heat and sharp secondary pitches induced a bevy of bad swings from the wild-card Nats as he improved to 4-1 with a 1.72 ERA this postseason. It might've been his final start for Houston -- he's eligible for free agency and figures to command a steep price.	Standing tall on the mound, Cole was unflappable in the face of 43,910 fans who went from fired up to furious to flat-out frustrated.	"He knew what this game meant to this Series," Hinch said. "So, nobody better to have on the mound."	The crowd gave Ross a huge ovation when he walked onto the field for warmups, sympathetic to his situation -- he had pitched a total of two innings in almost a month.	But when President Donald Trump was shown on the videoboard for about 10 seconds before the fourth inning, watching from a lower-level suite, the fans let loose with loud boos and broke into a brief but very audible chant of "Lock him up!"	The fans weren't finished, either.	Cole ended his outing by getting Victor Robles on a called third strike, a pitch the TV zone showed to be off the plate. Robles chucked his bat, helmet and gloves, and the crowd soon began a derisive chant at umpire Lance Barksdale.	"I know there were some choice words but that's just in the heat of the moment," Martinez said.	Cole acknowledged he finished his outing "with a break."	"It's tough. I think ultimately some of those pitches were off the plate," he said.	Most fans, meanwhile, stayed to the very end.	"They came to support us and really gave us everything they had all the way to the end, all 27 innings. Hats off to them. We apologize that we didn't give them more to celebrate," outfielder Adam Eaton said. "It wasn't that we didn't try."	Cole led the majors in strikeouts this year, was second to Verlander in wins and topped the AL in ERA. He took a 19-game winning streak into the opener but hardly looked like an October star, giving up five runs over seven uneven innings.	In his second shot at the Nationals, he aced the test. Cole escaped a first-and-third, no-out jam in the second, then breezed into the seventh.	With two outs and a full count on Ryan Zimmerman, Cole suddenly stepped off the mound -- video that quickly made the rounds showed two women right behind the backstop lifting their tops to flash Cole. It wasn't clear whether he saw them, and he walked Zimmerman before getting Robles.	Alvarez, normally Houston's designated hitter, justified his spot in left field in a hurry. He launched a drive to left-center in the second and went 3 for 3.	Alvarez hit 27 home runs in 87 games this season, but hadn't connected in 71 at-bats since Sept. 21.	"Obviously we did the job here, which was to win three games. And very happy to go back to Houston and to do my job to hit as a DH," he said through a translator.	Correa made it 4-0 with his homer in the fourth and Yuli Gurriel added a two-out RBI single in the eighth.	Springer's 15th career postseason home run -- seven in the World Series for the 2017 Series MVP -- finished off the rout.	UP NEXT	Nationals: Strasburg is 4-0 with a 1.93 ERA this postseason. He won the wild-card game in relief, then won starts against the Dodgers, Cardinals and Astros. He outpitched Verlander in Game 2, giving up two runs in six innings. Strasburg led the NL with 18 victories this season.	Astros: Verlander is the only pitcher to start out 0-5 in the World Series after losing Game 2. He's made six starts overall in the Fall Classic with a 5.73 ERA. Verlander went 21-6 this year and led the majors in wins, but is 1/3 with a 4.15 ERA in five postseason starts.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

HOUSTON --  It's been an unconventional road to Game 7 of the World Series for Stephen Strasburg and the Washington Nationals.	Seizing the October spotlight he missed out on as a youngster, Strasburg pitched another postseason gem into the ninth inning Tuesday night as the Nationals beat the Houston Astros 7-2 to tie this Fall Classic at 3-3.	Juan Soto ran all the way to first base with his bat following a go-ahead homer, the same way Houston slugger Alex Bregman did earlier.	Yep, these wild-card Nationals have matched the heavily favored Astros swing for swing, hit for hit -- even home run celebration for home run celebration.	Now, it's onto a winner-take-all Game 7 on Wednesday night to decide the only Series in which the visiting team won the first six.	"It's weird, really. You can't explain it," Washington manager Dave Martinez said.	Adam Eaton and Soto hit solo homers off Justin Verlander in the fifth to help the Nationals overcome a 2-1 deficit. Anthony Rendon also went deep and drove in five runs.	"Maybe they enjoy our park and maybe we enjoy their park," said Rendon, who attended high school 4 1/2 miles from Minute Maid Park. "We're not going to ask questions."	Max Scherzer, revitalized by an injection of painkiller, is primed to return from an irritated nerve in his neck to start Game 7 for Washington in a Series that's been all road, sweet, road.	Scratched from his scheduled Game 5 start only hours before the first pitch, Scherzer was warming up in the seventh inning Tuesday before Rendon's homer, then sat down as Martinez became the first manager tossed from a Series game since Atlanta's Bobby Cox in 1996.	"The cortisone shot worked. That relieved the pressure on the nerve, and then keep applying heat," Scherzer said. "Our chiropractor, he does amazing work. He was able to go in there and make adjustments. We did two treatments of it and really freed up the neck."	Zack Greinke will start for the Astros, who led the majors with 107 wins and are seeking their second title in three seasons.	"I wish it was in a National League park," Greinke joked, cracking a smile about his affinity for hitting.	Fired up after a disputed call at first base went against them in the seventh, the Nationals padded their lead moments later when Rendon hit a two-run homer off Will Harris. Martinez, still enraged at umpires, was ejected during the seventh-inning stretch, screaming as a pair of his coaches held him back while the crowd sang along to "Deep in the Heart of Texas."	Rendon added a two-run double off Chris Devenski in the ninth to just about seal it after Strasburg gutted through without his best fastball to throw five-hit ball for 8 1/3 innings. Washington pitching coach Paul Menhart told Strasburg after the first that he was tipping pitches. Strasburg allowed only three more hits.	"Started shaking my glove, so they didn't know what I was throwing," Strasburg said. "It's something that has burned me in the past, and it burned me there in the first."	Now the Nationals will attempt their ultimate comeback in a year when they were written off time after time, hoping for the first title in the 51-season history of a franchise that started as the Montreal Expos and the first for Washington since the Senators in 1924.	Visiting teams have won three straight Game 7s in the Series since the Cardinals defeated Texas at home in 2011.	"I don't think there's a person in the building that would have assumed that all road teams were going to win," Houston manager AJ Hinch said. "We've just got to make sure that last one is not the same."	Washington rebounded from a 19-31 start -- the Nats were given just a 1.6% chance to win the Series on May 23 -- to finish 93-69. They rallied from a 3-1 eighth-inning deficit against Milwaukee in the NL wild-card game, a two-games-to-one deficit vs. the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Division Series and a 2-1, fifth-inning deficit in Game 6 vs. the Astros.	Outscored 19-3 at Nationals Park while going 1 for 21 with runners in scoring position, the Nationals got the strong outing they needed from Strasburg, who allowed his only runs in the first inning, struck out seven and walked two while throwing 104 pitches.	"It was a mental grind out there, especially after the first," Strasburg said. "Just got to keep fighting."	Strasburg was memorably shut down by the Nationals in September 2012 to protect his arm in his first full season following Tommy John surgery, and Washington was beaten by St. Louis in the Division Series.	He improved to 5-0 with a 1.98 ERA in six postseason outings this October -- five starts and one relief appearance -- despite failing to get a swing and miss in the first two innings for the first time this year. Eight of his nine swings and misses overall came on breaking balls, and Strasburg escaped a two-on, two-out jam in the fourth by striking out Carlos Correa.	After George Springer's one-out double put runners at second and third in the fifth, Jose Altuve struck out on a curve in the dirt and Michael Brantley hit a hard grounder to second.	"He has an uncanny ability to slow the game down when he's under any duress," Hinch said about Strasburg.	Sean Doolittle got the final two outs as the Nationals bullpen headed into Game 7 relatively rested.	Verlander dropped to 0-6 with a 5.68 ERA in seven Series starts, a blemish on his otherwise sterling career.	"I didn't really have great feel for the off-speed stuff," he said. "The last inning just a poorly executed slider and then really just kind of a fastball up and in."	Martinez's ejection came after Trea Turner was called out for interference when he ran on the fair side of the foul line and knocked the mitt off first baseman Yuli Gurriel in the seventh following his slow roller. Washington was leading 3-2 at the time and would have had runners on second and third with no outs.	Martinez tried to protest the game. Joe Torre, MLB's chief baseball officer, said the long delay that followed -- just over 10 minutes -- was caused by umpires at Minute Maid Park consulting with the replay room in New York to confirm the decision on the field was not subject to a protest.	Rendon's RBI single through a shifted infield put the Nationals ahead in the first, but Houston needed just four pitches to tie the score. Springer lined a double off the left-field scoreboard, at 112 mph off the bat the hardest-hit ball of the Series, and advanced on a wild pitch before scoring on Altuve's sacrifice fly.	Bregman's third homer of the Series put the Astros ahead on Strasburg's 12th pitch. He carried his bat out of the batter's box and tried to hand it to first base coach Don Kelly, only for the bat to fall as Kelly stuck out his hand for a shake.	Strasburg called Bregman's antics "tired."	"I just let my emotions get the best of me and it's not how I was raised to play the game," Bregman said. "I'm sorry for doing that."	Eaton tied the score in the fifth when Verlander hung a slider. Soto, who turned 21 on Friday, followed with his third home run of the Series.	Soto, too, flipped the bat at his first base coach, Tim Bogar.	"I just thought it was pretty cool," Soto said when asked if he was mimicking Bregman. "I wanted to do it."	---	More AP MLB coverage: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

Astros relief pitcher Will Harris voices his disappointment after giving up the go-ahead home run to Howie Kendrick in Game 7 of the World Series. (0:56)	HOUSTON -- Stephen Strasburg paraded the MVP trophy for delirious fans packed behind the dugout. Max Scherzer tearfully hugged his teammates. Gerardo Parra did the Baby Shark chop, Sean Doolittle flapped snow angels next to the mound.	Almost out of contention in May, champs in October.	Howie Kendrick, Anthony Rendon and the Washington Nationals completed their amazing comeback journey -- fittingly, with one last late rally on the road.	In Game 7 of the World Series, no less.	Kendrick and Rendon homered in the seventh inning as the Nationals overcame a two-run deficit, rocking the Houston Astros 6-2 Wednesday night to win the first title in franchise history.	With all eyes on Scherzer and his remarkable recovery after an injection of painkillers, these Nationals truly embraced their shot in the only Series when the road team won every game.	Even more against the odds: Juan Soto and Washington came from behind to win five elimination games this postseason, an unprecedented feat.	"What a story," said Ryan Zimmerman, the only player who's been a part of every Nationals team.	"The way this game went is the way our whole season went," he said.	Strasburg, new lefty Patrick Corbin and the Nats brought the first World Series championship to the nation's capital since ol' Walter Johnson delivered the crown for the Senators in 1924.	This franchise started out as the Montreal Expos in 1969 when the major leagues expanded beyond the border, putting a team with tricolor caps at jaunty Jarry Park. They moved to D.C. in 2005, ending Washington's three-decade-plus wait for big league baseball after the Senators left town to become the Texas Rangers.	But the incredible path these wild-card Nationals with the curly W logo took, well, no one could have imagined.	Because in one topsy-turvy week, they put aside the pain of past playoff failures.	"Resilient, relentless bunch of guys," manager Dave Martinez said. "They fought all year long."	Having lost star slugger Bryce Harper in free agency and beset by bullpen woes, Washington plummeted to 19-31 in late May. It got so bad there was talk around town the Nationals might fire Martinez and trade away Scherzer.	Instead, they stuck with the mantra that sprung up on T-shirts: Stay In The Fight.	"That was our motto," Scherzer said.	And months later, they finished it indeed.	"Guess what? We stayed in the fight. We won the fight!" Martinez shouted during the trophy celebration on the field.	"We were down and out. We were 19-31. We didn't quit then, we weren't going to quit now," he said.	Strasburg earned the MVP with a pair of wins, including Game 6.	"It's almost like we've done it so many times that we have to get punched in the face to kind of wake up," he said.	As pitcher Anibal Sanchez told Scherzer while hugging him in the middle of the diamond: "We won one. We finally won one."	For the 43,326 revved-up fans at Minute Maid Park, it was a combination of shock and disappointment. So close to seeing Jose Altuve, Alex Bregman, George Springer and their Astros add to the title they won in Game 7 at Dodger Stadium two years ago, they watched this chance suddenly vanish as Houston fell apart.	"I've got a group of heartbroken men in there that did everything they could to try to bring a World Series championship to this city. And we fell one win shy," Astros manager AJ Hinch said.	"Let's be honest, there's 28 other teams that would love to have our misery today. And I just told our team, it's hard to put into words and remember all the good that happened because right now we feel as bad as you can possibly feel."	President Donald Trump, greeted with chants of "Lock him up!" when he attended Game 5 in Washington, tweeted his congratulations to the Nationals.	"Game 7 was amazing!" Trump tweeted.	Washington kept pulling away after taking the lead, with the sensational Soto hitting an RBI single in the eighth and Adam Eaton adding a two-run single in the ninth.	Zack Greinke was in complete control with a one-hit shutout until Rendon -- a Houston prep and college star -- hit a solo homer with one out in the seventh that made it 2-1.	"Just gave us a little bit of hope," Nationals leadoff man Trea Turner said.	When Soto followed with a one-out walk, Hinch decided to make a move. He'd had ace starter Gerrit Cole warming up earlier, but left him in the bullpen.	"I wasn't going to pitch him unless we were going to win the World Series and have a lead," Hinch said. "He was going to close the game in the ninth."	Instead, Hinch signaled for reliable reliever Will Harris.	Kendrick connected on the second pitch, slicing a drive that hit the screen attached to the right field foul pole for a 3-2 lead. Just like that, everything had changed for the team in orange that led the majors with 107 regular-season wins, and the ballpark fell silent.	For Kendrick, another timely blow. At 36, playing on the oldest team in the majors, the journeyman was the National League Championship Series MVP against St. Louis after hitting the winning grand slam in the 10th inning of the deciding Game 5 in the division series at Dodger Stadium.	Then again, this was nothing new for the Nationals.	Washington rallied in the eighth to beat Milwaukee in the wild-card game and took the final two to beat Los Angeles in the NLDS, setting up a sweep of the Cardinals in the NLCS.	"This is now the most 2019 Nats thing to ever happen," Doolittle said. "Another elimination game, another come-from-behind win."	Far away, a sizable crowd poured into Nationals Park for a watch party. That was the stadium where Houston hammered the Nats for three games last weekend in taking a 3-2 edge, but the luck changed in Texas.	And the Nationals won the final two against a team that posted the best home record in the majors (60-21) over the past two seasons. Houston earned home-field advantage throughout the postseason, but it didn't help in the end as the Astros went a stunning 0-4 in their own ballpark during the Series.	"I hope D.C.'s ready for us to come home!" shouted Zimmerman, the Nationals' initial draft pick back in 2005.	Martinez said Soto, who turned 21 last week, celebrated with his first beer. Meanwhile, the skipper, who had a heart procedure six weeks ago and can't resume his six-cups-a-day coffee habit, headed back to the clubhouse for a special treat.	"I am," he said, "going to smoke a cigar."	With Greinke and Scherzer grunting on every pitch, Game 7 started as a classic duel.	Yuli Gurriel put the Astros ahead with a home run in the second and Carlos Correa added an RBI single off Scherzer that made it 2-0 in the fifth.	Scherzer was done after the fifth. Only a few days earlier, the three-time Cy Young Award winner had been unable to lift his right arm due to nerve irritation near his neck.	Corbin, the $140 million starter, threw three scoreless innings in relief.	Daniel Hudson, released by the Angels in March, closed it out for the Nationals, who made Houston pay for stranding so many runners all game. Hudson struck out Michael Brantley for the final out, then threw his glove to start the celebration.	Houston shares a spring training complex in Florida with the Nationals and reported to camp in February full of high hopes.	The Astros breezed to the American League West title, edged Tampa Bay in a five-game ALDS and topped the Yankees in the ALCS. They had a front-office fiasco in October, which led to the firing of an executive for a boorish rant at female reporters during a clubhouse celebration.	"Yeah, the ultimate goal is to win the World Series, and we fell short to a great team. You can't hang your head low about that," Springer said. "You move on and start getting ready for spring training."	WILD	The Nationals became the first wild-card team to win the Series since Madison Bumgarner and the Giants in 2014. Starting with San Francisco's win, the past six champs have clinched on the road.	UP NEXT	The Astros and Nationals start training side by side in a few months and open exhibition play with a World Series rematch on Feb. 22 at Ballpark of the Palm Beaches. They met in their Grapefruit League opener this year, and Scherzer gave up a home run to the first batter of the game.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.
