CHICAGO -- Stephen Strasburg gave Washington everything he had, and it was more than enough.	So much for all those questions about heart and character.	Strasburg shook off an illness and pitched seven dominant innings, Michael A. Taylor hit a late grand slam and the Nationals beat the Chicago Cubs 5-0 on Wednesday to send their NL Division Series to a decisive Game 5.	"I just focused on one pitch at a time and going as long as I could," Strasburg said.	Moments after Sean Doolittle closed out Strasburg's first career playoff win, the focus shifted to the final game of the series in Washington on Thursday night. Kyle Hendricks starts for the World Series champion Cubs after throwing seven sharp innings in a 3-0 victory over Strasburg in Game 1.	Washington manager Dusty Baker was non-committal when asked about his starter, with Gio Gonzalez and Tanner Roark the most likely candidates.	"You know, whoever it is, I hope they pitch like Stras did today," Baker said.	No kidding.	Strasburg got sick after his terrific performance in the playoff opener on Friday, and the Nationals had planned to go with Roark even after a persistent rain washed out Game 4 on Tuesday. That led to a flurry of comments and criticism about whether the ace had the right stuff to pitch in big moments.	But Strasburg felt better when he woke up Wednesday and told Baker he wanted the ball. That was all Baker needed to hear.	"I could see the focus and determination in his eyes, you know what I mean, when he came in the office and we talked to him," the manager said. "You know, he's a man of few words, but the words he said, you know, gave us every indication that he was ready."	Standing tall as clouds of mist rolled through Wrigley Field, Strasburg struck out 12 , allowed three hits and walked two. The No. 1 overall pick in the 2009 draft has 22 Ks in 14 innings in the series, allowing only a pair of unearned runs in the sixth in the opener.	"I like to think that any game that I pitch is the most important game," Strasburg said. "That's just how I tried to go into Game 4, and now we get a chance for a Game 5."	Chicago wasted a gutsy performance from Jake Arrieta and solid relief by Game 2 starter Jon Lester in its first home playoff loss since Game 4 of the World Series last year. NL MVP Kris Bryant struck out four times, and the defending champs went 0 for 6 with runners in scoring position.	"We just have to be offensively a little bit better tomorrow," Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. "They have been really good. We have been really good. Listen, they got a grand slam. Otherwise, it's kind of like the same game both sides."	Arrieta walked five in four innings in his return from a hamstring injury, but limited Washington to an unearned run and two hits. Lester got the Cubs all the way to the eighth, picking off Ryan Zimmerman before departing after Daniel Murphy's two-out single.	But Chicago's bullpen faltered from there. Carl Edwards Jr. walked two in a row and threw ball one to Taylor before he was replaced by Wade Davis. Taylor then drove a 1-1 pitch into the basket overhanging the brick wall in right field for his first career homer in the playoffs.	"I was kind of numb, just running around the bases," Taylor said. "Honestly, I didn't think it was going to get out the way the wind was blowing in."	Ryan Madson worked the eighth and Doolittle finished the three-hitter, giving the NL East champions a chance to avenge years of playoff heartache.	Washington also made it to the playoffs in 2012, 2014 and 2016 and fell in the first round each time, including five-game losses to St. Louis in 2012 and Los Angeles last season.	"Once you get out there, that stuff doesn't really matter," Taylor said. "What we did last year doesn't help or hurt us once we're in between the lines. We'll just go out there and play our game."	The Nationals jumped in front in the third, taking advantage of a Chicago error for the second straight game. Trea Turner doubled with one out for his first hit of the series and advanced on a wild pitch. Jayson Werth struck out looking before Arrieta walked Bryce Harper, putting runners on the corners.	Zimmerman followed with a slow roller to shortstop. Addison Russell charged the ball, but he couldn't bring it in.	It was Chicago's sixth error of the series, and reliever Brian Duensing picked up another one on an errant throw in the ninth. Left fielder Kyle Schwarber committed two errors on one play in Game 3, setting up Washington's only run in a 2-1 loss.	"It's two heavyweights going at it," Lester said. "We're going to the last round. We're going to figure it out. We've got Game 5 so it should be exciting TV. It should be exciting in our clubhouse."	---	Jay Cohen can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/jcohenap	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

Todd Frazier explains why the Yankees' Game 5 victory over the Indians was for Joe Girardi, who took a lot of criticism in the series. (0:37)	CLEVELAND --  These young Yankees were unshaken, resilient and as tough as the city they represent.	The baby Bronx Bombers have grown up fast.	Didi Gregorius, following in the October footprints left by Derek Jeter, homered twice off Corey Kluber as New York beat the Cleveland Indians 5-2 in Game 5 on Wednesday night to complete its comeback from a 2-0 deficit in the Division Series and dethrone the AL champions.	The bend-but-don't-break Yankees, way ahead of schedule, staved off elimination for the fourth time in this postseason and advanced to play the Houston Astros in the AL Championship Series starting Friday night at Minute Maid Park.	With a blend of young stars and older veterans coming up big, the Yankees rocked Cleveland and bailed out manager Joe Girardi, who failed to challenge a key call in a Game 2 loss that threatened to sabotage New York's season.	"These guys had my back and they fought and fought," Girardi said. "They beat a really good team. What those guys did for me, I'll never forget it. "	The Yankees went 2-5 against the AL West champion Astros, led by 5-foot-6 dynamo and MVP candidate Jose Altuve. But none of that matters now to this group of New Yorkers.	After winning twice at home, and after Girardi said he "screwed up" and felt horrible about it, the Yankees -- with little offensive help from rookie star Aaron Judge -- came into Progressive Field and finished off the Indians, who won 102 games during the regular season, ripped off a historic 22-game winning streak and were favored to get back to the World Series after losing in seven games a year ago to the Chicago Cubs.	Cleveland's Series drought turns 70 next year -- baseball's longest dry spell.	"Nobody wanted the season to be over," Indians manager Terry Francona said. "It doesn't wind down, it comes to a crashing halt. It's disappointing. We felt good about ourselves. We made it harder to win, especially in the last two games."	The Indians closed to 3-2 in the fifth against starter CC Sabathia before David Robertson pitched 2 2/3 hitless innings for the win. Yankees closer Aroldis Chapman, who faced Cleveland in last year's spine-tingling World Series and signed an $86 million free agent contract in December, worked two innings for the save.	Chapman went to the mound with a three-run lead in the ninth after Brett Gardner battled Cody Allen for 12 pitches before hitting an RBI single, with New York's fifth run scoring when Todd Frazier raced home on right fielder Jay Bruce's throwing error.	Gardner's gritty at-bat was symbolic of these Yankees. They wouldn't give in.	"We can win a lot of different ways," Gardner said.	When Austin Jackson was called out on strikes to end it, the Yankees rushed to the mound to celebrate with a wide-eyed Chapman. An elated Girardi hugged his coaches.	On Friday, Girardi was crestfallen, afraid he had wrecked the season.	"After Game 2, Joe came up to me in this same spot (outside the manager's office) and said, `Hey, man. I'm sorry," Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said. "I told him, `We just have to keep battling. Nothing is over yet.' No one on the plane home thought it was over at all."	The Yankees became the 10th team to overcome a 2-0 deficit to win a best-of-five playoff series. New York also did it in 2001, rallying to beat Oakland -- a series remembered for Jeter's backhand flip to home plate.	Gregorius, who took over at shortstop following Jeter's retirement after the 2014 season, hit a solo homer in the first off Kluber and added a two-run shot in the third off Cleveland's ace, who didn't look like himself during either start in this series.	One win shy of a Series title last year, the Indians had only one goal in mind in 2017.	They came up short again, and have now lost six consecutive games with a chance to clinch a postseason series. The skid dates to last year's World Series, when they squandered a 3-1 lead to the Cubs.	Cleveland is the first team in history to blow a two-game series lead in consecutive postseasons.	Everything was set up for the Indians: Kluber on the mound, Game 5 at home, sensational setup man Andrew Miller rested.	The Yankees, though, wouldn't be denied. They battled back from a 3-0 deficit in the first inning of their wild-card game against Minnesota and then had to overcome a crushing loss in Game 2, when Girardi's decisions led to him being booed at Yankee Stadium.	But these Yankees displayed pinstriped pride and pulled Girardi off the hook.	"I had a hole in my heart for about five or six days," he said.	It's healed now.	JUDGE NOT	The Yankees advanced without much help from Judge, who struck out four times in Game 5 and went 1 for 20 (.050) in the series with 16 strikeouts -- an ALDS record. But the 6-foot-7 rookie might have saved New York's season in Game 3, when he reached above the right-field wall to rob Francisco Lindor of a two-run homer in a 1-0 win. "I didn't do my job at the top of the order, but my teammates came up big for me," Judge said.	KLUBER KLOBBERED	Kluber was one of baseball's most consistent pitchers all season, winning 18 games and leading the AL with a 2.25 ERA.	However, October was cruel to the right-hander. He allowed nine runs, including four homers, over 6 1/3 innings in two postseason starts, hardly what he or the Indians expected.	Kluber overcame a back issue earlier this season and it flared up this fall.	"He's fighting a lot," Francona said. "I think you also have to respect the fact that guy wants to go out there and he's our horse. And sometimes it doesn't work."	SLUMPS	The Indians batted .171 as a team with All-Stars Francisco Lindor (2 for 18) and Jose Ramirez (2 for 20) unable to snap out of funks.	SWEET SWING	Gregorius set a franchise record for home runs in a season by a shortstop with 25, one more than Jeter hit in 1999 when No. 2 led the Yankees to a second straight World Series title.	Gregorius got New York off to an ideal start, homering with two outs in the first when Kluber grooved a fastball. The shot deep into the seats in right raised the anxiety level to an already jittery Cleveland crowd fearing the worst.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

WASHINGTON -- The Chicago Cubs win whenever they need to, with whatever it takes, even a seven-out save by Wade Davis to preserve a shrinking lead and a "Did that really happen?" four-run inning against Washington's Max Scherzer in a thriller of a Game 5.	That wild, bat-around fifth inning Thursday night for Chicago included Addison Russell's go-ahead, two-run double, a bases-loaded hit by pitch and a disputed dropped third strike followed by a throwing error, all of which helped the defending World Series champion Cubs come back -- and then hold on -- to edge the Nationals 9-8.	For the third year in a row, Chicago reached the NL Championship Series.	"Give the boys credit," Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. "That's one of the most incredible victories I've ever been part of. I know a lot of people are probably saying the same thing, but under the circumstances, in the other team's ballpark, after a tough loss at home, to come back and do that, give our guys all the credit in the world."	Russell drove in four runs, and Davis, Chicago's seventh pitcher, turned in his longest appearance since 2012.	"I've always known he's got a lot of mettle in his soul," Ben Zobrist, who scored two runs for Chicago, said of Davis. "The guy just shows up. He's got ice in his veins."	The same could be said for all of the Cubs.	They trailed 4-1, then led 8-4 and 9-6, in a game that lasted more than 4 1/2 hours and ended after midnight Friday.	"It was 'Bizarro World,' there's no question about it," Maddon said. "But it happens. It happens this time of the year."	Catcher Willson Contreras picked off Jose Lobaton at first base to quash a Washington threat in the eighth, and Davis fanned a swinging Bryce Harper for the final out.	"Just trying to stay focused and confident in the end," Davis said.	Chicago, which surpassed its total of eight runs from the first four games of the NL Division Series, advanced to face the Los Angeles Dodgers, who will start ace Clayton Kershaw at home in Game 1 of the NLCS on Saturday night.	For Maddon and the Cubs, this was the fourth consecutive victory in a win-or-be-eliminated postseason game. That includes three straight to end the 2016 World Series, when Chicago trailed the Cleveland Indians 3-1 before forcing a Game 7 won by the Cubs in 10 innings.	The Nationals, meanwhile, went one-and-done yet again: This is the fourth time in the past six years that the club won the NL East and lost its opening playoff series. And this is the third time in that span that Washington bowed out with a Game 5 NLDS loss at home; that also happened in 2012 against the St. Louis Cardinals and last year against the Dodgers.	This one was played exactly five years to the day after the decider against the Cardinals, which the Nationals lost 9-7 in Washington. Just like that night, the Nationals started Gio Gonzalez. Just like that night, Washington raced out to an early lead (6-0 then). And just like that night, Gonzalez had control problems and started giving back some of the edge.	"It was a series of bad events," Nationals manager Dusty Baker said. "It really hurts, you know, to lose like that, especially after what we went through all year long, and that was tough."	Homers by Daniel Murphy and Michael A. Taylor -- whose grand slam off Davis backed Stephen Strasburg's 12-strikeout masterpiece in Washington's 5-0 victory in Game 4 on Wednesday at Wrigley Field -- gave the hosts a 4-1 lead in the second against Cubs starter Kyle Hendricks.	But Gonzalez gave back two of those runs, so it was 4-3 as two-time Cy Young Award winner Scherzer entered for the fifth. He started Game 3 of this series, pushed back because of an injured right hamstring, and hadn't come out of the bullpen since 2013 with the Detroit Tigers.	"Huge. You look out there and you see Scherzer up there, and you think, 'One of the best, if not the best, pitcher out there on the mound,'" Russell said. "You kind of have to change your game plan, your approach."	By the time Scherzer's one inning was over, the Cubs had taken a 7-4 lead, and Russell had delivered the biggest hit. Chicago scored two earned runs and two unearned runs, on the strength of three hits, one hit by pitch, one intentional walk, a catcher's interference and one very odd play.	What could have been a potentially inning-ending strikeout turned into a run, as Javier Baez swung and missed, but the ball went under catcher Matt Wieters' glove and through his legs. When Wieters collected the ball, he threw it into right field for an error, then appeared to argue that the play should have been ruled over because Baez's follow-through carried the bat into the catcher's mask.	"This game's cruel sometimes," Scherzer said. "Just the way things can happen."	The play was not reviewable under the challenge rules.	"When the ball gets past him," plate umpire and crew chief Jerry Layne said, "in my judgment, he didn't have any more opportunity after he had a chance to field the ball. There was no further play that could have been made on it."	"The graze of the helmet didn't have anything to do, in my judgment, with anything at all, with that particular play," he said. "I got together and found everybody was in agreement. That's what we went with."	Russell made it 8-4 in the sixth on an RBI double when left fielder Jayson Werth tried to make a sliding catch but whiffed. Werth said he lost the ball in the lights.	"It feels," he said, summing up the night for Washington, "like if it could go wrong, it did."	The lead was 9-6 before Washington got one run in the seventh on Harper's sacrifice fly and one in the eighth on Taylor's RBI single.	But the Nationals wasted some opportunities. In the eighth, with two on and no outs, pinch hitter Adam Lind hit into a double play. Later in that inning, again with two men aboard, Lobaton was nailed by Contreras' snap throw for the third out. Lobaton was originally ruled safe, and the call was overturned on replay.	In the seventh, Ryan Zimmerman was up as the go-ahead run with two men on, but Davis struck him out. That was part of an 0-for-4, three-strikeout night for the first baseman who had a resurgent season, leading the Nationals with 36 homers and 108 RBIs.	That season is over for him and his team. The Cubs will play on.	"We've been through it," Zobrist said. "And in those situations, we tend to start believing we're going to get the job done, even if it doesn't look like we are."	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

HOUSTON --  Dallas Keuchel faced the New York Yankees in the postseason for the second time and the Houston Astros ace shut them down again.	Keuchel struck out 10 in seven scoreless innings to help Houston to a 2-1 victory on Friday night in the AL Championship Series opener.	"I think it's just pitch execution, and it's just been there more times than it hasn't against the Yankees," Keuchel said.	Keuchel threw six scoreless innings in a 3-0 win over New York in the 2015 AL wild card game.	He allowed four hits -- all singles -- and walked one to improve to 8-2 with a 1.09 ERA in eight starts against the Yankees in the regular season and postseason combined. He joined Nolan Ryan and Mike Scott as the only Astros pitchers to reach double digits in strikeouts in a postseason game.	"Late movement -- he moves the ball and he commands it well," the Yankees Greg Bird said.	Carlos Correa and Yuli Gurriel hit RBI singles in the fourth off loser Masahiro Tanaka, and left fielder Marwin Gonzalez threw out Bird at the plate trying to score on Aaron Judge's two-out single in the fifth.	"We had a shot," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "If Bird's safe maybe we really get to him in that inning."	Bird homered off Ken Giles with two outs in the ninth, and the closer struck out pinch-hitter Jacoby Ellsbury . Giles, who threw a season-high 37 pitches, escaped a two-out jam in the eighth by striking out Didi Gregorius .	Greeted by MVP chants each time to the plate, Jose Altuve had three more hits and at 11 for 19 (.579) has the most hits in a team's first five postseason games since Seattle's Ichiro Suzuki in 2001.	Houston is in the Championship Series for the first time since beating St. Louis in 2005. The Yankees, who overcame a 2-0 deficit to beat Cleveland in the Division Series, lost their sixth straight ALCS game since 2010.	After the Astros totaled eight runs in the first innings of their four AL Division Series games, Tanaka kept the Astros hitless until Altuve's infield single rolled through the pitcher's legs in the fourth. Altuve swiped second before scoring on Correa's single. Gurriel followed with a two-out single, his 10th hit of the postseason.	Bird singled to start the fifth and Matt Holliday, making his first appearance of the postseason, reached when Altuve dropped his slow bouncer to second for an error. Judge singled with two outs and Gonzalez, throwing with such force that he fell to the ground, made a 97 mph one-hop throw to catcher Brian McCann, who tagged the sliding Bird.	"That was their best moment in the game, (I needed) to stop the momentum," Gonzalez said. "All I was thinking was to go get the ball as fast as I could."	The call was confirmed in a video review.	"I'm too slow. I wish I was a little faster," Bird said.	Primarily an infielder, Gonzalez had just two outfield assists in the regular season. He beat his hand into his glove three times in celebration after watching McCann make the tag.	"It's one of the best throws I've ever seen from an outfielder," Correa said. "Long hop, low tag right there. It was just perfect. Unbelievable."	Gonzalez threw out Boston's Mitch Moreland at the plate in the Division Series finale and is the first outfielder with assists in consecutive postseason games since Jim Rice in the 1986 World Series. He joined Lance Berkman as the only players in franchise history to have two outfield assists in one postseason.	After controversially failing to challenge a call in Game 2 of the Division Series, Girardi didn't hesitate to ask for a review.	"We thought he was out," he said. "But God knows I'm not doing that again."	UP NEXT	Yankees: Luis Severino will make his third start of this postseason on Saturday. Severino yielded three runs and four hits in seven innings of a win in Game 4 of the ALDS to bounce back after allowing three runs and getting just one out in the wild-card game.	"I feel good, I feel confident in myself," he said. "I knew that that first start I did, that wasn't me, and I made adjustments. That's how we do it; we make adjustments and the second start I put in place those adjustments and did good."	Astros: Justin Verlander is scheduled to make his 18th playoff start on Saturday. Verlander got the win in Game 1 of the ALDS against the Red Sox and picked up win No. 2 of this postseason when he made his first career relief appearance in Game 4. He's 9-5 with a 3.36 ERA and 115 strikeouts in his postseason career.	GAME 3	Manager A.J. Hinch announced that Charlie Morton will start Game 3 and that Lance McCullers, a starter who pitched in relief in the ALDS, could pitch Game 4. The Yankees will start CC Sabathia in Game 3 and Sonny Gray in Game 4.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

HOUSTON --  With each stinging line drive, Jose Altuve is putting his stamp on this October. Same with every pitch from Justin Verlander, no matter the inning or score.	Houston's longest tenured player and its durable new ace -- an incomparable pair so far this postseason.	Altuve raced home on Carlos Correa's double in the ninth inning, Verlander struck out 13 in a complete game and the Astros beat the New York Yankees 2-1 Saturday for a 2-0 lead in the AL Championship Series.	Correa also homered , but Houston needed a daring dash from the 5-foot-6 Altuve to get Verlander a win. Altuve, an AL MVP front-runner, reached with a one-out single against closer Aroldis Chapman, then sprinted around from first base on Correa's shot to right-center field. Shortstop Didi Gregorius' relay beat Altuve to the plate, but catcher Gary Sanchez misplayed a short-hop, allowing Houston's dynamo second baseman to slide past safely.	"When I saw him running I was like, `Oh God," Correa said. "And then obviously he beat it out."	Altuve had two more hits and is 13 for 23 (.565) this postseason after hitting just 4 for 26 (.154) in the 2015 playoffs.	"He's unbelievable," Verlander said. "The guy does everything."	Verlander improved to 8-0 in eight appearances with Houston since agreeing to an Aug. 31 trade from the Tigers, including his Game 4 win in relief during a Division Series against Boston. He has a 2.04 ERA over a postseason-leading 17 2/3 innings.	"When I decided to say yes, these are the moments that you envision," Verlander said of agreeing to the trade. "You don't envision going 5-0 in the regular season once you get here, that's all fine and great, but that's not why I was brought here. I was brought here to help this team win a championship."	Verlander set a postseason career best for strikeouts and allowed five hits in his second career complete game in the playoffs. He threw a season-high 124 pitches and retired baby Bronx Bombers Aaron Judge, Sanchez and Greg Bird in the top of the ninth.	"This is such a big moment for our team, but he put us on his back today with his pitching," manager A.J. Hinch said.	Dallas Keuchel won Game 1 for the Astros -- also 2-1 -- pairing with Verlander to give the Astros perhaps the best 1-2 punch in these playoffs.	"That was one of the most impressive things I've seen in my professional career for sure," Keuchel said. "But that's why we got him -- for his postseason pedigree."	In the bottom of the ninth, Judge picked up Correa's hit in right field and threw toward second base. Gregorius fielded there, and his throw beat Altuve to the plate by a few steps. Sanchez just couldn't squeeze the one-hopper.	"That's a play I'm used to making," Sanchez said through a translator. "Really thought I had a chance at making that play there. Unfortunately I dropped the ball and couldn't make that play."	The Astros mobbed Correa in shallow center field while Altuve pointed and smiled from near home plate.	Houston took its first ever 2-0 lead in a Championship Series in front of a crowd of 43,193 which included Houston Rockets stars James Harden, Chris Paul and Trevor Ariza in front-row seats. Minute Maid Park buzzed throughout, and fans let out huge cheer when Hinch sent Verlander back out to pitch the ninth.	"No words were necessary," Verlander said. "It was my game to win or lose."	Verlander got the first complete game by any pitcher this reliever-heavy postseason and his first nine-inning outing since his Tigers beat the Astros 3-2 on July 30, 2016. This was the seventh time Verlander had 10 or more strikeouts in the postseason, extending his major league record, and his seventh postseason game with 120 pitches or more.	The unshakable right-hander struck out the side in the eighth, and television shots showed fianc�e Kate Upton in a pink sequined shirt cheering and clapping wildly as he walked off.	Verlander, Keuchel and two relievers have combined to strike out 27 Yankees in the series.	"They're making pitches on these kids," New York manager Joe Girardi said. "And maybe are they trying a little bit too hard? Yeah, of course. But I think everyone out there's probably trying a little bit too hard."	Correa's homer in the fourth off starter Luis Severino sailed just out of reach of Judge and 12-year-old Carson Riley, who was sitting in the front row in right field. The ball bounced off Riley's glove and into the stands, and Girardi asked for a video review to check for fan interference. Umpires upheld the call.	Riley hopes to get the ball signed by Correa and called the moment: "A really cool one."	It was reminiscent of a homer by Derek Jeter in Game 1 of the 1996 ALCS between the Yankees and Orioles. A 12-year-old Jeffrey Maier reached out and deflected Jeter's hit into the stands, but umpires ruled it a home run.	The 23-year-old Correa is the fifth player ever with five home runs in the postseason before turning 24.	Todd Frazier drove in New York's run with a ground-rule double in the fifth when his shot to left-center got stuck in the chain-link fence protecting the visitors' bullpen. Center fielder George Springer tossed his glove in the air several times attempting to knock the ball loose, but never got close.	Severino allowed two hits and a run in four innings. He was hit by a comebacker from Yuli Gurriel on the last out of the fourth, and Girardi said they lifted him as a precaution.	Tommy Kahnle and David Robertson threw two scoreless innings each for New York before Chapman allowed his first run in 18 2/3 innings.	Verlander got out of the third inning unscathed thanks to two big defensive plays. The first came when Josh Reddick made a leaping catch before crashing into the low wall in right field to rob Chase Headley of a hit for the second out of the inning.	Verlander raised his right fist into the air after the catch before pounding it into his glove several times to acknowledge Reddick's work.	Brett Gardner followed with a rip to the corner of right field, but was thrown out trying to stretch it into a triple. Reddick threw it to Correa, whose one-hop to third base was just in time for Alex Bregman to tag Gardner out. He was initially ruled safe, but Bregman was so confident in his tag that he walked off the field as soon as the play was done. Hinch challenged, and it was quickly overturned.	UP NEXT	Yankees: CC Sabathia will start Game 3 on Monday in New York. It will be his third start this postseason and 21st career playoff start. The 37-year-old lefty allowed eight hits and six runs -- four earned -- with 14 strikeouts across 9 2/3 innings in two starts in the ALDS.	Astros: Charlie Morton is scheduled to pitch for Houston in Game 3. He allowed seven hits and two runs in 4 1/3 innings of Houston's 5-4 win over the Red Sox in Game 4 of the ALDS.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

Joe Maddon addresses the overturned call that resulted in the Dodgers' Charlie Culberson scoring in the seventh. (1:21)	LOS ANGELES -- Although Clayton Kershaw once again failed to dominate in a postseason start, these Los Angeles Dodgers don't need one guy to carry them.	With a relentless lineup, flawless relief pitching and a collective charisma epitomized by the bat-flipping Yasiel Puig, the Dodgers are still unbeaten in the postseason and off to a strong start in the NL Championship Series.	Chris Taylor hit a tiebreaking homer in the sixth inning, Puig added a homer and an RBI double to his dynamite postseason, and the Dodgers overcame a short start by Kershaw for a 5-2 victory over the Chicago Cubs on Saturday night in the NLCS opener.	"We just tried to set the tone early against the Cubs," closer Kenley Jansen said. "We understand they're the defending champions, so they're a really good team. We understand that we won 104 games, but right now it doesn't matter."	Charlie Culberson doubled, drove in the tying run and scored another while replacing injured All-Star shortstop Corey Seager for the resourceful Dodgers, who improved to 4-0 in this postseason."	With another collective offensive effort and four innings of perfect relief for Kershaw, the Dodgers calmly overcame an early two-run deficit and took the first game of this rematch of the 2016 NLCS, won in six games by the Cubs on the way to their first World Series championship in 108 years.	"It's two different ballclubs," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. "There are some similar players, but I think that the season we had versus the season they had last year, I think that you could parallel those two, and the confidence we have in our group, and they had in their group last year. I just know that this year we're a very focused group, very confident group."	The Dodgers hadn't won the opening game of an NLCS since 1985. Game 2 is Sunday, with Rich Hill starting at home against Chicago's Jon Lester.	Kershaw pitched five innings of four-hit ball, but the Los Angeles ace fell behind 2-0 before getting pulled for a pinch-hitter during the Dodgers' tying rally.	After winning 104 games in the regular season and sweeping Arizona in the Division Series, the Dodgers have a lineup and bullpen equipped to handle almost anything. They made Kershaw's latest laborious postseason start virtually irrelevant, just as they did after he gave up four homers in his 2017 playoff opener against the Diamondbacks last week.	Albert Almora Jr. hit a two-run homer in the fourth, but the final 18 batters failed to reach base for the weary Cubs, still bouncing back from a 10-hour cross-country flight after finishing off Washington in an epic Game 5 late Thursday night.	"Their bullpen is pretty firm, and we have to really get our feet back on the ground," Cubs manager Joe Maddon said.	Puig added another huge offensive game to his recent surge with his first career postseason homer -- though in a postgame interview on TBS, he was convinced he had hit one before.	The Cuban slugger also included his usual array of creative bat discards and portentous pauses at the plate.	Los Angeles finally got rolling in the fifth when Logan Forsythe and Austin Barnes drew one-out walks before Puig hammered a double to left-center. The ebullient Cuban slugger headed to second only after flipping his bat and spreading his arms wide at the plate.	Puig's sky-high homer off Mike Montgomery in the sixth barely got over the fence in left. Puig is 7 for 15 with six RBI in the Dodgers' first four playoff games.	"I grew up a little bit," Puig said. "(I'm) going to home plate having fun, because I know (if) I hit nothing, (if) I do nothing in the game, my teammates are going to have my back."	Kenta Maeda got three outs and the victory in his latest standout relief effort, and Jansen struck out all four batters he faced for his third save this postseason.	Kershaw's inability to match his sublime regular-season performances in the playoffs is a central theme of his career. The three-time NL Cy Young Award winner won the NLDS series opener last week despite giving up four homers at Dodger Stadium, and Almora's shot made him the first Dodgers pitcher to yield five homers in a single postseason.	CLOSE CALL	Maddon was ejected in the seventh after a call at the plate was reversed. Culberson initially was ruled out when he attempted to score from second, but was called safe after video review when catcher Willson Contreras was deemed to be in violation of blocking home plate without the ball.	"I saw a great baseball play," Maddon said. "His technique was absolutely 100 percent perfect. I could not disagree more with the interpretation of that."	GOOD START	Jose Quintana pitched five innings of two-hit ball for the Cubs one day after his wife, Michel, was taken off the team plane in Albuquerque with a medical ailment. But the Dodgers tied it against him in the fifth and went ahead in the sixth with Taylor's leadoff shot off loser Hector Rondon.	Despite pitching for the third time in six days after a start and a relief appearance against Washington, Quintana retired 12 of Los Angeles' first 13 batters.	SEAGER OUT	Seager was left off the NLCS roster due to back pain. The All-Star's surprise absence deprived Los Angeles of its No. 2 hitter and prompted the club to play Culberson, who had only 15 big league plate appearances in the regular season. But Culberson came through with a series of big plays at the plate and on the basepaths.	UP NEXT	Cubs: Lester won Game 5 of the 2016 NLCS at Dodger Stadium. He started Game 2 of the Division Series this year and added 3 2/3 innings of relief in Game 4 on Wednesday, but the veteran lefty compared that relief appearance to normal side work between starts. Lester's nine career postseason victories are the most among active pitchers except Justin Verlander, who picked up No. 10 in Houston earlier Saturday.	Dodgers: Hill is a former Cubs pitcher with just one career postseason victory, but the resilient veteran regularly comes through in tough situations for LA. He made it through just four innings in Game 2 against Arizona, but yielded only two runs.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

Cubs manager Joe Maddon explains his decision to send John Lackey out to pitch in the bottom of the ninth inning, when Lackey served up Justin Turner's walk-off homer. (0:40)	LOS ANGELES --  Justin Turner savored every last stride as he followed in Kirk Gibson's famous footsteps at Dodger Stadium.	The red-bearded slugger from Southern California knew all about the history attached to this home run trot.	On the 29th anniversary of Gibson's celebrated pinch-hit homer that shocked Oakland in the 1988 World Series opener, Turner added another landmark shot to Los Angeles Dodgers postseason lore.	Turner hit a three-run drive with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning, and the Dodgers beat the Chicago Cubs 4-1 on Sunday to take a 2-0 lead in the NL Championship Series.	"One of my earliest baseball memories was being at my grandma's house and watching that game in '88 and seeing Gibby hit that homer," said Turner, who wasn't quite 4 years old at the time. "So yeah, it feels pretty cool. I thought about doing the fist-pump around the bases, but we'll wait until we get to the World Series for that, hopefully."	The dominant Dodgers are two wins away after Turner drove in all four runs in Game 2 to keep Los Angeles unbeaten in the postseason.	He delivered a tying single in the fifth before sending a long shot to center field off John Lackey in the ninth. Completing the poetry of the moment, a fan wearing a blue Dodgers jersey took a few steps onto a walkway and gracefully caught the ball in his glove on the fly.	"It's very cool, and J.T., we were talking about it in there after the game," Los Angeles manager Dave Roberts said. "Twenty-nine years to the day. It was special. Our guys feel it."	Another generation of Dodgers fans now has its own historic homer, and these Dodgers are growing increasingly confident they can earn their first trip to the World Series since 1988.	Turner got swallowed up at home plate by another pack of ecstatic Dodgers, just as Gibson did. Unlike Gibson, Turner spiked his batting helmet after rounding third, allowing his unruly red hair to go as wild as the crowd.	"What's not to enjoy about it?" Turner asked. "We have an opportunity to bring a championship back to LA. It's been a long time."	Game 3 in the best-of-seven series is Tuesday night at Wrigley Field in Chicago. Midseason acquisition Yu Darvish starts for the Dodgers against Kyle Hendricks.	Yasiel Puig drew his third walk of the game leading off the ninth, and Charlie Culberson bunted him to second. After losing pitcher Brian Duensing struck out pinch-hitter Kyle Farmer, Chicago manager Joe Maddon went to the bullpen for the 38-year-old Lackey, who pitched on consecutive days for the first time in his 15-year career.	Lackey got the call over All-Star closer Wade Davis, and the veteran starter walked Chris Taylor on six tense pitches. Maddon said he wanted to save Davis for a potential save on the road, and Lackey would have pitched the 10th inning as well if the Cubs did not have a lead.	"Nobody is a really great matchup against Turner, so it just did not work out," Maddon said.	Turner stepped up and ended it with his fourth career playoff homer. After taking a slight free-agent discount to stay with the Dodgers last winter, he had another solid season before excelling again in October.	The All-Star third baseman is batting .377 with 22 RBI in his postseason career. He is 13 for 18 with runners in scoring position (.722), including 6 for 8 this year.	And after a collective offensive effort drove the Dodgers to a 5-2 win in Game 1, Turner did it all in Game 2. He has 10 RBI in the Dodgers' five postseason games, getting five in the playoff opener against Arizona.	Addison Russell homered in the fifth for the Cubs, who are down early in this rematch of the 2016 NLCS. Chicago won that series in six games after splitting the first two.	Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen got the win with a hitless ninth despite hitting Anthony Rizzo on the hand with a one-out pitch. That ended the Los Angeles bullpen's impressive streak of 22 straight Cubs retired to begin the NLCS, but the Dodgers have thrown eight hitless and scoreless innings of relief in the NLCS.	Jon Lester yielded three hits and five walks while failing to get out of the fifth inning in the shortest start of his long postseason career, but the Dodgers couldn't take advantage of a rare shaky night by the Cubs' star left-hander.	Rich Hill struck out eight in five more impressive innings for the Dodgers, but he was pulled for pinch-hitter Curtis Granderson in the fifth in a debatable decision by Roberts.	Russell was off to a 4-for-22 start in the postseason with nine strikeouts before the slugging shortstop put a leadoff homer into the short porch in left field.	Turner tied it moments later by poking a two-out single to right after a leadoff double by Culberson, the Dodgers' improbably successful replacement for injured All-Star shortstop Corey Seager.	The Dodgers chased Lester with two outs in the fifth, but reliever Carl Edwards Jr. came through after several recent postseason struggles, striking out pinch-hitter Chase Utley and then pitching a strong sixth.	Lester was the co-MVP of last season's NLCS, winning Game 5 at Dodger Stadium and yielding two runs over 13 innings in the series. He had nothing near the same success against the Dodgers' revamped lineup in this one, issuing four walks in the first four innings and repeatedly escaping jams.	Dodgers third base coach Chris Woodward held up Turner in the third when it appeared he could have scored from first on Cody Bellinger's double to the left-center gap.	Javier Baez, the other co-MVP of last season's NLCS for Chicago, got to third base in the third with one out, but also was stranded.	UP NEXT	Cubs: Hendricks dominated Chicago's playoff opener with seven scoreless innings against the Nationals, but yielded four runs in four innings during the team's wild Game 5 victory in Washington. He is starting on normal rest.	Dodgers: Darvish was outstanding in Game 3 against the Diamondbacks, earning his first career postseason victory with seven strikeouts over five innings of two-hit ball. He was acquired from Texas precisely for these moments, and he starts on seven days of rest.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

Aaron Judge speaks with Buster Olney about what Todd Frazier does for the Yankees and breaks down his grab against the wall and his three-run homer in New York's Game 3 victory. (1:02)	NEW YORK --  Back in the Bronx, the big guys delivered.	Greeted by an array of "All Rise" signs in a ballpark that fits their style, Aaron Judge hit a three-run homer and made a pair of sparkling catches, leading CC Sabathia and the New York Yankees over the Houston Astros 8-1 Monday night and cutting their deficit to 2-1 in the AL Championship Series.	Todd Frazier hit a go-ahead, three-run homer into the short porch in right field in the second inning against Charlie Morton.	The 6-foot-7 Judge entered in a 4-for-31 (.129) postseason slump that included one home run, four RBI and 19 strikeouts. The slugger capped a five-run fourth with a laser of a drive to left field off Will Harris and robbed Yuli Gurriel and Cameron Maybin of extra-base hits.	"You see a guy put his head basically through the wall and then dive," Frazier said. "The ground is going to shake when he hits the ground."	Sabathia, almost as big at 6-foot-6, allowed three hits over six scoreless innings  for his first postseason win in five years. The Yankees stopped a seven-game ALCS losing streak dating to Sabathia's victory over Texas in 2010 -- when Judge had just started his freshman year at Fresno State.	After a pair of 2-1 losses in Houston, the Yankees led 8-0 after four innings.	"Just the energy, the fans," Sabathia said. "We can kind of feed off their energy."	New York improved to 4-0 at home this postseason. The Yankees were an AL-best 51-30 at home this season.	"We're somewhat built for this ballpark," manager Joe Girardi said.	Houston scored on a bases-loaded walk in the ninth before postseason star Jose Altuve grounded into a game-ending double play with the bases loaded.	Sonny Gray starts Game 4 for New York in the best-of-seven series on 11 days' rest Wednesday against Lance McCullers Jr.	Frazier got the Yankees rolling, taking an awkward hack at a low, outside fastball and slicing an opposite-field drive over the right-field scoreboard.	"You don't think it's going, just because how unorthodox the swing was," Frazier said.	Judge used his height and long left arm to make a leaping catch with his left shoulder slamming into the right-field wall against Gurriel starting the fourth.	Being a rookie, he politely waited outside the dugout for all the veterans to descend the steps after the third out -- as he always does -- then capped a five-run bottom half with a laser of a line drive that just cleared the left-field wall.	Then in the fifth, he sprinted into short right for a diving backhand catch on Maybin.	On the first chilly night of the autumn with a game-time temperature of 57, Sabathia relied on the sharp, slow slider that has helped revive the former flamethrower's career.	Pitching with caution to Houston's dangerous lineup, he walked four, struck out five and pitched shutout ball for the first time in 21 career postseason starts. During the regular season, he was 9-0 in 10 starts following Yankees' losses.	"It's weird, me being 37, smoke and mirrors, getting a shutout," Sabathia said.	Adam Warren followed with two hitless innings, Dellin Betances walked his only two batters and Tommy Kahnle finished. Houston had four hits, leaving it with just 15 over the first three games, and is batting .169 in the matchup.	Morton was chased after 3 2/3 innings and allowed seven runs and six hits: three infield singles, a bloop single to center, a double that Maybin allowed to fall in left and Frazier's homer.	"If you were to show me a video of the swing, show the pitch speed and the location, I would have never thought that," Morton said. "That was unbelievable."	A New Jersey native who grew up a Yankees fan, Frazier entered 7 for 18 against Morton with two home runs. With Frank Sinatra's version of "Fly Me to the Moon" as his walk-up music, Frazier hit not-quite a moonshot, driving a pitch just 18 1/2 inches above the dirt 365 feet with pretty much just his left arm. That gave the Yankees their first lead of the series.	Frazier motioned to his family in the stands and looked at his left wrist.	"I'm pointing to them and saying: What time is it? It's my time," he said.	He remembers sitting in the seats at old Yankee Stadium watching Jim Leyritz's 15th-inning home beat Seattle in the 1995 playoffs.	"It's such a cool feeling," Frazier said. "I wish everybody could feel basically what I'm going through."	Houston loaded the bases with two outs in the third on a pair of two-out walks around Alex Bregman's single. But Carlos Correa popped out on a fastball in on his fists.	"I know he likes to get his hands extended," Sabathia said.	Sabathia raised both arms and pointed toward Judge after his catch in the fourth.	"I don't know what got hurt worse, the wall or him," plate umpire Gary Cederstrom was heard to say by one of Fox's microphones.	New York broke open the game in the bottom half. Chase Headley hit a run-scoring infield single -- ending an 0-for-28 slide by New York designated hitters in the postseason. Brett Gardner was hit on a leg by a pitch, loading the bases, and Harris came in and threw a wild pitch that allowed Frazier to come home from third.	"Judge did what Judge has done 50-plus times, which is hit the ball out of the ballpark when he gets a pitch to hit," Astros manager A.J. Hinch said.	ALTUVE'S WEB GEMS	Altuve made two fine stops on Did Gregorius, first a backhand stop on his third-inning grounder and then a shuffle pass to Harris covering first for the final out of the fourth after a hard grounder off first baseman Marwin Gonzalez's glove.	APPLAUSE	Girardi, booed by fans after failing to call for a replay in Game 2 of the Division Series, was cheered when introduced.	"It's a reminder of how quickly things can change in your life," he said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: RHP Luis Severino is on track to pitch a Game 6. He was removed after four innings and 62 pitches in Game 2 because Girardi felt he was "underneath" the ball. Girardi said Severino did not need any tests and is OK.	Asked whether Severino was understanding, Girardi said: "I think two days later, yes, a little bit more."	"I asked him if he still hated me, and he said, `no," Girardi added.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

NEW YORK --  With a soaring shot headed for Monument Park, Aaron Judge got New York back on course for another memorable October.	Yankee Stadium sounds like it's ready, too.	"That ballpark is alive," Judge said after this latest rousing rally.	Judge ignited a comeback with a home run , then hit a tying double during a four-run eighth inning to spur the unflappable Yankees over the Houston Astros 6-4 Tuesday night and tie the AL Championship Series 2-2.	The Baby Bombers trailed 4-0 against starter Lance McCullers Jr. until Judge homered leading off the seventh. He tied it with a line drive that nearly left the park in the eighth and scored when Gary Sanchez hit a go-ahead two-run double off loser Ken Giles.	"I didn't know what to do after I touched home plate," Judge said. "I can't describe it."	The Yankees overcame three errors and have roared back from a second straight 0-2 series deficit -- they beat Cleveland in the Division Series by winning three in a row to take that best-of-five matchup.	Aroldis Chapman struck out two in a perfect ninth to cap a three-hitter and get the save . Before a sellout crowd of 48,804, New York improved to 5-0 at home in the playoffs and won for the 18th time in its last 21 home games.	"Every home game has been special," manager Joe Girardi said. "I just feel like the fans are back. And I see things that I haven't in a while, and it reminds me a lot of when I was playing here."	Yankee Stadium will be rocking again when Masahiro Tanaka pitches for New York against Dallas Keuchel in Game 5 Wednesday. It's a rematch of the series opener, when Keuchel outdid the Japanese right-hander in a 2-1 Astros win.	An AL MVP candidate mired in a sluggish October, Judge sparked the Yankees by chasing McCullers, who baffled the Yankees with his power breaking ball.	Except for the last one.	Judge launched a curveball into the netting above center field's Monument Park for New York's second hit.	"I thought Aaron's home run just lit a little spark," Girardi said.	Houston manager A.J. Hinch pulled McCullers after 81 pitches, Didi Gregorius tripled off Chris Devenski and Sanchez brought Gregorius in with a sacrifice fly.	Todd Frazier led off the eighth with a single to left, and pinch-hitter Chase Headley, in a 1-for-18 postseason slide, singled. He lost his balance stepping on first, fell en route to second, then took a step back before continuing on and getting his left hand in ahead of Jose Altuve's tag.	"Just stumbled and stumbled and stumbled and finally went down," Headley said. "I went from one of the best feelings of my career to one of the worst in just a matter of seconds."	Headley was awarded second after a video review, and the ballpark boomed when crew chief Gary Cederstrom gave the signal. It got so loud that on-deck hitter Brett Gardner said he "kind of blacked out for a second."	Gardner brought in Frazier on a groundout, and Judge came to bat with the bundled, buzzing crowd on its feet.	He lunged for a low slider and drilled a double high off the left-field wall as a fan in a longsleeve yellow shirt reached down and touched the ball. Pinch-runner Jacoby Ellsbury came home with the tying run, and Gregorius grounded a single just beyond shortstop Carlos Correa's reach to put runners at the corner. Sanchez, who had been 0 for 13 in the series, scored them both with a slicing drive that skipped to the wall in right-center.	"Those guys came up big for us today," Girardi said.	Judge had multiple hits for the first time since the AL wild-card game against Minnesota. He's still just 7 for 37 with 22 strikeouts in the playoffs, but he's 4 for 13 (.308) with three walks in the ALCS. He also homered in an 8-1 Game 3 win.	Judge said he used to dream about postseason at-bats in Yankee Stadium as a minor leaguer.	"The dreams aren't the same as reality," he said. "To be out with the crowd and the atmosphere, it was unbelievable."	The 35-minute bottom of the eighth was the latest stunning comeback for New York, which has overcome deficits of three or more 11 times this year, including in the wild-card game against Minnesota.	Houston had not lost consecutive games since Sept. 8-10 at Oakland and had the major leagues' best road record during the regular season. The Astros are hitting .153 in the series.	"We're not going to hit the panic button because we lost two games in a row," Correa said. "We got Keuchel going tomorrow."	McCullers cruised in his first start since Sept. 30 and turned over a 4-1 lead to his bullpen.	"He was awesome," manager A.J. Hinch said. "And really proud of him because I know how important this start was for him."	Yankees starter Sonny Gray pitched one-hit ball through five innings. His teammates have yet to score for him in four career postseason starts while he's still on the mound, including twice with New York this year.	Houston took a 3-0 lead in the sixth after George Springer walked leading off and Josh Reddick reached on catcher's interference by Austin Romine -- inserted into lineup for his defense.	Yuli Gurriel lined a three-run double off David Robertson for a 3-0 lead in the sixth and second baseman Starlin Castro misplayed Brian McCann's seventh-inning grounder for his second error, allowing Marwin Gonzalez to score from second.	Winner Chad Green gave up an unearned run over two innings.	"All of a sudden, the pressure's back on the other team," Frazier said. "It's the best place to play and the loudest place in baseball to play. No doubt about it."	OUT, SAFE, OUT	The fourth inning ended strangely . Judge was doubled off first on Sanchez's popup, but the Yankees successfully challenged that Judge beat first baseman Gurriel to the base. Houston then appealed that Judge missed retouching second on his way back to first. Judge -- realizing he would be called out on the challenge -- decided to race McCullers' appeal throw to second and was tagged out. He would have voided the appeal attempt if he had beaten the throw.	"The coaching staff kind of gave me a heads up," Judge said. "So I said, `All right, let's go. Got to try something."	Adding to the strangeness: throughout the challenge, McCullers was digging around the mound with his hands, scooping up beads off his necklace, which broke during the play.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tanaka has been receiving treatment on his leg after being struck by Reddick's liner in Game 1. He did not expect it to be an issue Wednesday.	---	Follow Jake Seiner on Twitter: https://twitter.com/jake-seiner	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

After hitting a home run in his first postseason start in two years, Andre Ethier was just happy to be in the game. (1:39)	CHICAGO --  The Los Angeles Dodgers have a tough lineup, a talented pitching staff and a manager making all the right moves.	Yup, it's beginning to look a lot like 1988.	Yu Darvish pitched sparkling ball into the seventh inning, Chris Taylor homered again and the Dodgers beat the Chicago Cubs 6-1 on Tuesday night to open a 3-0 lead in the NL Championship Series.	Andre Ethier also went deep and Taylor added an RBI triple in the fifth as Los Angeles improved to 6-0 in this postseason, setting a franchise record for consecutive playoff wins. Yasiel Puig had two more hits in another entertaining performance that included an impressive bat flip -- on a long foul ball in the first inning.	"The focus has certainly been heightened in the postseason," manager Dave Roberts said.	Looking for a four-game sweep and their 22nd pennant, the Dodgers will send Alex Wood to the mound Wednesday night at Wrigley Field with a chance to reach the World Series for the first time since Hall of Famer Tommy Lasorda managed Kirk Gibson, Orel Hershiser and Co. to the club's last championship 29 years ago.	Jake Arrieta, eligible for free agency after the season, pitches for the Cubs in what could be his final start with the team.	"I think we've won four games in a row before," Chicago slugger Kris Bryant said. "Obviously, it's going to be a tougher road. But it'll make the story that much better. Can you imagine that?"	Los Angeles was eliminated by Chicago in the NLCS last year, but this is a different group of Dodgers. Their patient lineup is coming up big in key spots and the pitching staff is much deeper, especially since Darvish was acquired in a trade with Texas in the final minutes before the July 31 deadline.	Not even a return to Wrigley could get the Cubs back on track after a rough stay in Los Angeles. Chicago manager Joe Maddon juggled his lineup, inserting Kyle Schwarber into the No. 2 slot and benching slumping second baseman Javier Baez, but the defending World Series champions were shut down by another Dodgers starter and more stellar relief from the NL West champions.	"I really didn't change much approach-wise from first inning until the end of the game," Darvish said through a translator. "I just kept pitching the same way."	Making their third straight appearance in the NLCS, the weary Cubs also hurt themselves with a couple of big mistakes. Carl Edwards Jr. walked Darvish on four pitches with the bases loaded and two outs in the sixth, continuing a rocky postseason for the reliever and leading to a round of boos from a frustrated crowd of 41,871.	A passed ball brought home another run in the eighth, and pinch hitter Kyle Farmer hit a sacrifice fly to make it 6-1.	Darvish departed after striking out Addison Russell in the seventh, pausing for congratulations from his whole infield before heading to the dugout. The Japanese right-hander allowed six hits, including Schwarber's first-inning homer, in his second career playoff win -- both this year. He struck out seven and walked one.	Tony Watson got two outs, Brandon Morrow worked the eighth and Kenley Jansen closed it out after Ross Stripling gave up two hits in the ninth. With Roberts pushing the right buttons, Los Angeles' bullpen has yet to allow a run in the series.	"I think everybody's just been attacking," Morrow said. "That's the No. 1 thing."	The only four-game postseason sweep for the Dodgers came in the 1963 World Series against the New York Yankees. If Los Angeles can finish off Chicago on Wednesday, the Dodgers would have five days off before hosting the Yankees or Houston Astros in the World Series opener.	"We knew today was the most important game, and now tomorrow's the most important game," Ethier said. "We're going to come out and figure out how to get the job done again."	Schwarber's sixth career postseason homer got Chicago off to a fast start, but Jon Jay struck out with two on to end the inning. The Dodgers responded with Ethier's leadoff drive in the second and Taylor's second homer of the series in the third, a mammoth shot to center off losing pitcher Kyle Hendricks.	"We had a chance obviously, early," Maddon said. "We hit some balls well early in the game, and then he settled in."	Ethier had two hits in his first start of this year's playoffs after he missed most of the season with a herniated lumbar disk. Taylor also had two hits and is 4 for 14 for the series, helping make up for the loss of All-Star shortstop Corey Seager to a back injury.	ON THIS DAY	Tuesday was the 13th anniversary of Roberts' memorable stolen base for Boston in Game 4 of the 2004 ALCS against the New York Yankees. The Red Sox were three outs from elimination when Roberts ran for Kevin Millar, swiped second and scored on Bill Mueller's single.	Boston went on to rally past New York and sweep St. Louis for its first World Series championship since 1918. Roberts said he never mentions the steal to his players, but it comes up occasionally.	"Yu Darvish about two weeks ago I guess was surfing the internet, and there was an `aha' moment," Roberts said. "He ran across the stolen base and kind of put 2 and 2 together and didn't realize that was his manager. So he proceeded to kind of awkwardly approach me about it and talked about my goatee and how I could steal a base."	UP NEXT	Dodgers: Wood, who had a career-high 16 wins this season, will make his first appearance since Sept. 26. He was lined up for Game 4 of the NLDS, but the Dodgers swept the Diamondbacks in three games.	Cubs: Arrieta has pitched just 14 1/3 innings since Aug. 30, including four innings of two-hit ball against Washington in Game 4 of the NLDS. The 2015 NL Cy Young Award winner was hampered by a right hamstring injury at the end of the season.	---	Jay Cohen can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/jcohenap	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

NEW YORK --  This time, it was Masahiro Tanaka who was untouchable on the mound.	And when the New York Yankees sent Houston ace Dallas Keuchel to an early exit, their rollicking crowd let loose with a cathartic roar that must have boomed all over the Bronx.	"New York is no joke," Keuchel said afterward.	One more big win, and these Yankees are World Series-bound.	Tanaka pitched seven innings of three-hit ball and New York finally solved a longtime nemesis at just the right moment, beating Keuchel and the Astros 5-0 on Wednesday for a 3-2 lead in the AL Championship Series.	"What a performance," Yankees third baseman Todd Frazier said about Tanaka. "Just gutsy."	Gary Sanchez hit an RBI single off Keuchel and later homered to help the wild-card Yankees win for the third straight day at home, moving them within one victory of their first pennant since 2009 and record 41st overall.	The teams head back to Houston for Game 6 on Friday night, when Justin Verlander and the reeling Astros will try to regain their footing following an off day and force a decisive Game 7. Luis Severino is scheduled to start for New York.	To take the series, the Yankees knew they needed to win at least one game started by Keuchel or Verlander, both Cy Young Award winners. Now they've done that -- and they don't want to let Houston back up.	"Don't wake that sleeping dog. So we've got to just keep on rolling," Frazier said. "They're going to be ready to go. We know that."	Houston arrived up two games to none and appeared to be closing in on its second World Series appearance. But the Astros, like defending AL champion Cleveland before them, have been unable to put away these poised Yankees, who improved to 6-0 at home this postseason in front of their cheering, chanting fans.	New York has won 19 of its past 22 games at Yankee Stadium.	"It's been unbelievable. I haven't seen anything like it in Major League Baseball," veteran Chase Headley said. "Reminds me of college football games. They're going crazy the entire game. It's a huge advantage for us."	Aaron Judge, Greg Bird and Didi Gregorius also delivered big hits as New York chased Keuchel in the fifth and handed him his first postseason loss.	Keuchel had been Yankees kryptonite, entering 6-2 with a 1.09 ERA in eight career starts against New York -- including a pair of scoreless outings in playoff wins.	Both of those came at the expense of Tanaka, who lost 3-0 to Keuchel in the 2015 AL wild-card game at Yankee Stadium and 2-1 in Game 1 of this series. The ace lefty with the long, bushy beard entered 4-0 with a 1.69 ERA and 31 strikeouts in 26 2/3 postseason innings overall.	But this night belonged to Tanaka and the Baby Bombers.	New York finally broke through against Keuchel with two outs in the second, when Starlin Castro doubled and scored on Greg Bird's sharp single. The sellout crowd of 49,647 almost sounded surprised by the hit -- big enough for Bird to flash both thumbs down, doubling up on the Yankees' playful sign to each other for clutch swings.	"The most frustrating part is the fact that I didn't pick the guys up and they were looking towards me to kind of saddle up and get this thing back going again," Keuchel said. "That's a talented group over there and 1 through 9 right now the bats have woken up and it's quite a challenge."	In the third, Judge grounded an RBI double just inside the third base line and past a diving Alex Bregman. Brett Gardner sped all the way around from first and scored with a headfirst slide.	Bregman's throwing error on an infield single by Headley, who had three hits in the No. 9 spot, aided the Yankees in the fifth. Keuchel walked Judge with two outs before Sanchez lined a run-scoring single into the left-field corner.	Going into that at-bat, Sanchez was 1 for 16 with seven strikeouts in the series -- and 0 for 8 with six strikeouts against Keuchel overall.	Gregorius then grounded an RBI single up the middle that grazed the glove of diving second baseman Jose Altuve. That ended the night for Keuchel and gave the Yankees a 4-0 cushion, the most runs he had ever allowed against them.	With the stands pulsating, fans reveled in his slow walk to the dugout as the Yankee Stadium sound system blared Scandal's "Goodbye To You."	"When you play at home, things like this happen and that's why it's so tough to win on the road in the playoffs," Keuchel said. "Yankee Stadium is a tough place to play and it was rockin' these three games, but it's going to be rockin' on Friday for us."	Sanchez hit his third postseason homer off Brad Peacock in the seventh to make it 5-0.	Despite beautiful weather in the Bronx, the Astros didn't take batting practice on the field. If they were hoping that might help their slumping hitters reset, it didn't.	"One swing and we'll be back where we need to be," Bregman said. "We're going home. We've got to fight back."	The highest-scoring team in the majors this season, Houston is batting .147 in the series and Tanaka is a major reason. The normally reserved right-hander from Japan, who can opt out of his $155 million contract this winter, has been at the top of his game in October and showed rare emotion on the mound during this one.	He worked around a leadoff double in the second, when the Yankees -- with a stingy Keuchel undoubtedly in mind -- successfully played their infield in with Yuli Gurriel on third and one out in a scoreless game.	Tanaka later spun around and shouted in excitement after striking out struggling table-setters George Springer and Josh Reddick with two on to end the fifth.	"I love it. Those are the best guys. To see that, it gets me fired up again," Frazier said. "He's been doing it all postseason. Just dominant, man. You see him out there, he talks to himself, he does all this crazy stuff and the next thing you know the ball just disappears on batters."	Keeping the ball down with his slider and splitter, Tanaka struck out eight and walked one. Tommy Kahnle tossed two innings to finish the four-hitter.	Tanaka also beat the Indians 1-0 in the Division Series to save the Yankees' season when they were down 0-2 in that best-of-five playoff. After going 13-12 with a 4.74 ERA during an inconsistent season, he has a 0.90 ERA in three playoff starts.	"I feel like I'm just keeping it really simple," Tanaka said through a translator. "You go out there and you fight and you empty the tank."	MISTER OCTOBER	Wednesday marked the 40th anniversary of Reggie Jackson's three-homer game at old Yankee Stadium in the 1977 World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers.	COMING UP EMPTY	The lowest team batting average in league championship series history was .155 for Minnesota during a three-game sweep by Baltimore in 1969.	UP NEXT	Astros: Verlander is 8-0 in eight outings for Houston since agreeing to a trade from Detroit, just minutes before the Aug. 31 deadline for postseason eligibility. The 2011 AL MVP is 3-0 with a 2.04 ERA in these playoffs, including a series-clinching victory in relief during the Division Series against Boston and his five-hitter with 13 strikeouts to beat the Yankees on a season-high 124 pitches in Game 2. The right-hander is 10-5 with a 3.18 ERA in his postseason career.	Yankees: Severino gave up one run and two hits over four innings in Game 2 but was pulled as a precaution after only 62 pitches because manager Joe Girardi was concerned about the 23-year-old righty pitching hurt, saying he didn't look comfortable in his mechanics. By now, the Yankees are confident he's fine.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

Joe Maddon didn't agree with the "process" the umpires went through that caused them to change a strike three call on Curtis Granderson to a foul tip. (0:49)	CHICAGO --  Javier Baez sensed he was ready to bust out of his slump and give the Chicago Cubs the lift they needed.	As breakthroughs go, this was a big one. Just in time to keep the season going for the defending champs.	Baez snapped an 0-for-20 skid with two home runs, Wade Davis hung on for a six-out save and Cubs avoided a sweep, holding off the Los Angeles Dodgers 3-2 Wednesday night in Game 4 of the NL Championship Series.	"We have to be much more offensive," manager Joe Maddon said. "It's got to start happening tomorrow. We're going to do this. Going to pull this off, we have to become more offensive tomorrow."	Baez finally got going with a pair of solo drives .	Jake Arrieta pitched three-hit ball into the seventh inning to help the Cubs close their deficit to 3-1. Maddon got ejected for the second time in this series in the eighth, and a packed Wrigley Field crowd watched Davis get Cody Bellinger to ground into a game-ending double play.	Maddon was heavily criticized for not using Davis during a 4-1 loss in Game 2. This time, the Cubs closer threw 48 pitches to finish the job.	Willson Contreras also homered for the Cubs. Bellinger and Justin Turner connected for the Dodgers, who had won a team-record six straight playoff games.	Game 5 is Thursday, with Jose Quintana pitching for Chicago against Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw.	"They're the world champs, and you know they're going to fight to the end," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. "So today, they did. We got beat today."	Baez hit solo drives in the second and fifth after going hitless in his first 20 playoff at-bats. He had been watching videos and felt his timing was starting to come back in recent trips to the plate.	"I just need to take a step back and see what's going on," he said.	Contreras added a long homer against Alex Wood.	Davis entered with a 3-1 lead in the eighth. He gave up a leadoff homer to Turner, who went 2 for 2 and drew two walks.	Maddon became incensed that a swinging strike three against Curtis Granderson was ruled a foul after the umpires discussed the play. Maddon got tossed, and Granderson struck out swinging at the next pitch.	And after walking Yasmani Grandal to put runners on first and second, Davis struck out Chase Utley , who is hitless in his last 24 postseason at-bats.	All seven of Chicago's runs in this series have come on homers. And long drives in the second by Contreras and Baez made it 2-0.	"Great to have this win, because if not we were going home tomorrow," Baez said. "But I feel like we're still not on track as a team. But I think if we get back on track, everybody as a team, we're going to be the best again."	Contreras' 491-foot homer banged off the left-field videoboard and Baez sent a towering drive out to left.	Bellinger cut it to 2-1 with his drive to right in the third. But Baez got the lead back up to two with a shot to the left-field bleachers in the fifth, the raucous crowd chanting "Javy! Javy!" for the flashy young star who was co-MVP of the NLCS last year.	No Cubs player had hit two in a playoff game since Alex Gonzalez went deep twice in Game 2 of the 2003 NLCS against Miami.	Arrieta exited with runners on first and second in the seventh after walking Chris Taylor on a 3-2 pitch. He tipped his hat as fans gave him a standing ovation, a fitting show of appreciation for a pitcher with an expiring contract.	"Hopefully, it's not a goodbye, it's a thank you, obviously," Arrieta said. "I still intend to have another start in this ballpark. If that's where it ends, I did my best and I left it all out there."	Arrieta turns 32 in March and figures to land a huge deal in free agency. The trade that brought him from Baltimore helped fuel Chicago's rise, with the right-hander capturing the 2015 NL Cy Young Award and contributing to last year's drought-busting championship run.	Limited by a right hamstring injury in the final month of the season, he threw 111 pitches. Brian Duensing retired Bellinger on a fly to end the seventh.	Turner made it a one-run game with his homer off the left-field videoboard against Davis in the eighth.	A career-high 16-game winner, Wood gave up three runs and four hits in 42/3 innings.	"The only frustrating thing is we fell a run short," Turner said. "We played a great game, they played a great game. They just hit one more ball over the fence than we did."	FINISHING UP	Maddon said Davis would not be available on Thursday.	"So other guys got to do it," Maddon said. "We have to be much more offensive. It's got to start happening tomorrow. We're going to do this. Going to pull this off, we have to become more offensive tomorrow."	QUOTABLE	Chicago's Kyle Schwarber on all the Cubs' runs coming on homers in the series: "That's fine. A run's a run, anyway you can get them in. Obviously, we want to manufacture some runs, but we won a ballgame 3-2 hitting homers; I'll take that, too."	UP NEXT	Dodgers: The Dodgers turn to Kershaw to try to wrap up the series. The three-time NL Cy Young winner went five innings in Game 1, allowing two runs, and has a 4.76 ERA in two postseason starts this year.	Cubs: Quintana pitched five innings of two-hit ball in Game 1, one day after his wife, Michel, was taken off the team plane in Albuquerque with a medical ailment.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

CHICAGO --  Enrique Hernandez put a Hollywood ending on an LA story three decades in the making.	Fueled by a home run trilogy from their emotional utilityman, Clayton Kershaw and the Los Angeles Dodgers are finally going to the World Series.	Hernandez homered three times and drove in a record seven runs, Kershaw breezed through six crisp innings and Los Angeles ended the Chicago Cubs' title defense with an 11-1 rout in Game 5 of the NL Championship Series on Thursday night.	"It feels good to hear World Series," Kershaw said. "It's been a long time coming for this team."	After years of playoff heartache, there was just no stopping these Dodgers after they led the majors with 104 wins during the regular season. With Kershaw firing away at the top of a deep pitching staff and co-NLCS MVPs Justin Turner and Chris Taylor leading a tough lineup, one of baseball's most storied franchises captured its first pennant since Hall of Famer Tommy Lasorda managed Kirk Gibson, Orel Hershiser and Co. to Los Angeles' last championship in 1988.	"Every night it is a different guy," Turner said, "and this is one of the most unbelievable teams I've ever been a part of."	Kershaw will be on the mound again when the Dodgers host the New York Yankees or Houston Astros in Game 1 of the World Series on Tuesday night. The Yankees have a 3-2 lead heading into Game 6 of the ALCS at Houston on Friday night, so one more New York win would set up another chapter in an old October rivalry between the Yankees and Dodgers.	Los Angeles made the playoffs eight times in the previous 13 seasons and came up short of its 22nd pennant each time, often with Kershaw shouldering much of the blame. The three-time NL Cy Young Award winner took the loss when his team was eliminated by the Cubs in Game 6 of last year's NLCS at Wrigley Field.	The ace left-hander was just OK during his first two starts in this year's postseason, but Los Angeles' offense picked him up each time. Backed by Hernandez's powerful show in Chicago, Kershaw turned in an efficient three-hit performance with five strikeouts and improved to 6-7 in the playoffs -- matching Burt Hooton's club record for postseason wins.	"To get to be on the mound tonight and get to be going to the World Series on the same night, it's a special thing," Kershaw said. "Who knows how many times I'm going to get to go to the World Series? I know more than anybody how hard it is to get there. So, I'm definitely not taking this one for granted."	When Kenley Jansen retired Willson Contreras on a liner to shortstop for the final out, the party was on . The Dodgers poured out of the dugout and mobbed their dominant closer near the mound, and a small but vocal group of Los Angeles fans gathered behind the visitors' dugout and chanted "Let's go Dodgers! Let's go Dodgers!"	On the field, manager Dave Roberts hugged Lasorda and told the iconic skipper the win was for him.	"I bleed Dodger blue just like you," Roberts said. "Thank you, Tommy."	Hernandez connected on the first two pitches he saw, belting a solo drive in the second for his first career playoff homer and then a grand slam in the third against Hector Rondon. Hernandez added a two-run shot in the ninth against Mike Montgomery.	The 26-year-old Hernandez became the fourth player with a three-homer game in a league championship series, joining Bob Robertson (1971 NLCS), George Brett (1978 ALCS) and Adam Kennedy (2002 ALCS). Hernandez's seven RBI tied a postseason record shared by four other players who all did it in a Division Series.	Troy O'Leary was the previous player to have seven RBI in a playoff game, for Boston at Cleveland in the 1999 ALDS.	It was a stunning display for a player with 28 career homers who remains concerned about his native Puerto Rico, which is recovering from a devastating hurricane. He delivered a historic performance in front of his father, Enrique Hernandez Sr., who was diagnosed with a blood cancer related to leukemia in December 2015, but got word last November that he was in remission.	"For me to be able to come here and do something like this is pretty special," said Hernandez, who also goes by Kik�. "My body's here, but my mind's kind of back home. It's hard being away from home with what's going on.	"All I want to do right now is go to my dad and give him a big hug."	Kris Bryant homered for Chicago, but the NL Central champions finished with just four hits in another tough night at the plate. Each of their eight runs in the NLCS came via the long ball, and they batted just .156 for the series with 53 strikeouts.	Long playoff runs in each of the last two years and a grueling five-game Division Series against Washington seemed to sap Chicago of some energy, and its pitching faltered against sweet-swinging Los Angeles. Jose Quintana was pulled in the third inning of the final game, and the Cubs never recovered.	"They executed their plan," Bryant said. "They pitched great and the bullpen was lights out. That makes for a tough time scoring runs."	Turner and Taylor helped put it away for Los Angeles, contributing to a 16-hit outburst while closing out a pair of impressive performances.	Turner singled home Taylor in the Dodgers' five-run third, giving him seven RBI in the series and 24 throughout his postseason career. Taylor finished with two hits and scored two runs as the Dodgers, who have won five straight NL West titles, improved to 7-1 in this postseason.	Taylor's versatility helped Los Angeles cover for the loss of All-Star shortstop Corey Seager, who missed the series with a back injury, but is expected to return in the next round. Coming off a breakout season, the 27-year-old Taylor hit .316 with two homers and scored five times against the Cubs.	"I couldn't be happier to be a part of this and be with these guys," Taylor said. "It's been an unbelievable year, and I'm just super excited."	OUT WITH A BANG	Hernandez joined Kennedy (2002), Adrian Beltre (2011), Reggie Jackson (1977 vs. the Dodgers) and Babe Ruth (1928) as players to hit three home runs in a postseason series clincher.	LIGHTS OUT	Dodgers relievers have thrown 23 consecutive scoreless innings, a postseason record.	---	Jay Cohen can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/jcohenap	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

HOUSTON --  Justin Verlander remained perfect with the Houston Astros when they couldn't afford anything else.	The ace right-hander pitched seven shutout innings and Jose Altuve homered and drove in three runs during a 7-1 victory over the New York Yankees on Friday night that extended the AL Championship Series to a decisive Game 7.	"He's been everything that we could have hoped for and more," Astros manager A.J. Hinch said about Verlander. "He chose to come here for games like this and beyond."	Acquired in an Aug. 31 trade, Verlander has won all nine of his outings for the Astros -- including three starts and his first career relief appearance during the postseason. With his new club facing playoff elimination for the first time in Game 6 against the Yankees, he delivered again to tie the series 3-all.	"There's no point in saving anything," Verlander said, acknowledging the last two innings took a lot out of him.	Game 7 is Saturday night in Houston, with the winner advancing to the World Series against the NL champion Los Angeles Dodgers.	"It's going to be a crazy night," Altuve said. "I know both teams are going to go out there and leave everything they have."	CC Sabathia is scheduled to start for New York against Charlie Morton in a rematch of Game 3, won 8-1 by the Yankees. The home team has taken every game in the series.	"We've been in this situation throughout the year," New York rookie slugger Aaron Judge said. "We've gone down in series. We've gone down in games. We've always fought back. That's what we're going to continue to do."	George Springer helped the 34-year-old Verlander out of a jam in the seventh, leaping to make a catch at the center-field wall that robbed Todd Frazier of extra bases with two on and the Astros up 3-0.	"I thought homer," Verlander said. "That was obviously one of the big turning moments in the game."	When it was over, Verlander had improved to 4-1 with a 1.21 ERA in five career postseason elimination games. He ran his scoreless streak in such games to 24 innings.	"We hope we all get to see him pitch again," Hinch said.	After striking out 13 for a complete-game victory in Game 2, Verlander threw another gem. The 2011 AL MVP and Cy Young Award winner scattered five hits and struck out eight to improve to 9-0 with a 1.23 ERA and 67 strikeouts since agreeing to a trade from Detroit that was completed only seconds before the midnight deadline for postseason eligibility.	For the Astros, it was Just-in time.	"I literally love Justin Verlander," Altuve said. "The way he goes out there makes me feel like I have to go out there and play the same way he's doing it."	Brian McCann's RBI ground-rule double in the fifth ended an 0-for-20 slump before Altuve snapped an 0-for-12 skid with a two-run single later in the inning.	Altuve hit his fourth homer of the postseason when he connected on a solo shot off David Robertson in the eighth.	"I love the way we played today," Altuve said.	Houston improved to 5-0 at home this postseason after dropping three straight in New York as the Astros chase their second trip to the World Series (2005). Saturday will be just their second Game 7 in franchise history after losing the final game of the 2004 NLCS at St. Louis 5-2.	The last Game 7 for the Yankees also was a loss in 2004, when they capped an unprecedented collapse against rival Boston after leading 3-0 in the ALCS.	This year, the Yankees are 4-0 in postseason elimination games as they try to reach the World Series for the first time since 2009. New York is 1-5 on the road in these playoffs, however.	"I think you have to keep tonight's game in perspective," manager Joe Girardi said. "We still have a shot to do what we want to try to do tomorrow. And put tonight behind you, move on, and let's be ready to go tomorrow."	Judge cut the lead to 3-1 with a homer off Brad Peacock in the eighth. But that came after Judge struck out in two of his first three at-bats to give him 26 strikeouts this postseason, tying him with Alfonso Soriano for the most in one postseason.	Peacock settled down after the homer by Judge, retiring the next two batters, capped by a strikeout of Gary Sanchez to end the inning. Ken Giles finished it off with a scoreless ninth.	Houston led the majors in scoring during the regular season but had struggled in this series, managing just nine runs in the first five games. Alex Bregman, who changed his walk-up music to Tom Petty's "I Won't Back Down" on Friday, belted a two-run double in the eighth to make it 6-1, giving the Astros more runs than they'd managed in their last three games.	Bregman grinned when asked if that song was the attitude of his team on Friday.	"Yeah," he said. "We're not backing down."	Verlander knew Houston's powerful offense would get going sooner or later. He's just glad it happened before it was too late.	"There was no question these guys were going to break out, it was just a matter of time," he said. "Thankfully that wasn't next year."	Many in the rowdy crowd of 43,179, which included Roger Clemens and former Rockets great Clyde Drexler, held signs and most fans waved orange towels that were handed out at the door. One woman hoisted a sign that read: "Verlander (equals) Victory" and a little boy clutched one that said: "Justin Time" above a crudely drawn clock.	After the Astros got walloped in three games in the Bronx, New York starter Luis Severino kept them off balance early and they didn't get a hit until a single by Carlos Correa with two outs in the fourth. Bregman walked to start Houston's fifth before a one-out walk to Evan Gattis. McCann got his first hit of the series with his ground-rule double that made it 1-0 after Houston had gone 15 straight innings without scoring.	Severino walked Springer to load the bases before retiring Josh Reddick. Altuve then sent the first pitch of his at-bat sailing just inches over the glove of Frazier at third base and into left field to make it 3-0 and chase Severino.	Altuve raised his arms and implored the crowd to get louder as he reached first base, finally breaking out of a rare slump with his first hit since Game 2 of this series. The major league batting champion had failed to get a hit in three straight games just one other time this season. Altuve is 15 for 37 with seven RBI and six multi-hit games this postseason.	Verlander walked Greg Bird to start the seventh before plunking Starlin Castro on a pitch that Girardi asked to be reviewed. Aaron Hicks fought through a 10-pitch at-bat before striking out. Springer's catch came next, and Frazier waved his hand in disgust as a jubilant Verlander pumped both arms skyward.	"He hit the ball well and I knew I had to go get it," Springer said. "I was just able to get to the spot."	When he got out of the inning by inducing a groundout from Chase Headley, Verlander pounded his glove and screamed.	Severino yielded three hits and three runs while walking four in 4 2/3 innings during his fourth playoff start.	UP NEXT	Yankees: Sabathia allowed three hits over six shutout innings for the first scoreless start of his postseason career in Game 3 at Yankee Stadium. He is 10-0 this season following a Yankees loss, including the playoffs.	Astros: Morton was picked to start Game 7 over Peacock and Lance McCullers Jr., who threw well in his Game 4 start but would be working on only three days' rest. Morton was unlucky in his Game 3 outing, when he gave up several soft hits and a three-run homer by Frazier to the opposite field. The right-hander was charged with seven runs and six hits in 3 2/3 innings.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

Charlie Morton and Lance McCullers Jr. combined on a three-hitter, Altuve and Evan Gattis homered and the Astros reached the World Series for only the second time by blanking the New York Yankees 4-0 Saturday night in Game 7 of the AL Championship Series.	Next up for the Astros: Game 1 against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Tuesday night. Los Angeles opened as a narrow favorite, but Verlander, the ALCS MVP , and fellow Houston ace Dallas Keuchel will have plenty of rest before the World Series begins at sweltering Dodger Stadium.	"I love our personality," Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. "We have the right amount of fun, the right amount of seriousness, the right amount of perspective when we need it. This is a very, very unique group. To win 100 games and still be hungry is pretty remarkable."	The Astros will try for their first World Series title, thanks in large part to Altuve , the diminutive second baseman who swings a potent bat, and Verlander, who switched teams for the first time in his career to chase a ring.	Four years removed from their third straight 100-loss season in 2013, the Astros shut down the Yankees on consecutive nights after dropping three in a row in the Bronx.	The only previous time the Astros made it this far, they were a National League team when they were swept by the Chicago White Sox in 2005.	Hinch's club has a chance to win that elusive first crown, while trying to boost a region still recovering from Hurricane Harvey.	"This city, they deserve this," McCullers said.	Clutch defensive plays by third baseman Alex Bregman and center fielder George Springer helped Houston improve to 6-0 at Minute Maid Park in these playoffs and become the fifth team in major league history to capture a seven-game postseason series by winning all four of its home games.	Morton bounced back from a loss in Game 3 to allow two hits over five scoreless innings. Starter-turned-postseason reliever McCullers limited the Yankees to just one hit while fanning six over the next four. A noted curveballer, McCullers finished up with 24 straight breaking pitches to earn his first major league save.	Combined, they throttled the wild-card Yankees one last time in Houston. Aaron Judge, Gary Sanchez and their New York teammates totaled just three runs in the four road games.	"I know people are going to talk about how we didn't win many games on the road. There were some other teams that haven't won many games on the road, either. We just happened to run into a very good team that just beat us," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.	The Astros also eliminated New York in the 2015 postseason, with Keuchel winning the AL wild-card game at Yankee Stadium.	CC Sabathia entered 10-0 with a 1.69 ERA in 13 starts this season after a Yankees loss. But he struggled with command and was gone with one out in the fourth inning.	Houston was up 2-0 in fifth when former Yankees star Brian McCann came through for the second straight game by hitting a two-run double. He snapped an 0-for-20 skid with an RBI double to give Houston its first run on Friday night in a 7-1 win.	The Yankees, trying to reach the World Series for the first time since 2009, lost an elimination game for the first time this season after winning their first four in these playoffs. New York went 1-6 on the road this postseason.	After going 0 for 5 with runners in scoring position through the first three innings, the Astros got on the board with no outs in the fourth with the 405-foot shot by Gattis.	Altuve launched a ball off Tommy Kahnle into the seats in right field with one out in the fifth for his fifth homer this postseason. It took a while for him to see that it was going to get out, and held onto his bat until he was halfway to first base before flipping it and trotting around the bases as chants of "MVP" rained down on him.	Altuve finished 8 for 25 with two homers and four RBI in the ALCS after hitting .533 with three homers and four RBI in the ALDS against Boston.	Carlos Correa and Yuli Gurriel hit consecutive singles before Kahnle struck out Gattis. McCann's two-strike double, which rolled into the corner of right field, cleared the bases to push the lead to 4-0. Gurriel slid to avoid the tag and remained on his belly in a swimming pose at the plate for a few seconds after he was called safe.	It was just the second Game 7 in franchise history for the Astros, who lost to the Cardinals in the 2004 NLCS exactly 13 years earlier.	Sabathia allowed five hits and one run while walking three in 3 1/3 innings. He wasn't nearly as sharp as he was in a Game 3 win and just 36 of the 65 pitches he threw were strikes.	Morton got into trouble in the fifth, and the Yankees had runners at the corners with one out. Bregman fielded a grounder hit by Todd Frazier and made a perfect throw home to allow McCann to tag Greg Bird and preserve Houston's lead. McCann held onto the ball despite Bird's cleat banging into his forearm. Chase Headley grounded out after that to end the inning.	A night after Springer kept Frazier from extra-bases with a leaping catch, Judge returned the favor on a ball hit by Yuli Gurriel. Judge sprinted, jumped and reached into the stands to grab his long fly ball before crashing into the wall and falling to the ground for the first out of the second inning.	Springer had another nifty catch in this one, jumping in front of Marwin Gonzalez at the wall in left-center to grab a ball hit by Bird for the first out of the seventh.	With McCullers in charge, the Astros soon closed it out.	"It's not easy to get here. And I don't take any of this for granted. And this is what we play for," Verlander said. "These are the experiences that you remember at the end of your career when you look back, winning these games, just playing the World Series. Hopefully winning the World Series."	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

LOS ANGELES -- No sweat, Clayton Kershaw.	Changing jerseys to beat the 103-degree heat, the Dodgers ace with a checkered playoff history delivered a signature performance, pitching Los Angeles past the Houston Astros 3-1 Tuesday night in the World Series opener.	Boosted by Justin Turner's tiebreaking, two-run homer in the sixth inning off Dallas Keuchel, Kershaw was in complete control against the highest-scoring team in the majors this season.	"I felt good. It's a tough lineup over there," Kershaw said. "The way Keuchel was throwing it was up and down a lot, which was good. It got us into a rhythm a little bit. I think for me personally, it helped out a lot."	The left-hander had waited his whole career for this moment. And once he took the mound in his Series debut, he lived up every bit to the legacy of Sandy Koufax, Orel Hershiser and the greatest of Dodgers hurlers.	The three-time Cy Young Award winner struck out 11, gave up just three hits and walked none over seven innings, featuring a sharp breaking ball that often left Houston batters looking foolish. His lone blemish was a home run by Alex Bregman in the fourth that made it 1-all.	Brandon Morrow worked a perfect eighth and Kenley Jansen breezed through the Astros in the ninth for a save in a combined three-hitter. The Dodgers' dominant relievers have thrown 25 straight scoreless innings this postseason.	With both aces throwing well, the opener zipped by in 2 hours, 28 minutes -- fastest in the World Series since Game 4 in 1992 between Toronto and Atlanta. Jimmy Key and the Blue Jays won that one 2-1 in 2:21.	And it certainly was unusual for this postseason, with games averaging 3 hours, 32 minutes -- up 18 minutes from two years ago.	A pulsating crowd that came to see the Dodgers' first Series game since 1988 enjoyed an immediate jolt when Chris Taylor hit a no-doubt home run on Keuchel's very first pitch. Taylor was the co-MVP of the NL Championship Series with Turner, and they both kept swinging away against the Astros.	The loss left the Astros still without a single World Series win in their 56-season history. In their only other Series appearance, they were swept by the White Sox in 2005.	Game 2 is Wednesday night, with AL Championship Series MVP Justin Verlander starting against Dodgers lefty Rich Hill.	Kershaw has almost every imaginable individual accolade on his resume -- five ERA titles, an MVP trophy, a no-hitter and seven All-Star selections -- but also was dogged by a shaky October past.	He began this outing in the twilight with a 6-7 career playoff record and an unsightly 4.40 ERA. He improved to 3-0 in four starts this postseason.	A Series opener that served as a showcase for several of the game's best young hitters -- Jose Altuve, Carlos Correa, Cody Bellinger and more -- instead was dominated by Kershaw.	Facing a team that had the fewest strikeouts in the majors this year, Kershaw fanned more Houston hitters than any starter this season.	The Dodgers, who led the majors with 104 wins and a $240 million payroll, watched Kershaw put them ahead in this best-of-seven series.	It was 1-all when Taylor drew a two-out walk in the sixth. Turner followed with his drive off the bearded Keuchel.	While it was sweltering, the conditions didn't seem to affect either side.	There is no reliable record for the hottest temperature at a World Series game. But weather data indicates this might've been the steamiest ever.	Notorious for late arrivals, Dodger fans showed up early and the seats in the shaded sections filled up fast. Keeping with the theme, the stadium organist played 1960s hits "Heat Wave" and "Summer in the City" as Houston warmed up.	When Vin Scully's familiar recorded call of "It's Time for Dodger Baseball" boomed over the PA system, the crowd really let loose, with the entire ballpark standing and chanting for the pregame introductions.	Scully drew a huge ovation when he was later shown on the video board, sitting in a box. Several players clapped along for the Hall of Fame broadcaster, who's nearly 90 and spent 67 seasons calling Dodgers games.	Dustin Hoffman, Jerry Seinfeld and Lady Gaga were among the many celebs in the sellout crowd of 54,253, along Dodgers great Tom Lasorda and part-owner Magic Johnson.	In every way, it sure was different than the last time Houston visited Dodger Stadium. That was 2012, when the Astros were in the NL Central, were stuck in the middle of three straight 100-loss seasons and Correa was a high schooler.	For a long time, these teams were familiar rivals, playing more than 700 times before the Astros switched to the American League. They also share a significant date -- Dodger Stadium opened on April 10, 1962, when L.A. lost to Cincinnati. The very same day, Houston played its first game when the expansion Colt .45s beat the Cubs.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

LOS ANGELES --  George Springer screamed with joy as he circled the bases after hitting a two-run homer in the 11th inning.	Would it be enough? Was this the final plot twist on one of the wildest nights in postseason history?	Yes, it was -- barely -- and the Houston Astros won a World Series game for the first time in their 56 seasons.	Charlie Culberson hit a two-out homer in the bottom half off Chris Devenski, who then struck out Yasiel Puig in a tense, nine-pitch at-bat for the win. The Astros outlasted the Los Angeles Dodgers 7-6 in a Hollywood thriller Wednesday to tie the Series at one game apiece.	"Wasn't that the best game ever!?" Alex Bregman proclaimed to no one in particular in the Astros clubhouse.	On a night of dramatic swings and a World Series-record eight home runs, Marwin Gonzalez stunned the Dodger Stadium crowd with a solo shot off dominant Los Angeles closer Kenley Jansen on an 0-2 pitch in the ninth that made it 3-all.	Jose Altuve and Carlos Correa hit consecutive home runs against Josh Fields in the 10th to build a 5-3 Astros lead, with Correa flipping his bat to celebrate.	But there was more. Much, much more.	"This is an instant classic and to be part of it is pretty special," Astros starter Justin Verlander said.	Puig homered off Ken Giles starting the bottom of the 10th and Enrique Hernandez knotted the score 5-5 with a two-out RBI single .	Devenski entered and, with Hernandez at second, made a wild pickoff throw that appeared headed toward left-center field before it struck second base umpire Laz Diaz. An incredulous Hernandez put both hands on his helmet, unable to advance, and was stranded when Chris Taylor flied out.	"We were pretty unlucky at the beginning of the game when Taylor dove in center field and (the ball) hit him in the face or head," Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. "I felt like the baseball gods were returning the favor, by having an umpire standing in the way there."	Cameron Maybin, who had entered in the 10th, singled leading off the 11th against losing pitcher Brandon McCarthy, a surprise addition to the Dodgers' World Series roster who was pitching for the first time since Oct. 1. Maybin stole second and Springer hit a drive to right-center for a 7-5 lead, just the third 11th-inning home run in the Series after shots by Kirby Puckett in 1991 and David Freese in 2011.	Springer, an All-Star leadoff man, broke out of his slump with three hits and a walk after going 0 for 4 with four strikeouts in the Series opener Tuesday. His decisive drive made the Astros the first team to hit three extra-inning home runs in a postseason game.	Devenski retired Corey Seager and Justin Turner on lineouts in the bottom half. Puig checked his swing on a 2-2 pitch -- the Astros jumped when first base umpire Gerry Davis signaled no swing -- and Puig fouled off two more. Devenski threw his fifth straight changeup, and Puig swung over it as the Astros ran onto the field to celebrate after finally closing out a back-and-forth game that lasted 4 hours, 19 minutes.	"It was an emotional roller coaster," said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, who removed starter Rich Hill after he threw only 60 pitches in four solid innings and struck out seven.	After another steamy night in a Santa Ana heat wave, the series shifts to Texas and resumes Friday night at Houston's Minute Maid Park, where the retractable roof has not been open for a game since June 9. Lance McCullers Jr. starts for the Astros and Yu Darvish for the Dodgers, who acquired him from Texas at the July 31 trade deadline.	Houston is 2-5 on the road in the postseason but 6-0 at home, where the Astros have outscored the Red Sox and Yankees by a combined 31-7.	"We didn't expect these guys to lay down. It's a very good ballclub over there," Roberts said. "We'll be ready to go."	Before Gonzalez's home run, the Dodgers had an 85 percent chance of winning, according to Fangraphs. After Correa's long ball, the Astros were a 93 percent favorite.	Verlander, wearing an undershirt, entered the dugout at one point and screamed at his teammates that the game was not over.	"All of a sudden, two runs seemed like it was the Grand Canyon," he said. "I was just trying to remind these guys two runs is nothing."	Bregman's RBI single in the third gave Houston its first lead of the Series, a hit that might have turned into a three-run, inside-the-park homer had the ball not caromed off the bill of Taylor's cap directly to left fielder Joc Pederson.	Los Angeles had just two hits through seven innings but led 3-1 behind Pederson's fifth-inning solo homer and Seager's tiebreaking, two-run drive in the sixth against Verlander. It was Pederson's first home run since July 26.	Jansen entered with a 3-1 lead trying for his first six-out save in a year after Bregman doubled leading off the eighth against Brandon Morrow, a ball that ticked off the glove of a diving Puig in the right-field corner. Furious that he didn't make what would have been a sensational catch, Puig slammed his mitt to the ground.	Correa's RBI single off Jansen ended a record 28-inning postseason scoreless streak by the Dodgers' bullpen.	Gonzalez, choking up on the bat, seemed an unlikely candidate for a tying homer. He had not driven in a run in his 45 plate appearances since Houston's playoff opener, and the blown save was just the second for Jansen this year. The Dodgers had been 98-0 in 2017 when leading after eight innings, including the postseason.	"I didn't make my pitch," Jansen said. "You can't beat yourself up about that."	As the slanting sun illuminated the green hills of Elysian Park behind center field and the ochre-tinted San Gabriel Mountains beyond, retired Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully took the mound for the ceremonial first pitch . The 89-year-old, who left the booth in 2016 after his 67th season, charmed the crowd when he began "somewhere up in heaven, Duke Snider, Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella and Gil Hodges are laughing their heads off" at his presence on the mound. He feigned an arm injury and turned the ritual over to Fernando Valenzuela, who helped the Dodgers win their 1981 title.	The game-time temperature was 93 degrees -- down 10 degrees from the opener. Celebrities in the sellout crowd of 54,293 included golfers Tiger Woods and Fred Couples, and former NFL quarterback Peyton Manning.	Houston improved to 10-0 in nine starts and one relief appearance by Verlander, the 2011 AL MVP and Cy Young Award winner obtained in a trade from Detroit at the Aug. 31 deadline to be eligible for the Astros' postseason roster.	Afterward, players were exhausted.	"When that last out is made, you finally breathe," Springer said. "That's an emotional high -- emotional high to low to high again. But that's why we play the game. And that's the craziest game that I've ever played in. And it's only Game 2."	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

Brad Peacock is thrilled that his first MLB save came in the World Series and how he handled the Dodgers' lefties. (1:01)	HOUSTON --  A perfect fit in their own place, the Houston Astros are halfway home.	George Springer and the Astros broke out the bats early this time to keep up their unbeaten October run at spirited Minute Maid Park, beating the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-3 Friday night for a 2-1 lead in the World Series.	"We're very comfortable here," Astros manager A.J. Hinch said.	You can say that again.	Houston moved two wins from its first championship, but the game also included this: Yuli Gurriel made a racist gesture shortly after homering off Japanese star Yu Darvish. Major League Baseball will follow up, and punishment is possible.	The ballpark was booming hours earlier, with cheers, chants and a train whistle echoing beneath the closed roof.	Deep in the heart of football country, a sellout crowd stood much of the evening. And with every Houston batter getting a hit or walk, fans enjoyed the Friday Night Sights.	"The energy in the building is second to none," Hinch said. "It's loud. They're loud from the very beginning."	Coming off a dramatic rally to win Game 2 at Dodger Stadium, the Astros improved to 7-0 at home this postseason. Jose Altuve & Co. have dominated, too, outscoring the Red Sox, Yankees and Dodgers 36-10 in that span.	Gurriel homered to begin a four-run burst in the second inning that sent Darvish to the shortest start of his career.	Back in the dugout, Gurriel put his fingers to the side of his eyes and said "chinito" -- a derogatory Spanish term that translates literally to "little Chinese." Gurriel, from Cuba, previously played in Japan.	"I feel bad and I apologize for anybody who got offended," Gurriel said through a translator.	Darvish, through a translator, said, "Acting like that, you just disrespect all the people around the world."	Astros curveballer Lance McCullers Jr. wobbled, but protected the lead into the sixth.Brad Peacock rose to the occasion with 3 2/3 innings of hitless relief for his first pro save.	With every pitch by Peacock in the ninth, the decibel level increased.	"To tell you the truth, when I was out there a couple of times, I got the chills from them screaming so loud," he said.	Springer lined a leadoff double in the first and the Astros went on to win a home game for the first time in the World Series. They were swept by the White Sox in 2005, and this win left them two victories from a most elusive championship.	Game 4 will be Saturday night when Charlie Morton starts for Houston. Left-hander Alex Wood pitches for the Dodgers, facing a lineup that has put at least one runner on in 14 straight innings.	"Obviously, this crowd is into it. Very educated, very enthusiastic," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. "They've got some confidence over there, that team."	McCullers left in the sixth as Los Angeles scored twice to cut into a 5-1 deficit.	Peacock followed, and shouldered the load for a shaky bullpen. The right-hander was nearly perfect, walking one and striking out four.	"It was awesome," said Peacock, who made 21 starts and 13 relief appearances during the regular season. "I've never experienced anything like that in my life."	Coupled with four shutout innings from McCullers to finish off the Yankees in Game 7 of the AL Championship Series, the unconventional Astros became the first team to have two saves of three-plus innings in one postseason.	On a night when a lot went right for Houston, also credit third base coach Gary Pettis, who's been having quite a postseason. He boldly sent Josh Reddick careening home on a wild throw by reliever Tony Watson for a two-out run in the fifth.	The Astros rode the momentum of a thrilling victory Wednesday night in Los Angeles, where Marwin Gonzalez hit a tying homer in the ninth on an 0-2 pitch from star closer Kenley Jansen, and Houston went deep three times in extra innings before hanging on to win 7-6 in 11 on Springer's two-run shot.	Dodgers rookie Cody Bellinger almost won that game with a drive that was caught on the warning track in the ninth. He fanned all four times up in Game 3, leaving him 0 for 11 with seven strikeouts in the Series.	"I think he's just in that funk right now where he's chasing balls out of the strike zone," Roberts said.	This game wasn't nearly as dramatic as the previous one, not that the home crowd minded.	Fans were revved up from the start when injured Houston Texas defensive end J.J. Watt -- who has raised more than $37 million for relief efforts after Hurricane Harvey -- hobbled out to the mound on crutches to throw the first ball.	Soon, it was time for the Houston hitters to take over.	Gurriel homered into the Crawford Boxes in left to begin the second -- he became the 12th hitter already to homer in this Series. Reddick followed with a double and Evan Gattis, the designated hitter with the game in an American League park, drew a walk.	Gonzalez launched a drive off the wall in left-center and wound up with an RBI single when Gattis held at second , seeing if the ball would be caught. Brian McCann singled home another run with one of his three hits , and Alex Bregman's sacrifice fly made it 4-0.	When Altuve doubled, Darvish was done after 1 2/3 innings. He threw 49 pitches and the Astros swung and missed only once.	Darvish had done well at Minute Maid, going 4-1. That included a 2013 start when he was one out from a perfect game for the Rangers before Gonzalez singled.	"The fastball command wasn't there, and the slider was backing up. So he just really didn't have the feel and couldn't get any type of rhythm going," Roberts said.	Last month, Darvish and several Dodgers players wore Houston Strong T-shirts to raise money for hurricane relief. The four-time All-Star who previously played in Texas also contributed to the relief efforts.	On Thursday, Darvish kidded that maybe his goodwill would lead to good luck.	"Since I made that donation, maybe I can use a ball that doesn't have much pop in it," he said through a translator.	Nope, didn't quite work out that way.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

Dodgers pitcher Kenley Jansen reacts to defeating the Astros 6-2 to tie the series and looks ahead at taking on Dallas Keuchel in Game 5. (1:06)	HOUSTON -- Cody Bellinger pulled into second base with his first World Series hit and said: "It's a miracle!"	With the Dodgers three innings from falling into a deep deficit, the rookie slugger sparked a late comeback that stopped the Houston Astros' surge.	Hitless in 13 at-bats, Bellinger doubled and scored the tying run in the seventh inning , then doubled home the go-ahead run off struggling closer Ken Giles in a five-run ninth that lifted Los Angeles to a 6-2 win Saturday night and tied the Series at two games apiece.	"Sometimes you see in the postseason you want to try to do too much, and that's what I was doing," Bellinger said. "Today I tried to make an effort of not doing too much, and when you do that you get two hits sometimes. It's a crazy game."	George Springer put the Astros ahead with a two-out homer in the sixth , the first hit off Los Angeles starter Alex Wood. The crowd at Minute Maid Park, where Houston had been 7-0 this postseason, was revved up in anticipation of the Astros having a chance to win the first title in their 56-season history on Sunday.	Instead, the Series will go back to Los Angeles no matter what. Clayton Kershaw starts Game 5 for the Dodgers on Sunday night and Dallas Keuchel for the Astros in a rematch of the opener, when Kershaw pitched Los Angeles to a 3-1 win.	Bellinger, a 22-year-old bopper who set a National League rookie record with 39 home runs this season, struck out four times in Game 3 and once more in the fifth inning -- his eighth whiff of the Series.	Dodgers manager Dave Roberts expressed faith Friday night in Bellinger and again Saturday afternoon.	"He's got that calmness about him," Roberts said. "And when things speed up, he has a way of sort of resetting and not letting it spiral."	During batting practice, Bellinger tried to emulate teammates Andre Ethier and Logan Forsythe by hitting the ball to the opposite field.	"I was always told these really good hitters hit the ball the other way in BP and I had never done it, and I wanted to try it," he said. "I hit every ball in BP today to the left side of the infield. I've never done that before in my life. Usually I try to lift. I needed to make an adjustment."	Bellinger lined a fastball to the opposite field over Marwin Gonzalez into the quirky corner next to the left-field scoreboard, chasing starter Charlie Morton. He came home on Forsythe's two-out single off Will Harris.	Giles entered to start the ninth and got into immediate trouble, allowing a leadoff single to Corey Seager and a walk to Justin Turner. Bellinger took a low slider, then lined a fastball at the letters to left-center. He dropped his bat and raised a hand while running to first and clapped his hands half a dozen times in excitement after sliding into second.	"Every day you see him grow a little bit more," Wood said. "I think everybody kind of had the same message with him: `We believe in you. You're our guy. You're special. Remember that."	Joe Musgrove relieved and allowed Austin Barnes' sacrifice fly and Joc Pederson's three-run homer , his second home run of the Series.	"You like that! You like that!" Pederson yelled to teammates, a la Washington Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins , as he came back to dugout.	Wood, Brandon Morrow, winner Tony Watson and Kenley Jansen combined on a two-hitter -- the first-ever in the Series in which both hits were home runs. Jansen allowed Alex Bregman's two-out long ball in the ninth , the 15th home run of the Series, most ever through four games, before retiring Jose Altuve on a flyout.	Giles, the loser, was charged with three runs.	"They were all crappy pitches, not where I wanted them," he said. "I need to do better. I need to pick up this team. I need to carry my weight."	He has an 11.75 postseason ERA, allowing runs in six of seven appearances.	"When you're a back-end reliever," Astros manager A.J. Hinch said, "unless you're extraordinarily dominant, you're only talked about when you suffer, when you struggle. So for him, he can handle it mentally. He can handle it physically."	Springer put the Astros ahead when he drove a curveball, Wood's 84th and final pitch, over the left-field scoreboard and into the Crawford Boxes. Wood dropped to a knee on the mound and watched the ball land in the seats and rebound onto the field.	Houston was nine outs from winning for the 18th time in 20 home games since returning to Minute Maid Park after Hurricane Harvey, and from becoming the first major league team to start a postseason 8-0 at home.	But the Dodgers tied the score in the seventh. Bellinger pointed skyward when reaching second standing up on his opposite-field hit. He clapped both hands above his head, said "It's a miracle!" and pointed for the ball to be saved.	Los Angeles had been 1 for 17 with runners in scoring position before Forsythe's hit.	Making only his second appearance since Sept. 26, Wood accomplished a feat that eluded Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale, Orel Hershiser and other Dodgers pitching greats. In the team's 109th World Series game, Wood became the first Dodgers pitcher to hold an opponent hitless through five innings.	Houston had put a runner on in 14 consecutive innings before the 26-year-old lefty retired the side in order in the first.	Morton was nearly as stingy, allowing three hits in 6 1/3 innings. This was the first Series game in which both starters allowed four baserunners or fewer.	"The innings were rolling pretty quickly there the first four, five, six innings," Wood said. "It kept us both of us locked in."	Chris Taylor singled leading off the first but was thrown out on a delayed steal attempt that ended the inning, the first runner caught stealing by Houston catcher Brian McCann since June 18. That was part of a streak of 15 straight outs by Morton before he hit Barnes on the right forearm with a pitch leading off the sixth.	Enrique Hernandez's single put runners at the corners and Taylor hit a two-hopper to third that Bregman scooped on an in-between hop and threw home in plenty of time for McCann to tag Barnes, who tried to stop about 10 feet from the plate and fell. Bregman also threw out the Yankees' Greg Bird at the plate in the fifth inning of Game 7 in the AL Championship Series.	"We're a super-resilient team," Bellinger said. "Taking one here to make sure we go back to LA is huge."	---	More MLB baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

HOUSTON -- When the winning run finally came sliding across home plate on Alex Bregman's single, more than five unforgettable hours after the first pitch, a frantic Carlos Correa sprinted toward his Houston Astros teammates in the middle of the diamond.	Arm in the air, pure elation all over his face.	A last indelible image from a World Series classic filled with them.	Correa, Jose Altuve and the Astros kept hammering away in a wild slugfest that no one saw coming, rallying against Clayton Kershaw and rocking the Los Angeles Dodgers 13-12 in 10 thrilling innings Sunday night for a 3-2 lead.	"I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack out there," Correa said.	In a tension-filled game of monster momentum swings at pulsating Minute Maid Park, the last one belonged to Bregman . With the packed crowd still standing well past midnight, the 23-year-old third baseman hit an RBI single with two outs off Kenley Jansen.	"The best game ever, for sure," Correa said.	Wacky and whacky with seven home runs, this perhaps topped Toronto's 15-14 win over the Phillies in 1993 as the craziest World Series showdown ever.	Exhilaration and exhaustion, spread over 5 hours, 17 minutes.	"Yeah, five-hour game, but it doesn't matter. I can play a 10-hour game if we are going to win," Altuve said.	Now, with both bullpens worn down, the teams get a day to recover. Game 6 will be Tuesday night at Dodger Stadium, where Justin Verlander will try to clinch the Astros' first championship and Rich Hill hopes to save Los Angeles' season.	Altuve, Correa, Yuli Gurriel, George Springer and Brian McCann homered for Houston , the highest-scoring team in the majors this season.	Cody Bellinger and Yasiel Puig went deep for the Dodgers, who scored three times in the ninth to make it 12-all.	"It's hard to put into words all the twists and turns in that game," Astros manager A.J. Hinch said.	"These are just two really good teams, just throwing haymakers at each other trying to outlast each other," he said.	Silent when ace Dallas Keuchel got crushed, the orange-clad fans erupted over and over as the Astros sent balls careening all around -- and out of -- the park.	Yet on another night of Home Run Derby in the Year of the Home Run, no lead was safe.	Puig lined a two-run shot in the ninth, the record 22nd homer in a single Series, and Chris Taylor's two-out single off Chris Devenski tied it.	"I think this whole series has been an emotional roller coaster," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. "It's the two best teams playing for a championship. And these are two teams that play 27 outs."	More than that, in fact.	Houston posted its second extra-inning victory of the Series, adding to its 7-6, 11-inning comeback win in a dramatic Game 2.	With two down in the 10th, Jansen hit McCann on the hand with a pitch and Springer walked.	Bregman, who homered off Jansen in Saturday night's loss, lined the next pitch over shortstop to score pinch-runner Derek Fisher, who slid home ahead of the throw from left fielder Andre Ethier.	"We're up 3-2, baby," Bregman said.	Out of nowhere, the Astros climbed out of a four-run hole against Kershaw and then erased two more deficits later in the game, tying it each time on a homer.	Correa leaped and twirled after launching a two-run drive that made it 11-8 in the seventh . Much later, he hurdled the dugout railing the moment Bregman lined his winning single.	Bellinger hit a three-run drive in the fifth that made it 7-4 and seemed to swing things back in the Dodgers' favor. By the end of the mayhem on the mound, it was a mere afterthought.	Each team had 14 hits, eight for extra bases, and both used seven pitchers.	"Man, I'm mentally exhausted right now," Bellinger said.	Before the game, former Presidents George H.W. Bush and son George W. Bush were on the field for the first-pitch ceremony. By the end of the night, most everyone was bushed.	The Astros (13) and Dodgers (9) topped the Series mark for homers , set when Barry Bonds and the Giants lost to the Angels in seven games in 2002.	But really, who imagined this?	No wonder there's a bright sign high above the center field wall for a popular taco place in town -- it says Torchys and fit perfectly for a game where pitchers got lit up.	A day earlier, Kershaw stood alone on the mound after the Dodgers' dramatic win in Game 4, trying to get a visual for the biggest start of his career.	This was definitely not how he pictured it.	The three-time NL Cy Young Award winner cruised into the fourth with a 4-0 lead before things suddenly fell apart. After Correa hit an RBI double, Gurriel launched a tying, three-run drive.	Kershaw whipped his head around to watch Gurriel's drive sail, his face immediately showing shock, utter disbelief and frustration, all wrapped up in one expression before he bent over, hands on his knees.	Yanked in the fifth, Kershaw trudged off with a dubious distinction -- he has allowed a postseason-record eight home runs this year.	"Just exactly what you expect (when you) come to the park with Keuchel and Kershaw pitching," Hinch said.	Hardly a repeat performance from the opener, when Kershaw dominated while outpitching Keuchel for a 3-1 win.	Gurriel's second homer of the Series also kept open this possibility: Imagine the scene if Major League Baseball presents Gurriel with the MVP trophy, so soon after Commissioner Rob Manfred suspended him for the first five games next year for making a racist gesture toward Dodgers pitcher Yu Darvish.	Keuchel never got into a rhythm during the shortest home start of his All-Star career. His breaking pitches spun without much movement, and he was pulled in the fourth.	The Dodgers hadn't lost a game this year when they led by four runs. But Kershaw's bedeviling postseason past came back to haunt him at the worst time.	Kershaw was pulled after a pair of two-out walks in the bottom of the fifth. And with the crowd sensing something big, the 5-foot-6 Altuve connected off Kenta Maeda for a home run that made it 7-all.	"At that point, I talked to him before getting the at-bat: `This is your moment," Correa said. "And he didn't let me down. He hit a homer and got us going."	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

LOS ANGELES --  Joc Pederson sliced a drive over the left-field wall, pounded his chest and danced around the bases , taking as many twists and turns as this World Series itself.	Of course, the Los Angeles Dodgers forced the Houston Astros to Game 7.	Chris Taylor hit a tying double off Justin Verlander during a two-run rally in the sixth inning , Corey Seager followed with a go-ahead sacrifice fly and the Dodgers beat the Astros 3-1 on Tuesday night to push this dramatic Fall Classic to the ultimate game.	Pederson homered in the seventh against Joe Musgrove, connecting off the right-hander for the second time in three games and making it a record 24 long balls that have been hit in this Series. Pederson pranced all the way to the plate, pointing at the Dodgers' dugout and rubbing his thumbs and index fingers together to indicate what a money shot it was.	"You kind of black out in a situation like that. So I'm going to have to re-watch it to see what I did," Pederson said.	It was the third home run of the World Series for Pederson, demoted to the minors from mid-August until early September, then left off the NL Division Series roster. He had hit just one previous opposite-field homer in the big leagues this season, and teammates offered to pay him to go the other way.	"People are trying to get me encouraged to using the whole field," he said. "I'm not very good at it."	Yu Darvish starts Wednesday for the Dodgers, trying to win their first title since 1988, and Los Angeles ace Clayton Kershaw will be ready in the bullpen after getting knocked out in the fifth inning of Game 5.	"I can give you 27 innings," Kershaw said. "I'll be ready to go, whatever they need."	Lance McCullers Jr. gets the ball for the Astros in the first World Series Game 7 ever at Dodger Stadium and the first since 1931 between teams that won 100 games during the regular season.	Darvish was chased in the second inning of Game 2, when McCullers pitched Houston to a 5-3 victory.	"You've got two teams with a bunch of dogs in the clubhouse. No one is afraid," McCullers said.	Two nights after a 13-12, 10-inning slugfest under the roof at Minute Maid Park, pitching dominated.	George Springer's third-inning home run against starter Rich Hill had given a 1-0 lead to Verlander and the Astros, trying for the first championship in their 56-season history. On Halloween night, a title for a team with orange in its colors seemed appropriate.	But it served only to set up the 10th blown lead of the Series, the fifth by Houston, as Verlander fell to 9-1 with the Astros.	Dodgers relievers combined for 4 1/3 scoreless innings. Brandon Morrow retired Alex Bregman on a grounder to strand the bases loaded in the fifth,winner Tony Watson got Marwin Gonzalez to line out to leaping second baseman Chase Utley with two on and two outs in the sixth , and Kenta Maeda escaped two-on trouble in the seventh when third baseman Justin Turner gloved Jose Altuve's grounder and made a short-hop throw that first baseman Cody Bellinger scooped just in time.	"The pick is big," Houston manager A.J. Hinch said.	After wasting a ninth-inning lead in Game 2 and losing Game 5, Kenley Jansen retired six straight batters on 19 pitches for the save and ended it by striking out 40-year-old pinch-hitter Carlos Beltran.	This will be the third World Series Game 7 in four years. The home team had won nine straight since 1979 before San Francisco triumphed at Kansas City in 2014 and the Chicago Cubs captured their first title since 1908 at Cleveland last year.	Ten of the last 12 teams that won Game 6 to force a seventh game also won the title, but the Dodgers lost the previous six World Series in which they trailed 3-2. They have won just one of their six championships at home, in 1963.	A heat wave over and the skies overcast, the temperature dropped to 67 degrees at game time from 103 for last week's opener, and there was a slight drizzle in the middle innings.	Los Angelenos with a laid-back reputation were on their feet for two-strike counts against Astros batters, a wave in Pantone 294 -- also known as Dodger blue.	"We feed off the crowd, for sure," Taylor said. "We feel we have a huge home-field advantage."	Yuli Gurriel, who made a racist gesture toward Darvish in Game 3, was booed loudly during introductions and each time he batted, and Hill stepped off the rubber to allow the crowd extra time to jeer.	Verlander has 11 postseason wins but dropped to 0-4 in the Series with Detroit and Houston, which acquired him from the Tigers on Aug. 31 to win on nights like this. He allowed just one baserunner before Austin Barnes singled leading off the sixth. Verlander bounced a pitch that hit Utley on the front of his right foot, and Taylor sent a 97 mph fastball down the right-field line as Barnes came home. Seager followed with a sacrifice fly to the warning track, a ball that likely would have landed in the pavilion in last week's hot air.	Verlander prevented more damag e when Turner fouled out and the right-hander fanned Bellinger, who struck out four times for the second time in the Series.	Springer homered for the third straight game and fourth time in the Series, one shy of the record set by Reggie Jackson in 1977 and matched by Utley in 2009.	Brian McCann singled leading off the fifth and Gonzalez doubled past Turner and down the left-field line. Hill struck out Josh Reddick and Verlander, and Springer was intentionally walked to load the bases.	Morrow relieved as the crowd booed manager Dave Roberts' decision, and Hill slapped at four cups of liquid in the dugout, sending them spraying against the wall	"With Verlander on the mound, that was going to be the game," Roberts said.	Appearing in his sixth straight Series game, Morrow got Bregman to ground to shortstop on his second pitch.	Watson walked Reddick leading off the seventh, Evan Gattis pinch hit for Verlander and Maeda relieved. Gattis bounced to shortstop, just beating Utley's throw from second to avoid a double play. Springer reached on an infield single, and Bregman's fly to deep center allowed pinch-runner Derek Fisher to tag up and advance to third, bringing up Altuve.	Walking down the dugout steps after his groundout, Altuve slammed his helmet.	Afterward, attention quickly turned to Wednesday.	"I think it seems fitting," Roberts said. "These two teams mirror one another."	Pederson sat in the interview room with his older brother, Champ , who has Down Syndrome.	"I have a feeling that everything is possible," Champ said. "I'm not going to say they have it, but I'm just going to say they will find a way."	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.
