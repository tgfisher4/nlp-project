CHICAGO -- Home runs come a lot easier than triples for Albert Pujols.	The St. Louis star managed one of each Friday as the Cardinals beat the Chicago Cubs 8-3 to kick off the final weekend before the All-Star break.	"I was a little tired, but I don't mind," Pujols said of legging out his first three-bagger since September 2007, to help the Cardinals build an early a 3-0 lead.	His liner went into the left-fielder corner where Cubs left fielder Alfonso Soriano had trouble picking it up.	"When I hit it I was actually thinking it was a double. I saw [Alfonso] Soriano bobble it once, so I had a pretty good opportunity to keep going," Pujols said.	After Chicago tied it on Derrek Lee's three-run homer, Pujols put first-place St. Louis up for good with his 32nd homer, a drive to straightaway center in the fifth that landed in a basket above the ivy-covered wall.	"He's dangerous at the plate and on the base paths, too," Chicago starter and loser Rich Harden said. "He's one of the smartest baserunners out there."	Pujols reached base four times, as did teammate Ryan Ludwick, who drove in four runs. Ludwick has regrouped after coming off the disabled list (hamstring) in May.	"For a four- or-five week period when I came back, I couldn't hit water if I fell out of a boat," Ludwick said. "I just felt [today] like we put together good at-bats."	Chris Carpenter (7-3) worked six innings, allowing seven hits and three runs with six strikeouts. The Cardinals' ace improved his career record against the Cubs to 9-3, including 6-2 at Wrigley Field.	The victory put the first-place Cardinals eight games over .500 and knocked the struggling Cubs 4 1/2 games out of the lead in the NL Central. St. Louis has now won the opener on each of its three stops on a 10-game road trip.	"That's how you want to start a series," Cardinals manager Tony LaRussa said.	Harden (5-6) threw 101 pitches in five innings, giving up seven hits and four runs. Aaron Heilman relieved in the sixth and the Cardinals quickly added four more runs.	St. Louis loaded the bases on a single and two walks and Ludwick delivered a two-run single that put St. Louis up 6-3.	Rick Ankiel walked to reload the bases and the Cards got another run when Cubs left fielder Alfonso Soriano couldn't hold Yadier Molina's shallow fly. No error was charged on the play because Soriano picked the ball up and was able to force Ankiel at second. Heilman then threw a wild pitch to allow the fourth run to cross.	"At the last moment my eyes went off the ball," Soriano said. "The way we played today, we're not supposed to play like that."	Harden agreed.	"It was embarrassing today, you know. We were outplayed and outhustled," he said.	Lee's three-run homer, an opposite-field drive to the right-field bleachers, followed singles by Harden and Ryan Theriot, was his 17th of the season. That was by far the Cubs' highlight as they lost their third straight.	"We didn't play well," he said. "It was a little disappointing, knowing the importance of this series. ... Just like that, you're 4 1/2 back. It's dangerous territory."	Ludwick had a sacrifice fly in the first and three singles for St. Louis.	Game notes	 Carpenter has allowed only four homers all season. ... Pujols drew an intentional walk in the first, his 32nd this season. ... Mark DeRosa, who spent the previous two seasons with the Cubs, returned to Wrigley Field sooner than expected. DeRosa was with the Indians three weeks ago when they visited for an interleague series. On Friday he was back in Chicago with the Cardinals, who acquired him from Cleveland in a June 27 trade. "It's kind of weird," said DeRosa, who is on the disabled list with a wrist injury. "I found myself on a last place team and within a couple of days I'm in first place in the NL Central, battling against the Cubs."	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

BALTIMORE -- His work done, Brett Cecil joined friends and family to watch the postgame fireworks display at Camden Yards.	Cecil outpitched Jason Berken in a duel between struggling rookies, and the Toronto Blue Jays beat the Baltimore Orioles 2-0 Friday night to snap a three-game skid.	Cecil (3-1) allowed four hits over six innings to earn his first win in five starts since May 15. It was a delightful homecoming for Cecil, who grew up in Dunkirk, Md., and played for the University of Maryland before being drafted by Toronto in the first round of the 2007 draft.	"I only left 15 tickets but ... there's a ton more people that came," the left-hander said. "I saw guys up there that I haven't seen in a while that came down to congratulate me. I love coming home to play."	Cecil came in with a 6.23 ERA and yielded 12 runs in his previous two starts, but he had no trouble against the Orioles.	"Playing in front of the home crowd was awesome," he said. "I heard a lot of people out there."	Scott Downs, the fourth Blue Jays reliever, worked a perfect ninth for his ninth save.	Berken (1-6) gave up two runs and five hits in 5 2/3 innings. The right-hander lowered his ERA from 6.25 to 5.87 but remained winless since beating Toronto in his first major league start on May 26.	"I felt pretty good the way I threw the ball tonight," Berken said.	But Cecil was better.	"It happens sometimes," Berken said. "Brett threw really well tonight. You just tip your cap to him."	Both teams were without their managers. Baltimore's Dave Trembley started a two-game suspension for actions following his ejection in Seattle on Tuesday night, and Toronto's Cito Gaston left to attend the funeral of his sister. Dave Jauss replaced Trembley and Brian Butterfield took over for Gaston.	Asked how it felt to watch in the stands, Trembley replied, "I'd rather go to the dentist. That's tough. We got one done. Now I've got one more to go."	Alex Rios hit two doubles and scored a run for Toronto, but Scott Rolen's 25-game hitting streak ended with an 0-for-4 performance.	That might have been the only downer on a night in which the Blue Jays (44-44) won for only the third time in 13 games. The slide dropped Toronto under .500 for the first time this season.	"I think [we] continue to show a lot of resiliency," Butterfield said. "You can feel good about the players in this clubhouse, you feel good about the leadership in this clubhouse, you feel good about the leadership that Cito provides. So it's definitely a great win in a tough division."	The Blue Jays broke open a scoreless game with a two-run fifth. Lyle Overbay ended a 3-for-37 skid with a leadoff single and went to third on a double by Rios. Dave Dellucci followed with an RBI groundout and Raul Chavez doubled in a run.	"If we would have said Berken would get us that late in the game and given up two runs, we would have taken it," Trembley said. "He pitched great. We didn't score any runs. That's the game."	Toronto used a walk and a two-out double by Rios to put runners on second and third in the second, but Berken got Dellucci to ground out.	Baltimore loaded the bases with two outs in the bottom half before Cesar Izturis grounded out.	"He was good," Izturis said of Cecil. "He was throwing strikes, his sinker was very good, and the changeup. He struggled in the second inning, but he got out of it."	Game notes	 Baltimore's Luke Scott extended his hitting streak to 10 games, tying his career high. ... Izturis (appendix) was activated from the 15-day DL before the game. ... Toronto extended its run of games with at least one double to 18.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DETROIT -- Edwin Jackson tuned up for his first All-Star Game with another strong outing for the Detroit Tigers.	Jackson pitched seven sharp innings to help the Tigers beat Cliff Lee and the Cleveland Indians 5-1 on Friday night.	Marcus Thames hit a two-run homer in the eighth inning for Detroit, which has won three straight. Josh Anderson had a two-run single.	Jackson (7-4) allowed four hits, including Ryan Garko's homer. The right-hander stopped a five-start winless stretch, earning his first victory since June 6.	"He was tremendous," Tigers manager Jim Leyland said. "That's a pretty good showing to do what he did tonight."	Jackson threw as hard as 96 mph but recorded most of his outs on easy fly balls or grounders. He struck out four and walked two.	"Strikeouts will come, but you want quick outs all the time," Jackson said. "You have to pitch to contact."	The Indians put runners on second and third with one out in the eighth, but Bobby Seay struck out Shin-Soo Choo and got Travis Hafner to pop out. Fernando Rodney loaded the bases with two outs in the ninth but retired Grady Sizemore on a groundout to third to end the game.	Lee (4-9) gave up three runs and five hits in seven innings. The reigning AL Cy Young Award winner lost his third consecutive start despite striking out eight.	"I was disappointed we couldn't get any runs for him," Indians manager Eric Wedge said. "But he pitched like the No. 1 he is. He does everything he can do to win games for us."	Lee's only bad inning was the second. All-Star Brandon Inge and Magglio Ordonez opened with singles. Gerald Laird then hit an RBI double. After Adam Everett struck out, Anderson singled in a pair to make it 3-0.	"I can only control what I can control," said Lee, who hasn't won since he shut out St. Louis on June 14. "I can't score runs for us, which has been a problem for us all season."	Cleveland is averaging less than four runs per game in Lee's 20 starts.	Anderson did not return to center field after Lee hit him with a pitch in the fifth. The Tigers said he had a bruised right triceps.	Detroit reliever Joel Zumaya threw just two pitches in the eighth before leaving with a cut on the top of his right thumb.	Game notes	 Tigers OF Carlos Guillen (shoulder) could start a rehab assignment as early as this weekend. "He really looks good," Leyland said of Guillen, who's been out since May 5. "You can tell by looking at him that he feels good." ... Indians RHP Jake Westbrook (Tommy John surgery) threw 50 pitches in Cleveland. Trainer Lonnie Soloff said the session went well and Westbrook will go through a similar workout Monday. ... Inge will take part in Monday's home run derby. ... Garko and Detroit's Miguel Cabrera each extended their hitting streaks to 10 games. ... Cleveland signed OF Jason Kipnis, its second-round draft pick.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PHILADELPHIA -- Joe Blanton and the Philadelphia Phillies are rolling as the first half of the season winds down.	Blanton pitched into the eighth inning, Jayson Werth drove in two runs on the same day he was named to his first All-Star team and Philadelphia beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 3-2 on Friday night.	The NL East-leading Phillies have won seven of eight, all at home, after entering their 10-game homestand with 14 losses in 18 games.	"Here lately, it's kind of like we're getting used to winning again," manager Charlie Manuel said.	Blanton (6-4) allowed one run and four hits over 7 1/3 innings in his second consecutive effective outing. The right-hander pitched 7 1/3 innings in Philadelphia's 2-0 victory over the New York Mets on Sunday, and is 4-1 with a 2.44 ERA in his last nine starts.	"It does feel good," Blanton said of the Phillies' winning stretch. "A couple more [wins] to close it out and take the momentum into the second half."	Manuel liked the way Blanton attacked the Pirates, calling him "a bulldog."	"The fastball makes him go and he's not afraid to use his fastball," Manuel said. "He's throwing the ball good right now."	Werth, picked by Manuel to replace injured outfielder Carlos Beltran on the NL All-Star roster, hit a two-run double in the third to give the Phillies a 3-1 lead.	Fellow All-Star Shane Victorino went 3 for 4 with two doubles for Philadelphia, and is 17 for 34 in his last eight games.	Pittsburgh's Zach Duke (8-8) tossed his third complete game of the season, allowing five hits, and lost for the fourth time in his last five decisions. He allowed only one hit, Victorino's eighth-inning double, after the third.	Duke is winless in his last seven road starts and Pittsburgh has scored just 18 runs in his eight losses.	"Duke did a great job against a great offensive team," Pittsburgh manager John Russell said. "Both pitchers did a great job."	Garrett Jones and Brandon Moss homered for the Pirates, who have lost seven of nine. All-Star Freddy Sanchez, returning to the lineup after missing the last six games with lower back tightness, went 2 for 4 with a double.	Moss connected against Brad Lidge with two out in the ninth, but pinch-hitter Delwyn Young struck out to end the game. Lidge earned his 18th save in 24 chances.	Game notes	 The Phillies activated All-Star left fielder Raul Ibanez from the disabled list. Ibanez, who missed 20 games with a groin injury, was available to pinch hit but did not play. Manuel said the outfielder would be in the starting lineup Saturday. ... Pittsburgh center fielder Andrew McCutchen's error in the third was the Pirates' first error in a season-high 66 2/3 innings.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BOSTON -- Jon Lester produced another masterpiece against the Kansas City Royals at Fenway Park.	And it was his worst performance against them at home.	Lester (8-6) allowed four hits in eight innings in Boston's 1-0 victory Friday night. That wasn't as good as the no-hitter he threw against them on May 19, 2008 or the one hit he gave them in eight scoreless innings on July 18, 2006.	"Obviously, he was terrific," Red Sox manager Terry Francona said. "He had to be because their guy was so good."	Brian Bannister (6-7) limited Boston to one hit through seven innings before leaving a pitch too far over the plate that Dustin Pedroia was able to lift off the left-field wall for the tiebreaking double in the eighth.	"I lost the game because I gave up a hit to the reigning MVP of the league," Bannister said. "I'm extremely disappointed that I lost this game for our team, but it was as good a game as I've ever pitched in my life."	Lester is 3-1 against the Royals, losing only in Kansas City. In Boston, he's given them five hits and eight walks with 21 strikeouts in 25 innings.	"You still have to go out and execute pitches, regardless if you are facing a high school team, or you're facing the Yankees, or you're facing the Royals," he said. "It doesn't matter."	Mark Teahen had three of the four hits off Lester then popped up for the final out in the ninth against Jonathan Papelbon, who got his 23rd save in 25 opportunities. Teahen had the only hit in Lester's one-hit performance three years ago.	"I don't think [I'm] really solving him," Teahen said. "I was able to stay simple enough in my approach to barrel some balls. ... He was on his game tonight."	Lester walked two and had eight strikeouts. Bannister went 7 2/3 innings, giving up three hits and four walks while striking out seven.	Mark Kotsay, playing with a calf injury, led off the bottom of the eighth against Bannister with a clean single to center. Aaron Bates, called up to the majors for the first time on Monday, pinch ran and took second on Nick Green's sacrifice bunt.	Bannister threw a wild pitch in the dirt and Bates moved to third. Pedroia, coming off consecutive three-hit games, hit his first ball out of the infield on Friday for his double.	"I never squared up a ball [on his first three at-bats] and so my biggest thing was try and hit it on the barrel," Pedroia said. "That's the worst feeling as a pitcher to throw that good and not win. For their guy, he threw the ball great. And Lester was just a little bit better, I guess."	Bannister intentionally walked Kevin Youkilis before John Bale came on and retired David Ortiz on a groundout.	Both pitchers entered the game on a roll. Lester was 4-1 in his previous seven starts with a 1.74 ERA. Bannister had a 2.48 ERA in his last six starts but just a 2/3 record.	On Friday, he held the Red Sox hitless through four innings, allowing only walks to Youkilis in the first and J.D. Drew in the third.	But Jacoby Ellsbury led off the fifth with a single and got his 38th stolen base before Jason Varitek walked. Varitek was out at second and Ellsbury took third on Kotsay's force-play grounder.	With Green up, Kotsay took off for second and was caught in a rundown. Ellsbury raced home and appeared to slide in before catcher Miguel Olivo could tag him. After being called out Ellsbury bounced his helmet hard and was ejected by plate umpire Derryl Cousins.	But Rocco Baldelli, his replacement in center field came up with a big play in the seventh.	Jose Guillen led off and reached first on a throwing error by third baseman Youkilis then took second on Teahan's single, his sixth hit in eight at-bats in the series.	Olivo sent Baldelli to the warning track in straightaway center. Both runners tried to advance. Guillen made it to third, but Teahen was called out at second when he overslid the bag and was tagged by second baseman Pedroia.	Game notes	 The Royals obtained SS Yuniesky Betancourt and cash considerations from Seattle for RHP Danny Cortes and LHP Derrick Saito. ... Guillen has gone 13 games without an extra-base hit. ... Ortiz, who has 10 homers in his last 30 games, went 0 for 4 with three strikeouts. ... Kansas City hasn't had a day off in 18 days.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

NEW YORK -- The Mets are sinking fast, and Bronson Arroyo kept getting them to beat the ball into the ground.	Arroyo threw a four-hitter for his second career shutout, Joey Votto and Laynce Nix homered off Fernando Nieve, and the Cincinnati Reds defeated helpless New York 3-0 Friday night.	"I had kind of a hard changeup that was diving down," said Arroyo, who got 15 ground-ball outs. "Obviously, having a watered-down lineup helped, too."	Before the game, New York traded Ryan Church to the Atlanta Braves for Jeff Francoeur and cash in a swap of outfielders who had fallen out of favor with their teams. The Mets then went out and lost for the sixth time in seven games and 11th in 14, drawing frequent and loud boos from the crowd of 39,203 at Citi Field.	With Carlos Delgado, Jose Reyes and Carlos Beltran on the disabled list, more deals could be ahead if the Mets fade further in the NL East before the July 31 deadline for trades without waivers. Following a 28-21 start, the Mets have gone 12-24 since May and dropped five games under .500 for the first time since an 0-5 start in 2005 under new manager Willie Randolph. They've fallen 6 1/2 games behind first-place Philadelphia.	"Lately we've had to play perfect to win each and every game," said David Wright, batting .227 since Beltran went on the DL. "When you don't score, you can't win. It's as simple as that."	Since Beltran last played June 21, New York has scored three runs or fewer in 13 of 18 games and been shut out five times.  The Mets have three shutout losses in a five-game span for the first time since getting blanked three times in a row July 25-27, 1992, according to STATS LLC.	New York did not get a runner to second base against Arroyo, and has not homered in 66 consecutive innings since Fernando Tatis connected at Pittsburgh on July 2.	"It becomes difficult to explain it," manager Jerry Manuel said.	A night after losing to Los Angeles Dodgers lefty Randy Wolf, who had been winless in seven starts, the Mets fell to Arroyo (9-8), who had been 1-5 in seven outings since May. Arroyo struck out five and walked none in his eighth complete game in 211 starts. His other shutout was a three-hitter against San Francisco on Sept. 5, 2006.	"He was dealing tonight," Reds manager Dusty Baker said. "That's the most ground balls I've seen in a long time."	New York's only hits were a bloop single by Nieve in the third, a bunt single by Argenis Reyes in the sixth, and clean singles by Daniel Murphy in the seventh and ninth.	After Angel Pagan's leadoff flyout to center fielder Willy Taveras, who made a sliding catch, the Reds didn't have another outfield putout until pinch-hitter Gary Sheffield flied out to left ending the eighth.	"You're obviously thankful not to see Reyes, Beltran and Delgado in the lineup," said Arroyo, 6-1 in his last eight starts against the Mets. "Anybody who says they want to see those guys in the lineup so they can face them is crazy."	Cincinnati, which hasn't had a winning record since 2000, entered fifth in the six-team NL Central at 41-43 and had lost four of its previous five games.	Nieve (3-3) pitched decently but lost his third straight outing following a 3-0 start with New York. He gave up three runs and eight hits in six innings.	Votto put the Reds ahead in the fourth with a drive about two rows into the left-field seats, just the sixth opposite-field homer at Citi Field. The Reds made it 2-0 when Brandon Phillips doubled, took third on a wild pitch and scored as Jerry Hairston Jr. missed a squeeze bunt. Wright took the throw from Brian Schneider, had trouble getting the ball out of his glove and then threw high to the plate, with the ball glancing off the top of the catcher's glove. Phillips was credited with a steal of home.	Nix homered with one out in the sixth, driving the ball into the second deck in right.	Votto's drive was the most impressive.	"I hit it pretty good, and I got a little loft on it, but I almost tripped over first base watching it," he said. "I thought it had a chance to go out, but I've heard so many things about this place, I wasn't sure."	Game notes	 The crowd set a Guinness record in the middle of the second inning for most potato chips crunched simultaneously, part of a promotion. ... Mets RHP John Maine (shoulder) threw a bullpen session and Manuel said he could return by the end of the month. ... New York didn't homer in 70 consecutive innings from May 13-22, according to STATS.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Jeff Niemann didn't win his spot in Tampa Bay's rotation until the end of spring training. It's turning out that late decision was a good one.	Niemann pitched a six-hitter and the Rays got home runs from Carlos Pena and Evan Longoria in a 6-0 victory over the Oakland Athletics on Friday night.	"He's probably pitching his best professional baseball right now, including all of his minor league stuff," Tampa Bay manager Joe Maddon said. "He's just gaining confidence. He was in total command."	Niemann (8-4), the Rays' No. 5 starter, has two shutouts this season. The 6-foot-9 right-hander, who is 6-1 over his last 10 starts, allowed two hits in a 2-0 win over Kansas City on June 3.	"It's good, but it's only halfway through," Niemann said. "We have another three months left, so you can't get too happy or contented."	An official scoring change after the game gave Oakland's Ryan Sweeney a two-out single in the ninth inning instead of a fielder's choice, which added a hit to Niemann's original line.	"I knew when he was warming up in the 'pen his arm angle was pretty good," Rays catcher Dioner Navarro said. "He needs to get on top of that ball and that's the way he pitched. He was throwing the ball downhill and he was getting ahead."	Niemann struck out six and walked three.	"A tall guy like that with good stuff, they don't see it every day," Maddon said.	Oakland third baseman Adam Kennedy agreed.	"He's a big guy and his fastball gets on you fast," Kennedy said. "He kind of works wild in the zone. It's not really on the middle of the plate."	Pena hit his 24th homer of the season and Longoria added a solo shot for Tampa Bay, which has won nine in a row at home. The Rays are 19-8 overall since June 10.	Oakland right-hander Vin Mazzaro (2-5) allowed three runs and seven hits over five innings in losing his fifth straight decision. The Athletics (35-49) have lost 11 of 15 to drop a season-high 14 games under .500.	Struggling Oakland first baseman Jason Giambi, dropped to seventh in the lineup, struck out twice and went 0 for 3 with a walk. He is hitting .193.	The Rays took advantage of two Oakland defensive lapses to take a 1-0 lead in the first. One pitch after Giambi and Mazzaro failed to catch a foul ball, B.J. Upton doubled. Upton went to third when shortstop Orlando Cabrera was charged with an error for missing Mazzaro's pickoff attempt, and later scored on Carl Crawford's grounder.	"I couldn't see that ball up there," Oakland manager Bob Geren said about Upton's foul. "It's crazy. It's a white dome with stuff going all across."	Pena made it 2-0 with a solo home run in the fourth. It was his first homer since June 27.	Ben Zobrist walked with the bases loaded to put the Rays up 3-0 in the fifth. Tampa Bay took a 4-0 lead one inning later when Dioner Navarro was hit by pitch and later scored on a wild pitch by Santiago Casilla.	Longoria snapped an 18-game homerless stretch with his 17th this season, and Pat Burrell hit an RBI double in the seventh.	Game notes	 Tampa Bay principal owner Stuart Sternberg, on a conference call, said he doesn't anticipate cutting the Rays' payroll if the team stays in the playoff hunt this season. The Rays started Friday with the majors' fifth-lowest average home attendance at 22,699, which is considerably lower than the defending AL champions had projected. Friday's attendance was 20,358. ... Athletics LHP Dallas Braden is scheduled to return from the bereavement list and start Saturday's game. ... Oakland RHP Justin Duchscherer (right elbow) could be ready to pitch in a minor league game by late this month. ... Tampa Bay LHP Brian Shouse (left elbow) threw 32 pitches in a simulated game and will pitch in another one Monday.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

MILWAUKEE -- Manny Ramirez called it just another home run. Dodgers manager Joe Torre acknowledged the feat was special while noting in the same breath the suspicion that will hang over the enigmatic slugger's final numbers.	Ramirez tied Mickey Mantle on the career home run chart early, and Matt Kemp hit a 10th-inning grand slam and made a fantastic catch for the final out to lead the Los Angeles Dodgers over the struggling Milwaukee Brewers 12-8 on Friday night.	"It feels good, but it's just like another home run," said Ramirez, who was distracted watching film of at-bats against the Phillies and swinging his arms gently through an imaginary strike zone. "It makes me proud, but like I said it's just another home run that I hit. I didn't even know I tied him."	Ramirez's 536th homer pulled him even with Mantle for 15th place, and the Dodgers rallied against Trevor Hoffman in the ninth. Casey Blake drove in Ramirez with a triple in the 10th, and Kemp's slam broke it open moments later.	"Manny's a special talent, he's a special player, so was Mickey, obviously," Torre said. "I know there's going to be some questions for the rest of his career. I'm not sure you can question how many he hits, it's how far they go. I think that's really what affects it more than anything else."	Andre Ethier, James Loney and Russell Martin also homered for the Dodgers (55-31), who will enter the All-Star break with the best record in the majors.	Ramirez continued his torrid pace since returning from a 50-game drug suspension, hitting a two-run shot in the sixth. With two on in the 10th, Kemp made a running, over-the-shoulder grab of Jason Kendall's drive to deep center with his back to home plate, similar to Willie Mays' famous catch in the 1954 World Series.	"I was messing around with it in batting practice today," said Kemp, who ran up the wall for show after the catch. "I guess I thought I'd use it in the game."	Torre joked it was more like Wesley Snipes' character in Major League: "He comes in and says, 'Willie Mays Hayes."	Brewers manager Ken Macha said it was a fitting end.	"To rub a little salt in our wounds the guy makes an over-the-shoulder catch to end it," Brewers manager Ken Macha said. "It's a little disappointing to lose two days in a row having a one-run lead late."	This loss was especially painful for the Brewers because Hoffman blew a save opportunity for the second time this year and Carlos Villanueva (2-6) gave up six runs in the 10th for his second loss in as many days.	The five Dodgers homers marked their biggest power surge since hitting seven against the San Diego Padres nearly three years ago, but small ball paid off first.	"You better win if you do that," Torre said. "That's not normally what our signature is, but we certainly put them to good use tonight."	Ramirez walked with one out in the 10th and Blake, who had been 0 for 4, hammered a pitch off the wall in right-center field that allowed Ramirez to easily score.	Juan Pierre intentionally walked and Martin hit an infield single that scored Blake. Orlando Hudson walked to load the bases and Kemp's homer landed in the second deck in left field, sending fans streaming to the exits.	Ramon Troncoso (3-0) struck out Ryan Braun with the winning run at second to end the ninth and Jonathan Broxton gave up two runs in the bottom of the 10th in his second straight shaky appearance after allowing three in Sunday's 13-inning win against the Padres.	Rookie Mat Gamel and J.J. Hardy homered for the Brewers, who have lost seven of nine and fell three games behind first-place St. Louis in the NL Central to match their largest deficit since May 7.	Gamel's homer in the eighth put Milwaukee up 6-5, but Hoffman gave it back after converting 19 of his first 20 save chances.	Martin singled to start the ninth, advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt by Hudson, reached third on Kemp's bunt single and scored when Mark Loretta singled up the middle to tie it at 6.	"Against teams like that, it's important to close the door," Hoffman said. "I was just trying to be aggressive. It comes with the territory."	Game notes	 Ramirez is 7 of 22 with three homers, nine RBIs and seven runs scored in seven games since returning to the lineup. ... Brewers RHP Dave Bush (triceps) allowed four hits and an unearned run in 4 2/3 innings at Class-A Wisconsin in his first rehab start. He could return to the rotation as soon as July 20. ... Brewers RF Corey Hart (foot) missed his third straight game.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

HOUSTON -- Geoff Blum drove in the winning run for Houston the night after barking at an Astros fan who criticized his effort.	Blum's bases-loaded single scored Miguel Tejada in the ninth inning and the Astros rallied after Roy Oswalt was injured to beat the Washington Nationals 6-5 on Friday night.	Blum drove home the winning run in the Astros' last at-bat for the third time this season. He did it in consecutive games against the Chicago Cubs in June. Houston won for the ninth time in their last at-bat.	The third baseman was a hot topic on local sports radio Friday after yelling at a fan who booed him during Thursday's 9-4 victory over Washington. Blum led off an inning with a double and said the fan called him out for not making it a triple.	"After last night, it was interesting to say the least," Blum said. "I got a chance at redemption and I took advantage of it."	Michael Bourn drove in three runs and assisted on two putouts at the plate to help the Astros (43-43) reach .500 for the first time since they were 1-1 on April 7.	Houston manager Cecil Cooper said Bourn is the Astros' most valuable player in the first half of the season. The speedy center fielder went 2-for-5 and stole a base.	"It's always a compliment to hear your manager say that," Bourn said. "That's a good compliment for the first half, but I've still got a long way to go."	Oswalt allowed three runs and five hits before leaving in the seventh with numbness in two fingers in his right hand. He hurt his hand when he broke his bat on a groundout in the sixth, but he expects to make his next scheduled start, the first game after the All-Star break.	"I'm sure I'll be fine," he said.	Tejada led off the ninth with a single against Joe Beimel (0-5), who retired Lance Berkman before being replaced by Mike MacDougal. Tejada moved up on Carlos Lee's fly out to center and Hunter Pence was intentionally walked.	MacDougal struggled with his control after putting on Pence, throwing a wild pitch and walking Ivan Rodriguez before Blum singled to right to end the game.	The Nationals have lost five straight and nine of their last 11.	"It's at the point where it's just embarrassing for us," Beimel said. "I think everyone in the clubhouse should be embarrassed about the way we play and just the way we lose games.	"We find a way all the time. It's just sickening."	Beimel gave up Jeff Keppinger's tying sacrifice fly in the eighth. Blum helped set up the run when he doubled after the Nationals misplayed his foul pop earlier in the at-bat.	Jeff Fulchino (3-3) got the win with some help from Bourn in the ninth. Nyjer Morgan hit a one-out single to center with Willie Harris on second but Bourn made a perfect throw to the plate to keep the game tied at 5.

MINNEAPOLIS -- The Minnesota Twins have often pestered the Chicago White Sox with their small-ball style.	Their bunting success has dropped off drastically this season, but the Twins went back to old ways and beat the White Sox to begin an important series.	Joe Mauer's two-out single snapped a seventh-inning tie, and Nick Blackburn and the Twins hung on for a 6-4 victory over the White Sox on Friday night.	After being swept during the week by the New York Yankees, third-place Minnesota stayed four games behind the Detroit Tigers in the AL Central race. The White Sox are 3 1/2 games back.	Mauer drove in Nick Punto, who started with a walk against Octavio Dotel (1-3) and moved up on a sacrifice by Denard Span and a stolen base. In the eighth, Matt Tolbert stole third and scored on a perfect two-out bunt by Carlos Gomez against Bobby Jenks.	"They can do a lot of good things," said White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen, who was so famously frustrated by the Twins' contact hitters he started calling them "The Piranhas" for their pesky yet dangerous skills.	Gomez set a Minnesota record last year with 30 bunt hits, but this year with less playing time and opposing third basemen frequently playing in he hasn't made much of an impact with that weapon at all.	It's not just him. Manager Ron Gardenhire and his coaches have been trying to get the other speed-based players in the lineup to bunt more, but with little success.	"Make things happen," Gardenhire said.	Gomez, who raised his average to .222, was asked if he'd be more intentional about bunting in the second half.	"It depends on what kind of situation. ... I don't want to drop a bunt when everybody plays 3 feet away in the grass," he said.	Blackburn (8-4) went seven innings despite an absence of his best stuff.	"I was all over the place," he said.	Matt Guerrier and Joe Nathan were perfect in the eighth and ninth, though; Nathan notched his 23rd save and gave Minnesota nine wins in the last 10 meetings against Chicago at the Metrodome.	"So? I couldn't care less," said White Sox catcher A.J. Pierzynski, who had three hits against his original team. "Tomorrow's a new day. We can lose 100 in a row, but the next day is always a chance to win."	The Twins took a 4-0 lead against Chicago starter John Danks in the first inning, but let the White Sox come back to tie it. This was not close to the duel Blackburn and Danks produced on that crisp night in Chicago last September when the White Sox topped the Twins 1-0 to win the AL Central tiebreaker game and move on to the playoffs.	After giving up only 22 hits and six runs over 35 2/3 innings in his previous five starts, Danks walked the first four batters he faced before a two-run double by Jason Kubel and an RBI single by Michael Cuddyer stretched the lead to 4-0.	"It's the first time I've ever walked four in a row," Danks said. "Little League. High school. You name it."	Cuddyer was too casual with his lead at first base, though, and he gave Danks his first out by getting picked off. The lefty quickly ended the inning and allowed just two hits and a walk during the rest of his outing -- which lasted 5 2/3 innings.	"He saved the bullpen. He deserves a lot of credit for what he was able to do," Pierzynski said, praising Danks.	Pierzynski was in the middle of nearly every rally with a single and a pair of doubles. The second one put runners at second and third with no outs in the sixth, but Cuddyer made a leaping catch against the wall in right field to hold Chris Getz -- who had two RBIs -- to a sacrifice fly. Slick stops by Joe Crede and Nick Punto on sharp grounders made the next two outs.	"He didn't have his greatest stuff, but it's about grinding it out and getting deep in the game," Gardenhire said.	Game notes	 Guillen said struggling LH Clayton Richard will remain in the rotation after the All-Star break, because there aren't any alternatives for now. The White Sox are waiting for Bartolo Colon to complete his rehab assignment, and Freddy Garcia is also working his way back in the minors. ... Twins LH Glen Perkins is finally feeling better and will start on Saturday, three days after he fell ill. Perkins is also slated to take the mound next Friday in Texas, when the rotation is reset to start the second half.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

DENVER -- Coors Field has been a house of horrors for Derek Lowe. On Friday night, he threw six strong innings in the ballpark that has vexed so many visiting pitchers.	Lowe earned his first win in a month, Garrett Anderson and Diory Hernandez hit two-run doubles and the Atlanta Braves beat the Colorado Rockies 4-1.	Lowe entered the game 2-4 with a 6.23 ERA in nine starts in Denver, but he felt he was due for a strong outing in the Mile High air.	"I came in this time believing I could pitch a good game here," Lowe said. "To be able to pitch this well in a place I struggled and the way I had pitched the last five games in really important."	Lowe (8-7) was 0-4 in five starts since beating the Pittsburgh Pirates on June 9. He ended his personal skid with what he said was his best game all season. He gave up one run and four hits, struck out five and walked one. He left after a 52-minute rain delay that began at the end of the sixth inning.	"Derek Lowe was the No. 1 reason for us winning tonight," Braves manager Bobby Cox said. "He used that sinker an awful lot. He got groundballs and got some strikeouts, too. I think he's back to normal again."	Lowe's sinker got him out of trouble in the fifth when the Rockies had runners on first and second and no outs. Lowe got Carlos Gonzalez to ground into a double play and struck out pitcher Ubaldo Jimenez to end the threat.	"I had been killing myself over the past five starts thinking over what I had done," Lowe said. "So I thought zero mechanical stuff. I thought just to get the ball and throw it and keep it on the ground."	Lowe got all the support he needed in the first when Milton Prado and Chipper Jones had consecutive one-out singles, and one out later, Anderson knocked in both with a double to right-center.	"It was probably a little up, but wasn't that bad of a pitch," Jimenez said. "He was looking for my fastball and he sat on that pitch."	Todd Helton made it 2-1 with a 418-foot homer with two outs in the sixth, his 10th of the season. One out later, the game was delayed by rain, ending Lowe's night.	"I was bummed," Lowe said. "The way I was struggling it would have been really nice to keep going."	Anderson and Prado both had two hits for the Braves, who before the game traded right fielder Jeff Francoeur and cash to the New York Mets for outfielder Ryan Church.	Jimenez (6-9), who no-hit Arizona for 6 2/3 innings in his last outing, is 0-3 in his last four starts. He gave up two runs and six hits, struck out eight and walked one in six innings.	The Braves extended their lead in the eighth on Hernandez's two-out double that drove in Brian McCann and Matt Diaz.	The Rockies threatened in the bottom of the inning, but reliever Eric O'Flaherty struck out Helton and Hawpe with runners on second and third.	"O'Flaherty saved the day again," Cox said. "That was a huge turning point when he got the two big strikeouts."	The Rockies, who rallied three times Thursday to beat Atlanta, couldn't come up with the big hit Friday.	"We had opportunities to score runs and we came away empty," Rockies manager Jim Tracy said. "That was the difference in the game. They capitalized on a couple of pitches with runners in scoring position and we had opportunities to score runs tonight and they put us down."	The Rockies lost reliever Alan Embree for the season when he was hit by a line drive and fractured his right tibia.	Embree, who relieved Jimenez after the rain delay, was taken off the field on a cart after being struck by a line drive hit by Prado in the seventh. The Rockies said he will have surgery Saturday and is done for the year.	"It's tough to take when you see something like that happen," Tracy said.	Game notes	 Braves SS Yunel Escobar was out of the lineup Friday after straining his lower back in Thursday's game against Colorado. Cox said Escobar is day to day. ... Jones (sore groin) returned to the lineup after not starting the last three games. He didn't play Tuesday and Wednesday, but he came in as a pinch-hitter in the eighth inning Thursday.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

PHOENIX -- The Arizona Diamondbacks made a seven-run lead stand up this time.	One run would have been enough with All-Star Dan Haren on the mound.	Haren threw his second career shutout, and Felipe Lopez hit a three-run homer as the Diamondbacks routed the Florida Marlins 8-0 on Friday night.	One night after blowing a seven-run lead -- the biggest collapse in team history -- the Diamondbacks jumped to a 7-0 fourth-inning margin on Florida starter Ricky Nolasco (6-7), who lost for the first time since June 7.	Haren (9-5) made sure it wouldn't happen two nights in a row, tossing a four-hitter for his third complete game of the season and ninth of his career. Haren's other shutout came Sept. 16, 2008, against San Francisco.	"What a performance," Arizona manager A.J. Hinch said. "Obviously, a good offensive night for us, too. Really, just what we needed after getting hit in the mouth a little bit last night. It was a great rebound game for us."	Haren struck out 10 and walked one in a 117-pitch outing as the Diamondbacks won for the sixth time in seven games.	"That sets off the fire alarms around here when he walks a guy," Hinch said.	Haren, who whittled his NL-best ERA to 2.01, made a strong case to start the All-Star game in St. Louis next week. He's come a long way since losing his first three starts by scores of 3-0, 3-1 and 2-0.	"The way the year started, being 0-3, battling back and having nine wins by the [All-Star] break is nice," Haren said. "But more importantly, the team has won six out of the last seven or so and we're just playing better in general."	Haren kept the Marlins fishing with an array of cutters and fastballs. He was so dominant that Hanley Ramirez, whose .348 batting average leads the NL, did not get the ball out of the infield in four at-bats. Ramirez went 1-for-4 with an infield single.	"I had good stuff, and getting a lead early was also nice," Haren said. "That's not an easy lineup to go through, especially with Hanley in there."	Haren gave up a leadoff single to Chris Coghlan, then retired the next 11 batters. Ross Gload broke up the streak with a ground-rule double with two outs in the fourth, but Haren struck out Dan Uggla to end the threat.	Haren allowed two-out singles in the fifth and sixth, but gave up only a walk the rest of the way. He closed with a flourish, retiring the last nine batters. He struck out Uggla for the third time to end the game, bringing the Chase Field crowd of 21,307 to its feet.	"You've got to tip your hat to Danny because he was terrific," Florida manager Fredi Gonzalez said.	Nolasco had gone 4-0 in his last five starts, but he lacked command against the feeble-hitting Diamondbacks, who entered with a .245 team batting average, 15th in the NL.	The Diamondbacks took a 1-0 lead on Miguel Montero's fifth home run, to the right field seats, and they made it 2-0 on Stephen Drew's RBI triple in the third. Drew, who had been 1-for-13 against Nolasco, also had a double.	Arizona erupted for five runs in the third -- all with two outs.	Alex Romero's triple made it 3-0, and then Haren dribbled a 20-foot single down the third-base line to score Romero.	"That's about as lucky as you can get right there," said Haren, who is hitting .268 with five RBIs.	Lopez followed with a shot to the pool area in right-center field, his sixth.	"They put some good swings on the ball," said Nolasco, who went six innings, allowing seven runs on nine hits. He struck out eight and walked one.	Game notes	 Arizona 3B Mark Reynolds struck out twice to boost his majors-leading strikeout total to 119. ... Marlins SS Ramirez started for the first time in five games. Ramirez, voted to start the All-Star game, had been nursing a right hip flexor. ... Arizona RHP Tom Gordon, out with a strained left hamstring, pitched batting practice Friday and is scheduled to start a rehab stint at Single-A Visalia on Monday.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- With the heart of the order hurting, the Los Angeles Angels got power from Kendry Morales and an unexpected source.	Erick Aybar matched Morales' three-run homer and the Angels rallied to spoil Mark Teixeira's first appearance in Anaheim with a 10-6 victory over the New York Yankees on Friday night.	Teixeira, who left in the offseason to sign a free-agent deal with the Yankees, went 1 for 5 and stranded four runners. He was showered by boos throughout the game.	Aybar, one of the smallest players in the Angels' clubhouse at 5-foot-10, provided the spark for the Angels, who are missing Torii Hunter (adductor strain) and Vladimir Guerrero (strained muscle), who both went on the disabled list earlier in the day, and Juan Rivera because of injuries.	"You don't see Erick hit home runs very often, you don't see him miss one by a couple feet foul and then come back and hit one," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "Two good at-bats and we needed them."	Alex Rodriguez homered for the Yankees, who failed to extend their eight-game road winning streak despite taking a 4-0 lead in the second and fell out of a first-place tie in the AL East with the Boston Red Sox.	"We swung a notch above and got back into the game," Scioscia said.	Gary Matthews Jr. had an RBI single in the second for his 1,000th career hit, and Bobby Abreu drove in a run in the fifth to cut the Yankees' lead to 5-2. Morales then hit the first pitch he saw from Yankees starter Joba Chamberlain over the wall in center field for his 15th homer, tying the game at 5.	Chone Figgins' RBI triple in the sixth gave Los Angeles a 6-5 lead.	"How about that?" Matthews said. "I guess I only got 1,011 more to catch my dad. I should be about 46 by the time I get there."	Chamberlain, coming off one of his worst starts of the season where he gave up a career-high eight runs, allowed the run in the second before imploding in the fifth.	He pitched 4 1/3 innings and gave up five runs -- four earned -- and nine hits.	"It's frustrating. I'm letting my teammates down, so it's kind of embarrassing, too," Chamberlain said. "I'm doing everything I can between starts, going out every day and continuing to work my tail off to get better to help this team, and I'm not getting results. The last two starts is the best my stuff has been all year, which makes it even more frustrating."	Mike Napoli reached when shortstop Derek Jeter dropped a popup in the seventh and Jeff Mathis was walked by Brian Bruney. With two outs, Aybar connected to deep right to make it 10-6 with his third homer of the season.	"I've never seen it, and I doubt we'll ever see it again," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said of Jeter's error. "It's a first for me. I mean, he's so great on popups. I was completely shocked. They ended up scoring three runs, and it looks like we're out of the inning if we don't do that. I mean, that makes it a big difference going into the ninth inning."	Mark Melancon (0-1) took the loss for New York, with Jason Bulger (4-1) pitching an inning for the win.	Brian Fuentes struck out Jorge Posada with two runners on for his 25th save in 28 chances.	"We gave them extra outs. The extra outs killed us. When you're playing that team, you can only give them three outs an inning," Jeter said. "They took advantage of a couple of mistakes and scored a lot of runs. They're not going to beat themselves. They put pressure on the defense and they pitch well."	Angels starter Joe Saunders continued to struggle with his command, giving up the four early runs.	"I think it's a step forward for Joe. I liked his stuff," Scioscia said. "Hopefully he'll be able to fine tune it a little bit and have it be a little more effective next start."	Jeter, who was 4 for 5, hit the first pitch for a leadoff single in the first and Johnny Damon was walked after starting the at-bat with an 0-2 count.	Rodriguez hit a double to score both runners and Nick Swisher had an RBI single off Saunders, who gave up nine hits and five runs in five innings.	Damon drove in a run in the second, and Rodriguez hit his 15th homer in the fifth to make it 5-1.

SEATTLE -- Scott Feldman knew that if he just did his job Friday night his teammates would do theirs against the Seattle Mariners.	It worked out just as the Texas Rangers right-hander hoped. He allowed two runs in the first inning but worked into the seventh and the Rangers hit three home runs in the 6-4 victory.	Michael Young had the biggest homer, a three-run shot in the third inning that gave the Rangers a 4-2 lead.	"I saw Scott [after the first]. We both came up to the clubhouse and he said, 'OK, I'm going to bear down here. Hopefully, that's all they get," Young said. "It was fun playing behind him. He gets up there and competes and does everything he can to win a ballgame."	Hank Blalock hit his 18th homer, a solo shot in the second, and Nelson Cruz added a two-run shot in the eighth, his 21st.	Young and Blalock are a combined 23 of 57 (.404) against Seattle this season with four home runs and 10 RBIs in seven games.	Feldman (8-2) went 6 2/3 innings, allowing seven hits and two runs. He was 6-8 last season with a 5.29 ERA.	Frank Francisco worked the ninth to pick up his 15th save in 17 opportunities.	"I hated giving up two runs but I felt if I could keep it there, more times than not we're going to put up some runs," Feldman said. "I just focused on keeping them there and forgetting about that first inning."	He said Young's home run "turned the momentum our way. That was the hit of the night right there. I gave up the early lead and he got it right back for us."	Brandon Morrow (0-4) went five innings, allowing four runs and six hits. He has yielded six home runs in his last four starts.	Ken Griffey Jr. had three hits for the Mariners.	"The big thing for me was we had Feldman with 24 pitches in the first inning and allowed him to get 6 2/3 (innings)," Mariners manager Don Wakamatsu said. "Our strength is to be able to get pressure on that starter and get into the bullpen like anyone else."	Ichiro Suzuki, who had two hits to raise his major league-leading average to .362, opened the Seattle first with a single and he scored without a throw when Russell Branyan doubled into the gap in left-center gap.	Griffey reached on a fielder's choice and he scored from first when Franklin Gutierrez extended his hitting streak to a career-high 13 games with a double into the gap in right-center to make it 2-0.	The Rangers made it 2-1 in the second on Blalock's 435-foot homer, the 18th of his career against Seattle.	Texas took advantage of Morrow's control problems in a three-run third. Omar Vizquel and Ian Kinsler drew consecutive one-out walks followed by Young's first-pitch blast, his 11th, for a 4-2 lead.	"After I lost Vizquel, I just lost it against Kinsler and that got the second guy on," Morrow said. "Then Young came up and drove the ball pretty good."	The Rangers had an aggressive game plan against Morrow. Five batters swung at his first pitch, seven at his second and three went at his third offering. Fifteen of the 23 batters he faced only saw three pitches.	"We know what type of fastball he has. We're a fastball-hitting team," Rangers manager Ron Washington said. "When he throws something in the zone, we tried to get on it. That's what that was."	Young said there wasn't one way of how the Rangers would face Morrow.	"We try to make sure regardless of who we are facing, our approach is dictated by the situation of the game and what the scoreboard tells us to do. It's a case by case basis," Young said. "I was looking for something I could drive a little bit. First and second with one out, anything I roll over right there is going to be bad news, trying not to hit a double-play ball. I tried to hit something hard and hopefully find a gap."	Cruz's home run made it 6-2, but the Mariners scored two in the eighth on Gutierrez's RBI groundout and Kenji Johjima's RBI double.	Game notes	 OF David Murphy was scratched from the Texas lineup because of a strained finger on his right hand. He injured it Thursday trying to make a diving catch. He is day to day. ... Cruz, an All-Star, is considering participating in the Home Run Derby. Asked if he could match teammate Josh Hamilton's effort last year, he said: "Nobody can do better; nobody in this league." ... The Mariners decided against DH Mike Sweeney having an MRI on his ailing back. ... Griffey's eighth-inning double was his 515th, tying him with Joe Cronin for 38th place on the all-time list.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN FRANCISCO -- On a night when Jonathan Sanchez was nearly perfect, his father chose the perfect time to show up in San Francisco and cheer him.	The Giants left-hander threw the majors' first no-hitter of the season Friday night and came within a whisper of a perfect game. The only runner to reach against him in an 8-0 victory over the San Diego Padres came on an error by third baseman Juan Uribe with one out in the eighth.	Sanchez's dad, Sirgfredo, watched nervously from the stands, bouncing and biting his nails, then scurried down to the dugout to be among the first to congratulate the pitcher.	"Right now I'm just going to go home and hang out with my dad," Sanchez said. "I was pumped that he was here watching the game."	Sanchez almost lost his no-hit bid in the ninth, but Gold Glove center fielder Aaron Rowand saved the gem with a leaping grab at the center-field fence to rob pinch-hitter Edgar Gonzalez for the second out.	"I was going to go up and over and land on the other side of the fence if I had to, to try to make the catch," Rowand said.	The 26-year-old Sanchez (3-8) returned to the rotation after a nearly three-week demotion to the bullpen -- and only got the call because 303-game winner Randy Johnson went on the disabled list this week with a shoulder injury.	With his father and a friend cheering from the stands, Sanchez threw a called third strike past Everth Cabrera to finish his first career complete game. Sanchez walked toward the plate and thrust his arms in the air as catcher Eli Whiteside rushed in for a big hug and the Giants poured out of their dugout.	Also offering their congratulations were Johnson, the last major leaguer to throw a perfect game, and Giants pitching coach Dave Righetti, who tossed a no-hitter for the New York Yankees on July 4, 1983.	Sanchez's father is visiting from Puerto Rico and arrived in San Francisco on Thursday night. When the pitcher came off the field, the two shared a long embrace before Sanchez jogged back onto the field and tipped his cap to the cheering crowd.	"This is a gift for him," said Sanchez, who struck out a career-high 11. "I feel awesome."	It was the Giants' 13th no-hitter and first since John Montefusco did it on Sept. 29, 1976, at Atlanta. Their last one in San Francisco came when Ed Halicki beat the New York Mets in the second game of a doubleheader on Aug. 24, 1975.	The Padres were no-hit for the seventh time and first since Bud Smith blanked them 4-0 for St. Louis on Sept. 3, 2001.	Sanchez did it on 110 pitches, 77 for strikes. After the final one, Whiteside came rushing with a hug, followed moments later by all their teammates.	Sanchez, who won for the first time since May 25, had a five-start winless stretch this season in which he went 0-4. He told The Associated Press two days earlier that he hadn't lost his confidence in his ability to pitch and be a starter in the major leagues -- and manager Bruce Bochy hadn't lost faith, either.	"They gave me a second chance. You see what happened tonight," Sanchez said.	Sanchez wasn't blaming Uribe for the error that cost him a shot at a perfect game.	"It's the game. It can happen," Sanchez said. "I could have given up a hit, too. It doesn't matter. I just want to win."	Uribe wasn't part of the extended celebration in the Giants' clubhouse after the game. As is usually the case, he left quickly.	"I think tomorrow would be a better time to kid around with him," teammate Rich Aurilia said. "In the history of the game there are just so many perfect games. It may never occur again. I know it doesn't happen a lot."	There have been 15 perfect games in major league history. Johnson tossed the most recent one on May 18, 2004, for Arizona at Atlanta.	After the sixth inning, San Francisco manager Bruce Bochy removed third baseman Pablo Sandoval because of a sore back. He put Kevin Frandsen in at second and shifted Uribe from second to third.	Sanchez struck out the side in the seventh and Adrian Gonzalez hit a long drive to left in the eighth before Headley's grounder to Uribe, who finished with three hits and an RBI at the plate.	"He did everything to make that play," Aurilia said. "You have to remember he just moved over from second, where he'd been the last three weeks. That's not an easy hop. I know, I've played the position. Just think, he was one in-between hop away from a perfect game. We still saw something special tonight. Juan will contribute in the second half."	Sanchez pitched the first no-hitter in the majors since Carlos Zambrano for the Chicago Cubs against the Houston Astros in Milwaukee on Sept. 14, 2008. That game was relocated from Houston to Miller Park because of Hurricane Ike.	Sanchez's father and friend stood nervously -- with the rest of the crowd of 30,298 at AT&T Park on a cool night in the Bay Area -- and his dad couldn't look at the end. But Sanchez's dad quickly got down to the dugout to congratulate a pitcher who made his 51st major league start the most special of his career after months of struggles.	"Felicidades!" -- congratulations -- fans yelled in the tunnel outside the San Francisco clubhouse as Sanchez signed autographs.	Cabrera, the last batter of the game, squared to bunt on the first pitch -- bringing a chorus of boos from the crowd. Sanchez then froze Cabrera with a breaking ball, setting a career-high with his 11th strikeout. Cabrera protested the call, looking at plate umpire Brian Runge in disbelief.	"On film he throws the ball hard, but it looks like he doesn't know where it's going," San Diego's Tony Gwynn Jr. said. "Today he looked exactly like he knew where it was going."	Sanchez finished the Giants' major league-leading 13th shutout of the year, following All-Star and reigning NL Cy Young Award winner Tim Lincecum's no-hit bid into the seventh inning a night earlier against San Diego.	"I think if you looked at the staff, he wouldn't be the one you picked," Bochy said. "He came out throwing 94-96 [mph]. He just had incredible stuff."	The last no-hitter in San Francisco was pitched by Florida's Kevin Brown on June 10, 1997, at Candlestick Park -- so this was the first at the Giants' 10-year-old waterfront ballpark.	Sandoval hit a three-run homer to center off Josh Banks (1-1) in the fifth. Rowand also had three RBIs.	Uribe and Whiteside had RBI singles in a four-run second inning. Rowand added a two-run single.	Whiteside started in place of regular catcher Bengie Molina, whose wife went into labor Friday.	Game notes	 It was the first no-hitter by a Giants lefty since Hall of Famer Carl Hubbell pitched one for the New York Giants against Pittsburgh on May 8, 1929. ... A 27th-round draft pick in 2004, Sanchez pitched four no-hitters in college for NAIA Ohio Dominican.	Information from The Associated Press was used in this story.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- All that power in the Yankees' lineup couldn't overcome the Los Angeles Angels' pesky, grind-it-out offense in another comeback by the team that does them better than anyone else.	Mike Napoli hit a go-ahead two-run double off reliever David Robinson during a seven-run fifth inning and added a solo homer in the seventh, leading the Angels to a 14-8 victory on Saturday after the Yankees tied a season high with five home runs, including two from Alex Rodriguez.	The Angels have 24 runs in their first two games since outfielders Vladimir Guerrero and Torii Hunter went on the disabled list. Left fielder Juan Rivera also was unavailable after leaving Friday night's series opener because of tightness in his left quad and right hamstring.	"It's real positive because it shows everybody in the clubhouse that we can still put together runs without our three big boys in there," leadoff man Chone Figgins said. "It all goes back having good at-bats and putting runners on base. The more we get that train going, the better our offense works."	The Angels lead the majors with 26 comeback wins, one more than the Yankees. Brandon Wood, a perennial prospect recalled from Triple-A Salt Lake on Friday, hit a two-run homer during the fifth-inning rally and Howie Kendrick capped it with a two-run single. Former Yankees outfielder Bobby Abreu had three RBIs.	"The third, fourth and fifth innings is where we do our damage -- the second and third time through the lineup, when these guys can get a feel for the starting pitcher," starter Jered Weaver said. "People know they need to step up with our three leading hitters out, and they definitely have."	For the seventh time in the Angels' last eight games, they fell behind by at least four runs. And for the fourth time, they won -- including Friday night's 10-6 victory, when they overcame a 5-1 deficit against Joba Chamberlain. It's the first time they have won four games in this fashion on one homestand in the franchise's 49-year history.	"There's not many teams in the big leagues that can run first-to-third with us and continue to put that pressure on, so it's going to be tough on a team defensively," Figgins said. "So when we put runners on base and go first-to-third like we did, it sets up a lot of our offense and puts guys in better situations to hit."	Rodriguez increased his career total to 570 and putting him 10th on the career list ahead of former Texas Rangers teammate Rafael Palmeiro.	Robinson Cano extended the Yankees' margin to 4-0 in the fourth with a two-out RBI single. But the stubborn Angels pulled ahead 8-4 in the fifth while knocking out Andy Pettitte (8-5).	"They don't strike out a whole lot, they put the ball in play and they go first to third on everything," Pettitte said. "They play the game hard and they play it right."	Weaver (10-3) struck out nine over six innings, allowing four runs -- three earned -- and four hits, including Rodriguez's two-run homer in the first and Eric Hinske's solo shot in the second.	Hinske, starting for the second time in 11 games since the Yankees acquired him from Pittsburgh on June 30, added a two-run shot in the seventh off Darren Oliver. Hideki Matsui also homered, but the Yankees lost for the 16th time in their last 21 games at Angel Stadium after entering this series in a 13-2 roll.	Hinske came up in the eighth against Kevin Jepsen, after Jason Bulger surrendered back-to-back homers by Rodriguez and Matsui that cut the Angels' lead to 10-8. But he lined out to second with the potential tying run at the plate.	The Angels tacked on four more in the bottom half, including an RBI single by Kendry Morales that extended his career-best hitting streak to 15 games. The 14 runs were a season high for the Angels.	Pettitte allowed six runs on seven hits in 4 1/3 innings after allowing six runs last Monday.	"To tell the truth, I feel better right now than I've felt the whole season, as far as the command of my pitches and the way my fastball is sinking," Pettitte said. "I've just got to keep going out and keep pitching. It's not like I haven't gone through horrible stretches in my career."	Game notes	 A-Rod had his first multihomer game of the season. ... Hinske, the 2002 AL rookie of the year with Toronto, has three homers in nine at-bats with the Yankees -- two more than he hit in 106 at-bats this season with the Pirates. The multihomer game was the seventh of his career.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CHICAGO -- Ted Lilly called it a cool experience. Earning his 100th major league victory was a milestone that had him reflecting on his past, while his teammates joked with him about the future.	"It's pretty special. I was thinking today about the first one in New York against Oakland [2001]. Just getting that one I hadn't even been thinking about trying to get 99 more," Lilly said.	Lilly allowed just four hits in eight strong innings and the Cubs beat the first-place St. Louis Cardinals 5-2 Saturday to stop a three-game losing streak.	Lilly is 100-81 in his major league career that began in 1999. He has also pitched for the Expos, Yankees, Athletics and Blue Jays. Of his 100 wins, 41 have come in his 2½ seasons with Chicago.	"It's really a cool thing. And then you come into the clubhouse and talk to your buddies in there and they're telling you, 'You only got 200 more to go,'" Lilly said.	Lilly (9-6), the Cubs' lone selection to the All-Star game, walked one and struck out four in a 103-pitch outing and left with a 5-1 lead. The veteran left-hander was staked to an early 3-0 lead with Jeff Baker hitting a two-run, bases-loaded single in the first.	"He's been our best pitcher," Cubs manager Lou Piniella said. "He pitches into the ball game deep every game. He's a professional."	St. Louis got a run in the ninth off reliever Carlos Marmol and had the tying run at the plate before closer Kevin Gregg struck out pinch-hitter Skip Schumaker to end the game.	The Cubs trail the Cardinals by 3½ games. The teams will meet in a split doubleheader Sunday on the final day before the All-Star break.	"We'll see where we are after the second game tomorrow night. We could be 1½, 3½ or 5½ [out]. We'll find out," Piniella said.	Albert Pujols singled with one out in the ninth and Ryan Ludwick walked. Pinch-hitter Chris Duncan hit a chopper back to Marmol, who threw to second for the force but the relay was too late to complete the double play.	Yadier Molina then hit an RBI single to make it 5-2. After Marmol threw a wild pitch, Gregg relieved and struck out Schumaker to get his 16th save in 19 chances.	"We made three or four mistakes and they didn't miss them and that was the difference for them," Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said. "I just enjoyed watching us keep playing and having a legitimate shot there at the end. That's just my favorite part of the game."	The Cubs loaded the bases in the opening inning on two walks and Aramis Ramirez's single. Brad Thompson (2-6) then hit Milton Bradley with an 0-2 pitch with two outs to force in the first run before Baker lined a two-run single up the middle for a 3-0 lead.	"I had two outs in the first and it was ugly for me just getting the two outs, but I had 0-2 on Bradley and I hit him. There's just no excuse for that," Thompson said.	"That's ridiculous. And then Baker gets a big knock."	The Cards got a run back in the fourth on Ludwick's RBI double.	Ryan Theriot's single, a double by Derrek Lee and Ramirez's RBI grounder made it 4-1 in the fifth. Alfonso Soriano, who has been in one of the biggest slumps of his career with a .189 average over his previous 41 games, delivered an RBI single to make it a four-run lead and finish Thompson.	Thompson gave up five hits and five runs in 4 2/3 innings. He also walked three, threw a pair of wild pitches and hit a batter.	Baker, in his second start since being acquired from the Rockies on July 2, had a single, double and a walk and helped turn a nice double play in the seventh by bare-handing a flip from shortstop Theriot and firing to first.	Game notes	 Lee left the game after the bottom of the fifth with neck spasms. He has had problems with them in the past but said these weren't as bad. He expects to play Sunday. "Just a tweak, got out as a precaution," he said. ... Cardinals RHP Kyle Lohse is expected to come off the disabled list Sunday (forearm strain) and start the opener of the doubleheader. He's been on the DL since June 4. ... Bradley had nine putouts playing in sunny right field. He said the middle-of-the-afternoon start actually made it easier to see.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Rajai Davis and Adam Kennedy gave a tired Dallas Braden some offensive support.	Davis and Kennedy each hit two-run homers in the seventh inning, and Braden gave up two runs over six innings to help the Oakland Athletics beat the Tampa Bay Rays 7-2 on Saturday night.	Braden (7-7), reinstated from the bereavement list before the game to pitch for the first time since July 1, allowed five hits, two walks and struck out six. The left-hander, who had spent most of the past week with his ailing grandmother, is just 3-2 despite allowing two earned runs or less in each of his last eight starts.	"He looked a little fatigued at the beginning," A's manager Bob Geren said. "He had a long week and he came out and the game was his."	Braden acknowledged he "felt bad" early on.	"We won. That's the most important part," Braden said. "Was I happy with tonight? Not really, but I got through it."	Braden arrived in Florida around 11 p.m. Friday.	"When you don't sleep for four days and don't eat anything, it'll be brutal," Braden said. "I didn't pick up a ball until two days ago."	Davis hit his two-run homer off Matt Garza (6-7) before Kennedy added another two-run shot on the only pitch Randy Choate threw to put Oakland ahead 4-2.	Garza allowed three runs and seven hits in 6 1/3 innings as Tampa Bay's nine-game home winning streak ended.	"I made one mistake and paid for it," Garza said.	Mark Ellis had a sacrifice fly and Orlando Cabrera drove in two with a double in the eighth that extended the Athletics' advantage to 7-2. Oakland won for just fifth time in 16 games.	Gabe Kapler gave Tampa Bay a 1-0 lead on an RBI single in the second. Ben Zobrist made it 2-0 with a sixth-inning run-scoring single.	"It just got away from us," Tampa Bay manager Joe Maddon said. "It shouldn't, but it did."	Davis replaced right fielder Ryan Sweeney in third.	"He popped a ball up and I didn't like the way he ran down the line," Geren said of Sweeney. "Sometimes players take their frustrations out different ways. He didn't run down the line. He's never made that mistake before and I'm sure after today we won't again."	Oakland loaded the bases with two outs in the first, but failed to score when Garza retired Kurt Suzuki for his third strikeout of the inning. The right-hander struck out seven and walked one.	Athletics first baseman Jason Giambi left in the fifth with a bruised right elbow, and is day to day. He was hit on the elbow by a pitch during the second.	Tampa Bay catcher Dioner Navarro departed in the seventh after he was hit on the side the mask on Jack Cust's foul tip. He needed assistance to walk off the field.	Navarro was scheduled to undergo tests at a hospital to see if he has a concussion.	"He was woozy and not feeling well," Maddon said.	Maddon was ejected in the ninth by plate umpire Jeff Nelson for arguing what was called an error on Michel Hernandez, who had tried to pick a ball up with his mask after stopping a low pitch.	Hernandez was first charged with a catcher's balk, but that ruling was changed by the official scorer to an error after the game.	Maddon, after watching a replay, said Nelson's call that let a baserunner advance one base on the play was correct.	Game notes	 Maddon said his post-All-Star game rotation will be: RHP James Shields, LHP Scott Kazmir, Garza, LHP David Price and RHP Jeff Niemann. ... Oakland manager Bob Geren said Nomar Garciaparra will start playing around one game a series at first base. The move will allow Giambi to get additional time off. ... Tampa Bay C Shawn Riggans (right shoulder) could play in a minor league in the next few days. ... To make room on the roster for Braden, RHP Jeff Gray was optioned to Triple-A Sacramento.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BALTIMORE -- Melvin Mora's rare stroll around the bases ended with a slide at the plate into the waiting arms of his elated teammates.	Mora ended a 50-game homerless drought with an opposite-field drive in the 12th inning Saturday night, giving the Baltimore Orioles a 4-3 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays.	"It's a good feeling, especially when you win the game," said Mora, whose previous longest stretch without a homer was 43 games.	Mora had gone 189 at-bats without connecting before getting hold of a pitch from Jesse Carlson (1-4) and sending it into the front row of the right-field bleachers. It was his third homer of the season, the first since May 7.	Orioles manager Dave Trembley, who watched from a stadium suite while closing out a two-game suspension stemming from his ejection earlier in the week, cheered as Mora rounded the bases.	"Melvin picked a good time to get one, didn't he?" Trembley said. "Everybody dreams of that -- a walk-off and win the game at home in extra innings. That's a special moment."	Mora thought he ended the dry spell with a fourth-inning swing, but his liner to center died near the warning track.	"I think the one I hit before, that was gone. So I was like OK, I'm going to hit another one and see what happens," he said. "And that one, I don't know, I thought it was going to hit the wall because I hit the other one better."	Luke Scott also homered for Baltimore to extend his hitting streak to a career-high 11 games. Mark Hendrickson (5-4), the sixth Orioles pitcher, worked the 12th.	Toronto got the potential go-ahead run to third base with one out in the 11th after Baltimore catcher Matt Wieters dropped the ball in a botched rundown. But Brian Bass worked out of trouble by striking out pinch-hitter Lyle Overbay and retiring Rod Barajas on a sharp grounder to third that bounced off Mora's chest.	Brian Butterfield, who ran the team while Cito Gaston attended the funeral of his sister, said, "We had a lot of opportunities. They've battled the entire [2-7] road trip. We're just not coming out on the right end of the stick."	Aaron Hill had two hits and drove in a run for the Blue Jays, who have lost 11 of 14 despite opening the three-game series with a 2-0 victory.	Baltimore used successive doubles by Nick Markakis and Aubrey Huff to go up 3-2 in the sixth, but Toronto tied it in the eighth. After Jim Johnson hit Marco Scutaro with a pitch, Adam Lind singled and Scott Rolen hit a sacrifice fly.	Bidding to become the first Blue Jays rookie to win eight games before the All-Star break, Toronto starter Ricky Romero left with the score tied after giving up three runs and seven hits in eight innings. Despite getting a no-decision, he reached the midpoint with a 7-3 record.	"I'm pretty happy about it," Romero said. "You can't complain when things are going your way. The hard work has paid off. I still have a whole lot of second half to prepare for."	Rich Hill allowed two runs and seven hits in six-plus innings for the Orioles after yielding a total of 21 runs and 23 hits in his previous three starts. Hill was given the starting assignment after a virus forced Jeremy Guthrie out of the rotation.	The Orioles got a second-inning run when Wieters received credit for an RBI double on a two-out popup that glanced off the glove of charging Toronto center fielder Vernon Wells.	Scott made it 2-0 in the fourth with his team-high 18th homer, a drive to right that landed on Eutaw Street in front of the B&O Warehouse. Only 51 balls have landed on Eutaw Street in the 18-year history of Camden Yards, and Scott has hit three of them.	Toronto was 0 for 6 with runners in scoring position until Scutaro doubled in a run with two outs in the fifth and scored the tying run on a single by Aaron Hill. The uprising started when former Oriole Kevin Millar snapped a 14 for 80 skid with a leadoff double.	Game notes	 Mired in a 3 for 32 slump, Baltimore rookie Nolan Reimold was given the day off. ... Aaron Hill has 36 multihit games, second in the AL behind Ichiro Suzuki. ... Toronto has doubled in 19 consecutive games.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

DETROIT -- Carl Pavano knew he wasn't at his best in the first few innings Saturday night.	His teammates kept him in the game until he got rolling.	Pavano took advantage of three early double plays and three early runs and helped the Cleveland Indians beat the Detroit Tigers 5-4.	"When things go your way early in a game, you can build some momentum," said Pavano, who allowed seven hits with six strikeouts and no walks. "I got some runs and the guys made some great plays behind me, and I was able to go from there."	Pavano didn't allow a run after the second inning, but needed some help to get out of the third. The Tigers had runners on first and third with one out when Clete Thomas took off with Ryan Raburn at the plate.	Raburn struck out, and second baseman Asdrubal Cabrera cut off Victor Martinez's throw to second in order to catch Marcus Thames trying for a delayed steal of home.	"I saw Thomas going, so I threw to second," Martinez said. "Asdrubal made a great play -- he saw what was happening and did the right thing."	Pavano left after eight innings with a three-run lead, but Kerry Wood gave up a two-run homer to Miguel Cabrera before retiring the next three batters for his 12th save.	"Kerry did a great job of righting himself," Cleveland manager Eric Wedge said. "He walked a guy and then he gives up a homer to one of the best hitters in the league, but then he settled down and got the next three guys. That's good to see."	Cleveland won for just the seventh time in 25 games, while the Tigers had their three-game winning streak snapped.	"That was some good baseball out there -- that's one of the best all-around games we've played this season," Wedge said. "We pitched well, we made some nice plays, and we hit the ball well."	Armando Galarraga (5-8) took the loss, his first since June 13. He gave up four runs and nine hits in six-plus innings.	Cleveland took a 1-0 lead in the first on a pair of singles before a sacrifice fly by Martinez, but Detroit took a 2-1 advantage in the second on Raburn's RBI triple and a run-scoring single by Brandon Inge.	The Indians, though, took the lead for good with a two-out rally in the third. Grady Sizemore tripled, and after walks to Martinez and Shin-Soo Choo loaded the bases, Hafner hit a two-run single.	Tigers manager Jim Leyland was frustrated by Galarraga's performance in the inning.	"He may have cost himself the game, because he got two quick outs and then he pitched like a solo home run was going to win the game," he said. "It's the third inning, and you walk two guys -- there's no excuse for that. You can't pitch like that up here. It won't work."	Cleveland added an insurance run in the seventh on Cabrera's RBI single, and another in the eighth on doubles by Choo and Jhonny Peralta.	Game notes	 Detroit OF Carlos Guillen, sidelined since May 5 with a shoulder injury, will begin a rehab assignment Monday with Class A Lakeland. ... As part of Negro Leagues Weekend, the Tigers wore uniforms based on the 1919 Detroit Stars, while the Indians were dressed as the 1948 Cleveland Buckeyes. Those teams never faced each other, as the Stars had folded several years before the Buckeyes were formed. ... Cleveland had lost six straight to Detroit, with their only other win this season coming May 1. In both games, Pavano beat Galarraga at Comerica Park with Wood getting a save.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

MILWAUKEE -- Fill-in starter Mike Burns looked tired and shaky, giving up long back-to-back home runs that cut a four-run lead to one when Manny Ramirez dug in at the plate.	"It is dangerous," Burns said. "You're looking at one pitch from a tie ballgame."	Instead, Ramirez popped out Burns' final pitch to end the fifth, and Trevor Hoffman and the bullpen held on after squandering one-run leads in each of the previous two nights as the Milwaukee Brewers beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 6-3 on Saturday.	Hoffman pitched a perfect ninth to cap four scoreless innings, and J.J. Hardy hit a two-out, two-run double in the eighth for breathing room.	"To the team and fan base when the bullpen falters a little bit, it can be a bit of a shock," said Seth McClung, who allowed the only two hits by the group over two innings. "We're the same guys that got our butts kicked yesterday, but we're also the same guys that have been consistently good all year."	Burns (2-2) struck out a career-high seven and drove in a run to win for the second time in his career while in the rotation for the injured Dave Bush (triceps). But he needed the help of McClung, Todd Coffey and Hoffman, who blew a save chance for just the second time this season the night before in a 12-8 extra innings loss.	Frank Catalanotto homered for the Brewers, losers of seven of 10 and two games behind St. Louis in the NL Central.	"We haven't had much luck lately, and we haven't played that well either," said Catalanotto, who hit his first homer since April 22, 2008. "Especially after last night's loss, it was big to come back and win this one today."	Rafael Furcal and Andre Ethier hit back-to-back shots for the Dodgers (55-32), who are 5-3 on their nine-game trip and will have the best mark in the majors at the All-Star break regardless of what happens Sunday.	"We put pressure on them when we got close, but that's as close as we got," Dodgers manager Joe Torre said.	On Saturday night, Coffey struck out the side in the eighth with Milwaukee leading 4-3 and Hardy came through in the bottom of the inning.	Hardy's double off Guillermo Mota drove in Prince Fielder, who went 2 for 3 and had an RBI single in the first, and Mike Cameron to provide room for Hoffman. The career saves leader had a 1-2-3 ninth to notch his 20th this year and 574th of his career.	"When the lead was cut to one, every pitch is important then," Brewers manager Ken Macha said. "That's why that double for J.J. in the bottom of the eighth was big."	The RBI single by Burns proved to be the one Milwaukee needed most after Dodgers starter Jeff Weaver (5-3) allowed four straight hits to start the fourth.	With Milwaukee leading 2-0, Catalanotto led off with a homer to right field. Hardy tripled and scored when Burns singled to make it 4-0. Burns was thrown out by Ramirez trying to stretch the single into a double.	"I played with Manny in Boston and sometimes he'll want to go after a ball and cut it off and sometimes he'll take it easy, despite me being terribly slow, he got to that ball pretty quick and made a great play," Burns said.	An error by Furcal at short cost Weaver two unearned runs in the first. Craig Counsell tripled, but was caught between third and home after Ryan Braun's sharply hit grounder. Furcal's throw to the plate went through the legs of Russell Martin, allowing Counsell to score and Braun to take second. Fielder made it 2-0 with his single.	"It was a tough play. It was a little low, the throw," Furcal said. "I tried to make it happen and it didn't work."	Los Angeles answered in the fifth.	After Matt Kemp singled, Furcal homered with two outs and Ethier hit his second homer in as many nights to make it 4-3, but Burns got out of the inning by forcing Ramirez to pop up.	Ramirez went 1 for 4 to extend his hitting streak to five games a night after tying Yankees great Mickey Mantle on the career home run list at 536. He is 8 of 26 with three homers, nine RBIs and six runs in eight games since returning from his 50-game drug suspension.	Game notes	 For every homer Fielder hits in the home run derby on Monday, the Brewers will knock a $1 off the $28 ticket price for Loge Outfield seats between Aug. 11-13 against San Diego. If Fielder hits 28, the tickets will be free. ... The Dodgers will likely use LHP Randy Wolf on Thursday and RHP Chad Billingsley on Friday against Houston after the break. Milwaukee plans to use RHP Braden Looper on Thursday and RHP Jeff Suppan on Friday at Cincinnati. Dodgers closer Jonathan Broxton (toe) likely will have to skip his first All-Star game on Tuesday because of his injury.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

HOUSTON -- Adam Dunn bristled when asked about his baserunning mistake after the Washington Nationals' 13-2 win over the Houston Astros on Saturday.	And why not? He and the Nationals don't get many chances to celebrate victories like this.	"Hey, we won and that was a lot of fun," Dunn said. "Lot of hits, lot of runs. Next?"	Nick Johnson, Josh Willingham and Dunn homered in consecutive at-bats and the Nationals set season highs for hits and runs. Washington had three straight shots for the first time since the franchise relocated from Montreal in 2005 and the 21 hits were the most since the move.	The Nationals reached 13 runs for the first time since a 13-5 win over the Chicago Cubs on Aug. 22, 2008.	But the way Washington's season has gone, manager Manny Acta wasn't ready to exhale until about the eighth inning.	"This is not hockey or basketball," he said. "There's no 24-second clock and every comeback has been done in baseball. Not until you get to the eighth inning and you're up by, let's say, 10 runs, do you try to feel a little bit comfortable."	The run support helped rookie starter Craig Stammen relax long before that.	Stammen (2-4) gave up nine hits in his first complete game and Washington's fourth this season. He threw only 107 pitches, taking more chances with Houston's hitters because of the lopsided score.	"The game's not on the line, so each pitch isn't make-or-break," Stammen said. "It actually makes you make better pitches."	Willingham added a two-run homer and an RBI double and Alberto Gonzalez had a pair of RBI singles for the Nationals.	Houston starter Mike Hampton (5-6) gave up nine hits in 3 2/3 innings, his shortest outing of the season. He pored over a video replay of his performance and didn't think he pitched that poorly.	"I thought I must've thrown a lot of balls up in the zone," Hampton said. "That just wasn't the case. Sometimes, you've just got to tip your hat to the other team."	The Nationals joined the New York Yankees as the only teams to homer in three straight at-bats this season. Nick Swisher, Robinson Cano and Melky Cabrera homered in consecutive at-bats against Baltimore at Yankee Stadium on May 20.	Hampton had won three of his last five starts, but the Nationals jumped on him from the first inning.	Nyjer Morgan led off with a single and scored on Willingham's two-out double. Willingham scored on Dunn's single, just the second time in six outings that Hampton had allowed more than one run.	Dunn came home on Josh Bard's double, but Astros shortstop Miguel Tejada told Hampton that Dunn didn't step on second base. Hampton threw to Tejada to appeal and second-base umpire Jim Wolf called Dunn out.	A mistake like that might've cost the Nationals in most games, the way their season has gone. But the offensive outburst made it a footnote.	"Obviously, we should've had one more run," Dunn said. "But we've had chances to break open games a bunch and tonight, we finally did it."	Michael Bourn scored runs in the first and third innings to tie it, but the Nationals opened the fourth inning with three straight singles to retake the lead.	Morgan drove in a run with a sacrifice fly and Cristian Guzman tacked on an RBI single to put the Nationals ahead 5-2.	Paulino relieved and gave up a bases-loaded single to Ronnie Belliard in the fifth.	In the sixth, Paulino struck out Guzman before Johnson drove a 2-2 pitch into the right-field seats, just out of the reach of Hunter Pence. Willingham homered to left on Paulino's next pitch, and Dunn worked a 3-2 count before hitting his homer.	"Tough night at the ballyard," said Houston manager Cecil Cooper. "We got a lot of pitches up and they didn't miss many."	Gonzalez and Stammen started the seventh inning with back-to-back doubles off Jeff Fulchino to make it 10-2. Johnson drove in Stammen with a single before Willingham hit a home run to left for his third multihomer game this season.	Game notes	 Bourn stole a career-high three bases to raise his NL-leading total to 32. ... Willingham has a 10-game hitting streak. ... Nationals 3B Ryan Zimmerman rejoined the team after attending his grandmother's funeral in North Carolina early Saturday.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PHILADELPHIA -- Ryan Howard's tying homer in the ninth helped the Phillies complete a memorable comeback.	Paul Bako's single gave Philadelphia an 8-7 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Saturday night, giving them wins in eight of their past nine games.	"That was one of the best wins of the year," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said.	The Phillies trailed 7-3 before pinch-hitter Matt Stairs led off the ninth with a homer off Matt Capps (1-5). Jimmy Rollins walked and stole second, his third steal of the game, and Chase Utley followed with a one-out single to left.	Howard followed Utley by blasting a 1-0 pitch to tie the game at 7. Raul Ibanez, playing in his first game after missing 20 with a groin injury, then hit a ground-rule double to center. After an intentional walk to Jayson Werth and an infield single by Pedro Feliz, Bako lined a 2-2 pitch to left, sending a crowd that included Vice President Joe Biden home happy.	"We were able to go out there, put it together and pull it out," Howard said.	Tyler Walker (1-0) pitched one scoreless inning of relief.	Pittsburgh starter Ross Ohlendorf held the Phillies to five hits while allowing three runs and striking out five. The right-hander matched his career high with four walks.	"There's no excuses. It's all me," Capps said. "I stunk. That was embarrassing."	Garrett Jones, Delwyn Young and Andrew McCutchen homered and drove in two runs for Pittsburgh, which lost for the eighth time in 10 games. Ryan Doumit, playing in his second straight game after returning from a broken right wrist he got April 19, went 2 for 5 with a pair of doubles and an RBI for the Pirates. Andy LaRoche went 2 for 4 with a double and triple and Jones had a pair of hits for Pittsburgh.	Cole Hamels, the 2008 World Series MVP, lasted six innings while allowing five runs on seven hits -- all extra-base hits. The left-hander has allowed at least seven hits in six of his last seven starts and is 1/3 in that stretch.	"It was one of those things I really felt like I was able to hit my spots; unfortunately they were able to hit them," Hamels said. "Wins are the ultimate goal and to be able to come away with a win makes me feel a little better."	Jones' solo homer to deep right and Young's two-run blast to deep left-center put Pittsburgh up 3-0 after one inning. The Pirates added two more in the second on McCutchen's two-run shot to left for a 5-0 lead.	The Phillies managed just two hits through five innings before the sixth, when they scored three runs on four hits. Ibanez had an RBI double and Greg Dobbs drove in a run with a sacrifice fly.	Pittsburgh added two runs in the seventh on a single hit to make it 7-3. Jack Wilson reached on Jones' bases-loaded walk and McCutchen scored on Doumit's groundout.	Wilson, Pittsburgh's shortstop, robbed Shane Victorino of a hit with a sliding over-the-head catch and then hopping up to double off Rollins at first.	Game notes	 Biden sat in the first row behind the plate, wearing a Phillies cap. ... Philadelphia C Carlos Ruiz missed his second straight game with neck stiffness. ... Utley was hit by a pitch for the NL-leading 13th time this season.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BOSTON -- John Smoltz finally felt as if he contributed to the Boston Red Sox. He doesn't expect it to be for the last time.	Smoltz got his first win for Boston and Kevin Youkilis hit two home runs to lift the Red Sox over the Kansas City Royals 15-9 Saturday night.	"I feel like I've checked in," Smoltz said. "It has been a long time, but this is not a feel-good story. I believe this team will be in position to win every time I go out there and the best is yet to come."	Smoltz (1-2) struck out seven over five innings, allowing one run on four hits. He struck out four batters in a row over the second and third inning capped off by called third strikes that painted the corner on Miguel Olivo and Tony Pena.	Coming off shoulder surgery that cut his 2008 season to six appearances, the 42-year-old Smoltz didn't make his first start until June 25 against Washington. He struggled with an 0-2 record and 6.60 ERA in three previous appearances.	"If you told me seven or eight years ago that I'd be helping John Smoltz get a win, I probably wouldn't believe you. That was awesome," Red Sox reliever Daniel Bard said.	Gil Meche (4-9) left with two outs in the fourth inning with back spasms after he had allowed seven runs -- five earned.	"Stuff-wise I thought I had great stuff," Meche said. "After the second pitch to Pedroia in the fourth inning I felt a twinge in my lower back and it was a bad muscle spasm. It's a good thing the All-Star break is here."	Jason Varitek and David Ortiz also homered for Boston while Youkilis, who had been in a 3 for 30 slump, drove in four runs and scored four as well.	The only real trouble for Smoltz came in the fourth inning after he gave up back-to-back singles to Billy Butler and Mark Teahen, but he retired the next three batters.	"You sit here for four starts hearing me say that it's going to happen, but people want to see it," Smoltz said. "The patience they have had with me is vital to what I believe is going to be a very successful run."	The Red Sox scored three in the first and took advantage of four Kansas City blunders.	David DeJesus misplayed Dustin Pedroia's triple, then Tony Pena misplayed Jason Bay's grounder and failed to force out Ortiz at second allowing Youkilis to score and Ortiz to advance to third. Jacoby Ellsbury then hit a deep fly to left and Jose Guillen thought it was the final out and initially began running in before remembering that Ortiz was tagging up at third. Catcher Olivo made the final mistake when he was charged with a throwing error.	Youkilis' two-run homer capped a three-run second before Varitek tied his 2008 output with his 13th home run to make it 7-0 after three.	"It's just one of those nights where we had to keep battling," Youkilis said. "You're going to have times where the hitting is better than the pitching, but we need our pitching to be better than our hitting over the long haul."	Meche struck out six. Since a four-hit shutout against Arizona on June 16, he is 0-4 with a 8.39 ERA in five starts.	Ortiz increased Boston's lead to 9-0 when hit a two-run homer off reliever Ron Mahay, who then retired seven straight.	Even with a 9-1 lead, things got dicey for Boston in the sixth when Justin Masterson allowed five straight batters to reach and gave up a two-run shot to Mike Jacobs.	Manny Delcarmen replaced Masterson and promptly walked DeJesus to load the bases. Ryan Freel followed with a flare to right that J.D. Drew played on the short hop before firing a strike to Varitek to get Olivo for a rare 9-2 force out.	"Bad read -- He's going back to tag up on a low line drive. You can't go back and tag. ... You're not going to score," Royals manager Trey Hillman said. "It's not a read the third base coach can make for you."	Billy Butler singled in two more runs to cut Boston's lead to 9-6 before Hideki Okajima ended the inning with another strikeout of Teahen.	Guillen led off the seventh with a solo shot to pull the Royals to 9-7 and then Okajima gave up a pair of singles before being replaced by Bard, who had retired 19 straight coming in. He struck out Olivo and pinch-hitter Brayan Pena before getting DeJesus to ground out.	Boston batted around in the seventh and eighth adding three runs in each, highlighted by Youkilis' second home run of the game and 16th of the season with a solo shot sandwiched around two unearned runs by K.C. off Bard.	Game notes	 Meche recorded his 1,000th career strikeout when he struck out Bay in the third. ... Ortiz recorded his 1,000th hit for Boston when he homered in the fourth. ... Smoltz made 708 appearances and won 210 games for Atlanta. ... Hillman was ejected after the seventh inning by home plate umpire Todd Tichenor. ... Masterson has allowed 12 runs over his last six innings.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MINNEAPOLIS -- The Twins made Ozzie Guillen antsy again.	After Minnesota scored a run in the seventh, a run in the eighth, two more in the ninth and put the winning run on first base, though, the rally fell one short.	Only then could Chicago's motormouth manager relax and enjoy a win fueled by a well-balanced lineup.	Jim Thome drove in four runs for the White Sox, countering two home runs by ex-teammate Joe Crede in an 8-7 victory on Saturday night.	"I wish somebody else would give those guys credit, not just me, because I sound like I'm pulling for them," Guillen said. "They show up every day."	Bobby Jenks picked up his 20th save, nearly blowing it when Jose Morales hit a two-run single with one out in the ninth after Crede's sharp grounder shot through Gordon Beckham's legs for an error to put runners at second and third. Denard Span grounded into a double play to end the game.	"I still had a good feeling," Beckham said. "I didn't think we were going to give one up. I have a lot of confidence that we'll get out of that situation."	Crede hit a three-run shot in the fifth inning and a solo homer in the seventh against Gavin Floyd (7-6), giving him four home runs in eight games against the White Sox this season. Beckham and Brian Anderson combined for five hits and two walks in the last two spots in the lineup, though, and helped keep Glen Perkins (4-5) from getting out of the fifth.	The Twins aren't generating any offense from the bottom of their batting order, one reason why they haven't climbed much higher than the .500 mark this year. No. 9 hitter Nick Punto is in a 3-for-30 slump.	"I felt like I was pretty locked in. I went with the flow and we scored a lot of runs today, which helps a lot," said Floyd, who turned it over to Jenks for the last out of the eighth. "I felt good about it."	Floyd got AL batting leader Joe Mauer to ground out to second base all four times he batted, including an inning-ending double play in the fourth. Crede's blast cut the lead to 5-3, but Floyd bounced back with a 1-2-3 sixth inning, pounding his glove in satisfaction after striking out Justin Morneau to retire the side.	Floyd struck out seven without a walk, his margin for error expanded when Thome's two-out, broken-bat bloop double bounced between Span and Carlos Gomez in left-center and stretched the lead to 8-3 in the sixth.	Perkins was supposed to start on Wednesday, but he woke up that morning with a high fever and badly sore throat that took away his appetite and was pushed back in the rotation by three days -- giving him nine days of rest between starts.	His velocity was down.	His pitches were up.	"It had nothing to do with stamina," manager Ron Gardenhire said.	Perkins gave up eight hits in 4 1/3 innings, the fourth Twins starter in the last five turns who failed to finish the sixth.	"I felt fine enough to pitch, and that's all that matters," he said.	The Twins, who fell to 2-5 against the White Sox this season, dropped back to that old .500 mark.	"Win eight out of 10, something like that," said right fielder Michael Cuddyer. "Yeah, we want to do that. We need to do that. We feel like we can do that, and it's frustrating that we haven't."	Game notes	 The Twins added a former scouting director, the late George Brophy, and a nine-time opening day starter, Brad Radke, to their Hall of Fame before the game. Radke remains an example for the pitching staff, three years after his retirement. "There's a lot of good tough stories in baseball, guys playing hurt and all this stuff, but pitching with a broken shoulder probably tops the list," said Gardenhire. Said Radke: "Must've done something right, not just throwing the ball over the plate, but helping other players." ... Guillen said White Sox general manager Kenny Williams won't be deterred by salary from making a trade. "If we get there and we need a piece to get this thing better, I think Kenny will do it." Guillen also said he believes this year's team is better than the 2008 division champions. "Because we can win a little different ways," he said.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

NEW YORK -- Jeff Francoeur's name was misspelled when the lineup was posted outside the New York Mets' clubhouse. A few fans at Citi Field encouraged him to go back to Atlanta. A baserunning blunder led to some razzing in the dugout.	Francoeur laughed off all of it. Just one night in and the 25-year-old slugger was well on his way to a fresh start in the Big Apple.	Francoeur had a two-run single in his Mets debut and Johan Santana pitched seven sharp innings, leading New York to a 4-0 victory over the Cincinnati Reds on Saturday.	"It was awesome," Francoeur said with a wide grin. "Probably, it was even cool for me to have Santana throwing the first night you're here, coming in with an energized crowd. The place was packed and that's something as a player you thrive on."	Omir Santos had three hits for New York, which scored all its runs in the first two innings. Leadoff hitter Angel Pagan scored twice and swiped two bases in his second game back after being sidelined with a strained groin.	"Things really worked out well for us there early," manager Jerry Manuel said. "Pagan kind of set the table for us."	Santana (10-7) allowed five hits, struck out five and walked one, taking advantage of some rare run support. New York scored seven runs in the left-hander's previous five starts.	While the Mets were all smiles, the Reds had a rough night. Johnny Cueto (8-6) turned in another shaky start, and right fielder Jay Bruce broke his right wrist trying to make a sliding catch.	"It seems like we get one guy back and then we lose another guy," manager Dusty Baker said. "I don't know what to say. I think we are being tested. We got to keep pushing and keep playing."	Francoeur got a warm greeting when he came to the plate with one out and the bases loaded in the first inning. The Mets acquired the free-swinging slugger and cash from the Braves on Friday for Ryan Church in a swap of outfielders.	Francoeur responded with a well-placed blooper over the head of first baseman Joey Votto, driving in Pagan and Luis Castillo. After Daniel Murphy walked, Santos singled to center to give the Mets a 3-0 lead.	"To be able to dump that one in the first inning felt good," Francoeur said. "Last thing I want to do is roll over my first pitch into a double play to end the inning."	Francoeur also singled in the seventh and was caught stealing by reliever Carlos Fisher, leading to some good-natured barbs when he returned to the dugout.	"Put it this way," he said. "I haven't ran too much in Atlanta and it's something I'm going to work on with them."	"I loved my time in Atlanta," Francoeur said. "It's where I	was from. But at the same time I feel I needed a change and this is	something that's going to, I think, fit real well."	Francoeur had received a raft of phone calls and text messages after he was traded to the Mets, including some advice from former New York left-hander Tom Glavine.	"He just told me, 'Make the most of it. If you play hard, you	hustle, you do the things right up here, the fans will love you,"'	Francoeur said. "I like to believe I'm kind of that type of	player, where I love to play hard. I love to get dirty and play the	game the right way."	Cueto gave up four runs and nine hits over five innings, dropping to 2/3 with a 7.31 ERA in his last six starts. It was the right-hander's first game since he allowed a career-high nine runs while recording just two outs in a 22-1 loss at Philadelphia.	"I had a little difficulty out there," he said. "I wasn't locating my pitches the way you're supposed to."	Bruce went down when he rushed in trying to grab David Wright's blooper in the first inning. He got his glove on the ball, but it came out as his wrist folded back awkwardly.	Bruce grabbed at his arm, and Baker and a trainer came out of the dugout after Wright's hit loaded the bases with no outs. The crowd groaned as the replay was shown on TVs around the ballpark.	"I knew it wasn't in good shape when I got up," said Bruce, who was wearing a cast in the clubhouse after the game. "It hurt pretty bad. I was in pretty bad pain but you know it's part of the game I guess. Trying to make the play."	Bruce will fly back to Cincinnati on Sunday to be examined. Chris Dickerson replaced him in right.	The Reds put two runners on in the first and seventh but Santana kept them from scoring.	"I felt good. I was throwing my two-seamers and my changeup pretty good," said Santana, who earned career win No. 119 to pass Freddy Garcia for most wins by a Venezuelan pitcher.	Pedro Feliciano worked the eighth and Francisco Rodriguez finished the six-hitter.	Cincinnati was shut out for the third time this season and has lost three of four overall.	Game notes	 The Mets haven't homered in 74 innings since Fernando Tatis went deep in the sixth at Pittsburgh on July 2. ... New York optioned OF Nick Evans to Triple-A Buffalo and signed INF Angel Berroa to a minor league contract. Berroa was assigned to Buffalo. ...

DENVER -- After not getting a lot of run support in his recent outings, Jair Jurrjens took care of things himself.	Jurrjens pitched six strong innings and singled twice for his first career multihit game to drive in a run and score another, leading the Atlanta Braves past the Colorado Rockies 4-3 on Saturday night.	"Any time you have a chance to help yourself out, you want to at least make the pitcher work," Jurrjens said. "Don't be an easy out. Don't just go up there swinging. Have an idea of what you're trying to do. I know can't get a hit every time, but I can make the other pitcher work every time and waste more pitches and that also helps my teammates by showing them what the other pitcher is trying to do."	Jurrjens (7-7) won for just the second time in his last eight starts. He had taken five losses in that span, including four in which he received two or fewer runs in offensive support.	"He could easily have 12 or 13 wins, that's how good he has been pitching all season long," said Braves catcher Brian McCann, who doubled and scored and drove in a pair of runs with sacrifice flies. "We just really haven't been scoring for him. Tonight, we got the timely hits and we were able to pull it out, and he helped. He's an athlete. He can hit. He can run."	Rafael Soriano, the last of five Braves pitchers, allowed a bloop single to Seth Smith to start the ninth inning but then struck out the side for his 12th save in 13 opportunities.	Trailing 4-0, the Rockies rallied to within one with a three-run seventh. Troy Tulowitzki connected off Jurrjens for his 15th homer of the season. Ian Stewart followed with a double off the center-field wall, finishing Jurrjens, who went six innings and gave up two runs on five hits with three strikeouts and three walks.	Peter Moylan relieved and struck out Chris Iannetta, but Smith delivered an RBI single and pinch-hitter Garrett Atkins singled, moving Smith to third, where he scored on a passed ball.	Colorado starter Jason Marquis (11-6) went six innings, allowing three runs on seven hits but was denied in his bid for a major league-leading 12th win.	Marquis retired the first three batters he faced to extend his scoreless inning streak to 18 before seeing it come to an end in the second, when the Braves scored twice, including a chopper by Jurrjens that went through to left field for an RBI single.	Jurrjens scored the Braves third run after beating out an infield single leading off the fifth.	"It's part of the game," Marquis said of giving up a couple of hits to the opposing pitcher. "I left a sinker in the middle of the plate, it found the hole. He hit it on the ground like I wanted him to. Sometimes, they're going to find holes. The second one, I made my pitch and he hit it off the end of the bat."	Overall, Marquis said he struggled with his location.	"I wasn't getting ahead early," Marquis said. "I didn't really have any fastball command. I felt really good with my slider and cutter. I battled through it, tried to keep my team in it the best I could. It just didn't work out."	Ryan Church started in right field for the Braves a day after he was acquired from the New York Mets in exchange for outfielder Jeff Francoeur. Church went 0 for 4, but just missed a grand slam by a couple feet when Smith caught his long fly ball against the left-field fence. Church had also made a nice running catch near the wall of a fifth-inning drive by Smith.	Game notes	 The Braves announced that RHP Javier Vazquez has been scratched from Sunday's scheduled start to rest a strained lower abdominal muscle. RHP Kris Medlen will start in his place. ... Tim Hudson, on the mend from "Tommy John" surgery on his right elbow, pitched batting practice for the Braves before the game. A team spokesman said Hudson was scheduled for a rehab assignment at Single A Myrtle Beach starting July 19. ... Braves reliever Mike Gonzalez was sent back to Atlanta, where team doctors examined his sore left elbow. A Braves spokesman said it was determined Gonzalez had some tendinitis in the elbow, but should be available after the All-Star break. ... Rockies reliever Alan Embree underwent surgery to repair a fractured right tibia a day after suffering the injury when struck by a line drive off the bat of the Braves' Martin Prado. Embree was placed on the 15-day disabled list, and the Rockies recalled reliever Matt Belisle from Triple A Colorado Springs. ... Tulowitzki has hit 10 of his 15 home runs since June 8.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PHOENIX -- The Arizona Diamondbacks have been a different team since the biggest blown lead in their history.	All-Star Justin Upton matched a career high with four hits, Jon Garland allowed one run in eight innings and the Diamondbacks beat the Florida Marlins 5-1 on Saturday night.	The Diamondbacks have won back-to-back games and outscored Florida 13-1 since the Marlins hit them with a 10-spot in the eighth inning of the series opener, when Arizona let a 7-0 lead turn into a 14-7 loss.	"I expected us to dust ourselves off and play well," Diamondbacks manager A.J. Hinch said. "We had been playing too well and working too hard to allow that inning to dictate the rest of the weekend. I did expect us to stand up and make a fight against these guys on our home turf, in front of our home fans, to end the first half."	Upton led the way on Saturday with three singles, a triple and an RBI, and Miguel Montero added a two-run double for the Diamondbacks, who won for the seventh time in eight games.	With one day to go until the All-Star break, the second-place Marlins fell four games behind Philadelphia in the NL East. Florida opens the second half of the season with a four-game series against the Phillies in Miami.	"We're getting close to the break and wanted to at least finish one or two games behind the Phillies because we've got them at home the first series," said Jorge Cantu, who had three hits and drove in the Marlins' only run. "We're trying to get as much ground as possible (on) those guys."	Although he has pitched well lately, Garland (5-8) had gone nine starts without a victory and won for the first time since May 19 -- also against Florida.	"He's deserved more wins, and he earned this one today," Hinch said.	Garland gave up seven hits, walked one and struck out five in his longest start.	Garland said he wasn't comfortable after his pregame bullpen session, and he gave up six hits in the first three innings. But he allowed only one run to score.	After the third inning, Garland allowed only two hits. But he didn't try to persuade Hinch to let him go for his 10th career complete game.	"I knew there was probably no chance," Garland said.	The Diamondbacks entered 8-16 against left-handed starters but jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the first against Sean West (3-4).	With the bases loaded and one out, Montero knocked in two runs with a ground-rule double down the right-field line. Montero, who has seen more playing time since starter Chris Snyder went on the disabled list with a back injury, extended his hitting streak to eight games.	Gerardo Parra followed with an RBI groundout to shortstop.	Arizona added another run in the second on Upton's two-out single.	After Florida cut the lead to 4-1 on Jorge Cantu's two-out single in the third, the Diamondbacks got the run back in the fifth, when Upton tripled and scored on Parra's fielder's choice grounder.	West, who opened the season at Double-A Jacksonville, lasted 4 2/3 innings in his 10th big league start. He allowed five runs and nine hits, walked four and struck out one.	After the game, the Marlins said they would send West to the minors, but the team didn't announce a corresponding move.	Manager Fredi Gonzalez said he wants West to improve his curveball and changeup, and he expressed optimism that West would return to the majors.	"He just needs to work on stuff," Gonzalez said. "Here's a young kid that, it's a diamond in the rough. He's not polished. We're asking him to compete at the major league level with one weapon -- it's a fastball."	Game notes	 Arizona OF Conor Jackson, out since May 12 with pneumonia, has worked out four straight days, and Hinch is optimistic Jackson will return this season. ... Marlins RHP Josh Johnson will start the series finale. Arizona handed Johnson (7-2) one of his two losses on May 19 in Miami. ... West singled in the third for his first career hit. ... Arizona improved to 9-7 against NL East clubs. The Diamondbacks have losing records against the other two divisions and the American League.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Not even getting one of their All-Star pitchers knocked out of the game by a line drive was enough to slow down the San Francisco Giants.	Matt Cain left after throwing only 35 pitches but was bailed out by five San Francisco relievers, who scattered three hits over the final 7 1/3 innings of the Giants' 2-1 win over the San Diego Padres on Saturday.	"You don't win a game like that unless your bullpen comes through for you," San Francisco manager Bruce Bochy said. "You lose one of your horses in the second inning, that's a big blow for your club. You need your bullpen to step it up and they all did. We needed good pitching from the 'pen and they came through for us."	Justin Miller (2-1), San Francisco's long reliever all season, allowed just one hit over 3 1/3 innings and used his changeup to keep the Padres' hitters off balance.	Brandon Medders, Sergio Romo, Jeremy Affeldt and Brian Wilson completed the seven-hitter for San Francisco. Wilson pitched 1 1/3 innings for his 23rd save in 27 chances.	"The starting staff has taken away innings from us all year in a very positive way so any time we can go out there and try to perform and pick up the team, we're definitely up to the challenge," Miller said. "It's just an amazing staff to be around. We've got Cy Youngs, we've got 300-game winners so it's easy to overlook the bullpen. But I think that's what relievers like also, is just to go out there and do our job quietly and get ready for the next game."	The Giants moved a season-high 11 games over .500 and within six games of the Los Angeles Dodgers for first in the NL West. San Francisco also owns the best home record in the majors with a 31-14 mark.	Pablo Sandoval homered for the second straight day to provide San Francisco with all the offense they needed.	A day after Jonathan Sanchez pitched a no-hitter, the Giants beat the Padres for a third straight game behind Sandoval.	Sandoval hit his 15th homer of the season in the fourth, a two-run shot off San Diego starter Tim Stauffer, who was making his first major league appearance in nearly two years.	Cain, the Giants' All-Star pitcher who entered tied for the second-most wins in the National League, was hit just above his right elbow by Stauffer's line drive with two outs. The ball ricocheted off Cain toward the third-base dugout as the Giants pitcher grimaced in pain while walking around on the field.	Cain then circled back behind the pitcher's mound where he was met by trainer Dave Groeschner, manager Bruce Bochy and pitching coach Dave Righetti. After a brief conversation, Cain attempted to throw a warmup pitch, but the ball sailed over the head of catcher Eli Whiteside.	That forced Bochy to go to his bullpen, beginning with Miller. The right-hander got Everth Cabrera to ground out to end the second then retired nine of the next 10, getting a double play to end the fourth following Chase Headley's one-out single.	Cabrera hit a one-out double in the eighth off Romo, stole third and scored when Whiteside's throw sailed into left field.	Affeldt replaced Romo and walked Tony Gwynn Jr. before getting Adrian Gonzalez to fly out. Wilson then struck out Kevin Kouzmanoff to escape the jam.	Called up from Triple-A Portland prior to the game, Stauffer (0-1) retired his first 10 batters before Randy Winn blooped a single to left. Sandoval then hit the next pitch into the left field stands to give the Giants a 2-0 lead.	Stauffer allowed only four hits in seven innings and matched his career high with seven strikeouts in his first start since Aug. 26, 2007.	"I felt like I did everything I could," said Stauffer, who missed all of 2008 after shoulder surgery. "I've felt the last 3-4 weeks as good as I've felt in the last five years. I'm able to pitch, let it go without fear of whether I might hurt my shoulder again. All this work is to get here, and hopefully stay here."	Game notes	 Giants 2B Juan Uribe, whose error at 3B wound up giving the San Diego Padres their only baserunner in Sanchez's no-hitter, was originally charged with an error in the fourth on Saturday night before the official scorekeeper later ruled the play a hit. ... To make room for Stauffer, the Padres outrighted INF Craig Stansberry to Triple-A Portland. ... Whiteside made his second straight start while Bengie Molina was with his wife, Jamie, for the birth of the couple's first child.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SEATTLE -- Rob Johnson kicked the dirt in frustration. He had just missed getting a bunt down in a key situation with the go-ahead run on first.	Now his at bat seemed like a failure before it was over.	The bunt sign was taken off and Johnson, who had been hitting .199, swung away for a tiebreaking, two-run homer that lifted the Seattle Mariners to a 4-1 victory Saturday night over the Texas Rangers.	"I was asked to do a job and I didn't get the bunt down," Johnson said. "I tried to bunt a slider in the dirt and I was pretty upset at myself. They call on you to do a job and you want to do it."	The rookie catcher's first homer this season and second of his career came off Kevin Millwood (8-7), who pitched six solid innings, but couldn't retire any of the three batters he faced in the seventh.	Ichiro Suzuki added an RBI single later in the inning and Russell Branyan hit his 22nd home run in the third.	Jarrod Washburn (6-6) gave up a run on Ian Kinsler's double in the third, and allowed only four hits in seven innings.	"It couldn't happen to a better guy," Washburn said. "He works hard behind the plate. He takes a lot of pride in everything he does back there but I know his offensive side has frustrated him a little bit. It's good to see him get that big hit."	David Aardsma finished the ninth for his 19th save in 21 chances.	"We had the bunt on and then took it off," manager Don Wakamatsu said. "He goes deep and after he hit it I asked him if that was his first one and he said no. And he abruptly reminded me that he hit one in Oakland last year" (where Wakamatsu was the bench coach).	"So I had to laugh at that."	Millwood was charged with all four runs on six hits in six-plus innings.	The Rangers had a chance to score in the seventh inning after Marlon Byrd reached on a throwing error by shortstop Cedeno.	After Nelson Cruz's liner fell at the feet of center fielder Franklin Gutierrez, Byrd broke back toward first, apparently thinking the ball had been caught, and he couldn't scramble to second before Gutierrez's throw.	Byrd, who was stealing on the play, said he couldn't find the ball off the bat.	"I saw Gutierrez coming in and wasn't sure if he would catch the ball or not cause I still couldn't find the ball," he said. "I hit the bag and thought he would catch it and tried to go back to first. ... It ended up dropping in front of him and the force play is back in order."	Manager Ron Washington came out to argue, to no avail, and then Jarrod Saltalamacchia crushed a lineout to second baseman Jose Lopez.	"If he stays at second base and Salty comes up and hits the same ball that he hit, we got a run with runners on first and third," Washington said.	Game notes	 3B Jack Hannahan, acquired in a trade with Oakland for minor league pitcher Justin Souza, learned about it at 9:30 Saturday morning. He was in Fresno but managed get to Seattle by 5 p.m. and was in the lineup. To make room, the club sent RHP Brandon Morrow to Triple-A Tacoma. I wasn't expecting it," Morrow said. I understand the situation. They need a roster spot. Ill go down to Tacoma knowing there are no promises when Ill come back. Well need a starter on the 25th, and well see what happens." ... OF David Murphy missed his second game with a strained finger on his right hand. Asked who could use the three-day All-Star break the most, Washington said Kinsler. I don't think that kid has ever been this tired," he said. ... Since Andruw Jones hit three consecutive home runs July 8 against the Angels, he has gone 0-for-13.

DETROIT -- Brandon Inge said he wasn't sure how to prepare for Monday's Home Run Derby, but the Cleveland Indians gave him a good chance to warm up.	Inge homered twice Sunday, giving him 21 on the season, and the Detroit Tigers went on to rout the Indians 10-1.	"I don't know what I'm going to do out there, but I'm also not sure how I've gotten to 21 in the first place," said Inge, who has only reached 20 homers one other time in his nine-year career. "I'm just trying to play hard and still have fun, and that will be my plan for St. Louis too."	Inge and Clete Thomas combined for eight RBIs, with Thomas falling a double short of the cycle.	"I thought about the double when I was coming up the last time, but I was trying to keep my mind clear," said Thomas, who has replaced Magglio Ordonez in the lineup against right-handed pitching. "This was just a great day -- you almost hate to have a break when you are on a roll."	All-Star pitcher Justin Verlander (10-4) went seven shutout innings, allowing five hits and three walks. He struck out eight, giving him 149 for the season -- the most by a Tiger pitcher at the All-Star break since Mickey Lolich had 156 in 1972.	"I thought I threw the ball pretty well, but the guys make it pretty easy when they put up 10 runs," he said.	Verlander is 3-0 with a 0.39 ERA against Cleveland this season.	"He's been pretty special this year," Tigers manager Jim Leyland added. "That's why he's getting on that plane to St. Louis."	Tomo Ohka (0-3) took the loss, giving up five runs on five hits and a walk in 3 2/3 innings.	"My fastball was up," he said. "I felt OK, but I kept making bad pitches."	Cleveland (35-54) has lost 11 of its last 16 games and 19 of 26. The Indians enter the break 14 games behind first-place Detroit.	"It's been a disappointment," Cleveland manager Eric Wedge said. "There's a long way to go, and I still feel good about the lineup we are putting out there every day, but we've got to improve the rotation and our bullpen."	Detroit took a 1-0 lead in the second on Thomas' RBI triple, then put the game away with nine runs in a three-inning stretch.	In the fourth, Thomas hit a three-run homer and Inge followed with his 20th home run of the season to put the Tigers ahead 5-0. The same pair struck again in the fifth, with Thomas hitting an RBI single and Inge following with a two-run homer.	Detroit added two more in the sixth when Marcus Thames singled with the bases loaded and Asdrubal Cabrera misplayed the ball to let the 10th run score.	Cleveland loaded the bases with two out in the seventh, but Verlander struck out pinch-hitter Jamey Carroll with his 116th and final pitch, then left to a standing ovation from the crowd of 39,680.	The Indians loaded the bases in the ninth on a double and two walks, and Zach Miner walked Carroll to force in Cleveland's only run of the game.	"We've seen a pitcher this year that has been about as good against one team as you can be," Wedge said. "When he's got all three of his pitches going, he's as good as anyone, and that's what happened today."	Game notes	 Verlander, Inge and fellow All-Stars Curtis Granderson and Edwin Jackson were honored in a pregame ceremony. They were scheduled to fly to St. Louis Sunday evening on owner Mike Ilitch's private plane. "That's a great gesture by Mr. I," Verlander said. ... Before this season, Verlander had faced Cleveland 15 times, going 4-10 with a 6.70 ERA. ... C Victor Martinez, Cleveland's only All-Star, went 1 for 3 before leaving the game after the Indians fell behind by double figures. ... Detroit is 27-13 at home, its best 40-game start since 1984.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

CHICAGO -- Carlos Zambrano shrugged off his latest home run, admitting that being a starting pitcher makes it easier for him to hit.	Whatever the reason, Zambrano is far more dangerous than most pitchers when he comes to the plate.	Zambrano went deep for the third time this season and pitched six solid innings, helping the Chicago Cubs beat the St. Louis Cardinals 7-3 on Sunday in the first game of a day-night doubleheader.	Zambrano has 19 career homers, tops in franchise history for pitchers, but isn't interested in a regular opportunity to hit.	"My job is to pitch. That's the thing I know best," he said. "I think being an everyday player, hitter it makes it tough because pitchers study you and know how to pitch. If they figure out how to pitch to me every day I don't think I would hit that many home runs."	Micah Hoffpauir had a three-run homer for the Cubs, who closed within 2½ games of the NL Central-leading Cardinals. Zambrano (5-4) allowed three runs and five hits.	Albert Pujols was 1 for 4 with two RBIs for the Cardinals, but also committed a two-run error in the seventh inning.	"He doesn't get enough credit what he does defensively," Cubs shortstop Ryan Theriot said. "Albert always seems to be in the right spot at the right time. Yeah, that was definitely a surprise."	St. Louis starter Kyle Lohse, who was activated from the 15-day disabled list before the game, struggled in his first appearance since leaving an outing against Cincinnati on June 3 because of a strained right forearm.	Lohse (4-5) surrendered Theriot's one-out double in the first and walked Alfonso Soriano before Hoffpauir hit his next pitch for his eighth homer.	"Soriano put together a really good at-bat. Hoffpauir's first pitch [was] a curve," said Lohse, who allowed four runs and eight hits in five innings. "It wasn't a bad pitch but he jumped all over it. As the game went on I pitched pretty well."	St. Louis rallied to tie it at 3 but Zambrano hit a solo drive in the fourth to give the Cubs the lead again.	"He swings a big bat. He can hit," Theriot said. "It's no surprise. I think everybody knows if they throw one way where he is swinging he is going to hurt you."	Zambrano settled down after a slow start, striking out six of the last 10 hitters he faced. He finished with seven Ks and two walks.	The Cubs added two more in the seventh, taking advantage of two errors. With one out and the bases loaded, second baseman Skip Schumaker made an errant throw that moved catcher Jason LaRue off the plate that allowed Soriano to score. Hoffpauir and Milton Bradley came home when Koyie Hill hit a routine grounder that went between Pujols' legs for his seventh error of the season.	LaRue thought he got his feet on the plate for the forceout on Schumaker's throw, but plate umpire Randy Marsh disagreed.	"He was out," LaRue said. "It basically appeared the way I tried to get back to the plate that I didn't get it, but, I know I got it."	Pujols hit a two-run double off Zambrano in the third to give him 87 RBIs on the year, and Joe Thurston also singled in a run in the inning.	Game notes	 To make room for Lohse, the Cardinals optioned reliever Blake Hawksworth to Triple-A Memphis. ... In the fifth inning, Pujols hit what looked to be a routine infield popup. Theriot lost the ball in the sun and dropped it. Pujols was running hard right out of the box and tried to get to second, but was tagged out by second baseman Jeff Baker right before hitting the bag. ... Cubs 1B Derrek Lee was out of the lineup after leaving Saturday's game with neck spasms, but was expected to start the nightcap.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK -- Even the home run apple wasn't prepared for the Mets' sudden power surge.	The apple didn't fail to pop up because it's had little practice at spacious Citi Field -- the Mets have hit just 28 homers there this season. Rather, Fernando Tatis' shot came too quickly after Brian Schneider's for the apple to do its job: show itself after every Mets homer.	New York went 80 innings overall without a home run until Schneider and Tatis connected in the eighth inning of the Mets' 9-7 win over the Cincinnati Reds on Sunday.	So, as the cherished home run apple took the 2½ minutes it needs to reset after Schneider's home run, the 40,014 fans who've had little to cheer for the past two months chanted "Apple! Apple!" until the end of the inning. Then the gleaming new apple -- Shea Stadium's is now on display near an entrance -- finally popped out of its center-field hole.	"It was good to see the apple finally come up," Mets manager Jerry Manuel said after New York's second straight win. "It took its time, but it finally came up."	Even better for Manuel was seeing a rare, robust Mets offense.	"It's good. It'll give us a little momentum, and I think a little more importantly some confidence going into the second half," David Wright said. "I'm excited the way we swung the bats. Got some big hits, took some walks. Got some big RBIs."	Gary Sheffield had three RBIs and Daniel Murphy drove in two runs to key the Mets, who had their best offensive output at home since June 24, when they scored 11 against St. Louis.	Luis Castillo had three hits and scored three runs, Wright hit a long RBI double and Jeff Francoeur had two hits in his second game with New York. The Mets amassed 16 hits in improving to 8-12 since Carlos Beltran went on the DL June 22.	The Mets needed the offense after the bullpen nearly wasted a 9-3 lead. Francisco Rodriguez gave up a run in the ninth but finished for his 23rd save.	"I thought the guys made an effort, they kept coming back. They didn't quit," Cincinnati manager Dusty Baker said.	New York scored more than five runs in a game for only the fourth time since Beltran went out. The outburst came on a day the club received a good injury report for the first time in a couple months: Carlos Delgado (hip) and Jose Reyes (right leg) had encouraging workouts.	High expectations for a playoff run wrecked by injuries, the Mets head into the All-Star break 42-45, 6 1/2 games back of Philadelphia in the NL East. The Reds, who added Jay Bruce to their injury list Saturday with a broken wrist, are also 42-45.	After Wright had an RBI double to center in the first, New York batted around in the third, helping extend Aaron Harang's winless skid to nine starts dating to May 25.	Sheffield had a two-run single, Murphy an RBI double and Alex Cora a run-scoring hit to make it 5-0. The last time the Mets scored at least four runs in an inning was July 2 at Pittsburgh.	Harang (5-9) left after three innings, having given up five runs and eight hits.	"I'm going to take these few days and regroup," Harang said. "I didn't have my location. I was missing spots, having to come back and having to throw strikes and they were up there swinging. They hit a few bloops, too. It just didn't work out."	Pelfrey (7-4) rebounded from his start July 7 against the Dodgers in which he gave up five runs in three innings by shutting down the poor-hitting Reds. He gave up two singles in the first, then retired 10 in a row before walking the first two batters of the fifth.	After walking Ramon Hernandez leading off, Pelfrey committed his sixth balk, becoming the first pitcher with six balks in season since Chris Michalak for Toronto and Texas in 2001, according to STATS LLC.	He gave up an RBI double to Adam Rosales, who was called up from Triple-A Louisville on Sunday, and RBI singles to Chris Dickerson and Willy Taveras to make it 7-3. But his manager left Pelfrey in to work through the jam, and he rewarded Manuel with two scoreless innings.	"I think that was huge. As a pitcher you want to be left out there to work out of some tough situations, and he showed the faith in me to be able to do that," Pelfrey said.	Game notes	 The Mets had been last in majors with 26 homers at home. With two today, moved one ahead of Pittsburgh. ... The Reds' Joey Votto was ejected in the fourth inning after being called out on strikes for the second time. ... The Mets optioned INF Argenis Reyes to Triple-A Buffalo after the game. ... Reds RF Dickerson left after the fifth inning with back spasms. ... The last time the Mets had gone at least 80 innings without a homer was April 15-25, 2002. ... The last team to go at least 80 innings without a home run was the San Francisco Giants, last year. They went 116 straight innings without a home run between July 22 and August 5, according to STATS LLC.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

BALTIMORE -- Brad Bergesen began the season pitching at the Triple-A level for the first time, uncertain if he would receive an invitation to pitch in the major leagues this season.	Now, as the Baltimore Orioles enter the All-Star break, Bergesen is the most consistent member of their starting rotation. The 23-year-old rookie owns a solid 3.54 ERA, leads the team in innings pitched and is tied for most wins.	Bergesen took a shutout into the seventh inning Sunday, and Baltimore got a home run from Oscar Salazar in a 4-2 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays.	Bergesen (6-3) gave up two runs and seven hits in 6 2/3 innings. The right-hander is 5-1 with a 2.35 ERA over his past nine starts.	"Bergesen sure had a great first half for us. I think he has established himself as a real nice story in the American League this year as a starting pitcher," manager Dave Trembley said. "It seems like every time he pitches he gives us a chance to win, and it was no different today."	Not bad for a guy who last year split time between Class A and Double-A ball.	"The first half was such a huge learning experience," Bergesen said. "I'll take that as the positives and also reflect on the negatives to know what I need to do in the second half."	Brian Roberts had two RBIs for the Orioles, who took two of three from Toronto. Baltimore has won six of its last nine series and trails the fourth-place Blue Jays by only three games in the AL East.	Toronto has lost 12 of 15 and went 2-8 on a swing through Yankee Stadium, Tampa Bay and Baltimore. Each of those 10 road games were decided by two runs or fewer.	"It was a terrible road trip for us. We've had worse, but this wasn't too good," said manager Cito Gaston, who returned to the helm after missing two games to attend the funeral of his sister.	On May 18, Toronto was 27-14 and in first place. Now the Blue Jays are 44-46 and 11 games out.	"Obviously you expect more, and you want more, as a ballclub," outfielder Vernon Wells said. "I think this break comes at a good time. Guys can go home and relax and get away from the game for a couple of days. Hopefully when we get back to work we'll have a better second half."	Bergesen took a 3-0 lead into the seventh, but was pulled after the Blue Jays used three hits and a sacrifice fly to get within a run.	Danys Baez got the final out in the seventh, Jim Johnson worked the eighth and George Sherrill retired three straight to earn his 20th save.	Bergesen outpitched fellow rookie Marc Rzepczynski (0-1), who allowed three runs and five hits over six innings in his second major league start.	In his first outing, against Tampa Bay, the left-hander allowed one run and two hits in six innings.	"I think I was better last one," Rzepczynski said. "Today I didn't have my changeup at all."	Because Bergesen was so good, Rzepczynski had little margin for error.	After Wells popped out with the bases loaded to end the Toronto third, Baltimore took a 2-0 lead in the bottom half when Roberts doubled in a run and scored on Nick Markakis' single.	Salazar's second homer of the season made it 3-0 in the sixth. Rzepczynski has surrendered only two homers in 100 innings this year, including his time in the minor leagues.	"One bad pitch, one bad slider to Salazar, and he took it out," Rzepczynski said.	The Blue Jays got an RBI double from David Dellucci and a sacrifice fly by Marco Scutaro in the seventh. In the bottom half, Roberts singled in an unearned run after a throwing error by Scutaro at shortstop.	Game notes	 Home plate umpire Ron Kulpa left in the third inning with a mild concussion after being struck in the mask by a foul ball. Dale Scott took over at home as part of a three-man crew. ... Dellucci was 0 for 19 with Toronto before his double in the seventh. ... Toronto had four doubles to increase its major league-leading total to 200.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BOSTON -- Josh Beckett's 100th career victory may have been his best.	The Red Sox ace capped a brilliant first half of the season with a three-hitter, joining teammate Tim Wakefield as the only 11-game winners in the AL as the Boston Red Sox beat the Kansas City Royals 6-0 Sunday.	"It's pretty memorable" to post his 100th win, Beckett said, "and the way I did it is cool."	Beckett (11-3) retired the first nine batters, five on strikeouts. It was his second shutout and complete game of the season following his 3-0 win over Atlanta on June 20. He finished with seven strikeouts and no walks.	In seven career complete games, his 94 pitches Sunday tied that Braves game for the fewest and the three hits were the fewest he allowed.	"Oh, he was good," Boston manager Terry Francona said. "He attacked the strike zone with his fastball and it was very obvious they wanted to hit his fastball."	They couldn't.	"Not a lot we could do with him," Kansas City manager Trey Hillman said.	It was a fitting end to a stretch in which Beckett went 9-1 with a 2.14 ERA after struggling at 2-2 with a 7.22 ERA through April.	Beckett allowed a ground-ball double down the right-field line to David DeJesus leading off the fourth and singles by Mitch Maier and Mark Teahen in the seventh.	"Believe it or not, he had to battle in the middle innings," Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek said. "It don't think it comes that easy for him as people may think. He falls off it as much as anybody and has to make adjustments during games.	"He's pretty much a bulldog."	Rookie Aaron Bates, called up last Monday, went 3 for 4 with two doubles and an RBI, and stabbed a line drive by Brayan Pena for the second out of the fifth. Bates could be sent down after the All-Star break with Mike Lowell possibly coming off the disabled list.	"I want to learn as much as I can in the short amount of time I'm here, and if you can help them win some games that's obviously the main goal, to help win," Bates said.	Bruce Chen (0-4) and four Royals relievers walked nine batters. Chen came out after allowing the first two batters in the fourth to reach base.	"Lots of balls in the air and too dangerous to leave him in and have any chance at all," Hillman said.	Boston scored a run in the first on Kevin Youkilis' RBI single and three in the fourth when Bates bashed a run-scoring double, David Ortiz grounded out for another RBI and Varitek walked with the bases loaded.	The fifth run came across in the fifth when Nick Green, who had walked and taken third on a single by Bates, scored on Jacoby Ellsbury's double-play grounder. Rocco Baldelli doubled in the final run in the eighth.	Beckett and Wakefield, also 11-3, will represent the Red Sox along with closer Jonathan Papelbon, left fielder Jason Bay and Youkilis in the All-Star Game Tuesday in St. Louis. AL starting second baseman Dustin Pedroia withdrew Sunday to be with his wife, who has had complications with her pregnancy.	The Red Sox won four of their last five games to improve to 54-34, their fifth-best record at the All-Star break since 1954. They've held at least a share of first place in the AL East since June 9. Kansas City lost for the fourth time in five games -- including a 1-0 loss to Boston on Friday -- and fell 14 games below .500.	Beckett allowed two runs or less for the ninth time in 11 starts and is 6-0 in nine home starts this year.	He began the game by striking out DeJesus and Maier and retiring Billy Butler on a fly to left. He started the second with two more strikeouts, against Teahen and Jose Guillen, then got Pena on an infield popup. In the third, he struck out John Buck.	After DeJesus doubled in the fourth, Maier sacrificed him to third but he was stranded. Beckett then retired all six batters in the fifth and sixth on 17 pitches.	He had his most trouble in the seventh when Maier led off with a single. Butler struck out, but Teahen singled Maier to third and Guillen was hit by a pitch, loading the bases. Beckett escaped the jam by getting Pena to ground to second baseman Pedroia, who started a double play.	Game notes	 Bay walked on his first three at bats on the minimum of 12 pitches then was hit by pitches on his other two at bats. ... Red Sox starters have allowed three runs or less in each of the last six games. ... Chen pitched in just his fourth game in the majors since undergoing elbow surgery in the Fall of 2007. ... Ellsbury became the second Red Sox player with at least 40 stolen bases in two or more seasons. Tris Speaker did it there times from 1912-14. ... Francona said Clay Buchholz, having an outstanding season at Triple-A Pawtucket, will start Boston's first game after the All-Star break, at Toronto.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PHILADELPHIA -- Pedro Feliz provided the offense, J.A. Happ kept the Pirates in check, and in a span of little more than a week the Phillies have gotten themselves on track.	Feliz hit a first-inning grand slam, and Happ allowed one run in seven innings to help Philadelphia cap a 9-1 homestand with a 5-2 win over Pittsburgh on Sunday. The winning run has erased much of the misery of the 4-14 stretch that preceded it.	"We came off of a real down spell, came home and won some games here," said Phillies manager Charlie Manuel. "We've been able to put a little streak together before the break."	The Phillies, who won their fifth straight, scored five times in the first off rookie Virgil Vazquez.	Happ (6-0) welcomed the support and handcuffed the Pirates most of the afternoon. The left-hander recorded his fifth straight strong outing, compiling a 2.00 ERA during that span and solidifying a spot in the starting rotation. Happ began the season in the bullpen, but has since switched spots with Chan Ho Park, a move that has worked out well for both.	"Seems like it makes sense that way," said Happ, who has always stated his preference for being a starter.	Ryan Madson tossed a scoreless eighth inning and J.C. Romero worked the ninth.	Jimmy Rollins began the game with a walk, his 10th of the homestand, and Shane Victorino and Chase Utley followed with singles off Vazquez (1-3). Ryan Howard plated the first run with a sacrifice fly to deep center. Three batters later, Feliz sent Vazquez's pitch into first few rows in left field.	"I was happy to do that for the team," said Feliz, whose grand slam was the sixth of his career. "I was trying to get a good pitch to hit. He was a little high, and I got a good swing."	Added Vazquez, "I almost got out of that inning with a little pain, but he got me."	Philadelphia chased the right-hander, who was making his fourth major league start, after Rollins and Victorino reached again with one out in the second.	Pittsburgh's first run came in the sixth inning, when rookie-of-the-year candidate Andrew McCutchen singled and scored on All-Star Freddy Sanchez's double.	The Pirates hit into three double plays, including the seventh, when McCutchen fell for a fake by Rollins and Utley on a fly to right, and was doubled off first base.	"A young baserunning mistake," Russell said. "We're young, but we're making improvements."	Left-fielder Garrett Jones led off the ninth with his fifth home run, third in three games.	Solid pitching and a resurgent offense has contributed to Philadelphia's best homestand since May 31-June 12, 2005, when they went 12-1. The Phillies (48-38) enter the All-Star break and a comfortable lead over the second-place Marlins.	At the break last year, Philadelphia was 52-44 and a half game ahead of the New York Mets.	"We finally put it together at home and got some wins," Happ said. "We're in a good position now, and hopefully we'll stay there."	Howard said the during the bad stretch was to remember that good times will follow, like they did during last season's World Series run.	"We don't panic," Howard said. "We knew we were going to play better. It was just a matter of time."	Game notes	 Pirates left-hander Zach Duke was named to the NL All-Star team. He replaces San Francisco 's Matt Cain, who was hit below his right elbow with a line drive on Saturday. "I was going to go home and sit on my butt for a few days, but that won't happen now," Duke said. ... The Phillies cavalcade of All-Stars received rousing applause before Sunday's game. Philadelphia sends Howard, Utley, Jayson Werth, Victorino and Raul Ibanez, plus Manuel and his entire coaching staff. ... The Phillies are 17-9 in day games, best in the NL. Manuel said Jamie Moyer will start Thursday, in the first game of the second half. He'll be followed by Cole Hamels, Joe Blanton and Happ.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- The Oakland Athletics didn't play like a team entering the All-Star break with a losing record for the first time in a decade.	Orlando Cabrera hit a tiebreaking RBI single in Oakland's four-run seventh, leading the Athletics to a 7-3 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays on Sunday.	Kurt Suzuki and pinch-hitter Jack Cust each singled in a run and Mark Ellis drove in Landon Powell with a groundout to set up Cabrera's hit off Chad Bradford.	"Playing a great team like Tampa Bay and taking two out of three at their place where they play awesome baseball is a nice confidence boost," Suzuki said.	Oakland (37-49) last went into the break with a sub .500 record during the 1999 season (43-44).	Suzuki and Ryan Sweeney tacked on RBI singles in the eighth and Ellis connected in the ninth to make it 7-3.	"To take games from this team is no easy job," Ellis said. "Especially to come from behind, which is not something we've done a lot of this year."	Oakland starter Brett Anderson left after four scoreless innings due to lower back stiffness. The left-hander, coming off a two-hitter in a 6-0 win over Boston Monday, gave up three hits.	"We were just monitoring it because his velocity was down a bit," manager Bob Geren said. "It got to the point that I thought for numerous reasons he should exit the game. It stiffened up and it could have been a potential injury."	Michael Wuertz (5-1) got the win despite allowing a run and three hits in 1 1/3 innings and Andrew Bailey got six outs for his 10th save.	Rays right-hander James Shields took a shutout into the seventh, but wound up allowing three runs and six hits over 6 1/3 innings.	"It was strange," Shields said. "I was cruising. That's just kind of how the game goes sometimes."	Tampa Bay has lost two in a row at home after winning nine straight at Tropicana Field.	"They were tough losses," manager Joe Maddon said. "All of a sudden they bit us. I thought we had a nice thing going on there."	Tampa Bay took a 3-0 lead in the sixth on a two-run double by Pat Burrell and Jason Bartlett's RBI single off Wuertz.	"It was very disappointing," Rays right fielder Ben Zobrist said. "It was a tight game up to when we scored those three runs. It was a tough day for our bullpen. They have been pitching so well."	The Rays have allowed just 26 runs in the seventh this season, but were touched for four during the inning in each of the past two games.	Dan Wheeler (3-2), who followed Shields, was charged with one run while recording one out and took the loss.	Oakland threatened in the first, but Cabrera was thrown out by Zobrist when he tried to score on Matt Holliday's fly ball.	Rajai Davis started in right field one day after Sweeney was benched for not running out a batted ball. Geren said putting Davis, who hit a two-run homer in Saturday's 7-2 win over the Rays, in the lineup was a baseball decision.	Sweeney entered in the seventh after Cust hit for Davis.	Game notes	 Tampa Bay All-Star LF Carl Crawford rested. He struck out as pinch hitter in the ninth. ... Cabrera has a hit in 21 of his last 23 games. ... Geren said his post All-Star break rotation will be LHP Dallas Braden, RHP Trevor Cahill, RHP Vin Mazzaro, Anderson and LHP Gio Gonzalez. ... Athletics 1B Jason Giambi (bruised right elbow) was sore, but was available off the bench. ... Suzuki has a career-high 10 game hitting streak. ... Burrell has 10 RBIs in 26 games since returning from a strained neck on June 12.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MILWAUKEE -- The Los Angeles Dodgers played with Manny and without him, and still finished the first half of the season with the best record in baseball.	So what's Joe Torre's grade of his group at the All-Star break?	"Incomplete," the manager said. "That's the only thing I can give it at this point because the back half, just like in golf the back nine, is the toughest one to play. We're going to have to go out there and continue to live up to ourselves."	All-Star Orlando Hudson homered twice, Clayton Kershaw won his fifth consecutive road start and Los Angeles capped the best first half in the majors with a 7-4 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers on Sunday.	Manny Ramirez went 3 for 3 and scored twice to continue his torrid pace since returning from a 50-game drug suspension, helping the Dodgers finish a 6-3 road trip for their best start in 32 years at 56-32.	"Now we're coming into the second half and I think the second half is a tough one," Ramirez said. "We hope everything goes well and the main goal is to go to the World Series."	The Dodgers have history on their side.	The 1977 Dodgers were 57-31 after 88 games and 59-33 at the All-Star break in Tommy Lasorda's first full season as manager, eventually losing the World Series to the New York Yankees in six games.	These Dodgers led by Torre seem poised to make a similar run with Kershaw improving to 4-0 with a microscopic 0.76 ERA in his last six starts and Ramirez picking up where he left off.	"The main thing I'm worried about is my legs and I'm getting there day by day, so we've still got three more months to go and I'm going to get there," the slugger said.	Ramirez doubled in the first, singled in the third, walked in the fifth and doubled in the seventh. He's 11 for 29 with three homers, nine RBIs and eight runs in nine games since returning from the ban.	"He just seems to be locked in," Torre said.	Backup catcher Brad Ausmus also homered, calling it "pure luck," and James Loney drove in two runs with two singles.	"One thing you always a have a concern when you're heading toward the All-Star break is you sort of take it before it gets here, this ballclub didn't do that," Torre said. "If we win series, we can't get hurt."	Hudson, who had been in a 3-for-41 slump, homered in the sixth and eighth. The Dodgers continued their power surge, belting 10 homers in the three-game series after hitting seven in the previous eight games.	"It was nice, but the main thing was we got a big W to end the first half, another series win and we'll start it back again on Thursday," Hudson said.	Staked to a 2-0 lead before he took the mound, Kershaw (7-5) gave up one run and two hits over six-plus innings. He struck out four and walked five, increasing his major league-high total to 59.	"I had some dumb walks," Kershaw said. "If you're going to walk them, you better not let them score. You've got to bear down with people on base. I got bailed out a little bit today."	The Brewers, who've tumbled out of the NL Central lead by losing eight of 11, scored twice in the seventh and eighth, but Hudson homered in the eighth and Ramon Troncoso got three outs to earn his fifth save in six chances in place of Jonathan Broxton (toe).	Troncoso allowed the tying run to come to the plate after one-out singles by Frank Catalanotto and Jason Kendall. Corey Hart lined out and Ryan Braun popped up to end it.	Yovani Gallardo (8-7) lost his third straight start, allowing five runs and six hits in five innings.	"Something mechanically is a little off, so I tried to battle through it, but it's a good hitting team," Gallardo said. "Mistakes that I left up in the zone, they put the bat on it."	Game notes	 Kershaw ran his scoreless innings streak to 17 before it ended in the seventh when Mike Cameron scored on Bill Hall's double off reliever Hiroki Kuroda. ... It was Hudson's fourth career multihomer game and first since July 31, 2006. ... Brewers manager Ken Macha presented Prince Fielder, Braun and Trevor Hoffman with All-Star jerseys before the game. Since Hoffman was named on Sunday morning as a replacement for Broxton, he got a Braun No. 8 jersey, too. ... Brewers SS J.J. Hardy (shoulder) missed the game.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

HOUSTON -- As Kazuo Matsui hit ball after ball into the stands during a recent batting practice, Astros manager Cecil Cooper teased him about being a home run hitter.	Matsui protested, insisting that he was no home run hitter.	He showed that he can be one Sunday, knocking a three-run shot to lead the Houston Astros to a 5-0 win over the Washington Nationals.	"The was a good thing that it happened," he said through a translator. "I'm not a home a run hitter. I just try to get on base. I've only hit three home runs, but the home run [today] was big."	Matsui's shot into the first row of the stands in right field near the bullpen came in the seventh inning and gave Houston a 4-0 lead. The win gave the Astros a 3-1 series victory over the last-place Nationals and leaves Houston at .500 heading into the All-Star break.	The Astros got another solid start from Brian Moehler (6-5), who allowed seven hits in 6 1/3 innings to win for the fourth time in five decisions. Closer Jose Valverde got the last four outs for his eighth save of the season and the 150th of his career.	"Terrific, terrific job by Mr. Brian Moehler today," Cooper said. "We definitely needed it today, and he stepped up in a big way. We were a little short-handed. We only had two or three guys out there in the bullpen and Brian stepped up really huge for us."	Houston added a run in the eighth inning when Lance Berkman scored on a balk by Tyler Clippard, who looked to have lost his balance and almost fell off the mound.	"He caught his spikes on the dirt," Nationals manager Manny Acta said. "But all he had to do was release the ball and let it roll and it wouldn't have been a balk. But he's just a kid and he didn't know."	Geoff Blum was hit by a pitch in the seventh before Hunter Pence singled. Ivan Rodriguez struck out before Matsui's homer. Nationals starter Jordan Zimmermann (3-4) walked reliever Alberto Arias before he was replaced by Joe Beimel, who finally got out of the inning.	A day after getting their most runs (13) and hits (21) of the season, the Nationals got 11 hits but couldn't convert, leaving 13 men on base.	"We had a lot of hits, we just didn't have hits in the clutch situations," said Washington's Wil Nieves, who finished with a career-high four hits. "We had a couple of opportunities with runners in scoring position but we just couldn't do the job."	Nieves singled in the seventh before advancing to second on a sacrifice bunt by Zimmermann. Moehler was replaced by Arias, who allowed a single by Nyjer Morgan. Nick Johnson walked to load the bases for the second straight inning, but the Nationals came away empty again after Ryan Zimmerman popped out and Adam Dunn grounded out.	Houston was helped on that play by shifting the defense to the right to deal with the left-handed Dunn. The shift left Miguel Tejada behind second base and in perfect position to grab Dunn's grounder and get it to Berkman at first for the out.	Johnson doubled to open the sixth inning before Moehler allowed two straight walks with one out to load the bases. He got out of the jam by retiring Alberto Gonzalez and Anderson Hernandez to end the inning.	Tejada's single in the first inning scored Michael Bourn and gave Houston a 1-0 lead. Bourn had reached and advanced to second when Gonzalez overthrew first base.	Carlos Lee got a double in the fourth inning on a fly ball to left-center field. The Astros argued that it hit above the yellow line on the wall and should be a home run and the officials reviewed the call. Replays showed it hit below the line and the call stood.	Zimmermann allowed five hits and four runs with six strikeouts in 6 1/3 innings.	Game notes	 Astros RHP Doug Brocail, on the disabled list with a left hamstring injury, will throw a bullpen session on Tuesday and is scheduled to throw a simulated game Friday. He threw a bullpen session Sunday and said he is feeling great. ... Houston optioned RHP Felipe Paulino to Triple-A Round Rock after the game. The Astros will likely bring LHP Wesley Wright up from Round Rock on Thursday to fill the roster spot. ... Washington will option LHP Ross Detwiler to Triple-A Syracuse and will likely bring up RHP Garrett Mock.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

MINNEAPOLIS -- The only people more surprised by White Sox ace Mark Buehrle's clunker of an outing against Minnesota on Sunday were the Twins themselves.	Carlos Gomez drove in a career-high five runs and Minnesota had an unusually productive afternoon against Buehrle in a 13-7 victory over Chicago.	Buehrle (9-3) gave up eight runs and 10 hits in 3 1/3 innings, his shortest outing of the season.	"He left a few balls up and over the middle of the plate," said Brendan Harris, who went deep and doubled twice in three at-bats against Buehrle. "That's more than I've seen in the six or seven times I've faced him."	Gomez and Denard Span also homered against Buehrle, who has beaten Minnesota more times than any other opponent. Coming into the game, Buehrle was 23-13 with a 3.72 ERA lifetime against the Twins and 2-0 with a 1.35 ERA this season.	"I think I threw five pitches where I wanted and I think three of them got hit," Buehrle said. "It was one of those days where everything was cutting when I wanted it to sink. Even when I was throwing warmup pitches, I threw a changeup and it was cutting on me. It was one of those days where I didn't have my good stuff."	Harris and Span each had three RBIs. Gomez finished with three hits and scored three times.	"He left some balls up today and we put some good swings on it," Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said of Buehrle. "You don't see that too often against that guy."	Scott Baker (7-7) gave up five runs and six hits in 6 1/3 innings for the Twins, who took two of three from the White Sox heading into the All-Star break.	The signs were there from the beginning that this was not going to be Buehrle's day.	The big lefty made what looked to be a very heady play in the first when Span's bunt rolled down the first-base line. Buehrle slid as he gave chase, but deftly maneuvered around the ball without touching it as it trickled foul.	The athletic play took away what would have been a sure hit for Span, but two pitches later he homered to right field.	Gomez hit a three-run homer in the second and Harris added an RBI double to give the Twins a 5-0 lead and start activity in the White Sox bullpen. When Harris hit a two-run homer to make it 8-1, Buehrle was done.	"This year, I don't remember seeing Buehrle have trouble like he did today," manager Ozzie Guillen said. "He had trouble against the wrong team in the wrong ballpark. That's what you're going to get."	Jim Thome hit his 555th career homer, a three-run drive in the sixth, and Alexei Ramirez beat out an infield hit with the bases loaded in the seventh to make it 8-5. But Matt Guerrier got Jermaine Dye to pop out to second to end the threat.	Span added two walks and two stolen bases, and Gomez, the precocious 23-year-old known as "Go-Go" in the clubhouse, humorously tried to stretch a ground-rule double into a triple before third base coach Scott Ullger pointed him back to second.	His two-run single in the seventh gave the Twins some breathing room at 10-5 after the White Sox creeped back into the game.	"It was a great day," said Gomez, who was amped about heading home to the Dominican Republic to see his wife and newborn child.	The Twins did all their damage offensively without any help from AL batting leader Joe Mauer, who went 0 for 5 and struck out four times for the first time in his career.	"I think everybody should keep their ticket because they saw something that nobody will see again and that's Mauer strike out four times," Guillen said. "I'd keep the ticket and I'm going to keep the lineup card because that isn't going to happen too often."	Game notes	 White Sox rookie 3B Gordon Beckham had two errors, including one in the seventh that allowed a run to score. ... Span's drive in the first was his first career leadoff homer. ... Twins C Mike Redmond snapped an 0-for-16 slump with a single in the second inning. ... Dye had some fun before the game, throwing a couple of balls in from the outfield during a mascot T-ball game. Justin Morneau must have missed it because he was thrown out by RF Dye while trying to turn a single into a double in the fourth.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

DENVER -- Brad Hawpe prepared for his first All-Star Game by sending the Colorado Rockies into the break on a positive note.	Hawpe hit a game-ending RBI double to give the Rockies an 8-7 victory over the Atlanta Braves on Sunday and a split of the four-game series.	"What a way for Brad Hawpe to leave here and head for St. Louis," Rockies manager Jim Tracy said. "That's a very nice send-off for a class human being."	Seth Smith set up Hawpe's clutch hit with a one-out single off Luis Valdez (0-1), who was making his major league debut. After Garrett Atkins flied out, Hawpe lined an 86-mph changeup into the gap in right-center to score Smith from first.	"He threw me a couple of fastballs early on and in the back of my mind I wanted to be ready for an off-speed pitch," said Hawpe, who leads the Rockies in hitting (.320) and RBIs (59).	Hawpe, Smith and Troy Tulowitzki homered for Colorado, and Huston Street (3-1) worked a perfect ninth for the win.	Brooks Conrad hit a two-run homer and finished with three hits for Atlanta, which led 7-3 after six innings.	"Nice to be able to have a game like I did, but bitter losing the game," Conrad said. "These are the hardest ones to take."	Colorado pushed across three runs in the seventh and tied it in the eighth. Dexter Fowler scored on left fielder Garret Anderson's error before Smith's two-run homer cut it to 7-6. Pinch-hitter Ryan Spilborghs doubled in the tying run.	"What really hurt us was walking Fowler with one out in the seventh with a four-run lead," Braves manager Bobby Cox said. "That led to everything. We had played a great game until then, and it got away from us."	Jason Hammel gave up five runs and nine hits over three innings for Colorado. It was his shortest outing since he went three innings against San Diego on April 27.	Chipper Jones hit a sacrifice fly and Conrad had an RBI triple in Atlanta's three-run first. Martin Prado gave the Braves a 4-0 lead with a run-scoring single in the second.	The Rockies chipped away at Atlanta's lead. Hawpe hit his 14th homer in the second, Atkins singled in a run in the third and Tulowitzki's leadoff homer in the fourth cut it to 5-3.	"To come back and win a ballgame like that, it was a fun game for us," Hawpe said.	Kris Medlen went four-plus innings for Atlanta, allowing three runs and six hits.	Game notes	 Rockies RHP Manuel Corpas (elbow) threw one inning for Triple-A Colorado Springs on Saturday and was scheduled to pitch again Sunday. The Rockies will examine him Wednesday. ... Rockies 1B Todd Helton sat out with flulike symptoms. ... The Braves activated INF Greg Norton (right ankle strain) from the 15-day disabled list and optioned OF Gregor Blanco to Triple-A Gwinnette. ... Rockies C Yorvit Torrealba left in the seventh inning with a strained right hamstring.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Derek Jeter doesn't think there's any reason to be alarmed.	The New York Yankees haven't fared well against two first-place teams in the American League. They are 0-8 against the rival Boston Red Sox, and now 2-4 against the Angels after being swept in Southern California.	John Lackey pitched seven solid innings and the Angels knocked around CC Sabathia to complete a sweep of New York with a 5-4 victory Sunday.	"You can't change it now. You have to make adjustments," Jeter said. "What happened against Boston is a long time ago. Here they beat us three games, but we battled."	So is it a setback?	"I don't think it is. It's over now," Jeter said.	Lackey (4-4) quickly worked through the Yankees lineup, allowing two runs on six hits. The Angels' ace struck out six in one of his most efficient starts of the season.	"He was spotting up very well today," said Mark Teixeira, Lackey's former teammate. "He made pitches when he needed to. John's been one of the best pitchers in baseball over the last six or seven years and he showed that today."	Sabathia (8-6) gave up five runs and struck out six in 6 2/3 innings against the Angels, who have won eight of their last nine meetings against the Yankees in Anaheim.	Brian Fuentes struck out Alex Rodriguez for the final out and earned his 26th save in 29 chances.	Sabathia, who was 5-1 with a 2.33 ERA away from Yankee Stadium entering the game, was solid through three innings. He got help from Rodriguez and Robinson Cano on two double plays to get out of the first and third, but he gave up four runs in the fourth.	Bobby Abreu and Howie Kendrick had RBI doubles and Brandon Wood and Robb Quinlan added RBI singles.	"We had some guys go down, but that just shows the depth of the organization," Chone Figgins said, referring to the loss of All-Star Torii Hunter (strained adductor) and slugger Vladimir Guerrero (strained muscle) to injuries. "Lackey showed why he's the ace of this team, and we got some clutch hitting and some really good defense. When you do stuff like that, you have the opportunity to win a lot games."	The Yankees finished 3-3 on their trip before the All-Star break and dropped to 5-15 this season against four teams in first at the break: Boston, Detroit, the Angels and Philadelphia.	"We don't like it, but we can't let this carry into Friday. We have four days off, we have a chance to regroup," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.	"You're going to go through those streaks, so let's end it on Friday and get back to what we're used to doing."	Los Angeles tacked on a run in the seventh when Maicer Izturis hit an RBI single.	New York tried to rally in the seventh and the eighth, but the Angels got out of bases-loaded jams twice.	Jorge Posada drove in runs in both innings to cut the Angels' lead to 5-4, and the Yankees looked like they could do some damage with none out in both situations.	But Los Angeles got stellar defensive plays to end both innings.	Lackey struck out Mark Teixeira and Chone Figgins turned a double play on Rodriguez to halt New York and get the crowd roaring in the seventh.	"Figgins' play was huge. It was a tough play, and he made an outstanding pick," Lackey said. "Then Kendry on the other end made another nice pick. It was awesome."	Darren Oliver fielded pinch-hitter Nick Swisher's line drive cleanly and turned it into a double play by getting Melky Cabrera out at first to end the eighth.	"It got there in a hurry. With a ball hit that hard, you're just reacting," Oliver said. "I'm happy it went in my glove. That's not the first time it's happened to me. When you go out there and throw strikes, you never know what can happen."	Lackey wasn't the only one impressed with Figgins' snag.	"Those are two of the most unbelievable double plays I've seen. It's just one of those things. The Angels were being the Angels," Rodriguez said.	Game notes	 Posada was supposed to catch two of three games against the Angels, but was subbed for Jose Molina to give the Yankees a better chance of slowing the Angels running game, Girardi said before the game. ... Rodriguez needs three home runs to tie Harmon Killebrew on the all-time home run list. ... Angels manager Mike Scioscia said he has yet to announce the pitching rotation for after the All-Star break. ... RHP Sergio Mitre pitched eight scoreless innings for Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre in a 3-2 win over Buffalo on Sunday and could take over as the Yankees' fifth starter after the break.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN FRANCISCO -- After struggling for the better part of the last month, the San Diego Padres were looking for any sort of positive sign to take into the All-Star break.	They finally got it.	Kevin Kouzmanoff and Eliezer Alfonzo hit three-run homers, Will Venable also homered and set a career-high with four hits, and the Padres beat the San Francisco Giants 10-4 to snap a season-high seven-game losing streak.	"You kind of get to the point where you have to prove you can do it, and we did today," winning pitcher Kevin Correia said. "We've got guys that can hit the ball. We just have to start doing it on a consistent basis."	San Diego scored six runs total its previous four games but had that many in the first three innings off San Francisco starter Barry Zito. The Padres finished with a season-high 10 runs, the last major league team to reach double digits in scoring this season.	Kouzmanoff and Alfonzo both homered off Zito, who was tagged with his team-leading ninth loss of the season. Luis Rodriguez added a pair of RBIs as San Diego had five different players drive in runs.	"It's a good win for the guys to be in a type of game like that because they know we're capable of that," Padres manager Bud Black said. "We play close games because we have the pitching, for the most part, to keep us in games. We just haven't scored at the rate like we did today."	The Padres, who were held without a hit by San Francisco lefty Jonathan Sanchez on Friday, broke out of their offensive slump early against Zito.	Kouzmanoff's homer came after Everth Cabrera and Venable -- son of former Giants outfielder Max Venable -- led off the game with singles. Alfonzo's three-run shot to left in the third drove in Venable and Kouzmanoff, who went a combined 8 for 10 with seven runs scored.	That was enough for Correia (6-7), who gave up three runs on eight hits in 5 2/3 innings in his second career start against his former team. The right-hander retired 11 of 12 during one stretch and got some help from his defense before tiring in the sixth.	He gave up a pair of one-out singles in the first but got out of the inning with a 5-4-3 double play, then held the Giants offense in check until John Bowker's solo homer in the fifth.	Correia, who pitched for San Francisco from 2003-08, didn't get the decision the first time he pitched against his former team earlier this season but earned the win this time.	"It wasn't that big a deal. It felt like another start, really," Correia said. "I'm comfortable pitching here and I've pitched against the Giants earlier this year. At this point I think I've earned the right to go back out there every five days. Obviously I didn't always earn it when I was with the Giants. I kind of pitched my way out of the rotation a couple times."	Correia ran into trouble in the sixth after giving up a two-out double to Bengie Molina and walking Nate Schierholtz. Edgar Renteria and Bowker followed with RBI singles to chase Correia before reliever Luke Gregerson struck out Juan Uribe to end the inning.	San Francisco added another run in the ninth off San Diego closer Heath Bell.	Zito (5-9) had yet another rocky outing. The left-hander retired the side in order just once and was booed heavily by the crowd after surrendering the three-run homer to Alfonzo.	The booing continued when Zito left the mound after giving up three hits in the fifth. All three runners eventually scored, marking the third time in Zito's career that he has given up nine runs or more in a game.	The loss prevented San Francisco from reaching the 50-win mark before the All-Star break for the first time since 2003.	Bowker hit his first homer of the season and his first since Sept. 24, 2008, in the fifth for the Giants, who still head into the All-Star break with the third best winning percentage in the National League behind the Los Angeles Dodgers and Philadelphia.	"I told the guys to enjoy the break because they should be proud of the way they played in the first half," manager Bruce Bochy said. "We need to keep the momentum going. It's going to take everybody to make this work."	Venable homered off San Francisco reliever Merkin Valdez in the eighth.	Game notes	 Kouzmanoff had four hits for the third time in his career ... Molina was back in San Francisco's lineup after taking two days off to be with his wife for the birth of the couple's first child, daughter Jayda Marie, who was born early Saturday afternoon. ... The Giants had been a season-high 11 games over .500 before the loss.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SEATTLE -- Chris Shelton made a nice impression on his new team and hurt his former club with one swing Sunday.	Shelton and Rob Johnson hit consecutive RBI singles with two out in the seventh inning, leading the Seattle Mariners to a 5-3 win over the Texas Rangers.	Shelton hit .216 in 41 games with the Rangers last season and agreed to a minor league deal with the Mariners in December. He batted .319 with 12 homers and 64 RBIs for Triple-A Tacoma before he was promoted Wednesday.	He grounded out in Friday's 6-4 loss to Texas in his only at-bat before coming up big Sunday in another pinch-hit appearance.	"I don't want to say you get used to it but just as long as you are prepared when you get called, that's the biggest thing," Shelton said of pinch hitting. "I was ready ... and I put a good swing on it today."	All-Star Ichiro Suzuki had two hits and drove in a run for the Mariners, raising his batting average to .362 and extending his hitting streak to 11 games.	Hank Blalock and Nelson Cruz homered for the Rangers. Cruz will participate in the Home Run Derby Monday night in St. Louis.	Derek Holland and Darren O'Day (2-1) combined to retire the first two batters in the Seattle seventh, but Ken Griffey Jr. followed with the first of four straight singles for the Mariners. C.J. Wilson replaced O'Day after Franklin Gutierrez's hit put runners on first and second.	Shelton then lifted a full-count pitch just over shortstop Elvis Andrus, driving in pinch-runner Josh Wilson. Johnson hit Wilson's next pitch to the same spot to score Gutierrez.	"C.J. makes a pitch on Shelton. He catches it at the end of the bat and pushes it over," Texas manager Ron Washington said. "Then Johnson gets another. It doesn't matter how you get the hits. They got them and plated two runs."	Miguel Batista (6-3) pitched 1 1/3 innings to get the win and David Aardsma got three outs for his 20th save in 22 chances.	Seattle won three of four against the Rangers to improve to 46-42 heading into the All-Star break. They were 37-58 at the break last season.	"If we were winning one way, it would be hard to say we are a good team," Suzuki said through an interpreter. "But with so many people contributing, it shows that we are a good team."	Erik Bedard walked four in 5 2/3 innings, but limited Texas to two runs and three hits. The left-hander got two key double plays to help him get out of trouble.	Rangers starter Dustin Nippert wasn't as fortunate, failing to make it out of the fourth inning. Holland entered after Ronny Cedeno's single loaded the bases with two out. Suzuki made it 2-0 with an infield hit and Russell Branyan walked with the bases loaded to force in another run.	The Rangers tied it in the sixth. Blalock hit a two-run drive off Bedard for his 19th homer and Cruz hit Batista's first pitch for his 22nd of the season.	Game notes	 Seattle 3B Adrian Beltre, who had shoulder surgery June 30, is at least another five weeks away. "The reports are that its gone real well," manager Don Wakamatsu said. "We're almost having to slow him down." ... For the Mariners, Garrett Olson (3-2) will lead off the second-half rotation Thursday followed by Felix Hernandez (9-3), Jarrod Washburn (6-6) and Bedard (5-2). ... Rangers SS Omar Vizquel, who lives in the Seattle area in the offseason, surprised his coaches and teammates by bringing his three kangaroos into the clubhouse before the game. ... The Rangers' rotation to open the second half, beginning Friday, will be: Vicente Padilla (7-4), Scott Feldman (8-2), Tommy Hunter (1-1) and Kevin Millwood 8-7).	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PHOENIX -- Josh Johnson heads to his first All-Star game a winner, and through 90 games so are his Florida Marlins.	Johnson pitched into the seventh inning and the Marlins beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 8-1 Sunday for a split of their four-game series.	"He is a really good pitcher and he kind of put their team on his back and took control of that game," Arizona manager A.J. Hinch said. "It's as simple as that."	Johnson (8-2) allowed a run and seven hits -- all singles -- in 6 2/3 innings, striking out seven and walking two in his first victory in four starts. He lowered his ERA to 2.74.	"I felt good out there, which is the key for me," he said. "I threw a lot of good sliders. Not very many balls were hit very hard. It was just one of those days when balls seemed to keep falling but I just wanted to bear down and do whatever I could to stop it."	Cody Ross drove in three runs with a pair of doubles, Jeremy Hermida hit a two-run homer off the right-field foul pole and NL batting leader Hanley Ramirez singled three times as the Marlins (46-44) entered the All-Star break two games above .500. Florida remained four games back of NL East-leading Philadelphia.	"If you would have told me this on April 2, I would have said 'Yeah, I'll take it,'" manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "But now it's July 12 and you want more. You want to win more."	Ross already was thinking about the Marlins' four-game series against the Phillies in Miami after the break.	"Four games right now is a lot," he said of Philadelphia's division lead, "but we've got them coming in the beginning of the second half. I don't want to think about it too much right now. I want to enjoy my All-Star break, but we've got to start getting serious and we've got to take those games."	The Diamondbacks won seven of nine going into the break and were 5-2 on the homestand.	"It would have been great to win three out of four in this series for our third series win in a row," Hinch said, "but I thought we had a really good homestand -- to play better at home, which has been difficult for us, just to play better baseball."	Arizona left-hander Doug Davis (4-9), a leading candidate to be traded before the July 31 deadline, matched his shortest outing of the season at four innings, giving up five runs.	After two quick outs, the Marlins scored three times in the first. Ramirez singled and came home on Jorge Cantu's single. Dan Uggla walked and both runners scored on Ross' towering double off the overhang some 400 feet away in center field.	Emilio Bonifacio beat out an infield single with one out in the fourth, then Hermida fouled off three pitches before hitting Davis' 3-2 delivery high off the foul pole above the Florida bullpen for his 10th homer.	Ross doubled in another run in the seventh.	Brian Sanches relieved Johnson with runners at first and second, and Drew ended the shutout with his third single of the day. Justin Upton struck out for the third time to end the inning.	Game notes	 Hinch moved back Dan Haren's next scheduled start to next Sunday to give the Diamondbacks ace four days' rest after his anticipated appearance in the All-Star Game. ... A woman sitting in the second row near the plate was hit in the face by a Cantu foul ball in the first inning. Her head was wrapped in bandages and she was carried out on a stretcher. ... Arizona slugger Mark Reynolds, the majors' runaway strikeout leader with 123, fanned three times, went 0 for 4, committed an error that led to two unearned runs and finished the homestand 3 for 24. ... Johnson is 2-1 with a 1.35 ERA in three career starts against Arizona.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

CHICAGO -- Ryan Ludwick more than made up for Albert Pujols' rare bad game.	Ludwick hit a pair of two-run homers, Adam Wainwright pitched eight strong innings and the St. Louis Cardinals salvaged a split by beating the Chicago Cubs 4-2 in the nightcap of Sunday's doubleheader.	Wainwright improved to 3-0 against the Cubs this season and St. Louis leads the NL-Central by 2½ games heading into the All-Star break. Chicago (43-43) is .500, 3½ games out.	Ludwick also had a double in the eighth to finish the doubleheader 5 for 8 with four RBIs and four extra base hits. He is batting .455 during a nine-game hitting streak. Pujols was 1 for 8 with two RBIs in the doubleheader, including 0 for 4 in the nightcap.	With Ludwick heating up, Pujols, who leads the majors in home runs and RBIs, doesn't need to supply all the muscle for the Cardinals.	"I went through a huge rut. One of the biggest ruts I've ever been through. In the middle of the rut I really started pressing bad and then I just really tried to start having good at-bats and not worrying about results," said Ludwick, who had an 0 for 14 skid in June.	In the opener, Carlos Zambrano homered for the third time this season and earned a win with six solid innings as the Cubs beat the Cardinals 7-3.	The second game featured some unusual maneuvering by Cubs manager Lou Piniella in the ninth inning. With no outs and the bases loaded, Piniella moved left-handed reliever Sean Marshall to left for one batter and moved him back to the mound to face left-handed hitter Skip Schumaker.	"We did what we had to do to try to keep the game in check and it worked," said Piniella.	Marshall said he was surprised by Piniella's move.	"A little bit, then when he said it, it made sense because I knew who was coming up for the next two hitters. It was kind of funny to watch [Aaron] Heilman pitch because he was throwing so many pitches inside because if he does hit it will it will be right at me and hopefully I can make a play and throw someone out," said Marshall, who added the fans in the bleachers were chanting "We are Marshall."	Cardinals manager Tony La Russa was so impressed by Piniella's move he stopped Cubs first base coach Matt Sinatro to pass on his message.	"I stopped Sinatro and said you tell Lou that was a classic. It was fun to be a part of it no matter how it turns out. It takes creativity and it takes guts. Lou showed both of them. That was fun actually. It was terrific," said La Russa.	The right-handed Heilman struck out Brendan Ryan with the bases loaded and Marshall in left. Schumaker was pinch-hit for by Jarrett Hoffpauir, and Marshall struck out him. Left fielder Reed Johnson made a diving catch, though replays showed he appeared catch the ball on a short-hop, on Colby Rasmus' fly to end the inning.	Cardinals closer Ryan Franklin struck out the side in the ninth for his 21st save in 22 chances.	Cubs starter Randy Wells (4-4) handled Pujols in the second game, but couldn't get out Ludwick. Wells got Pujols to hit into a double play with runners on first and second in the first inning, and Ludwick followed with a two-run shot to center.	Wainwright (10-5) allowed two runs and scattered seven hits. He struck out five and walked three as the Cardinals split the four-game series.	Wells gave up a leadoff single to Rasmus in the sixth inning. Pujols followed with a groundout to third, but Ludwick tagged Wells again to put the Cardinals up 4-1. It was Ludwick's 15th of the season and his second multihomer game of the season.	Wells, who had won his last four decisions, gave up four runs on seven hits in seven innings.	The Cubs got a run off Wainwright in the first inning on Derrek Lee's RBI single. Milton Bradley hit a two-out RBI double in the sixth.	"If we swing the bats and stay healthy we have a really good chance of winning the division. We have been through a lot, if we don't we'll see what happens. I'm curious myself believe it or not," Piniella said.	In the first game, Zambrano homered for the 19th time in his career, tops in franchise history for pitchers.	"My job is to pitch. That's the thing I know best," he said. "If they figure out how to pitch to me every day I don't think I would hit that many home runs."	Micah Hoffpauir had a three-run homer for the Cubs and Zambrano (5-4) allowed three runs and five hits.	St. Louis starter Kyle Lohse (4-5), who was activated from the 15-day disabled list before the game, struggled in his first appearance since leaving an outing against Cincinnati on June 3 because of a strained right forearm.	"Hoffpauir's first pitch [was] a curve," said Lohse, who allowed four runs and eight hits in five innings. "It wasn't a bad pitch but he jumped all over it. As the game went on I pitched pretty well."	Game notes	 In the fifth inning of Game 2, with Wainwright at first base, Ryan hit into what appeared to be a doubleplay, but Wainwright deflected the ball with his right hand on the turn by Theriot. Wainwright did not show any signs of an injury to his hand. ... Cardinals third base coach Jose Oquendo missed the doubleheader to manage the World Team in the Futures Game in St. Louis. Joe Pettini took his place at third.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

ATLANTA -- Chipper Jones says the Atlanta Braves should have had more than one All-Star this year.	He says Rafael Soriano proved again against the New York Mets that he is closing games like a star.	Jones drove in the go-ahead run in the seventh inning and Soriano capped three scoreless innings by Atlanta's bullpen as the Braves beat the Mets 5-3 on Thursday night.	"He's been automatic, every time out," Jones, a six-time All-Star, said of Soriano. "He should have been an All-Star. I can't believe he didn't make it."	Jones' two-out fielding error in the ninth on Brian Schneider's grounder to third kept Soriano from his seventh 1-2-3 inning in his last nine appearances. He lowered his ERA to 1.44 and has 13 saves in 14 chances.	Soriano struck out pinch-hitter Jeremy Reed to end the game with a 96 mph fastball.	Manny Acosta (1-0), Peter Moylan and Soriano combined to give up only one hit in three scoreless innings.	Catcher Brian McCann was the Braves' only All-Star in Tuesday night's game.	The Braves broke a 3-3 tie against the New York bullpen, which gave up two runs in two innings.	Pedro Feliciano (2-3) walked pinch-hitter Brooks Conrad, who advanced to third on Martin Prado's hit-and-run single to left off Bobby Parnell. Jones, a .330 career hitter against the Mets, drove in Conrad with a single to right off Parnell to give the Braves a 4-3 lead.	"You expect Chipper to deliver every time," Braves manager Bobby Cox said.	The win left the Braves (44-45) one game under .500 and 1 1/2 games ahead of the fourth-place Mets (42-46) in the NL East.	"This is a big series," Jones said. "It's a chance for us to play a good team. They're in our rearview mirror now. Hopefully we keep them there. You certainly want to get the second half kicked off on the right foot, and tonight was a good one."	Pinch-hitter Greg Norton added a run-scoring single off Pat Misch, New York's third reliever, in the eighth.	Mets manager Jerry Manuel acknowledged the team's first series after the All-Star break "is huge for us."	"We wanted to come out of the gate and play well," Manuel said.	"We didn't beat ourselves. We got a good effort from [Oliver] Perez. Hopefully, this will be a springboard for the rest of our starting pitchers."	Atlanta's Derek Lowe and Perez each gave up five hits and three runs in six innings. Perez walked four and struck out six, while Lowe walked three and struck out two.	Jeff Francoeur was 0 for 4 with an RBI in his return to Atlanta following Friday's trade to the Mets. He tipped his cap in response to the cheers from fans in right field in the first inning and received a loud ovation before lining into a double play in his first at-bat.	"It was a little bit of a distraction," Francoeur said of his return. "It was a different experience. It was fun."	Ryan Church, who came to the Braves in the trade, did not start. He came in the game in the eighth as a pinch-runner and defensive replacement for Garret Anderson, who had three hits, including a homer.	The Braves took a 2-0 lead in the second on back-to-back homers by Yunel Escobar and Anderson.	The Mets scored three runs in the fourth. Luis Castillo, David Wright and Gary Sheffield opened the inning with three straight singles to drive in the first run. Francoeur's groundout drove in Wright, and David Murphy added a run-scoring double.	Matt Diaz tied the game with a two-out double in the fourth. McCann, who singled, scored from first on a headfirst slide with his hand touching the plate just before the tag from Schneider.	"That's probably the first run I've ever scored on a double down the left-field line," McCann said. "I felt like if I slid feet first he'd have got me."	Game notes	 The Mets selected the contract of IF Angel Berroa from Triple-A Buffalo before the game. Berroa, 31, was signed as a minor league free agent on Saturday after he was designated for assignment by the Yankees on June 24. ... Escobar and Anderson hit the Braves' first back-to-back homers this season. ... Norton snapped an 0-for-11 slump with his first hit since June 5.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

CLEVELAND -- Cliff Lee finally got just a little run support. It was enough for the reigning AL Cy Young Award winner.	Lee won for the first time in more than a month, allowing one run in his second complete game of the season to give the Cleveland Indians a 4-1 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Thursday night.	"He showed why he was the Cy Young winner last year," Seattle manager Don Wakamatsu said. "He never kept anything in the middle of the plate. We had a hit every inning, which is hard to do, but we couldn't capitalize on it and put anything together."	Lee (5-9) hadn't won since a three-hit shutout against St. Louis on June 14, when he took a no-hitter into the eighth inning. He had lost three straight starts, thanks mostly to a lack of run support. The Indians have scored three runs or less in 11 of Lee's 20 starts.	"We got some runs early," Lee said. "We got a nice lead and I got ahead in the count. That's how you win games."	Lee allowed nine hits, including Ronny Cedeno's solo homer in the fifth inning. He also struck out six and didn't walk a batter. Even after Kenji Johjima singled with two out in the ninth for his third hit of the game Indians manager Eric Wedge gave no thought to removing Lee, who struck out Chris Woodward to end it.	"It was Cliff's game," Wedge said. "He was in control."	The Mariners stranded seven, but didn't get a runner past second base other than on Cedeno's home run.	"When people are on base, that's where you have to bear down and get out of it," said Lee, who is 8-1 with a 3.35 ERA in 12 career appearances against Seattle.	Grady Sizemore, batting leadoff for the first time since May 16, had two hits and drove in a run. He also banged into the center field wall after catching Cedeno's fly ball in the third inning.	"There were some unbelievable defensive plays behind me," Lee said.	Besides Sizemore's catch, Lee was also helped by a dazzling double play in the seventh. Shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera fielded Cedeno's ground ball in front of second base and made a behind-the-back flip to Jamey Carroll, who threw to first.	"I don't think anyone saw the behind-the-back throw," Wedge said. "I'm glad Jamey Carroll saw it. It would have hit him right in the chest."	Garrett Olson (3-3) allowed three runs in 2 2/3 innings in his first start since July 4 for the Mariners, who made four errors.	Ichiro Suzuki extended his hitting streak to 12 games with a third-inning single, but it was a sloppy first game after the All-Star break for the Mariners. First baseman Russell Branyan committed two errors while pitcher Chris Jakubauskas and Woodward, the third baseman, had one each.	"The guys had three days off. The timing just wasn't there," Wakamatsu said.	Sizemore singled to lead off the first and scored on Cabrera's double. Sizemore, who was on the disabled list for three weeks with a sore elbow, has been batting in the second spot.	An error by Branyan helped the Indians in the second. Woodward fielded Ben Francisco's ground ball, but Branyan failed to catch the ball because the sun that was setting on the other side of the field got in his eyes. Francisco was awarded second when the ball went into the stands. Branyan went to the dugout for a pair of sunglasses.	Carroll's double scored Francisco. Sizmore's bloop single to right made it 3-0. Jhonny Peralta added an RBI single in the fifth.	Game notes	 The Mariners opened a seven-game road trip Thursday. ... 3B Adrian Beltre rejoined Seattle after having shoulder surgery July 1 to remove a spur. He could start taking ground balls next week, but the team doesn't expect to have him back for another month ... Mariners DH Mike Sweeney (back spasms) took early batting practice and is on pace to be activated July 21, when he is eligible to come off the DL. ... Indians manager Eric Wedge flipped C Victor Martinez and OF Shin-Soo Choo in the batting order. Martinez was moved to cleanup while Choo batted third. ... Choo was caught stealing for the first time this season in the third. He had been 13 for 13 in stolen base attempts. ... RHP Fausto Carmona, Cleveland's No. 2 starter when the season began, allowed two runs in seven innings for Triple-A Columbus against Syracuse. Carmona could be called up to start on July 25.

WASHINGTON -- Minimal offense, two errors that led to three unearned runs, a costly pickoff in the eighth inning with the potential tying run at the plate: The dawn of the Jim Riggleman era looked suspiciously like the kind of spotty play that got Manny Acta fired as manager of the Washington Nationals.	Rich Harden allowed three hits over six innings, Derrek Lee homered and the Chicago Cubs beat Washington 6-2 on Thursday night, spoiling Riggleman's debut as the Nationals' interim manager.	"Our guys played hard. I thought we played very well for seven innings and then it got away from us. ... There's really not a whole lot to feel good about," Riggleman said. "But I feel like we're going to turn this thing around."	Harden (6-6), who had won only one of his previous seven starts, improved to 4-1 on the road. He allowed an unearned run, walked none and struck out seven, including Adam Dunn three times.	"It's nice to have a couple of days off and kind of regroup," Harden said of the All-Star break. "[It] kind of helps put things behind you, put the first half behind you. There are a lot of games left. It's almost like you're starting over."	A managerial change did little to ignite the Nationals, who have dropped seven of eight and own the majors' worst record at 26-62. Riggleman, who previously managed the Cubs, San Diego and Seattle, replaced Acta on Monday after serving as his bench coach the first half of the season.	Nationals catcher Josh Bard wouldn't fault what he called "aggressive" errors and preached patience in wake of the leadership switch.	"There's positives to take out of it but at the end of the day we're not here to just get positives," Bard said. "They're paying us stinking boatloads of money to go out there and win baseball games and we've got to be better. We're not going to make this ship right in three hours."	Cubs manager Lou Piniella wasn't sure what to expect out of the Nationals in wake of Riggleman's ascension.	"You never know. You don't like to see anybody get fired. Riggleman's ... an experienced guy [but] sometimes it takes a while," Piniella said.	Lee had three hits and Ryan Theriot drove in two runs for the Cubs, who have won three of four.	"You just want to come out on a good foot, [it] really wasn't much of a break. ... We were playing pretty good when we went into it," Theriot said. "Hopefully, we can continue it."	Ryan Zimmerman hit his 15th homer for Washington, a ninth-inning solo shot off Kevin Gregg.	Chicago went up 1-0 in the third on an unearned run. Koyie Hill reached second on third baseman Zimmerman's throwing error, moved to third on Harden's sacrifice and scored on Theriot's two-out double to left.	"I think sometimes, Ryan gets caught between whether he's going to pick it up and fire or take another step and throw it on the run," Riggleman said of Zimmerman's error, his team-high 13th. "I think we saw a little bit of in-between there, and it didn't come out of his hand good."	Lee's 18th homer, a solo shot with one out in the sixth off a 3-2 fastball from John Lannan, made it 2-0.	The Nationals cut the lead in half in the bottom of the inning on an RBI groundout by Nick Johnson.	An RBI single by Reed Johnson restored the Cubs' two-run lead in the seventh and knocked Lannan from the game.	Lannan (6-7) gave up three runs -- two earned -- and seven hits over 6 2/3 innings.	Washington had the potential tying run up in the eighth after Morgan drew a two-out walk. But Carlos Marmol picked off Morgan with Johnson hitting and the Cubs added three insurance runs in the ninth.	Game notes	 Washington LHP Scott Olsen has been scratched from Saturday's scheduled start because of back muscle tightness and will be replaced by RHP Craig Stammen. ... Before the game, the Nationals recalled RHP Garrett Mock from Triple-A Syracuse. Mock will start Sunday. ... The Cubs on Thursday signed LHP B.J.
