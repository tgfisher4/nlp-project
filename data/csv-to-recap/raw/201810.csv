MILWAUKEE --  The high-five at the plate from Brandon Woodruff nearly took out Lorenzo Cain.	It's not often that reliever hits a home run.	Batting left-handed. Off lefty Clayton Kershaw. In the playoffs.	Woodruff stunned the ace with an early home run and Milwaukee's normally shutdown bullpen held on -- barely -- as the Brewers beat the sloppy Los Angeles Dodgers 6-5 Friday night in Game 1 of the NL Championship Series.	Hard-throwing Josh Hader and the Brewers earned their 12th straight win, one shy of the franchise record set to open the 1987 season.	Woodruff, of all people, had the momentum-swinging hit.	"It's something obviously coming into the day, you don't know in your wildest dreams that's going to happen," he said.	It was the first time in postseason history that a pitcher homered in a lefty vs. lefty matchup. Woodruff was understandably was pumped as he rounded the bases.	"He was fired up when he came home. He nearly broke my arm," Cain said.	The Dodgers scored three times in the eighth to make it 6-4, then nearly tied it in the ninth. Chris Taylor hit an RBI triple off Cain's glove in deep center field with two outs before Corey Knebel fanned Justin Turner to end it.	Game 2 is Saturday at Miller Park, with Wade Miley pitching for the Brewers against Hyun-Jin Ryu.	The Dodgers did some damage against the Brewers' bullpen. Milwaukee used seven pitchers, including three scoreless innings from Hader. Woodruff threw two perfect innings and got the win.	"But for us to get a look at these guys out of the `pen in a seven-game series, I think that's a good thing," manager Dave Roberts said.	Manny Machado homered and drove in three runs for Los Angeles. The Dodgers committed four errors, including two by catcher Yasmani Grandal, who also had two passed balls.	NERVOUS MOMENTS	Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell's pitching-by-committee strategy continued to be a hit, at least until the late innings.	Finally, the hard-throwing Knebel restored order by striking out Turner. Knebel walked Joc Pederson with two outs before Taylor's long drive.	"It's the postseason and anything can happen, you saw right there. It was a good feeling for it to go our way right there at the end," Knebel said.	STUNNING HOMER	After starter Gio Gonzalez went two innings, nicked by Machado's home run, Woodruff entered in the top of the third. In the bottom half, Woodruff made a sudden impact -- with his bat.	Woodruff became just the third relief pitcher to homer in the postseason, tagging a three-time NL Cy Young Award winner for a tying solo drive. Woodruff pumped both arms as he rounded first base, while Kershaw turned away and looked down at the ground.	"I knew he could swing the bat a little bit, for sure," Kershaw said. "I didn't know he could do that, but I knew he could hit a little bit."	Woodruff was a career 4 for 22 (.222) hitter before connecting. He had one previous homer, in July against Pittsburgh's Nick Kingham.	DODGER BLUES	Kershaw was chased before he could retire a batter in the fourth inning.	It was another miserable October night for the lefty, whose regular-season brilliance has often disappeared in the postseason.	And it wasn't even Christian Yelich and the Brewers' stars who got to him. Hernan Perez hit a sacrifice fly later in the third, and pinch-hitter Domingo Santana had a two-run single in the fourth for a 4-1 lead that chased Kershaw from the mound with nobody out.	It was the shortest postseason start of Kershaw's career. He had a 4.65 ERA in 10 career appearances, including seven starts, going into Friday.	That ERA went up after allowing six hits and five runs -- four earned -- in three-plus innings.	"The errors affected the game. But as far as Clayton, I just think it was poor execution," Roberts said.	Jesus Aguilar added a solo home run in the seventh for the Brewers, his second of the postseason. Cain went 3 for 5 and scored a run.	BURGER TIME	Eat up, Milwaukee.	This late-season run earned Brewers fans a free burger at an area restaurant chain.	George Webb Restaurants has a long-standing promotion to give away a free burger whenever the Brewers win 12 straight.	It's time to dine after a dozen.	Save the date: October 18, George Webb announced after the game . Save one for reliever Jeremy Jeffress, too.	"Honestly, as long as you put some mayo on it I'm good with it," he said.	George Webb also paid up in 1987.	UP NEXT	It's another all left-handed pitching matchup in Game 2. Ryu pitched seven shutout innings, striking out seven and allowing for hits, in the Dodgers' Game 1 victory over the Braves in the Division Series. Ryu is 2-0 with a 1.96 ERA in four career postseason starts. Miley is making his second start of the postseason, going 4 2/3 innings in the Brewers' Division Series-clinching victory over Colorado on Sunday. He is 4-5 with a 3.55 ERA in 15 career games against the Dodgers.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

MILWAUKEE --  Justin Turner and the Los Angeles Dodgers know all about performing in the postseason.	Backed into a tough spot Saturday, the red-headed slugger delivered once again.	Shut down for most of the afternoon, Los Angeles staged another late rally and Turner hit a two-run homer in the eighth inning to lift the Dodgers over the Milwaukee Brewers for a 4-3 victory that evened the NL Championship Series at a game apiece.	The high-powered Dodgers had two measly singles off Wade Miley before breaking through against one of baseball's best bullpens. After forcing the Brewers to use six relievers in Milwaukee's 6-5 victory Friday night, the NL West champions put that extended look to good use in Game 2, especially against faltering All-Star Jeremy Jeffress.	"As long as we have outs left, we know we're in the game," Turner said.	Milwaukee wasted a terrific performance by Miley in its first loss in three weeks, ending a 12-game winning streak that produced free burgers for its fans as part of a promotion by a local restaurant chain. Orlando Arcia and Travis Shaw homered, and Lorenzo Cain robbed David Freese of a two-run drive with a leaping grab over the wall in center .	Miley pitched 5 2/3 scoreless innings in his second career playoff start and had two hits in his first multihit game since 2014.	"We were in really good shape with the effort that Wade gave us," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. "He pitched beautifully."	The best-of-seven series moves to Dodger Stadium for Game 3 on Monday night. Walker Buehler pitches for Los Angeles and Jhoulys Chacin gets the ball for Milwaukee.	Miley handed a 2-0 lead over to his bullpen and Shaw tacked on a solo drive in the sixth , delighting a yellow towel-waving crowd of 43,905 at Miller Park. But that was the last run for the Brewers, and the Dodgers finished off their rally this time around after nearly taking Game 1.	Cody Bellinger got Los Angeles on the board with an RBI single in the seventh, chasing Corbin Burnes and stopping an 0-for-15 slide in the playoffs that landed him on the bench at the start of the game. Austin Barnes forced in another run with a bases-loaded walk off Jeffress, but the right-hander escaped when pinch-hitter Yasmani Grandal bounced into a double play.	The Dodgers went right back to work in the eighth. Chris Taylor reached on a leadoff single before Turner hit a long drive to left off Jeffress, admiring the ball with his bat pointed toward the sky before rounding the bases and participating in several different celebrations with his giddy teammates on his way to the dugout.	Turner bounced back after striking out a career-worst four times in Game 1.	"It felt good," Turner said. "I knew it was a homer, and it's cool to run around the bases and see all your teammates going crazy, jumping up and down waiting for you."	Jeffress also struggled in Game 1, allowing two hits while only recording one out. He was charged with two runs and six hits in 3 1/3 innings in three appearances in the Division Series against Colorado, including a blown save in the opener.	"It's intense baseball games, man," Jeffress said. "They're going to be like this for the rest of the postseason. We're going to battle, they're going to battle. Just be ready."	Los Angeles has scored eight runs against Milwaukee's bullpen, all in the seventh inning or later.	"The more you face the relievers, the easier it's going to get," Bellinger said.	It was Turner's seventh career playoff homer. He was co-MVP of the NLCS last year with Taylor when Los Angeles made it to the World Series for the first time since 1988.	The Dodgers are making their sixth straight appearance in the playoffs while the upstart Brewers are in the postseason for the first time since 2011. That advantage in experience seemed to pay off -- especially when Turner came up with the big blow.	"He personifies everything that I believe in as a baseball player, as a professional. ... He's the glue for our club," manager Dave Roberts said.	Save for Yasiel Puig snapping his bat over his leg after striking out swinging with the bases loaded in the seventh, Los Angeles stayed steady as Milwaukee tried to hold on. Pedro Baez got four outs for the win, and Kenley Jansen worked the ninth for the save. Jansen broke NL MVP-favorite Christian Yelich's bat for a groundout with a runner on second for the final out.	REMEMBER WHEN	Former major league slugger Prince Fielder threw out a ceremonial first pitch. Fielder said Counsell helped him a lot when they played together in Milwaukee.	"There was one time I was thinking about bunting and he told me if I bunt, he'll punch me in the face," a chuckling Fielder said.	UP NEXT	Chacin had his worst start of the season at Los Angeles on Aug. 2, allowing nine runs, eight earned, and five hits in 4 1/3 innings in a 21-5 loss. The veteran right-hander is 5-5 with a 4.96 ERA in 12 career starts at Dodger Stadium. Buehler is making his second career start against Milwaukee. The rookie right-hander tossed seven innings of five-hit ball in a 1-0 loss to the visiting Brewers on July 31.	---	Jay Cohen can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/jcohenap	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

BOSTON --  With temperatures dipping into the 40s, numbing their fingertips as they tried to grip the baseball, Justin Verlander and Chris Sale both struggled to get the ball over the plate.	Verlander recovered quickly.	Sale never did.	After walking in one run and giving up the tying score on a wild pitch, Verlander struck out Andrew Benintendi on a contested called third strike, and the Houston Astros pulled away to beat the Boston Red Sox 7-2 on Saturday night in the AL Championship Series opener.	The teams combined for just eight hits, but Red Sox pitchers walked 10 and hit three batters. Verlander walked four -- tying a career postseason high, and more than he had in any outing in the regular season this year. Three of them and one of his two wild pitches came in a fifth inning that almost chased him from the game.	"That inning I had kind of lost my feel a bit. Couldn't point a finger to why," Verlander said. "The tying run scoring was a little disappointing. ... But once that happens, then you've got to reset and not relinquish the lead."	Verlander pitched six innings of two-hit ball , and Carlos Correa fisted a single into left field to break a sixth-inning tie. Josh Reddick hit a solo homer to lead off the ninth , and Yuli Gurriel curled a three-run shot into the front row beyond the Pesky Pole to give the defending World Series champions their fifth straight postseason victory.	Game 2 of the best-of-seven series is Sunday night, with Boston left-hander David Price trying to end his postseason skid against Astros righty Gerrit Cole. Cora has expressed confidence in Price, a Cy Young Award winner who is 0-9 in 10 postseason starts, and the 108-win Red Sox will need him to be better than Sale was in the opener.	"We'll see tomorrow," Boston catcher Sandy Leon said.	In a rematch of last year's Division Series opener, when the Astros hit back-to-back homers in the first inning and pounded Sale for seven runs in all, Verlander improved to 13-2 in the AL playoffs. Houston only got one hit off of Sale, but he loaded the bases with two outs in the second on two walks and a hit batter before reigning World Series MVP George Springer singled in two runs past the glove of third baseman Eduardo Nunez , who slipped as he stretched for the ball.	"Anytime you get two quick outs then you load up the bases and give them two runs, that's not what you're looking for this time of year," Sale said. "I just went out there and lost it for a little bit. I felt like I was battling myself for a little bit. I was trying to limit the damage and get out there as quick as we can."	The Red Sox went down in order in the second, third and fourth innings before awakening the shivering, sold-out Fenway crowd in the fifth with Steve Pearce's single -- just their second hit in the game -- and two walks. Verlander walked a third batter in a row, forcing in a run.	Mookie Betts hit a hard grounder, and third baseman Alex Bregman threw home for the force and the second out . With Jackie Bradley Jr. dancing on third base, Verlander put a 1-2 curveball in the dirt and past catcher Martin Maldonado , allowing the runners to advance and tying the game 2-2.	Andrew Benintendi worked the count full before looking at a 3-2 pitch that appeared to catch the edge of the zone for the third out.	"You can look at it two ways," Red Sox right fielder Mookie Betts said. "They pitched their way out of it, but we didn't hit our way into it."	Benintendi was less philosophical. He slammed down his helmet and bat down and jawed with plate umpire James Hoye before Red Sox coaches ran in to get between them.	Cora continued the argument and was ejected ; he handed over his lineup card to bench coach Ron Roenicke and headed down the tunnel.	"I guess Verlander executed his pitch, and he called it a strike," Cora said. "Andrew didn't agree. I didn't agree. It's a big pitch right there. It's ball four, bases loaded. ... Most likely Verlander comes out of the game.	"But you can't argue balls and strikes," he said. "And I did."	Houston took advantage of another hit batter in the sixth -- this one by reliever Joe Kelly -- and Nunez's fielding error on Gurriel's grounder to take a 3-2 lead. Reddick and Gurriel homered off Brandon Workman.	Verlander was charged with two runs and four walks while striking out six. He has allowed only nine hits in his past four postseason starts, matching Don Larsen (1955-57) as the only pitchers to allow nine hits over a span of four-postseason starts, according to STATS.	"The tying run scoring was a little disappointing," Verlander said. "But once that happens, then you've got to reset and not relinquish the lead."	SALE'S STRUGGLES	Sale, who took the mound without long sleeves on the chilly night, left after the fourth inning -- his only 1-2-3 inning of the game -- having thrown 86 pitches. Sale gave up two runs, one hit, four walks and a hit batter , and his average fastball velocity of 92 mph was down 3 mph from the Division Series.	"I still like our chances," he said. "We've got D.P. on the mound and we got a bunch of guys in here that are fired up over tonight. We're not gonna hang our heads in the locker room. We're not gonna give up. This is the time when we kick in gear and start fighting."	WEST HIT	Boston catcher Christian Vazquez hit second-base umpire Joe West on his right shoulder with a throw when Jake Marisnick stole second in the eighth.	UP NEXT	Price, 16-7 in this year's regular season, has two postseason wins in relief in his career. Cora insisted that he had faith in Price, and he told the 2012 AL Cy Young winner as much after the Red Sox eliminated the Yankees in the previous round.	"Alex told me before we even got off the field that night" that he would get another start, Price said before the game. "So for him to tell me before we even took our jerseys off to put on our postseason shirts that we get when we win, that was special."	Cole was 15-5 with a 2.88 ERA in the regular season.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

BOSTON --  David Price went home a winner in a postseason start for the first time in his career.	That, he insisted, is all he ever cared about.	"This is bigger than David Price," he said on Sunday night. "This isn't about me. This is about the Boston Red Sox."	Price was good enough, the Red Sox relievers were even better, and Jackie Bradley Jr. delivered a go-ahead, three-run double off the Green Monster to lead Boston to a 7-5 victory over the Houston Astros and tie the AL Championship Series at one game apiece.	Price fell one out short of qualifying for the win, which would have been his first in 11 postseason starts. But it was the first time his team had won a playoff game he started, snapping a record run of October futility.	"It's baby steps," said Price, who entered the night 0-9 in 10 career playoff starts. "I expect myself to be great in big moments, and I haven't done that thus far in my career. But I came here to win, period. I came here to win a World Series, and to do it multiple times. And that's what I'm about."	Game 3 is Tuesday in Houston, followed by two more at Minute Maid Park and a chance for the defending World Series champions to clinch a second straight AL pennant at home. Marwin Gonzalez homered for the Astros, who had won five straight postseason games dating to Game 7 of the 2017 Series.	"We came here and won a game, and they played well tonight," Houston third baseman Alex Bregman said. "It's going to be a fun series, so we're looking forward to going back home."	Price was spotted a two-run lead in the first inning and then fell behind 4-2 before Bradley clanged one off the left-field wall that Gonzalez chased helplessly as it bounced back toward the infield.	Price left leading 5-4 with two on with two out in the fifth before Matt Barnes struck out Gonzalez to end the inning and then pitched a perfect sixth to earn the victory. Ryan Brasier pitched a scoreless inning and erstwhile starter Rick Porcello set the Astros down 1-2-3 in the eighth.	Closer Craig Kimbrel gave up Jose Altuve's RBI single with two outs in the ninth before Bregman launched a high fly to left that Andrew Benintendi caught a step in front of the Monster.	"I knew I missed it," Bregman said. "If I got it, it would have been on the street behind Fenway Park."	Gerrit Cole, who was so dominant in his Division Series start against Cleveland, gave up a double to Mookie Betts -- the first batter of the game -- as Boston sent eight batters to the plate in the first and scored twice.	The AL West champs tied it in the second on George Springer's two-run double down the right-field line. And when Gonzalez cleared the Monster -- and the seats above them -- with a two-run homer in the third, it looked like Price was headed for another loss (he has won two postseason games in relief.)	But Boston, which won the AL East and a franchise-record 108 games, came back in the bottom half, starting with Xander Bogaerts' one-out single and then a double by Steve Pearce that sent Gonzalez crashing back-first into the metal scoreboard on the left-field wall. He fell to the warning track, but after the training staff and manger AJ Hinch went out to check on him he stayed in the game.	"The ball, the wall, he's back-pedaling. He's got to make a decision on whether or not to concede the wall and try to play it off the wall or try to make a catch," Hinch said. "It's a well-placed hit."	Cole walked Devers on four pitches to load the bases and struck out Ian Kinsler on three before Bradley lofted one down the left-field line and off the Monster. As the ball bounced back toward the infield, it hopped on the padding along the side wall, just out of Gonzalez's reach.	"Not really catching a break with it rolling on this awkward piece of padding all the way down was unfortunate," Cole said. "But you put yourself in that position."	Betts scored an insurance run in the seventh, walking to lead off the inning and coming around to make it 6-4 on a wild pitch and a pair of passed balls. He gave Boston a 7-4 lead with an RBI double in the eighth.	PRICE IS RIGHT	In all, Price was charged with four runs on five hits and four walks, striking out four in 4 2/3 innings	Price's teams had lost all 10 of his previous postseason starts, the longest such losing streak in baseball history. He allowed three runs and got just five outs in Game 2 against the Yankees, the only Red Sox loss in the series.	As Price left the field on this night, the crowd rose to applaud the pitcher they booed off the mound in the Division Series, and he tapped the brim of his cap.	"It's definitely appreciated," Price said. "It wasn't the line I dreamed up to have tonight. But our offense, our defense, everybody rallied together."	SALE OUT	The Red Sox said Game 1 starter Chris Sale was hospitalized with a stomach illness but Cora said he was still hoping the he would join the team in Houston.	"He was feeling bad and he's at the hospital," Cora said. "From what I know, it's nothing serious. But obviously whenever you have to go to the hospital you've got to be `worried."	Cora said it did not affect his performance in the series opener, which Houston won 7-2 .	HOMER HAPPY	It was Houston's 14th straight postseason game with a homer, breaking the major league record that had been held by the Astros from 2001-04.	UP NEXT	Dallas Keuchel, who was 12-11 with a 3.74 ERA in the regular season, will start Game 3 for Houston. He allowed two runs in five innings in the Game 3 clincher against Cleveland.	With Porcello pitching in relief on Sunday, the Red Sox are expected to start Nathan Eovaldi on Tuesday. He was 6-7 with a 3.81 ERA in the regular season and allowed one run in five innings for the win against the Yankees in Game 3 of the ALDS --  his first career postseason appearance.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

LOS ANGELES --  The Milwaukee Brewers know they can count on their intimidating bullpen to get outs. They may not have been expecting a twice-demoted shortstop to generate so much offense.	Jhoulys Chacin combined with four relievers on a five-hitter and Orlando Arcia hit a two-run homer in a 4-0 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Monday that gave Milwaukee a 2-1 lead in the NL Championship Series.	Los Angeles loaded the bases against Jeremy Jeffress in the ninth inning, but the struggling closer shut the door. He struck out Yasmani Grandal and pinch-hitter Brian Dozier to complete Milwaukee's third shutout in six playoff games this year.	"We feel like we're in really good shape," manager Craig Counsell said.	Game 4 in the best-of-seven series is Tuesday night at Dodger Stadium, with Rich Hill starting for Los Angeles against fellow lefty Gio Gonzalez.	Ryan Braun had an early RBI double off rookie Walker Buehler, who struck out eight in seven innings. Travis Shaw tripled and scored on a wild pitch in the sixth.	Arcia connected for his third postseason homer in the seventh, his second in two games.	"It's a different guy every single day and we've got contributions up and down the roster," Shaw said. "It's been the story of our season."	Chacin scattered three hits over 5 1/3 innings before giving way to Corey Knebel, who worked 1 2/3 perfect innings and struck out his last four batters.	With a runner on second and the Brewers nursing a 2-0 lead, Knebel got Manny Machado to ground out before whiffing Cody Bellinger to end the sixth. The right-hander then fanned Yasiel Puig, Grandal and Enrique Hernandez in the seventh.	Joakim Soria retired Chris Taylor on a foul popup for the first out of the eighth. Josh Hader, who didn't pitch in Game 2 after tossing three scoreless innings in the opener, needed only eight pitches to strike out pinch-hitters David Freese and Matt Kemp to end the eighth.	"It was good that we only used Hader for two outs," Shaw said. "I know we've got three in a row, so he'll be good to go tomorrow and that's a big thing for us."	Hader rarely pitches on consecutive days, but his light workload Monday could give Counsell some options.	"We're playing to win the series, not just games. Obviously with Josh doing not as much tonight, there's lots of possibilities there going forward," he said.	Justin Turner singled and Machado doubled to start the ninth for Los Angeles. Bellinger popped out and slammed his bat before Puig drew a walk, but Counsell stayed with Jeffress, who settled down and came through.	Milwaukee's vaunted bullpen delivered after the Dodgers hit .333 and scored eight of their nine runs against Brewers relievers during the first two games in Milwaukee, both decided by one run.	The Dodgers also came up empty against Chacin with the bases loaded in the second, when Buehler took a called third strike to end the inning.	"We had the right guys in those moments and we just didn't execute," manager Dave Roberts said. "We were 0 for 10 with runners in scoring position."	The Brewers became the first visiting team to pitch a postseason shutout at Dodger Stadium since the Philadelphia Phillies in Game 1 of the 1983 NLCS. Los Angeles had gone 50 consecutive home playoff games without being blanked, the second-longest streak in major league history behind 61 straight for the Boston Red Sox, according to STATS.	The 1905 New York Giants and 1966 Baltimore Orioles were the only other teams to toss three shutouts in their first six games of a postseason, STATS said.	The Brewers entered these playoffs with one shutout in their postseason history.	"Our guys that we're giving the ball to at the start of the game, they're doing a heck of a job, man," Counsell said. "They're setting the tone, really."	Chacin returned to the scene of the Brewers' worst loss of the season, a 21-5 rout on Aug. 2. In that game, he was charged with nine runs -- eight earned -- and five hits, including a grand slam by Bellinger.	Chacin was much better when it counted most. The right-hander struck out six and walked two while outpitching Buehler.	"I've been ready for this for almost 10 years," Chacin said. "Hopefully I get a chance to be in the World Series."	Milwaukee got to Buehler in the first on Braun's double into the left-field corner that scored Christian Yelich, who walked.	The Brewers struck again in the sixth. Bellinger was slow to chase Shaw's triple off the top of the center-field wall and missed making the catch by inches before the ball caromed away.	Shaw scored on Buehler's wild pitch to Jesus Aguilar. The ball bounced off Grandal, who scrambled after it near the third-base line while Shaw ran to the plate, making it 2-0.	In the seventh, Erik Kratz doubled and Arcia followed with a two-run shot to right field.	"Orlando has always been a guy that you want to put a moment on him, put pressure on him," Counsell said. "Put the spotlight on him. He loves it. And I'm not surprised that he's thriving in playoff atmosphere. He has this love and he's wired the right way for this kind of baseball."	Puig chased the ball as it drifted into the lower right-field seats on a night when the first Santa Ana winds of the fall arrived, buffeting the stadium with cool, sustained gusts for most of the game.	It was the latest big hit in October for Arcia, the talented young shortstop who was sent to the minors twice this season as he slumped at the plate. He has three home runs in 20 playoff at-bats, matching his total in 348 at-bats all season.	"Definitely a lot of downs for me and things weren't going my way, so they sent me down," Arcia said through a translator. "I was able to work on stuff, recognize pitches, especially breaking balls. Now I (make) my adjustments and things have been working better."	Buehler gave up five hits and a walk in the longest outing by a Dodgers starter during the series so far.	K-CITY	The 14 strikeouts by Brewers pitchers set a franchise postseason record, topping the old mark of 13 in Game 1 of this year's NLCS and Game 2 of the 2011 NLDS against Arizona.	NEVER TOO LATE	Kratz's double gave him six hits in the postseason, making him the first player to make his playoff debut at age 38 or older and get six or more hits, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.	NO GOOD LATE	After going 13 for 28 in the seventh inning or later during the first two games of the NLCS, when they scored eight of their nine runs, the Dodgers were just 2 of 11 with seven strikeouts Monday.	UP NEXT	Brewers: Gonzalez will go on three days' rest after throwing only two innings in the series opener last Friday.	Dodgers: Hill is 1-2 with a 3.55 ERA in nine career postseason starts. He started Game 4 of the Division Series in Atlanta, allowing two runs and five walks in 4 1/3 innings, but didn't factor in the decision.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

HOUSTON --  Jackie Bradley Jr. didn't let his demeanor change this season, even as fans begged Boston to trade him during a miserable first-half slump.	Stayed steady after the biggest swing of his career, too.	Bradley belted a grand slam for his second big hit in the AL Championship Series, helping the Red Sox beat the Houston Astros 8-2 on Tuesday for a 2-1 series lead. His low-key personality was on display as he rounded the bases without the hint of a smile. He greeted his screaming, excited teammates at home plate with one small jump and a few high fives.	"One of my coaches back in the day ... said: `No one should ever know whether you're winning or losing. Kind of keep the same temperament. That way, it will allow you to put some perspective into things," Bradley said. "And I kind of took that to heart."	Bradley's slam backed a solid start by Nathan Eovaldi, who hushed Houston a day after some social media smack talk from Alex Bregman.	"We can play at any park," Eovaldi said. "The first game is always the biggest one of any series when you go on the road."	Game 4 is Wednesday night, with Boston's Rick Porcello opposing Charlie Morton.	Steve Pearce hit a tiebreaking homer for the Red Sox off Joe Smith in the sixth, a drive that sailed just inside the foul pole in left field for a 3-2 lead.	Bradley's slam capped a five-run burst in the eighth against Roberto Osuna. The Astros closer got two outs but allowed two singles and plunked consecutive batters to force in a run. Bradley then crushed a 1-1 fastball into the right field seats to send Houston fans streaming toward the exits.	"That's the pitch I always get him out with," Osuna said. "He hit it today, but I would go there 100 more times."	Osuna was acquired from Toronto this season while serving a 75-game ban under Major League Baseball's domestic violence policy. He had a 1.99 ERA over 23 games for Houston in the regular season after he returned.	With his childhood hero and fellow Alvin, Texas, native Nolan Ryan sitting behind the plate, Eovaldi turned in another solid start. He allowed six hits and two runs with four strikeouts in six innings for the win in the second playoff start of his career.	"For him, I know it's a special one," Boston manager Alex Cora said.	Bregman had shared a video Monday on Instagram of Houston hitting back-to-back-to-back home runs off Eovaldi in his previous outing against the Astros in June. Eovaldi downplayed the post when asked about it Monday.	Bregman did much of the damage against Eovaldi, getting two hits, an RBI and a walk in three plate appearances. Bregman has reached base safely in 20 of 28 plate appearances this postseason.	"Eovaldi did a great job," Bregman said. "He had really five pitches working for him. He's tough. We knew that coming into the game."	Bradley hit a three-run double during Boston's Game 2 victory, giving him three RBI in consecutive games for the first time in his career. Moments after his slam, fans at TD Garden in Boston began chanting "JBJ!" during the Celtics season opener against the Philadelphia 76ers.	Bradley had caught the ire of many Red Sox fans while batting .210 during the first half of the season.	"It's a credit to him, because at this level, when you're hitting .180 after two months or I think it was three months, it is hard," Cora said. "And he kept showing up. He kept working. He kept working his craft. Now you see the results."	Boston jumped on Dallas Keuchel for two runs in the first, but the Astros cut the lead to 2-1 in the bottom of the inning and tied it on an RBI double by Bregman in the fifth.	The Astros went 1 for 8 with runners in scoring position in the first home game of the series, which was played in front of a sellout crowd of 43,102 and included Astros Hall of Famer Jeff Bagwell and Houston Rockets stars James Harden, Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony. Bregman's double was the only extra-base hit for a team which entered the game having hit at least one homer in a record 14 straight playoff games.	Jose Altuve, at designated hitter on Tuesday because of a bruised knee, walked with two outs in the fifth and scored from first on the double by Bregman, which bounced past third baseman Rafael Devers and into the corner of left field to tie it at 2-2. Altuve also bunted for a single in the seventh.	Eduardo Nunez started at third base for Boston after Cora benched him in favor of Devers in Game 2. Devers took over at third in the bottom of the fourth after pinch-hitting for Nunez in the top of the inning.	WHAT A CATCH	Pearce nearly delivered an extra-base hit with two on in the third, but 5-foot-6 left fielder Tony Kemp jumped at the wall and came up with Pearce's towering fly.	"That's a completely different inning if he hits that ball a foot further or if Tony can't get up on the wall and make that catch," Houston manager AJ Hinch said.	Replays showed the ball may have clanked off the wall just before falling into Kemp's mitt, but umpires upheld the decision when Boston challenged.	"It did hit the wall, but it was actually in my glove at the time," Kemp said.	UP NEXT	Morton will make his 2018 postseason debut. Morton, who spent time on the disabled list late in the season with shoulder discomfort, hasn't pitched since Houston's regular-season finale on Sept. 30. Porcello was scheduled to start Tuesday but was pushed back a game after he pitched in relief in Game 2.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

LOS ANGELES --  By the time Manny Machado rounded third base, the Los Angeles Dodgers had already started streaming out of the dugout.	After more than five hours of tension-filled baseball, they were certainly eager to celebrate.	Cody Bellinger singled home the winning run with two outs in the 13th inning Tuesday night to give Los Angeles a 2-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers that tied the NL Championship Series at two games apiece.	The slumping Bellinger, who began the night 1 for 21 in these playoffs, was chased all the way into left field by teammates. Even manager Dave Roberts ran out to congratulate his outfielder, who got soaked with a Gatorade shower.	"I think we gave each other a big hug," Bellinger said. "I think it was the first time I ever got mobbed out in the outfield."	Bellinger laced a full-count pitch from Junior Guerra into right field to score Machado, who was nearly picked off second base moments earlier. Instead, he slid home and touched the plate with his left hand to beat Christian Yelich's throw and finally end an October nail-biter that took 5 hours, 15 minutes.	"One of the crazier games, where there's really no margin on either side," Roberts said. "The bullpen, what they did tonight against a very good offensive club, my hat's off to these guys."	It was the fourth extra-inning postseason game in Dodger Stadium history, and the home team's first such win since beating Philadelphia in Game 4 of the 1978 NLCS.	"It was a great baseball game, it really was," Yelich said. "Both sides had opportunities and they were just able to cash one in there at the end."	After a quick turnaround, Game 5 in the best-of-seven series is Wednesday afternoon, with Wade Miley pitching for the Brewers on three days' rest against fellow lefty Clayton Kershaw.	The teams return to Milwaukee for Game 6 on Friday.	"We lock it in, win one tomorrow, and we feel a lot better heading home," Yelich said.	With one out in the 13th, Machado hit a broken-bat single to left field and went to second on Guerra's wild pitch. With first base open and a struggling Yasmani Grandal on deck followed by the pitcher's spot, the Brewers chose to pitch to Bellinger -- and it cost them.	"Honestly, I didn't think he was going to throw me a strike," Bellinger said. "And then once I noticed he was attacking me, I just tried to put the ball in play and hopefully find a hole this time."	Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said: "I thought it was worth the risk of trying to expand to Bellinger, and if the at-bat goes to Grandal, we walk Grandal."	Bellinger, who entered as a pinch hitter in the sixth, also made a diving catch on his belly of a ball hit by Lorenzo Cain leading off the 10th, spreading his arms out and sliding like a snow angel in right field.	"I played right field in the minor leagues a lot before I started playing center field. I haven't been there much lately," Bellinger said. "But it's kind of like riding a bike. I saw it hanging up there, and ran as fast as I could and dove for it."	Both teams used all their position players and wasted numerous chances. Los Angeles went through its entire bullpen.	The Dodgers struck out 17 times -- all against Milwaukee relievers -- and have whiffed 49 times in the series. The Brewers fanned 15 times.	"Exhausting," Los Angeles outfielder Chris Taylor said. "Just a mental and physical grind all the way to the end."	Dodgers starter Rich Hill allowed one run and three hits in five innings.	The Brewers tied it 1-all in the fifth on pinch-hitter Domingo Santana's RBI double that took one hop against the right-field wall with Yasiel Puig scrambling in pursuit.	The Dodgers led 1-0 on Brian Dozier's RBI single in the first off Gio Gonzalez, who left after twisting his ankle while trying to field an infield single by Puig in the second.	Gonzalez has a high ankle sprain and might need to be replaced on the roster, Counsell said.	The sellout crowd of 53,764 was considerably noisier than on Monday, when Enrique Hernandez criticized Dodgers fans for being too quiet. Joc Pederson and Bellinger waved blue rally towels in the dugout.	But the Dodgers again struggled at the plate after going 0 for 10 with runners in scoring position during a 4-0 loss in Game 3.	Milwaukee put the potential go-ahead run on third in the seventh before Cain grounded out against Dylan Floro.	The Dodgers had runners at the corners in the eighth against hard-throwing Josh Hader, who pitched for the second consecutive day. Pinch-hitter Matt Kemp struck out to end the threat.	The Brewers had another chance in the ninth against closer Kenley Jansen. With fans on their feet, pinch-hitter Travis Shaw struck out with a runner on third to end the inning.	In the 10th, Ryan Braun singled with two outs and stole second against Jansen, who struck out Jesus Aguilar.	And when Bellinger finally ended it, the only NLCS game that had lasted longer was the New York Mets' 15-inning victory over Atlanta in Game 5 in 1999, which took 5 hours, 46 minutes.	"Let's get something to eat," Dozier said afterward. "I'm starving."	MANNY'S MOVE	Machado allowed his left leg to clip the lower right leg of Aguilar at first base while getting thrown out on a routine play in the 10th. Aguilar appeared upset and the two exchanged words . Both benches and bullpens emptied, but no punches were thrown.	"It's a dirty play by a dirty player," Yelich said.	Aguilar, however, said the two talked it out after Machado singled in the 13th. Machado said they go back to their days in the minors.	"Everything that happens on the field stays on the field," Machado said. "He's a great guy."	TICKETS ANYBODY?	The Dodgers said tickets were still available for Game 5, which begins at 2:05 p.m. PDT.

He threw 74 pitches over 5 2/3 scoreless innings Saturday in Game 2 of the NLCS, allowing two hits while striking out three and walking none. His other start came in Game 3 of the NLDS at Colorado. He didn't factor in the decision either time.	Dodgers: Kershaw took the loss in Game 1 against the Brewers.

LOS ANGELES --  Clayton Kershaw put his previous flop behind him and pushed the Los Angeles Dodgers forward -- one victory from a return trip to the World Series.	With so much at stake, the three-time Cy Young Award winner bounced back from one of his worst postseason starts with one of his best, pitching the Dodgers past the Milwaukee Brewers 5-2 Wednesday for a 3-2 lead in the NL Championship Series.	"I don't really think about the one before. And after this one I'm not going to think about this one, either," Kershaw said.	Max Muncy hit a go-ahead single in the sixth inning for the defending NL champs. Kershaw held the lead, scoring an insurance run in the seventh and then exiting.	Roughed up in the NLCS opener, Kershaw mixed his fastball and slider on a hot day to shut down the Brewers. The Dodgers ace didn't allow a baserunner past the third inning.	"He just has a knack," Brewers star Christian Yelich said. "He has the ability to punch guys out."	Game 6 is Friday night in Milwaukee. The Brewers will start left-hander Wade Miley, who walked Cody Bellinger to open Game 5 before getting pulled in an interesting piece of strategy by manager Craig Counsell. Hyun-Jin Ryu will go for the Dodgers.	"To go back to Milwaukee up 3-2 as opposed to being down 3-2 is huge for us," Kershaw said. "It's been a battle every single game we've played them so far and we don't expect anything different when we go back."	The Brewers do.	"We're in a good spot, man," Counsell said. "We're going back home, to me, in a position of strength."	The Dodgers haven't been in back-to-back World Series since losing to the Yankees in 1977 and `78. They were beaten by Houston in Game 7 last year.	"You've seen it this entire postseason, even when we're behind, we're battling back, putting ourselves in a position to possibly tie games or take the lead late," Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner said. "That's where our experience comes in. We never count ourselves out."	If the Brewers rally to win the series and this ends up being Kershaw's last start for the Dodgers, he left behind a gem. The left-hander can opt out of the last two years and $70 million remaining on his contract after the World Series and become a free agent. He said Tuesday he hasn't made a decision about his future.	The teams reconvened less than 15 hours after the Dodgers eked out a 2-1 victory Tuesday night on Cody Bellinger's RBI single with two outs in a 13-inning game that lasted over five hours.	Pitching in 82-degree sunshine, Kershaw was well-rested and masterful in allowing one run and three hits over seven. He struck out nine, all on breaking pitches, and walked two.	Kershaw recovered from the shortest postseason start of his career. He lasted just three innings in losing the NLCS opener while giving up five runs -- four earned -- at Miller Park.	"I don't know if it was that much, just a little bit better execution maybe," Kershaw said of his repertoire. "Maybe I threw some more curveballs today than I did in Game 1."	Kershaw pitched in and out of trouble in the third, when the Brewers loaded the bases and scored their lone run. Kershaw struck out Jesus Aguilar to end the third, the first of 13 consecutive batters that the left-hander retired.	"Anytime you can work yourself out of situations like that that's going to make or break the game," Kershaw said. "Minimizing damage as best you can as a starting pitcher is huge."	Curtis Granderson hit an RBI double in the ninth. Kenley Jansen, the Dodgers' third pitcher of the ninth, came in for the last two outs and the save.	Yelich, who nearly won the NL Triple Crown this season, was hitless in four at-bats. He is 3 for 20 without an RBI in the NLCS.	"Just not capitalizing," he said. "It's frustrating."	The Dodgers' offense broke loose with five runs over the fifth, sixth and seventh innings that had the sellout crowd of 54,502 on its feet whipping blue towels and cheering loudly.	The team that hit a franchise and NL-leading 235 home runs in the regular season did it playing small ball instead, driving in all but one of its runs on singles.	"The little things played a big part," Roberts said.	The Dodgers tied the game 1-all on Austin Barnes' RBI single up the middle in the fifth. Chris Taylor singled leading off, took second on shortstop Orlando Arcia's throwing error and stole third.	"It was huge to get there to third base, less than two outs, give us a shot to do some things," Barnes said of Taylor.	Muncy grounded a 1-2 pitch from Brandon Woodruff into left field, scoring Turner, who led off with a single. Yasiel Puig singled to center with two outs, bringing home Manny Machado after he was hit by a pitch from Corbin Burnes.	Los Angeles extended the lead to 5-1 in the seventh on Turner's RBI single that scored Kershaw, who walked, and pinch-hitter Brian Dozier's RBI groundout.	Kershaw has struggled in the postseason during his career, with his numbers never matching his excellence during the regular season.	But his outing Wednesday nearly matched what he did in Game 2 of the NL Division Series against Atlanta. Kershaw allowed two hits over eight shutout innings, struck out three and walked none in the best postseason outing of his career.	"It's just a classic case of he executed a lot of pitches," Counsell said.	The Brewers led 1-0 in the third on Lorenzo Cain's RBI double to deep center.	WORKING WITH A LEAD	The Dodgers are 5-1 in series when they own a 3-2 lead. Their only loss came in the 1952 World Series against the Yankees. Teams with a 3-2 lead in a best-of-seven NLCS have a 15-6 series record.	GET TO THE `PEN	Milwaukee's starters have tossed just 14 innings in the NLCS, the lowest total ever through five games, according to Elias Sports Bureau. The 2008 Dodgers and 1984 Padres share the record for fewest innings by starting pitchers with 21 1/3.	TOOTH HUNTING	Granderson chipped his right front tooth in the ninth and wore a bandage on his lower lip where his helmet hit him. He never did find his tooth despite help from Turner, Machado and Dozier.	"We couldn't find it out there. Too small," Granderson said. "Hopefully, I'll be able to eat tonight, which is the biggest concern."	UP NEXT	Miley will become the first pitcher to start consecutive games for his team in the same postseason since George Earnshaw of the Philadelphia Athletics in the 1930 World Series against the Cardinals, STATS said. He pitched 5 2/3 shutout innings in Game 2 vs. the Dodgers, allowing two hits and walking none. Ryu gave up two runs and six hits in 4 1/3 innings in that game. Ryu pitched seven shutout innings in Game 1 of the NLDS against Atlanta, allowing four hits and striking out eight.	---	More AP MLB: www.apnews.com/tag/MLB and www.twitter.com/AP-Sports	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

HOUSTON --  Andrew Benintendi charged in hard and left his feet.	Make the catch, Boston wins.	If not ... no telling.	On this night, though, even a ball the Red Sox didn't grab went their way.	Benintendi made a diving play in left field with the bases loaded for the final out, and Boston held off the Houston Astros 8-6 Wednesday to take a 3-1 lead in the AL Championship Series.	"I thought I could catch it and timed it up well," Benintendi said. "At that point, it was either do or die."	Boosted by a questionable fan interference call and another home run from Jackie Bradley Jr. in a gripping, back-and-forth game, the Red Sox moved within one victory of their first World Series trip since winning the 2013 title.	Craig Kimbrel earned a shaky six-out save, helped by a rocket throw from right fielder Mookie Betts and Benintendi's daring grab of Alex Bregman's sinking liner. Had the ball scooted past Benintendi, it easily could have scored three runs and won the game for Houston.	"Beni took a shot. Had a great jump. And he got it," Boston manager Alex Cora said.	With that, the Red Sox improved to 4-0 on the road in these playoffs and inched closer to eliminating the defending World Series champions.	"This game was incredibly good on both sides -- great at-bats, great plays," Astros manager AJ Hinch said. "The difference in that game literally was a couple inches."	Game 5 is Thursday night in Houston, where ace Justin Verlander will pitch for the Astros with their season on the line. David Price, who was warming up in the bullpen late in Game 4, will start for Boston on three days' rest after Chris Sale was ruled out Wednesday while recovering from a stomach illness.	Bradley hit a go-ahead homer in the sixth inning, his latest huge swing for a Red Sox team that got knocked out of last year's playoffs by Houston in the Division Series.	Boston has won three straight after a Game 1 loss, and this one came with some controversy.	Astros star Jose Altuve was denied a potential two-run homer in the first inning and called out after fans reaching for the ball interfered with Betts' attempt at a leaping catch.	"Jose pays the biggest price, because the trajectory of the ball looked like it was going to leave the ballpark," Hinch said. "Changed that whole inning."	Boston trailed by one with two outs in the sixth when Christian Vazquez doubled to deep right-center. Center fielder George Springer nearly made a jumping grab, but the ball glanced off his glove.	Bradley, who hit a grand slam in Game 3 and a three-run double in Game 2, put the Red Sox on top 6-5 with his soaring shot to right field on the next pitch from rookie Josh James.	"I'm very proud of him, what he's done in the second part of the season and what he's done tonight and in this series. It's amazing," Cora said about Bradley.	Boston got some insurance in the seventh when Lance McCullers walked in a run after taking over for Ryan Pressly with the bases loaded and two outs. J.D. Martinez added an RBI single in the eighth.	Houston cut the margin to two on an RBI groundout by Altuve in the eighth. Right fielder Josh Reddick made a diving catch of Betts' liner with the bases loaded to end the top of the ninth.	Red Sox starter Rick Porcello allowed seven hits and four runs over four innings in a wild game that took 4 hours, 33 minutes. Joe Kelly was the winner after giving up a run in the fifth.	Rafael Devers and Xander Bogaerts had two RBI apiece for the Red Sox, who have outscored their opponents 36-12 on the road this postseason.	Houston's Carlos Correa, who has struggled with back problems for months, had three hits and two RBI for his first multihit game this postseason. Springer and Tony Kemp each hit a solo homer for the Astros, who left 13 runners on base.	A rusty Charlie Morton gave up three hits, three runs and two walks in just 2 1/3 innings. He also threw two wild pitches in his first outing for the Astros since the regular-season finale on Sept. 30.	James took over and yielded three runs while striking out five in 3 2/3 innings during his second postseason appearance.	Devers' two-run single gave the Red Sox two runs in the first inning for the third straight game.	The disputed call came in the bottom of the inning when umpires ruled a fan interfered with Betts as he tried to snag Altuve's drive above the right-field wall.	"I'm 100 percent positive I was going to be able to catch that one," Betts said. "I jumped and went over, reached my hand up, I felt like somebody was kind of pushing my glove out of the way or something."	Crew chief Joe West, working the right-field line, signaled fan interference after the ball ricocheted back onto the field.	"The spectator reached out of the stands and hit him over the playing field and closed his glove," West said. "That's why I called spectator interference."	The call stood after a replay review that lasted 3 minutes, 13 seconds.	"The replay official said I was right," West explained. "That's all. He said I have nothing that can change it."	Altuve was ruled out and Springer was sent back to first base.	Cora, for one, wasn't surprised.	"Joe calls it right away and I saw the replay," he said. "And I said, no way they're going to overturn this. I was pretty sure."	Altuve was disappointed with the call but not mad at the fan.	"I don't have anything against him," he said. "He's another Astros fan rooting for us. Appreciate he was trying to help me."	Kemp gave Houston its first lead at 4-3 in the fourth when he knocked a slider from Porcello over the wall in the right-field corner.	Benintendi's second double came in the fifth and he scored on a two-out single by Bogaerts to tie it at 4.	Correa's run-scoring single made it 5-4 in the bottom of the inning.	SMALL FRATERNITY	Bradley joined Nomar Garciaparra (1998) as the only Red Sox players to have at least three RBI in three straight postseason games.	FLIPPING OUT	Red Sox first baseman Steve Pearce flipped head over heels into the Astros dugout chasing a foul ball hit by Reddick in the seventh. Pearce's legs crashed into a bench but he didn't hit his head. Several Astros then aided Pearce, with Verlander grabbing him by the hand and helping him up after the spill.	UP NEXT	Verlander is 6-1 with a 2.44 ERA in eight postseason appearances for the Astros. He allowed two hits and two runs over six innings for the win in Houston's 7-2 victory in Game 1 at Fenway Park.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

HOUSTON --  What a birthday present for rookie manager Alex Cora. He's taking the Boston Red Sox back to the World Series.	David Price put his postseason woes behind him, pitching the Red Sox past the defending champion Houston Astros 4-1 Thursday night in Game 5 of the AL Championship Series.	Next stop for the 108-win Red Sox is Fenway Park for the World Series opener Tuesday night against either the Los Angeles Dodgers or Milwaukee Brewers.	But before leaving Minute Maid Park, the Red Sox surrounded the 43-year-old Cora in the clubhouse and heartily sang "happy birthday!" Wearing goggles and championship gear, the team saluted the first manager from Puerto Rico to lead a team to the World Series.	Cora was hired a year ago as he prepared to go to the Series as Houston's bench coach. He got the job a month after Hurricane Maria devastated his island homeland, and immediately went to work helping with relief efforts.	"I know right know for everything that we're going through as a nation, as a country, for me to stand up here with this trophy, I know there's a lot of people proud of me in Puerto Rico," he said.	Rafael Devers hit a three-run homer as the Red Sox stunned Justin Verlander to win the best-of-seven set 4-1.	ALCS MVP Jackie Bradley Jr. , outfielder Mookie Betts and the Red Sox will try to bring Boston its fourth crown in 15 years -- this is their first trip since winning it all in 2013.	Los Angeles has a 3-2 lead in the NLCS going into Game 6 on Friday night at Miller Park.	"We got four more wins. That was very, very special, absolutely. But we want more," Price said.	Pitching on only three days' rest after Boston ace Chris Sale was ruled out while recovering from a stomach illness, Price struck out nine in six shutout innings of three-hit ball . The left-hander, who has had a rough time in Boston since signing a $217 million contract before the 2016 season, entered 0-9 with a 6.16 ERA in 11 career postseason starts.	Price was thrilled that he won't be questioned anymore about not having a postseason win as a starter.	"That's awesome," he said. "I don't have to prepare myself for it in spring training on Feb. 20 or September when I've still got five regular-season starts. I don't have to answer that question anymore. And man, it feels good."	Price was warming in the bullpen as Game 4 ended, perhaps jeopardizing his readiness for Thursday. Instead, that session may have keyed his dominant performance.	"It felt good. Honestly, it really started last night in the bullpen. Threw quite a few pitches to come in for the next hitter, found something out while doing that and kind of just carried that over to today," Price said.	Price tipped his cap to a few hundred Red Sox fans assembled behind the Boston dugout while they cheered as he walked off the field following postgame interviews.	The only time thing that didn't go smoothly for Price came when he brought 1-year-old son Xavier into the postgame news conference and the little one wouldn't quit shrieking and wriggling away from him .	Price pulled him back onto his lap, repeating the words: "This is big, dude. This is big."	After dropping the opener at home, Boston took four straight -- including three in a row in Houston to improve to 5-0 on the road in these playoffs.	The Red Sox are the first team to win four straight postseason games against a 100-win club since the 2004 Red Sox against both the Yankees and Cardinals, STATS said.	"Since Day One, we knew we had something special. We just needed to stay healthy and go out and execute," Bradley said.	Left fielder Andrew Benintendi caught a long fly for the last out -- not nearly as dramatic as his game-saving diving grab the previous night. Just the same, it capped off a win.	"The last out yesterday was like around 12:10. So we won two on my birthday. I'll take it. I'll take it," Cora said.	There was a smattering of boos from the home crowd as the Red Sox charged onto the field, embracing as they jumped around near the middle of the diamond. They posed for a team picture on the mound a couple of minutes later as members of Houston's pitching staff slowly walked by, glancing at the revelry on their way back from the bullpen.	"They beat us. We ran out of wins," Astros manager AJ Hinch said .	Despite leading the majors in wins during the regular season, the Red Sox were underdogs against a Houston team that defeated the Dodgers in last year's World Series and romped past Cleveland in the Division Series this month.	But stars Jose Altuve, Carlos Correa and the Astros hobbled to the finish in a humbling defeat. Still, no team has repeated as World Series champs since the New York Yankees won three straight from 1998-2000.	Altuve, last year's AL MVP, didn't want to make excuses but said this was "absolutely" the worst pain he's ever played with.	"I feel really, really bad for not being on the field for my team, but one thing you can know is that I gave everything I had, healthy, not healthy that was all I have," he said still wearing his uniform long after the game had ended.	Red Sox slugger J.D. Martinez hit an early homer off Verlander , and Price made the lead stand up into the late innings. Craig Kimbrel worked the ninth for his third save of the series.	Red Sox president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski is taking his third organization to the World Series. He won two championships as general manager of the Florida Marlins, then oversaw two pennants as GM of the Detroit Tigers. Dombrowski was hired by Boston in 2015.	It was the 14th pennant for the Red Sox, who are 8-4 in World Series appearances. They took the American League flag in 1904, but the World Series wasn't played that year.	Boston ended an 86-year championship drought in 2004.	Verlander had pitched 24 scoreless innings over his previous three starts with his team facing postseason elimination, and he came in 4-1 with a 1.21 ERA in five potential elimination games during his career.	Houston's only run came on a homer by Marwin Gonzalez in the seventh off Matt Barnes .	Devers connected in the sixth for a 4-0 lead.	Devers, who turns 22 on Wednesday, has 12 RBI in 10 postseason games. He joined Mickey Mantle, Andruw Jones and Miguel Cabrera as the only players in major league history to have nine or more RBI in the postseason at age 21 or younger.	UP NEXT	Sale, who spent Sunday night in a hospital because of a stomach illness, has recovered and is set to start Game 1 of the World Series. Cora said Sale threw off flat ground on Thursday and was feeling better after he was unable to start on Wednesday because of the issue.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLBbaseball and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

Mike Moustakas credits Wade Miley for his performance, especially after giving up a leadoff homer, and evaluates Milwaukee's bullpen. (0:58)	MILWAUKEE --  Ryan Braun slid across home plate and raised his arms in sheer joy.	A big lead, a bruising bullpen and a boisterous crowd have the Milwaukee Brewers all set up for Game 7.	Jesus Aguilar sparked Milwaukee's slumping lineup with three RBI on a pair of two-out hits, and the Brewers beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 7-2 on Friday night to even the NL Championship Series at three games each.	"I don't think about me. The most important thing, at the end of the day, is win games," said Aguilar, who had driven in just two runs in the playoffs. "Tomorrow it can be somebody else. Tonight, it was me."	Game 7 is Saturday night in front of the same frenzied crowd that booed Manny Machado vociferously after he tangled with Aguilar while the series was in Los Angeles. Dodgers rookie Walker Buehler faces journeyman Jhoulys Chacin, with well-rested relief ace Josh Hader looming in the bullpen for Milwaukee after a surprise day off.	It's the first Game 7 for the Brewers since losing to St. Louis in 1982 in their only World Series appearance. The Dodgers dropped Game 7 of the World Series last year to Houston.	"Got to get them tomorrow. We got one more game," Machado said. "They played good baseball today. So, we just got to play a better one tomorrow."	David Freese led off this Game 6 with a home run that quieted Miller Park -- but just for a moment.	Backed by raucous fans waving yellow towels that read "ONE TOUGH CREW," Milwaukee rebounded from consecutive losses at Dodger Stadium with the same formula it used to win the NL Central during a breakout season.	Some timely hitting by Aguilar and company produced an early lead, and Corey Knebel and Jeremy Jeffress led the way in another shutdown performance by Milwaukee's tough bullpen.	"Anybody, anywhere, anytime," Knebel said. "We're ready to go."	Los Angeles was looking for its second straight NL pennant and some time to prepare for the mighty Boston Red Sox in the World Series. But losing pitcher Hyun-Jin Ryu was tagged for four runs in the first inning, two on a double by Aguilar that sent Braun sliding home.	After Wade Miley pitched into the fifth inning in his second straight start -- he faced only one batter in Game 5 -- Knebel, Jeffress and Corbin Burnes closed it out with hitless relief. Knebel got the win and Burnes retired the Dodgers in order in the ninth, setting off a wild celebration for the crowd of 43,619.	Manager Craig Counsell considered bringing in Hader, especially in the eighth, but Aguilar scored on a wild pitch in the seventh and singled in Lorenzo Cain in the eighth. The extra room helped persuade Counsell to give Hader another day of rest. The rocket-armed reliever hasn't pitched since Tuesday in Game 4.	"Best-case scenario for sure for us," Counsell said.	Freese drove in both runs for the Dodgers. The rest of the Los Angeles lineup managed just three measly singles. Hounded by boos all night long, Machado went 0 for 4 with two strikeouts.	"You know what? I'm focused on the game," Machado said. "Try to go pitch by pitch, drive in runs. Do what we got to do on the field. We didn't execute today."	The 35-year-old Freese was a surprise choice for leadoff hitter by Dave Roberts, and he made his manager look quite good when he started the game with a drive to right-center for his ninth career postseason homer.	Freese also connected in the first inning of the previous NLCS Game 6 in Milwaukee, helping the Cardinals win the pennant in 2011. It was just his fourth time in the leadoff spot in his 10 years in the majors.	But the Brewers put together a quick response that set the tone for the rest of the night. With runners on first and second in the bottom half of the first, Aguilar lined an opposite-field double into the corner in right.	Mike Moustakas followed with another RBI double and scored on Erik Kratz's single to make it 4-1. The Brewers managed just three runs in the previous two games in Los Angeles.	"It was huge to be able to answer back in the first inning after the homer," Moustakas said. "One would have been great, two would have been awesome. To put up four right there just gives us a lot of confidence."	Christian Yelich and Braun combined for another run with consecutive doubles in the second, and then it became a question of strategy for Roberts and Counsell with Game 7 on deck.	Roberts used starting pitcher Rich Hill in the eighth after Kenta Maeda struggled, staying away from key reliever Pedro Baez and closer Kenley Jansen. Counsell stayed with Knebel for five outs, giving him his first pro plate appearance with the bases loaded in the fifth -- he struck out -- and Burnes worked two perfect innings.	"There's the thought of trying to go to your `pen in the first inning or the second inning, but there's a significant cost potentially for a potential Game 7," Roberts said. "So I just felt that we needed to get some more innings out of Hyun-Jin to keep our highest leverage guys available for a potential Game 7."	---	Jay Cohen can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/jcohenap	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

Cody Bellinger reflects on his second straight trip to the World Series in only his second year in the majors. (0:41)	MILWAUKEE --  Yasiel Puig and Cody Bellinger flexed their muscles. Chris Taylor flashed some leather.	Then the Los Angeles Dodgers got a lift from ace Clayton Kershaw out of the bullpen to finish off the Milwaukee Brewers and return to the World Series.	Puig broke open a tight contest with a three-run homer in the sixth inning, Taylor robbed Christian Yelich with a super catch and the Dodgers took Game 7 of the NL Championship Series with a 5-1 win on Saturday night.	It's off to Fenway Park for a showdown against the Boston Red Sox in Game 1 of the World Series on Tuesday.	"It's pretty cool. It's going to be a pretty special series," said Bellinger, chosen as the NLCS MVP.	Los Angeles hasn't won the World Series since 1988. The Dodgers and Red Sox have met once before in the World Series, back in 1916 with Boston beating Brooklyn behind a big game from pitcher Babe Ruth.	Kenley Jansen tossed 1 1/3 scoreless innings before yielding to Kershaw in the ninth. The three-time Cy Young Award winner, pitching on two days of rest after starting Game 5, finished off the Brewers by striking out Mike Moustakas in a perfect ninth.	Kershaw's teammates mobbed the lefty near the mound after the final out, and the celebration was just beginning for the Dodgers.	"I'm just so proud of our guys for enduring this roller coaster of a season," manager Dave Roberts said.	What a surge for a team that was 10 games under .500 on May 16.	The Dodgers have talked about having unfinished business after losing Game 7 of the World Series last year to the Houston Astros.	Now they've made baseball's final series of the year in back-to-back seasons for the first time since 1977-78.	"I know how lucky I am to be a part of it two years in a row," Bellinger said.	With their 23rd pennant, the Dodgers have matched the rival Giants for most among NL teams.	The Brewers had their chances against rookie starter Walker Buehler, a 24-year-old right-hander who navigated through trouble over 4 2/3 innings. He allowed six hits, including a home run in the first by Yelich that made it 1-0.	Yelich looked like he would hurt the Dodgers again in the fifth with Lorenzo Cain on second with two outs. The NL MVP candidate hit a high, hard liner to left that seemed destined to fall in for a double.	Running at full speed to his left, Taylor extended his glove high in the air just as the ball settled into the mitt to end the inning.	"They made the plays, they made the pitches when they had to (make) to win," Yelich said.	AFTER HADER	The Dodgers waited for lights-out lefty Josh Hader to leave the game to get their bats going again.	Brewers manager Craig Counsell brought in Hader in the third after starter Jhoulys Chacin allowed a two-run homer to Bellinger in the second for a 2-1 lead for the Dodgers. Hader tossed three shutout innings, striking out four before being pulled after 31 pitches.	Milwaukee's vaunted bullpen then scuffled in the sixth.	Puig's three-run shot off reliever Jeremy Jeffress quieted the breathless, screaming Brewers fans at Miller Park. Puig had been hitless in his previous five at-bats against Jeffress, striking out each time.	POWER PACKED	The excitable Puig raised both arms as he rounded second, wiggling his fingers skyward to mimic the Brewers' trademark celebration move. Manny Machado, the object of nonstop boos from Milwaukee fans, obliged with the same gesture as he watched from the dugout steps.	Bellinger raised his right arm and pointed to his biceps as he rounded third after his homer.	The mighty Dodgers, who hit an NL-best 235 homers, outslugged the Brewers, who were second in the league with 218.	WHAT A CATCH	Taylor said that it was so loud in the outfield that trying to communicate with Bellinger in center while tracking Yelich's liner in the gap in the fifth was difficult.	It was about reacting at that point, Taylor said.	"A lefty hits it in the gap, it kind of tails. You really don't know how much that ball is going to tail. So really, it's just a reaction play," he said.	LOOKING FORWARD	The loss ended a remarkable year for the Brewers. A late surge led by Yelich lifted Milwaukee from 5 1/2 games out of the NL Central lead on Aug. 28 to one win short of the franchise's second World Series appearance.	"They took us on an amazing journey," Counsell said about his team. "It was a magical run."	An American League team in 1982, the Brewers lost the Series in seven games that year to the St. Louis Cardinals.	Game 7 against the Dodgers was the first at home for the franchise, coming 36 years to the day after losing the seventh game to the Cardinals in the Series.	Same result on Saturday.	With Yelich and first baseman Jesus Aguilar emerging as offensive cornerstones, along with a deep well of young pitching in the majors, the Brewers figure to contend again in 2019.	They'll have to dethrone the Dodgers.	"We were right there," Jeffress said. "I think the biggest thing we take from this is we have all the pieces next year, we just have to put it together better than we did today."	----	More AP MLB: www.apnews.com/tag/MLB and www.twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.

BOSTON --  The Fenway Funhouse proved too tricky, too cold and just too much for the beach boys.	Andrew Benintendi, J.D. Martinez and the Boston Red Sox came out swinging in the World Series opener, seizing every advantage in their quirky ballpark to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 8-4 on a chilly, windy Tuesday night.	Benintendi had four hits, Martinez drove in two early runs and pinch-hitter Eduardo Nunez golfed a three-run homer to seal it. The 108-win Red Sox got a solid effort from their bullpen after an expected duel between aces Chris Sale and Clayton Kershaw never developed.	From the get-go, old Fenway Park caused all sorts of problems for the Dodgers.	Mookie Betts led off for the Red Sox with a popup that twisted first baseman David Freese as he tried to navigate the tight foul space near the stands and gauge the gusts. Lost, he overran the ball and it dropped behind him.	"You never really know," Benintendi said. "The flag will be blowing one way, and the wind is actually blowing the other. You have to be on your toes pretty much."	Given a second chance, Betts lined a single that set up a two-run first inning.	"It was important for us to score first and kind of put some pressure on them," he said.	In the seventh, newly inserted left fielder Joc Pederson looked hesitant as he chased Benintendi's soft fly, rushing toward the seats that jut out down the line. The ball ticked off his glove for a ground-rule double, and soon Nunez connected off Alex Wood to break open a 5-4 game.	"We didn't play the defense that we typically do. I thought we left some outs out there," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. "And it didn't make Clayton's job any easier."	The crowd and cold temperatures were no picnic for Los Angeles, either.	The oddly angled ballpark became an echo chamber even before the first pitch. Chants of "Beat LA!" began early, Kershaw got heckled with a sing-song serenade and Dodgers villain Manny Machado heard loud boos all evening.	Only one person wearing Dodger blue drew a cheer: Roberts, saluted in pregame introductions for the daring steal that turned the tide in Boston's 2004 playoff comeback against the Yankees.	"I think we had the advantage tonight with the weather and stuff. We've been playing through it," Red Sox pitcher Nathan Eovaldi said.	It was 53 degrees at first pitch and it dropped into the mid-40s by the end. That was the coldest game for Los Angeles this season and quite a contrast from last year's World Series, when it was a record 103 degrees for the opener at Dodger Stadium against Houston.	"We won Game 1 last year and lost the Series, so maybe we'll try it out this way. See if we can win one," Kershaw said.	Game 2 is Wednesday night, when it's supposed to be even colder. David Price, fresh from beating Houston in the ALCS clincher, starts against Hyun-Jin Ryu.	Both teams rely heavily on analytics, and it showed: With each manager searching for the most beneficial matchup, the clubs combined to use 12 pitchers and six pinch-hitters.	Benintendi scored three times for Boston, trying for its fourth championship in 15 seasons.	Matt Kemp homered and Justin Turner had three hits for the Dodgers, aiming for their first crown since 1988. Machado drove in three runs, and his RBI grounder in the fifth inning made it 3-all.	Boston retook the lead in the bottom half when Xander Bogaerts hustled to beat out a potential inning-ending double play -- Dodgers reliever Ryan Madson seemed to celebrate a little too early.	Rafael Devers followed with an RBI single, making it 5-3 and giving himself an early birthday present. He turned 22 at midnight, three minutes before the game ended.	Martinez, who led the majors with 130 RBI, gave the crowd a scare when his foot slipped rounding second base on a run-scoring double in the third. He fell hard, but soon got up.	Steve Pearce, ruled safe at first on a replay review, scored from there on Martinez's double. The ball hit a metal garage-type grate on the far center-field wall and took a weird carom, giving Pearce extra time to score.	A garage-style grate, used for groundskeeping vehicles and such. What other park has that in play?	A day before this opener, Kershaw and most of the Dodgers pooh-poohed the prospect that Fenway would cause them trouble. Most of them had never played at the oldest ballpark in the majors, built in 1912, but said they were sure they'd be OK.	It didn't quite turn out that way in their first trip to Fenway since 2010.	Besides, clubs coming to Beantown have other things to worry about.	"I think the biggest challenge for a team coming in here is you're playing the Boston Red Sox," Eovaldi said Monday.	The only other time the Dodgers and Red Sox met in the World Series was 1916, when Babe Ruth helped pitch Boston to the championship. Those games were at Braves Field, the bigger home park of the city's National League franchise.	Kershaw and Sale each started out wearing short sleeves, but neither warmed to the possibility of the marquee matchup. In similar outings, both were pulled before getting an out in the fifth.	Kershaw took the loss in his first appearance at Fenway, tagged for five runs on seven hits and three walks. The three-time NL Cy Young Award winner fell to 9-9 in the postseason, his October results falling short of his brilliant regular-season resume.	"All the way around it wasn't a good night," Kershaw said.	Sale threw 91 pitches in his first outing since the ALCS opener. He was hospitalized last week for an unspecified stomach illness.	Matt Barnes, the first of six Boston relievers, got the win. Eovaldi pitched the eighth and Craig Kimbrel worked the ninth as the Red Sox bullpen held the Dodgers to one run on three hits in five innings.	Boston manager Alex Cora won in his first try guiding a club in the Series. This also marked the first World Series game between teams led by minority managers.	YAY FOR YAZ	Red Sox great Carl Yastrzemski bounced the ceremonial first pitch, and decided that just wouldn't do. So he called for another ball, and the 79-year-old Hall of Famer threw a strike to injured Boston star Dustin Pedroia.	FIRST UP	The Red Sox have won Game 1 in six straight World Series, dating to 1975 vs. the Big Red Machine. ... Boston is 8-0 this postseason when scoring first. ... The team that wins the opener has won 62 percent of the championships.	UP NEXT	Price had been 0-9 in 11 postseason starts before pitching six scoreless innings to help close out the Astros in Game 5. Ryu was 1-1 with a 3.40 ERA in three playoff starts this year.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

BOSTON --  From playoff flop to October ace in two legacy-shifting starts, David Price earned his second postseason victory in a row and moved the Boston Red Sox halfway to yet another World Series title.	The Red Sox left-hander pitched six innings of three-hit ball, and major league RBI leader J.D. Martinez broke a fifth-inning tie during another two-out rally to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 4-2 on Wednesday night.	Game 3 is Friday in Los Angeles. The Dodgers need a win to avoid an 0-3 deficit that no World Series team has ever recovered from.	"This is the biggest stage in baseball," Price said after his longest postseason outing since signing a seven-year, $217 million contract to come to Boston in 2016. "To be able to do that, it feels good, for sure. I'm pumped for myself, pumped for all my teammates and coaches for us to be two wins away."	Mookie Betts had three hits for the Red Sox, who have won 14 of their last 16 World Series games dating to a four-game sweep of the St. Louis Cardinals in 2004. They have won two more championships since then, in `07 and '13.	Not bad for a team that went the previous 86 years without a title.	And Price had battled a curse of his own.	The one-time Dodgers draft pick has pitched like an ace in the regular season but was 0-9 in his first 10 postseason starts before this October. Whether with Tampa Bay, Toronto, Detroit or Boston, his team had never won a playoff game he started before this year.	But the Red Sox have now won his last three postseason starts, including the ALCS Game 5 clincher against the defending World Series champion Astros in which he pitched six shutout innings.	"I get it, the numbers and all that. But this guy is a great pitcher," Boston manager Alex Cora said. "He's been one of the best pitchers in the big leagues for a while, and he cares."	On a frigid night at Fenway Park, Price held the highest-scoring team in the NL hitless through three innings and retired the last seven batters he faced. He struggled only in the fourth, loading the bases with nobody out on two singles and a walk as the Dodgers took a 2-1 lead -- their first of the Series.	"I'm so happy for him and proud of him," Martinez said. "Going through all that criticism that he's been getting here, to bounce back to what he's been doing."	And the Red Sox batters did what they've been doing: scoring with two outs.	In an uncanny stretch of clutch hitting that's been their hallmark throughout their 108-win season, the Red Sox scored all their runs in Game 2 with two outs, including a three-run rally in the fifth that only started after Hyun-Jin Ryu set down Ian Kinsler and Jackie Bradley Jr.	Christian Vazquez singled, Betts did the same and Andrew Benintendi worked the count full before walking to load the bases, chasing Ryu. Ryan Madson walked Steve Pearce to tie the game before Martinez, who had 130 RBI in the regular season, dropped a flare in front of right fielder Yasiel Puig for a two-run single that gave Boston a 4-2 lead.	BIG FINISH	Price and three relievers retired the last 16 Los Angeles batters, with Craig Kimbrel closing out the Dodgers in the ninth for his sixth save this postseason . Not since Don Larsen's 1956 perfect game for the Yankees against the Brooklyn Dodgers has an AL team retired as many consecutive hitters to finish a World Series game, according to STATS.	"We had him. We had him on the ropes," Los Angeles manager Dave Roberts said. "The difference is they got the big hit when they needed, and we didn't."	Boston's other run came on Kinsler's two-out single in the second. The Red Sox, who led the majors in two-out runs in the regular season, have scored 36 of their 68 runs this postseason -- and nine of their 12 in the Series -- with two outs.	IN A HOLE	The last 10 teams to win the first two games of the World Series -- and 16 of the last 17 -- have gone on to win it all. And the NL West champions will need to do it against a team that has won six straight postseason games and five in a row on the road.	"We're just in the middle of the World Series," Dodgers first baseman David Freese said. "We're down 2-0, we get that. We just understand that Game 3 is a necessity, just like Game 2."	GREAT CATCH	One night after getting four hits, Red Sox left fielder Andrew Benintendi made a leaping, spread-eagle catch to rob Brian Dozier of an extra-base hit leading off the fifth. With the ball tailing away from him toward the corner, Benintendi jumped, kicked and pulled it in a few feet in front of the Green Monster scoreboard.	"Me and Mookie work on our ballet a lot, especially in spring training," Benintendi said.	Dodgers center fielder Cody Bellinger may have done him one better, sliding under Martinez's long drive to make a nice grab in the eighth.	UP NEXT	The teams head to the West Coast for Game 3 at Dodger Stadium on Friday. Rookie right-hander Walker Buehler is scheduled to pitch for Los Angeles against likely Boston starter Rick Porcello.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

After Eduardo Nunez was flipped onto his back, Alex Cora told him that even if he wanted to come out, he couldn't because the Red Sox didn't have any players to replace him. (1:22)	LOS ANGELES --  Exhausted yet exhilarated, the Dodgers headed home for a catnap. The Red Sox may well toss and turn thinking about one that got away.	Max Muncy's home run leading off the bottom of the 18th inning finally ended the longest World Series game in history early Saturday and gave Los Angeles a 3-2 victory over Boston that drew the Dodgers to 2-1 in the best-of-seven matchup.	Muncy homered to left-center on a full-count pitch from Nathan Eovaldi, jolting the remaining fans to their feet at 12:30 a.m. A grinning Muncy tossed his helmet aside as he headed for third in the final scene of a pivotal game that lasted 7 hours, 20 minutes.	"The feeling was just pure joy and incredible excitement," he said.	The Dodgers mobbed Muncy at home plate, celebrating the solo shot that pulled them back from the brink of a potential 3-0 Series deficit that no team has ever recovered from.	The Red Sox could only rue their near-miss.	They were oh-so-close in the 13th to taking a commanding Series lead. But veteran second baseman Ian Kinsler's wide throw on a two-out grounder by Yasiel Puig let Los Angeles score the tying run.	"Had the last out in my glove and couldn't get it over there. It's tough to swallow," Kinsler said.	"I feel like I let the team down right there," he said.	Said Red Sox manager Alex Cora: "It was just a bad night."	"We had some situations that we could have put them away and then we didn't. And at the end we paid the price," he said.	Evoking memories of Kirk Gibson's winning pinch-hit homer in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series, Muncy came within feet of ending it in the bottom of the 15th. But his shot to right sailed just foul and he ended up striking out.	"I really thought I had it," Muncy said. "That was kind of defeating at that point, but I was able to get back and get another shot."	The battle of attrition had a bit of everything: 46 players, including 18 pitchers, and 561 pitches. Never before had a Series game gone more than 14 innings.	Two games in one, really. And a fall classic, indeed.	"It was a must-win for us. Our guys just persevered," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.	How long did they play? Put it this way: The game took 15 minutes more than the entire 1939 World Series when the Yankees swept Cincinnati, STATS said.	Long after rookie Walker Buehler dazzled over seven shutout innings for the Dodgers, things got interesting.	The Red Sox tied it 1-all in the eighth on a homer by Jackie Bradley Jr. and took a 2-1 lead in the 13th.	Los Angeles answered with the tying run in the bottom of the inning.	After Dodgers center fielder Cody Bellinger made the throw of his life in the 10th, both teams scored on bizarre errors in the 13th.	Cora used starter David Price in relief, rotated his outfielders in the middle of innings and even put catcher Christian Vazquez at first base for the first time in his big league career.	Out of position players, Roberts called on ace Clayton Kershaw to pinch-hit in the 17th. He flied out.	The stadium organist was busy, too, launching into "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" in the 14th inning -- a second version of the seventh-inning stretch. Not many had left by then.	The crowd cheered when the stadium clock struck midnight.	"What a ballgame. What a marathon," Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner said. "Unbelievable fight from our club."	"I think my beard got about 3 inches longer."	The Dodgers snacked on peanut butter and banana sandwiches whipped up by a team employee, and hung a bag of bananas over the dugout railing to change their luck.	"We were well-fueled," Kershaw said.	Game 4 is later Saturday at Dodger Stadium. Eovaldi had been scheduled to start for the Red Sox, but he threw 97 pitches over six-plus innings in relief as one of nine pitchers they used. The Dodgers backtracked on Rich Hill and said they would announce a starter later.	"I'm a little tired, but we're ready to come back tomorrow," Los Angles slugger Yasiel Puig said, looking at his watch and adding, "in a couple of hours."	The Red Sox had a wild 13th with a walk, a steal, an infield hit and an error before taking a 2-1 lead.	Brock Holt drew a leadoff walk and stole second. Pinch-hitter Eduardo Nunez got flipped on his back by catcher Austin Barnes as he chased Scott Alexander's wild pitch.	Nunez then reached on a nubber to the right side and Alexander bungled the toss to first, allowing Holt to score. Nunez got knocked on his back again on the play at first, but stayed in the game as Boston had no one left on its bench.	The Dodgers tied it 2-all in the bottom of the 13th. Muncy drew a leadoff walk and tagged up when Nunez tumbled into the third base stands after catching Bellinger's pop foul. Muncy scored when Kinsler botched the throw to first on Puig's infield single.	Bradley Jr. tied it at 1 with a drive off closer Kenley Jansen in the eighth.	The Dodgers led 1-0 on Joc Pederson's two-out homer in the third.	Both teams squandered numerous chances. The Red Sox stranded runners in the 10th and 11th. The Dodgers left runners on in every inning from the fifth to the 11th.	Boston had runners at the corners in the 10th. Pedro Baez walked J.D. Martinez with one out and took third on Holt's single to center.	Bellinger started a sensational, inning-ending double play from center field, catching Nunez's pinch-hit fly and then firing to catcher Austin Barnes a few feet up the third-base line. Barnes made the tag as Kinsler came barreling past and both players tumbled to the dirt.	The game began in 78-degree heat -- 31 degrees warmer than at Fenway Park for the first two games.	Buehler stymied the Red Sox through seven innings. The right-hander retired his final 14 batters before leaving after 108 pitches. He allowed two hits, struck out seven and didn't walk anyone.	"He's got an overt confidence, a quiet confidence, a little combo," Roberts said. "But he's got tremendous stuff, and he lives for moments like this."	Boston starter Rick Porcello gave up one run and three hits in 4 2/3 innings. He struck out five and walked one.	Alex Wood threw a hitless inning for the win.	ALL NIGHT LONG	Previously, the longest postseason game by time was San Francisco's 18-inning win over Washington that took 6 hours, 23 minutes, during the 2014 NL Division Series. The only other playoff game to last 18 innings was Houston's victory over Atlanta in the 2005 NLDS.	STREAK STOPPERS	The Red Sox had won six straight games, starting in the ALCS. They had been 5-0 on the road this postseason.	UP NEXT	Red Sox: Cora hadn't decided on a Game 4 starter.	Dodgers: After the game, the team said its starter would be announced later. Left-hander Rich Hill had been set to go.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.

Dave Roberts explains his decision to remove Rich Hill in the seventh inning and looks ahead to the Dodgers' tall task for the rest of the World Series. (0:49)	LOS ANGELES --  An 18-inning loss in Game 3 of the World Series couldn't wear out the Boston Red Sox. A four-run deficit late in Game 4 definitely didn't faze them.	This plucky powerhouse just kept getting big hits to move to the brink of another championship.	Steve Pearce hit a tying homer in the eighth inning and a three-run double in the ninth, and the Red Sox emphatically rallied for a 9-6 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Saturday.	Pinch-hitter Rafael Devers singled home Brock Holt with the tiebreaking run in the ninth as Boston roared to a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven matchup.	Less than a day after a wrenching, 440-minute defeat ended well past midnight, the Red Sox trailed 4-0 in the seventh inning before they shook off that heartbreak, warmed up their bats and sped away from LA.	"I've never been on a team where you just get punched in the face and then come back tomorrow and act like they are totally fine," Red Sox slugger J.D. Martinez said. "It's impressive."	Game 5 is Sunday at Dodger Stadium, where the Red Sox can close out a spectacular season with their fourth title in 15 years. Boston picked Game 2 winner David Price to start on short rest over Chris Sale against fellow lefty Clayton Kershaw.	Soon after Yasiel Puig's three-run homer in the sixth put the Dodgers up by four, Boston's incredible surge began with pinch-hitter Mitch Moreland's three-run homer in the seventh. By the time they were done decimating the Dodgers' bullpen, six Red Sox had combined for seven hits -- four for extra bases.	"It was just a great night, all the way around," Pearce said. "A great team win. A much-needed win, especially after what happened (in Game 3). I just love this team's fight."	The Red Sox scored just two runs in their first 24 innings at Dodger Stadium, but added nine more in the final three innings of Game 4. Sale's motivational screams in the dugout might have played a role, but whatever the reason, Boston responded splendidly to a perilous situation.	"Sometimes in October we talk about mechanics, and how you feel at the plate and all that, (but) sometimes it's will," rookie manager Alex Cora said. "You will yourself to do great things. And it started very simple. A few good at-bats, and then the big swing, and we kept rolling and we didn't stop playing."	The Red Sox overcame a three-run deficit in a World Series game for the second time. Boston also rallied from three down against Cincinnati in 1975 in Game 6, best known for Carlton Fisk's dramatic homer in the 12th after Bernie Carbo tied it with a three-run shot.	Pearce was an unlikely candidate to join that lineage as the latest postseason hero in Boston's long October history, but the 12-year veteran acquired in June did it twice.	The 35-year-old journeyman connected off All-Star closer Kenley Jansen for a tying homer in the eighth, and cleared the bases one inning later with a double to the gap. Pearce joined Carl Yastrzemski in 1967 and David Ortiz in 2004 as the only Boston players to homer while driving in four runs in a World Series game.	"(Puig's homer) was a big blow, but everybody was pulling for each other, trying to get each other riled up," Pearce said. "This team has a lot of fight, and it was great to see how we responded. Our offense went silent for about 20-plus innings, so our pitchers did a great job."	The superlative Boston roster that won 108 regular-season games and then rolled through the 100-win New York Yankees and defending champion Houston Astros to win the AL pennant is now one win from this formerly tormented franchise's ninth World Series crown.	Enrique Hernandez hit a two-run homer in the ninth for Los Angeles, which could become the first team to lose the World Series on its home field in back-to-back seasons since the New York Giants lost at the Polo Grounds to the Yankees in 1936 and 1937. The Dodgers' bullpen flopped after manager Dave Roberts pulled starter Rich Hill, who dazzled for 6 1/3 innings of one-hit ball.	Los Angeles must overcome a 3-1 deficit to end its 30-year championship drought. Only six teams have accomplished the feat in a best-of-seven World Series, although the Chicago Cubs did it just two years ago.	"We're not out yet," Roberts said. "Our guys aren't done. We've got our best going tomorrow and we're expecting to win a baseball game."	Less than 17 hours after Max Muncy's 18th-inning homer for the Dodgers ended the longest game in World Series history at 7 hours, 20 minutes, the teams were back on the field in Chavez Ravine. Game 4 took only 3 hours, 57 minutes, but had at least as many twists and turns.	After Hill left to a standing ovation, Boston's feast on the Dodgers' relievers began. By the time the Red Sox were done, all five relievers used by Roberts had yielded at least one run.	Moreland got the comeback started with his three-run shot off Ryan Madson -- only Boston's second hit of the game -- after Xander Bogaerts and Holt walked.	Pearce then repeated the Game 3 feat of Jackie Bradley Jr., who also hit a tying homer in the eighth off Jansen. The longtime Dodgers closer has three blown saves and an extra-inning loss during the past two World Series.	Dodger Stadium was already rumbling with tension and fear when Holt doubled in the ninth off losing pitcher Dylan Floro. Devers sent him home with a go-ahead single -- and three batters later, Pearce cleared the bases.	After Pearce arrived at second and Martinez was intentionally walked, Martinez used his hands to make a heart and mouthed "I love you!" to Pearce. Both players cracked up.	Pearce even scored Boston's ninth run on Bogaerts' single, celebrating wildly with teammates in somnolent Chavez Ravine.	Devers added a big defensive play in the ninth when he slid to stop Manny Machado's hard grounder behind third before throwing across the diamond for the second out. Craig Kimbrel retired Cody Bellinger to end it, leaving Puig in the on-deck circle.	After throwing six pitches in relief the night before, left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez largely stymied the Dodgers until giving up Puig's homer in the sixth. Rodriguez slammed his glove on the mound in frustration.	Los Angeles opened the scoring on a throwing error by catcher Christian Vazquez.	Joe Kelly was the winner after tossing two shutout innings.	HOLLYWOOD LIGHTS	The stands were packed with iconic Los Angeles athletes from Sandy Koufax and Magic Johnson to Kobe Bryant, who read the Dodgers' starting lineup before watching from the front row in a Machado jersey.  Hollywood luminaries also attended, including Charlize Theron, Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, James Franco, Don Johnson and Rob Lowe. For the first pitch, Dennis Eckersley took the mound in an Athletics jersey for a toss to Kirk Gibson, whose game-ending homer off Eck in the 1988 World Series still looms larger than Muncy's drive in Dodgers history.	STARTING FROM ZERO	Rodriguez, who threw 93 pitches, became the first pitcher to start a World Series game on zero days' rest since Firpo Marberry for the Washington Senators in 1924.	UP NEXT	Red Sox: Price gave up two runs and three hits over six innings in Game 2 for his second consecutive postseason win. He also pitched in relief in Game 3.	Dodgers: Kershaw makes his fourth World Series start. He was charged with five runs and seven hits over four-plus innings in a Game 1 loss at Boston.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

Mark Teixeira and David Ross talk about the Red Sox winning the World Series and how this team was counted out even though Boston had the best record. (0:43)	LOS ANGELES --  Chris Sale's final pitch for this Boston juggernaut triggered a celebration on the Dodger Stadium infield, among thousands of fans who made their way to California -- and even outside Fenway Park back home.	The quest is complete. Yes, these 2018 Red Sox really are that great.	A team to remember from top to bottom. A season to savor from start to finish.	David Price proved his postseason mettle, Steve Pearce homered twice and Boston beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-1 on Sunday to finish off a one-sided World Series in five games.	A tormented franchise during decades of despair before ending an 86-year championship drought in 2004, the Red Sox have become baseball's team of the century with four titles in 15 seasons.	"Seeing all these grown men over there, just acting like kids, that's what it's all about," Price said after pitching three-hit ball into the eighth inning on short rest. "This is why I came to Boston."	After losing on opening day, Alex Cora's team romped to a 17-2 start and a club-record 108 wins, then went 11-3 in the postseason, dispatching the 100-win New York Yankees and the 103-victory and defending champion Houston Astros in the playoffs. Cora, a player on Boston's 2007 champions, became the first manager from Puerto Rico to win a title and just the fifth rookie skipper overall.	"I don't know where we stand in history and all that," said Dave Dombrowski, the club's president of baseball operations. "If somebody would say you're going to win 119 games and lose 57, we'd never, ever fathom that."	Pearce hit a two-run homer on Clayton Kershaw's sixth pitch. Solo homers by Mookie Betts in the sixth inning and J.D. Martinez in the seventh quieted the Los Angeles crowd. Pearce added a solo drive off Pedro Baez in the eighth, then was selected the Series MVP after the game.	"Best feeling in my life," Pearce said.	Acquired in June from Toronto, Pearce had three homers and seven RBI in the final 11 innings of the Series. Thousands of Boston fans remained on the first-base side of the stadium long after the final out, chanting "Let's go Red Sox!" and singing "Sweet Caroline."	Of course, they let loose a few choice words about the rival Yankees, too.	"I never knew there were so many Red Sox fans here," Martinez said.	Players' families, many dressed in red, congregated on the field to join the celebration, some holding babies, some watching children run across the outfield in glee.	"This is the greatest Red Sox team in history," owner John Henry proclaimed after receiving the Series trophy.	After losing to Houston in Game 7 last year by the same 5-1 score, the Dodgers became the first team ousted on its home field in consecutive World Series since the New York Giants by the New York Yankees at the Polo Grounds in 1936 and `37. Los Angeles remains without a championship since 1988.	"Ran up against a very good ballclub -- and just a little bit too much for us," said manager Dave Roberts, who played for Boston's 2004 champions.	Boston outscored the Dodgers 28-16 and had only a slightly better batting average at .222 to .180. But the Red Sox got timely hitting and won their ninth title, tying the Athletics for third-most behind the Yankees (27) and Cardinals (11).	All that stood between the Red Sox and a sweep was an 18-inning loss in Game 3, the longest World Series game ever. They trailed 4-0 in the seventh inning of Game 4 when Sale rose from the dugout bench for a fiery, profane, motivational rant, and his teammates woke up in time to rally for a 9-6 win.	Boston never trailed in Game 5.	"I didn't say anything that anyone didn't know," Sale explained. "Just rallying the troops and letting them know -- we're the best team on the planet, and to start playing like it."	The 33-year-old Price, a Cy Young Award winner in 2012, long pitched under an October shadow cast by his regular-season success. He had been 0-9 in 11 postseason starts before defeating Astros ace Justin Verlander in the clinching Game 5 of the AL Championship Series. The left-hander won his third straight start Sunday and became the first pitcher to beat Cy Young winners in the finale of an LCS and the World Series in the same year.	"I've been through a lot in three years since I came here, but this is why I came," said Price, who like Kershaw can opt out of his lucrative contract in the coming days and become a free agent.	After allowing two runs over six innings to win Game 2 last Wednesday, Price got two outs in the ninth inning of Friday's marathon game. He became the first to pitch into the eighth inning of a Series game on one day of rest since the Yankees' Bob Turley in 1957.	"All the haters, it's time to be quiet and show the guy some respect," Martinez said.	Price gave up a home run to David Freese on his first pitch , then allowed just two more hits -- the last a triple to Freese that Martinez lost in the third-inning twilight and allowed to drop behind him on the right field warning track. Price struck out five and walked two, retiring 14 in a row before a leadoff walk to Chris Taylor in the eighth ended his night after 89 pitches. He tapped his heart several times to Red Sox fans behind the first base dugout while walking to the bench.	Joe Kelly struck out three straight pinch hitters and Sale, originally scheduled to start Game 5, fanned three more in the ninth. Sale ended by throwing a slider past a falling Manny Machado, a meager 4 for 22 (.182) in the Series, and raised both arms. Boston catcher Christian Vazquez ran out to jump on him with glee, and teammates from the dugout and bullpens followed.	While Price rewrote his own October legacy, Kershaw was unable to do the same as he fell to 1-4 with a 6.06 ERA in postseason elimination games. Plagued at times by an aching back, the 30-year-old lefty no longer is the dominant pitcher who won three Cy Young Awards, his famous 12-to-6 breaking ball now more 10 to 4:30.	Kershaw allowed four runs and seven hits -- three of them homers -- in seven innings. He is 9-10 with a 4.32 ERA in 30 postseason appearances, a huge drop from his 153-69 record and 2.39 ERA during the regular season.	"It just hurts worse when you make it all the way and get second place," he said.	Kershaw began aggressively, throwing strikes on his first six pitches, and the Red Sox were ready.	Andrew Benintendi hit a one-out single and Pearce pulled a fastball over the middle of the plate and sent it 405 feet into the left-field pavilion.	While the crowd of 54,367 was stunned, Freese woke up fans in the bottom half. He drove Price's first pitch 402 feet to the opposite field and into the right field pavilion.	Betts homered on a slider that stayed in the strike zone after going 0 for 13 in Los Angeles this weekend, the first postseason home run of his career coming in his 87th at-bat. Martinez homered in the seventh, driving a fastball to straightway center.	By then, Red Sox fans had started planning for the April 9 home opener against Toronto, when the championship flag will be raised over Fenway after Boston opens with an 11-game trip out West.	"It wasn't as easy as what people think," Cora said.	STAY AHEAD	Boston went 7-1 on the road in the postseason and 10-0 overall when scoring first.	I'M STILL HERE	Shortstop Xander Bogaerts was the only active player on the Red Sox from their 2013 championship team.	SPEND IT TO MAKE IT	Boston is the first team with the highest payroll to win the title since the 2009 Yankees.	JUST LIKE LAST YEAR	Cora celebrated on the same field where he earned a ring last year as the Astros' bench coach.	Visiting clubhouse manager Mitch Poole estimates he ordered 263 bottles of champagne for the Red Sox, at an estimated cost of $18,000.	"The visiting team always pays the bill," he said.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.
