PHILADELPHIA --  Just like the old days, Carlos Ruiz soaked in the adoring cheers after another clutch hit.	It didn't matter he was a visiting player.	Ruiz hit a three-run double against his old team, Robinson Cano and Danny Valencia homered and the Seattle Mariners beat the Philadelphia Phillies 11-6 Wednesday.	Ruiz earned another standing ovation a day after he returned and was honored with a video tribute that highlighted his career with the Phillies. The former All-Star catcher was 3 for 30 this season before clearing the bases with a liner off the left-field wall in the seventh inning.	"I kind of feel like my legs were not on the ground, it was real special," Ruiz said. "That was huge for my team and also to see the ovation from the fans, their support, and I said thank you to them, because they were real good to me when I was here, and I'm so happy that they do that."	Seattle swept the two-game interleague series after rallying from a pair of four-run deficits in a 10-9 win Tuesday.	Tony Zych (2-0) tossed a scoreless inning after Yovani Gallardo allowed three runs and four hits in five innings.	Aaron Altherr hit two homers and Tommy Joseph also went deep for the Phillies, who have lost 10 of 12. Altherr has three-run homers in three straight games.	"He's relentless," Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said. "He's swinging the ball as well as I've seen a guy swing."	Robinson Cano led off the seventh with a single off Joaquin Benoit (0-2). After Kyle Seager walked, Danny Valencia lined an RBI double to right to give the Mariners a 4-3 lead. Guillermo Heredia flied out and Jarrod Dyson was intentionally walked, setting the stage for Ruiz.	His liner, which missed being a grand slam by a few feet, extended Seattle's lead to 7-3. Fans chanted "Choooch!" and cheered the same way they did for Chase Utley when he hit two homers against the Phillies in his return to Philadelphia last August.	Ruiz caught the final out of the 2008 World Series and spent his entire career in Philadelphia before a trade to the Los Angeles Dodgers last summer.	"That was really special to come to Philadelphia and get the ovation the fans gave to me," he said.	Cano drove one out to the opposite field in left for a 3-0 lead in the third. Valencia connected in the eighth.	"What an offensive day," Mariners manager Scott Servais said. "(We) put that nice inning together against Benoit, obviously we know him, but our guys did grind out some at-bats, got some big hits."	BACK TO THE FARM	RHP Jake Thompson was optioned by the Phillies to Triple-A Lehigh Valley after the game. He struggled in three relief appearances and will return to his role as a starter. The team hasn't yet announced a corresponding roster move.	STARTING TIME	Philadelphia's Zach Eflin gave up three runs and nine hits in six innings, pitching out of trouble often throughout the afternoon.	"I didn't have my best stuff, but I was able to battle," Eflin said.	STREAKING	Seattle has won four straight and six of seven to even its record (17-17) for the first time since the opener.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: RHP Hisashi Iwakuma was placed on the 10-day disabled list because of right shoulder inflammation. He became the fourth starter to be sidelined by injury.	Phillies: RHP Aaron Nola is to make a rehab start Thursday for Triple-A Lehigh Valley. Nola (2-0, 4.50 ERA) is on a 60-pitch limit.	UP NEXT	Mariners: RHP Chase De Jong (0-2, 6.75 ERA) pitches Thursday at Toronto in the opener of a four-game series. RHP Marco Estrada (1-2, 3.14) goes for the Blue Jays.	Phillies: After hosting their annual charity festival at Citizens Bank Park on Thursday, the Phillies open a three-game series at Washington on Friday. RHP Nick Pivetta (0-2, 5.40) starts.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

NEW YORK --  In dire need of a break, the San Francisco Giants got one.	Christian Arroyo snapped a ninth-inning tie with a three-run double and the Giants took advantage of a critical error by third baseman Wilmer Flores, rallying past the New York Mets 6-5 on Wednesday to stop a five-game losing streak.	"Yeah, big win," Buster Posey said. "Go home with some momentum and hopefully keep it going."	Hunter Pence hit a tying single off closer Jeurys Familia in a four-run ninth that gave the Giants (12-23) their third victory in 11 games. Posey homered again and scored three runs for San Francisco, which headed home from a 3-6 trip with the worst record in the majors.	Since a comeback win over Miami in May 2015, the Giants had lost 133 straight games when trailing after eight innings -- the longest streak in franchise history.	"Today, the ball bounced our way," second baseman Joe Panik said.	Flores nearly tied the score with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, driving a two-run double off the top of the left-center fence for his third hit.	Derek Law, subbing for injured closer Mark Melancon, retired Kevin Plawecki on a dribbler in front of home plate for his second save .	"It's good experience for Law to be in that situation," manager Bruce Bochy said. "But I'll mix it up with the closing."	Left-hander Tommy Milone hit an RBI single and was in position to win his Mets debut before San Francisco fought back.	Panik drew a one-out walk from Familia (1-1), and Eduardo Nunez hit a sharp grounder to third. With a chance to start a game-ending double play, Flores bobbled the ball and rushed a high throw to second base.	"I was just trying to catch it. Once I knocked it down, I didn't put myself in a good position to make a good throw to second base," Flores said. "Just a little mistake cost us the game."	Both runners were safe, and Pence followed with an RBI single through the left side.	After a walk to Posey, the 21-year-old Arroyo cleared the bases with a line drive to left-center and was fired up at second base.	"I think it was just a lot of frustration, a lot of pent-up aggression. It went our way one time," he said.	Familia, booed as he left the mound, was working for the third consecutive day -- including a 6-1 victory Tuesday night.	The right-hander had thrown only 15 pitches combined in the previous two outings.	"He's used to coming back-to-back-to-back," Mets manager Terry Collins said. "That was not the issue. He didn't have his command."	Bryan Morris (1-0) tossed 1 1/3 scoreless innings.	Jay Bruce homered and Curtis Granderson hit an early RBI double for the Mets, who led 3-1 before Justin Ruggiano's bases-loaded sacrifice fly for San Francisco in the sixth.	"Those types of wins can turn things around. It's probably just what we needed," Ruggiano said. "Finally, we broke through. I think we all were ready to take a big exhale and smile a little bit."	Giants starter Matt Cain allowed three runs -- two earned -- in five innings.	NEW YORK STATE OF MIND	Posey homered in every game of the series, connecting in three straight for the third time in his career and first since June 2013. He is batting .345 with 10 homers and 25 RBI in 39 career games against the Mets. "I feel like I see the ball well here. It's a good batter's eye," Posey said. "I enjoy playing here."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Giants: SS Brandon Crawford (strained groin) is expected to come off the disabled list Thursday and play against Cincinnati. ... CF Denard Span (sprained shoulder) was scheduled to play seven innings in his second rehab game with Class A San Jose. ... A day after Melancon (forearm) was placed on the 10-day disabled list, RHP Reyes Moronta was recalled from Double-A to replenish the bullpen. ... Slumping 1B Brandon Belt was rested against the lefty. He flied out as a pinch hitter with a runner on second to end the eighth, leaving Belt in slides of 0 for 18 and 3 for 31.	Mets: Hot-hitting LF Michael Conforto didn't start to rest his tight hamstring for two days in a row, including Thursday's off day. He had a pinch-hit single in the eighth. ... SS Asdrubal Cabrera was held out of the lineup for one more day to rest aching legs. Cabrera hasn't started since hurting his left thumb on a dive last Saturday, but that seems to be better. He pinch hit for the third straight game and struck out with the bases loaded and one out in the sixth. ... 1B Lucas Duda (hyperextended left elbow) is expected to come off the DL on the team's upcoming road trip, Collins said. He hopes to get Duda back this weekend in Milwaukee.	UP NEXT	Giants: LHP Ty Blach (0-2, 5.66 ERA) starts Thursday night against Reds RHP Bronson Arroyo (3-2, 6.53) when San Francisco opens a seven-game homestand. Blach gave up 10 runs and 11 hits, both career highs, in three innings last Saturday at Cincinnati.	Mets: RHP Matt Harvey (2-2, 5.14 ERA) pitches Friday in Milwaukee, his first start since serving a three-day suspension imposed by the team for skipping Saturday's game against Miami following a late night on the town. "It's a big hurdle for him," Collins said. The former ace is coming off two of the worst outings of his career in a pair of losses to Atlanta. RHP Matt Garza (1-0, 2.55) goes for the Brewers.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

HOUSTON --  Carlos Correa has developed a knack this season for coming up with big hits with two outs.	He did it again on Wednesday when he had two doubles and two RBI to help the Houston Astros to a 4-2 win over the Atlanta Braves that gave them the best 34-game start in franchise history.	The Astros had two outs and two on in the fifth when Correa's double off Jaime Garcia (1-2) landed in the left-field corner to score two runners for a 3-2 lead.	"I was just trying to get a good pitch to hit He hung a slider over the middle of the plate and I was able to drive it for us to take the lead," Correa said.	Garcia walked Evan Gattis, and Yuli Gurriel's single scored Correa.	Eight of Correa's 17 RBI this season have come with two outs. After hitting just .233 with two homers and eight RBI in April he's heated up this month to bat .344 with two homers and seven RBI in just nine games.	"The proof is out there every day when he's starting to contribute every game," manager A.J. Hinch said. "I know he had a little bit of a rough start to the season but I think him being up in the middle of the order with the game on the line is exactly what he thrives in."	Houston (23-11) swept the two-game interleague matchup in its first series victory over the Braves since winning two of three from May 1-3, 1999.	Joe Musgrove (2-3) allowed two runs and four hits in six innings, and Ken Giles pitched a perfect ninth for his ninth save in 10 chances.	Garcia tied a season-high with four runs in six innings, giving up six hits.	Freddie Freeman and Adonis Garcia hit solo homers to give Atlanta a 2-1 lead in the fourth, but the Braves couldn't string many together hits after that and tied a season high with their sixth straight loss.	"It's a rough go right now on everything if you get right down to it," manager Brian Snitker said. "We just got to keep grinding and working and eventually you handle something like this and good things will happen on the other end of it."	Dansby Swanson and Emilio Bonifacio hit back-to-back singles in the eighth, but Will Harris struck out three of the next four batters to escape the jam.	Musgrove, who had given up four runs in the first inning in two of his previous three starts, kept the Braves off the board until Freeman opened the fourth inning by hitting his 12th home run . Freeman is the fifth player in franchise history to hit 12 homers in the first 31 games and the first since Justin Upton did it in 2013.	Matt Kemp followed with a single to extend his hitting streak to 11 games, but he was erased when Nick Markakis grounded into a double play.	Jake Marisnick singled with two outs in the third inning and stole second base. The Astros took a 1-0 lead when he scored on a double by George Springer.	MAKEUP GAME SET	The Braves will make up a game their home game with the Mets that was postponed last Thursday because of rain on June 10. The game will be part of a double-header with the first game starting at 1:05 p.m. and the second one, which was originally scheduled to start at 4:10 p.m., being pushed back to 6:05 p.m.	THEY SAID IT	Kemp on the Atlanta's struggles with runners in scoring position: "We've got to get those big hits. Maybe if we get something going like that it will get us back on track. But we're just not getting those timely hits and getting runners out. We're not doing anything right at the moment."	UP NEXT	Braves: Atlanta has an off day on Thursday before opening a three-game series at Miami on Friday. Mike Foltynewicz (0-4, 4.55) will try and bounce back and get his first win this season after allowing nine hits and seven runs -- both season highs -- in four innings of a 10-0 loss to St. Louis in his last outing.	Astros: Ace Dallas Keuchel will try and improve to 6-0 when he starts the opener of a four-game series against the Yankees on Thursday night. Keuchel has a 1.88 ERA and seems to have put a tough 2016 behind him when he went 9-12 with a 4.55 ERA in the follow-up to his 2015 AL Cy Young Award-winning season.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

DENVER --  German Marquez's fastball was dancing. His curve, almost untouchable. And after a diving catch by Carlos Gonzalez in the sixth, well, Marquez's mind couldn't help but wonder.	"I thought about it," Marquez said of a no-hitter.	That's how electric his command was.	Marquez allowed three hits over eight innings and got his first major league hit with a two-run single in the seventh to lead the Colorado Rockies over the Chicago Cubs 3-0 on Wednesday.	"For a young man against the world champions to do this, I mean, pretty special game," said Rockies manager Bud Black, whose team is off to its best 35-game start at 22-13.	Marquez had a no-hit bid going until Kris Bryant's double leading off the seventh. He walked Kyle Schwarber in the first and retired 16 straight before Bryant's hit to left.	The 22-year-old Marquez (1-2) struck out eight by mixing in a mid-90s fastball with an assortment of breaking pitches. The Cubs acknowledged they didn't know much about him before.	"You have to give the kid credit -- he was on today and we had nothing to show for it," Bryant said.	With two on and two outs in the seventh, Marquez broke open the game with his liner to left on an 0-2 pitch left up. The Rockies bench gave him an ovation.	"I didn't look at that pitch, just swung," explained Marquez, who had the ball sitting on his shelf at his locker.	Greg Holland threw a perfect ninth for his 14th save in as many chances to help the Rockies take two of three from Chicago.	"That's how you draw it up: Get (Marquez) through eight, throw it to your closer, game over," catcher Ryan Hanigan said. "That was a great win for our pitching staff."	Kyle Hendricks (2-2) gave up three runs -- two earned -- in 6 1/3 innings.	"Just one of those days for us," Hendricks said.	Ian Desmond hit a go-ahead sacrifice fly in the fourth that was set up by an error. After Nolan Arenado's one-out single, Gonzalez sent a grounder to shortstop Javier Baez, who mishandled it. Mark Reynolds drew a walk, and Desmond lifted a ball to center.	"The game should have been 0-0. We made the one mistake at shortstop and the unlikely single by the pitcher on an 0-2 count," Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. "Wow."	Marquez was recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque on April 25 to fill in with Jon Gray sidelined by an injury. Marquez struggled in his first two starts at Coors Field this season, posting an 11.70 ERA.	He found his masterful control Wednesday after a rain delay of 50 minutes at the start. It's the sixth time a Rockies pitcher has thrown at least six innings of no-hit baseball at Coors Field and first since Jorge De La Rosa on May 16, 2014, according to Elias Sports Bureau.	Marquez found himself in a tight spot in the eighth with two on and one out. Black showed faith in him to escape and he did, too, by getting two groundouts to end the threat.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: SS Addison Russell was a late scratch with soreness in his right shoulder. "He felt better through the course of the game," Maddon said after the game.	Rockies: C Tony Wolters (concussion) is taking swings in the batting cage. "I feel good," Wolters said.	PUT HIM IN, COACH	Third base on Tuesday, first base on Wednesday -- Jeimer Candelario doesn't care where he plays. He was recalled from Triple-A Iowa on Tuesday as the 26th player before the second game of a doubleheader, but was kept around. Instead, pitcher Dylan Floro was sent back to Triple-A Iowa.	SCUFFLING CUBS	The loss drops the Cubs to 17-17 this season. It's been a crazy past few days for the Cubs, who've endured an 18-inning loss to the New York Yankees and then a day-night doubleheader Tuesday after a rainout the day before.	"This is kind of our worst baseball right now," Bryant said. "We're not hitting the panic button at all. We know the talent we have here."	UP NEXT	Cubs: Off Thursday before a three-game series in St. Louis. Maddon has yet to announce a start for Friday's game.	Rockies: LHP Tyler Anderson (2-3, 6.69 ERA) takes the mound Thursday against the Los Angeles Dodgers.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- Athletics manager Bob Melvin resisted the urge to telephone the bullpen to get someone warming up after starter Andrew Triggs walked his first three batters on 14 pitches.	It turned out to be the best call Melvin didn't make.	Triggs bounced back from his shaky start to pitch six innings, Chad Pinder homered and Oakland held on to beat the Los Angeles Angels 3-1 on Wednesday.	"Wow, that was Houdini," Melvin said after his club completed a 4-2 homestand. "It's one guy away from getting somebody up in the first inning. And then give us six innings and nothing else. I wouldn't say I wasn't expecting it, but it was Houdini-like. It ended up being a great outing for him."	After Triggs (5-2) walked the bases loaded, he struck out Luis Valbuena, allowed Jefry Marte to hit into a run-scoring forceout and escaped further trouble when Ben Revere flied out on his 27th pitch.	He wound up giving up three hits and pitched out of trouble repeatedly on an afternoon the Angels went 0 for 8 with runners in scoring position.	"It was kind of bizarre, but the ball was dancing on me a little bit," Triggs said. "I didn't make the adjustment quick enough, but I'm glad I was able to before things got out of hand there."	Liam Hendriks, Ryan Madson and Santiago Casilla finished the four-hitter, with Casilla striking out his first two batters in a one-hit ninth for his sixth save in seven chances.	Jesse Chavez (2-5) allowed two runs and three hits over 5 2/3 innings in the first start against his former club. The Angels were without sluggers Mike Trout and Albert Pujols.	"Jesse really pitched a strong game," Los Angeles manager Mike Scioscia said. "A broken-bat base hit, and then Pinder launched one that got up in the jet stream. I think at night time no way would that ball going to carry. He pitched really well for us."	Mark Canha had two of Oakland's five hits in his first start since returning from the minors, and Khris Davis added an RBI single that helped the A's to their fourth win in five games.	Pinder hit a two-run homer in the fifth following Mark Canha's leadoff single. The A's second baseman also had to extend to make a running catch on Juan Graterol's liner up the middle, ending the seventh.	Oakland had lost six of the previous nine games between the teams this season.	NO BACKUP	Backup catcher Bruce Maxwell left as a precaution after taking a foul tip off his facemask in the first inning. It was the third time Maxwell has been hit in the past week. That left the A's with no one behind Stephen Vogt, who took over after Maxwell left in the fourth inning. Melvin, a major league catcher for 10 years, was asked after the game who the A's would have turned to in an emergency. "Me," he deadpanned before noting infielders Adam Rosales and Trevor Plouffe were his options.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: Trout (left hamstring) missed his fifth consecutive game but manager Mike Scioscia is hopeful the center fielder will be in the lineup Thursday. Pujols was given the day off. C.J. Cron, who was hit in the right wrist by a pitch earlier this week, is expected to hit off a tee Thursday.	Athletics: LHP Sean Manaea (left shoulder strain) allowed one run over four innings with five strikeouts in a rehab start with Triple-A Nashville on Wednesday. ... RHP John Axford threw batting practice before the game and is to begin a rehab assignment Saturday.	UP NEXT	Angels: RHP JC Ramirez (3-2) is to start against Detroit on Thursday in the opener of a seven-game homestand. He has a 0.69 ERA in two starts at Angels Stadium this season.	Athletics: RHP Jesse Hahn (1-2) may be pitching for his spot in the rotation when Oakland begins a three-game series in Texas on Friday following an off day.

MIAMI --  Bob Gibson, Stan Musial, Dizzy Dean and Rogers Hornsby never had a trip with the Cardinals like the one they completed Wednesday night.	Dexter Fowler hit a pinch-hit, go-ahead triple and St. Louis overcame a four-run deficit for the second game in a row, rallying past Miami 7-5 to conclude a trip that by one measure ranked as the franchise's best ever.	The Cardinals went 6-0 on their swing through Atlanta and Miami. It's the first time they've gone undefeated on a trip of at least six games in their 126-year history, the team said, citing information from Elias.	"That's hard to believe with some of the great teams that have been through here," manager Mike Matheny said. "That's a pretty impressive statement."	Lance Lynn gave up four runs in the first inning on homers by Christian Yelich and Justin Bour, but for the second consecutive game, Fowler came off the bench to give the Cardinals the lead. His two-run triple in the sixth put them ahead to stay, 5-4.	Fowler, out of the starting lineup for the past six games because of a sore lat, drove in the winning run in the ninth inning Tuesday after St. Louis rallied from a 5-1 eighth-inning deficit.	"I love the result and what it takes to come from behind like that, but the club can't keep doing that," Matheny said. "It just beats everybody up. But it's huge to have that capability. Not every team does."	The Cardinals' six-game winning streak is their longest since June 2015, and they have won nine consecutive road games. They have recovered from a 3-9 start to climb into the NL Central lead, and they are a season-high five games above .500 (19-14).	Jedd Gyorko had three hits and two RBI, scored a run and stole a base for St. Louis. Rookie sensation Magneuris Sierra singled, walked and scored twice.	"Even when we were down four, it was so early," first baseman Matt Carpenter said. "We felt like the way we've been swinging the bat, we were going to have a chance. Our lineup right now is pretty dangerous, so four runs didn't feel like we were that far behind."	Miami's Tom Koehler couldn't hold the early lead, allowing four runs in 5 1/3 innings. Jarlin Garcia (0-1) gave up two runs in the sixth for the Marlins, who have blown leads of four runs or more to lose three times in the past week.	"It seems we're finding new ways every night to lose a game," Koehler said. "It's tough. We have to find a way to snap out of it."	The Marlins were shorthanded after losing four players on the left side of their infield since Sunday to injuries. Two-time All-Star second baseman Dee Gordon started at shortstop for the first time since 2013 and handled four chances.	Lynn needed 104 pitches to get through four innings, his shortest outing of the season. He left trailing 4-3 and his ERA rose from 2.04, second-best in the NL, to 2.75.	But Lynn and six relievers limited Miami to one run over the final 8 1/3 innings. Sam Tuivailala (2-0) pitched a scoreless fifth, and Seung Hwan Oh escaped a two-on, no-out situation in the ninth for his ninth save.	"We pitch well, and when we don't pitch well, the offense picks us up," Lynn said. "That's how winning teams do it. You turn it up when you need to."	COMPLETE GAME	Marlins manager Don Mattingly went the distance after being ejected early in each of the first two games of the series. He said his wife videotaped their 2-year-old son, Louis, imitating Dad arguing with an umpire. "She sent me a video of Louis moving his hands all over the place," Mattingly said. "That was cute. I guess my hands move around. People have told me that before. The fact he notices it is a little scary."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: CF Fowler is expected to rejoin the starting lineup Friday against the Cubs.	Marlins: RHP Edinson Volquez (blister) and LHP Wei-Yin Chen (tired arm) threw bullpen sessions. Volquez remains on schedule to start Saturday against the Braves, while Chen won't start before Tuesday at the earliest, Mattingly said.	UP NEXT	Cardinals: St. Louis opens an 11-day, eight-game home stand Friday when NL ERA leader Mike Leake (4-1, 1.79) starts against the Cubs.	Marlins: RHP Jose Urena (1-0, 1.69) is scheduled to make his second start of the season at home Friday against the Braves.	---	More AP baseball: apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

WASHINGTON --  Baltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter thought he would be seeing the last of the Washington Nationals on Thursday night.	A persistent rain changed all that.	The final game of the home-and-home interleague series between Baltimore and the Nationals was postponed by rain, meaning these neighboring rivals -- located 38 miles apart -- aren't quite done with each other this season.	The makeup for Thursday night's washout has been scheduled for June 8 at 7:05 p.m.	For three straight nights, two of the best teams in the majors engaged in competitive, back-and-forth duels.	Washington, which owns the best record in the National League, lost 6-4 on Monday night in Baltimore and blew a late lead Tuesday in 5-4, 12-inning defeat at Camden Yards.	Those two victories gave the Orioles the best record in the majors, a distinction that vanished with a 7-6 loss on Wednesday night in which the host Nationals rallied with a three-run ninth.	"It isn't a whole lot of fun trying to figure out a way to beat them," Showalter said Thursday afternoon. "They're really good. I'm glad they're in the other league and I'm glad somebody else has to worry about them."	Showalter expressed respect for Nationals manager Dusty Baker, who has turned Washington into a perennial contender.	"I think a lot of Dusty. They've got the right man," Showalter said. "He's special, through the years. They've got a lot of pieces in place; a lot of things have to go right for the team that's playing them to beat them."	Now in his first season with the Nationals, catcher Matt Wieters has been a part of this rivalry for both teams. After spending eight years in Baltimore, he hit the winning single on Wednesday night for Washington.	He says the competition between the teams isn't only about proximity.	"It's a little bit because of location, but also because you see the talent on the other side," Wieters said. "Players have mutual respect for what kind of talent each team has."	There were fans wearing Nationals red in Baltimore, and plenty of orange jerseys in D.C.	"I would think geography adds a little bit to it in terms of fan perspective," Washington reliever Matt Grace said. "There's a little bit of a battle there in the general area."	For one night only, the duel resumes next month.	ROTATION STAYS SAME	The Nationals will skip Thursday starter A.J. Cole and keep the same pitching lineup they set in place for their next series against visiting Philadelphia: Tanner Roark, Gio Gonzalez, Max Scherzer.	The Orioles pushed back their starting rotation. Dylan Bundy, Thursday's scheduled starter, will go Friday at Kansas City followed by Chris Tillman and Kevin Gausman.	RESPECTING HISTORY	Baker wore the cap of the Baltimore Elite Giants during his pregame talk. After paying homage to a few of the Giants' former stars, Baker said he grabbed the cap "because it's raining."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: RH relievers Koda Glover (hip) and Shawn Kelley (back) could return from the DL this weekend, Baker said. The duo has accounted for half of Washington's 10 saves this season.	Orioles: C Welington Castillo (shoulder) will serve as DH for Double-A Bowie on Friday and Saturday and catch Sunday. If all goes well, he will activated from the DL on Tuesday.	---	More AP baseball: apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

TORONTO --  A big hit by Ryan Goins gave the Blue Jays back-to-back series wins for the first time this season.	Goins singled home the winning run in the ninth inning and Toronto rallied from a four-run deficit to beat the Cleveland Indians 8-7 on Wednesday night.	Jose Bautista hit a three-run home run and Ezequiel Carrera added a tying, two-run drive for the Blue Jays, who have won seven of 11.	"We've been knocking on the door a lot and now we're finally knocking that door down," Goins said. "We're going to put our heads down, get as many wins as we can and look up at the end."	The victory was Toronto's seventh come-from-behind win of the year.	"Things have kind of flipped in in the month of May," manager John Gibbons said. "We're starting to win some of those game we couldn't win earlier in the year."	Carrera hit a one-out single in the ninth off Cody Allen (0-1), and Justin Smoak and Steve Pearce walked with two outs. Goins lined Allen's first pitch into the right field corner for his third hit of the game.	"I thought he would try to get ahead of me," Goins said. "I was looking for a heater and got one over the plate."	Allen walked just one batter in 10 April outings but has walked six in four May appearances.	"The walks are killing me, the deep counts are killing me, and tonight it cost us a chance to win a ball game," Allen said.	Roberto Osuna (2-0) pitched a perfect ninth.	Jason Kipnis and Brandon Guyer each had three RBI for the Indians, who led 7-3 in the third. Kipnis was 0 for 9 in the series before his two-run, first-inning double off Francisco Liriano.	Bautista homered in the bottom half against Danny Salazar, who has allowed 11 earned runs in the first inning over seven starts.	Cleveland's first seven batters reached in the third as the Indians chased Liriano, who allowed a season-worst seven runs in two-plus innings and failed to finish four innings for the second straight start. Kipnis and Jose Ramirez had RBI singles, and Guyer greeted Dominic Leone with a three-run double.	Pearce hit a sacrifice fly in the bottom half and Goins chased Salazar with an RBI single. Salazar matched a season-worst by allowing five runs in 2 2/3 innings.	"I didn't want to get to the bullpen too quick but it looked like it wasn't going to get better," manager Terry Francona said.	Carrera tied the score 7-all in the fourth with a two-out homer off Dan Otero.	DOUBLE TROUBLE	Blue Jays pitchers have given up an AL-high 65 doubles this season.	LATE SHOW	Cleveland lost a game decided after the seventh inning for the first time this season. They're 6-1 in such games.	CHILD'S PLAY	Taz Tulowitzki, the 3-year-old son of Blue Jays shortstop Troy Tulowitzki, drew cheers and laughs in the clubhouse following the game as he showed off his ability to mimic the batting stances of different Blue Jays players.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: OF Abraham Almonte left with a sore right shoulder after flying out to end the top of the second. He was replaced by Michael Martinez. Francona said Almonte is day-to-day. ... C Yan Gomes (illness) was replaced by Roberto Perez in the bottom of the third. Francona said Gomes was suffering from "intestinal turmoil."	Blue Jays: DH Kendrys Morales, who left Tuesday's game with a sore left hamstring, was held out of the starting lineup. Morales had an MRI Wednesday and has been diagnosed with a Grade 1 strain. He is day to day. ... Tulowitzki (right hamstring) hopes to begin a rehab assignment at Class A Dunedin this weekend and could rejoin the Blue Jays when they begin a series at Atlanta next Wednesday.	UP NEXT	Indians: Cleveland is off Thursday before starting a three-game series against visiting Minnesota. RHP Josh Tomlin (2-3, 7.13) will have an extra day of rest before facing the Twins. Tomlin is 1-2 with a 9.95 ERA in three home starts.	Blue Jays: RHP Marco Estrada (1-2, 3.14) starts the opener of a four-game series against Seattle. Estrada matched a season worst by allowing five runs at Tampa Bay on May 6.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  The Tampa Bay Rays' 12-1 victory over the Kansas City Royals was marred by one ugly moment.	Chris Archer pitched eight shutout innings Wednesday night and Logan Morrison, Rickie Weeks Jr., and Colby Rasmus homered for the Rays.	With Tampa Bay leading 7-0 in the seventh inning, Archer hit Kansas City catcher Salvador Perez in the left elbow with a pitch, and Perez took issue with it.	Words were exchanged, providing the emotional highlight of a game that had very few of them, at least from the Royals' point of view.	Archer (3-1) won for the first time in five starts since April 14 to help the Rays break a three-game losing streak. He scattered five singles and walked none, and his control is one of the reasons Perez had a problem with the pitch that hit him.	"Yeah, of course he threw at me. He's going to throw at me because I had two hits against him," Perez said. "I think he was mad. I don't think that's the right way."	"Honestly there was nothing malicious there," Archer said. "I've had some great interactions with him the past. He's a good hitter; I'm trying to pitch inside. There was no malicious intent with 96 mph."	Asked if he understood Perez's angry reaction, Archer said: "No."	Morrison's ninth homer of the season, and his fourth in seven games, came off Kansas City starter Jason Hammel with a man on in the third inning. Weeks followed with his second home run, putting the Rays up 4-0.	Rasmus hit a grand slam off reliever Peter Moylan in the eighth, the sixth slam of his career.	Everyone in the Tampa Bay lineup had at least one hit for the second straight day. Corey Dickerson had a triple and a single and scored three runs.	Hammel (1-4) gave up six earned runs and 13 hits in seven innings, dropping to 0-6 in his last seven road starts.	The Rays scored their first run on a sacrifice fly double play. With Dickerson on third base, Evan Longoria on first and one out in the first inning, Morrison hit a short fly ball that was caught by Royals shortstop Alcides Escobar. Longoria was caught too far off base and doubled up, but not until after Dickerson had tagged up and scored.	Archer threw 101 pitches, marking his 17th straight start in which he threw at least 100 pitches. It was the 20th double-digit strikeout game of his career and his first win against the Royals.	"(The Royals) have given all of us fits and have given (Archer) fits, too," Rays manager Kevin Cash said. "I don't think he did anything differently tonight. He's in a good rhythm right now and it carries over game to game."	FIRST HIT, RBI FOR SOLER	Jorge Soler drove in Kansas City's only run with a ninth-inning double off reliever Jose Alvarado. It was the first hit as a Royal for Soler, who came in a Dec. 7 trade with the Chicago Cubs for reliever Wade Davis. Soler came off the DL on Saturday after having a strained left oblique. He is 1 for 16 in five games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals: RHP Ian Kennedy (hamstring) has resumed throwing off a mound. ... RHP Seth Maness, who underwent surgery on Aug. 18 to repair a torn UCL in his throwing elbow, had his contract purchased from Triple-A Omaha.	Rays: RF Steven Souza Jr. (sore thumb) was out of the lineup for the second consecutive game. ... SS Matt Duffy (Achilles' tendon surgery) had no soreness one day after his first rehab game with Class-A Charlotte. He had Wednesday off.	UP NEXT	Thursday's series finale features two of the hottest pitchers in the AL. Royals LHP Jason Vargas is 4-1 with a league-leading 1.19 ERA. Rays RHP Jake Odorizzi (2-1, 2.88) has given up only eight hits in his last four starts, one of which he left after one inning with a strained hamstring.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Delino DeShields took two hard steps toward home plate. He then got to jog in from third base with the tying run for the Texas Rangers after a balk.	Two innings later, DeShields scored on a wild pitch in the seventh that gave Texas a 4-3 victory over the San Diego Padres on Wednesday night.	In a game that the Rangers were 1 of 13 with runners in scoring position, they also scored on a wild pitch.	"It wasn't necessarily pretty offensively, but however you get an opportunity to capitalize on some situations, balls put in play," manager Jeff Banister said.	DeShields drew a one-out walk from reliever Brad Hand (0-2) in the seventh before Shin-Soo Choo also walked. Elvis Andrus then hit a potential double-play grounder, but second baseman Yangervis Solarte's wide throw to first went into the camera well.	"For me, it's a physical error. Physical errors happen," said Padres manager Andy Green, who lost a replay challenge that Choo obstructed on the play by not sliding while going into second base.	After Choo's RBI single in the fifth, Texas got even at 3 when DeShields scored on the balk by Padres starter Luis Perdomo, who shuffled his feet off the rubber when DeShields bluffed toward the plate.	"When he was in his windup, (third base coach Tony) Beasley basically told me that when he yelled `Go!' I was to give him two hard steps," DeShields said. "I guess he balked the same way in his last outing. ... We got the run and it was huge."	Jeremy Jeffress (1-2) allowed singles to the Nos. 8 and 9 hitters to start the top of the seventh after replacing Yu Darvish, but got out of the inning without allowing a run. Matt Bush worked the ninth for his second save.	Choo got Texas started with a leadoff single in the first, moved to third when Andrus executed a hit-and-run and scored on a wild pitch to make it 1-1.	All of San Diego's runs came off Darvish in the first two innings, when Wil Myers and Erick Aybar hit long homers before Matt Szczur's RBI double into the right-center gap for a 3-1 lead. Darvish struck out six with no walks in six innings.	"I feel like we kind of let him off the hook tonight, myself included, chasing some pitches," Myers said. "Especially with a guy like that, if you don't zone him up, he's going to take advantage of your aggressiveness."	RISP FOR YU	Szczur's infield single in the fourth ended Darvish's team record of opposing hitters going 0 for 36 against him with runners in scoring position. That span dated to last September, and broke Charlie Hough's mark set in 1989 with his streak of opponents going 0 for 35 with runners in scoring position.	SHORTER OUTING FOR YU	After Darvish went 125 and 113 pitches in his previous two pitches, he was pulled after 96 pitches this time. The Rangers had a full bullpen available after A.J. Griffin's four-hit shutout in San Diego on Tuesday. "We had this one tabbed as we're going to back off a little bit and not push him over that 100 mark," Banister said.	GETTING ON BASE	Choo has reached base seven consecutive plate appearances -- and 10 of 11. "I know I've had a really slow start," Choo said. "The last couple of games I'm kind of feeling back to normal. Seeing a lot of pitches, swinging at strikes."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: Reliever Jose Torres left the game after a comebacker MLB stats showed at 105 mph hit just above the wrist on his non-throwing arm in the eighth. Torres recovered to pick up the ball to throw out Rougned Odor out at first base. Green said Torres should be OK.	Rangers: RHP Tyson Ross (thoracic outlet syndrome) is scheduled for a three-inning simulated game Saturday at extended spring training in Arizona. The former Padre is still several weeks from his Rangers debut.	UP NEXT	Padres: Wanting a lefty against Texas and a righty against the Chicago White Sox on Friday, the Padres flipped their starter. Lefty Clayton Richard goes in the series finale against the Rangers, whose .192 batting average against lefties is 30 points lower than their average against right-handers. Righty Jhoulys Chacin had initially been set to start Thursday.	Rangers: Martin Perez (1-5) will try to avoid become the first six-game loser in the majors this season.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.

MILWAUKEE -- Keon Broxton and Eric Thames keep hitting for the Milwaukee Brewers, helping to power a productive offense that might need to withstand another injury to Ryan Braun.	On Wednesday night, the Brewers found some relief on the mound, too, to shut down the Boston Red Sox.	Top of the order hitters Broxton and Thames had two hits each and set the tone in a four-run fifth inning, while right-handers Rob Scahill and Jared Hughes provided key innings out of the bullpen to preserve a 7-4 victory over the Red Sox on Wednesday night.	After beating Boston 11-7 in the series opener on Tuesday, the Brewers took another interleague slugfest. The teams combined for 24 hits, 13 for Milwaukee. The Brewers also scored two runs on throwing errors by catcher Christian Vazquez, one each in the fifth and sixth.	"We just did a nice job keeping the pressure on them offensively and scored seven runs without a home run, so it was a good night for us offensively," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said.	Broxton started rallies in the fifth and sixth with hits. Second-place hitter Thames' ground-rule double drove home Broxton in the fifth to break a 2-2 tie.	Thames stole second in the sixth on a play that ended with Broxton scoring from third on one of Vazquez's errors to make it a five-run lead. Broxton and Thames also played key roles in the opener.	"It's beautiful and it's a lot of fun ... every guy in that lineup is going to give a tough at-bat, and come up with some good results," Broxton said.	Jackie Bradley Jr. homered for the Red Sox, while Vazquez was one of four Boston hitters with two hits.	Red Sox starter Kyle Kendrick (0-2) was shelled for six runs and 10 hits in 4 1/3 innings. Kendrick's spot in the rotation seems tenuous after his ERA ballooned to 12.96.	"We'll see what happens," Kendrick said when asked about his future. "You guys can ask (management) though. I'm sure they will tell you something."	Manager John Farrell said he might rearrange the rotation with a day off coming up Monday and his bullpen overworked of late.	WHAT A RELIEF	Brewers starter Chase Anderson needed 99 pitches to get through 4 2/3 innings, allowing nine hits and two runs.	When Boston's Mookie Betts hit an RBI single in the fourth to tie the game at 2, it seemed as if the teams were well on their way to another long night of lots of hits and mediocre pitching.	But Scahill (1-1) shut down the Red Sox, allowing just two walks over 2 1/3 scoreless innings to pick up the win. Hughes got Vazquez to ground into a 5-4-3 double play with the bases loaded and no outs in the eighth, holding Boston to one run in the inning.	"No bigger opportunity than the eighth inning, but we come up short with three double plays here tonight," Farrell said.	STARS OUT	Both squads lost key players to injuries. Boston first baseman Hanley Ramirez left before the bottom of the fourth with what the team called a muscle spasm in his right upper back. Braun departed after singling in the fifth with left calf tightness. Counsell said he was planning to give Braun a day off on Wednesday anyway.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: Ramirez, who made his first start at first base this season, had been limited to serving as a designated hitter this year and had a lingering right shoulder injury. ... LHP David Price (strained left elbow) is scheduled to make his first rehab start in the minors on Sunday at Triple-A Pawtucket.	Brewers: RHP Junior Guerra (right calf) will make his first rehab start on Monday at Double-A Biloxi, where he hopes to throw about 75 pitches. Guerra got hurt trying to run out a bunt at the plate during his first career opening day start.	UP NEXT	LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (1-1) has been respectable on the road to begin the season, going 1-1 with a 3.71 ERA in three starts. He'll make his first career start against the Brewers as the Red Sox wrap up a three-game interleague series at Miller Park. RHP Jimmy Nelson (1-2) goes for Milwaukee. He left after three innings in his last start on Friday against Pittsburgh because of a 2 1/2-hour rain delay.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

PHOENIX -- The Arizona Diamondbacks are looking for a fifth starting pitcher now that Shelby Miller's season is over due to elbow surgery. Right-hander Zack Godley might very well have earned another opportunity to show he can be that guy.	Godley allowed four hits in seven innings after being called up from Triple-A in time to make his second start of the season, and the Diamondbacks beat the Detroit Tigers 7-1 on Wednesday night to end a three-game losing streak.	Nick Ahmed, Yasmany Tomas and Brandon Drury homered for the Diamondbacks (19-16), who have 13 wins at home this season.	Godley (1-0) allowed a run and struck out six, though Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo was non-committal when asked about giving Godley another start in five days.	"He did a great job, I will say that," Lovullo said. "We will sit down and talk about that in the coming days and figure out the best situation for us moving forward."	Said Godley: "That's up to them to decide. All I can do is keep doing what they ask of me. If they ask me to start, I'll start. If they ask me to go out of the pen, I'll do that. If they want me to go back down, I'll do that, too. I'll just keep trying to take advantage of the opportunities they give me."	A.J. Pollock delivered a two-out, two-run single in the bottom of the sixth for Arizona.	Tigers starter Matthew Boyd (2-2) allowed three earned runs on eight hits in six innings. Boyd had six strikeouts and three walks, two intentional, and collected his first career hit, an infield single in the third.	Arizona led 2-1 before Drury doubled with one out in the sixth and Ahmed was intentionally walked with two outs. Boyd walked Godley, and paid for allowing the pitcher to reach when Pollock knocked in a pair with the bases full.	"I need better focus and I can't walk the pitcher. Got to make him put in play and what not. It cost us there," Boyd said. "Pollock shouldn't have come up to the plate, that's just the fact of the matter."	Anibal Sanchez relieved Boyd in the seventh and gave up back-to-back home runs to Tomas and Drury. Tomas hit his sixth of the season, a two-run shot, and Drury his second.	It marked the third time the Diamondbacks have hit back-to-back home runs this season.	STEALING STRATEGY	The Diamondbacks took over the major league lead in stolen bases Wednesday night with their 38th, courtesy of Goldschmidt in the seventh inning. Pollock leads the team with 11, and Lovullo was asked if Pollock has the green light to steal third base at any time. "I don't want to give our strategy away," Lovullo said, pausing for effect. "Yes, he does."	DIAMONDBAC-KS	Arizona tied the major league record (since 1913) with its ninth consecutive home game with 10 or more strikeouts, recording 10 after reliever Randall Delgado added four to Godley's six. That ties the 2017 Houston Astros' streak from April 20-May 9.	BELL TOLLS	Left-hander Chad Bell made his major league debut for the Tigers, entering the game to pitch the bottom of the eighth. He'd been called up from Triple-A Toledo on May 1.	Bell pitched a scoreless inning with his first strikeout.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: OF J.D. Martinez played all nine innings for Toledo Tuesday night as part of a rehab assignment, and played again Wednesday though he complained of soreness prior to the game. He is on the 10-day disabled list with a right mid-foot sprain. ... Manager Brad Ausmus said 2B Ian Kinsler will be able to play on Thursday after missing the past five games with left hamstring tightness. ... A trainer came out to check on Boyd after he was hit in the leg, but Boyd threw some warmup pitches and stayed in. Boyd had a large bruise on his lower leg after the game.	Diamondbacks: Pitcher Shelby Miller had right elbow reconstructive surgery on Wednesday in Los Angeles, and Lovullo said he will be out for 15 months. Lovullo expects Miller to return to the team in the coming days. ... LHP T.J. McFarland was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a left ankle contusion sustained when he was hit by a line drive in Tuesday's game.	UP NEXT	Tigers: Michael Fulmer (3-1) brings his 2.77 ERA into Friday's start against the Los Angeles Angels in the series opener in Anaheim.	Diamondbacks: RHP Zack Greinke (3-2) faces the Pittsburgh Pirates in the opener of a four-game series in Phoenix. He's 6-3 in his career against Pittsburgh.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

LOS ANGELES --  Kenta Maeda wished the longest outing of his major league career was just a little longer.	Maeda pitched into the ninth inning, Cody Bellinger homered and made a tumbling catch in left field and the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 5-2 on Wednesday night to complete a three-game sweep.	Maeda (3-2) got within two outs of his first career complete game. Francisco Cervelli hit a two-run homer in the ninth, though, and Maeda was pulled a batter later, going 8 1/3 innings while allowing two runs and five hits. He struck out five and left to a rousing ovation.	"Definitely. The home run in the ninth inning was a tough one to swallow," Maeda said.	His outing was splendid as the Dodgers won their fourth consecutive game.	"He was pounding the strike zone (and) using all quadrants," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. "I was hoping for him to complete it, but you get to a certain point where you want to make sure you win the game. I didn't want him to have a sour taste after that brilliant outing."	Bellinger hit a two-run homer in the first inning off Chad Kuhl (1-3), then got dirty to rob Gregory Polanco of a hit in the fourth. The rookie started in place of injured Andrew Toles, and fans in the left field pavilion chanted "Cody! Cody!" after the tumbling grab.	"I didn't know what to do," Bellinger said of hearing his name. "I just stood there and felt awkward. But it was cool."	Bellinger has six homers and a .315 batting average through his first 14 career games. He's been excellent filling in for injured Adrian Gonzalez at first base, and may now get regular time in left field after Toles was diagnosed Wednesday with a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee, which will require season-ending surgery.	Kuhl allowed four runs and six hits in five innings. He walked two and struck out four. He gave up three runs with two outs in the first inning, including that home run to Bellinger.	"It's a shame what happened in the first inning," Kuhl said. "It's just unacceptable."	The Pirates scored just six runs in the three games and couldn't figure out how to get to Maeda.	"He let us know right away what he was going to do," Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said. "We needed to hit the breaking ball and take that away from him, and we weren't able to do that. He just kept throwing it and he didn't throw a lot of fastballs."	Maeda allowed a leadoff single to Josh Harrison in the ninth, then Cervelli hit a first-pitch homer to left field. Maeda struck out Andrew McCutchen, and then his night was done. Grant Dayton got the final two outs.	HONORING A TEAMMATE	The Pirates wore purple wristbands on Wednesday for the first time honoring their pitcher, Jameson Taillon. The 25-year-old had surgery Monday for what is believed to be testicular cancer.	The inscription said: "JAMO (hash)50."	"I'm not sure how far-reaching it will end up being," Hurdle said. "I'm sure there will be a lot of people who ask about it. We received them (Wednesday).	"It's one way that we can let him know we're thinking about him all the time."	WHO IS ON FIRST?	With the Toles injury and Gonzalez still out, second baseman Chase Utley played first base.	"First base is interesting," Utley said. "You have to figure out balls to go after and balls to let go. I think the more you play over there, the more comfortable you get."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: Prospect Kevin Newman was hit in the head by a 94 mph pitch during Double-A Altoona's game in Richmond, Virginia. Newman walked off the field, and Curve manager Michael Ryan told MiLB.com that Newman does not have a concussion. Newman was Pittsburgh's first-round pick in the 2015 draft.	Dodgers: LHP Adam Liberatore (left groin strain) was placed on the 10-day disabled list along with Toles. The Dodgers activated OFs Scott Van Slyke and Brett Eibner. ... LHP Rich Hill (blister) pitched five shutout innings in a rehab start for Class A Rancho Cucamonga and did not allow a hit.	UP NEXT	Pirates: RHP Gerrit Cole (1-3, 3.14 ERA) faces Zack Greinke in Arizona on Thursday. In his last outing, he allowed just one run and two hits while striking out eight in seven innings. He didn't get the decision as the Pirates won in extra innings.	Dodgers: LHP Hyun-Jin Ryu (1-4, 4.05 ERA) will pitch Thursday for the first time since coming off the 10-day disabled list with a hip contusion. Ryu struck out nine in his last start, but his ERA and six home runs allowed in 26 2/3 innings is of concern, especially in Colorado.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

MILWAUKEE --  Mookie Betts got what he wanted.	Betts' three-run home run in the ninth inning Thursday lifted the Boston Red Sox to a 4-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. It was Betts' fifth homer of the season and third in his last four games, and helped Boston salvage one win in the three-game series in the Red Sox's first trip to Milwaukee since 2003.	Boston's right fielder enjoyed his time at Miller Park, as he went 7 for 11 with eight runs batted in and five runs scored.	"He's certainly impacting the baseball," Boston manager John Farrell said. "He's come up big in so many situations. But this was probably as big of a swing as he's had all year for us."	Milwaukee closer Neftali Feliz (0-4) came on in the ninth, but managed to get only one out. Red Sox pitcher Craig Kimbrel (2-0) got the final five outs as Boston snapped the Brewers' three-game winning streak.	Christian Vazquez led off the ninth with a walk. He was safe at second on a fielder's choice when Deven Marrero's bunt was fielded by Feliz, but his throw to second base was dropped by shortstop Orlando Arcia.	Betts followed with a deep shot to left to help Boston wrap up its six-game road trip with a 3-3 record.	"I was just trying to be ready for a fastball," Betts said. "He throws 100, so that's his best pitch. I was able to get a good one and put a good swing on it."	Boston quickly got on the board in the first inning. Betts led off with a double, took third on a sacrifice bunt by Dustin Pedroia and scored when Xander Bogaerts' ground ball rolled under the glove of first baseman Jesus Aguilar.	In the bottom of the inning, Boston starter Eduardo Rodriguez gave up a one-out double to Keon Broxton, but then retired the next 13 batters. In the sixth, he allowed a lead-off single to Manny Pina, who scored on a two-out double to left by Jonathan Villar.	Rodriguez, who struck out five and allowed three hits in six innings, has given up five earned runs in his last 29 1/3 innings.	His counterpart, Jimmy Nelson, struck out eight, allowed four hits and an unearned run in 6 2/3 innings.	"Both starters were excellent," Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said. "It felt like it was a game where runs were going to be pretty tough to come by."	OUCH!	Boston's Mitch Moreland hit a foul ball that knocked the face mask straight over the head of catcher Pina and sent him on his backside. A few innings later, Red Sox catcher Christian Vazquez's mask was jarred off on a ball hit by Villar.	NEW DAY JOB	Milwaukee's manager of media relations, Ken Spindler, was one of the ball boys. His one blemish came when he misplayed a throw from left fielder Andrew Benintendi as they warmed up between innings and had to chase after the ball along the foul line.	KENDRICK REPLACED	Before the game, Boston recalled LHP Robbie Ross Jr. from Triple-A Pawtucket after the team optioned RHP Kyle Kendrick there Wednesday night. Kendrick (0-2) was shelled for six runs and 10 hits in 4 1/3 innings on Wednesday, giving him an earned run average of 12.96 this season.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: Hanley Ramirez, who left the game Wednesday with a muscle spasm in his upper back, received treatment in the morning and did not play.	Brewers: Ryan Braun also sat out and is unlikely to play Friday because of a left calf strain.	UP NEXT	Red Sox: RHP Rick Porcello (2-4) faces Tampa Bay again after allowing eight earned runs in 4 1/3 innings against the Rays on April 14.	Brewers: RHP Matt Garza (1-0) makes his fourth start of the year as the New York Mets visit.	---	More AP baseball: apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	There are no items to show in this view of the "Sports Desk" discussion board.

It was 1-1 in the eighth when Boston had runners on second and third with no outs, and then the bases loaded with one out. But Corey Knebel struck out Jackie Bradley Jr., and Josh Rutledge to end the threat.	Boston quickly got on the board in the first inning.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Jason Vargas isn't setting a season-long goal of allowing an average of one run a start. Yet that's where he is at after seven outings.	The major league ERA leader went seven more scoreless innings, Salvador Perez had a two-run double during a five-run eighth inning, and the Kansas City Royals beat the Tampa Bay Rays 6-0 on Thursday.	Vargas (5-1) allowed three hits and dropped his ERA from 1.19 to 1.01.	"It hasn't been done very often in this sport," Vargas said. "It's a nice thing to see when you're able to have good starts and put your team in a good position to have success at the end of the game."	It's the lowest ERA in the majors (at least 30 innings pitched) at the end of play on May 11th since Colorado's Ubaldo Jimenez (0.93) in 2010. The last AL pitcher to be this low was the Royals' Zack Greinke (0.51) in 2009.	Jorge Bonifacio hit an RBI single off Diego Moreno in the decisive eighth inning before Whit Merrifield had a run-scoring single and then circled the bases when center fielder Kevin Kiermaier misplayed the hit for a three-base error.	Merrifield also homered for the Royals, who won three of four against the Rays. Kansas City had lost 13 of 16 entering the series.	Jake Odorizzi (2-2) gave up one run and four hits in six innings for the Rays. He had allowed three hits or fewer in each of his previous four starts.	Tampa Bay went 3-6 during a nine-game homestand against Miami, Toronto and the Royals. All three opponents are well under .500.	"We've got some guys that are having a rough time on offense, on defense, on the mound," Rays manager Kevin Cash said.	Merrifield put the Royals up 1-0 on a solo shot in the fourth.	Vargas made two nifty defensive plays during the fifth. He fielded Kiermaier's slow grounder down the first base line and tagged out the speedy outfielder, and also caught Derek Norris' liner.	Rays left fielder Corey Dickerson took a home run away from Eric Hosmer in the first by reaching over the short wall by the 315-foot mark near the line and catching the drive.	Kansas City center fielder Alex Gordon took an extra-base hit away from Tim Beckham with a diving catch in the sixth. Gordon made his 932nd outfield start, but first in center.	There was no carry over one day after Perez was hit by Chris Archer's pitch in the seventh inning of the Rays' 12-1 win Wednesday night. Perez felt Archer was throwing at him, while Archer said there was no intent.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals: CF Lorenzo Cain got a day off after playing three games on the artificial turf at Tropicana Field.	Rays: RF Steven Souza Jr. (sore right thumb) had a cortisone shot Wednesday and missed his third consecutive game.	GOLDEN STRUGGLES	Kiermaier, a Gold Glove winner, made three errors in the series, including one Monday night that allowed Cain to score after hitting a single.

NEW YORK --  In a game Houston ace Dallas Keuchel started, the best toss home definitely belonged to Jake Marisnick.	A defensive replacement in left field, Marisnick made a perfect throw to nail Jacoby Ellsbury at the plate for the final out and the Astros held off the New York Yankees 3-2 on Thursday night.	A matchup between teams with the best records in baseball came down to the final play, and the Astros were better -- barely.	"I kind of started celebrating a little early, and then I stopped and watched what was happening," Marisnick said.	Ellsbury's single with two outs in the ninth inning put runners at the corners, and the fleet leadoff hitter stole second. Gary Sanchez followed by grounding a sharp RBI single and Marisnick fired a strike on the fly to catcher Brian McCann to get the sliding Ellsbury.	"You have to take that shot," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "That's the right call."	McCann pumped his fist after making the tag and Marisnick whooped it up with fellow outfielders George Springer and Josh Reddick. Marisnick came into the game in the seventh, taking over for Norichika Aoki.	"Right on the money," McCann said. "I mean, couldn't ask for a better throw. Right on the money.	"Jake puts a lot of pride in his defense, in his game, and he works on that all the time. You see him out there working on the days he doesn't play," he said.	Keuchel (6-0) became the first six-game winner in the majors, helped by a home run from Carlos Correa. The Astros won their fourth in a row and improved to 24-11 -- their top mark after 35 games since the franchise began playing in 1962.	Ken Giles wound up with his 10th save in 11 tries, saved by Marisnick.	Marisnick tapped his glove a couple times as he charged, took an extra step to steady himself and let loose.	"I think the biggest thing there is not to rush it," Marisnick said. "Just kind of take your time with it and slow things down."	Carlos Beltran and McCann were quiet at the plate in their return to Yankee Stadium, the former New York power hitters going hitless in seven at-bats for Houston.	Michael Pineda (3-2) pitched into the seventh. He fell behind in the first when Correa lined a two-run drive over the wall in right-center, making the Astros star 6 for 9 with three homers against the right-hander.	Correa later singled and walked. After a slow start this season, he's hitting .353 with four homers, 10 doubles and 17 RBI in his last 17 games.	Keuchel kept up his resurgence, striking out nine in six innings. He earned the AL Cy Young Award in 2015, but dipped to 9-12 last season. Overall, he's won eight straight dating to last August, matching a career high.	Keuchel once again throttled the Yankees, improving to 5-2 with a 1.24 ERA against them. Those totals include a win at Yankee Stadium in the 2015 AL wild-card game.	The 29-year-old lefty permitted just one run, and it was unearned. First baseman Yuli Gurriel dropped an easy toss for an error in the fifth and trailing 3-0, the Yankees loaded the bases with one out.	After Chris Carter struck out, Ellsbury reached base on catcher's interference, tipping McCann's glove. Ellsbury has a knack for this -- he's done it 28 times in his career, one behind the mark set by Pete Rose. Ellsbury set a record by doing it 12 times last season.	"It's my fault. I played with him last year, and he had a ton of them. Bad on my part not scooting back," McCann said.	But the next time Ellsbury hit McCann's mitt, he wasn't so fortunate.	"It's a bang-bang play, and you tip your hat to Jake. He made an amazing throw to win the game for us," McCann said.	WELCOME BACK	Beltran and McCann both spent plenty of time exchanging hugs and handshakes with their former teammates during batting practice. Girardi spotted McCann behind the cage, noticed his facial hair -- a no-no in New York -- and greeted him with "What about that beard!"	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: 1B Greg Bird (bruised ankle) was checked by a doctor and isn't ready to begin baseball activities. He's been on the DL since May 2.	UP NEXT	Astros: RHP Lance McCullers (2-1, 3.40 ERA) has struck out 50 in 42 1/3 innings this year. His dad, Lance, pitched for the Yankees in 1989-90.	Yankees: Rookie LHP Jordan Montgomery (2-1, 3.81) worked into the seventh inning to win at Wrigley Field last weekend.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

TORONTO --  Marco Estrada rebounded nicely from a rough first inning against the red-hot Seattle Mariners.	Steve Pearce hit a three-run home run, Justin Smoak had a solo homer and finished with four RBI, and the Toronto Blue Jays beat the Mariners 7-2 on Thursday night, snapping Seattle's win streak at four games.	After giving up two runs in the first, Estrada (2-2) held Seattle scoreless for the next five innings, helping Toronto win for the fourth time in five games.	"He shut us down tonight," Mariners manager Scott Servais said.	Smoak went 3 for 3 with a walk against his former team. He had an RBI single in the first, walked in the fourth, singled home two runs in the fifth, and connected off rookie Sam Gaviglio in the seventh.	"He's a little more aggressive early in the count, and he's laying off that breaking ball," manager John Gibbons said.	Mariners slugger Nelson Cruz hit a two-run homer but Seattle's offense came up empty after the first.	After scoring 21 runs in their previous two games, the Mariners jumped on Estrada in the opening frame. Jean Segura led off with a double and Cruz drilled a one-out homer into the center field party deck, his eighth.	"That first inning was kind of tough," Estrada said. "Even the outs were kind of hit pretty hard. I'm glad I was able to turn things around and make better pitches after that."	Smoak halved the deficit with an RBI single off Chase De Jong in the bottom half.	Toronto took the lead by scoring five times in a two-out rally in the fifth. Smoak lined a bases-loaded single over the head of shortstop Segura, who had shifted out behind second base, and Pearce followed with his fourth home run.	"It kind of got away from us pretty quickly there," De Jong said.	Aaron Loup, Jason Grilli and Leonel Campos each worked one inning of relief for the Blue Jays.	De Jong (0-3) allowed six runs in five innings.	"I really wasn't as crisp as I'd like to have been," De Jong said.	Seattle dropped one game below .500. The Mariners have not had a winning record at any point this season.	BORDER BLUES	Mariners OF Guillermo Heredia and LHP Ariel Miranda did not travel with the team on its flight from Philadelphia to Toronto on Wednesday night because of visa issues. The players, both from Cuba, arrived in Toronto during the game Thursday.	FINALLY MADE IT	De Jong was excited to face Toronto, the team that drafted him out of high school in 2012, and the team his cousin Jordan pitched for in 2007. "Ever since I started my baseball career, I thought I was going to get up here," De Jong said. Toronto traded De Jong to the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2015.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: 2B Robinson Cano (right quadriceps) was scratched from the starting lineup. Cano left Tuesday's win at Philadelphia after four innings with the same injury. ... LHP James Paxton (left forearm) played catch at 60 feet at Safeco Field on Thursday and will be reevaluated Friday. ... Seattle claimed RHP Casey Lawrence on waivers from Toronto, recalled LHP Zac Curtis from Double-A Arkansas and optioned RHP Dan Altavilla to Triple-A Tacoma. To make room for Lawrence, RHP Evan Scribner was moved from the 10-day DL to the 60-day DL.	Blue Jays: LHP Francisco Liriano (sore shoulder) was placed on the 10-day DL. Toronto recalled Campos from Triple-A Buffalo. ... Kendrys Morales (left hamstring) missed his second straight game. Gibbons said Morales might be available to pinch hit Friday.	UP NEXT	Mariners: RHP Christian Bergman (0-0, 2.45 ERA) will make his first start of the season. He allowed one run in 3 2/3 innings in a May 7 relief appearance against Texas. Bergman made 15 major league starts with Colorado over the previous three seasons.	Blue Jays: RHP Joe Biagini (0-1, 2.78) makes his second start since joining Toronto's injury-riddled rotation. Biagini pitched four shutout innings at Tampa Bay last Sunday.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Party at Napoli's -- Texas Rangers style.	Mike Napoli homered twice, including a game-ending three-run shot , as the Rangers rallied late for a 5-2 victory over the San Diego Padres on Thursday night.	"A lot of fun," Napoli said. "The at-bat before felt pretty good. It was a feeling I've been looking for for a long time. And in that last at-bat, I was just trying to repeat it."	The Rangers had been held scoreless by San Diego lefty starter Clayton Richard until Napoli hit a 433-foot homer to left on the first pitch of the eighth inning, a hanging slider.	"Literally one mistake all day, to Napoli," Padres manager Andy Green said.	Napoli topped that with a 448-foot shot, his seventh of the season, into the club-level seats higher in left field to end a four-run ninth off Padres closer Brandon Maurer (0-2).	"That's what we know he's capable of," said shortstop Elvis Andrus, who scored the tying run before Napoli's blast. "Sometimes you just need a couple of good games like that. The trust is coming back. The swing is coming back."	"Party at Napoli's" became a team rallying cry for the AL champion Cleveland Indians last season, when Napoli hit a career-high 34 homers. After Cleveland didn't re-sign him, Napoli is hitting just .172 so far in his third stint in Texas.	His 15th career multihomer game came on the same day the Rangers started selling "Party at Napoli's" T-shirts at the ballpark for $32 a pop, with some of the proceeds going to charity. More than 300 of the shirts were sold and the team was already ordering more.	MLB stats measured the exit velocity of the game-winner at 111 mph. It was the fourth time in Napoli's career to end a game with a homer.	Andrus started the ninth-inning rally with a one-out single before Jonathan Lucroy followed with his third hit, looping a single that dropped just in front of diving center fielder Manual Margot. Rougned Odor then singled through the left side of the infield to drive home Andrus with the tying run and bring Napoli to the plate.	Sam Dyson (1-4), the demoted Rangers closer, worked around two hits in a scoreless ninth.	Martin Perez scattered seven hits over 6 1/3 innings with three strikeouts and two walks, one of those intentional. The Rangers lefty avoided becoming the majors' first six-game loser when his team rallied late.	Richard struck out four with one walk while allowing five hits pitching into the eighth.	COULD HAVE BEEN MORE	After Tony Barnette relieved Perez with the bases loaded in the seventh, Margot hit a deep sacrifice fly for a 2-0 Padres lead. Speedy left fielder Delino DeShields went a long way to make a running catch in the gap near the warning track, a catch that prevented more runs from scoring.	SPIKED AT THIRD	Austin Hedges had his right hand stepped on while sliding into third base in the seventh before scoring on Margot's sac fly. Pete Kozma made a diving backhanded stop well behind third base when Luis Sardinas hit a chopper down the line. Kozma quickly shuffled to his feet hoping to get a forceout, but instead stepped on Hedges' hand that was already on the bag. "Got spiked, a little bit of blood, but he's fine," Green said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: Lefty reliever Jose Torres was available to pitch a night after a comebacker measured at 105 mph struck him flush just above his right wrist. "His throwing hand is fine," Green said. "If it had caught off the bone, he wouldn't have had a chance."	Rangers: 3B Adrian Beltre, who hasn't played yet this season because of calf issues, took batting practice on the field for the first time since he re-aggravated the muscle three weeks ago. Beltre also took some groundballs, but still hasn't run at full speed.	UP NEXT	Padres: Jhoulys Chacin (3-3), in his 10th major league season, makes his first career appearance against the Chicago White Sox. That will leave only two MLB teams he has never faced: Colorado and Toronto.	Rangers: Andrew Cashner looks for his first win with the Rangers in the opener of a weekend series at home against the Oakland Athletics. Cashner (0-3) has a 2.63 ERA in his five starts, but has gotten no run support (1.65 runs per start).	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

CHICAGO --  Eduardo Escobar helped power Minnesota to a quick, commanding lead. Then it turned out the Twins needed every run -- and some pretty nifty bullpen work.	Escobar hit a three-run homer in the first then added a fourth RBI with a double as Minnesota outlasted the struggling Chicago White Sox 7-6 on Thursday night.	Brian Dozier and Miguel Sano crushed solo shots and Joe Mauer singled in a run for Minnesota, which hung on to deal the White Sox a season-high fifth straight loss after jumping out to a 6-0 advantage in the second inning.	"It was a good win because we had to fight all the way," said manager Paul Molitor, "and the bullpen did a pretty good job."	It looked like Minnesota might cruise to a victory in this one with resurgent starter Phil Hughes in charge and dealing early.  The right-hander didn't give up a hit until Avisail Garcia doubled with one out in the fourth when the Twins scored twice.	But Chicago closed to 7-6, led by Melky Cabrera's three-run homer off Hughes in the fifth. Chicago's Matt Davidson drove in two runs, on a solo homer and a groundout.	Ryan Pressly (1-2), the third of five Twins relievers, pitched a scoreless seventh inning for the win.	Brandon Kintzler got the final five outs for his eighth save in nine chances. He struck out Omar Narvaez and Leury Garcia in the eighth with the tying run on third and go-ahead run on second.	"That was a big set up inning for us (by Pressly)," Molitor said. "And that's a big-league save."	Hughes fell short of a chance to earn his fifth win when he was replaced by Tyler Duffey with two outs in the fifth after allowing five runs and six hits.	"When you've got a big lead early and kind of flounder in the middle innings it's inexcusable," Hughes said. "You just can't let the wheels come off like that."	Chicago starter Derek Holland (3-3) permitted seven runs, but just three earned, and six hits in five innings in taking the loss. Four White Sox relievers followed with four hitless innings.	"It wasn't as deflating as it might have seemed because we kept fighting," White Sox manager Rick Renteria said.	Ditto from Holland, who, settled in after being hit hard in the first two innings.	"The offense came up big," Holland said. "We just obviously didn't get what we wanted in the final result, but that shows a lot heart from this team and what we're capable of."	WILK'S HAPPY LANDING	LHP Adam Wilk joined the Twins before Thursday night's game after being claimed off waivers from the New York Mets on Wednesday. The 29-year-old had been designated for assignment by New York after being recalled from Triple-A Las Vegas then getting hit hard in an emergency start for suspended Matt Harvey on Sunday.	"Getting DFA'd over in New York, obviously you want to be claimed by somebody," Wilk said. "I was pretty happy."	Wilk, who underwent season-ending hip surgery in 2016, will join the Twins bullpen. Minnesota is the journeyman's sixth major league organization.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Twins: Dozier was back in the leadoff spot after missing three games with a sprained left ankle, suffered in a 4-3 win against Boston last Friday. "The ankle still doesn't look great, as far aesthetics, but that's how sprained ankles work," manager Paul Molitor said. "I don't' think we have much concern."	White Sox: RHP Zach Putnam (right elbow inflammation) threw from 45 and 60 feet on Thursday after seeing a doctor on Wednesday and having an MRI. "I'm trying to do everything I can to speed the process up," Putnam said. "Today I felt good." . 3B Todd Frazier was at DH on Thursday. Manager Rick Renteria said he's trying to keep the slugger's "back in check."	UP NEXT:	Twins: RHP Ervin Santana (5-1, 1.72 ERA) tries to rebound from his first loss this season when he faces Indians RHP Josh Tomlin (2-3, 7.12) in the opener of a three-game series at Cleveland on Friday night. Santana allowed a season-high six runs in six innings to Boston last Sunday.	White Sox: RHP Miguel Gonzalez (3-2, 3.18) tries to get back on track on Friday against San Diego RHP Jhoulys Chacin (3-3, 5.26) in the opener of a three-game set in Chicago. Gonzalez has lost his last two starts after beginning the season 3-0.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

DENVER -- The way Jeff Hoffman pitched early and how the Colorado offense built a 10-run lead, it looked like a sure night off for closer extraordinaire Greg Holland.	Not quite. Holland was needed to extinguish a late rally.	"You know what that is? That's baseball," Rockies manager Bud Black said. "I've seen it happen before."	Hoffman struck out eight and then anxiously waited to earn his first major league win, Carlos Gonzalez showed signs of breaking out of a slump with a two-hit, three-RBI night and the Rockies held off the Los Angeles Dodgers 10-7 on Thursday.	Next up for Hoffman, locating the game ball. He was sure someone grabbed it for him.	"Probably get (the ball) framed and put it somewhere," Hoffman said. "Hopefully, I'll have a house someday."	Ian Desmond and Nolan Arenado each added two doubles to help the Rockies extend their lead in the NL West to 2 1/2 games over the Dodgers. At 23-13, the Rockies are off to the best start in team history.	Hoffman (1-0) allowed three runs over 5 1/3 efficient innings after being recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque earlier in the day. He becomes the latest rookie to shine this season on the mound for Colorado.	On Wednesday, German Marquez allowed three hits over eight innings in a win over the Chicago Cubs, while Kyle Freeland and Antonio Senzatela threw in Tuesday's doubleheader. This marked the first time Colorado has started four straight rookie pitchers since 2002, according to Elias Sports Bureau.	"When you see them have success and how they're executing their game plan, it gives you a nice peace of mind," Hoffman said. "It's like, `All right, I can do that, too."	Dodgers lefty Hyun-Jin Ryu (1-5) surrendered 10 runs, five earned, and walked six over four innings. He was reinstated from the disabled list before the game after recovering from a bruised hip.	Colorado built a 10-0 lead through four innings only to have the Dodgers chip away. Brett Eibner's run-scoring single in the ninth off Scott Oberg made it 10-6 and led to the Rockies calling in Holland.	Holland eventually struck out Yasiel Puig on a slider in the dirt to end the game for his 15th save in as many chances.	"It is Coors Field and anything can happen," said Cody Bellinger, whose team had their five-game winning streak halted. "And even though we were down 10-0 we were like listen you know where we're playing. So we never gave up and we made it close."	Gonzalez was dropped to the sixth spot in the batting order with his average hovering under .200. The Dodgers even intentionally walked Desmond in the second to face Gonzalez, who lined a double to right as part of a five-run inning that was aided by a Dodgers throwing error.	The slumping Gonzalez retreated to the batting cage after going 0 for 4 on Wednesday, believing he had uncovered a tiny glitch in his swing.	Something was detected. Gonzalez finished with two hits for just the fourth time this season.	"The one number that matters is that we're winning ball games," Gonzalez said. "Nobody can change that."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: RHP Kenta Maeda was placed on the DL with tightness in his left hamstring.	Rockies: C Tony Wolters (concussion) keeps progressing, running the bases and blocking pitches in the dirt Thursday. ... Hoffman stepped in for lefty Tyler Anderson, whose start was pushed back to Saturday due to inflammation in his left knee. ... SS Trevor Story was placed on the 10-day DL with a strained left shoulder.	PASSED THE TEST	Fresh off taking two of three from the World Series champion Cubs, the Rockies face another test in a four-game series against Los Angeles.	"We don't need any more tests," Arenado said. "We're a good team, no matter what."	THIS & THAT	Jim Montgomery, the coach of the national champion University of Denver hockey team, threw out the first pitch. ... Dodgers pinch-hitter Scott Van Slyke hit a solo homer in the fifth off Hoffman. ... Crew chief Bill Miller called for the Dodgers translator to discuss something with Ryu in the fourth. Soon after, Ryu was called for a balk.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: LHP Clayton Kershaw (5-2, 2.40 ERA) is 19-6 with a 3.15 ERA in 34 career starts against Colorado.

PHOENIX --  So many great outings for Zack Greinke yet he never has thrown a no-hitter.	The 33-year-old right-hander came tantalizingly close in Arizona's 2-1 victory over Pittsburgh Thursday night.	Gregory Polanco ruined the bid with a leadoff home run in the eighth inning.	"Pretty impressive night for Zack," Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said, "flirts with a no-hitter. We're all engaged in the dugout. We're as excited as anybody in in the stadium. Unfortunately he might have made one mistake."	Greinke (4-2), who dominated the Pirates with a vicious slider, allowed that one hit in eight innings. He struck out 11 and walked one.	"The slider was pretty good," he said. "Most pitches were pretty good."	Greinke's ERA dropped to 2.79. He's had only one truly bad outing in his eight starts.	"His slider's been very good with late action in the hitting zone," Lovullo said. "He's been typical Zack for the last several outings. We're pleased that he's been as locked in as he has been. He's been carrying the staff and we want that to continue. It was a great outing for him all-around."	But Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said he's seen Greinke throw better.	"I have seen fastballs (with) more velocity, more life," Hurdle said. "He pitched tonight. He made pitches, he kept away from the middle of the plate, controlled bat speed. I have seen him a number of different ways, a number of different uniforms, but I can't say this is the best I have ever seen him pitch."	Fernando Rodney pitched a scoreless ninth for his ninth save in 11 tries. The game ended when Jeff Mathis threw out Josh Harrison from his knees trying to steal second.	Greinke faced the minimum 21 batters through seven innings. Jordy Mercer led off the third with a walk but was thrown out by Mathis trying to steal second.	Greinke said he began thinking about the no-hitter about the sixth inning.	"I got a one-hitter one time," he said, "but they got the hit the first or second inning so it wasn't very exciting."	Greinke said he "made a decent pitch" to Polanco.	But it was "too many inside pitches," he said. "He was obviously on the inner part of the plate that last at bat."	Gerrit Cole (1-4) allowed two runs and seven hits in seven innings. He struck out five and walked one. Pittsburgh has scored five runs total in Cole's last five starts.	The Pirates, swept by the Dodgers in Los Angeles over the weekend, lost their fifth straight and ninth in 12 games.	Arizona's David Peralta doubled twice and made a diving grab in right field to rob Andrew McCutchen in the first inning.	Jake Lamb doubled in a run and Brandon Drury had an RBI single for the Diamondbacks.	Greinke had nine strikeouts in the first five innings, most of them on sliders. McCutchen's' first-inning liner was the only ball to reach the outfield for the Pirates until the seventh inning.	Polanco hit Greinke's 2-2 pitch into the right field seats for his first home run of the season. Earlier in the at-bat, Polanco narrowly missed a homer with a towering foul ball to right.	"I said `Wow, unbelievable," Polanco said of the long foul. "I said, `I have to keep fighting. The at-bat is not over. I found my pitch and hit it."	NO-HIT HISTORY	Greinke has thrown one one-hitter, for Kansas City at Seattle on Aug. 30, 2009.	He was trying to become the third Arizona pitcher to throw a no-hitter. Randy Johnson threw a perfect game at Atlanta on May 18, 2004, and Edwin Jackson had a no-hitter at Tampa Bay on June 25, 2010.	The only no-hitter thrown at Arizona's Chase Field was by Jose Jimenez of St. Louis on June 25, 1999.	TRAINING ROOM	Pirates: Utility player Adam Frazier, on the DL since April 24 with a left hamstring strain, began a rehab assignment this week with Triple-A Indianapolis. He started at second base on Monday night, going 1 for 3 with a double, walk and RBI. He played left field Wednesday night, going 2 for 3 with a walk.	Diamondbacks: RHP Shelby Miller underwent Tommy John surgery Wednesday in Los Angeles. The operation was performed by Dr. Neal ElAttrache, the team doctor for the Dodgers.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: LHP Patrick Corbin  (2-4, 3.89 ERA), coming off a rough outing in Colorado, gets the start for Arizona and RHP Tyler Glasnow (1-2, 6.33) goes for the Pirates in the second game of the series Friday night.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  The Detroit Tigers have been mostly miserable at Angel Stadium over the past several years, losing seven consecutive series and struggling for even the smallest wins.	Giving a five-run lead to Michael Fulmer before he takes the mound in the second inning is a pretty good way to fix those woes.	Justin Upton hit a three-run homer and Fulmer pitched seven innings of three-hit ball in the Tigers' 7-1 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Thursday night.	Andrew Romine hit a two-run homer as the Tigers got a rare win over the Angels in the opener of a four-game series at the Big A, where Detroit hasn't won a series since August 2009. The Tigers also improved to 7-23 against Los Angeles since September 2012.	"That's one game, and we're not concerned about last year," Detroit manager Brad Ausmus said.	Still, the Tigers put together a comprehensive effort to improve to 3-3 on their nine-game West Coast road trip. Upton connected with two outs in the first inning for his seventh homer of the season, and the Tigers were never threatened.	Fulmer (4-1) was largely outstanding, walking two and striking out seven to improve to 3-0 in his last four starts.	"My goal is to get deep into games and throw strikes and not give up quality contact," Fulmer said.	Yunel Escobar had an RBI double for the Angels, who opened a seven-game homestand with their seventh loss in nine games.	TROUTBACK	Mike Trout went 0 for 4 as the Angels' designated hitter after missing five straight games and six of the previous seven with a tight left hamstring -- the most significant injury to date in his spectacular big-league career.	"It wasn't fun," Trout said of sitting out. "You want to be out there. ... I missed some pitches tonight, fouled off some I should hit, but that's baseball."	The two-time AL MVP hadn't played since last Friday, and his 17-game hitting streak ended. But he also felt strong on his legs while sprinting to run out two early ground balls, raising his confidence in his ability to return to center field Friday.	"Felt good," Trout said. "(The ground balls) clear your mind a little bit. Haven't done anything that speed in six days, but it felt fine."	RAMIREZ'S SLOW START	J.C. Ramirez (3-3) settled down to yield eight hits over seven innings, but couldn't overcome early mistakes that allowed Detroit to lead 5-0 after its first eight batters. Ramirez retired 10 straight Tigers and allowed just one runner past first base in his final five innings.	"It really came down to a couple of early pitches," Los Angeles manager Mike Scioscia said. "Outside of that, he settled in and threw the ball the way we expected. Once Fulmer got a lead, he's got strong stuff, and he pitched a good game for them."	ADDUCI INJURED	Romine was a late addition to the Tigers' lineup when Jim Adduci was scratched with a right oblique muscle injury, and he promptly hit his second homer of the season in the second inning. Ausmus said Adduci is probably headed to the disabled list, and injured outfielder J.D. Martinez is expected to join the Tigers in Anaheim on Friday. Martinez hasn't played yet this season after spraining his foot in spring training.	SLUMPING	The Angels benched 2B Danny Espinosa, who is mired in an 0-for-34 slump. Cliff Pennington started in Espinosa's place for the fifth time in nine games.	"We've got a handful of guys in our lineup that are struggling for rhythm," Scioscia said. "We know we'll be better."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: 2B Ian Kinsler returned to the leadoff spot after missing five games with left hamstring tightness. He went 3 for 4 and scored two runs.	Angels: With Trout as the DH, Albert Pujols played first base. The slugger was charged with an error in the second inning when he couldn't snag a high throw from Andrelton Simmons.	UP NEXT	Tigers: Jordan Zimmermann (3-1, 6.21 ERA) is getting results despite allowing 23 runs in 33 1/3 innings. He has made just one career start against the Angels, losing a four-hitter on an unearned run in Anaheim in June 2011.	Angels: Matt Shoemaker (1-2, 5.21 ERA) has a 1.01 career ERA against Detroit, but the Wyandotte, Michigan, native lost to the Tigers for the first time in his career last June in Anaheim.	---	More AP baseball: www.apnews.com/tags/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

SAN FRANCISCO --  The way the Cincinnati Reds are going, comeback wins are no longer surprising. They're becoming the norm.	"I think when you're playing really well over an extended period of time you anticipate ways of coming back," Reds manager Bryan Price said. "Somebody's going to get the big hit, somebody's going to hit one out, somebody's going to come in and make a great defensive play or shut down a rally."	Zack Cozart had two extra-base hits, including an RBI double in the top of the eighth inning that scored the game-winner, as the Cincinnati Reds defeated the San Francisco Giants 3-2 on Thursday night.	The Reds won for the ninth time in 11 games and have won 15 of their last 20 games at AT&T Park going back to the 2012 NLDS.	"I know we're feeling good now," Price said. "It's a long season, we'll like most teams continue to have some ups and downs, but right now you want to ride this as long as you can. It's a nice place to be."	The Giants, meanwhile, are in the dumps.	The Giants lost despite a four-hit game from center fielder Denard Span in his first game since coming off the disabled list. The Giants, who have an MLB-worst 12-24 record, lost for the sixth time in seven games and for the 10th time in their last 12.	Cozart doubled to left center off Giants reliever Hunter Strickland (0-1) scoring Scooter Gennett, who tripled to right leading off the eighth inning.	"I feel like the team in general, we're coming through in situations like that," Cozart said. "Everyone's happy for each other no matter who comes through, you're winning in a different fashion night in and night out.	"It's been fun."	Wandy Peralta (2-0) pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings and Reds closer Raisel Iglesias survived a white-knuckle ninth inning for his seventh save.	Reds starter Bronson Arroyo allowed two runs, six hits and one walk in six innings.	"It was the first time that I wanted to get back out after six innings, so I'm getting stronger," Arroyo said. "I'm just glad we pulled out the victory and the bullpen's been throwing fantastic."	Span went 4 for 5 with a home run and two doubles.	The Giants scored their only runs off Arroyo on home runs from Belt and Span.	Belt was hitless in 18 previous at-bats when he hit his fifth homer on the year, a shot to center off on an 84 mph cut fastball Arroyo left over the heart of the plate.	Span homered to right in the fifth to snap a 1-1 tie.	BLACH OUT	Giants starter Ty Blach remains winless in four starts after allowing two runs, five hits and one walk in seven innings. Blach had the worst outing of his career against the Reds on May 6, giving up 10 runs in three innings.	"We had such great effort from Ty," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "He did a great job bouncing back from that last outing against these guys who beat him up pretty good. I was proud of him. It's a shame we couldn't give him a win with that job he did."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: Recalled RHP Lisalverto Bonilla from Triple-A Louisville to take RHP Rookie Davis' spot in the rotation. Davis was sent to Louisville to work on his mechanics. Bonilla will start Saturday's game against the Giants.	Giants: Crawford (right groin strain) and Span (shoulder joint sprain) were activated from the DL. . The Giants optioned RHP Reyes Moronta back to Double-A Richmond and placed IF Conor Gillaspie on the 10-day DL with back spasms.	UP NEXT	RHP Johnny Cueto (4-2, 4.50 ERA) is 0-1 with a 6.00 ERA for the Reds in two starts against his former team. He will be opposed by RHP Scott Feldman (2-3, 3.76) in a rematch of Sunday's game in which he outdueled the two-time All-Star, tossing a four-hitter in a 4-0 Reds victory.	---	https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

NEW YORK --  The Houston Astros game at the New York Yankees on Saturday has been postponed because of inclement weather.	The teams will play a doubleheader on Sunday, when the Yankees will honor Derek Jeter before the second game. The rescheduled game will begin at 2:05 p.m. ET. The second game will start at 7:35 p.m.	Only tickets for Sunday will be valid for the doubleheader.	The Yankees will retire Jeter's No. 2 uniform in a ceremony scheduled for 6:35 p.m. They'll also unveil a plaque of the shortstop in Monument Park.	A 14-time All-Star, Jeter played his entire 20-year career with the Yankees and was a key contributor to five World Series championships.	Drafted sixth overall by New York in 1992, Jeter retired after the 2014 season at age 40 with a .310 career batting average over 2,747 regular season games.	He batted .308 with 111 runs scored in 158 postseason games, earning World Series MVP honors in 2000 against the crosstown rival New York Mets.	"I think any time Derek comes back it's special, but this will be even more meaningful," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "I think we've all been looking forward to it and I'm sure he's looking forward to it."	Jeter ranks at the top of the Yankees' all-time list in hits, singles, doubles, stolen bases, hit-by-pitches, at-bats and games played. His 3,465 career hits rank sixth in major league history, including eight seasons with at least 200.	"I have a lot of admiration and respect for how he went about his business," said Astros manager A.J. Hinch. "He might have been the most consistent presence in our game."	He's the first Yankees' player to have his number retired since teammates Andy Pettitte, Jorge Posada and Bernie Williams were honored in 2015.	"I will have our guys out here, to clap for him and be a part of it," Hinch said. "We've got a couple guys that played with him.	"Those of us that have been in the game a long time will want to, and the young guys will be wowed by the show that comes with retiring a number, especially here."	The AL West-leading Astros have the best record in baseball at 25-11. They've won five straight, including the first two of the four-game set. It's Houston's best 36-game start in franchise history.	The Yankees have lost three straight, but remain a half game behind first-place Baltimore in the AL East.	----	Baseball Writer Mike Fitzpatrick contributed to this report.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

TORONTO --  When opposing batters reach second base against Joe Biagini, Devon Travis likes to ask for their impressions of his Blue Jays teammate.	He's been hearing the same answer a lot lately.	Biagini and four relievers combined on a seven-hitter, Jose Bautista hit a two-run homer and Toronto beat the Seattle Mariners 4-0 on Friday night.	"That guy is nasty, man," Travis said of Biagini. "Every single guy that gets on (second) base, I ask them what they think about him and they've all got the same answer: he's something."	Travis had two RBI despite a hitless night for the Blue Jays, who have won five of six.	Biagini (1-1) gave up four hits, walked none and struck out three, winning as a starter for the first time in his second career start.	"They've got a good lineup over there," manager John Gibbons said. "He shut them down."	Biagni said he's been working on improving his changeup, and catcher Luke Maile suggested using it against Seattle.	"I try to make sure my arm speed is up on that pitch," Biagini said. "When it is, it looks a little bit more like a fastball. (Maile) hasn't seen me a lot but he definitely seemed to think it might be effective. Not all of them were but when I was disciplined on getting it down, that was important for me."	Aaron Loup got one out, Danny Barnes and Ryan Tepera each worked 1 1/3 innings and Roberto Osuna finished.	A Rule 5 pick from San Francisco, Biagini made 60 relief appearances for Toronto in 2016, and had 15 more before sliding into the rotation at Tampa Bay last Sunday.	"He's fantastic, man, the things he's been able to do for the ball club the last two years," Travis said. "Being able to step into the starting rotation, that's not easy, especially when you're not expecting it."	Seattle has lost two straight after winning the previous four. After scoring 21 total runs in consecutive victories over Philadelphia this week, the Mariners have scored two runs in back-to-back defeats to Toronto.	"As hot as we were with the bat in Philadelphia, we've been just as cold here in Toronto," manager Scott Servais said.	Mariners right-hander Christian Bergman (0-1) allowed three runs and seven hits in five innings.	"I thought he hung in there fine," Servais said.	Travis opened the scoring with an RBI groundout in the second. Bautista homered in the third, his second in three games.	Bautista had one homer and seven RBI in 25 games in April. He has three homers and seven RBI in 11 games so far in May.	Travis made it 4-0 with a sacrifice fly off Jean Machi in the sixth.	Seattle put runners at second and third with one out in the third but couldn't score. Third baseman Darwin Barney knocked down Jean Seagura's grounder and got an out while keeping Taylor Motter at third, and left fielder Steve Pearce ended the inning with a full-length diving catch on Ben Gamel.	HOME RUN DERBY	Toronto has hit 17 homers in its past 11 games in May after hitting 22 in 25 April games.	WALK THIS WAY	Biagini has not walked a batter in any of his past 13 outings, covering 21 1/3 innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: RHP Felix Hernandez (shoulder) felt sore after playing catch twice last week and will back off his throwing program, manager Scott Servais said. ... 2B Robinson Cano (right quadriceps) was held out of the starting lineup for the second straight night but was able to take part in batting practice. Cano left Tuesday's win at Philadelphia after four innings with the same injury. ... RHP Steve Cishek (hip surgery) made his first rehab appearance at Triple-A Tacoma on Thursday, striking out two in a scoreless inning. He'll make at least one more appearance with Tacoma before being activated. ... OF Mitch Haniger (right oblique) will swing off a tee for the first time Saturday.	Blue Jays: SS Troy Tulowitzki (right hamstring) will begin a rehab assignment at Class-A Dunedin on Saturday and is expected to be activated next Wednesday in Atlanta. ... LHP J.A. Happ (elbow) is throwing up to 120 feet on flat ground and will try throwing off a mound next week. Happ remains approximately three weeks away from returning. ... Kendrys Morales (left hamstring) ran without pain during batting practice but did not start for the third straight game.	UP NEXT	Mariners: Seattle has yet to name a starter for Saturday.	Blue Jays: RHP Marcus Stroman (3-2, 3.38 ERA) pitched six shutout innings against Cleveland in his previous outing, winning for the first time in three starts. The Mariners are the only AL opponent Stroman has never faced.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

BOSTON -- Alex Cobb was coasting along and before he knew it, he was watching the bullpen hold onto a tight victory.	Cobb took a one-hit shutout into the seventh inning before tiring, Evan Longoria hit a homer over the Green Monster completely out of Fenway Park and the Tampa Bay Rays held off the Boston Red Sox 5-4 on Friday night.	"We had an opportunity to really cave there, with things working against us," Cobb said. "We were shooting ourselves in the foot a little bit. But to be able to get out of the funk we're in, we've got to be able to win ballgames like that."	Coming off a 3-6 home stand, the Rays rebounded with just their second win in six games in Fenway this season.	"Nice win. Never a dull moment," Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash said.	Boston's Xander Bogaerts singled to extended his hitting streak to 15 games, the majors' current longest active streak. He had a career-best 26-gamer last year.	Cobb (3-3) gave up four runs -- three earned -- and three hits after getting the first out in the seventh, adding to his trouble with a throwing error. Alex Colome got the final four outs for his ninth save.	Reigning AL Cy Young Award winner Rick Porcello (2-5) gave up five runs -- three earned -- with seven strikeouts in six innings for his second rough outing against the Rays this season. He lost only four games last year.	"Just two innings where I didn't make pitches with runners on base, and I ended up getting hurt by it," Porcello said.	Trailing 5-0, the Red Sox chased Cobb and sliced the deficit to one with the help of Tampa Bay's shoddy defense. Sandy Leon had a two-run double, Cobb fired wildly past first base, allowing a run to score, and second baseman Brad Miller was charged with two errors on one play, booting a grounder and throwing the ball away, scoring another.	"Tonight we got handcuffed for the first six innings of work, but when you think back to the period of time that you're outlining, I think there's been a number of positive things that continue to show through," Red Sox manager John Farrell said.	Tim Beckham's two-run single had pushed the Rays ahead in the fourth -- with both runs unearned after third baseman Josh Rutledge bounced a throw.	They added three runs in the fifth. Corey Dickerson had an RBI double high off the wall in center field before Longoria hit his shot over a billboard above the Monster seats, a drive estimated at 406 feet.	Porcello was tagged for eight runs in 4 1/3 innings in a home loss to the Rays on April 14.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: Cash expects OF Steven Souza Jr. (bruised right thumb) to be back in the lineup on Saturday. ... RHP Tommy Hunter, on the 10-day DL with a strained right calf, is set to throw a bullpen Saturday.	Red Sox: Farrell said DH Hanley Ramirez was "a little bit improved" and he's optimistic that the slugger will be in the lineup Saturday. He left Wednesday's game in Milwaukee with a strained right shoulder after starting at first base. ... Farrell said INF Marco Hernandez (injured left shoulder) could need a procedure that would "likely" be season-ending.	MESSAGE	Many of the vendors entering the park were given buttons to wear with "B Respectful" written on it. The "B" was the club's logo for Boston.	It was the first series in Fenway Park since Baltimore's Adam Jones said a fan yelled a racial slur at him.	TIME CHANGE	Saturday's game, which was scheduled for a 7:05 start, was moved to 1:05 with the forecast for heavy rain starting later in the day and into Sunday.	UP NEXT	Rays: LHP Blake Snell (0-3, 3.96 ERA) hopes to rebound from a rough outing Monday against Kansas City when he gave up a career-high 10 hits in a loss.	Red Sox: LHP Chris Sale (3-2, 1.92) looks to extend his string of double-digit strikeout games. He's done it in every one of his six starts.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

MIAMI --  Tyler Flowers has been hitting the ball hard. On Friday night, it paid off with his first home run.	Flowers drove in four runs to help the Atlanta Braves end a six-game losing streak by beating the Miami Marlins 8-4.	"He's been swinging that bat really well. All season, really," Braves manager Brian Snitker said.	Flowers and Brandon Phillips each hit two-run singles during a six-run burst in the seventh inning that made it 8-1.	Mike Foltynewicz (1-4) allowed one run in six innings.	"This will be a good game for him to build on for the future," Snitker said. "It should boost his confidence and he broke his egg, too. Now he's got a win."	J.T. Realmuto, Justin Bour and Derek Dietrich hit home runs for the Marlins, who have lost four straight.	"It's a tough time and it's going to test us," Marlins manager Don Mattingly said. "Are we going to be tough or are we going to cave into it? It's real easy time to cave in and just say, `Things are going to go bad.'	"But that's not the way for us to approach it if we're going to go anywhere. It's part of us growing up and continuing to play no matter the circumstances. It's a time you find who you are," he said.	Jose Urena (1-1) gave up two runs in six innings.	Atlanta's Matt Kemp singled in the second to extend his hitting streak to 12 games. He is batting .358 (19 for 53) during the string.	Flowers hit a two-run shot in the second to give the Braves the early lead.	"It was either going to be a heater or a slider, I was banking on the heater," Flowers said. "I wasn't sure how I hit it. I'm still not. I don't know if it had backspin, topspin or what. I knew I hit it hard."	Bour hit his sixth homer in the fourth, but Foltynewicz only allowed one hit over the next 10 batters following the home run.	"If you leave any ball over the plate, they're going to put it over the fence," Foltynewicz said. "It was a big comeback game for me. I just wanted to do well and just get a little streak of ourselves going."	Marlins reliever Brad Ziegler gave up four runs in the seventh while getting just one out.	"Tonight, it didn't work out," Ziegler said. "I feel tomorrow I can go out and throw the same pitches and it's a two-hopper right to the shortstop and an easy double play. It's the way it goes sometimes."	Kyle Barraclough's balk and third baseman Derek Dietrich's error helped the Braves. Flowers, who led off the seventh by getting hit by a pitch, singled to cap the big inning.	"We just couldn't get out of that one," Mattingly said.	Realmuto hit a two-run homer in the seventh and Dietrich homered in the ninth.	MARLINS MOVES	INF Mike Aviles had his contract selected from Triple-A New Orleans while C Tomas Telis was optioned. INF Yefri Perez was designated for assignment and RHP Joe Gunkel was outrighted to Double-A Jacksonville.	PHILLIPS PRODUCTION	Phillips has 901 RBI in his career, 15th among active players.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: LHP Wei-Yin Chen (elbow) could return as early as next week. "He came in yesterday after his bullpen and he felt good and we'll just make sure that continues," Mattingly said. "We're feeling pretty positive about Wei-Yin with the way he's been feeling. I think he's been positive with the way he's feeling so I think we're getting there." ... INF Miguel Rojas (fractured right thumb) had surgery and is not eligible to be reinstated from the 60-day disabled list until July.	UP NEXT	Braves: RHP Julio Teheran (2-3, 4.69 ERA) will start the second game of the series on Saturday. He went 0-2 with a 6.75 ERA in three starts against the Marlins last season.	Marlins: RHP Edinson Volquez (0-4, 4.71) is expected to be reinstated from the 10-day disabled list due to a blister on his right thumb and take the mound for his first start since May 2 against Tampa Bay.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Joey Gallo knew he hit the ball far enough. The young slugger's only concern was if it would stay fair.	It did, and the Texas Rangers won with a game-ending three-run homer for the second night in a row.	Gallo's 12th homer of the season ricocheted high off the foul pole down the right field line for a 5-2 victory over Oakland on Friday night.	"I was like, `OK, that's gone.' And then it started hooking really quick," Gallo said. "That was the first one I ever hit off the foul pole, so that was pretty cool."	For the Rangers, the ending was pretty much a repeat of Thursday night, when Mike Napoli's three-run homer capped a four-run ninth inning to beat the San Diego Padres by the same 5-2 score.	"To win them in that kind of fashion ... it's momentum," Gallo said. "In a million years, I didn't think it would be the same three-run home run to win it."	Texas matched a season high with its fourth consecutive victory.	Jonathan Lucroy and Rougned Odor got the ninth started with consecutive singles. Napoli then hit a deep sacrifice fly to tie the game.	Odor was stopped at third when Carlos Gomez doubled into the right-center gap, but they all came home when Gallo pulled the full-count pitch off A's closer Santiago Casilla (1-2).	"We were trying to strike him out," manager Bob Melvin said. "Man on third, one out. He's a good hitter, but he's their biggest strikeout guy."	Gallo does have a majors-high 54 strikeouts, but is also second in the AL with the 12 homers and leads the Rangers with 27 RBI. He is playing regularly in place of veteran third baseman Adrian Beltre, who has been on the disabled list all season with a calf issue.	Gomez led off the Texas fifth with a double, went to third on an errant pickoff throw, then tied the game at 1-1 on a squeeze bunt by Delino DeShields. Gomez made a great headfirst slide around the sweeping tag attempt by catcher Stephen Vogt while reaching out to touch the plate.	"There was a lot of energy really," manager Jeff Banister said when asked about Gomez. "We've got a number of guys in that dugout that really do that. But yeah, (Gomez) set a nice tone for us."	Pinch-hitter Mark Canha put Oakland up 2-1 in the seventh when he lined an RBI double over the outstretched glove of 6-foot-5 third baseman Gallo and into the left-field corner. Canha was hitting for Matt Joyce, whose homer in the fifth had put the A's up 1-0.	GOOD WITHOUT A WIN	Rangers starter Andrew Cashner lowered his ERA to 2.43 by allowing only one run over six innings. But the Texas native is still without a win in six starts for the Rangers since signing with them during the offseason. Cashner, who has had a total of six runs of support, is the first Texas starter to allow three earned runs or less in each of his first six starts in a season without a victory since rookie Tommy Boggs' seven in 1976.	SHORT HOPS	Oakland's Jesse Hahn pitched seven strong innings, limiting the Rangers to one run and four hits and left with the lead. ... This is the fourth time in Rangers' history they won consecutive games with walk-off homers. ... Keone Kela (1-1), the fourth Rangers pitcher, went the last two innings.	NO K FOR KHRIS	While A's LF Khris Davis was 0 for 4, he didn't strike out for the first time in 22 games. That streak of 21 games in a row with a strikeout (33 total in that stretch) was the longest streak in team history by a non-pitcher.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: C Josh Phegley, who took a ball off his mask May 3, was reinstated from the 7-day concussion DL. ... RHP Sean Manaea is scheduled to come off the DL on Monday to pitch for the A's at Seattle. He's been out since April 27 because of a strained left shoulder.	UP NEXT	Athletics: RHP Sonny Gray is 6-0 with a 1.45 ERA in six career road starts in Texas. Gray has eight wins overall against the Rangers since the start of the 2014 season, the most by any pitcher against them in that span.	Rangers: RHP Nick Martinez is winless in four starts this season, but he is 4-2 with a 2.34 ERA in 50 career innings against Oakland.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Cahna pinch double:	https://mediadownloads.mlb.com/mlbam/mp4/2017/05/13/1380996283/1494641637658/asset-1800K.mp4	Lowrie gets Lucroy after ball off Jesse Hawn	https://mediadownloads.mlb.com/mlbam/mp4/2017/05/13/1380847583/1494640831353/asset-1800K.mp4	squeeze bunt	https://mediadownloads.mlb.com/mlbam/mp4/2017/05/13/1380717383/1494640100796/asset-1800K.mp4	Joyce HR	https://mediadownloads.mlb.com/mlbam/mp4/2017/05/13/1380605783/1494638981019/asset-1800K.mp4	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

CHICAGO --  By the time Brandon Maurer got the ball on Friday night, his rough outing at Texas was way back in the rearview mirror.	Just a little speedbump in a long season.	Maurer worked around a leadoff single while recording his fifth save, helping the San Diego Padres to a 6-3 victory over the slumping Chicago White Sox.	Austin Hedges, Matt Szczur and Wil Myers homered for San Diego in the 10th game ever between the teams. Allen Cordoba had three hits, and Jhoulys Chacin (4-3) pitched into the seventh inning.	Maurer also pitched Thursday night and allowed four runs in the ninth inning of the Padres' 5-2 loss at Texas, including Mike Napoli's game-ending, three-run shot. Yolmer Sanchez opened the White Sox ninth with a leadoff single, but Maurer then retired three in a row.	"That's the only thing you're hoping to do is have the lead in the ninth and get out there and kind of redeem yourself a little bit," Maurer said.	Hedges drove in three runs with two out. He grounded a two-run double down the third base line in the third, giving the Padres a 3-0 lead. He delivered again in the fifth, hitting a drive to left off Miguel Gonzalez (3-3) for his eighth homer.	"He's an offensive threat anytime he's in the box," San Diego manager Andy Green said. "A pitcher makes a mistake, he's got the kind of power that can make somebody pay for it."	Leury Garcia connected twice for the White Sox, who have dropped six in a row and nine of 11 overall. Manager Rick Renteria met with his coaches for about 20 minutes after the game.	Garcia had four homers in 183 career games coming into the day.	"We've been in trouble the last couple games, but we keep battling, we keep playing hard, and we know it's going to turn around," Garcia said.	Garcia's fourth homer of the season chased Chacin and trimmed San Diego's lead to 5-3 with one out in the seventh. But the Padres used four relievers to close out their second win in their last nine games.	Jose Torres and Kirby Yates finished off the seventh before Ryan Buchter worked the eighth and Maurer closed it out. Buchter got some help from his defense when first baseman Yangervis Solarte went into the stands for a terrific catch on Matt Davidson's foul popup for the final out of the inning.	Gonzalez allowed five runs and eight hits in five innings. The right-hander also walked four and struck out two in his third straight loss.	"It felt like every inning they had someone on," he said. "I didn't have my best stuff tonight. I was just off, just felt tight."	MANY HAPPY RETURNS	Szczur homered on the first pitch of the game in his return to Chicago after he was designated for assignment by the Cubs last Saturday. It was his third start in four games with the Padres, who acquired him in a trade on Monday.	"It was an easy transition for me," Szczur said. "All the guys are great, and it's been enjoyable so far."	IN MOURNING	The White Sox will play the series with a short bench while starting shortstop Tim Anderson is back home in Alabama for the funeral of a close friend. The team was not able to use the bereavement list for Anderson because he did not lose a relative.	"Like I said, good for the organization for doing something like that for him," Renteria said. "Yeah, we're going to be one short but that's OK. We'll deal with it."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: It sounds as if RHP Jarred Cosart (right hamstring strain) will be activated from the disabled list at some point this weekend. "Not happening today, obviously," Green said. "My initial thought is probably pushing it to Sunday."	White Sox: C Geovany Soto (right elbow inflammation) is scheduled to visit a doctor on Monday.	UP NEXT	Padres right-hander Trevor Cahill (3-2, 3.06 ERA) tries to win his third consecutive start in the second game of the series on Saturday night. Rookie right-hander Dylan Covey (0-3, 8.28 ERA) gets the ball for the White Sox, looking for his first major league win in his sixth start.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	---	Jay Cohen can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/jcohenap	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.

MILWAUKEE --  Matt Harvey allowed a season-high three homers. He tied a season high by giving up five walks. He said he fell behind too many hitters.	It was not an ideal return for Harvey from a three-game suspension in the New York Mets' 7-4 loss on Friday night to the Milwaukee Brewers.	But after a drama-filled week, the Mets can take a little solace from a few positives in Harvey's otherwise choppy night.	Eric Sogard and Orlando Arcia hit back-to-back homers to chase Harvey from the mound in the sixth after the right-hander had sailed through the fifth for his only 1-2-3 inning of the night.	"I hope he takes that and that the stuff is still good enough and start to apply it to his next start," manager Terry Collins said.	Harvey (2-3) allowed seven hits and five runs in his first outing in 10 days. He worked out of a jam in the second after walking the bases loaded by striking out .331 hitter Eric Thames.	"I'm sure he's upset about the sixth inning. He limited the damage. He was in big trouble two innings in a row and really got us out of it," Collins said.	At least Harvey was back on the mound, focused on getting better after a tough week. He has apologized for skipping a game last weekend following a late night on the town.	When asked, Harvey said he felt no residual effects mentally from the stress of the past few days.	"No I mean I felt physically great going into this game, mentally great going in and wanted to go out there, do everything I could to put zeros up on the board," he said. "I just wasn't able to do that."	Sogard, whose contract was selected earlier Friday from the minors, hit a two-run shot into the second deck in right to break a 2-2 tie. Arcia's pinch-hit solo homer chased Harvey from the mound three batters into sixth with nobody out.	Sogard, who was hitting .330 at Triple-Colorado Springs, also walked twice. He had a .239 career average with eight homers in previous stints with the Oakland Athletics between 2010-15.	"Harvey was having trouble throwing strikes for whatever reason, (Sogard) got himself in good counts all night," manager Craig Counsell said. "He sat on the pitch, and put a good swing on it."	GOOD GARZA	New York's Neil Walker went 3 for 3, including a solo homer off Matt Garza (2-0). The Brewers starter was otherwise solid, giving up five hits, two runs and two walks while striking out four over six innings.	"Mixing and matching. Just got to keep them off balance and keep attacking," Garza said.	The Mets scored twice in the ninth before Jared Hughes got the last two outs of the game for his first save.	METS WOES	Harvey's return was overshadowed in part by yet another twist in the Mets' season.	The team announced that All-Star closer Jeurys Familia would be out several months because of a blood clot near his right armpit. Familia had surgery earlier Friday, and general manager Sandy Alderson said he was unsure if Familia would return this season.	CLOSER CHANGE	Neftali Feliz is out as the Brewers' closer. He was 8 of 9 in save opportunities but 0-4 with a 6.19 ERA in 18 appearances. General manager David Stearns said Feliz in part was getting in trouble after falling behind the count and becoming a "little more predictable pitcher at that point." Manager Craig Counsell said both Feliz and setup man Corey Knebel, who has a 1.00 ERA, were not available on Friday, so he mixed and matched out of the bullpen.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: The team did get a key piece back with 1B Lucas Duda returning from a stint on the 10-day disabled list with a hyperextended left elbow. Duda hit seventh and went 1 for 4, bouncing into an inning-ending double in his first at-bat in the second.	Brewers: Sogard took the roster spot of Braun, who was placed on the 10-day disabled list before the game with a strained left calf, retroactive to Thursday. Stearns said he expected a short stay for Braun on the DL.	UP NEXT	Mets RHP Robert Gsellman (2-2) will make his first career start against an opponent outside the National League East when he faces the Brewers. He'll be opposed by RHP Zach Davies (3-2), who is 3-0 with a 3.43 ERA over his last four starts after going 0-2 with an 8.79 ERA over his first three starts.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Eric Hosmer's hitting surge is helping the Kansas City Royals pile up some wins.	Hosmer delivered another key hit, doubling home the go-ahead run in the eighth inning to lead the Royals to a 3-2 win over the Baltimore Orioles on Friday night.	Lorenzo Cain singled with one out and Hosmer doubled to right-center field off Vidal Nuno (0-1). The Royals won for the fourth time in five games.	Hosmer is hitting .403 with a .581 slugging percentage, six extra-base hits and 10 RBI in his past 16 games. He has raised his batting average 97 points from .192 to .289 in that span.	"I think anytime its close and especially late in the ballgame and those type of hits fall, it's definitely a good sign," Hosmer said. "Especially the way our pitching has been. Our bullpen did a great job, coming in and giving us a chance. As an offense, that's all you ask for."	Hosmer was unsure whether Orioles center fielder Adam Jones might track down the ball.	"I was watching all the way and hoping it would fall," Hosmer said. "Off the bat I knew it had a chance, but at the same time I got a good look at him running down a lot of balls in the World Baseball Classic. With him out there, you never feel safe when that ball is in the air."	Joakim Soria (2-1) worked a flawless eighth to pick up the victory and Kelvin Herrera earned his sixth save in seven chances.	Brandon Moss hit a towering 456-foot shot into the right-field water fountains off Dylan Bundy in the fifth, giving the Royals a 2-1 advantage.	"I threw it down, middle third, and he was able to get out on it," Bundy said. "He hammered that thing, too. I knew it gone as soon as he hit it."	Caleb Joseph had two doubles, a triple, was hit by a pitch, scored a run and drove in a run for Baltimore.	Bundy came out after six innings and 112 pitches. Bundy, who was 4-0 in his previous five starts, gave up two runs on four hits, while walking one and striking out eight.	Mike Moustakas and Cain hit back-to-back doubles in the first.	J.J. Hardy tripled with one out in the second when the ball rolled past a diving Jorge Soler in right field. It was Hardy's first triple since June 5, 2012, and the Orioles' first triple this season. He scored on Joseph's double.	Joseph doubled in the seventh and later scored on Duffy's wild pitch, tying it at 2.	"Duffy's been tough on us," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. "He's a really good pitcher.  He's having a really good year.  He's quietly pitching about as well as anybody.  We knew runs were going to be at a premium."	Duffy left after seven innings, yielding two runs on eight hits. He walked one, hit a batter and struck out six.	"I wanted to pitch 13 innings today, that's how good I felt," Duffy said.	BATTING NINTH	Royals LF Alex Gordon batted last for only the second time in his career. Gordon is in a 1-for-27 skid over nine games. "There's just not a lot of production," Royals manager Ned Yost said. The only other time Gordon batted ninth was July 29, 2010. Gordon left in the seventh inning with right groin tightness.	RUGGED SCHEDULE	The Royals began a 26-game stretch Friday against clubs that are currently above .500. Their opponents have a 119-78 record.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: C Welington Castillo (right shoulder tendinitis) will begin a rehab assignment Saturday with Double-A Bowie. He will be the designated hitter for both games of a doubleheader and then catch Sunday.	Royals: RHP Ian Kennedy (right hamstring strain) threw a bullpen session Friday. He is eligible to come off the disabled list Tuesday.	UP NEXT	Orioles: RHP Chris Tillman will make his second start of the season since coming off the disabled list with a shoulder issue.	Royals: RHP Nathan Karns matched his career high with 10 strikeouts in his previous start against the Rays.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ST. LOUIS -- The Chicago Cubs were looking for a catalyst to get them back on track and found what they needed in their battery.	Catcher Willson Contreras connected twice for his first career multihomer game, Eddie Butler threw six scoreless innings in his season debut and the Cubs beat St. Louis 3-2 Friday, ending the Cardinals' six-game winning streak.	The Cubs won for just the second time in seven games.	"It feels good coming in here and helping the guys win," Butler said. "Me and Willy had a big game plan going into it and we followed it pretty well. I ended up getting the guys a couple zeros there and they put up some runs."	Chicago played without NL MVP Kris Bryant, who was scratched from the lineup with a stomach virus. He's already been ruled out for Saturday's game.	Butler (1-0), who pitched the last three seasons with Colorado and was traded to the Cubs before spring training, gave up two hits. He struck out five and walked three.	Butler started in place of the injured Brett Anderson. The only two hits he allowed were infield singles by Aledmys Diaz, including a bunt.	"Eddie was really good wasn't he," Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. "He was really good. Probably walked more than what you see out of him but had really good stuff. I thought he was very, very good and it set the whole game up for us actually."	Wade Davis got his eighth save in as many tries.	Contreras homered twice off Mike Leake (4-2), who entered with the National League's best ERA and had only given up one home run in six starts.	"We just didn't barrel the ball up enough and we couldn't find enough holes," Leake said. "Games like that are going to happen."	Contreras, who had 12 home runs in 2016, hit solo homers in the second and fourth innings. He has four this year, three in St. Louis.	Tommy La Stella also homered for the Cubs. Once Bryant was scratched, Jon Jay got into the lineup, but he exited in the second inning with back spasms and La Stella entered.	Randal Grichuk homered in the St. Louis seventh off Carl Edwards Jr. The Cardinals had two runners on later in the inning, but Dexter Fowler got picked off at first on a snap throw by Contreras to end the threat.	For all of his offensive fireworks, it was his defense that Contreras was more pleased with after the game.	"(The offense) means a lot," he said. "But the pick off at first was bigger."	CROWD PLEASER: The Cubs-Cardinals rivalry typically draws well, and this game drew 47,601, the third-highest total for a regular season game at the new Busch Stadium.	TRAINER'S ROOM: Cubs: INF Addison Russell wasn't scheduled to play for the second consecutive game with a sore right shoulder but pinch hit in the eighth and drew a walk.	Cardinals: Fowler (shoulder) returned to the starting lineup after a six-game stretch during which he had two pitch-hit at bats.	UP NEXT	Cubs: LHP Jon Lester (1-1, 3.27) starts for Chicago.	Cardinals: RHP Carlos Martinez (2-3, 3.86) goes for his third consecutive win after beginning the year 0-3 with two no-decisions.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DENVER -- Clayton Kershaw became a 20-game winner against Colorado -- the most victories any pitcher has ever recorded versus the franchise.	Know what that says?	"I pitched against them a lot," he said.	Kershaw worked his way out of trouble time after time over seven solid innings, Chase Utley had a two-run triple as part of a five-run second and the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the NL West-leading Rockies 6-2 on Friday night.	"The box score probably doesn't tell the whole story. There was a lot of bad pitching," Kershaw said while holding his young son. "I'll take it tonight, though."	Cody Bellinger added a solo homer in the eighth to help the Dodgers pull within 1 1/2 games of Colorado.	Kershaw (6-2) ran his record to 89-0 in the regular season when the Dodgers give him at least four runs of support. He also improved to 20-6 against the Rockies, surpassing fellow lefty Randy Johnson for most all-time wins against the team.	On a tranquil evening, Kershaw allowed two runs and seven hits, but worked his way out of trouble with the assistance of three double plays.	"It wasn't pretty and nothing was great about it by any means," Kershaw said of his outing. "Guys got some runs early for me. Yeah, it wasn't pretty, but I'll take the win any day of the week."	The Dodgers took advantage of an erratic Tyler Chatwood (3-5), who walked four and allowed five runs over 4 1/3 innings.	"You've got to throw the ball over the plate and if they beat you getting hits, you can live with that," Chatwood said.	In the pivotal second, Los Angeles sent nine batters to the plate and drew three walks, all of which scored. Utley hustled for his second triple of the season and Corey Seager added a two-run double.	"Walks," Chatwood lamented. "Walks are the thing that killed us."	Those five early runs were more than enough for Kershaw, who doesn't need much.	"It's just a credit to him to get through that start with not having his best stuff," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.	The Rockies might argue that point.	"We just don't have too many opportunities against him and when we do he's one of the toughest to come through on," Rockies second baseman DJ LeMahieu said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: Roberts sees INF Adrian Gonzalez (right elbow soreness) going on a rehab assignment next week to play two or three games. ... The last time Roberts heard from OF Andre Ethier, his back was giving him some problems when he runs or bends over. "Physically, he's just limited," Roberts said. "If someone told me late June (for a return), I'd be very excited."	Rockies: RHP Jon Gray (stress fracture in his left foot) has been cleared to step out of his boot for an hour a day. Soon, he will start running/walking in the pool to strengthen the foot. "Slowly transitioning out of it," he said. "Hopefully, it doesn't take three or four weeks." ... C Tony Wolters (concussion) went 0 for 3 and caught six innings in his first rehab assignment with Triple-A Albuquerque.	ROSTER MOVE	RHP Jeff Hoffman was optioned to Albuquerque after picking up his first major league win Thursday. The team recalled OF Raimel Tapia, who entered as a pinch hitter in the eighth and walked.	BELTING BELLINGER	Bellinger hit his seventh homer and leads the team despite only playing 16 games.	"I keep trying to find days to give him a blow, but it's hard to omit him from the lineup," Roberts said.	THIS & THAT	Rockies OF Carlos Gonzalez finished with two hits and an RBI. ... OF Charlie Blackmon hit his sixth triple. All of them have been at Coors Field. ... With his double in the eighth, Dodgers C Yasmani Grandal has an extra-base hit in five straight games.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: LHP Alex Wood (3-0, 2.73 ERA) has struck out 38 and walked 10 in 29 2/3 innings this season.	Rockies: LHP Tyler Anderson (2-3, 6.69 ERA) had his start pushed back to Saturday because of inflammation in his left knee. He will wear a protective brace.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

PHOENIX -- Whether it was ill will or just an accident, a fastball to the face stirred more bad blood between the Arizona Diamondbacks and Pittsburgh Pirates.	Dripping blood, Chris Iannetta was taken to a hospital after a 93 mph pitch hit him in the nose and mouth Friday night in Arizona's 11-4 win over the Pirates. And the sight of him sprawled face down at the plate conjured up memories of the recent, raw trouble involving these teams.	Iannetta, who had homered earlier, turned into a heater from reliever Johnny Barbato in the seventh inning. After several minutes, the Arizona catcher was helped to his feet and walked off, holding a cloth to his nose.	"Everything was OK," Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said. "He split his lip open and he's at the hospital right now to get further exams. Anytime there's head trauma, anytime there's something that hits you in that area, you're never comfortable until a diagnosis has been made so we're using every precaution to make sure that he's OK."	In the ninth, Arizona reliever Tom Wilhelmsen hit Pittsburgh's Chris Stewart in the leg. Stewart quickly went to first base without incident.	Lovullo stared silently for several moments when asked, if given the history between the clubs, whether this was a matter still to be finished.	Finally, he said, "I thought the pitch just got away from their pitcher. I'll stand by that."	Barbato said that's exactly what happened.	"It got away from me," he said. "Definitely a relief when he can get up on his own. I'm going to try to reach out to him and make sure he is all right. It's kind of scary. Hopefully he is all right."	Back in 2014, Diamondbacks slugger Paul Goldschmidt was hit by Ernesto Frieri of the Pirates in August and missed the rest of the year with a broken hand. The next day, Pirates star Andrew McCutchen was drilled in the back with a fastball.	Last May, Arizona's Jean Segura was hit in the face during a game in Pittsburgh, setting up another round of retaliation.	The mood in the Diamondbacks' clubhouse was tempered by Iannetta's injury.	"Even after a big win like that, we still kind of had that (bad) feeling in the clubhouse after the game," said Brandon Drury, who homered. "We all hope he's OK. I think he is. But it's just not good anytime anybody gets hit in the face."	Iannetta homered to start a seven-run third inning. Drury hit a three-run homer during the burst.	Drury also doubled and singled to improve his batting average at home to .448 (30 of 67), best in the majors.	David Peralta had three hits, including an RBI double and Jake Lamb had a two-run single for the Diamondbacks, who tied a season-high with 16 hits.	Patrick Corbin (3-4) went six innings and gave up four runs, two on Josh Bell's homer.	Tyler Glasnow (1-3) lasted just 2 1/3 innings, giving up seven runs on seven hits.	Gregory Polanco drove in two runs for Pittsburgh, which has lost eight of 10.	Iannetta joined the Diamondbacks this season.	"He is a veteran, he is well-liked, he's a leader," Lovullo said, "and he went down. It hurts. It's part of the game that I don't enjoy whatsoever. Unfortunately it is part of the game."	"But the guys were there to support him and love him up, which was what he needed. We'll get him back on his feet, dust him off and get him back in there as soon as possible."	ROSTER MOVES	The Pirates made a pair of roster moves with the return of third baseman David Freese and utility player Adam Frazier from the disabled list. Infielders Chris Bostick and Max Moroff were sent to Triple-A Indianapolis.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: Freese had been sidelined since April 26 with a right hamstring strain. Frazier had been on the DL since April 23 with a left hamstring strain.	UP NEXT	In the third game of the series, RHP Trevor Williams (1-2, 7.98 ERA) makes his second start for Pittsburgh after moving into the rotation when Jameson Taillon left to begin treatment for testicular cancer. RHP Taijuan Walker (3-2, 3.83) starts for the Diamondbacks.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Matt Shoemaker finally showed off his 2016 form.	Shoemaker held the Detroit Tigers to three hits in six innings, leading the Los Angeles Angels to a 7-0 victory on Friday night.	"That looks like Shoemaker when he's on," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "He was terrific."	Mike Trout and Luis Valbuena homered to lead a 14-hit attack for the Angels, who enjoyed their largest margin of victory this year.	Shoemaker (2-2) struck out seven and walked one. He improved to 3-1 with a 0.83 ERA lifetime against the Tigers.	"I don't know if it's baffling to me," said Tigers manager Brad Ausmus. "Shoemaker has kind of stuck it to us since I've been here."	Shoemaker is a Michigan native who pitched at Eastern Michigan University. He said he gets a little fired up to pitch against his hometown team.	"I was just being aggressive and pitching with intent," Shoemaker said. "Now I have to pitch that way against every team."	The Angels scored runs against Jordan Zimmerman (3-2) in four of his six innings. Valbuena's solo home run started the scoring in the second and Trout's two-run blast completed it in the eighth.	Zimmerman was charged with five runs on 10 hits and three walks in his 5 1/3 innings.	"The velocity is pretty good, it's the command," Ausmus said. "He threw some good breaking balls, they just weren't consistently in the spot he wanted."	Valbuena and Cliff Pennington each had three hits. Andrelton Simmons and Kole Calhoun had two apiece.	The Tigers looked as though they would break through first when they loaded the bases with no outs in the second inning, but Shoemaker got the next three outs.	"You have to calm yourself down in those situations and just execute pitches," Shoemaker said.	Shoemaker was never in trouble again. He retired his last 10 consecutive batters.	Blake Parker, David Hernandez and Keynan Middleton completed only the second shutout of the season for the Angels.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: Placed outfielder Jim Adduci on the 10-day disabled list with a right oblique strain retroactive to May 11 and reinstated J.D. Martinez from the DL. Martinez (foot sprain) was immediately placed in the lineup and batted sixth.	Angels: Closer Cam Bedrosian, on the disabled list since April 22 with a right groin strain, has yet to throw off a mound. Scioscia said he still needs more long toss, but could be scheduled for the mound next week.	SECOND BASE WOES	Struggling second baseman Danny Espinosa (0 for 34) remained benched against the Tigers, with Scioscia starting Pennington. Said Scioscia: "Espy is a guy who in the field is a difference-maker. We definitely would like to get him where he needs to be. You have to balance that with the needs of the team."	UP NEXT	Tigers: Daniel Norris is scheduled to make his first career appearance against the Angels. He is 2-2 with a 4.55 ERA on the season, but for his career is 7-1 with a 3.27 ERA on the road.	Angels: Right-hander Ricky Nolasco (2-2) is coming off the Angels' only 10-strikeout performance of the season. He held the A's to two runs in seven innings on Monday, but their opening-day starter is still searching for consistency (4.31 ERA).	---	This story has been corrected to show that Shoemaker's record is 2-2.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

SAN FRANCISCO -- After catching 269 pitches and watching his beleaguered bullpen escape jam after jam in extra innings, Buster Posey took matters into his own hands.	Posey homered with one out in the 17th inning for the latest walk-off homer in San Francisco history as the Giants beat the Cincinnati Reds for the first time this season with a 3-2 victory Friday night.	Posey sent the first pitch he saw from Robert Stephenson (0-2) over the left-field wall for his fourth homer of the week, ending the marathon game after 5 hours, 28 minutes. The Giants rushed out of the dugout to celebrate with Posey while the few remaining fans cheered.	"It wouldn't have been fun to lose this," Posey said. "We were out of pitching. Fortunately, got it done there."	Posey's game-ending homer was the latest for the Giants since they moved to San Francisco, topping Willie Mays' 16th inning shot off Warren Spahn that provided the only run in a 1-0 win against the Milwaukee Braves on July 2, 1963.	"I think Buster had enough," manager Bruce Bochy said. "That was huge for us."	Cincinnati had won seven of eight but couldn't get the big hit this game. The Reds were 0-for-10 with runners in scoring position and stranded 16 runners.	"To play 17 and lose, it's a lot different feeling in the Giants' clubhouse right now than it is in ours," manager Bryan Price said. "Both teams had an awful lot of opportunities to win that game, and no one could come up with the big hit until Posey did."	The Reds had won all four meetings so far between the teams, outscoring the Giants 34-7 in those games. They had plenty of chances to win this one as well, as they put multiple runners on base in three of the final four innings without scoring.	The Giants' Cory Gearrin (1-1) escaped a bases-loaded jam in the top of the 16th by striking out Billy Hamilton. He then stranded two more runners in the 17th to earn the win.	The best chance came in the 14th when Cincinnati put runners on second and third with one out. Jose Peraza then hit a hard grounder that shortstop Brandon Crawford bobbled before gathering it in time to throw Scott Schebler out at the plate. Bryan Morris then picked Scooter Gennett off second to escape the jam.	San Francisco got nine scoreless innings from seven relievers.	"Got to be a confidence booster for our bullpen," Posey said. "They did a great job with such a potent offense. Put up zeros as much as they did will be big going forward."	Denard Span got the Giants started against Scott Feldman with his 12th career leadoff home run, his second homer in as many games since coming off the disabled list Thursday. He added an RBI single to tie it in the fifth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: Hamilton was bothered by a sore calf and Price said he almost put a pitcher into center field to get Hamilton out of the game. He is day to day. ... LHP Tony Cingrani will have his next bullpen session pushed back a day or two because of soreness in his injured oblique.	Giants: Closer Mark Melancon (sore forearm) is expected to play catch Saturday for the first time since going on the DL earlier this week.	WORKHORSE	Cueto went a season-high eight innings, allowing only two runs in the second on an RBI triple by Gennett and a sacrifice fly by Tucker Barnhart. Cueto finished strong by getting Joey Votto to fly out with a runner on base with his 119th and final pitch of the game.	BUNT TO BUNT	The Giants opened the fifth inning with back-to-back bunt singles by Eduardo Nunez and Justin Ruggiano. Cueto followed with a third straight bunt to advance the runners on the sacrifice. Span followed with an RBI single to tie the game at 2.	TOUGH UMP	Home plate umpire Tony Randazzo had a scary moment in the fifth inning when he was hit in the mask by a 91 mph Cueto fastball. Hamilton squared to bunt and pulled the bat back at the last minute. Posey couldn't get his glove on it and the ball hit Randazzo and knocked him straight to the ground. Giants trainer Dave Groeschner rushed out to check on Randazzo, who stayed in the game. He then left after the 13th inning and was replaced by second-base umpire Clint Fagan.	UP NEXT	Lisalverto Bonilla (0-0, 7.20) will become the ninth pitcher to start a game this season for the Reds when he takes on Matt Moore (1-4, 6.52).	---	More AP baseball: apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

BOSTON --  Nothing complicated about Chris Sale's strong start with the Boston Red Sox. It's just more of the same from his time with the White Sox.	Sale struck out 12 while pitching seven solid innings and Mookie Betts hit a two-run homer, leading the Red Sox to a 6-3 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays on Saturday.	It was Sale's seventh straight start with double-digit strikeouts. The 6-foot-6 left-hander allowed three runs and two hits, both homers.	"It's almost a carbon copy of each of the six previous starts, with the exception of a couple of pitches that leave the ballpark," Red Sox manager John Farrell said.	Betts also doubled in a run in Boston's four-run fifth inning. Jackie Bradley Jr. had two hits, including his first double of the season, and Deven Marrero drove in two runs, helping the Red Sox to their 14th win in their last 19 games against the Rays.	Sale (4-2) has struck out 10 or more in every start since he had seven Ks in his Boston debut after he was acquired in a blockbuster offseason trade with Chicago.	"Just finding a good rhythm and tempo," Sale said. "That's the key to pitching, going out there and trying to get in a groove. It was nice that when I hit rough patches, my team was right there to pick me up today."	Kevin Kiermaier and Logan Morrison homered for Tampa Bay, which has dropped seven of 11.	The game was moved from 7:05 p.m. to 1:05 p.m. because of heavy rain forecasted for late afternoon into Sunday.	Pitching in his usual short sleeves on an unseasonably cool day under cloudy skies, Sale mixed his mid-90s fastball with his terrific slider and an occasional changeup for another solid outing. He got Evan Longoria looking on a 94-mph fastball in the sixth for his 10th strikeout.	Joe Kelly worked the eighth before Craig Kimbrel finished the three-hitter for his 11th save. The Rays fanned 16 times.	"Obviously today we saw a lot of power," Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash said. "The first six or seven innings they've got the best lefty in the American League throwing. Look, they've got a lot of weapons, but that's something eventually we'll need to overcome."	Boston led 2-1 before Kiermaier hit a two-run shot on an 0-2 fastball with two out in the fifth.	But the Red Sox rallied in the bottom half. Marrero hit a two-run double off the Green Monster against Blake Snell (0-4). Betts followed with his RBI double, and Xander Bogaerts added a run-scoring grounder.	Snell allowed six runs and six hits in 5 2/3 innings.	"When you face (Sale) and your team gives you three runs, you need to lock it down," he said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: OF Steven Souza Jr. returned to the lineup after missing the previous four games with a bruised right thumb. ... RHP Tommy Hunter, on the 10-day disabled list with a strained right calf, threw a bullpen session and felt fine.	Red Sox: DH Hanley Ramirez, who left an interleague start at first base earlier this week with a muscle spasm in his right shoulder, was out of the lineup for the third straight game, but Farrell said he could be available Sunday. ... LHP Dave Price, sidelined since early spring training with a strained left elbow, is set to make a rehab start for Triple-A Pawtucket on Sunday.	CHASING PEDRO	Hall of Famer Pedro Martinez is the only other Red Sox pitcher to reach seven straight double-digit strikeout games. He posted eight twice, his last coming in the final starts of his AL Cy Young Award-winning 1999 season.	MORE SALE	Sale has 85 strikeouts through eight starts, tied with Randy Johnson -- then with Houston in 1998 -- for the most ever by a pitcher after their initial eight starts with a new team.	JUMP	First base umpire Laz Diaz had to jump out of the way of a rolling bat that got away from Tampa Bay pinch hitter Brad Miller.	UP NEXT	Rays: RHP Matt Andriese (2-1, 3.12 ERA) is set to start the series finale Sunday. He has given up three or fewer runs in his last six starts.	Red Sox: LHP Drew Pomeranz (3-2, 5.23 ERA) looks to rebound from a rough outing when he gave up six runs in four innings during a loss Tuesday.	---	More AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

TORONTO --  The Toronto Blue Jays got another home run from Jose Bautista. The Seattle Mariners lost another starting pitcher to an injury.	So it was more of the same for each team.	Bautista hit a three-run shot and Kendrys Morales also went deep, helping Toronto beat Seattle 7-2 on Saturday for its sixth win in seven games.	The Mariners promoted right-hander Ryan Weber from Triple-A Tacoma to start against the Blue Jays, and he left after 3 2/3 innings with a sore shoulder.	Seattle already has four starting pitchers on the disabled list. Right-handers Felix Hernandez (shoulder) and Hisashi Iwakuma (shoulder) and left-handers James Paxton (forearm) and Drew Smyly (elbow) are not expected back before June.	"It's been a wild year so far," Mariners manager Scott Servais said with a rueful smile. "We're six or seven weeks into this thing and we had our ninth starter out there today. It's hard to imagine you could ever plan for anything like this."	Weber was not available to speak to reporters. He had left the stadium to see a doctor.	"Any time a pitcher grabs his shoulder like that, it's pretty significant," Servais said. "We'll have a better idea tonight or tomorrow of where he's at."	Toronto also has dealt with injuries. The Blue Jays have three starting pitchers and three regulars on the disabled list, a group that accounts for $84 million in salary.	"It kind of came as a blessing that Seattle came in here banged up a little bit with their pitching staff," Blue Jays outfielder Kevin Pillar said. "We're trying to capitalize on them not having their entire rotation."	Pillar had three hits, raising his AL-leading total to 47. Devon Travis became the first player to steal home for the Blue Jays since June 2, 2015, scoring on a double steal in the eighth.	Dominic Leone (1-0) got one out for the win as Toronto improved to 8-4 in May.	The Mariners have dropped three in a row since a four-game winning streak.	Bautista broke a 2-all tie with a drive into the center-field party deck off Nick Vincent (1-1) in the seventh.	"He's a hot hitter right now," Vincent said. "I probably should have kind of pitched around him."	After going deep just twice in his first 33 games, Bautista has homered three times in four games.	"He's not missing the balls he's been fouling off," manager John Gibbons said. "Now he's starring to hit them. He's taking a good healthy swing."	Toronto opened the scoring on Ezequiel Carrera's two-out RBI single in the third, but the Mariners responded with Ben Gamel's RBI double in the fifth. It was Seattle's first run since the first inning on Thursday, snapping a 21-inning scoreless streak.	Jarrod Dyson gave the Mariners a 2-1 lead with an RBI single in the sixth. Morales tied it again when he connected off Tony Zych for his seventh of the season in the bottom half.	Blue Jays right-hander Marcus Stroman allowed two runs in six innings. Stroman struck out nine, one shy of his season high.	DANGER ZONE	When Travis lost the handle on his bat while swinging in the fifth, the bat sailed into the stands and struck a fan seated behind the third base dugout.	GRAND LARCENY	Catcher Russell Martin was the last Blue Jays player to steal home, accomplishing the feat in the second half of a doubleheader at Washington. A catcher was also involved in Saturday's double steal: Luke Maile stole second as Travis came home from third.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: 2B Robinson Cano (right quadriceps) missed his third straight game. ... Iwakuma is expected to miss four to six weeks.	Blue Jays: Morales returned after sitting out the previous three games with a sore left hamstring.	UP NEXT	Mariners: LHP Ariel Miranda (3-2, 5.00 ERA) makes his eighth start of the season Sunday. Seattle has won each of Miranda's past three starts. He has never faced the Blue Jays.	Blue Jays: RHP Aaron Sanchez (0-1, 4.05 ERA) will be activated off the disabled list to start Sunday. Sanchez returned from a blister issue against Tampa Bay on April 30 but lasted only one inning.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ST. LOUIS --  Starter Carlos Martinez has been filling a variety of roles for the St. Louis Cardinals.	For Joe Maddon and the Chicago Cubs, the focus Saturday was more on the rules.	Martinez had his second straight two-hit game and started a disputed double play to help the Cardinals beat the Cubs 5-3.	In the fifth inning, Chicago's Ian Happ was charged with interference on a hard slide into second base. On a grounder by Anthony Rizzo, Happ slid past the bag while shortstop Aledmys Diaz fielded a flip from Martinez, and Rizzo was ruled out when umpires made the interference call. Kyle Schwarber had scored from third base, but that run was nullified by the double play, keeping the Cardinals ahead 3-1.	"I have no idea why these rules are a part of our game. Outs are rewarded based on a fabricated rule," Maddon said. "I'm not blaming the umpire. Umpires do what they have to do. I think we have a tendency to micromanage stuff that we have no business to do. Don't give me all protectionism stuff because I'm not buying into it. It's wrong."	Cubs starter Jon Lester is not a fan of the slide rule either.	"We're out there playing with a bunch of pansies right now," Lester said. "I'm over this damn slide rule. We're all grown men out there. I told Happ in the dugout to do the exact same thing the next time. It's baseball man."	In a rematch of the season opener, Martinez (3-3) again topped Lester (1-2). Martinez allowed three runs, five hits and four walks over 6 2/3 innings, striking out seven.	Martinez also scored Tommy Pham on a squeeze bunt in the third inning. Lester tried to field the ball and flip it home, but the attempt came up short while Martinez took second with nobody covering.	"I got the green light from (manager Mike) Matheny to execute the bunt and everything turned out good," Martinez said.	Martinez doubled leading off the fifth inning. In his previous start May 8, he doubled and drove in four runs.	"Just an overall great day for Carlos," Matheny said.	Happ, a top Cubs prospect, homered off Martinez in the seventh for his first hit in his major league debut.	"He's very calm and a confident young man," Maddon said. "What you saw today was not a surprise to any of us. He's obviously an interesting young player.	"He was never overwhelmed by being here today. He put the uniform on and went out there and hit a homer."	Pham had two hits, two RBI, a walk and a stolen base. The outfielder is batting .387 with seven extra-base hits in eight games since being recalled from Triple-A this month.	Seung Hwan Oh pitched the ninth, giving up a two-out single before picking up his 10th save in 11 opportunities.	Lester labored, throwing 112 pitches in 5 2/3 innings. He allowed six hits and four runs, three earned, walked four and struck out nine.	St. Louis went ahead 3-1 in a two-run fourth inning. Jedd Gyorko led off with a home run, and Yadier Molina followed with a single and then stole his 50th career base. Pham singled Molina home after Greg Garcia's sacrifice bunt.	ROUND FIGURE	Maddon is 999-869 as a manager while guiding the Angels (twice in an interim role), Tampa Bay and the Cubs. With his next win, he will be the eighth active manager to reach 1,000 wins, joining Bruce Bochy, Dusty Baker, Mike Scioscia, Buck Showalter, Terry Francona, Clint Hurdle and Net Yost.	RECORD CROWD	The Cardinals and Cubs drew 47,882 fans. It is the largest ever baseball crowd at Busch Stadium III.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: Reigning NL MVP Kris Bryant missed his second game with a stomach flu. ... SS Addison Russell (right shoulder) was out of the starting lineup for a third consecutive game. Russell pinch hit in the seventh and grounded out.	Cardinals: Michael Wacha was supposed to start but was pushed back until next week.

SAN FRANCISCO --  The San Francisco Giants needed a lengthy outing from Matt Moore, and he delivered.	Moore pitched into the eighth inning, Brandon Belt and Justin Ruggiano homered and the Giants beat the Cincinnati Reds 3-1 on Saturday in a matchup of weary teams.	San Francisco and Cincinnati had a quick turnaround after they played 17 innings Friday night, with the Giants winning 3-2 on Buster Posey's game-ending homer.	Moore (2-4) provided a lift with 7 1/3 innings of one-run ball. He allowed eight hits, struck out seven and walked three.	"It was really needed for us for him to get us deep in the game," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "He really gave us a little more than I thought, to be honest."	The last-place Giants (14-24) won consecutive games for just the second time this season. They have won three of four overall.	"You've got to start somewhere," Bochy said. "We're trying to look at the positive signs here. It's good to get a couple in a row against a team that was really tough at their ballpark."	Scott Schebler homered for Cincinnati, which swept a three-game series against San Francisco last weekend. Lisalverto Bonilla (0-1) pitched a six-hitter for his first career complete game.	The Giants jumped in front on Belt's long drive in the first inning. Belt's second homer of the series and No. 6 on the year sailed into the San Francisco Bay for his sixth career "splash hit."	Ruggiano connected in the second for his first homer with the Giants. Schebler went deep in the sixth, but the Reds were 0 for 8 with runners in scoring position.	"The last couple of games we haven't been able to deliver those big hits," Reds manager Bryan Price said.	"We had a lot of opportunities to end last night's game before the 17th. They pitched us tough just like we pitched them tough. Neither team could come up with the big hits to get that create separation."	Derek Law pitched a scoreless ninth inning for his third save in four tries.	SURVIVOR	Instincts may have saved Moore when Joey Votto hit a line drive up the middle in the seventh inning. Either that or luck. The left-hander caught the ball for the second out.	"It was like, I threw the ball and now my hand is hurting. That was it," Moore said. "It was a big out. With two strikes and him hitting the ball that hard I kind of got lucky there."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: OF Billy Hamilton was out of the lineup with calf tightness. Manager Bryan Price said he had already planned to rest the speedster. ... Injured RHPs Homer Bailey (elbow), Nefi Ogando (right thumb) and Anthony DeSclafani (strained elbow) are all progressing, Price said. Bailey, who underwent surgery earlier this year, reported no pain after a 48-pitch bullpen Friday at the team's extended spring training facility in Arizona. Ogando will pitch next in the minors on a rehab assignment. DeSclafani will join the team Friday so coaches can monitor his progress.	Giants: OF Hunter Pence (hamstring tightness) was out of the starting lineup for a second straight day. Pence appeared in Friday night's 17-inning game as a pinch hitter.	UMPIRE SWITCH	Umpire Ryan Blakney replaced Tony Randazzo, who left Friday's game in the 13th inning after being hit in the mask earlier in the game.	UP NEXT	Reds right-hander Tim Adleman (2-1, 4.44 ERA) will make his first career appearance against the Giants on Sunday. He is 2-0 with a 4.09 ERA in his last two starts. Right-hander Jeff Samardzija (0-5, 5.44 ERA) pitches for the Giants. He is 2-5 with a 4.00 ERA in 25 career appearances against Cincinnati.	---	More AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

CLEVELAND -- Jose Berrios had no problem handling the Cleveland hitters. Waiting for a squirrel to scram, now that took patience.	Berrios pitched neatly into the eighth inning in his first start of the season and the Minnesota Twins beat the Indians 4-1 Saturday in a game delayed several minutes when a squirrel ran around the field.	"It was fun because I've seen that before on TV, but never right in front of me," Berrios said.	The squirrel appeared from right field with Michael Brantley batting in the Cleveland sixth. Play was halted as the critter cut across the infield, angled past the mound and ran around the home plate area, drawing a loud cheer from the crowd at Progressive Field.	Twins manager Paul Molitor left the dugout to speak with plate umpire CB Bucknor, and Berrios threw up his arms in frustration.	"I still can't figure that out, how long they were going to let that guy run around out there before someone got him," Molitor said.	Eventually chased toward right field by members of the grounds crew, the squirrel hopped into the stands and play continued, with Berrios retiring Brantley on a flyball.	"I felt sorry for Berrios because he was throwing a great game and had to wait, but it was fun to watch," said Twins right fielder Max Kepler, who homered. "That guy crawled down the wall right past me."	The home fans had little else to holler about as Cleveland was held to three hits for the second straight game by Minnesota.	"Those type of things are funnier when you're ahead," Indians manager Terry Francona said.	Kepler connected earlier in the sixth. The Twins have hit a home run in 14 straight games, their longest streak since 1988.	Berrios and the AL Central leaders handed Cleveland its third straight loss.	Called up from Triple-A Rochester on Friday, Berrios (1-0) gave up one run and two hits in 7 2/3 innings. He struck out four and walked one.	The right-hander was 3-0 and led the International League with a 1.13 ERA in six starts at Rochester. He 3-7 with an 8.02 ERA in 14 starts for Minnesota last season.	Brandon Kintzler pitched the ninth for his 10th save and third in three games.	Cleveland broke a 17-inning scoreless stretch on Berrios' wild pitch in the third. Minnesota won the series opener 1-0 Friday night.	The Twins' output in the fourth consisted of two walks, two wild pitches, a bunt hit, a throwing error by pitcher Mike Clevinger (1-1), a run-scoring groundout and Jorge Polanco's RBI single.	Minnesota has won 11 of 15 overall and is 11-4 on the road.	Clevinger allowed three runs and three hits while walking five in 4 1/3 innings.	Carlos Santana tripled in the third with two out on a drive to the center field wall. Byron Buxton leaped and got a glove on the ball, which bounced toward the field as Santana reached third.	"You've got to be excited about what we saw out of Jose," Molitor said. "He knows he had to fight to get back up here, and he attacked their hitters and limited the damage."	KEEP WORKING	Cleveland newcomer Edwin Encarnacion was 0 for 4 with a strikeout in the ninth inning, dropping his average to .213.	"I'm never going to feel frustration because I know what I can do," the slugger said. "It's a long season. I'm going to keep my head up and keep working hard."	Encarnacion, who signed a three-year, $60 million contract, has five homers and 11 RBI.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: OF Lonnie Chisenhall remained in the game after being hit on the right hand by a pitch in the eighth.	UP NEXT	Twins: LHP Hector Santiago seeks his first win over the Indians since Oct. 1, 2012. He has pitched against Cleveland 15 times in his career, posting a 2/3 record with a 4.77 ERA.	Indians: RHP Trevor Bauer allowed four runs in six innings in his last outing, taking a 4-2 loss at Toronto on May 8. He is 1-1 with an 8.18 ERA in two home starts this season.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

WASHINGTON --  Bryce Harper was money for the Washington Nationals on Saturday night.	Fresh from getting a big deal, Harper hit a game-ending home run with two outs in the ninth inning that sent the Nationals over the Philadelphia Phillies 6-4.	Hours before the game, the Nationals announced they had reached agreement with Harper on a $21,625,000 contract for the 2018 season, covering the slugging outfielder through his last year before he can become a free agent. Harper would've been eligible for salary arbitration next year.	"Nobody can say he ain't worth the money," manager Dusty Baker said after watching Harper's heroics.	On the day the deal was announced, the 24-year-old star provided an immediate payoff. Pinch hitter Adam Lind led off with a single against Edubray Ramos (0-3) and two outs later, Harper lined an 0-1 pitch over the wall in center for his 11th homer of the season.	"I tried to go John Wall," Harper said, referencing the Washington Wizards guard whose late 3-pointer lifted his team over the Boston Celtics in a playoff game Friday night. "Walk `em off a little bit.	"I know nobody wanted to play extras with a doubleheader ahead of us tomorrow. So, a huge win tonight."	It was Harper's second walk-off homer of the season and the fifth of his career.	"You have to want to be the man in that situation," Baker said.	Phillies manager Pete Mackanin, whose team squandered a four-run lead, said he didn't even think about pitching around Harper with Ryan Zimmerman on deck.	"He was looking for a heater out over the plate that he can get," Mackanin said. "(Ramos) missed his spot; it was pretty much down the middle, above the knees."	Trailing 4-0 in the fifth, Washington tied it on a two-run homer by Trea Turner and a two-run double by Zimmerman.	Shawn Kelley (3-0) pitched the ninth.	Washington relievers threw 4 1/3 scoreless innings, helping send the Phillies to their eighth loss in nine games.	Nick Pivetta made his third career start and second against the team that sent him to Phillies for Jonathan Papelbon and cash in 2015. He gave up four runs on five hits over 4 2/3 innings.	Washington starter Tanner Roark allowed four runs on six hits in 4 2/3 innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: RHP Aaron Nola (lower back strain) will make a second rehab start on Monday with the Triple-A Lehigh Valley IronPigs.	Nationals: OF Jayson Werth left after seven innings. "He was having some tightness in his groin," Baker said after the game "(From) when he went to break up that double play at second base. So we took him out of the game, it was a cold night and you're always fearful on nights like this of guys having some leg problems."	WE SHOULD SEE OTHER PEOPLE	Weather permitting, at the close of Sunday the Phillies will have played 12 of their first 35 games of the season against the slugging Nationals. "When you're facing teams of this caliber like the Nationals, that wasn't a good draw on our part," Mackanin said. After Sunday, the teams don't meet again until Sept. 7. Philadelphia is 4-6 so far against Washington.	COMFORT ZONE	Baker on Harper agreeing to a contract for 2018: "We always like to know where we are, where we're going. I think everybody likes to be comfortable, not to have to wonder what's in their future. And not only is he comfortable, he's very comfortable."	UP NEXT	Phillies: RHP Jeremy Hellickson (4-1, 3.49 ERA) faces the Nationals for the fourth time this season in the first game of Sunday's split doubleheader. He's 1-0 with a 2.70 ERA against them in 2017, and 2-3, with a 4.86 ERA lifetime.	Nationals: LHP Gio Gonzalez (3-1, 2.64) has allowed two earned runs or fewer in each of his last six home starts against the Phillies, a streak that dates to July 2014.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

CHICAGO --  After going more than a week without a win, the Chicago White Sox had to wait an extra 2 minutes before officially snapping a six-game losing streak.	Yolmer Sanchez singled with one out in the bottom of the ninth to score Tyler Saladino and give the White Sox a 5-4 victory over the San Diego Padres on Saturday night.	The play at the plate was close and went to replay. It was finally confirmed -- Saladino got under the tag of catcher Austin Hedges -- and the White Sox could celebrate.	"It was a rough week for us," Sanchez said. "But we battled every day and our heads were up.	"It was a good win for us."	Saladino went 2 for 3 with two runs scored and Avisail Garcia homered for Chicago.	Wil Myers, Manuel Margot and Allen Cordoba all had solo homers for San Diego.	David Robertson (2-0) pitched a scoreless top of the ninth for the win.	Brad Hand (0-3) took the loss.	Saladino started the rally with a lead-off walk. He was sacrificed to second and scored on Sanchez's single to center. Margot charged the ball, fired home and just missed extending the game.	"Great slide," Chicago manager Rick Renteria said. "I think that's what we were talking about in the dugout. What a fantastic slide."	Trailing 3-2, Chicago took the lead in the fifth. Kevan Smith singled and Saladino followed with a double. Leury Garcia tied the score with an RBI groundout. One out later, Melky Cabrera singled to center to give the White Sox a 4-3 lead.	That's where it stayed until the eighth when Myers tied it with a 433-foot blast to left-center after being knocked down on the previous pitch (a 97 mph fastball) from Tommy Kahnle.	"I thought Wil's at-bat where he hits the home run was a heck of an at-bat," San Diego manager Andy Green said. "A guy stands him up at 99, he digs back in and hits the next pitch out. You love seeing things like that."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: RHP Jarred Cosart (right hamstring strain) could be activated for the series finale on Sunday. "I'm not going to commit to that entirely right now," Green said before the game. "He's feeling good."	White Sox: RHP James Shields (right lat strain) has been sidelined more than three weeks, but a timetable for his return hasn't been announced. "He's continuing to progress and I'll leave it at that," Renteria said.	GREAT START II	Margot hit Chicago starter Dylan Covey's first pitch of the game over the fence in right field for a quick lead. It was the second straight game the Padres homered on the first pitch. Matt Szczur started Friday's series opener with a blast off Miguel Gonzalez.	The last team to homer on the first pitch in consecutive games was the Chicago Cubs on Sept. 19-20 in 2007. Alfonso Soriano hit both homers.	"That was pretty cool," Myers said. "I was really pumped for Manny, obviously for Szczur yesterday. I thought that was pretty cool to start the game that way."	REALLY SMALL BALL	Chicago's Jose Abreu is not known for his base running, but used his legs to manufacture a run in the fourth. Abreu reached on an error by third baseman Ryan Schimpf and then rounded the bases on three wild pitches by Trevor Cahill.	"They were curveballs, and I think I threw a changeup, too," Cahill said of the wild pitches. "I was trying to strike guys out on too good of a pitch instead of trusting. That was a tough inning, but I got through it and was good enough to continue on for a bit."	UP NEXT	Padres: RHP Jered Weaver (0-4, 6.81 ERA) still is looking for his first win of the season, but is 12-2 with a 1.89 ERA in 15 career starts against Chicago.	White Sox: LHP Jose Quintana (2-5, 4.46 ERA) starts the final game of the home stand on Sunday. He is tied for the most losses in the majors.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

MILWAUKEE --  Travis Shaw finished what he started during an eight-run fifth inning for the Milwaukee Brewers.	The Brewers' cleanup hitter singled to start the inning and smacked a three-run homer to cap it as the Brewers beat the New York Mets 11-4 on Saturday night.	"I think that's the first time I've ever gotten two hits in the same inning," Shaw said.	Shaw finished with three hits and four RBI.	"I'm hitting in a good spot in the order. It seems like there are guys on base all the time," Shaw said.	Milwaukee sent 11 batters to the plate in its highest scoring inning of the season. Orlando Arcia had a two-run single and Jesus Aguilar drove in two runs with a double before Shaw connected for his eighth homer, a shot off reliever Hansel Robles, who entering the game had tossed a career-high 14 straight scoreless innings dating to April 13.	"I'd seen everything away all night," Shaw said. "Then he came middle-in. I was able to react, get my hands up and get on it."	Neil Walker homered for New York, which has dropped three in a row. Robert Gsellman (2-3) was charged with six runs, five earned, and nine hits in four-plus innings.	"We are not seeing that good sinker. We are not seeing command of his secondary pitches. There is some concern there," Mets manager Terry Collins said.	Jonathan Villar added two hits and two RBI for the Brewers, who have won five of six.	Milwaukee right-hander Zach Davies (4-2) got the win despite allowing four runs and seven hits in five innings.	"I got bailed out," Davies said.	Gsellman was pulled after the first four batters reached in the fifth. Robles then came in and was charged with four runs and four hits while recording three outs.	CHANGING FIELDS	Jose Reyes, who didn't start for a second consecutive game, had never played in the outfield during his 15-year major league career. That all changed in the sixth inning when he entered the game in center field. Reyes played one inning there before moving to shortstop after Asdrubal Cabrera re-aggravated a left thumb injury.	"I wanted to get him out there," Collins said, adding that Reyes would have played the remainder of the game in center had he not been forced to remove Cabrera.	"We talked about it in the spring. We planned on playing (Reyes) out there," Collins said. "When David (Wright) went down that put that kibosh on it."	FAMILIA UPDATE	Mets closer Jeurys Familia had a successful procedure Friday to repair a blocked artery near his right armpit. The team said Saturday in a statement that the right-hander can resume throwing in six weeks and should pitch again this year.	Collins had feared Familia was dealing with thoracic outlet syndrome, which ended the season of Mets right-hander Matt Harvey last year. Thoracic outlet syndrome involves the compression of blood vessels and nerves that extend from the neck to the shoulder, and the condition often causes numbness and pain in the shoulder and arm.	"I was concerned that any time those blood clots get in certain places, they can cut off the blood supply and then, all of a sudden, the muscles don't fire like they once did," Collins said. "This is not the case here."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: Cabrera isn't expected to be in the lineup Sunday due to the thumb issue. "We will probably give him a day off tomorrow. Let him get some treatment on it," Collins said. ... Pitchers Steven Matz (left elbow inflammation) and Seth Lugo (right elbow inflammation) each threw 30 pitches over two innings in an extended spring training game in Florida. ... 1B Lucas Duda remained in the game after being hit on the left knee by a Davies pitch in the third inning.

MIAMI --  Julio Teheran was in complete control.	The right-hander allowed three hits over six scoreless innings and the Atlanta Braves beat the Miami Marlins 3-1 on Saturday night.	"That might be as crisp and as good I've seen Julio since I've been here," Braves manager Brian Snitker said. "And he's pitched some really good ball games. His stuff -- I thought the ball was coming out of his hand really good. He pitched around some trouble. It was a real solid outing."	Nick Markakis had three hits and drove in a run, Darby Swanson also drove in a run, and Matt Kemp extended his hitting streak to 13 games with a single in the eighth for the Braves.	Teheran (3-3) beat the Marlins for the first time in seven starts. He struck out four and walked two while throwing 94 pitches.	"It was a really good outing I felt after two rough ones," Teheran said. "I've been working hard to get back and pitch well and like I pitch. Everything was working today, getting ahead, competing."	Jim Johnson pitched a perfect ninth for his sixth save in eight chances.	Justin Bour homered in the third consecutive game for the Marlins, who have lost five straight and 14 of their last 17, dropping to last place in the NL East behind the Braves.	"You can't quit right now, it's May," Marlins centerfielder Christian Yelich said. "If everyone in here quits it's going to be a pretty long year. Obviously it's a really tough stretch. It's been hard. It's been five in a row we've lost and that's never fun, but it happens. Like Donnie (Mattingly) said you can't fold up shop yet. It's not even Mother's Day yet."	The retractable roof and operable walls were open for the fifth straight game, which is the most in a row since Marlins Park debuted in 2012. The Marlins are 0-6 with the roof open this season.	Miami's Edinson Volquez (0-5) made his first start since May 2 after being reinstated from the disabled list due to a blister on his thumb and allowed two runs and four hits in six innings.	"I feel good," Volquez said. "My blister didn't bother me today and I was able to make a lot more pitches tonight. I can't blame anybody for the loss. Whatever happens over there is part of the game. There's nothing to complain about."	Volquez did not allow a hit until the fourth inning when Freddie Freeman's fly ball dropped in for a double as left fielder Marcell Ozuna lost the ball in the lights.	"It's one of those balls that gets up in a certain time of night," Marlins manager Don Mattingly said. "Usually when you play outdoors there's that certain time of night you'll always see guys that say, `Hey make sure we're pointing' because that ball just gets lost at that time of day."	Freeman scored on a base hit by Markakis, who scored on a base hit by Swanson later in the inning for a 2-0 lead.	"Great, especially off a guy like that," Swanson said. "He's tough. He's got three good pitches, especially how he can command his stuff. He's tough to square up. You saw it tonight with our bats. We just kept grinding out our at-bats."	Bour hit a home run off Eric O'Flaherty to lead off the seventh cutting the deficit to 2-1. It was Bour's first career home run off a left-handed pitcher in 135 plate appearances.	Kemp's infield hit in the eighth to charging third baseman Derek Dietrich led to a run when Dietrich's throw went past Bour at first base.	Marlins' right-hander Brian Ellington was optioned to Triple-A New Orleans to make room for Volquez.	FIFTY FOR TEHERAN	Teheran recorded his 50th career victory after making his Major League debut with the Braves as a 20-year-old in 2011.	"I know it's 50, but hopefully we have a long way to go and you have to stay healthy," said Teheran, who is 50-43 over 137 starts.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: LHP Wei-Yin Chen (arm) had a bullpen session cut short on Saturday due to discomfort. "It didn't go as well as we would have liked today so we'll just see where that goes," Mattingly said. "So we're at a little bit of a holding pattern with Wei-Yin."	UP NEXT	Braves: RHP R.A. Dickey (3-2, 4.29 ERA) will start the series finale Sunday. Dickey is 10-2 with a 2.87 ERA in 15 games, 13 starts, over his career against the Marlins.	Marlins: LHP Justin Nicolino will make his season debut on Sunday. Nicolino went 3-6 with a 4.99 ERA in 18 appearances with 13 starts last season.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Nate Karns won a spring training competition to earn the fifth slot in the Kansas City rotation. In his last three starts, he has been dominant.	Karns struck out a career-high 12 in five innings, Eric Hosmer reached base four times and the Royals beat the Baltimore Orioles 4-3 on Saturday night.	Karns is the first in franchise history to strike out 12 in five innings. The last pitcher to accomplish that was Jake Arrieta of the Chicago Cubs on June 5, 2016.	"That's pretty cool, but as a starter I'd like to go deeper in games," Karns said. "The strikeouts are great, but I really want to go deep as I can and help the ballclub win, but having 12 in five is something special, but it's really too short of a game."	In his past three starts, Karns has allowed four runs and 11 hits in 17 1/3 innings while striking out 29.	Baltimore's Chris Davis homered off Seth Maness (1-0) to tie it 3-3 in the sixth, but Brandon Moss went deep off Alec Asher (1-2) to put Kansas City back ahead later that inning. Moss has homered in consecutive games.	"The story the last two nights, for me, is we just haven't scored any runs," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. "I'll just give their pitcher credit, but we're capable of better, too."	Hosmer had two hits and walked twice. The Royals scored three runs in 4 1/3 innings off Chris Tillman.	"As the game wore on, I felt like I tried to do too much," Tillman said. "I kind of got out of my delivery and started falling behind guys and staying behind them, as opposed to making my pitch early on and getting in a count that favors pitchers."	Karns has 48 strikeouts in 40 1/3 innings this season, but has also allowed eight home runs, including a pair to Francisco Pena on Saturday. Pena homered in the third and fifth innings, the second and third homers of his career.	Sacrifice flies by Lorenzo Cain and Jorge Bonifacio in the fifth gave the Royals a 3-2 lead.	Maness was making his Royals' debut and his first big league appearance since Aug. 13 because of elbow surgery.	Mike Minor pitched two perfect innings for Kansas City and has allowed one run in 14 2/3 innings in his past eight appearances. Kelvin Herrera worked a perfect ninth for his seventh save in eight chances.	Hosmer doubled to start the second and scored on Salvador Perez's single. Hosmer is hitting .422 in his past 17 games to raise his average to .299.	THE DARK SIDE	Showalter thought the baseballs were too dark Friday. Before each game, balls are rubbed with a New Jersey mud from a Delaware River tributary to take the shine off.	"That's something they're working on," Showalter said. "Each night the balls are a different color. Can you imagine if you had other sports that did that? You've got to see the ball, right? It depends on how much the guys who are rubbing the balls up want to make them that night. Doesn't that seem a little strange to you? I find it a little strange that we play with a different ball in the minor leagues than we do in the big leagues."	NINE FOR NINE	2B Whit Merrifield became the ninth Royal to bat ninth this season. Raul Mondesi started 12 games batting ninth before being optioned April 21 to Triple-A Omaha. Backup C Drew Butera has batted last seven times. None of the others have more than four starts hitting ninth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: C Welington Castillo (right shoulder tendinitis) began his minor league rehab assignment at Double-A Bowie, serving as designated hitter for a doubleheader. He went 1 for 4, was hit by a pitch and walked. He is scheduled to catch Sunday and join the Orioles on Tuesday in Detroit.	Royals: LF Alex Gordon, who left in the seventh inning Friday with right groin tightness, was not in the lineup. Manager Ned Yost said if Gordon is not close to 100 percent Sunday, he would sit him again, and with the day off Monday, that would give him three days to recuperate.	UP NEXT	Orioles: RHP Kevin Gausman starts the series finale. He is coming off perhaps his best start of the season, holding the Nationals to five hits and two runs over seven innings with eight strikeouts and one walk.	Royals: RHP Chris Young will make his second start of the year. He is 1-8 in his past 14 starts.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  The Texas Rangers rallied before the very end this time.	Elvis Andrus and Nomar Mazara had consecutive two-RBI hits in another late four-run outburst, this one in the seventh inning instead of the ninth like the previous two nights, and the Rangers beat the Oakland Athletics 6-5 on Saturday night for their season-best fifth straight victory.	"We don't want to always win close," said Mazara, who lined a tiebreaking two-run double to the left field wall. "We'd like to put a lot of runs together, but it's always good to win games."	Texas loaded the bases in the seventh when reliever Ryan Dull (1-2) allowed a hit and two walks before Liam Hendriks replaced him. Andrus then grounded a single through the left side of the infield to tie it at 4 before Mazara's second double of the game.	The Rangers were coming of consecutive 5-2 wins when they scored four runs in the ninth inning each night capped by three-run homers. Mike Napoli's game-ending homer beat San Diego on Thursday, and Joey Gallo's blast won the series opener against Oakland on Friday.	"Look, we'll take those anytime we get them," manager Jeff Banister said. "Where we are and where we've been and kind of how we're trending, we'll take any of those any way we can get them."	Texas matched AL West-leading Houston for the longest current winning streak in the majors. But the two-time defending division champs are still eight games back of the lead. The Rangers gained only a half-game in the standings during their streak, only because the Astros got rained out at Yankee Stadium and didn't play Saturday.	Tony Barnette (1-0) got the latest win despite allowing three hits and a run in one inning. Keone Kela gave up a run in the eighth before Matt Bush struck out two in a perfect ninth for his third save in four chances.	Yonder Alonso hit his 12th homer in the eighth for Oakland to extend his career high after an earlier RBI single. Matt Joyce's two-run single in the fifth put the A's up 3-2, though he was thrown out trying to get back to first base after a wide turn.	"It looks like it's going to go down in the corner and it hit the stool, kicked back out and it looked like it caught him by surprise," A's manager Bob Melvin said. "Now he's trying to get back to first and gets thrown out."	FOR STARTERS	Oakland's Sonny Gray allowed two runs over six innings, and left with a 3-2 lead in his attempt to make it seven wins in his seventh career road start against the Rangers.  "I was able to manage through the game tonight a little bit better than I have," said Gray, who made only his third start since being on the DL to start the season with a strained right shoulder. "At the same time, I still don't feel really sharp." ... Nick Martinez is winless in 11 consecutive starts for Texas since his victory last Aug. 5 against Houston. Martinez gave up three runs in six innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: Reliever Sean Doolittle, out since April 30 with a strained left shoulder, is only doing strengthening work. He hasn't yet progressed to any kind of throwing motions yet.	Rangers: RHP Tyson Ross (thoracic outlet syndrome) threw three innings in a rehab start at extended spring training in Arizona. He allowed three hits and one earned run while throwing 45 pitches. ... 3B Adrian Beltre, on the DL all season with right calf tightness, took some grounders going laterally in both directions.	UP NEXT	Athletics: When Kendall Graveman pitched at Texas the first week of the season, the righty held the Rangers without a hit until Napoli's two-out solo homer in the seventh inning. Graveman, then 2-0, is since 0-2 with a 4.65 ERA in last four starts.	Rangers: A.J. Griffin (4-0) has won four consecutive starts, matching the longest streak in his career. He has a 1.38 ERA in that span, including a four-hit shutout in his hometown of San Diego last Tuesday.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

DENVER --  For the first time, left-hander Alex Wood was in a groove at hitter-friendly Coors Field.	Wood struck out 10 in six innings and drove in a run with a well-placed bunt on a squeeze play, leading the Los Angeles Dodgers past the Colorado Rockies 4-0 on Saturday night.	"You have enough bad ones here, eventually you're able to have a good one," Wood said with a smile. "That's just kind of how it went tonight. I just felt the execution was there. That was the biggest part for me. You never know what your ball is going to do, but I felt like I was able to command it pretty good. And I felt that was the difference for sure."	Wood (4-0) fanned at least one batter in five of his six innings and struck out the side in the third en route to reversing a dismal history at Coors, where he had gone 0-2 with an 11.25 ERA in four previous starts.	"He's found a nice rhythm.," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. "Obviously, this is a tough place to pitch and to give us a six-inning shutout was big. Then, go the `pen and those guys did their thing."	Wood has 21 strikeouts in his last two starts, fanning a season-high 11 last time out in beating the Pittsburgh Pirates on Monday.	"He's commanding the ball, he's changing speeds, he's throwing his three pitches at any time and he's on a nice roll," Rockies manager Bud Black said.	Brett Eibner supplied additional offense with his first home run of the season and Austin Barnes and Justin Turner added RBI doubles for the Dodgers, who won their 100th game at Coors Field, the most by any visiting club.	The Rockies, shut out at home for the second time this season, had five hits off Wood, all singles. They had no better luck against relievers Josh Fields, Pedro Baez and Kenley Jansen, who combined to throw three innings of two-hit ball.	"It was tough for us to put a rally together," the Rockies' Carlos Gonzalez said. "We hit sharp line drives right at the corners. They pitched well. Wood is having a good year."	A couple of sparkling defensive plays by the Dodgers also hemmed in the Rockies, whose NL West-lead over Los Angeles dwindled to one-half game.	First baseman Cody Bellinger turned an unassisted double play in the sixth, spearing Gonzalez's searing line drive and catching Nolan Arenado, aboard with a walk, off the bag.	With a runner on second in the eighth, third baseman Turner ranged to his left to snag Arenado's line drive before it could get through the hole. A frustrated Arenado pounded his bat into the dirt after Turner made the play.	Tyler Anderson (2-4) had eight strikeouts in 5 2/3 innings but the Dodgers managed to make solid contact when they did connect. Five of their seven hits went for extra bases, including Eibner's homer leading off the fifth that soared into the stand of evergreens beyond the wall in center field.	STRONG FINISH	Taking no chances with a four-run lead, Roberts brought on closer Jansen in a non-save situation in the ninth, and he finished the shutout, getting two strikeouts. "By the book, it was a non-save situation but here in Denver, it's almost like four runs is a save," Roberts said. "For him to take the baseball and not let these guys have any life and put them away says a lot about him as a teammate."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: 2B Logan Forsythe, sidelined since April 19 with a right toe fracture, ran the bases Saturday and was slated to move on to a rehab assignment next Tuesday.	Rockies: C Tony Wolters, placed on the 7-day DL with a concussion May 3 after being struck in the head by the back swing of a bat in San Diego, has begun his rehabilitation assignment with Triple-A Albuquerque. He caught six innings against Nashville and was 1 for 4 with a home run as the designated hitter for Albuquerque on Saturday night. ... CF Charlie Blackmon was not in the starting lineup for the first time this season as Black decided to give him a break. "I thought it was the right day to give him a night (off) from starting." Blackmon remained available for pinch-hitting.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: LHP Julio Urias (0-0, 1.06 ERA) is making his fourth start of the season and looking to break through for his first win.	Rockies: Rookie RHP Antonio Senzatela (5-1, 2.86 ERA) has pitched at least six innings in all four of his starts at Coors Field, winning three. He's facing the Dodgers for the first time in his career.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

PHOENIX --  This time, Trevor Williams looked like he belonged in the Pittsburgh Pirates' rotation.	Pitching just down the road from where he played collegiately at Arizona State, Williams threw five strong innings and the Pirates snapped a six-game losing streak with a 4-3 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Saturday night.	Nick Ahmed homered twice for the Diamondbacks, the second to make it a one-run game in the ninth. It was Ahmed's first career multihomer game. Paul Goldschmidt also homered for Arizona.	Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said it's been important not to overreact during this rough stretch.	"I've been fortunate to be in the game 43 years. I know a lot of things don't work -- manage like your hair's on fire, overplay everything, overreact to things," he said. "These are men. They've got to play. They've got to figure things out on their own."	Williams (2-2), in his second start since taking the rotation spot vacated when Jameson Taillon left to begin treatment for testicular cancer, gave up a run on four hits, striking out four and walking one.	Williams retired the last 12 batters he faced.	He had been hit hard for eight runs in three innings against the Dodgers in Los Angeles on Monday night. But the only run he allowed Saturday was Ahmed's leadoff homer in the second.	Williams said he told himself to forget about that outing.	"That's not me out there," he said. "That's not a Trevor Williams outing. I'm glad I was able to come out here five days later and get back on the right track."	Williams, called "an old-school" pitcher by Hurdle for his windup and the way he rubs up the ball, threw three pitches or fewer to batters eight times.	"The game demands execution," Hurdle said. "At the end of the day, you have to execute to win. We executed better than them today. They made a couple of mistakes on their side of the ball. We scored two runs without an RBI."	Tony Watson, coming off his first blown save of the season, survived a scare to get his eighth save in nine tries.	He gave up Ahmed's homer with one out in the ninth but got Jeff Mathis to fly out to center.	Pinch-hitter Daniel Descalso walked and A.J. Pollock's broken-bat pop out to third ended the game.	"We all thought something magical was going to happen," Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said, "but unfortunately it didn't."	Taijuan Walker (3-3) gave up four runs, three earned, on eight hits in six innings to take the loss, only the seventh at home for the Diamondbacks in 22 games.	Andrew McCutchen had a run-scoring double and John Jaso a pinch-hit RBI single for the Pirates.	Both players had been off to slow starts at the plate.	"He left a curveball up," McCutchen said. "I finally got something up in the zone and was able to do some damage to it."	The game was played without incident a night after Arizona's Chris Iannetta was hit in the face with a fastball from Pittsburgh's Johnny Barbato.	Pittsburgh took the lead in the fourth. The Pirates loaded the bases with no outs and tied it at 1-1 when Francisco Cervelli bounced into a double play. Jordy Mercer was walked intentionally to bring up Williams and second baseman Brandon Drury booted a routine grounder to allow the Pirates to go up 2-1.	The Diamondbacks, at 15-7, still have the best home record in the National League.	IANNETTA'S INJURIES	Iannetta has several stitches in his upper lip, plus a couple of fractured teeth and a broken nose after getting hit in the face by a fastball. Tests for a concussion were negative but Lovullo said Iannetta would be monitored closely. There's been no decision on whether to put him on the 10-day disabled list, the manager said.	But he won't be rushed back.	"The obvious concerns are, being a catcher and the mask, foul tips, just ripping open wounds," Lovullo said, "so we're going to take our time with this one."	Arizona has two other catchers -- Mathis and Chris Herrmann.	UP NEXT	RH Ivan Nova (3-3, 2.23 ERA) takes the second-best ERA in the National League to the mound to try to give the Pirates a split of their four-game series in Arizona. LHP Robbie Ray (2-3, 4.14) goes for the Diamondbacks. He's fourth in the NL in strikeouts.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- For the first time since last September, J.D. Martinez stepped on home plate, smacked his chest a few times with his right hand and then looked up, pointing to the sky.	A few innings later, he got to celebrate all over again -- a welcome sight for his Detroit Tigers.	Martinez powered up in just his second game of the season, hitting his second homer of the game in the ninth inning to lift the Tigers over the Los Angeles Angels 4-3 on Saturday night.	"I still feel like I'm just trying to feel it out," Martinez said. "It was just one of those things where I ran into a couple of balls today."	Martinez opened the ninth with a solo shot off Bud Norris (1-2) to snap a 3-3 tie. He came off the disabled list Friday after missing the Tigers' first 33 games with a sprained right foot.	"You can tell how much we missed him based on this one game," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.	Martinez opened the scoring in the second inning, following Victor Martinez's single with a two-run homer off Ricky Nolasco.	"I'm just happy I can contribute to the win today," he said. "I've been down there just watching the team, wishing I could do something. It was one of those frustrating things."	Martinez said his foot still hurts and expects it will all season.	"It's something I already have in my mind," he said. "The doctor said it's normal. He said I'm not going to do anything wrong to it. You want it to feel better, you have to rest it. We have a season to play, so you don't have time to rest."	It remained 2-0 until the fifth, when Los Angeles' Albert Pujols poked a two-run single off starter Daniel Norris. That gave Pujols 1,844 RBI, tying Carl Yastrzemski for 11th on baseball's career list.	Alex Wilson (1-1) pitched the eighth and got the win. Justin Wilson struck out three in the ninth for his second save.	Justin Upton hit a solo home run in the sixth for his eighth of the season and a 3-2 lead.	The Angels tied it in the seventh when Mike Trout crushed a solo home run off Shane Greene for his 10th of the year.	Norris went 5 2/2 innings for the Tigers, allowing two runs, seven hits and two walks while striking out four.	Nolasco pitched six innings, surrendering three runs, five hits and four walks with four strikeouts.	"He's not quite where he wants to be, and at times when he's not making his pitches, he's paying the price for it," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: Ausmus had no concerns about J.D. Martinez after his first game Friday. Martinez batted sixth Saturday.	Angels: C.J. Cron (left foot bruise) started his fourth rehab game for Triple-A Salt Lake, Scioscia was uncertain how many additional games he would play before rejoining the Angels. He is 5 for 12 with a home run.	ESCOBAR EXITS	Angels third baseman Yunel Escobar left after the fifth when he felt a hamstring tighten up. Scioscia called him day to day, which makes him unlikely for Sunday's quick turnaround for an afternoon game. Scioscia said Cliff Pennington, Jefry Marte or Luis Valbuena could play third.	UP NEXT	Tigers: Justin Verlander (3-2, 4.25 ERA) will be looking for his third consecutive victory in the series finale against the Angels on Sunday. He is 6-7 lifetime against the Angels.	Angels: Right-hander Alex Meyer is scheduled to make his fourth start of the season. Meyer (1-1, 7.62 ERA) has struggled with his command, walking 12 and allowing 14 hits in his 13 innings.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

TORONTO --  Even as he rounded the bases on his first career walkoff home run, Kevin Pillar was thinking about how he wanted to share the special moment with his mom.	Pillar homered with two outs in the ninth inning to give the Toronto Blue Jays a 3-2 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Sunday and a sweep of their four-game series.	After delighting the Mother's Day crowd of 42,030 with a blast to left off Edwin Diaz (1-2), his fifth, Pillar wriggled away from a group of celebrating teammates at home plate and scampered into Toronto's dugout.	"I wanted to keep my jersey on because I told my mom we'd get a picture after the game," Pillar said. "I didn't want it to rip completely. I saw what happened to (teammate Ryan Goins after a game-winning hit against Cleveland on Wednesday). His jersey is not even recognizable anymore."	Pillar was still wearing his jersey during an on-field television interview moments later when infielder Darwin Barney doused him with Gatorade. Even so, a few orange stains didn't dampen the mood for Pillar's eventual family photo.	"It's a great way to wrap up Mother's Day," Pillar said. "Those are memories that I'll remember the rest of my life and we've got the photo to remember it."	Pillar came in leading the AL with 47 hits, one ahead of New York's Starlin Castro.	"Pillar's been swinging the bat probably as hot as anybody in the league," Seattle manager Scott Servais said.	Justin Smoak added a two-run homer for Toronto, which has won five straight and seven of eight.	The Mariners have lost four straight following a four-game winning streak. They scored six runs over the four games in Toronto after scoring 21 in their previous two games.	"That's really what cooled off obviously, our bats," Servais said.	The Blue Jays lead the majors with 21 homers in May.	Ryan Tepera (3-1) pitched 2 1/3 innings for the win.	Pillar also made a jumping catch in center, taking a hit away from Danny Valencia in the fourth, when Seattle had runners at first and second.	"You can't say enough good things about how Kevin is playing," Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. "He's having a tremendous year."	Smoak gave the Blue Jays a 2-1 lead with his shot off James Pazos in the sixth. The Mariners responded in the seventh when Jarrod Dyson hit a leadoff blast against Dominic Leone.	Blue Jays right-hander Aaron Sanchez (blister) was activated off the 10-day disabled list before the game, and allowed one unearned run in five innings.	Sanchez had not started since April 30, when he lasted just one inning against Tampa Bay because his troublesome middle finger started bleeding. Prior to that abbreviated outing, Sanchez pitched 5 1/3 innings against Baltimore on April 14.	Sanchez acknowledged that his finger was bleeding at times during the game, but said it didn't affect him.	CENTER OF ATTENTION	The last Blue Jays center fielder to hit a walkoff home run was Vernon Wells, who did it against New York Yankees closer Mariano Rivera on July 20, 2006.	NEW PARK ON LONG BALL LIST	Dyson's eighth career homer was his first outside of Kansas City's Kaufman Stadium. Dyson spent his first seven seasons with the Royals before joining the Mariners this season.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: 2B Robinson Cano (right quadriceps) missed his fourth straight game. ... Seattle put RHP Ryan Weber (right biceps) on the 10-day DL and recalled RH Dan Altavilla from Triple-A Tacoma. ... RHP Jean Machi, who was designated for assignment Saturday, was outrighted to Tacoma.	Blue Jays: LF Steve Pearce left with a sore right calf after a double in the second. Gibbons said Pearce will undergo an MRI. ... C Russell Martin (left shoulder) played catch before the game. ... To make room for Sanchez, RHP Leonel Campos was optioned to Triple-A Buffalo.	UP NEXT	Mariners: Seattle returns home Monday to begin a three-game series against Oakland. RHP Yovani Gallardo (1-3, 4.58) starts the opener against Athletics LHP Sean Manaea (1-2, 5.18). Gallardo has finished at least five innings in all seven starts this season, but has yet to complete the seventh.	Blue Jays: RHP Mike Bolsinger (0-1, 3.18) starts the opener of a two-game series against Atlanta. Bolsinger allowed two runs in 5 2/3 innings against Cleveland in his first start of the season on May 9. RHP Bartolo Colon (1-4, 7.22) starts for the Braves.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

CLEVELAND -- Jason Kipnis batting at the top of the order seems like a good fit for the Cleveland Indians.	Kipnis, hitting leadoff for the first time this season, was 4 for 5 with two homers and four RBI, and the Indians woke up from an offensive slumber in an 8-3 victory over the Minnesota Twins on Sunday.	Carlos Santana and Lonnie Chisenhall also homered for Cleveland, which had scored one run in 24 innings going into the game.	Indians manager Terry Francona tinkered with the lineup after his team was held to three hits in each of the first two games of the series. While Francona says he doesn't have a crystal ball, the moves paid off.	"It's safe to say we were in need of a little shake-up," Kipnis said. "Over the last week we haven't been hitting the way any of us would like. We both felt it was the right time."	Kipnis, who had been batting sixth, homered off Hector Santiago (4-2) to start the game and hit a three-run homer in the third off Adam Wilk. The two-time All-Star missed most of spring training with a shoulder injury and wasn't activated until April 21.	"I kept saying that it's a matter of time, and it is, because he's too good. It was just nice to see," Francona said. "It kind of set the tone early."	Kipnis came in batting .155 with no homers and six RBI. He also singled in the second and eighth. Francona said before the game the move might jump-start his second baseman.	"I think he has a feel for when I'm coming around with my swing, just like I do," Kipnis said. "It's coming. Today was one of those ones where it all culminated and came together."	Trevor Bauer (3-4) allowed three runs in six-plus innings as the Indians broke a three-game losing streak.	Minnesota's four-game winning streak ended, but Jorge Polanco hit a solo homer in the seventh, giving the Twins a home run in 15 straight games, one short of the club record.	Santana, moved from leadoff to fifth, hit a solo homer in the third while Chisenhall, getting a rare start against a left-hander, added a two-run shot in the second.	Bauer blanked the Twins until the sixth, when Kennys Vargas hit a two-run double.	Santiago gave up six runs, including three homers, in a season-low 2 2/3 innings.	"I'll just wipe it off because it wasn't my best day," he said. "It was just a weird day. In the bullpen, I felt good. The first changeup to Kipnis kind of threw me off the rest of the way."	Daniel Robertson, whose contract was purchased from Triple-A Columbus, had an RBI single during Cleveland's three-run third.	GOOD RIDDANCE	Twins center fielder Byron Buxton crashed into the wall and robbed Santana of extra bases in the sixth. Buxton lost his cap and sunglasses when he hit the ground, but got to his feet and ran off the field.	Santana spiked his helmet into the ground after watching Buxton, who made several outstanding plays during the series.	"In the moment, I was a little mad, but this happens in the game," Santana said. "He's tough. I don't want him to be catching another, especially for me."	"I don't know how it gets much better than that," Twins manager Paul Molitor said. "He's not going to have fear. That's just the way he is."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: OF Brandon Guyer was placed on the 10-day disabled list with a sprained left wrist.	UP NEXT	Twins: RHP Phil Hughes opens a three-game series Tuesday against Colorado at Target Field.	Indians: RHP Carlos Carrasco seeks his first home victory of the season Monday against Tampa Bay.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

MIAMI -- Party music blared from the Miami Marlins' postgame clubhouse as Tyler Moore talked about his game-changing home run, which gave the team a victory to celebrate for the first time all week.	Moore connected for a pinch-hit three-run homer against R.A. Dickey in the seventh inning, and Miami broke a five-game losing streak by beating the Atlanta Braves 3-1 Sunday.	"It has been tough around here," Moore said. "It's good to see guys walking out of here with a smile."	The Marlins improved to 1-5 on their nine-game homestand, and 6-11 at home this year. Justin Nicolino, who pitched six innings in his first outing of the year, said the victory could lead to a turnaround for the Marlins, who climbed out of last place ahead of Atlanta in the NL East.	"When we're scuffling like this and we get a big win, momentum changes," Nicolino said. "Momentum is on our side, and we've got to keep going."	There was no sign of any change early on. Atlanta took a 1-0 lead in the fifth, and Miami had only three hits until the seventh, when Giancarlo Stanton led off with a double. With two out and runners on first and second, Moore sent Dickey's first pitch -- a high knuckleball with too much spin -- over the wall in left-center.	"He ambushed a tumbler," Dickey said.	Moore improved to 4 for 6 against Dickey with two homers, but said he doesn't enjoy at-bats against knuckleballers.	"They're usually not good," Moore said. "But this time it was good."	Moore has bounced between Miami and the minors this season. He improved to 4 for 10 as a pinch hitter and said he likes the role.	"I love being in the big leagues," he said. "Whatever is going to keep me here, I like."	His first homer of the year was his fourth career pinch-hit homer. Thanks to a strong effort by Nicolino and three relievers, it was all the offense Miami needed.	Nicolino, a left-hander recalled from Triple-A New Orleans before the game, allowed six hits and walked four walks. The Braves went 1 for 10 with runners in scoring position against him.	Miami left fielder Marcell Ozuna threw out Adonis Garcia trying to go from first to third on a single by Freddie Freeman in the seventh. Kyle Barraclough (1-0) then escaped a bases-loaded situation by retiring Kurt Suzuki.	A.J. Ramos pitched around a leadoff walk in the ninth for his fourth save.	"What you saw today is we got a good starting effort, a key hit and our bullpen pitching good," Miami manager Don Mattingly said. "Everything fell for us."	For the Braves, too much landed with a thud. They had eight hits and six walks but stranded 12 runners.	"We had opportunities with guys in the middle of the order," said Freeman, who had two hits but stranded five runners. "We just didn't get it done."	Miami hadn't faced a knuckleballer since 2015 and struggled against Dickey until he allowed his ninth homer this year. The loss snapped his eight-game winning streak against the Marlins.	Atlanta's Nick Markakis hit a two-out single in the fifth to drive home the game's first run. Teammate Matt Kemp went 0 for 4, ending his 13-game hitting streak.	BIG DP	Nicolino was called up to take injured left-hander Wei-Yin Chen's spot in the rotation. He escaped a first-inning jam when he got Markakis to hit into a 1-2-3 double play with the bases loaded.	"For me that just kind set the tone," Nicolino said.	ROSTER	To make room for Nicolino on the Miami roster, infielder Steve Lombardozzi was optioned to Triple-A New Orleans.	UP NEXT	Atlanta: RHP Bartolo Colon (1-4, 7.22 ERA) is scheduled to start Monday when the Braves play at Toronto to start a four-game, home-and-home series. Colon's ERA was the worst among qualified major league starters through Saturday.	Miami: RHP Dan Straily (1-3, 4.03 ERA) is scheduled to start Monday when the Marlins open a three-game series against Houston.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

BOSTON --  The Tampa Bay Rays spent their longest nine-inning game in team history playing in wind, rain and chilly temperatures in Fenway Park. It certainly felt a lot better coming away with a win.	Steven Souza Jr. hit a three-run homer, Jesus Sucre drove in three runs and the Rays beat the Boston Red Sox 11-2 on Sunday.	The Rays beat the Red Sox for the second time in three games -- and just the sixth time in the last 20 meetings -- a day after striking out 16 times in a loss.	"I didn't know that, but I'm excited," Rays manager Kevin Cash said when he found out that it was the club's longest game. "It's much better than losing the longest game in club history."	Evan Longoria and Sucre both had two singles, and Souza's homer came during a seven-run ninth as the Rays matched their season-high with 16 hits in a game that lasted 4 hours, 32 minutes.	Boston starter Drew Pomeranz (3-3) came out with left triceps tightness before the fourth inning. He gave up two runs and three hits while walking three and striking out three.	"He wasn't able to reproduce any symptoms later in the day," manager John Farrell said. "We'll see what transpires tomorrow. We don't think this is anything long term."	He's expected to get an MRI on Monday.	"I felt something in warmups kind of similar to what I felt in spring training," the left-hander said.	Xander Bogaerts had an RBI double for Boston after his 15-game hitting streak was halted Saturday.	Matt Andriese (3-1) gave up two runs in five innings.	Playing on a chilly, windy day with a drizzle falling on and off, both teams had trouble with pop ups -- one fell against each and Rays first baseman Logan Morrison snow-coned another -- and the outfielders looked like they were tip-toeing after balls on a muddy warning track.	"It was pretty ridiculous. I've never played in anything like this," Souza Jr. said. "We're all professionals. We've got to go out there and grind it out. We did a good job of not letting it get to us."	In the second, Tampa Bay made it 2-1 after Pomeranz walked the first two batters, prompting a visit Farrell. Kevin Kiermaier sacrificed before Sucre's sacrifice fly.	Sucre's RBI single increased it to 3-1 in the fourth following a wind-blown ground-rule double. Kiermaier's pop up fell between two fielders and bounced into the stands.	Longoria's RBI single made it 4-2. Sucre, Rickie Weeks Jr., Tim Beckham and Kiermaier each had an RBI single in the ninth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: DH Hanley Ramirez (strained muscle right shoulder) was back after missing three games. . LHP David Price, sidelined since early spring training with a strained left elbow, threw a simulated game after his rehab start with Triple-A Pawtucket was rained out. "We'll re-evaluate following Friday and wouldn't rule out his return to us if everything goes according to plan," Farrell said.	YOUR PRESENT, MOM	Andriese won on Mother's Day for the second straight year. He earned the win against the Angels last year with his mother, Lynn, watching him for the first time in the big leagues.	"She was pretty happy," Andriese said. "I got a text from her saying `Great win.' It's good to be 2-0 on Mother's Day."	SORRY MOMS	Due to the wet field, the Red Sox had to cancel the "running of the bases" that was scheduled for postgame.	ROSTER MOVE	Tampa Bay optioned Saturday's losing pitcher Blake Snell to Triple-A Durham and recalled RHP Ryne Stanek from the same team. Snell was 0-4 with a 4.71 ERA in eight starts.	Stanek made his major-league debut, getting one out and allowing a single.	UP NEXT	Rays: RHP Chris Archer (3-1, 3.04 ERA) is set to start Monday's opener of a three-game series at Cleveland against RHP Carlos Carrasco (4-2, 1.86). Archer is coming off eight shutout innings Wednesday, earning a win against Kansas City.	Red Sox: Off Monday before opening a two-game interleague series at St. Louis on Tuesday. LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (1-1, 2.80 ERA) is in line to start.

WASHINGTON --  After the Nationals' latest blown save, Washington manager Dusty Baker said he's open to a move to bolster his faltering bullpen.	He also knows he might have to wait a while.	Shawn Kelley struggled Sunday before Koda Glover allowed Ty Kelly's tiebreaking RBI single in Philadelphia's three-run ninth inning, sending the Nationals to a 4-3 loss to the Phillies in the opener of a day-night doubleheader.	"You're always pushing for a trade, but there ain't nobody trading right now," Baker said after his team suffered a third blown save in six games. "Sometimes you have no choice but to have patience. Nobody's going to drop you down a knockdown closer out of the sky until there's some teams out of it."	Aaron Altherr opened the ninth with his eighth homer. Maikel Franco and Cameron Rupp hit consecutive doubles off Kelley, and Freddy Galvis walked before Kelly's clutch swing lifted Philadelphia to its third win in 14 games.	"We've been in a hole, trying to climb out," Philadelphia manager Pete Mackanin said.	The Phillies also came back from three runs down to win in the teams' series finale last weekend in Philadelphia.	"That's how it's been against these guys all year," Altherr said of the Nationals relievers, who entered Sunday with a combined NL-worst 5.18 ERA. "We know their bullpen has been struggling a little bit. Never give up, never quit, keep fighting."	Kelley (3-1) blew his second save in five opportunities. The right-hander was activated from the disabled list Friday after being sidelined with a back strain and got the win with a scoreless inning in Saturday's 6-4 victory.	"I wasn't 100 percent," Kelley said of the quick turnaround. "But we don't always pitch 100 percent every time out. The bottom line is, in that situation, I want the ball there. And I've got to do my job, and I didn't."	Joaquin Benoit (1-2) pitched a scoreless eighth for Philadelphia, and Hector Neris finished for his fourth save.	Bryce Harper hit his 12th homer for NL East-leading Washington, and Trea Turner added a two-run shot.	Gio Gonzalez allowed one run and four hits in 6 2/3 innings, but saw a late lead disappear with the bullpen for the second time this season.	"This is just, `Turn the page, hey it happens, it's part of baseball," Gonzalez said of Kelley. "I know for a fact that he put his heart out there and he tried his best, you know."	Tommy Joseph hit an opposite-field homer off Gonzalez in the seventh, setting up Philadelphia's late rally.	TRAINERS ROOM	Phillies: INF Howie Kendrick (abdominal strain) is about to begin swinging the bat and will have at least one rehab game before returning, Mackanin said.	Nationals: LF Jayson Werth was out of the lineup for both games after leaving Saturday night's game because of groin tightness.	HOMER HAPPY	Harper has homered five times in eight games against the Phillies, even after missing an entire series with a groin injury.	SO IT'S BEEN A WHILE	Hellickson's fourth start against Washington in the season's 34th game is the earliest a Phillies starter has seen a team that many times since Jumbo Elliott faced the Brooklyn Dodgers for a fourth time in the 32nd game of the 1931 season.	UP NEXT	Phillies: Game 2 right-handed starter Vince Velazquez has a 6.88 ERA in six career starts vs. Washington, including an 8.18 ERA in two starts this season.	Nationals: Righty ace Max Scherzer aims for his 53rd career double-digit strikeout game -- and third straight -- to pass the Dodgers' Clayton Kershaw for the most among active players.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.	Jhoulys Chacín has agreed to a guaranteed $1.25 million, one-year contract with the Rockies.

NEW YORK -- The Yankees started celebrating even before ceremonies to retire Derek Jeter's No. 2.	Chase Headley stopped a 1-for-24 slide with a tiebreaking, bases-loaded triple off Chris Devenski in a six-run seventh inning, and New York rallied to beat the Houston Astros 11-6 Sunday in a doubleheader opener.	Looking pretty in pink in special Mother's Day uniforms, the AL East leaders stopped their first three-game losing streak since the season's opening week.	"It was pretty important, not only for myself but, obviously, for the team," said Headley, whose batting average had dropped from .304 on May 5 to .256.	Houston, a big league-best 25-12, had been trying to move 15 games over .500 for the first time since the Astros went 89-73 in 2005 and won their only NL pennant.	New York trailed 3-1 before Starlin Castro's tying, two-run homer off Mike Fiers in the fourth. Aaron Judge followed with his major league-leading 14th homer, a 441-foot drive off the padding above the center-field restaurant behind Monument Park, where a plaque honoring Jeter was to be unveiled during the ceremony before the night game.	The Yankees announced before the opener that closer Aroldis Chapman will be out at least a month because of a sore shoulder, forcing them to reshuffle their bullpen, and Houston took a 6-4 lead in the seventh against Adam Warren (1-0).	New York came right back in the bottom half when Matt Holliday hit a run-scoring infield single against Will Harris (1-1) and Castro tied the score with an opposite-field double to right off Devenski. Judge was intentionally walked, Didi Gregorius struck out on three pitches and Headley sent a hanging changeup rolling to the right-center.	"You just tell yourself to relax and try to take a deep breath and keep everything in perspective," Headley said. "When you haven't gotten a hit in a while, it feels like it's been five years since you've gotten a hit."	Chris Carter followed with an RBI double for a 10-6 lead. Brett Gardner added an eighth-inning homer off Tony Sipp.	Devenski leads big league relievers with 43 strikeouts. He had stranded all seven of his inherited runners this year and only three of 37 had scored in his big league career.	"Those definitely weren't my best changeups," Devenski said. "I didn't really execute well on that fastball to Castro."	Masahiro Tanaka (5-1) was to start the second game for the Yankees and Charlie Morton (4-2) for the Astros.	Only a few thousand fans were at Yankee Stadium for the start of an afternoon makeup of Saturday's rainout, and more rain fell during the Yankees' two rallies.	The Bleacher Creatures' first-inning Roll Call of Yankees starters included Jeter, who led New York to five World Series titles during a big league career that spanned 1995-2014, and fans chanted Jeter's name in the late innings.	Pitching on six days' rest, Yankees starter Luis Severino got just three outs with his first 44 pitches and was chased after 77 pitches and 2 1/3 innings. He gave up three runs, six hits and a season-high three walks.	"He just had to work really hard the first two innings, and it cost him," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.	Chad Green got Alex Bregman to ground into his second double play of the game and threw 3 2/3 innings of one-hit relief.	Fiers, who has allowed a big league-high 16 homers, gave up four runs and four hits in 5 2/3 innings.	Houston had gone ahead 6-4 in the seventh when Evan Gattis' second RBI single tied the score, and with runners at the corners and one out, Marwin Gonzalez hit a potential double-play grounder to Castro. The second baseman's back flip to Gregorius went into left field as the go-ahead run scored, and Yuli Gurriel followed with a sacrifice fly.	DRESS TO IMPRESS	Both teams wore special Mother's Day uniforms, undershirts and caps with pink elements, and many players used pink bats.	LONG BALLS	Judge has a big league-high six homers of 435 feet or more. He had gone six games and 27 at-bats since his previous home run on May 3.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: 1B Greg Bird, who hasn't played since May 1 because of a bone bruise in his right ankle, still has not been cleared to resume baseball activities.	UP NEXT	Astros: Joe Musgrove (2-3) starts Monday's series opener at Miami. Musgrove and Dallas Keuchel planned to fly ahead of the team Sunday evening.	Yankees: After an off day, CC Sabathia (2-2) starts Tuesday at Kansas City.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

CHICAGO --  San Diego Padres manager Andy Green said his team gave one away on Sunday. That was just fine with Todd Frazier and the Chicago White Sox.	Frazier's alert baserunning helped spark Chicago's eight-run eighth inning, sending the White Sox to a 9-3 win.	After pinch hitter Melky Cabrera's two-run single off Brandon Maurer gave the White Sox a 4-3 lead, Frazier tagged up on Tyler Saladino's popped-up bunt while first baseman Wil Myers held the ball in the infield with his back to home plate. When he finally caught on, Myers threw the ball to the backstop.	"It's just one of those things where you kind of read what's going on and you take a chance," Frazier said. "I thought it was a good chance to take. We scored two runs already with our closer coming in."	From San Diego's perspective, the play was emblematic of a comeback that should have been shut down before it happened.	"Those are painful losses," Green said. "Walks and defensive breakdowns. That's one of the ugliest half-innings I've ever seen in baseball; especially at the major league level. There's no excuse for so many things that happened that inning."	The collapse denied Jered Weaver his first win with the Padres after his best outing of the season.	Ryan Buchter (2-2) took the loss, walking three batters while recording only one out. Shortstop Luis Sardinas committed an error on a potential double-play ball that could have made it a scoreless inning for the Padres.	Instead, the White Sox sent 14 batters to the plate. Willy Garcia, Leury Garcia and Yolmer Sanchez each came up with big hits as the White Sox earned their second straight win after a six-game slide.	Weaver (0-4), a three-time All-Star in 11 seasons with the Angels, has struggled since signing with San Diego over the winter. But he pitched six innings of one-run ball against the White Sox.	The right-hander is 12-2 with a 1.87 ERA in 16 career starts against Chicago. His season ERA is now 6.05.	Jose Quintana was working on a shutout for the White Sox before he got into trouble in the seventh. Yangervis Solarte walked, Austin Hedges singled and Hunter Renfroe drove a high fastball just over the right-field fence for a 3-1 lead.	Quintana allowed five hits and walked four in seven innings. Michael Ynoa (1-0) earned the win with a scoreless eighth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: RHP Jarred Cosart (hamstring) was reinstated from the 10-day disabled list. Green said Cosart, who has made two starts this season, will work in long relief. San Diego optioned right-handed reliever Kevin Quackenbush to Triple-A El Paso. ... OF Allen Cordoba, who homered and recorded his first career three-hit game in Saturday's loss, was out of the lineup with a sore hamstring.	White Sox: RHP James Shields (right lat strain) said he will throw Monday in Anaheim for the first time since going on the 10-day disabled list on April 21. "They wanted to give me 12 to 15 days of no throwing and kind of just let this thing heal on its own," Shields said. "There's nothing you can really do about it but wait." Shields is 1-0 with a 1.62 ERA in three starts this season.	HELPING OUT	After the game, Frazier wondered if his heads-up play would give Saladino a sacrifice fly and an RBI, but it doesn't: A ball has to leave the infield for a sacrifice fly.	White Sox manager Rick Renteria praised Frazier for his hustle.	"That's instinct for him," Renteria said. "You always have to get ready for the next play and that's an example of it. I hope that's what we're talking about, but you have to give him a lot of credit."	ROSTER MOVE	The White Sox optioned infielder Cody Asche to Triple-A Charlotte after the game. Asche hit .105 with a homer and four RBI in 18 games with Chicago.	The team will make a corresponding move before Monday's game against the Los Angeles Angels.	UP NEXT	Padres: RHP Luis Perdomo (0-0, 4.13 ERA) opens a four-game home set against Milwaukee on Monday night.	White Sox: RHP Mike Pelfrey (0-3, 5.21 ERA) starts Monday night against the Los Angeles Angels in the opener of a 10-game trip.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MILWAUKEE --  Manny Pina slapped his right hand against his chest as he rounded the bases. He pointed into the stands as he headed to a dugout full of happy Milwaukee Brewers.	Somewhere among the delirious fans at Miller Park, his wife watched with pride. Pina's three-run homer with two outs in the bottom of the eighth inning capped the Brewers' comeback from a six-run deficit for an 11-9 win Sunday over the New York Mets.	Pina spoke to his mother in Venezuela by phone after the game. She screamed with joy.	"This is my (biggest) hit that I've hit in my career, so when I hit the ball -- wow, everything came into my mind, Mother's Day," Pina said.	The Brewers swept the three-game series. The struggling Mets have lost four straight, and their battered pitching staff took another demoralizing hit.	"We have a clubhouse full of veterans. They have all been through a game like this, they have all been through a series like this before," manager Terry Collins said. "You've got to rise out of the ashes and get back on the horse."	Pina hit a 3-2 slider from Addison Reed (0-2) over the wall in left. The Brewers scored 10 runs over their final three innings, teeing off on the Mets bullpen after a solid start by Jacob deGrom.	Third baseman Hernan Perez encouraged Pina before he came to the plate in the eighth after the catcher grounded out in the seventh with nobody out and runners on second and third, failing to drive in a run.	The frustrating at-bat weighed on Pina's mind. The emotions spilled out as he ran the bases.	"I was fighting every pitch, every pitch ... When I hit that ball, I knew that ball was gone, so that was amazing," a smiling Pina said.	Neftali Feliz (1-4) got the win despite allowing a run in eighth. Corey Knebel picked up his first save by pitching a scoreless ninth.	The Brewers moved to four games over .500 for the first time since Sept. 24, 2014.	METS MISERY	Michael Conforto finished a single short of the cycle and scored four runs. He and Neil Walker hit back-to-back, two-run doubles in the fifth to build a 7-1 lead before the Brewers tarted chipping away against the Mets bullpen.	Four New York relievers allowed seven runs on five hits and three walks.	DEGROM'S DAY	DeGrom allowed eight hits and four runs before being lifted in the seventh after allowing a leadoff single to Domingo Santana. The right-handed had an admirable afternoon for an injury-plagued pitching staff that lost closer Jeurys Familia and ace Noah Syndergaard this month to long-term injuries.	Starters Matt Harvey and Robert Gsellman have also struggled.	"The injuries are unfortunate. You can't help that. We got who we got here, and we got to do a better job. That is all there is to it," deGrom said.	BREWERS BITS	The Brewers had their biggest comeback since July 2, 2011, when the beat the Twins in Minnesota 8-7 after falling behind 7-0. ... Starter Wily Peralta struggled through 4 1/3 innings for Milwaukee, allowing seven hits and seven runs.	QUOTABLE	"I don't know if I've seen anything like that. We just kind of chipped away." -- Brewers manager Craig Counsell on the team's comeback.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: Collins said Asdrubal Cabrera's left thumb was "pretty sore" before Sunday's game, though the shortstop was available to pinch-hit with the aid of a brace. Jose Reyes played shortstop and led off with Cabrera out of the starting lineup. ... OF Jay Bruce got a day off.	Brewers: OF Ryan Braun (left calf) will travel with the team on the upcoming seven-game road trip to the Padres and Cubs. Braun is eligible to come off the 10-day disabled list during the Chicago series starting Friday. The Brewers expected Braun to have a short stay on the DL. ... 3B Travis Shaw left the game after the bottom of the sixth after hurting his right index finger. He appeared to jam the finger while trying to make a play on Reyes' infield single in the top of the sixth.	UP NEXT	Mets: RHP Zack Wheeler (2-2) opens a three-game series Monday in Arizona against the Diamondbacks. Wheeler is 1-0 with a 3.48 ERA in two road starts this season.	Brewers: RHP Chase Anderson (2-0) takes the mound to start the four-game series in San Diego. Anderson, who used to pitch in the NL West with Arizona, is 3-1 with a 3.60 ERA in six career starts against San Diego.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Mike Moustakas came through with a big homer and thought of his late mother, just like he does every time he goes deep.	Moustakas homered and drove in four runs to help the Kansas City Royals rally from five runs down to beat the Baltimore Orioles 9-8 Sunday.	"A day like today makes me miss my mom even more," Moustakas said of his mother Connie, who passed way on Aug. 9, 2015. "Mother's Day is special, but I miss my mom every day. It doesn't take a day like today to miss her.	"Anytime I hit a home run, I think about my mom and always point up to her. In order to do that, is a pretty cool feeling. Today was no different, just a tie game and thinking about my mom pretty much all the time, so nothing really changes."	Jorge Soler and Drew Butera also homered for the Royals. Soler's 464-foot shot to center leading off the seventh was the longest by a Kansas City player this season.	The Royals have won four straight, matching a season high, and six of seven since moving Alcides Escobar to the leadoff spot.	Moustakas homered off Kevin Gausman with Butera and Escobar aboard in a five-run fourth when the Royals sent 11 men to the plate. Gausman was pulled after retiring only 10 of the 21 batters he faced, allowing five runs and nine hits with two walks.	"It's frustrating," Gausman said. "I think they started eliminating my curveball early in the game, when I get in those situations where I have to throw a strike, the hitters pretty much have a good idea what they're going to get. And that's the biggest thing. They didn't really miss any pitches that were in the strike zone and even some pitches that were out of the strike zone, they went out there and got it."	The Royals scored two runs, one unearned, in the fifth, which included Alex Gordon scoring from second on Manny Machado's throwing error after Escobar's bunt.	The Orioles jumped on Royals starter Chris Young for five runs in 3 2/3 innings. Young gave up home run to Chris Davis to leadoff the second and a two-run shot in a four-run fourth to Caleb Joseph to finish his day. Ryan Flaherty contributed a two-run double in the fourth.	"The ones that really hurt were the Flaherty and the Joseph, back-to-back," Young said. "Sliders I didn't execute. If I make a good pitch to Flaherty, I'd like to think I'd get an out there and keep me at 1-nothing at that point and this win is a lot easier. I didn't execute and it cost us."	In two starts this season and 13 starts last year, Young is 1-8 with an 8.74 ERA, allowing 55 runs on 80 hits, including 29 home runs, in 56 2/3 innings.	Davis reached base five times on his homer, RBI single and three walks.	Matt Strahm (1-2), the second of seven Royals pitchers, picked up the victory. Kelvin Herrera, pitching in three consecutive days, finished up for his eighth save in nine chances. After Joseph's RBI double in the ninth, Herrera struck out Seth Smith and got Jonathan Schoop on a fly ball to strand runners at second and third to end the game.	Richard Bleier (0-1) took the loss as the Baltimore bullpen gave up four runs.	"For the most part our guys have done a tremendous job of holding it there and kind of stopping the bleeding," Joseph said. "We just weren't able to bandage it up today."	The nine runs and 14 hits were season-highs for the Royals.	SORIA'S AMAZING CATCH	Joakim Soria came sprinting off the mound to catch Mark Trumbo's foul pop up that catcher Butera lost in the sun. "He keeps telling me he wants to catch pop ups and I told him, here's your chance," Butera said. "I gave it to him. I thought it was a foul ball straight back and I didn't see it. The next thing I see Jack running by and said, `Thank God, he's athletic."	ORIOLES RECALL BLEIR	The Orioles recalled Bleier from Triple-A Norfolk, where he had a 0.61 ERA, allowing one run in 14 2/3 innings with 15 strikeouts and no walks. Bleier had a 1.96 ERA in 23 relief appearances last season for the Yankees. The Orioles optioned LHP Vidal Nuno, who had a 6.75 ERA in nine bullpen outings, to the Tide.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: CF Adam Jones was not in the lineup for the first time this season. "He's pretty banged up," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. "He's got a sore hip.  He's diving, different stuff." With a day off Monday, this will give Jones two days to rest.	Royals: LF Alex Gordon, who left the game Friday with right groin tightness and sat out Saturday, was back in the Royals' lineup. Gordon went 0 for 4, dropping his average to .153.	UP NEXT	Orioles: LHP Wade Miley will start the series opener Tuesday at Detroit after a day off Monday.	Royals: RHP Jason Hammel, who allowed a career-matching 13 hits in his previous start, draws the starting assignment Tuesday against the Yankees.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ST. LOUIS --  St. Louis infielder Matt Carpenter finally got the best of close friend Jake Arrieta.	But he isn't going to brag about it.	Carpenter slammed a two-run homer, Yadier Molina homered twice and Adam Wainwright threw seven shutout innings to lead the Cardinals to a 5-0 win over the Chicago Cubs on Sunday.	Randal Grichuk added three hits for St. Louis, which won for the eighth time in nine games. Chicago has lost three of four.	Carpenter entered his third-inning at-bat with a 1-for-31 career slate against Arrieta. The two were college teammates at TCU. Carpenter served as a groomsman at Arrieta's wedding.	"It was great to get out there and finally have some success against him," Carpenter said. "He's given me a hard time over the years, we jab back-and-forth but, I won't rub that kind of stuff in."	Arrieta (4-3) realized that his success against Carpenter was not going to last forever.	"A hitter like that, regardless of the history -- you make a mistake and they're going to make you pay for it," Arrieta said.	Carpenter came into the game 0 for 27 against Arrieta in the regular season and 1 for 3 in the post season. He grounded back to the mound in his first trip to the plate.	"I always kid him that I'm a .300 hitter against him in the post-season," Carpenter said.	Molina recorded the third multi-homer game of his career. His last came on Aug. 21, 2011 at Wrigley Field. He drilled a two-run homer off Arrieta in the second inning.	Swinging a pink bat in honor of mother's day, Molina added a solo blast off Brian Duensing in the eighth. Molina pointed to his mother, Gladys, in the stands as he headed into the dugout.	"It's special, every time you have your family and your mama here," Molina said. "I got lucky and put a good swing on it."	Wainwright (3-3) allowed four hits in a 102-pitch stint. He struck out three and walked four. Wainwright had given up four earned run in each of his last three starts.	"It's a good outing to build off," Wainwright said. "I can still get better. I can still have better fastball command. It's certainly a stepping stone."	Trevor Rosenthal and Kevin Siegrist each pitched a perfect inning to complete the four-hitter.	Chicago had runners on in six of the first seven innings.	"Overall, we're not doing a good job with runners in scoring position," Chicago manager Joe Maddon said.	MOTHER'S DAY MANIA	A crowd of 47,925 attended the contest, the largest crowd in the history of Busch Stadium III. The three-game series drew 143,408.	MAGIC NUMBER ON HOLD	Maddon has 999 career wins in stints with Anaheim, Tampa Bay and Chicago. He is looking to become the eighth active manager to hit the 1,000-win plateau.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs:  INF Kris Bryant missed his third successive game with the stomach flu. INF Addison Russell returned to the starting lineup after missing three starts with a right shoulder ailment.	Cardinals: LHP Tyler Lyons was sent to Single-A Peoria on a 30-day rehabilitation assignment. He is out with a right muscle strain.	UP NEXT	Cubs: RHP John Lackey (3-3, 4.29) opens up a three-game series against Cincinnati on Tuesday in the first game of a 10-game homestand. RHP Bronson Arroyo (3-2, 5.94) will start for the Reds.	Cardinals: RHP Lance Lynn (4-1, 2.75) takes on Boston LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (1-1, 2.80) in the first of a two-game series on Tuesday.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  A sweeping comeback for the Texas Rangers, who suddenly have the longest winning streak in the major leagues.	Nomar Mazara had the tiebreaking RBI single, the second game in a row he had the go-ahead hit in the seventh inning, and the Rangers wrapped up a week filled with comebacks in a 6-4 win over Oakland on Sunday.	"We're seeing some results now," Mazara said after the three-game sweep of the Athletics that gave the Rangers six wins in a row.	"We believe everything is back on track," shortstop Elvis Andrus said. "We knew as a team we weren't playing the way we know how we know we can play."	Mazara's two-out single that made it 5-4 came right after Andrus' tying RBI double, both off reliever Ryan Madson (0-3).	Since coming home after an 11-0 win at San Diego last Tuesday, the Rangers have come from behind to win their last five games. That included game-ending three-run homers Thursday and Friday before Andrus and Mazara had consecutive two-RBI hits in the seventh inning Saturday night against the A's.	"Anytime you put wins together, there's a lot of momentum. There's a lot of feel-good," manager Jeff Banister said. "We knew that this offense would get going at some point."	Carlos Gomez had three hits, including a single to start the seventh, but left the game with a right hamstring strain after scoring from second base on Delino DeShields' two-out infield single that chased Oakland starter Kendall Graveman.	DeShields hit a slicing chopper that third baseman Trevor Plouffe fielded near the line with Gomez running in front of him. The speedy DeShields beat the throw to first, and Gomez kept running and scored when he lunged toward the plate while also avoiding a bat still on the ground.	"I was going full speed and I didn't want to try to slide because I thought I could get hurt and I accelerated again," said Gomez, who will have an MRI on Monday, an off day at home for the Rangers.	Dario Alvarez (2-0) got the final outs of the seventh for the Rangers. Sam Dyson pitched the eighth before Matt Bush worked the ninth for his fourth save in five chances.	Plouffe, Adam Rosales and Matt Joyce all homered for the A's, who have gone deep 16 times their last eight games.	Joyce hit a two-run homer in the fifth off Rangers starter A.J. Griffin for a 4-2 lead. That came after Rosales led off with a shot that just cleared the 14-foot wall in left field and Rajai Davis then doubled.	"It's frustrating that for roughly two-thirds of the game we had the upper hand on it and then we lose it," A's manager Bob Melvin said. "We feel good about all our guys in our bullpen. Kendall pitched for us today, it just got away from us again at the end."	NOT ANOTHER NO-NO BID	The Rangers were held hitless by Graveman on April 8 until Mike Napoli's homer with two outs in the seventh inning. This time, DeShields, Andrus and Mazara had consecutive singles to start the first, when Texas quickly went ahead 2-0. "The good news for me is bounce back after the first," Graveman said. "I didn't lose my composure."	LESS SUPPORT	Rangers starter A.J. Griffin trailed 4-2 when he left the game in the sixth, after allowing all three homers. He was coming off a four-hit shutout in his hometown of San Diego in his last start, the first win in the Rangers streak. This was the first time in Griffin's six starts this season that he got fewer than five runs from the offense while pitching.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: Melvin said RHP Daniel Mengden, out all season recovering from right foot surgery, is getting the kinks out but has good velocity and feels good in his rehab assignment with Triple-A Nashville. ... RHP John Axford (strained right shoulder) is expected to get at least one more rehab appearance. He could rejoin the A's sometime soon after they get home Thursday.	Rangers: RF/DH Shin-Soo Choo had spasms in his lower back and was scratched from the lineup.	UP NEXT	Athletics: Sean Manaea (1-2) is set to come off the disabled list to start Monday night at Seattle.	Rangers: After a day off Monday, the Rangers open a three-game series at home Tuesday with Yu Darvish (3-2) facing the Philadelphia Phillies.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

DENVER -- Colorado's Antonio Senzatela emphatically pointed to the sky as he closed out the fifth inning on Sunday.	It had been an emotional Mother's Day for the 22-year-old rookie.	Pat Valaika homered twice and drove in four runs, Senzatela got the win and the Rockies beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 9-6.	Senzatela (6-1) was pitching on Mother's Day for the first time since his mom died of breast cancer last July. Like many around the league, Senzatela used a pink bat to raise awareness about the disease. He also wrote his mother's name, "Nidya," on his pink and white cleats.	"I feel good," Senzatela said. "Too many emotions in my heart now."	The rookie right-hander is tied for the majors' lead in wins. He allowed four runs in five innings, his shortest outing since his first career start at Milwaukee on April 6.	Nolan Arenado also went deep as the Rockies hit their first homers of the series to salvage a four-game split. Their lead in the NL West is back up to 1 1/2 games.	Los Angeles led 4-3 before Valaika hit a two-run homer in the fourth off starter Julio Urias (0-1). Arenado, who also had an RBI double, added to Colorado's lead in the fifth with a two-run shot off veteran reliever Sergio Romo.	Justin Turner and Cody Bellinger each drove in a run in the eighth to cut the lead to 7-6 before Valaika hit another two-run blast.	The 24-year-old Valaika has seen an increase in playing time since Trevor Story went on the disabled list with a shoulder injury earlier in the week.	Greg Holland struck out the side in the ninth for his majors' best 16th save. Holland has converted his first 16 save opportunities for the Rockies, a franchise-best mark to start a season.	Senzatela dealt with traffic on base in every inning except the fourth, but got help from his defense to limit the damage. He gave up seven hits, three walks and two homers while striking out five.	The 22-year-old got out of the first with runners on the corners thanks to a fielder's choice double play, and he was bailed out of the third by second baseman DJ LeMahieu, who laid out on a sharp grounder and threw out Chase Utley at first to save a run.	With two outs in the fifth, Senzatela was struck in the back of the leg by a liner from Yasmani Grandal. He stayed in the game and forced a flyout to end the inning.	"Without having his best control and command, he was able to navigate through a really good lineup," Colorado manager Bud Black said.	Corey Seager and Yasiel Puig homered for the Dodgers, who couldn't protect two early leads. Seager hit a two-run blast in the first and Puig hit a laser to left in the second.	"Today's one of those days we had a lot of situational opportunities and didn't capitalize," Los Angeles manager Dave Roberts said. "Obviously a good club like that, you keep them in a ball game, they're going to crawl back."	ROUGH OUTING	Urias allowed six runs and seven hits in four innings for the Dodgers. The left-handed pitcher had allowed one hit in 6 1/3 innings in his last start against the Pittsburgh Pirates on Tuesday.	He had a 1.06 ERA in his first three starts of the year.	"I felt good," he said. "Unfortunately it was just a bad outing."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: 2B Logan Forsythe, sidelined since April 19 with a fractured right toe, is expected to start in a rehabilitation game as a designated hitter on Tuesday. ... LHP Rich Hill, who's been limited to just eight innings this season because of blisters on his throwing hand, will start Tuesday against the San Francisco Giants.	Rockies: C Tony Wolters, who was put on the 7-day DL with a concussion on May 3, was behind the plate for Triple-A Albuquerque on Sunday. "I talked to (Isotopes manager) Glenallen Hill this morning about a number of things and he said Tony looked good the last couple days, both behind the plate and at the plate," Black said. "So Tony's in a good spot."	UP NEXT	Dodgers: RHP Brandon McCarthy (3-0, 3.10 ERA) will make his first start since he was placed on the 10-day DL, retroactive to May 5, with an injury to his non-throwing shoulder. San Francisco's Matt Cain will oppose him as the Dodgers begin a three-game set at AT&T Park on Monday.	Rockies: Rookie LHP Kyle Freeland (3-2, 2.93) will pitch at an American League ballpark for the first time in his career as the Rockies open up a three-game set against the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday. In his last start, the Denver native tossed six innings and gave up five runs -- all in the second inning -- in an 8-1 loss to the Chicago Cubs on Tuesday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Six years after Alex Meyer was a first-round draft pick, the 6-foot-9 right-hander is still trying to realize his enormous potential as a big league pitcher.	Meyer appears to be on his way after outpitching Justin Verlander in the longest and best start of his career for the Los Angeles Angels.	Mike Trout homered in his third straight game and Meyer pitched three-hit ball into the seventh inning of the Angels' 4-1 victory over the Detroit Tigers on Sunday.	Meyer (2-1) is attempting to secure his spot in Los Angeles' rotation after two stints in Triple-A this season. His fourth start of the season was largely outstanding, and he picked up his third career win when his teammates got to Verlander for two solo homers.	"I don't want to get comfortable with anything," Meyer said. "It's tough up here. It's not easy, and I've got to remember that, which I will. It was a good stepping stone today, and hopefully I'll build off it and get better."	After giving up two hits and his only run in his first five pitches, Meyer limited the Tigers to two walks and recorded a career-high seven strikeouts. The Angels are Meyer's third big league organization, and he has his best chance yet to stick in the big show after back-to-back victories.	"The whole thing you'd like to see in the game plan, he accomplished it," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.	Danny Espinosa hit a tiebreaking homer off Verlander, helping the Angels to just their fourth win in 12 games.	Andrelton Simmons added an RBI single to chase Verlander (3-3) in the seventh as the Angels split four games with the Tigers, who haven't won a series in Anaheim in eight tries since 2009.	Ian Kinsler doubled and scored on Nicholas Castellanos' single to put the Tigers up early, but they didn't score again.	"We just didn't muster up anything offensively," Detroit manager Brad Ausmus said. "It was a different day, for sure. ... This team is going to hit. It's not something I'm going to worry about."	Bud Norris pitched the ninth for his seventh save in nine chances.	VERLANDER VS. TROUT	Verlander yielded five hits and walked five while pitching into the seventh inning of his first loss in four starts. With seven strikeouts, Verlander passed Tommy John and pulled even with Eddie Plank for 53rd place in baseball history with 2,246 career strikeouts.	But he regretted his hanging slider to Trout in the first inning to give away his early lead. Trout also was hit by a pitch and drew a walk from Verlander.	"In two at-bats, I didn't give him anything to hit," Verlander said. "The one pitch I did give him to hit was a cookie. So it's tough facing him, obviously."	TROUT'S CLOUTS	With his 11th homer, Trout went deep in three straight games for the third time in his career, also accomplishing the feat in September 2013 and June 2016. The two-time AL MVP also stole two bases, joining Alex Rodriguez as the only players to get 175 homers and 150 steals before their age-26 season.	Trout reached base three times before driving in another run with a sacrifice fly in the seventh.	DANNY'S DINGER	Espinosa was mired in a 3-for-57 slump before cranking a 433-foot shot to right in the fourth. The power-hitting second baseman hadn't homered since April 13, and the hit was just his second since April 26.	BIG SWIPES	Cameron Maybin stole second base three times for the Angels, matching his career high in steals. He also became the first player in franchise history to get three walks and three steals in the same game.	Along with Trout's steals, Los Angeles had two players with two stolen bases apiece for the first time since July 30, 2011, at Detroit.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: 3B Yunel Escobar had an MRI exam on his hamstring and was diagnosed with a Grade 1 strain, sending him to the disabled list and likely sidelining him for two to four weeks.	UP NEXT	Tigers: Matthew Boyd (2-3, 3.89 ERA) makes his eighth start of the year when Detroit returns home to face Baltimore. Boyd has never faced the Orioles or beaten an AL East team.	Angels: Jesse Chavez (2-5, 4.29 ERA) takes the mound when the Chicago White Sox visit Anaheim to open a three-game set. Los Angeles' preseason fifth starter isn't getting great results, but is eating up innings for an injury-plagued staff.	---	More AP MLB: www.apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Brandon Belt thinks the San Francisco Giants poor start is over. Putting up offensive numbers and getting on a winning streak can do wonders for self-assurance.	Belt homered again and the Giants posted their first three-game winning streak of the season, beating the Cincinnati Reds 8-3 on Sunday.	San Francisco has climbed out of the NL West basement, although its 15-24 record is still nine games back of Colorado for the division lead.	"We knew we were a better team than that," Belt said. "Now with some of our guys back in the lineup I think everybody feels a little more confident taking the field each day."	Belt hit his third home run in four games. Joe Panik and Eduardo Nunez each drove in two runs and Buster Posey had two hits for the Giants.	"It's been a while since we've had a cushion like that," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "It was nice to get an early lead, add on and add on again. It allows you to work the pitching a little different and give some guys a needed day off."	Scooter Gennett drove in two runs for the Reds, who lost their third straight.	Jeff Samardzija (1-5) snapped a personal six-game losing streak dating to last season. He gave up three runs in 6 2/3 innings, striking out eight and walking none.	"When the guys swing it like that and play the defense that they played out there, it makes the game a whole lot of fun," Samardzija said. "It's one of those days you can actually enjoy."	Reds starter Tim Adleman (2-2) gave up four runs and was taken out after the first inning because of a neck strain.	"It came to light while the damage was being done," Reds manager Bryan Price said. "He was able to finish the inning, but it was unrealistic for him to go back out."	Barrett Astin replaced Adleman and gave up three runs in the second.	Panik hit an RBI double, Posey singled home a run and Nunez added a two-run single in the first.	Crawford drove in two runs and Panik drove in another in the second inning. Belt homered in the sixth.	Samardzija breezed through four innings before giving up Gennett's two-run single in the fifth. He avoided further damage until Jose Peraza tripled and scored on pinch hitter Tucker Barnhart's sacrifice fly in the seventh.	Billy Hamilton and Joey Votto each had two hits for the Reds.	A LITTLE MOTIVATION	The Giants were outscored 31-5 in being swept by the Reds at Cincinnati last week. That proved to be inspirational.	"We got pummeled pretty good, to the point where that's embarrassing," Bochy said. "We come here, they win the first ballgame so they've won four in a row now and had a lot of success against us. To bounce back and win three games in a row and pitch the way we did and really execute and win the way we did today ... it was a good bounce back."	Said Samardzija: "Everybody takes losses here pretty personally. You don't want it to be that ugly, but you find a way to protect your team and get through those games healthy and be ready to go the next day."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: INF Zack Cozart was held out of Sunday's game with a wrist problem as a precaution.	Giants: OF Hunter Pence could be headed for the DL after an MRI revealed a minor hamstring strain on his left side. "It looks like it's going to be a few days. He's available to pinch hit," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "We just have to make the call whether we're going to be able to afford to use him strictly off the bench or get a healthy body up here to help out in the outfield." ... RHP Mark Melancon is scheduled for a bullpen session on Monday. He could return to action soon after.	UP NEXT	Reds: Following a day off Monday, RHP Bronson Arroyo (3-2, 5.94) opens a three-game series at the Chicago Cubs on Tuesday.	Giants: RHP Matt Cain (2-1, 4.54) starts Monday night's series opener against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He beat them in his last start, also at home, on April 24.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

PHOENIX --  Jose Osuna was the last player cut from spring training for the Pittsburgh Pirates. He made it back to the big club, though, and now he's proving his worth.	Osuna hit a two-run homer with two outs in the 10th inning and Tony Watson escaped a bases-loaded jam in the bottom of the inning to lift the Pirates over the Arizona Diamondbacks 6-4 on Sunday.	Osuna hit a 3-1 pitch from Tom Wilhelmsen (0-1) out to center field, forcing a split of a four-game series.	"From the first moment, I knew it was gone," Osuna said.	It was the 24-year-old Osuna's second career homer and came after he'd been hitless in 12 straight at-bats.	"Continues to work hard to acclimate to the speed of the game up here," Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said. "He's a mature hitter. We like the battle in the box, we like the grit, we like the man."	Watson (2-0) pitched two scoreless innings to earn the win. He got Jake Lamb out on a ground ball to second with the bases loaded to end the game.	The Diamondbacks put runners on the corners with one out in the 10th after A.J. Pollock singled, but Pollock injured his right groin running up the baseline and had to come out of the game.	Starting pitcher Zack Greinke entered as a pinch runner and another starter, Patrick Corbin, struck out as a pinch hitter in the inning. Slugger Paul Goldschmidt was intentionally walked before Lamb grounded out.	"We had a meeting four days ago, and I said `Goldschmidt wasn't going to beat us," Hurdle said.	He almost did. Goldschmidt homered twice against Ivan Nova and leads the Diamondbacks with 32 RBI. He homered in consecutive games for the third time this season.	Josh Bell and Andrew McCutchen hit home runs during a three-run third inning for the Pirates, who gave up a 4-2 lead.	Bell went opposite field to right for his team-leading seventh home run of the season. McCutchen led off the inning with a solo shot, his sixth of the year and fifth on the road.	Nova pitched six innings and allowed three runs and nine hits, including Goldschmidt's homers.	Diamondbacks starter Robbie Ray lasted only four innings, during which he allowed four runs, walked three and hit a batter.	Pirates reliever Daniel Hudson walked the bases loaded in the eighth, then gave way to Wade LeBlanc, who walked pinch hitter Jeff Mathis to tie it at 4. LeBlanc struck out Goldschmidt to the end the inning.	"They made some good pitches, especially with the bases loaded. It would have been nice to come through but he got me looking," Goldschmidt said.	Wilhelmsen walked Gift Ngoepe before Osuna's homer.	Adam Frazier had three hits for Pittsburgh in his third game since coming off the disabled list. Lamb had three hits for Arizona, which has lost two straight.	GARDENHIRE RETURNS	Diamondbacks bench coach Ron Gardenhire returned to the team Sunday. Gardenhire, the former Minnesota Twins manager, had prostate surgery on April 18 after he was diagnosed with cancer during spring training.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: Gregory Polanco appeared to pull up running out a ground ball in the fifth inning and was replaced by John Jaso in right field in the bottom of the inning. Polanco left with discomfort in his left hamstring, but said after the game that he thinks it isn't too serious and that he left for more of a precautionary reason.	Diamondbacks: Pollock could miss some time with his injury. "I hit the ball, ran, felt a little grab," Pollock said. "It wasn't good, but we will see." ... After a workout and further evaluation before Sunday's game, C Chris Iannetta was placed on the 7-day concussion disabled list, retroactive to May 13. He was hit in the face with a pitch from the Pirates' Johnny Barbato on Friday night. Iannetta suffered a split lip, cracked teeth and broken nose. ... The Diamondbacks recalled RHP Silvino Bracho from Triple-A Reno to fill the open roster spot. ... David Peralta left the game after striking out in the seventh with tightness in his right glute, but said he might be able to play as soon as Monday.	UP NEXT	Pirates: After a day off Monday, the Pirates are home to start a three-game series against Washington on Tuesday with RHP Chad Kuhl on the mound. Kuhl (1-3) has one career start against the Nationals, when he gave up one hit in six innings last July.	Diamondbacks: RHP Zack Godley makes his third start of the season when Arizona opens a three-game series against the New York Mets at home. Godley (1-0, 2.25 ERA) is still trying to lock down the No. 5 spot in Arizona's starting rotation.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

WASHINGTON --  After two games, 6 1/2 hours of play and two blown saves, the Washington Nationals emerged from a day-night doubleheader with a hard-earned split and -- more importantly -- ace Max Scherzer's left knee OK to pitch.	Scherzer endured a scary line drive to grind out six innings, Michael Taylor hit a go-ahead two-run homer in the eighth and Washington overcame another dodgy bullpen outing to earn a 6-5 win in Game 2 over the Philadelphia Phillies on Sunday night.	"I went into this game with a little blister on my finger," said Scherzer, the defending NL Cy Young Award winner. "Obviously after I got hit, my blister hurt less. So that was the good news."	Bryce Harper went 3 for 4, doubled and drove in two runs in Game 2. He also belted his 12th home run in Game 1, but Philadelphia won 4-3 after Washington's third blown save in six games.	The Nationals blew another one later Sunday when Freddy Galvis' two-run triple off Jacob Turner (2-1) put the Phillies ahead 5-4 in the eighth.	After striking out three times, Taylor homered off Pat Neshek (0-1), belting a first-pitch slider off the left field foul pole. The runs were Neshek's first allowed this season.	"Oh man, I was just hoping that it hit the foul pole," said manager Dusty Baker of the homer that sealed a series victory for the first-place Nationals. "You don't get another chance at that pitch."	Said Neshek: "Terrible pitch. He was looking for it."	Matt Albers worked the ninth in Game 2 for his second save after Shawn Kelley blew a save in Game 1. Ty Kelly had a tiebreaking single during a three-run ninth in the day game.	Scherzer was drilled in his left knee by Michael Saunders' shot in the fourth inning and went tumbling. After briefly climbing to his feet before returning to the ground, he was still grimacing several minutes later while being examined by a Nationals medical staff member.	"Once I was able to get back onto it and walk on it for a second, I knew it wasn't broken," Scherzer said. "And then obviously the pain was pretty intense, but I just needed to catch my breath."	He eventually got to his feet, threw three warmup pitches and gave a thumbs-up sign, sending Baker back to the dugout.	Scherzer allowed two runs in the fourth and another in the sixth but escaped further damage when Brock Stassi was tagged out at home trying to score after misreading an infield single.	A CALL FOR HELP	After watching his bullpen blow a two-run lead in the early game, Baker said he's open to getting outside help.	"You're always pushing for a trade, but there ain't nobody trading right now," Baker said. "Sometimes you have no choice but to have patience. Nobody's going to drop you down a knockdown closer out of the sky until there's some teams out of it."	In Game 1, Aaron Altherr opened the ninth with his eighth homer. Maikel Franco and Cameron Rupp hit consecutive doubles off Kelley (3-1), and Galvis walked before Kelly's clutch swing lifted Philadelphia to its third win in 14 games.	"That's how it's been against these guys all year," Altherr said of the Nationals relievers, who entered Sunday with a combined NL-worst 5.18 ERA. "We know their bullpen has been struggling a little bit."	Joaquin Benoit (1-2) pitched a scoreless eighth for Philadelphia, and Hector Neris finished for his fourth save.	HOMER HAPPY	Harper has homered five times in nine games against the Phillies, even after missing an entire series with a groin injury.	FINALLY GOT HIM	Altherr was 7 for his last 16 with five home runs entering Sunday night's game, in which he went 0 for 4 and got hit by Scherzer in the fourth.	IT'S BEEN A WHILE	Jeremy Hellickson made his fourth start of the season against Washington in Game 1, in and Philadelphia's 34th game. That's the earliest a Phillies starter has seen a team that many times since Jumbo Elliott faced the Brooklyn Dodgers a fourth time in the 32nd game of the 1931 season.	TRAINERS ROOM	Phillies: INF Howie Kendrick (abdominal strain) is about to begin swinging the bat and will have at least one rehab game before returning, manager Pete Mackanin said.	Nationals: LF Jayson Werth was out of the lineup for both games after leaving Saturday night's game because of groin tightness. Baker said he'll be re-evaluated Monday.	UP NEXT	Phillies: RHP Jerad Eickhoff (0-3, 4.76) starts the opener of Philadelphia's first interleague series Tuesday, a three-game set in Texas.	Nationals: RHP Stephen Strasburg looks to improve upon his 3-2 record and 2.51 ERA against the Pirates in a series opener in Pittsburgh Tuesday.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

NEW YORK --  Proudly wearing No. 2 in tribute to Derek Jeter, Alex Bregman drove a splitter into the left-field seats, capping a six-run first inning off Masahiro Tanaka with his first home run this season and first big league grand slam.	As he rounded third base on Mother's Day, he pointed toward his mom Jackie in the stands. She was raised on Long Island in East Islip, rooted for the Yankees and named the family's dog, a Labrador Retriever, after Jeter.	"Guess it was the No. 2 magic tonight," Bregman said with a grin. "My mom grew up the biggest Jeter fan ever."	George Springer led off the game with a drive into Monument Park just after Jeter's number was retired there in a pregame ceremony. Josh Reddick homered off the facing of the right-field second deck on the next pitch , and Springer also homered leading off the second. The Houston Astros built a nine-run lead and held on for a 10-7 win over New York and a doubleheader split Sunday.	"It was always kind of our dream to be able to play here and play in the big leagues and playing in her home city," Bregman said. "Watching her favorite team, watching her favorite player get his jersey retired was a pretty special moment."	Bregman homered just as Jeter was holding a news conference under the stands following the between-games ceremony, which came after the Yankees rallied for an 11-6 win in the opener. The 23-year-old third baseman, who made his big league debut last year, viewed the tribute from Houston's dugout.	"You get chills watching some of those moments: the flip, the home runs, the jump throws in the hole," said Bregman, whose only disappointment was he did not get to meet Jeter.	Houston gave Bregman the silent treatment when he reached the dugout. The Astros, a big league-best 26-12, chased Tanaka when Carlos Beltran added an RBI double with two outs in the second.	Tanaka (5-2) left to jeers with New York trailing 8-0, the most runs he allowed in his major league career. The homers tied his high.	"I didn't get my job done, so they have all the right to boo me," Tanaka said through a translator.	Backed by a 9-0 lead, Charlie Morton (5-2) gave up four runs in 5 2/3 innings, including Matt Holliday's three-run homer in a four-run fifth. Morton had 10 of the 16 strikeouts by Astros pitchers, including seven in a row, as Houston took three of four in the series. Astros closer Ken Giles got the final out in a three-run ninth, retiring Aaron Hicks on a comebacker with two on.	New York announced before the opener that closer Aroldis Chapman will be out at least a month because of left shoulder inflammation. The Yankees then rebounded from Luis Severino's poor start to stop their three-game slide and the Astros' five-game winning streak. Chase Headley, in a 1-for-24 funk, hit a tiebreaking, bases-loaded triple off Chris Devenski in a six-run seventh inning that overcame a 6-4 deficit.	"It was pretty important, not only for myself but, obviously, for the team," said Headley, whose batting average had dropped from .304 on May 5 to .256.	Looking pretty in pink in special Mother's Day uniforms, the AL East leaders trailed 3-1 before Starlin Castro's tying, two-run homer off Mike Fiers in the fourth. Aaron Judge followed with his major league-leading 14th homer, a 441-foot drive off the padding above the center field restaurant behind Monument Park.	Houston took a 6-4 lead in the seventh against Adam Warren (1-0), but New York came right back in the bottom half when Holliday hit a run-scoring infield single against Will Harris (1-1) and Castro tied it with an opposite-field double to right off Devenski. Judge was intentionally walked, Didi Gregorius struck out on three pitches and Headley sent a hanging changeup rolling to the right-center wall.	"You just tell yourself to relax and try to take a deep breath and keep everything in perspective," Headley said. "When you haven't gotten a hit in a while, it feels like it's been five years since you've gotten a hit."	DRESS TO IMPRESS	Both teams wore special Mother's Day uniforms, undershirts and caps with pink elements, and many players used pink bats.	LONG BALLS	Judge has a big league-high six homers of 435 feet or more. He had gone six games and 27 at-bats since his previous home run on May 3. ... Springer had his fourth multihomer game, his first since last May 26, and raised his season home run total to nine.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: 2B Jose Altuve appeared to be limping slightly before he was pinch run for in the ninth inning of the second game.	Yankees: 1B Greg Bird, who hasn't played since May 1 because of a bone bruise in his right ankle, still has not been cleared to resume baseball activities.	UP NEXT	Astros: Joe Musgrove (2-3) starts Monday's series opener at Miami. Musgrove and Dallas Keuchel planned to fly ahead of the team Sunday evening.	Yankees: After day off, CC Sabathia (2-2) starts Tuesday at Kansas City.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

CLEVELAND --  After Carlos Carrasco left with an injury Monday night, the Indians bullpen managed to close things out.	Cleveland just hopes it doesn't have to cover for the right-hander much longer.	Carrasco exited in the fourth inning because of tightness in his left pectoral muscle, but five relievers kept the lead and helped the Indians hold off the Tampa Bay Rays 8-7.	Carrasco isn't sure if he'll miss a start.	"I don't worry about that," he said. "I'm waiting until tomorrow. We'll see what's going and go from there."	Cleveland's rotation is already missing one pillar, with right-hander Corey Kluber on the disabled list because of a strained lower back.	Carrasco was pulled after a visit by manager Terry Francona following an RBI single to Brad Miller. He allowed five runs in 3 2/3 innings and left with Cleveland ahead 7-4.	"Tito made the right decision to take me out before it got worse," Carrasco said.	"He wasn't letting it go, and it made me start to worry a little bit," Francona said. "We'll certainly look at him more tomorrow. We'll have a much better read."	Boone Logan (1-0), who entered in the fifth, retired both batters he faced. Andrew Miller allowed his first run of the season in the eighth, and Cody Allen gave up a solo homer to Peter Bourjos in the ninth before recording his 10th save.	Lonnie Chisenhall hit a three-run homer when Cleveland scored five times in the first off Chris Archer (3-2). Francisco Lindor added a solo homer in the eighth.	Carrasco was charged with five runs and threw 75 pitches. He was sidelined in spring training with a sore elbow and didn't pitch in last season's playoffs because of a broken right hand after being hit by a line drive in September.	Archer allowed seven runs in five innings. He gave up five hits, walked six, struck out six and threw 101 pitches. Archer is 0-6 lifetime against Cleveland, the only AL team he hasn't defeated.	"I wish I could have given our team more," he said. "The biggest letdown is us putting up seven runs and not winning. Walking six people is unacceptable."	Edwin Encarnacion had an RBI grounder in the first. The slugger, dropped out of the cleanup spot for the first time this season, went 0 for 5 and is now batting .198.	Encarnacion is stuck in an 0-for-17 slump. He hit 42 homers and drove in 127 runs for Toronto last season before signing a $60 million, three-year contract with Cleveland.	Abraham Almonte started the Indians' second with a triple and scored on a throwing error by catcher Derek Norris. Yan Gomes had an RBI double in the third.	Almonte was removed in the fifth with a sore right shoulder, an injury that occurred during an at-bat last week, and will be placed on the disabled list.	Kevin Kiermaier homered for the Rays.	WELCOME BACK	Francona and Rays manager Kevin Cash have been friends for years. Cash played in Boston while Francona managed the Red Sox and was on Cleveland's coaching staff from 2013-14.	Francona likes to play jokes on Cash when Tampa Bay visits Cleveland each season and did so again while the Rays were taking batting practice Monday. Under the headline, "How Bad is Kevin Cash at the plate?" the scoreboard showed Cash's career stats, including a .183 batting average.	NICE GRAB	Logan Morrison leaned into the first base stands in the seventh for Encarnacion's foul ball. Not only did he make the catch, he also ended up with an Indians' cap that a fan tossed toward the ball in his glove. Morrison threw the cap into the stands before heading back to first base.	"I should have just put the hat in my back pocket," he said. "I was just trying to get above them, and when I did, when I went to squeeze the ball I got the hat, too."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: OF Brandon Guyer (sprained left wrist) will miss four to six weeks. He was put on the 10-day DL on Sunday.	UP NEXT	Rays: RHP Jake Odorizzi has allowed one earned run or less in his last five starts.	Indians: RHP Danny Salazar didn't get through three innings despite being given two early leads in his last start against Toronto.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

MIAMI --  Short on sleep, the Houston Astros were listless and hitless until the fifth inning. Then their lumber stirred from its slumber.	Yuli Gurriel hit a grand slam and Jose Altuve homered and drove in three runs as Houston overcame a slow start to beat the Miami Marlins 7-2 Monday night.	The Astros arrived at their hotel at 5 a.m. after a doubleheader in New York against the Yankees, and Dan Straily shut them out for five innings.	"Sometimes it takes a little while to get untracked," Houston manager A.J. Hinch said. "Credit to the pitcher when he does that against an offense like this."	Straily left the game after a comebacker bruised his right arm, and the Astros' bats soon came to life. Josh Reddick doubled in the sixth off Junichi Tazawa (1-1), and after a walk and a hit batter loaded the bases, Gurriel pulled a 94 mph fastball over the fence with two outs for a 4-1 lead.	The Astros' second grand slam of the year was also their second in two games. Alex Bregman hit one in Sunday night's win at Yankee Stadium.	It's the first time Houston has ever had slams in consecutive games.	Altuve shook off a fastball to the hand in the first inning and homered into the Marlins Park home run sculpture in the ninth.	"It was a long day Sunday," Altuve said. "But we got some rest and did what we've been doing -- playing really good ball."	Joe Musgrove (3-3) allowed one run in 5 2/3 innings for the Astros (27-12), who climbed 15 games above .500 for the first time since 2005. They have the best record in the majors and are off to the best start in franchise history.	Houston began the game leading the American League in hits and batting average but managed only one hit in five innings against Straily.	The right-hander left the game as a precaution after he was hit near his pitching elbow by a line drive off Evan Gattis' bat to start the fifth. A bruise just below the elbow was visible almost immediately, but after consulting with a trainer and manager Don Mattingly, Straily finished the inning.	Straily said he expects to make his next start despite the bruise.	"The ball caught me right on a muscle on my foreman," he said. "I'm very fortunate that it wasn't at my face or hitting any bones in my arm. I got pretty lucky in that regard. Hopefully it's just a sore muscle in my arm."	Altuve was hit on the left hand by a 92 mph fastball from Straily but stayed in the game and contributed a two-run single in the seventh, then hit his sixth homer in the ninth.	"In the moment I felt it a little, but then it went away," Altuve said. "I was able to swing the bat, so I feel good, especially because we won."	The Astros' George Springer went 0 for 5, ending his 13-game hitting streak.	Justin Bour homered and had three hits for the Marlins. They outhit the Astros 12-8 but went 1 for 10 with runners in scoring position and fell to 1-6 on their homestand.	BULLPEN WOES	Three Miami relievers combined to allow seven runs in four innings. Tazawa's ERA rose to 6.60, and he has allowed four homers in 16 innings.	"I don't want to make excuses," he said. "I'll continue to work hard and hope I can help this team."	BAD BASERUNNING	The Marlins had two runners thrown out on the bases in the third. J.T. Riddle was out trying to stretch a single when left fielder Norichika Aoki made a strong throw to second. Dee Gordon singled with two outs and was picked off.	DROUGHT	Straily has allowed only 24 hits in 43 innings this year, but is winless since April 11 and 1/3 overall.	UP NEXT	Houston LHP Dallas Keuchel (6-0, 1.69 ERA) tries to become the first seven-game winner in the majors when he starts Tuesday night against RHP Tom Koehler (1-1, 5.60).	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

TORONTO --  Bartolo Colon gave Atlanta five innings. That was enough on a tough night for the big right-hander.	Colon brushed off an illness and got his first victory in a month, and the Braves snapped Toronto's five-game win streak with a 10-6 victory over the Blue Jays on Monday.	Freddie Freeman hit his 13th homer and Nick Markakis had three RBI for Atlanta, which has won three of four. Matt Kemp had four hits and scored three times.	Colon (2-4) allowed three runs, two earned, and seven hits. He struck out one and walked two while throwing 81 pitches.	"That was real big, because this is a hot ballclub," Braves manager Brian Snitker said. "We come in here and these guys are swinging the bats really well. I guarantee you an outing like that will do a lot for him and his confidence going forward."	Colon allowed fewer than four runs for the third time in eight starts this season. He said he kept the Blue Jays off balance by relying on off-speed pitches earlier and more often.	"Everything was working today," Colon said through a translator. "Everything felt good."	Everything, that is, except for Colon's stomach. Already bothered by a head cold and headache, he developed an upset stomach as the day went on.	"After five, I thought that was enough for him," Snitker said. "We just didn't want to push him anymore. He'd done his job at that point."	Kemp said it was easy to tell Colon had good stuff against the Jays.	"You could even see it from left field," Kemp said. "He was definitely moving the ball more. When he does that, it's tough to pick up that run."	Kemp singled and scored in the first, singled in the third, then doubled and scored in the fifth and sixth. He walked in his final plate appearance.	Freeman matched Washington's Ryan Zimmerman and Milwaukee's Eric Thames atop the NL home run leaderboard with a three-run shot off Leonel Campos. Freeman's long drive to center was the big blow in Atlanta's four-run sixth.	Freeman has connected against all 10 teams Atlanta has faced this season.	Markakis hit a two-run single in the first and singled home a run in the fifth.	Braves third baseman Adonis Garcia had two RBI and scored twice. Shortstop Dansby Swanson also had two RBI.	Making his second start of the season, Blue Jays right-hander Mike Bolsinger (0-2) allowed six runs in 4 2/3 innings.	"It was a tough outing for him," manager John Gibbons said. "I didn't think he had his good curveball, which is kind of vital to him."	Toronto's Justin Smoak hit a two-run homer off Josh Collmenter in the ninth.	Devon Travis had two RBI doubles for the Blue Jays and Jose Bautista also doubled home a run. Catcher Mike Ohlman delivered an RBI single in the fourth for the first hit of his career.	LEAVING THEIR MARK	The Blue Jays set a franchise record by hitting five batters. Bolsinger hit Brandon Phillips in the first, Garcia in the second and Jace Peterson in the fourth. Campos hit Tyler Flowers in the sixth and Aaron Loup hit Markakis in the eighth.	QUOTE OF THE DAY	"He was feeling a little puny, if that's possible." -- Snitker on the 280-pound Colon's illness.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: LF Steve Pearce (right calf) was placed on the 10-day disabled list and RHP Leonel Campos was recalled from Triple-A Buffalo ... Gibbons said 3B Josh Donaldson (right calf) could be ready to return as soon as this weekend. Donaldson has not played since April 13. ... SS Troy Tulowitzki (right hamstring) went 1 for 3 with an RBI at Class A Dunedin. Tulowitzki's double play partner was Cavan Biggio, the son of former Astros star Craig Biggio.	UP NEXT	Braves: LHP Jaime Garcia (1-2, 4.33 ERA) is 2-1 with a 1.80 ERA in three career starts against the Blue Jays.	Blue Jays: RHP Marco Estrada (2-2, 3.12) allowed two runs in six innings to beat Seattle in his previous outing, winning for the second time in three starts.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.

PHOENIX --  The Arizona Diamondbacks became the latest team to tee off against the New York Mets' beleaguered bullpen.	Yasmany Tomas, Jeff Mathis and Daniel Descalso homered in a six-run eighth inning and the Diamondbacks handed the struggling Mets their fifth straight loss, 7-3 on Monday night.	"We'd been a little dormant with our offense," Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said. "We hadn't seen a big inning like that in several games, so it was nice to kind of get off the ground a little bit and watch the guys have a little fun and get after it."	Jake Lamb also went deep for the Diamondbacks. Zack Godley and three relievers limited the Mets to four hits.	Tomas snapped a 1-all tie with a three-run homer off Hansel Robles (4-1). Mathis' two-run shot also came against Robles, hit hard for the second consecutive outing after a strong start to the season.	"We use him often because he has such a great arm," Collins said, "but when you've got to make pitches, he has had a tough time making the quality pitch he needs to make."	Robles "went two whole weeks without giving up a run. Then in his last two times out he got knocked around," Collins said. "We don't have a lot of options."	New York relievers have given up seven homers in the last five games and compiled a 13.80 ERA over 15 innings. This was the fifth straight game in which the injury-depleted Mets allowed four or more runs in an inning.	Paul Goldschmidt appeared to give Arizona a 2-1 lead with a leadoff homer against Robles in the eighth. But after a video review, umpires ruled the ball hit the yellow line on the batter's eye in straightaway center and the call was changed to a double.	Lamb was intentionally walked to bring up Tomas, who hit Robles' 3-2 pitch far above that same home run line to boost his big numbers against the Mets.	Brandon Drury doubled and, after an out, Mathis homered to left to make it 6-1. Descalso followed with a pinch-hit shot off Josh Edgin.	"We started to get a little confidence as a group," said Mathis, never known for his hitting. "Contagious, whatever you want to call it. It's always nice to string a few together like that."	Jorge De La Rosa (2-0) pitched a scoreless eighth for the win.	Pinch-hitter Wilmer Flores connected for a two-run homer in the ninth for New York.	Godley, making his second start in place of injured Shelby Miller, allowed only one hit in 6 2/3 innings and left with the score tied at 1. He struck out seven and walked five.	"I didn't have my greatest stuff," Godley said. "But I battled through some tough innings with walks, and the defense played outstanding behind me again."	Lovullo said it was safe to say Godley had earned another start.	New York starter Zack Wheeler went six-plus effective innings. He permitted one run and seven hits, struck out six and walked one.	Mets starters have gone 15 consecutive games without getting an out in the seventh inning.	New York's first run came after Jose Reyes and Curtis Granderson drew one-out walks in the second. Rene Rivera followed with an RBI single to right, the lone hit allowed by Godley.	Arizona finally broke through when Lamb led off the seventh with an opposite-field home run, hitting Wheeler's 2-0 pitch over the left-center wall to tie it at 1.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: SS Asdrubal Cabrera wasn't in the lineup and could be headed for the disabled list with a left thumb injury. A decision is expected Tuesday.	Diamondbacks: CF A.J. Pollock was placed on the 10-day DL with a right groin strain. No timetable was set for his return, but Pollock said it "is not a significant injury by any means." He was hurt in the 10th inning of Sunday's loss to Pittsburgh. ... RF David Peralta was out of the lineup after leaving Sunday's game in the eighth inning with right glute tightness. He popped out to center as a pinch hitter in the seventh.	GARDY'S BACK	Ron Gardenhire was back as bench coach for the Diamondbacks. The longtime Minnesota manager had not been with Arizona since April 9, when he left the team to be treated for prostate cancer. Gardenhire underwent surgery to remove the gland on April 18.	HOMESICK	The Mets have allowed 78 runs in their last eight road games.	UP NEXT	Arizona RHP Zack Greinke (4-2, 2.79 ERA), who took a no-hit bid into the eighth inning to beat Pittsburgh in his last outing, faces Mets LHP Tommy Milone (1-0, 5.88) on Tuesday night. Milone will make his second start for New York after being claimed off waivers from Milwaukee.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  After a brief absence with a hamstring issue, Mike Trout undoubtedly has his legs under him.	Trout homered for the fourth consecutive game, helping the Los Angeles Angels top the Chicago White Sox 5-3 on Monday night.	The Angels scored each of their runs via the long ball. Kole Calhoun hit a three-run homer to right in the fifth inning, and Trout followed with a drive to left. Martin Maldonado homered in the seventh inning.	Trout missed five games with the hamstring issue, then went hitless in his return. His homer streak started the next day.	Even Trout's teammates, who have been watching him do his thing for years, continued to be amazed by the two-time AL MVP.	"Unbelievable. What, first game didn't get a hit, and now he's back to Mike Trout," Calhoun said. "The guy, every day, he's going to amaze you with something."	It was the first set of back-to-back homers this season for Los Angeles. Trout became the first Angel to hit a home run in four consecutive days since Mark Trumbo in May 2012.	"I think he's comfortable in the box," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "It took him a couple of at-bats to get in a flow. Mike's swinging it."	Angels right-hander Jesse Chavez (3-5) pitched seven-plus innings and Bud Norris got four outs for his eighth save. The White Sox put runners on first and second with two out in the ninth, but Kevan Smith struck out looking to end the game.	Jose Abreu hit a two-run homer for Chicago, and Tyler Saladino had an RBI triple. Mike Pelfrey (0-4) allowed four runs and three hits in 4 2/3 innings.	Leury Garcia hit a leadoff single in the fourth for Chicago's first baserunner. After Melky Cabrera lined out, Abreu hit a drive to right-center for his sixth homer.	Saladino's big hit made it 3-0 in the fifth, but the Angels responded in the bottom half. It was Calhoun's fifth homer of the season and No. 12 for Trout.	"It's unbelievable," Chavez said of Trout. "I mess with the guys all the time, `You guys have been spoiled.' I'm relishing every moment of it, watching him go in every day and do his work and the way he prepares and the way he goes about his business. It's bar none, hands down, the best I've seen."	ANOTHER SHOT	Right-hander Gregorio Infante pitched in the majors for the first time since Oct. 1, 2010. The White Sox purchased his contract from Triple-A Charlotte, and infielder Cody Asche was optioned to Charlotte.	The 29-year-old Infante made 10 appearances with the White Sox in 2010, his only major league season, and returns again, seven years later. Infante pitched a scoreless eighth inning for the White Sox.	"I'm sure he's pretty excited, like anything, when you've been away a little bit," White Sox manager Rick Renteria said. "I'm sure he's been working very hard trying to do what he wanted to do to be able to get here. We saw him in the spring, and he did a nice job for us. He's been here, he's experienced. Hopefully he'll feel comfortable with all his teammates."	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox: C Geovany Soto was moved to the 60-day DL after it was determined he will have arthroscopic surgery on his right elbow Tuesday in Chicago. The surgery will be done to remove debridement with loose body removal in his right elbow. ... RHP James Shields (right lat strain) is expected to start a throwing program Tuesday.	Angels: RHP Huston Street (right lat strain) is expected to throw to hitters this week in Arizona. ... RHP Mike Morin (neck tightness) is expected to throw to hitters Tuesday. ... RHP Andrew Bailey (right shoulder inflammation) had a doctor visit on Monday but results weren't yet available. ... INF Yunel Escobar (left hamstring) was placed on the 10-day disabled list, and INF Jefrey Marte was recalled from Triple-A Salt Lake City.	UP NEXT	White Sox: LHP Derek Holland (3-3, 2.43 ERA) allowed three home runs in his last start Thursday against the Twins. He had given up just three home runs all season. Holland has pitched five quality starts in his last seven outings. His 2.43 ERA is 10th-lowest in the majors.	Angels: RHP JC Ramirez (3-3, 4.20 ERA) has a 12.00 ERA in the first inning since being moved into the starting rotation. Yet, he is tied for the most wins (three) of any pitcher on staff. He allowed five runs in seven innings in his last start Thursday against Detroit, a 7-1 loss.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

SEATTLE -- After expecting the night off, Tony Zych made the most of a surprise call in the ninth inning.	Nelson Cruz and Kyle Seager each hit a two-run homer, and Zych bailed out struggling closer Edwin Diaz with a game-ending strikeout with the bases loaded to preserve Seattle's 6-5 victory over the Oakland Athletics as the Mariners made the most of four hits on Monday.	Oakland scored twice in the ninth, when Diaz walked four of the five batters he faced to force in a run. Zych relieved, and the second run scored on Khris Davis' groundout. After an intentional walk to Yonder Alonso loaded the bases again, Zych struck out Adam Rosales looking on a 3-2 pitch for his first major league save.	"I knew it was close, and got excited when he called it," said Zych, who had 20 saves in the minors. "I've been a closer forever. You don't close here. We've got an unbelievable guy, Eddie, and obviously he was a little shaky tonight, but with his stuff, he'll be fine. It was special for me."	Diaz, who had 18 saves last season as a rookie after moving into the closer's role on Aug. 1, gave up the game-winning home run Sunday in a 3-2 loss at Toronto, where the Mariners were swept four straight.	"Tony Zych, great job tonight," manager Scott Servais said. "He was actually supposed to be down tonight. We got to the point where we just had to go for it. Obviously, it didn't look like Eddie was going to work his way out of it."	Cruz's home run, his ninth, put Seattle up 4-0 in the second as the Mariners capitalized on five walks by Sean Manaea (1-3), activated off the disabled list earlier in the day.	Oakland pulled to 4-3 on a solo homer by Davis in the fourth and a two-run shot by Stephen Vogt in the fifth. Both came off starter Yovanni Gallardo (2-3), who allowed three runs and four hits in 6 1/3 innings.	Seager made it 6-3 in the eighth with his third home run. Guillermo Heredia, who reached on a two-base throwing error by shortstop Chad Pinder, scored ahead of Seager.	Manaea's four walks after a leadoff single by Jean Segura led to a pair of Seattle runs in a 38-pitch first inning. Manaea escaped further damage by striking out Tuffy Gosewisch with the bases loaded to end the inning.	After Cruz's homer, Manaea retired his final 10 batters. He allowed four runs and two hits in five innings with seven strikeouts in his first start since April 26.	"He was really rusty at the beginning and I'm surprised we got five innings out of him, because 90 pitches was as far as he was going to go," Oakland manager Bob Melvin said. "And he gave us pretty much exactly that. In the first inning he was one more hitter away from coming out in the first inning, so he looked a little rusty early on but got it together."	OUT OF TROUBLE	Seattle escaped in the seventh after Vogt walked with one out and Pinder doubled, chasing Gallardo. Dan Altaville relieved and walked Rajai Davis on four pitches to load the bases, but Matt Joyce struck out and Jed Lowrie bounced to second. "It's easy to look back and see the last inning play out, but there was some opportunities earlier, too," Melvin said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: RHP John Axford (strained right shoulder) is likely to make his second rehab appearance with Triple-A Nashville on Tuesday. ... C Bruce Maxwell was optioned to Nashville to make room for Manaea, who had been sidelined with a strained left shoulder. Manaea made one rehab start at Nashville.	Mariners: 2B Robinson Cano (sore quadriceps) sat out again. He originally was in the lineup, but was scratched. ... RHP Steve Cishek was activated off the 10-day DL after recovering from hip surgery, and LHP Zac Curtis was optioned to Double-A Arkansas. Cishek entered in the eighth and retired his only batter. ... OF Mitch Haniger, on the 10-day DL with a strained right oblique, hit off a tee in the batting cage. "Really positive and moving in the right direction," Servais said. ... LHP James Paxton (left forearm strain) recently played light catch and is projected to throw a bullpen Wednesday or Thursday.	UP NEXT	Athletics: RHP Andrew Triggs (5-2, 2.21 ERA) has given up just one home run in 40 2/3 innings over seven starts. In four of his starts, he did not allow an earned run. One of his two losses, however, was at home against Seattle, when he was tagged for a season-high six runs and five hits in 4 2/3 innings.	Mariners: Rookie RHP Chase De Jong (0-3, 7.85), acquired from the Dodgers in early March, makes his third major league start. He's had one solid start -- one run on four hits in six innings -- between a pair of rocky outings.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

SAN DIEGO --  Rookie Hunter Renfroe gave the San Diego Padres a huge boost a day after they took an embarrassing loss.	Renfroe hit a two-run homer with no outs in the 10th inning to lift the Padres to a 6-5 win against the Milwaukee Brewers on Monday night.	"That was my very first walk-off home run," said Renfroe, who was called up late last season and hit four home runs in 11 games. "That's pretty special."	Renfroe's homer to left, his seventh, came off Oliver Drake (2-1) with Erick Aybar aboard on a leadoff single. Renfroe drove in four runs a day after homering and driving in three during a 9-3 loss to the Chicago White Sox.	The Padres allowed the White Sox to score eight runs in the eighth inning of that loss.	San Diego had leads of 3-0 and 4-2 on Monday night before letting the Brewers back in it.	"If you let it, it starts to have the feeling of, here it goes again," Padres manager Andy Green said. "But the guys fought it today and I thought the energy in the dugout even going into the last inning was great."	The Brewers took a 5-4 lead in the top of the 10th on Eric Sogard's homer with one out against Jose Torres (2-2).	Sogard, a former Padres farmhand, hit a high, arcing shot to right, his second. He was called up from Triple-A on Friday and made his first big league appearance since Oct. 2, 2015. He missed all of last season after having knee surgery.	Renfroe, who has been showing better discipline at the plate, won it in the bottom of the frame on a 3-2 pitch.	"I knew I hit it pretty well," Renfroe said. "I knew I didn't get all of it, obviously. I hit it on a line. It had a decent chance of getting out or being a double, over his head or being caught. I knew I hit it decently well."	Renfroe has been taking more walks, which has helped him get more strikes.	"He was swinging at a ton of pitches outside the strike zone, which gives him limited opportunity to show that power," Green said. "As he started to shrink the zone, pitchers started coming back toward it and then he drives balls in the gap and drives runs in. He's making an adjustment back to the league right now and that's really good to see."	The Brewers tied it at 4 in the eighth. Hernan Perez's leadoff fly ball to shallow right off Brad Hand went for a triple when second baseman Cory Spangenberg and right fielder Renfroe both went for it and missed. Perez scored the tying run on Domingo Santana's RBI single to right with one out. Santana was thrown out trying to stretch it into a double. Santana had three hits and drove in three runs.	That blew what would have been San Diego starter Luis Perdomo's first win of the season. Perdomo struck out a career-high nine and hit an RBI triple and a double, yet got his sixth straight no-decision to open the season, a Padres record.	"We scrapped back, kept answering, kept coming back," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. "We put some rallies together. We put pressure on them for sure."	Perdomo's two-out triple to center in the second gave the Padres a 3-0 lead. It brought in Renfroe, who hit a two-run double with one out.	Perdomo doubled leading off the fifth and scored on Spangenberg's single to make it 4-2.	The Brewers scored twice in the fourth. Perdomo hit Sogard with a pitch leading off and then allowed three straight singles, including Santana's two-run base knock to center.	Jesus Aguilar homered to straightaway center field off Perdomo in the sixth, his third. Aguilar tripled in the10th, leaving him a double short of the cycle.	Perdomo allowed three runs and five hits, with no walks. His previous strikeout high was eight against Baltimore on June 21, 2016.	Brewers starter Chase Anderson allowed four runs and six hits in 5 1/3 innings, struck out five and walked three.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: 1B Eric Thames got the night off because he wasn't feeling well and 3B Travis Shaw was out of the lineup with a swollen index finger suffered Sunday.	Padres: Green said a CT scan revealed LF Travis Jankowski has a fracture in his left foot and he'll be out an additional six weeks. Jankowski fouled a ball off his foot April 14 in Atlanta and was placed on the DL on April 24, retroactive to April 23.	UP NEXT	Brewers: RHP Jimmy Nelson (1-2, 3.99) looks to break through at Petco Park, where he is 0-2 with an 8.00 ERA in two starts.	Padres: LHP Clayton Richard (2-4, 4.34) is looking for his first win in five starts. He has two losses and two no-decisions since beating Arizona 4-1 on April 20.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

SAN FRANCISCO -- After a 12-24 start to the season when nearly everything went wrong, the breaks are finally starting to go in favor of the San Francisco Giants.	Eduardo Nunez was credited with a two-run infield single when Los Angeles pitcher Brandon McCarthy lost track of a baserunner and the Giants beat the Dodgers 8-4 on Monday night for their season-high fourth straight win.	The hit by Nunez that scored Brandon Crawford from second base was the key play in a four-run fourth inning that broke the game open and helped Matt Cain (3-1) earn his second win of the season against the Dodgers.	"We've gotten so many of those this year," Crawford said sarcastically about the fortunate break. "That's just something that happens. I don't think I've ever seen that before. It's just one of those things in baseball, you see something new every day."	San Francisco opened the inning with three straight hits off McCarthy (3-1), with an RBI double by Crawford putting the Giants up 2-1. That's when things really got interesting.	With runners on second and third, Nunez hit a broken-bat grounder up the middle that shortstop Corey Seager fielded just beyond the infield dirt. Buster Posey easily scored from third on the play. Crawford appeared in trouble when third-base coach Phil Nevin waved him around third not realizing Seager had fielded the ball.	Seager made an off-balance throw toward home that McCarthy cut off on the mound after he had forgotten to back up home. With his back to the plate, McCarthy didn't see Crawford caught between third and home and instead focused on Nunez, who took a wide turn around first and didn't stop.	McCarthy had to wait to throw to second until Seager got back there, and Nunez slid in safely while Crawford easily scored the third run of the inning.	"He shouldn't have been in the middle of the diamond," manager Dave Roberts said. "The mechanics of the play, he should have been behind home plate, so that's where it gets funky from the beginning. ... He's not used to being in that situation, having the feel or the awareness of the baserunner."	Nunez then stole third when McCarthy failed to keep him close, and scored on a sacrifice fly.	The Giants added two runs in the seventh against Grant Dayton when Posey hit his fifth homer in his past seven games, and Nunez added an RBI double.	"Those guys in there have gone through some tough times in the early go," manager Bruce Bochy said. "We're not going to get giddy here. We've dug ourselves a hole. Every day we have to come out and try to play our best game. These guys are doing that right now. You want to believe the work was going to turn and at this point it has."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: 1B Adrian Gonzalez (right elbow) is expected to play seven innings in the first game of his rehab assignment Tuesday for Class A Rancho Cucamonga. 2B Logan Forsythe (toe) is expected to get three ABs in the game as the DH.	Giants: RF Hunter Pence was placed on the 10-day DL retroactive to Saturday with a strained left hamstring. Pence said he hopes to be ready to come off when eligible May 23. ... Closer Mark Melancon (sore forearm) threw a 22-pitch bullpen session and is expected to be activated from the DL in the next couple of days.	CAIN'S MILESTONE	When he completed the third inning, Cain became the 12th Giants pitcher to reach the 2,000-innings mark with the franchise. The last pitcher to get to 2,000 innings with the Giants was Gaylord Perry in 1970.	Cain allowed an RBI double to Yasmani Grandal in the third inning and nothing else in 6 2/3 innings of work. He has allowed one run in 12 2/3 innings against Los Angeles this season.	CALLED UP	Mac Williamson was called up for the first time this year to replace Pence and made an immediate impact with two hits, an RBI and a run scored. Williamson started the season in the minors after a quadriceps injury in spring training and just recently found is groove.	UP NEXT	Rich Hill (1-1) is set to come off the DL because of a blister to make the start for the Dodgers against Ty Blach (0-2).	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

TORONTO -- Braves manager Brian Snitker calls first baseman Freddie Freeman "a boring professional."	Snitker's only half right. These days, there's plenty of excitement whenever Freeman swings the bat.	Dansby Swanson hit a tiebreaking homer in the seventh inning, Freeman added a two-run shot and the Atlanta Braves beat the Toronto Blue Jays 9-5 on Wednesday, sweeping their two-game series.	Swanson snapped a 5-all tie with a leadoff drive to center off Danny Barnes (0-1).	"I felt like I hit it so well that you kind of don't even feel it," Swanson said. "You just catch it right on the sweet spot."	Freeman hit his NL-leading 14th home run, matching Yankees slugger Aaron Judge for most in the majors. It was Freeman's second homer in two games.	Freeman, who has four home runs in seven games at Rogers Centre, has said playing for Canada in the World Baseball Classic helped him get off to a strong start this season.	"I've felt locked in since March," Freeman said. "I guess I've got to go play winter ball (next year)."	Swanson said the ultra-consistent Freeman is "a joy to watch."	"It's truly remarkable what he's able to do," Swanson said. "He doesn't change anything ever. He's so good at staying within himself, understanding what he does best and going up there and doing that. He does it day in and day out."	Matt Kemp had two hits and four RBI for the Braves, who have won four of five after losing eight of their previous nine.	"We've been swinging the bats well and the pitching is coming around," Freeman said. "We're all starting to play together."	Kevin Pillar homered and had two hits for Toronto. Pillar's sixth homer, a solo shot off Jamie Garcia, was his ML-leading 51st hit.	The Blue Jays have lost two straight following a season-high five game winning streak.	"We just couldn't stop their offense," manager John Gibbons said.	Jose Ramirez (2-1) pitched 1 2/3 innings for the win.	Kemp hit a two-run single in the first and the Braves took a 3-0 lead on Jace Peterson's RBI single in the fourth.	Garcia held Toronto hitless until Pillar doubled to begin the fourth. Justin Smoak drew a two-out walk and both runners scored on a double by Devon Travis.	Freeman made it 5-2 by connecting off Marco Estrada in the fifth, but Pillar replied with his homer in the bottom half.	Toronto chased Garcia and tied it in the sixth. Ramirez came on after Smoak's one-out walk and gave up a double to Travis, an RBI single to Darwin Barney and an RBI groundout by Ezequiel Carrera.	The Blue Jays put runners at first and second with none out against Arodys Vizcaino in the eighth but couldn't score. Travis struck out after failing to get a bunt down and Barney lined into a double play with pinch-runner Darrell Ceciliani doubled off second.	OUT OF THEIR LEAGUE	The Blue Jays are 1-6 in interleague play.	KING OF THE ROAD	Swanson went 2 for 4 to finish the road trip at 9 for 23 (.391). He has at least one hit in eight straight games, and has reached safely in 18 of 19.	DOUBLE YOUR PLEASURE	Travis has 12 doubles this month, a new Blue Jays record for doubles in a month by a second baseman. Aaron Hill had 11 in September, 2009.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Braves: OF Emilio Bonifacio was sent home Monday suffering from the same illness that bothered RHP Bartolo Colon. Bonifacio did not participate in batting practice Tuesday, but was expected to report to the stadium later in the game.	Blue Jays: Toronto recalled Ceciliani from Triple-A Buffalo and optioned RHP Leonel Campos to Triple-A. ... SS Troy Tulowitzki (right hamstring) went 0 for 2 with a walk in a rehab game at Class A Dunedin. He's expected to come off the DL on Thursday. ... LHP Francisco Liriano (shoulder) played catch Monday and is expected to try throwing off the mound later this week. ...

CLEVELAND --  The Tampa Bay Rays went to the home run ball in Tuesday night's 6-4 victory over the Cleveland Indians.	Corey Dickerson hit two of Tampa Bay's season-high five homers, including a 449-foot blast that landed in the trees beyond the center field wall in the fifth.	"It was one of my top ones, to be able to hit it clean like that and to know it's gone," he said. "The ones to dead center always feel good. I thought it was further than 450, though."	Dickerson also hit a solo homer in the third off Danny Salazar (2-4). Colby Rasmus and Derek Norris added solo shots off Cleveland's starter while Tim Beckham hit a two-run homer off Shawn Armstrong.	Jake Odorizzi (3-2) allowed four runs in six innings. The right-hander took a 6-1 lead into the sixth, but Edwin Encarnacion broke an 0-for-18 skid with a two-run homer to cap a three-run rally.	"I know we got a bunch of solo shots in there, and then Beck came up with a big two-run blast," Rays manager Kevin Cash said. "The offense definitely carried over into this game and got us a nice cushion there for Odo to work with."	Jose Alvarado retired all six batters he faced and Alex Colome pitched out of a ninth-inning jam for his 10th save.	Encarnacion led off with a single, but Colome retired Jose Ramirez on a groundout and struck out Lonnie Chisenhall and Yan Gomes.	Indians center fielder Bradley Zimmer was 0 for 3 and struck out three times in his major league debut. Cleveland called up its No. 1 pick in 2014 from Triple-A Columbus earlier Tuesday.	The Rays won despite striking out 16 times.	Rasmus homered with two outs in the second while Norris and Dickerson went back-to-back to start the third. Beckham's sixth-inning home run pushed the lead to 6-1.	After using five relievers in Monday's win, the Indians needed Salazar to pitch deep into the game, but he was pulled following a leadoff double in the sixth. The right-hander was charged with five runs and struck out nine in five-plus innings.	"I'm going to give you a couple of adjectives," Indians manager Terry Francona said when asked about Salazar's performance. "One's vexing. He has good enough stuff to punch out nine. Gives up six hits, four of them are home runs. When he made a mistake he really paid for it."	Salazar was coming off a shaky outing against Toronto, in which he couldn't hold two early leads and allowed five runs in 2 2/3 innings. He hasn't won since April 29.	"I've been struggling," Salazar said. "Today, I was able to bring my ball down a little bit, but things just aren't working the way I'm expecting."	MEMORIES	With Zimmer playing his first game, Francona recalled his major league debut with the Montreal Expos against the Houston Astros on Aug. 19, 1981. He was scheduled to be in the lineup against Nolan Ryan, but a strike by air traffic controllers delayed his flight from Denver, where he had been playing in Triple-A, to Houston.	Ryan was pitching a no-hitter when Francona arrived at the Astrodome in the fourth inning. He pinch hit in the eighth and grounded out against Dave Smith.	HE'S UP	RHP Erasmo Ramirez makes his second start of the season Friday against the Yankees. He will take the place of LHP Blake Snell, who was optioned to minors last week, in the rotation.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: 2B Brad Miller (strained left abdominal muscle) was scratched about two hours before the game.	Indians: RHP Carlos Carrasco (strained left pectoral muscle) will resume his between starts routine in a couple of days. He's scheduled to start again on May 23 against Cincinnati.	UP NEXT	Rays: RHP Alex Cobb is 2-2 in four regular-season starts against Cleveland. He pitched 6 2/3 scoreless innings and got the win in 2013 AL wild card game at Progressive Field	Indians: RHP Josh Tomlin was the losing pitcher in his last start against Minnesota, despite allowing only Miguel Sano's solo homer in eight innings.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

PITTSBURGH -- Bryce Harper has known for about a year that PNC Park was the only stadium in the National League in which the Washington Nationals star hadn't gone deep.	One vicious swing on Tuesday night checked it off the list.	Harper sent a laser to the last row of seats in right field in the top of the ninth for his 13th home run, and that give Washington's erratic bullpen a little extra breathing room in an 8-4 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates. Only a protective fence prevented the ball from ending up in the Allegheny River.	Not that Harper was aiming or anything.	"I don't worry about hitting the ball in the water," Harper said. "[Former manager] Matt [Williams] used to say, 'It's not how far. It's how many.' Just trying to put the ball in play, and sometimes it goes over the fence."	Or a lot of the time, if you happen to be Harper or the other bats in baseball's most explosive lineup. Such are the riches for the Nationals at the moment that Ryan Zimmerman went 2-for-5 with a two-run double ... and was leapfrogged by Harper for the top batting average in the majors (.388). Zimmerman's two RBIs pushed his total to a major-league-leading 38, two clear of Harper's tally.	Jayson Werth added three hits and is batting .457 (16-for-35) in his past nine games. Wilmer Difo lined a shot to the seats in center field for his first home run of the season for Washington, which has won four of five.	Stephen Strasburg (4-1) allowed three runs in six-plus innings, walking one and striking out three on a night when his stuff was more ordinary than electric.	"I got a little bit better command-wise, but I felt like I was grinding through it all night," Strasburg said. "It wasn't my best, but they picked me up."	Josh Harrison had two hits for the Pirates, including his sixth home run of the season, and he avoided a tag at second base with an acrobatic slide in the sixth. Chad Kuhl (1-4) remains winless since the first week of the season.	LOSING HIS KUHL	The Nationals are in the process of running away with the NL East not even a quarter of the way into the season, thanks to the best offense in baseball. The lineup wasted little time getting to Kuhl, who hasn't won since he beat Atlanta six weeks ago.	Trea Turner led off with a double and scored on Werth's RBI single. Strasburg led off the third with a single and moved to second on a single by Werth, and Zimmerman followed one batter later with a double that put the Nationals in front 4-1. Michael Taylor tripled with one out in the fourth, and Difo, who came in batting just .196, sent Kuhl's pitch to the seats for his first home run of the season to make it 6-1. Kuhl's ERA ballooned to 6.69 in eight starts.	"I hate losing," Kuhl said. "I hate falling behind hitters. It's a really big challenge for me."	WHAT A RELIEF	Washington's bullpen began the day with a 5.53 ERA, third-worst in the majors. It flirted with letting a lead slip away in the seventh, when the Pirates scratched across three runs, thanks in part to a throwing error by Zimmerman. Blake Treinen -- who began the season as the closer before being demoted -- got Harrison to hit into a double play, then struck out Andrew McCutchen to end the threat.	Enny Romero pitched a perfect eighth, and Koda Glover worked around two baserunners in the ninth.	"We're still in the process trying to figure it out and get it together," Washington manager Dusty Baker said. "But in the meantime, our offense is doing the job."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: 3B Stephen Drew is nearly ready for a rehab assignment to deal with his strained right hamstring. 2B Daniel Murphy was held out of the lineup for only the second time this season to give him a chance to rest.	Pirates: RF Gregory Polanco was given the day off to give his strained left hamstring some rest. Polanco was removed from a win over Arizona on Sunday after feeling a twinge.	UP NEXT	Nationals: Jacob Turner (2-1, 3.31 ERA) will make his second start of the season on Wednesday.	Pirates: Gerrit Cole (1-4, 3.04 ERA) searches for his first win in a month on Wednesday. Cole has a 2.08 ERA in his past six starts but has been undone by a lack of support. The Pirates have scored one run or fewer in five of his eight starts.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

DETROIT -- ��� Chris Davis homered in the 12th inning and again in the 13th.	After the second one, the Baltimore Orioles finally held on.	Davis' two-run shot in the 13th put the Orioles ahead to stay, and they snapped a four-game losing streak by outlasting the Detroit Tigers 13-11 on Tuesday night. Davis had led off the 12th with a home run that started a three-run inning for Baltimore, but the Tigers rallied with three of their own in the bottom half to keep the game going.	"That was a lot of fun at the end, but that's a taxing night, especially at the beginning of a series," Davis said. "You don't enjoy one like that unless you win it."	The Orioles led 7-1 after scoring seven runs in the third, but they squandered that big advantage and needed Mark Trumbo's solo shot with two outs in the ninth just to force extra innings. Davis came up with a runner on third in the 13th and hit a drive to right off Francisco Rodriguez (1-5).	Richard Bleier (1-1) earned his first career win, pitching the final 1 2/3 innings for the Orioles.	"I'm pretty excited. With our bullpen, I didn't think the game would get to me, but things just didn't work out," Bleier said. "Everyone is going to have an off night, and we had that happen to a couple guys today, so I'm just glad I could get in there and do my job."	J.D. Martinez homered twice for the Tigers, including a grand slam that put them up 8-7 in the seventh. Victor Martinez also went deep for Detroit, which was one out from a remarkable victory when Trumbo connected off Justin Wilson.	The Tigers had the bases loaded with two outs in the 11th and 12th, but with the winning run 90 feet away, Tyler Collins lined out to right in the 11th and grounded out to second in the 12th. Collins is mired in an 0-for-30 slump, and Detroit didn't have any position players left to pinch hit.	"I don't have any mixed feelings about that game," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. "We had several chances where we could have let it get away and we never did. That's a great win."	After Davis put the Orioles up 9-8 in the 12th, they added two more runs and appeared to have a pretty safe lead, but the Tigers tied it with RBI singles by Ian Kinsler, Miguel Cabrera and Alex Avila.	"We did a good job of coming back," Avila said. "A lot of times, when you're down 7-1, it can be tough, but guys continued to put good at-bats together."	Detroit led 1-0 in the third when J.J. Hardy started Baltimore's barrage with a solo homer. Manny Machado and Davis hit RBI doubles, and Welington Castillo added a two-run single to make it 5-1. The Orioles sent 11 batters to the plate in the inning.	Victor Martinez hit a two-run homer in the bottom of the third, and J.D. Martinez added a solo shot that same inning.	Detroit starter Matthew Boyd allowed seven runs and eight hits in 2 1/3 innings. Baltimore's Wade Miley permitted four runs and eight hits in five-plus innings.	J.D. Martinez drew four of Detroit's nine walks. Two of them were intentional, setting up the at-bats by Collins with the bases loaded.	CONTINGENCY PLAN	Both teams used six relievers in a game that lasted 5 hours, 19 minutes. The Orioles didn't have any relievers left after Bleier, but Showalter said he could have used right-hander Ubaldo Jimenez if need be. Jimenez is set to start Wednesday night.	ANSWERING THE BELL	Long before the game finally ended, left-hander Chad Bell pitched four scoreless innings for Detroit in relief of Boyd, helping the Tigers get back in it.	"The first inning he pitched, it looked like his command was a little off, but then he settled in," Detroit manager Brad Ausmus said. "He threw a harder slider today."	SLUGGING	Trumbo had four hits, and the middle of the Baltimore order -- Adam Jones, Machado, Trumbo and Davis -- went 13 for 26 with eight runs and seven RBI.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: Castillo was out with right shoulder tendinitis and had not played since April 30. He was activated from the disabled list before the game and had three hits.	UP NEXT	Orioles: Baltimore sends Jimenez (1-1) to the mound Wednesday night against the Tigers. Showalter said Dylan Bundy would have been able to start Wednesday on regular rest if Jimenez had been needed Tuesday.	Tigers: RHP Michael Fulmer (4-1) tries to build on an impressive outing last Thursday, when he allowed a run and three hits in seven innings against the Los Angeles Angels.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	---	Follow Noah Trister at www.Twitter.com/noahtrister	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

MIAMI -- The Houston Astros are playing so well they needed unbeaten ace Dallas Keuchel for only five innings Tuesday night.	The left-hander became the first seven-game winner in the majors despite his shortest outing this season, and Houston beat the sinking Miami Marlins 12-2.	Keuchel (7-0) threw only 70 pitches before departing with a 10-2 lead achieved in part thanks to a pair of two-run homers by Jake Marisnick .	"I don't like to pitch five innings," Keuchel said, "but if there's a big lead and I've got a chance to get a win, I'll take that. I'm on pace for a lot of innings, so today was a good chance to save a few bullets."	Keuchel is known to argue when he's taken out of games, but this time he offered little protest, manager A.J. Hinch said.	"He always wants to pitch, but he understands," Hinch said. "He's on board with what we're doing, and we have the big picture in mind when we do stuff like this."	The big picture is rosy for the Astros (28-12), who own the best record in the majors and have won six series in a row.	The last-place Marlins (14-24) are headed the other way, losing 16 of 20. They're 1-7 on their homestand going into Wednesday's finale.	"You're tired of these kind of games," manager Don Mattingly said.	Tom Koehler (1-2) gave up eight runs in three innings and was optioned to Triple-A New Orleans after the game. He won 30 games from 2014-16 but has an ERA of 7.04 this year.	"I've thrown a lot of innings in the big leagues and I've had success," Koehler said. "But this wasn't getting it done. ... I'm just going to make sure everything's right, work on my delivery, and get back to what was making me successful in the past. And try to make this stint as short as possible."	Marisnick led the Astros' 14-hit attack and tripled his season RBI total to six. Both of his homers caromed off the home run sculpture at Marlins Park.	"I wasn't aiming for it," he said.	Marisnick also hit his first double of the year and acknowledged some satisfaction in having a good game against the team that traded him in 2014.	"It was a pretty cool feeling," he said.	Brian McCann also had four RBI .	Keuchel allowed two runs, increasing his ERA to 1.84. Two infield hits, a wild pitch and two errors -- one by Keuchel -- helped the Marlins score twice in the first.	Keuchel's description of the inning?	"As colorful as Miami," he said. "Luckily, I settled down and made some good pitches."	Miami went hitless for the final 6 2/3 innings against Keuchel and two relievers, and totaled just four hits.	The Astros used five singles to score three times in the first inning. Koehler issued three consecutive two-out walks in the second, and McCann hit the next pitch for a three-run double.	The Astros' run total was a season high. They rank second in the AL in runs.	"Pretty impressive," Hinch said. "We kept coming at them and coming at them. We hit and hit and hit."	GLOVE WORK	Keuchel made a throwing error in the first but also helped himself with the glove . He leads the majors in groundball outs, and the three-time Gold Glove winner had a fielding role in seven of the 15 outs he recorded. He had six assists, all on plays scored 1-3, and added a putout scored 4-1.	MARLINS MOVE	The Marlins claimed INF Christian Colon off waivers from the Royals and designated INF Steve Lombardozzi for assignment. Colon is a .263 hitter in 125 games over the past four years.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: 2B Jose Altuve had a hit, two walks and scored twice one night after being hit by a pitch on the left hand.	Marlins: RHP Dan Straily (bruised right arm) said he's optimistic he'll make his next start as scheduled. He was hit by a line drive Monday and left the game after five innings. ... LHP Wei-Yin Chen (tired arm) underwent an MRI and the team was awaiting results. He's expected to be shut down for at least two weeks.	UP NEXT	The Astros will try for their first three-game sweep of the season Wednesday afternoon when RHP Lance McCullers Jr. (3-1, 2.98 ERA) starts against RHP Jose Urena (1-1, 1.98).	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  It took Yu Darvish a bit longer than expected to get his 50th career win.	The Texas Rangers didn't bank on taking this much time to reach .500, either.	Darvish reached his milestone with nine strikeouts in seven innings, and the Rangers beat the Philadelphia Phillies 5-1 on Tuesday night to stretch the majors' longest active winning streak to seven games.	"I think we're doing a great job with the starters," Darvish said through an interpreter. "But at the same time, as a team, we're playing good baseball. That's why we're winning games."	Darvish became the sixth Japanese pitcher to reach 50 career victories. In his 109th start, he joined Hideo Nomo (123), Hiroki Kuroda (79), Hisashi Iwakuma (63), Daisuke Matsuzaka (56) and Tomo Ohka (51).	Darvish likely would have reached the mark sooner, but he missed the entire 2015 season and some of 2016 after having Tommy John surgery.	On Tuesday, Darvish mixed up his pitches and continued his dominance in interleague play, lowering his career ERA to 2.19 in 14 starts against the National League.	"Arguably the best slider in baseball, in my opinion," Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said. "When that's the first time a team sees him, it's got to be tough, especially the way he located it."	Darvish used his slider and curveball in key moments.	After cruising through the first five innings, he ran into trouble in the sixth inning, but struck out Freddy Galvis on a slider and Odubel Herrera on a curveball. He preserved a two-run lead by striking out Brock Stassi on a curveball with runners at first and second after he allowed his only run on an RBI single by Freddy Galvis in the seventh inning.	"I thought that good use of all his pitches tonight," Rangers manager Jeff Banister said. "He really got the curveball in play tonight for some big strikeouts."	Nomar Mazara had a solo homer in the first, and Mike Napoli hit a two-run shot in the eighth. Napoli, who came in hitting .165, went 3 for 3.	Closer Matt Bush struck out one in a perfect ninth after Napoli's homer eliminated a save situation.	Phillies starter Jared Eickhoff (0-4) struck out eight and allowed seven hits in his first career start against the franchise that drafted him in 2011. Eickhoff was traded to Philadelphia in a deal that included LHP Cole Hamels in 2015.	Robinson Chirinos had an RBI groundout in the second inning and Jonathan Lucroy had an RBI double in the fifth to give the Rangers a 3-0 lead after Mazara's homer.	Texas' win streak is the second-longest in the big leagues this season. The Yankees won eight straight games between April 9 and 17.	"We didn't start the year how we wanted to and we all knew that," Mazara said. "We were struggling at the beginning. Everybody's going to struggle at some point in the season."	CENTER FIELD SHUFFLE	Banister said he'll give Jared Hoying a couple games in center field after Carlos Gomez (right hamstring) was put on the disabled list and is expected to miss four to six weeks. Hoying was called up on Tuesday from Triple-A and went 0 for 3.	"I'm sure that there is still part of Jared that wants to show he's a major league player," Banister said. "Don't know that he's ever had an opportunity to have consistent at-bats. He's probably going to get that opportunity now."	SMART CHALLENGES	The Rangers won a challenge in the fifth inning when Delino DeShields was called out at first on a pickoff throw to first base. After a 70-second review, DeShields was ruled safe, and he then scored on Lucroy's double.	Texas is now 11 for 16 on challenges this season and has won the last six.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: RHP Aaron Nola will return to the Phillies rotation Sunday against Pittsburgh. Nola (lower-back strain) pitched 6 1/3 scoreless innings in a Triple-A rehab start Monday.	Rangers: Texas moved INF Hanser Alberto (right shoulder) to the 60-day disabled list Tuesday to make room for Hoying on the 40-man roster. ... Banister said 3B Adrian Beltre (calf strain) jogged in the outfield at 50 percent and took batting practice.	UP NEXT	Phillies: RHP Zach Eflin is making his sixth start and has yet to pick up a decision since returning from a knee injury April 18.	Rangers: RHP Andrew Cashner is winless in six starts with a 2.43 ERA.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

Cubs manager Joe Maddon takes to the podium after his 1,000th career managerial win with a glass of red wine and explains where the wine came from. (0:44)	CHICAGO -- Cubs manager Joe Maddon paired his 1,000th win with a glass of red wine made by Big Smooth Wines out of Lodi, California.	It was a nod to his past on a very sweet night.	Slumping sluggers Anthony Rizzo and Kyle Schwarber homered to help the Cubs beat the Cincinnati Reds 9-5 on Tuesday, handing a landmark victory to their beloved manager.	Maddon became the eighth active manager with at least 1,000 wins. He started his coaching career in the minors with the Angels and served as the interim manager of the major league club on two occasions before taking over in Tampa Bay. He is in his third season with the Cubs and guided them to a World Series title last year.	"I've seen a lot of different methods," Maddon said with the glass of wine waiting on the table in front of him. "I've been taught well, and I really want to say, it's 1,000 wins. Other guys have done it, but to the players that have been a part of this, I want to say thank you -- because you don't do this without really good players. You don't."	The 63-year-old Maddon, known for his eccentric tricks over the years, such as mariachi bands and impromptu petting zoos, also thanked his coaches before he was toasted by the team in a room off the main clubhouse at Wrigley Field.	"He's a great manager, a great one to play for, and we know that we have his back and he'll have ours," Schwarber said.	Ian Happ hit his second home run in his third major league game, and Addison Russell also went deep as Chicago returned to .500 after a lackluster road trip. National League MVP Kris Bryant added two hits in his first appearance after missing three games because of an illness.	Joey Votto, Zack Cozart and Tucker Barnhart connected for Cincinnati on a warm and windy night. Bronson Arroyo (3-3) was hit hard in five innings, allowing five runs and eight hits.	"It was one of those days, man," Arroyo said. "It's a hard place to pitch when the wind's blowing the way it is, and their guys just did a better job of keeping the ball in the park than we did."	The Cubs (19-19) had dropped seven of nine, including four of their past six at division leaders Colorado and St. Louis.	Schwarber's continued trouble in the leadoff spot and the shaky performance so far by the rotation had created some angst for a fan base expecting more of the same after Chicago's drought-busting crown last year, but no one seemed a bit worried around the team.	Willson Contreras had two hits and two RBIs, and John Lackey (4-3) pitched into the sixth inning in the opener of a 10-game homestand.	"Felt like we all put in pretty good at-bats today," Schwarber said.	Schwarber was hitless in 17 at-bats before he belted a drive in the second inning that landed near the back of the bleachers in right. He singled down the third-base line in the sixth and scored on Happ's bases-loaded walk for a 7-3 lead.	After Votto's two-run shot got Cincinnati (19-19) within two in the seventh, Russell went deep in the bottom half, and Rizzo added his seventh home run of the season in the eighth. Rizzo went 2-for-16 on Chicago's road trip.	"We just couldn't contain them at any point in that ballgame," Reds manager Bryan Price said.	WORTH NOTING	The Reds will promote left-hander Amir Garrett from Triple-A Louisville to start Thursday's series finale against the Cubs. Right-hander Lisalverto Bonilla will start Friday in the opener of three-game set at home against Colorado. Garrett is 3-2 with a 4.25 ERA in six starts with Cincinnati this year. ... The Reds claimed first baseman/outfielder Peter O'Brien off waivers from Kansas City and optioned him to Louisville. Left-hander Brandon Finnegan, out with a shoulder injury, was transferred to the 60-day disabled list to make room on the 40-man roster.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: Price said he is hoping right-hander Tim Adleman will be able to make his next start Saturday against the Rockies. Adleman left Sunday's 8-3 loss at San Francisco with a neck strain. "We will have to monitor it to make sure we can comfortably allow him to start that game without having to go through what he went through last time," Price said.	Cubs: Outfielder Jason Heyward took live batting practice on the field. Heyward is on the 10-day disabled list with a sore knuckle on his right hand. ... Second baseman Ben Zobrist (back) was out of the starting lineup, but Maddon said Zobrist could have played. "His back is still not 100 percent," Maddon said. "I just want to be very careful with him, quite frankly." ... Outfielder Jon Jay (back) pinch hit in the seventh and lined out to center.	UP NEXT	Right-handers Kyle Hendricks of the Cubs and Scott Feldman of the Reds face each other Wednesday night. Hendricks (2-2, 3.40 ERA) is 1-1 with a 1.52 ERA in his past four starts. Feldman (2-3, 3.59) also is pitching well, going 1-0 with a 1.13 ERA in his past two outings.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  CC Sabathia's eyes light up whenever he sees the outfield fountains at Kauffman Stadium.	His performance usually picks up, too.	The Yankees' big left-hander carried a shutout into the seventh inning Tuesday night, getting a three-run homer from Gary Sanchez and a two-run shot from Chris Carter in support, and New York went on to rout the Kansas City Royals 7-1 in the opener of their three-game series.	Pitching on six days' rest, Sabathia (3-2) struck out five and walked two over 6 2/3 innings to win for the first time since April 15. And the fact he got back on track in Kansas City should come as no surprise: He is 13-5 in 21 career starts there, matching the record for most wins by a visitor.	"I love pitching here," Sabathia said, smiling. "It's my favorite park."	Sabathia was never in trouble until the seventh, when Alex Gordon's infield single loaded the bases with two outs. Tyler Clippard came in and fanned Whit Merrifield to escape the jam, then handled the eighth before Jonathan Holder allowed a run in the ninth.	That preserved the solid effort by Sabathia, who had allowed 22 runs in his last four starts.	"He was pretty frustrated with the way things were going," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said, "not pitching the way he did earlier this season. So I think this was big."	Sanchez drilled an 0-1 pitch from Jason Hammel (1-5) to center field with nobody out in the third, and Carter pounded a 1-1 pitch to almost the same place with two down in the fourth.	"I've got to do a better job of keeping the ball in the park," Hammel said. "Both the guys that hit it out are strong boys. They're mistake killers."	Jacoby Ellsbury and Matt Holliday also drove in runs against the Royals' bullpen, part of a 13-hit outburst that sent the Yankees to their ninth win in the last 11 meetings with Kansas City.	It was another dismal night for Hammel, who allowed seven runs over seven innings in his last start against Tampa Bay. The right-hander yielded five runs on nine hits and a walk in six innings this time, and has served up six home runs in his last four outings.	"It was two balls that left the yard that hurt me," he said. "I'm trying to stay positive and just continue to work. I've got to find a way to do a better job of establishing a better tone early."	Meanwhile, Sabathia was getting plenty of help from his defense.	Alcides Escobar twice lined out to third baseman Chase Headley, including a hot shot leading off the game. Carter made a couple of nifty plays at first base, and left fielder Brett Gardner threw out Jorge Soler in the fifth inning as he tried to stretch a single.	The Yankees' dominant pitching and defense came after the Royals had won three one-run games in a sweep of Baltimore, capped by a season-best 14 hits in the finale on Sunday.	"We had guys hit the ball on the nose," Royals manager Ned Yost said, "and not much to show for it."	STATS AND STREAKS	Sanchez has hit all three of his homers on the road this season. ... Carter has 13 career hits against Kansas City. Six of them are home runs. ... The Royals were held to one run or fewer for the 13th time, most in the majors. ... Gordon had his first multi-hit game since April 9.	SILENCE FOR STEVE	There was a moment of silence before the game for Steve Palermo, the umpire whose career ended when he was shot trying to break up a robbery in 1991. Palermo, who lived in the Kansas City area, died last weekend at age 67. He had been ill with cancer.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals RHP Ian Kennedy will throw a bullpen Wednesday and hopes to make his next start Saturday. Kennedy has been dealing with a strained right hamstring.	UP NEXT	Yankees RHP Michael Pineda tries to keep rolling when he gets the ball Wednesday night on five days' rest. Pineda is 3-1 with a 2.63 ERA over his last six outings.	Royals LHP Jason Vargas makes his ninth career start against the Yankees, still searching for his first win. He is 5-1 with a 1.01 ERA this season, but 0-5 with a 6.53 ERA vs. New York.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

ST. LOUIS -- Mookie Betts hasn't felt great about his performances lately, even if the results for the Boston Red Sox right fielder look just fine.	Betts homered and drove in two runs to back six quality innings by Eduardo Rodriguez and the Red Sox beat the St. Louis Cardinals 6-3 on Tuesday night in the opener of a two-game interleague series.	"I feel OK," Betts said. "I had a good first at-bat and then not really another good one after that. So I'm just trying to put it all together."	Betts went 1 for 5 and is batting .371 (13 for 35) with five homers and five doubles over his last eight games. He won AL player of the week Monday, but still says he is searching for better rhythm.	"I just feel like I'm not really consistent yet," Betts said. "I have a good game and then a couple bad ones. That's part of the game. It's going to take a while."	Jackie Bradley Jr. had two of Boston's six hits, including a home run, and Rodriguez (2-1) allowed three runs and five hits. Rodriguez walked two, struck out five and threw a season-high 110 pitches.	"Overall he was solid," Red Sox manager John Farrell said. "We played a strong game, I think, in every phase here tonight. Particularly some very good defensive plays."	St. Louis made three errors and lost for just the second time in 10 games. Lance Lynn (4-2) gave up four runs, two earned, and three hits in six innings, striking out four and walking one.	"I gave up two early with the homers and the team fought back and gave me a lead and I gave it away," Lynn said. "They gave me a chance to win and I didn't get it done."	Betts began the game with his seventh homer and 10th career leadoff shot, tying Jacoby Ellsbury for the franchise record. Bradley added a solo homer in the second for a 2-0 lead.	Craig Kimbrel pitched a scoreless ninth for his 12th save in 13 chances.	In the third inning, St. Louis' Dexter Fowler smacked an RBI double off the left field wall, and Tommy Pham and Matt Carpenter followed with sacrifice flies.	The Red Sox scored twice in the fifth after a leadoff walk and an error. Bradley scored on an RBI groundout by Betts. Deven Marrero, who reached on an error by Jedd Gyorko, scored on Dustin Pedroia's single to center to make it 4-3.	Boston scored twice in the eighth, on Christian Vazquez's sac fly and then a dropped fly ball by Pham that was the third Cardinals error.	VELAZQUEZ TO START THURSDAY	Farrell said right-hander Hector Velazquez will be called up from Triple-A to start Thursday at Oakland. Velazquez, whose contract was purchased from the Mexican League in February, is 2-1 with a 1.55 ERA in five starts at Pawtucket.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: LHP Drew Pomeranz, who left his start Sunday because of tightness in his left triceps, is scheduled to throw a bullpen session Wednesday. ... INF Pablo Sandoval (knee sprain) could begin a rehab assignment Friday. ... LHP David Price (left elbow strain) will make a rehab start for Pawtucket on Friday.	Cardinals: General manager John Mozeliak said INF Jhonny Peralta (upper respiratory) could be activated Friday and RF Stephen Piscotty (right hamstring) sometime over the weekend. ... LHP Tyler Lyons (right intercostal strain) is expected to make one more rehab start. ... RHP John Gant (groin) has been activated from the DL and optioned to Triple-A Memphis.	UP NEXT	Red Sox: RHP Rick Porcello (2-5, 4.01) is 1-1 with a 1.80 ERA in three road starts this season.	Cardinals: RHP Mike Leake (4-2, 1.94) is coming off a 3-2 loss to the Cubs in which he allowed two runs on five hits in six innings.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

PHOENIX --  When the Arizona Diamondbacks made a mistake on the bases, they ended up stealing home.	That's how things are going for the New York Mets these days.	Paul Goldschmidt stole home when New York botched a rundown, and Yasmany Tomas hit another home run against the reeling Mets to help Arizona hang on for a 5-4 victory Tuesday night.	Tomas has gone deep in five consecutive meetings with the Mets, who matched a season high with their sixth straight defeat.	"Nice to see Yaz hit a couple of balls very hard to the right side of the diamond. The one ball exploded off his bat when he hit a home run," Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said.	Gregor Blanco had a two-run single for the Diamondbacks, now 6-1 in their last seven games against New York. Of their 23 wins this season, 17 have come at home.	A four-run third inning gave the Diamondbacks a 4-1 lead before Tomas homered into the pool in right field in the sixth to make it 5-2. The solo shot loomed large when Rene Rivera hit a two-run homer in the seventh off ace Zack Greinke to cut the margin to one.	Greinke (5-2) allowed four runs and five hits while striking out eight in 6 2/3 innings to beat the Mets for the fifth straight time. He got help from relievers Andrew Chafin, Archie Bradley and Fernando Rodney, who combined to hold New York hitless the rest of the way.	Rodney worked a 1-2-3 ninth for his 10th save.	"Flawless defense, scored five runs. That took care of most everything," Greinke said.	Tommy Milone (1-1) lasted 5 2/3 innings in his second start for the Mets. He gave up five runs and six hits.	Slumping outfielder Curtis Granderson homered and had two RBI for New York.	"It's what we're going through right now," manager Terry Collins said. "When things aren't going good, nothing goes good."	The Mets took advantage of uncharacteristic wildness from Greinke in the second when he walked Rivera and Granderson to force in a run.	The Diamondbacks took the lead with four runs off Milone in the third. Blanco singled in two with one out, and after Goldschmidt was intentionally walked with two outs, Chris Owings made the Mets pay with an RBI single.	The Mets messed up a rundown when they had Owings hung up between first and second. First baseman Lucas Duda's throw home to try to get Goldschmidt breaking from third bounced away from Rivera.	"It was a mix-up between the coaches. I don't want to sound like we were geniuses. That was not the play," Lovullo said. "It was blind luck. That is not how we run it. We got lucky."	Goldschmidt was credited with stealing home, and his run made it 4-1. New York has allowed at least four runs in an inning in six straight games.	"Seeing C.O. (Owings) stop right there and knowing there was two outs, you have to take at least some bit of a chance to try to get to home," Goldschmidt said.	Duda said he has not been playing well for a week.	"I think it boils down to, I just made a poor throw. I've got to make a better throw. That's on me," he said. "I've got to clean it up."	Granderson entered hitting .148 and batted eighth for the first time since 2011. He hit a solo homer in the fifth.	Tomas, who connected for the second straight night, has eight home runs this season. He has six homers and 14 RBI in 11 career games against the Mets.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: SS Asdrubal Cabrera was placed on the 10-day disabled list with a sprained left thumb, retroactive to Sunday. "I like to play. I like to be there. But it's something that I don't feel like I can help the team like that," Cabrera said. "The best idea for the team and for me is to try to be 100 percent." ... LHP Steven Matz (elbow inflammation) and RHP Seth Lugo (elbow inflammation) are scheduled to pitch Thursday for Class A St. Lucie.	Diamondbacks: OF David Peralta pinch hit for the second consecutive night. He has been out of the starting lineup for two days due to glute tightness.	UP NEXT	Mets: In the series finale Wednesday afternoon, RHP Matt Harvey returns to the mound where he made his major league debut in July 2012. Harvey (2-3, 5.62 ERA) has lost three straight outings but is 3-1 in four career starts against Arizona. "The critical part is getting Matt Harvey going, make no mistake about it," Collins said. "We come out of tomorrow's game and we're excited about what we see out of Matt Harvey, we'll take it."	Diamondbacks: LHP Patrick Corbin (3-4, 4.17) is 3-1 in five home starts this season but 0-3 in his career against the Mets.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Cameron Maybin batted leadoff for the first time in an Angels uniform. He seemed right at home there.	Maybin had a career-high five hits, including a tying double in the 11th inning, and Albert Pujols singled home the winning run moments later to give Los Angeles a 7-6 victory over the Chicago White Sox on Tuesday night.	"I don't know that it's the leadoff spot. Hitting in front of Mike Trout is not a bad spot to hit," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "Cam was comfortable all night. That's the way this guy can hit and swing the bat. It was a good breakout game for him."	Chicago erased a three-run deficit in the ninth and went ahead 6-5 on Tim Anderson's solo homer in the top of the 11th. But it was the Angels who pulled off the final comeback.	Andrelton Simmons singled leading off the bottom half against closer David Robertson (2-1), and Ben Revere singled with one out before Maybin drove a double to left-center that tied it 6-all.	After an intentional walk to Trout loaded the bases, Pujols singled to deep center field for his third RBI of the night. He also had a two-run single in the third.	"As soon as I hit the ball, I knew the game was over," Pujols said. "Just did my job."	Four home runs shy of 600, Pujols moved into sole possession of 11th place on baseball's career RBI list with 1,847, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. He broke a tie with Hall of Famer Carl Yastrzemski.	Mel Ott is 10th with 1,864 RBI.	Anderson played his first game after missing four to attend the funeral of a good friend. He connected off winner Yusmeiro Petit (1-0), who was pitching his third inning of relief.	Maybin doubled in the first inning, singled in the third and fourth, and doubled again in a two-run seventh. He was 5 for 6 with two RBI and two runs, raising his batting average 34 points to .214.	"If there's anybody here that deserves it, it's him," Pujols said. "He's been putting good swings. That's all you can do. Sooner or later, things are going to fall."	Scioscia batted Maybin leadoff against left-hander Derek Holland. Yunel Escobar was starring in the leadoff role for the Angels, but he went on the disabled list with a hamstring injury Monday.	JC Ramirez pitched seven strong innings for the Angels, allowing two runs and five hits. He gave up a two-run homer to Yolmer Sanchez in the sixth but retired his next five batters.	"I used my fastball a lot more," Ramirez said. "I'm pitching for contact now. It's nice to have strikeouts, but it's better when you go deep in the games. Today I threw seven innings with 85 pitches, and that's really good for me."	Todd Frazier tied it in the ninth with a pop-fly single that scored two runs. David Hernandez failed to get an out in the ninth for the Angels as they wasted a 5-2 lead. He allowed three runs and four hits on 15 pitches.	Holland yielded three runs and seven hits in six innings. A double play in the sixth helped him finish on a solid note.	"Anybody under the sun probably thought we were out of it until we came back in that wild ninth inning," White Sox manager Rick Renteria said. "All in all, these guys battled. In the end, like I told them, they shouldn't feel down about the end. They put themselves in a position to potentially win that ballgame. We just fell a little short."	KEPT IN THE PARK	On one of his three scheduled bobblehead giveaway nights at Angel Stadium this season, Trout went 0 for 3 with three walks. He fell short in his attempt to become the first Angels player to homer in five straight games since Bobby Bonds in 1977.	LONG-AWAITED RETURN	Gregory Infante pitched a scoreless eighth for the White Sox on Monday, his first major league outing since his debut with Chicago in 2010. He was called on again Tuesday but got only one out and loaded the bases. Still, his return to the big leagues has been heartwarming. "It was worth it. Before this season, I was talking with my wife and saying this year would probably be my last chance," Infante said through a translator.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels RHP Mike Morin (neck tightness) is expected to throw to hitters this week.	UP NEXT	White Sox: RHP Miguel Gonzalez (3-3, 3.83 ERA) has allowed 14 earned runs in losing his last three starts. He's held Trout to a .158 average in 19 at-bats, but Trout's three hits against him have all been home runs.	Angels: RHP Matt Shoemaker (2-2, 4.50) had his best start of the season with six scoreless innings in a victory against his hometown team, the Tigers, on Friday. He is 1-2 with a 4.15 ERA in four career starts against the White Sox. He threw his first shutout in his last start against Chicago, at Angel Stadium in 2015.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.

SEATTLE --  With the Athletics on the verge of a fifth straight loss during an ugly road trip, Matt Joyce and Mark Canha made sure Oakland finished its ninth-inning rally this time.	Joyce hit a two-run homer and Canha added a three-run shot in a five-run ninth that sent the A's to a 9-6 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Tuesday night.	A day after a one-run loss to Seattle ended with Oakland leaving the bases loaded, the A's clubbed their way from behind in the final inning after squandering a 4-1 lead.	"When you go through streaks like this, you have to find some fight," Oakland manager Bob Melvin said. "We've been losing games by a defensive play, one pitch, little things during the whole stretch and at some point in time you have to overcome it."	Oakland led 4-1 going to the bottom of the seventh before a key two-run error helped Seattle pull even and Kyle Seager's solo home run in the eighth gave the Mariners a 5-4 lead. But with a struggling Edwin Diaz removed from the closer role earlier in the day, Steve Cishek was asked to get the final three outs for Seattle in just his second appearance of the season.	Cishek (0-1) was unable to finish the job, giving up a leadoff single to Rajai Davis and watching Joyce hit his fifth homer of the year to give Oakland the lead. Mark Rzepczynski took over and allowed Canha's first homer on a 3-2 pitch.	"Things felt like they were going really bad there for a second, and that really lifted us," Canha said.	The decision to let Cishek face the left-handed-hitting Joyce was debatable, with Rzepczynski warming up in the bullpen. Lefties began the day 1 for 24 against Rzepczynski this season, but it was the right-handed-hitting Canha that provided the knockout blow with a drive to left-center that bounced off the top of the wall and over.	"Putting Cishek in that spot, it's tough. He hasn't been back here a long time, but he's been out here before," Seattle manager Scott Servais said. "You are just hoping you can get through it, and unfortunately we just didn't get the final three outs."	Ryan Madson (1-3) got the win despite giving up Seager's homer.	Seattle's rally started an inning earlier when third baseman Ryon Healy's error on a potential inning-ending double play allowed two runs to score. Seattle loaded the bases with one out and Carlos Ruiz chopped a slow grounder to third. Healy shuffled to his left, but the grounder slid past his glove, between his legs and into left field to score a pair.	Jean Segura followed with a grounder to shortstop, and Oakland appeared to turn a double play that time. But after a replay review, Segura was ruled safe at first and Jarrod Dyson scored to make it 4-all.	"I don't know how that's overturned. I really don't," Melvin said.	STARTING OFF	Healy hit a 443-foot home run into the second deck in left field off Seattle starter Chase De Jong to give Oakland an early 2-1 lead, and the A's led 4-1 going to the seventh thanks largely to starter Andrew Triggs, who permitted only four hits.	Triggs rebounded after getting knocked in his previous start against the Mariners when he allowed six earned runs and failed to make it through the fifth inning. Triggs' only costly mistake this time came in the first when Nelson Cruz lined his 10th home run of the season into the seats in right-center to give Seattle a 1-0 advantage.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: Relief pitcher John Axford is likely to make two more rehab appearances with Triple-A Nashville before the A's consider activating the right-hander from the disabled list. Axford has yet to pitch in the majors this season due to a strained right shoulder, but could make his debut on Oakland's upcoming homestand.	Mariners: 2B Robinson Cano was the latest addition to the disabled list. Cano was placed on the 10-day DL with a strained quadriceps muscle. He's expected to return next week when Seattle heads out on a road trip.	UP NEXT	Athletics: Jesse Hahn (1-2) had a no-decision in his last start against Texas, throwing seven innings and allowing one run. He is 1-1 in three career starts vs. Seattle.	Mariners: Christian Bergman (0-1) makes his second start since being brought up from the minors. Bergman gave up three runs in five innings last weekend against Toronto.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

SAN DIEGO --  Eric Sogard is making the most of the second chance he's been given after injuries have sidelined some key members of the Milwaukee Brewers.	Sogard had a career-high four hits and drove in a run, and Jimmy Nelson struck out eight in six-plus innings and hit an RBI single to help the Brewers beat the San Diego Padres 6-2 on Tuesday night.	Sogard, a former Padres farmhand, was called up from Triple-A on Friday after Ryan Braun went on the disabled list, and made his first big league appearance since Oct. 2, 2015. He missed all of last season after having knee surgery.	"I'm definitely just grateful to be out there after missing a full year last year," Sogard said. "It puts a little different perspective on the game and allows me to go out and have some fun. Obviously after major surgery like that you never know what the future holds."	Sogard has come up big in his three starts. He homered both Friday night and Monday night, and then had his career night Tuesday. The Brewers played the last two games without third baseman Travis Shaw and first baseman Eric Thames. Sogard started at shortstop Monday night and at third base Tuesday night.	The key to coming back from the surgery was staying positive, Sogard said.	"I just continued to work at it. I've a great physical therapist who continued to get me better. It's been an interesting process to go through but I think it's made me better in the long run."	Sogard had one of six hits against lefty Clayton Richard in the first inning that helped the Brewers to a 5-0 lead. The Brewers had five straight hits with one out, including RBI singles by Jesus Aguilar and Domingo Santana, and a two-run double by Manny Pina. Sogard hit an RBI single with two outs.	Sogard doubled with two outs in the sixth and scored on Nelson's single to right.	"You bring a guy up and he steps in and he performs, it's a boost," manager Craig Counsell said. "It really is. When you've got guys of the caliber we've got out right now, and somebody steps in there ... it makes you appreciate the depth of our group, really."	Counsell said the big first inning "does a lot for your starting pitcher as much as anything, that he's got some breathing room."	Nelson (2-2) gave up two runs and seven hits, with one walk. He allowed Wil Myers' solo homer to straightaway center field leading off the sixth and then was chased by consecutive doubles by rookie Hunter Renfroe and Matt Szczur opening the seventh.	Richard (2-5) lost his third straight decision, over five starts. He allowed six runs and 10 hits in six innings, struck out seven and walked none.	"I didn't throw the ball terrible, just a few pulled changeups and that really hurt," Richard said. "It  seemed like we were just off on a few balls, unfortunately it was too much of a hole to get out of."	Manager Andy Green said the Brewers "were lifting them just enough to get them into the outfield. A couple unfortunate circumstances for Clayton which probably normally gets out of there with two runs and then it's still a close ballgame. We weren't able to hold them there though."	Renfroe tied the club record with an outfield assist in three straight games when he threw out Sogard trying to score on a liner to right by Keon Broxton to end the fourth. Sogard was aboard on a double and advanced on an error.	Santana threw out Szczur trying to score on Manuel Margot's fly to right to end the seventh.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: Thames has strep throat and missed his second straight game. "He's pretty miserable," Counsell said. "He's improved today for sure. Hopefully tomorrow he takes a big step forward. He's got some solid antibiotics running through his system." ... Shaw didn't start due to a swollen index finger suffered Sunday.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Giants left-hander Ty Blach finally got his first win of the season and was quick to spread the credit around.	There was the defense, particularly rookie Christian Arroyo, who made a pair of stellar plays in his first start at second base. A timely home run by Brandon Belt and an even more clutch tiebreaking hit from Brandon Crawford helped, too.	Most importantly, Blach pointed to catcher Buster Posey's game plan, which worked out nicely in stretching San Francisco's winning streak to five.	"Buster does a great job behind the plate against these guys," Blach said after the Giants' 2-1 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Tuesday. "He knows these hitters so well, so just being able to know that you've got confidence in him, that makes it a lot easier for you."	Blach (1-2) pitched seven innings, spoiling Dodgers starter Rich Hill's return from the disabled list. Blach allowed one run, five hits and two walks with four strikeouts.	"He's one of those guys that's unflappable, he just keeps coming at you," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "He was on top of his game. He's just a good pitcher that knows what he's doing and he's got a little more stuff than he gets credit for."	Belt homered for the fourth time in six games and scored the deciding run on Crawford's single in the sixth, while Posey added two hits.	San Francisco improved to 5-1 on its homestand after a sluggish nine-game road trip when Bochy's ballclub won only three games.	"We've been playing really good team ball right now," Blach said. "It's fun to be able to keep that going."	Belt, who hit his eighth home run of the season leading off the fourth, singled against the shift to open the sixth. After Belt advanced on a wild pitch, Crawford followed with a single off Luis Avilan (0-1) to short right-center to give the Giants a 2-1 lead.	Hunter Strickland retired three batters and Derek Law pitched the ninth for his fourth save.	Chris Taylor hit his fourth home run of the season for Los Angeles.	Activated off the disabled list before the game after missing more than four weeks due to a blister on his finger, Hill got off to a shaky start in his first appearance since April 16.	The lefty hit leadoff man Denard Span in the batting helmet with a 73 mph curve on his fifth pitch of the first inning, then was called for a balk moments later. Hill settled down to get through five innings while allowing one run and six hits with six strikeouts.	"He pitched himself out of some traffic," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. "To give us 80-plus pitches, give us five innings, give up one run ... I thought that was a success."	BLACH-OUT THE DODGERS	Blach has been dominant in four career appearances against the Dodgers, giving up just three runs in 23 innings -- a 1.17 ERA. Blach has a 4.71 ERA against everyone else. "There's certain teams where certain styles work better," Blach said.	FLASHY ROOKIE	Arroyo has played primarily at third base since being called up from the minors on April 24 but made his first start at second base Tuesday and looked good there. Arroyo threw out Justin Turner at home in the fourth inning, then made a diving stop on Joc Pederson's grounder in the seventh and threw to first for the out.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: LHP Grant Dayton was optioned to Triple-A Oklahoma to make room for Hill.	Giants: Span was checked by head athletic trainer Dave Groeschner and remained in the game. ... Closer Mark Melancon is expected to come off the disabled list Friday when San Francisco opens a three-game series in St. Louis. Melancon did some light throwing before Tuesday's game after a 22-pitch bullpen a day earlier. ... 2B Joe Panik was not in the starting lineup.	UP NEXT	Left-hander Clayton Kershaw (6-2), who has a career 1.66 ERA in 38 appearances against San Francisco, starts for the Dodgers in the afternoon finale on Wednesday while the Giants counter with right-hander Johnny Cueto (4-2). Cueto outdueled Kershaw and got the win when the two teams played May 1.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

CLEVELAND -- For the first time in a year, the Rays didn't get run over on the road.	Corey Dickerson hit a three-run homer -- his third homer in two days -- and Alex Cobb controlled Cleveland over seven inning as Tampa Bay busted out the bats in a 7-4 win over the Indians on Wednesday to complete the Rays' most successful trip since last May.	Dickerson connected in the second inning off Josh Tomlin (2-5) and Logan Morrison hit a solo shot in the third for the free-swinging Rays, who hit a franchise-record 10 homers in the three-game series and went 4-2 on a swing through Boston and Cleveland -- two of the AL's toughest stops.	"We're coming out of here on a huge high," said Cobb, who threw 115 pitches -- his most since Tommy John surgery in 2014 -- on an unseasonably warm day. "We're pumped about the way we played on this road trip. We've done a good of putting things together."	Cobb (4-3) allowed three runs and six hits and retired the last eight batters he faced.	Jesus Sucre also homered for the Rays, who have 59 already this season.	"They might strike out quite a bit, but they're a pretty athletic bunch," Tomlin said. "I know they swing a lot, but they can find the barrel pretty good, too."	Indians rookie Bradley Zimmer hit his first career homer in the ninth off Alex Colome, and Jason Kipnis almost got one, but Rays center fielder Kevin Kiermaier robbed him with a leaping catch for the final out.	While the Rays found their swing on the road, Edwin Encarnacion remains in a hitting funk for Cleveland.	The slumping slugger struck out looking with the bases loaded in the third and again with one on in the fifth. Encarnacion, who signed a three-year, $60 million free agent contract -- the richest in team history -- is batting just .203 and in a 2 for 23 slide.	Encarnacion is also batting only .108 (4 for 37) with runners in scoring position.	"He's OK. He really is," Indians manager Terry Francona said. "He knows what's going on and what he's supposed to do and all that. He's OK and he's going to be OK, it's just not been the best six weeks. He'll get it."	After Dickerson homered twice in a five-homer barrage Tuesday Tampa Bay came out swinging against Tomlin, who struck out five straight before giving up three consecutive two-out hits -- the last an RBI double by Sucre.	Dickerson, who came in tied for the AL lead in hits, followed with his ninth homer, a towering shot into the right-field seats to make it 4-0.	ROCKY ROTATION	Tomlin's performance ballooned the ERA for Cleveland's starters to a league-high 5.17. In the last five games, Indians starters have a 9.14 ERA.	With ace Corey Kluber on the disabled list, there is some genuine concern about the starting staff, which is supposed to be the team's strongest unit.	"I don't think we've probably executed as well as we can," pitching coach Mickey Callaway said. "We probably haven't pitched to our strengths as well as we can, and I think some of the numbers show that. It's kind of perplexing when you look at, `How is this possible? This number doesn't usually correlate with what's going on over here.'	"We really need to simplify things, start pitching to our strengths a little bit more and make sure we navigate lineups the right way."	THE CATCH	Kiermaier ended the trip with a dazzling play, backing up to the wall and snagging Kipnis' shot.	"It felt really good to close out the game like that," he said. "Colome's my guy so I'm happy I was able to save him a run."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: Starting 2B Brad Miller (strained left abdominal muscle) missed his second straight game and will be examined by a doctor before Friday's series opener against the Yankees.	Indians: OF Abraham Almonte will be out for at least three weeks with a strained right biceps. There were initial fears he might need surgery, but the club said an MRI revealed "a high grade" strain. ... OF Austin Jackson ran the bases before the game. He's on the disabled list with a hyperextended left toe.	UP NEXT	Rays: Tampa will have its only day off in May before opening a three-game series at home Friday with RHP Erasmo Ramirez facing the Yankees. Ramirez just rejoined the rotation after Blake Snell was sent to the minors.	Indians: Cleveland begins a three-game series in Houston on Friday with Trevor Bauer making his 100th career start. The right-hander is 6-0 with a 2.61 ERA in six outings against the Astros.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

MIAMI -- The Miami Marlins are for sale, and their players aren't helping the team's market value.	Miami mustered just three hits against Lance McCullers and three relievers Wednesday afternoon to conclude a dismal homestand with a 3-0 loss to the Houston Astros.	The Marlins were outscored 22-4 in the series and head to California last in the NL East after going 1-8 on their homestand.	"It can't get any worse than what it is," said second baseman Dee Gordon, whose errant throw led to two unearned runs . "We've just got to find a way to get some wins."	The Marlins haven't been to the playoffs since 2003, and owner Jeffrey Loria has seen enough losing and wants to sell. He's negotiating with a group that includes former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former New York Yankees captain Derek Jeter, and another group led by businessman Tagg Romney, son of the former Republican nominee for president.	Meanwhile the Marlins keep losing, despite spring training talk of a playoff run. They're 14-25, and manager Don Mattingly said he's unsure whether the sale talk is a factor.	"It's something you know is there and looming," Mattingly said. "I don't know if it has any effect. I can't speak for guys."	They managed just three hits in six innings against McCullers , who paid tribute to the late Marlins ace Jose Fernandez and pitched like him, allowing no earned runs for the third start in a row to help Houston complete a three-game sweep.	McCullers (4-1) wore cleats with Fernandez's initials and uniform number. Their friendship began when they were high school pitchers in the Tampa area. Fernandez died in a boating accident last September.	"I know he is here in spirit," McCullers said. "And he would want me to go out there and pitch my game and in that way celebrate him and pitching. That's what I tried to focus on."	The Marlins went 10 2/3 innings without a hit over two games until J.T. Riddle singled leading off the fifth. McCullers retired the next three batters.	McCullers has allowed no earned runs in his past 20 1/3 innings, lowering his ERA to 2.65. Ken Giles pitched around a walk in the ninth for his 11th save.	Jose Altuve hit his first two triples of the year, doubled twice and had an RBI. George Springer hit a two-out, two-run single in the sixth.	The Astros (29-12) passed the quarter mark in their season with the best record in the majors. Their fourth consecutive win lifted them 17 games above .500 for the first time since 2004, and they head home after a 6-1 trip.	"It's hard not to like this trip," manager A.J. Hinch said. "It was in incredible display on how to win games."	Jose Urena (1-2), one of the few bright spots in Miami's battered rotation, lost despite limiting Houston to three runs, one earned, in 5 2/3 innings.	Gordon, trying for a forceout, made an errant nonchalant backhanded throw to second base on a routine grounder with two out in the sixth. Springer followed with a single for a 3-0 lead.	"That was a mental mistake on my part," Gordon said. "I've got to throw the ball to first. I can't let that happen. I just made a dumb play. It's my fault we lost the game."	That made it 17 defeats in the past 21 games for Miami. Mattingly said his players hang their heads after one bad play as if to say, "Here we go again."	"I think we do. That's any team though when you go through a tough stretch," Mattingly said. "But I don't know if I've ever been through one quite like this. This is extended. At some point we've just got to play better."	MARLINS MOVE	Before the game, the Marlins placed RHP Junichi Tazawa on the 10-day disabled list retroactive to May 16 with rib cartilage inflammation, and designated Mike Aviles for assignment. They added INF Christian Colon to the roster after claiming him off waivers from Kansas City, and recalled RHPs Brian Ellington and Odrisamer Despaigne from Triple-A New Orleans.	UP NEXT	Houston: Following a day off, RHP Charlie Morton (5-2, 3.97) is scheduled to start Friday for the Astros when they return home to open a three-game series against Cleveland.	Miami: RHP Edinson Volquez (0-5, 4.41) is scheduled to start for the Marlins when they begin a four-game series Thursday at the Dodgers. Miami swept a four-game series there last year.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

PHOENIX --  Chris Herrmann and the Diamondbacks made it another long day for the sinking New York Mets.	Herrmann homered off Rafael Montero leading off the 11th inning, giving the Diamondbacks a 5-4 victory on Wednesday and sending the Mets to their season-high seventh straight loss.	New York went 0-6 in Milwaukee and Arizona, the Mets' longest winless trip since 1999, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. At 16-23, New York dropped seven games under .500 for the first time September 2014. And Matt Harvey's winless streak stretched to six starts since April 11.	"It's very easy to unravel right now," New York manager Terry Collins said. "I will not let that happen here. We are not going to do that. We are going to stay together, play together. I will not let this team get down."	Montero (0-3) relieved to start the 11th, and Herrmann worked the count full, fouled off a pitch and connected on a belt-high fastball for his first game-ending home run in the major leagues.	"It's awesome, man," Herrmann said. "I haven't hit very many homers in my career. I hit a grand slam, but I don't think there's anything that compares to hitting a walk-off home run. It's something you dream about when you're a little kid, when I'm 6 years old playing out in the cul de sac hitting tennis balls."	As a catcher, Herrmann is no fan of extra innings.	"You get tired behind the plate, and my knees were starting to hurt a little bit," he said.	Herrmman's teammates doused him with a Gatoraid container of ice and water at the plate.	"To be honest, I didn't even feel it," Herrmann said.	Arizona finished its homestand 6-3 and is a major league-best 18-8 at home.	Tom Wilhelmsen (1-1) walked Matt Reynolds and Lucas Duda with two outs in the 11th before throwing a called third strike past Jose Reyes. Wilhelmsen gave up the tiebreaking home run in a 10-inning loss to Pittsburgh on Sunday.	Making his second start since a three-day suspension for failing to show up for a game, Harvey allowed three runs, six hits and four walks in 5 1/3 innings. He left with a 4-3 lead.	"Obviously, if I could go back and change a couple pitches I would," he said. "But overall I felt much better today. Probably the best I've felt in two years. Definitely a positive."	Collins said he "saw some bright things in Matt Harvey today."	Mets starters have gone 17 consecutive games without getting an out in the seventh inning, tying the club high set in 2002.	Jake Lamb's two-run homer in the third was the 11th home run in eight starts this season off Harvey, whose fastball reached 98 mph. After giving up a double to Paul Goldschmidt, Harvey struck out the Arizona slugger twice, on three pitches each time.	Diamondbacks starter Patrick Corbin allowed four runs and nine hits in six innings, and five pitchers combined for two-hit relief. The bullpen, an uncertainty entering the season, has been a strength.	"They've been huge pretty much all year," Corbin said. "Our offense is going to score eventually, so if they keep doing that we're going to win a lot of these games."	First-year manager Torey Lovullo said "the thing that stands out to me is they are one big unit, one cohesive unit that prides themselves on picking up one another."	Michael Conforto and Juan Lagares homered for the Mets. New York led 4-3 before Yasmany Tomas' RBI double in the seventh off Robert Gsellman, whose turn is being skipped in the rotation because of an off day.	"At that point, we felt very good about our chances," Lovullo said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: LHP Steven Matz was to make his first rehab appearance Thursday night for Class A St. Lucie. Matz has been on the DL all season with left elbow inflammation.	Diamondbacks: RF David Peralta was out of the starting lineup for the third straight game with right glute tightness but pinch hit for Corbin in the sixth and grounded into a forceout.	UP NEXT	Mets: New York opens a home series against the Angels on Friday with RHP Jacob deGrom (2-1, 4.07 ERA) starting. RHP Ricky Nolasco (2-2, 4.34) opens for Los Angeless.	Diamondbacks: RHP Taijuan Walker (3-3, 3.91) start's Friday's trip opener at San Diego, and RHP Jered Weaver (0-4, 6.05) is scheduled for the Padres.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Eventually, Johnny Cueto and Yasmani Grandal spoke civilly and worked out their differences as grown men: They each apologized before tension escalated.	Cueto thought Grandal was stealing signs at second base from San Francisco catcher Buster Posey after a first-inning double. Grandal figured Cueto was throwing at his head in the third out of frustration and retaliation.	Grandal said "it caught me by surprise" and insists that wasn't the case at all in the Dodgers' 6-1 victory behind Clayton Kershaw on Wednesday. Grandal said he was just trying to get ready to move "because I'm slow."	"We talked about it, we apologized to each other, so we're on good terms now I guess," Grandal said. "Let's not make it a bigger deal than it really is."	The benches cleared briefly after the top of the third when Cueto and Grandal exchanged words. It happened just after Cueto's high, inside pitch flew wildly past Posey, allowing another Dodgers run home for a 3-0 lead.	Los Angeles manager Dave Roberts said Cueto apparently also thought Corey Seager was relaying signs in the third with Grandal batting again, just before the wild pitch.	Grandal said there's no way he knew what was coming on his two-run double in the first and lone hit, even though he hit a low 0-2 cut fastball well below his knees.	"Whether we were or we weren't, obviously he was displeased by it and let us know," Roberts said without acknowledging whether his team was in fact stealing signs. "It's a part of the game, it's part of baseball."	Cueto and Grandal made their apologies when Cueto came to bat in the bottom of the third and Grandal was behind the plate.	"He said, 'Sorry for the misunderstanding. Let's just move on,'" Cueto said. "I'm not going to use that as an excuse, but they were relaying signs."	Kershaw took a share of the major league lead with his seventh win and earned career victory No. 20 against the rival Giants. Kershaw (7-2) struck out five in seven shutout innings and retired his first 10 batters before Justin Ruggiano's fourth-inning single. Kershaw moved into a tie with Houston's Dallas Keuchel for most wins this season.	Yasiel Puig singled in a pair of runs in the sixth as the Dodgers jumped on Cueto (4-3), who lost for the first time at home this season.	Kershaw allowed three hits and didn't walk a batter for the fourth time in 2017 as the Dodgers snapped their three-game skid and ended the Giants' season-best five-game winning streak.	Kershaw's 20th victory against the Giants came in his 39th outing and 38th start of the rivalry. He is 12-4 with a 1.29 ERA at AT&T Park. He has allowed one or fewer walks in all but one of his starts.	Eduardo Nunez hit his first home run of the season in the ninth against former Giants reliever Sergio Romo before he finished the 2-hour, 37-minute game.	Cueto, who beat Kershaw and the Dodgers on May 1, allowed more than three earned runs for the first time in five starts and just the third in nine outings. Cueto lost for only the sixth time in 25 starts against the NL West since joining the Giants before the 2016 season and just the first time in six starts at AT&T Park since a defeat against the Diamondbacks here last Aug. 30.	Giants rookie Christian Arroyo started at shortstop, his third infield spot in as many days after playing third Monday and second Tuesday night.	WALL OF FAME FOR BONDS	The Giants are adding home run king Barry Bonds' name to their Wall of Fame, with a plaque to be unveiled July 8. Bonds, a seven-time NL MVP, is working for the club again as a special adviser.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: RHP Brandon McCarthy will pitch Sunday against the Marlins as Kenta Maeda gets a little more time to recover from a tight left hamstring that landed him on the disabled list. ... INF Logan Forsythe (broken right big toe) and 1B Adrian Gonzalez (back) each were scheduled to play rehab games again Wednesday night with Class A Rancho Cucamonga before being re-evaluated Thursday, manager Dave Roberts said.	Giants: The Giants activated closer Mark Melancon from the 10-day DL after he missed time with a strain near his pitching elbow. "He's adamant that he's ready to go," manager Bruce Bochy said. "He's our closer, why wouldn't we want to go ahead and activate him?" ... 1B Brandon Belt had the day off as Michael Morse started in his place before Posey moved from catcher to first.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: LHP Hyun-Jin Ryu goes for his seventh win of the year when the Dodgers return home to host Miami in a four-game set.	Giants: After Thursday's day off, lefty Matt Moore (2-4, 5.67 ERA) starts Friday at St. Louis having allowed five or more runs in four of his first eight starts.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PITTSBURGH --  Gerrit Cole spent the last six weeks stringing together dominant performance after dominant performance with little to show for it, thanks to a Pittsburgh Pirates offense that always seemed to sputter whenever their ace's turn in the rotation came up.	Yet Cole tried to stay upbeat, stressing that if he kept doing his job eventually the lineup would, too. Eventually turned into Wednesday night, when Cole shut down the best offense in the majors and the Pirates broke out late in a 6-1 victory over the Washington Nationals.	Cole (2-4) allowed one run on three hits , walked two and struck out three in seven efficient innings to win for the first time in a month. Josh Bell hit a three-run homer off Jacob Turner (2-2) in the sixth and Andrew McCutchen went 2 for 4 with two RBI and two stolen bases as Pittsburgh slowed the National League's hottest team.	"We hung in there, played really good defense and kept them off the board so we could strike first," Cole said. "Josh with the big swing and Andrew with the dagger late. The team played a great game."	Washington came in leading the majors in runs, batting average and doubles but couldn't get it going against Cole and two relievers. The Nationals' three hits were a season low. Bryce Harper and Ryan Zimmerman, who began the day with the top two batting averages in the majors, combined to go 0 for 8.	"If you start staring at the batting averages and the names on the back of the jerseys, it can be a little overwhelming," Cole said. "But you just have to stick with the process and control what you can control."	Washington managed just one hit -- a bloop single by Jose Lobaton in the third -- and three baserunners through the first six innings as Cole kept them off balance. He struck out three and walked two, his lone hiccup coming on Brian Goodwin's RBI double in the seventh.	"He had everything working tonight and it was the fifth or sixth inning before we kind of went `what happened?" Washington manager Dusty Baker said of Cole.	Turner pitched into the sixth inning in the majors for just the second time since 2014, and Pittsburgh finally got going. John Jaso walked leading off the sixth and Turner hit David Freese with one out. Bell drove a 3-1 offering 398 feet for his eighth homer, the most by a rookie in the National League.	Turner gave up three runs on four hits with four walks and a strikeout in 5 1/3 innings.	"Obviously, Bell hit the home run, everybody is going to look at that," Turner said. "How those guys got on base, stuff like that can't happen. I've got to be better in that situation."	The Pirates added on in the seventh, with McCutchen's drive to the wall in right scoring two and giving the five-time All-Star a bit of redemption a night after being pulled as part of a double switch in the eighth with Pittsburgh down just two runs. McCutchen also swiped multiple bases in the same game for the first time in three years.	"That's what happens when I get on base more than once," McCutchen said after bumping his average from .208 to .214. "I can do that. The more I started to get on base, the more opportunity I had to be able to do that."	KANG UPDATE	A South Korean court upheld a suspended prison sentence for Pirates infielder Jung Ho Kang over a drunken driving conviction, a ruling that may complicate his plans to rejoin the team for the baseball season.	An official from the Seoul Central District Court said Thursday it dismissed Kang's appeal of a suspended two-year prison sentence over charges of fleeing the scene after crashing a car into the guardrail while driving drunk. The court official didn't want to be named, citing office rules.	Kang had sought to lower the punishment to a fine. His lawyers say the suspended prison term issued in March has led to visa issues that have prevented him from rejoining the Pirates. Kang had 21 home runs and 62 RBI in 2016.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: Placed reliever Joe Blanton on the 10-day disabled list with right shoulder inflammation and recalled reliever Matt Grace from Triple-A Syracuse. Blanton is 0-2 with 9.49 ERA in 14 appearances this season, surrendering six home runs in 12 1/3 innings.	Pirates: OF Gregory Polanco was put on the 10-day disabled list with a strained left groin, retroactive to May 15. Pittsburgh called up OF Danny Ortiz from Triple-A Indianapolis. Ortiz made his major league debut as a defensive replacement in the seventh and walked in his first career at-bat.	UP NEXT	Nationals: Tanner Roark (3-1, 3.88 ERA) looks for his first victory since April 26 in the series finale Thursday. Roark has a 5.40 ERA in his last three starts.	Pirates: Tyler Glasnow (1-3, 7.98 ERA) will try to bounce back from a miserable start in Arizona last Friday, when he gave up seven runs in 2 1/3 innings.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

DETROIT --  Hitless in his last 30 at-bats, Tyler Collins finally snapped that long skid and was rewarded for his patience.	Collins hit two home runs, and the Detroit Tigers held off the Baltimore Orioles 5-4 on Wednesday night. After leaving the bases loaded twice in extra innings in a loss Tuesday night, Collins ended his 0-for-30 stretch with a solo homer in the second inning, then added a three-run shot in the fifth.	"I know it's like, statistically an 0 for 30, but I felt great throughout the whole time. I hit a lot of hard balls," Collins said. "That's just baseball, so you can't get beat up by it."	Collins gave Detroit's offense a boost while Miguel Cabrera sat out with a strained oblique. Michael Fulmer (5-1) wasn't at his best, allowing three earned runs and 10 hits in seven innings, but the Tigers gave him enough support.	Justin Wilson allowed two baserunners in the ninth but retired Adam Jones and Manny Machado for his third save in four chances. Machado struck out to end it when first base umpire C.B. Bucknor ruled he swung at the final pitch. Machado, who had tried to check his swing, slammed his helmet down in frustration after the call.	"I just looked at it again. He didn't go," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said afterward. "It was an emotional spot and the crowd wanted it and he gave in."	Ubaldo Jimenez (1-2) allowed five runs in five innings.	The Tigers lost 13-11 in 13 innings Tuesday. Collins had chances to win the game in the 11th and 12th, but was unable to come through with the bases full. He did not have a hit since May 1, but manager Brad Ausmus had seen some positive signs.	"He wasn't having bad at-bats, so that's why I stuck with him," Ausmus said.	Collins connected in the second to tie the game at 1. Ian Kinsler put Detroit ahead with an RBI single later in the inning.	The Orioles scored twice in the fourth -- one of the runs was unearned because of a throwing error by shortstop Jose Iglesias -- and an RBI double by Mark Trumbo in the fifth gave Baltimore a 4-2 lead.	Collins came up in the bottom half with two on and two outs and gave the Tigers the lead again with a drive to right. He also added a double in the eighth.	Baltimore won Tuesday after Trumbo tied it with a ninth-inning homer. The Tigers nearly let Wednesday's game slip away as well.	Jones was 10 for 20 with runners in scoring position this season when he came up in the ninth with men on first and second and one out. Wilson got him to hit a fly to right, and Machado's at-bat ended on the call by Bucknor.	Welington Castillo had three hits for the Orioles for a second straight night.	ROSTER MOVES	The Orioles recalled right-hander Miguel Castro from Double-A Bowie and right-hander Stefan Crichton from Triple-A Norfolk. The team optioned left-hander Donnie Hart to Norfolk and designated catcher Francisco Pena for assignment.	MAKEUP	The Tigers announced they'll play a split doubleheader at home July 1 against Cleveland. The teams had a game postponed May 4.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: All-Star closer Zach Britton (left forearm strain) is expected to throw from 60 feet Thursday, according to Showalter.	Tigers: Cabrera was a late scratch from the lineup. Ausmus said the slugger is likely to miss only two or three days.	UP NEXT	Orioles: RHP Dylan Bundy (5-1) takes the mound in the series finale Thursday. He's had a quality start in all eight of his outings this season.	Tigers: RHP Jordan Zimmermann (3-2) will try to reach 1,000 career strikeouts. He needs nine more.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	---	Follow Noah Trister at www.Twitter.com/noahtrister	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

ATLANTA --  The Atlanta Braves scored six runs before making an out, and things turned ugly in the late innings after a bat flip by Jose Bautista.	All of it was overshadowed by an injury to Freddie Freeman.	The Braves rode a big first inning to their third straight win over the Toronto Blue Jays, holding on for an 8-4 victory Wednesday night after Freeman was struck on the left wrist by a pitch.	Freeman came into the night hitting .343 and tied for the major league lead with 14 homers. X-rays taken at the stadium were inconclusive, and he will get an MRI and other tests to determine the seriousness of the injury Thursday.	His teammates and manager Brian Snitker were clearly concerned about how long Freeman could be out.	"That's the number one thing," said Suzuki, who capped the early onslaught with a three-run homer. "A win is a win. We'll take it. But we're kind of looking at the big picture. When your best player goes down, and he's hit in kind of a freak spot, you're just hoping for the best."	When Freeman was injured in the fifth inning, the umpires initially ruled that Aaron Loup's pitch did not make contact. But with the Atlanta star in obvious pain, the Braves challenged and the call was reversed.	Freeman headed to the clubhouse instead of first base.	"When the best hitter in the game goes out, it really sucks," said Braves starter Mike Foltynewicz (2-4), who allowed three runs in six innings for the win.	There were a couple of altercations in the late innings.	Kevin Pillar struck out swinging to end the seventh and claimed he was quick-pitched by Atlanta's Jason Motte, yelling toward the mound before Suzuki stepped in to calm things.	Then, in the eighth, the benches emptied after Toronto's Bautista homered to left, standing at home plate and staring toward pitcher Eric O'Flaherty before flipping the bat away with a towering toss. Jace Peterson said something to Bautista as he rounded first, and Suzuki was waiting for Bautista when he touched home.	No punches were thrown, but O'Flaherty didn't mince words about Bautista's actions.	"That's something making the game tough to watch," the pitcher said, referring to previous home run celebrations by the Toronto slugger. "It's turned into look-at-me stuff. He hit a home run with (the Braves holding) a five-run lead and throws the bat around. I'm just tired of it. I've seen it from him enough."	O'Flaherty then brought up a huge punch that Bautista took just over a year ago during a scuffle with Texas second baseman Rougned Odor.	"I'm surprised he's ready to fight after last year," O'Flaherty said with a disdainful chuckle.	Toronto manager John Gibbons downplayed Bautista's bat flip.	"Nobody's ever seen that before?" Gibbons said mockingly.	But he conceded that his team was frustrated.	"Those guys have taken it to us the last couple days," Gibbons said.	After the Braves took two straight in Toronto, scoring 19 runs, the teams shifted to SunTrust Park to complete the four-game, home-and-home series.	The result was the same. Atlanta jumped all over Joe Biagini (1-2) the first time up, taking advantage of two walks and a throwing error by the Jays starter.	Nick Markakis had a two-run single and Suzuki followed with a drive into the left-field seats for his second homer of the season, putting the Braves ahead 6-0 before Biagini finally recorded an out.	BASERUNNING ADVENTURES	The Blue Jays also had a tough night on the basepaths.	In the fifth, Toronto squandered a chance for a big inning when Ezequiel Carrera was called for interference for running into Peterson, who was trying to field Justin Smoak's slow grounder toward third base.	The next inning, after Devon Travis was hit by a pitch, Ryan Goins followed with a soft liner that was fortuitously dropped by shortstop Dansby Swanson, who was then able to start a double play.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: SS Troy Tulowitzki (right hamstring) will not come off the DL on Thursday, as Toronto had hoped. "He may need a couple of more days," Gibbons said. ... Also, 3B Josh Donaldson will need a bit longer to recover from a calf injury that's kept him out more than a month. "I might have jumped the gun saying he'd be back for the weekend," Gibbons conceded.	Braves: 3B Adonis Garcia was placed on the 10-day disabled list with tendinitis in his left Achilles tendon. IF Johan Camargo was called up from Triple-A Gwinnett to take his place on the roster, while Peterson took over Garcia's starting spot. Camargo wound up in the game, replacing the injured Freeman and remaining at third base, while Peterson shifted over to first.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays: RH Marcus Stroman (3-2, 3.38 ERA) will go for his third straight win.	Braves: RH Julio Teheran (3-3, 4.08) is coming off a strong performance against the Marlins, allowing just three hits over six scoreless innings.	---	Follow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 .

ST. LOUIS --  Chris Young waited a long time for his opportunity Wednesday night and made the most of it.	Young drove in the tiebreaking run with a pinch-hit single in the 13th inning, and the Boston Red Sox rallied past the St. Louis Cardinals 5-4 to sweep their two-game interleague series.	"In that situation, you get a runner in scoring position and you're just trying to find a way to put the bat on the ball," Young said. "We battled and our bullpen did an amazing job to give us the opportunity to win the ballgame and we're grateful for that."	Jackie Bradley Jr. hit a two-run homer in the seventh off starter Mike Leake to begin Boston's comeback from a four-run deficit. The Red Sox tied it in the eighth against reliever Trevor Rosenthal when Xander Bogaerts hit an RBI triple and scored on Andrew Benintendi's sacrifice fly.	Mitch Moreland doubled with two outs in the 13th and Bradley was intentionally walked before Young singled to left-center off Sam Tuivailala (2-1).	"This win felt big, the way we had to get it," Young said. "It was just one of those we had to persevere and we fought for."	Fernando Abad (1-0) tossed two scoreless innings for the win, and Ben Taylor got three outs for his first major league save.	"This one tonight was a lot of grit, a lot of character, a lot of competitive at-bats late in the game," Red Sox manager John Farrell said. "Jackie with the big two-run homer that kind of got us off nothing because Leake was very good. This was big for us, particularly tonight. This is a big win. It's a huge shift. I think anytime you get this deep into an extra-inning game when you're depleting your bullpen, to come away with a win, they feel like two at times."	Dexter Fowler hit a leadoff homer for the Cardinals, who had won eight of 10. It was his fifth home run this season and the 22nd leadoff shot of his career.	Boston improved to 3-17 when trailing after seven innings, while St. Louis fell to 19-1 when leading after seven.	The Cardinals had 12 hits but did not muster one in the final five innings.	"Not a lot of opportunities," manager Mike Matheny said. "They came in throwing the ball well out of the bullpen and we just couldn't put hits on top of each other."	St. Louis scored three times in the second. Rookie outfielder Magneuris Sierra had an RBI single, extending his hitting streak to seven games. Kolten Wong followed with an RBI double, and Tommy Pham's run-scoring groundout made it 4-0.	Bradley cut it to 4-2 with a drive to center field, his second homer in two games and fourth this year.	Leake allowed two runs and seven hits over seven innings, striking out five without a walk.	Red Sox right-hander Rick Porcello, who lost five of his previous six starts, gave up four runs and nine hits in six innings with six strikeouts and three walks.	1967 CARDS HONORED	The Cardinals celebrated the 50th anniversary of their 1967 championship season with a pregame ceremony. Bob Gibson, Lou Brock, Orlando Cepeda, Steve Carlton, Tim McCarver and Mike Shannon were among the members of that team, which beat Boston in the World Series.	COLD STRETCH	Benintendi went 0 for 5 with an RBI and is hitless in his last 26 at-bats.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: LHP Drew Pomeranz, who left his start Sunday because of tightness in his left triceps, threw a bullpen and is expected to pitch Saturday. ... 3B Pablo Sandoval (knee sprain) is expected to begin a rehab assignment Friday. ... LHP David Price (left elbow strain) will make a rehab start for Triple-A Pawtucket on Friday.	Cardinals: INF Jhonny Peralta (upper respiratory) and RF Stephen Piscotty (right hamstring) could both be activated from the disabled list this weekend. ... LHP Tyler Lyons (right intercostal strain) is expected to make one more rehab start in the minors.	UP NEXT	Red Sox: RHP Hector Velazquez will make his major league debut Thursday night in Oakland to open a four-game series. He has allowed two earned runs over 24 1/3 innings in his last four starts for Triple-A Pawtucket.	Cardinals: After an off day, RHP Michael Wacha (2-1, 3.19 ERA) opens a three-game series Friday against visiting San Francisco. He is 2-0 with a 2.92 ERA in four home starts this season.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Andrew Cashner can finally say he won in his home state of Texas. Jared Hoying took care of a couple of firsts as well.	Cashner pitched seven solid innings and Hoying had his first big league homer in his first four-hit game, helping the Rangers match the longest winning streak in the majors this year at eight games with a 9-3 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Wednesday night.	The right-hander from the Houston area also got his first win with the Rangers, who scored all nine runs in the first five innings after getting just six in the first six starts by Cashner (1-3) when the stocky 30-year-old was in the game.	Hoying was making his second start since coming up from the minors to replace center fielder Carlos Gomez, who is expected to miss at least a month with a right hamstring strain. He finished a triple shy of the cycle and scored three times.	"It's one of those feelings you (can) hardly explain it," Hoying said of his first homer, a two-run shot in the fifth. "It was a real sigh of relief running around the bases."	Delino DeShields matched a career high with four hits, all singles that included two bunts and another infield hit.	Shin-Soo Choo had three hits with three RBI among a season-high 17 hits for the Rangers, who matched the Yankees for the longest winning streak this season and are on their best run since August 2013. The defending AL West champs (21-20) are over .500 for the first time this year.	Zach Eflin (0-1) allowed 11 hits and seven runs in four innings as the Phillies dropped to 3-11 in May. The right-hander hit Joey Gallo with a pitch in the third to become the first Phillies pitcher since at least 1913 to hit a batter in five straight games.	The Rangers turned four double plays in the first five innings behind Cashner, who had gone winless in three previous home starts for Texas and seven appearances as an opponent in Houston over his eight-year career. The Phillies also turned four double plays.	"They're still chirping in the dugout and they're still playing hard, but when things go bad, things snowball," Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said. "When things are going bad, nothing goes right."	Michael Saunders ended Cashner's shutout bid in the seventh with his fourth homer of the season, a two-run shot.	The Rangers scored their first three runs on sacrifice flies and the fourth on a wild pitch before Choo's two-run single made it 6-0 in the third.	LOSING CONTROL	Eflin walked two in the first inning after allowing just one walk in his previous 31 innings, then had the hit batter and the run-scoring wild pitch in the third. "It's more of a focus thing," he said. "I think I could have easily locked it in and got the ball down, but for some reason I couldn't figure it out."	DEBUT AT 32	Austin Bibens-Dirkx made his big league debut at 32 out of the Texas bullpen in the ninth, allowing a run after hitting the first batter he faced, Aaron Altherr. Bibens-Dirkx spent 12 years in the minors and pitched in an independent league last year. He had been on the active roster for 10 days and got his first strikeout. "Well worth the wait I'm sure for him," manager Jeff Banister said. "Well worth the wait for all of our guys."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: LF Howie Kendrick, who has been on the disabled list for a month with a right abdominal strain, is still experiencing soreness. But Mackanin hopes he can take batting practice this weekend in Pittsburgh and possibly return next week after a brief rehab stint.	Rangers: Choo returned after missing two games with back spasms. He was surprised he felt good enough to play, although he said the injury initially didn't feel as severe as back inflammation that prompted one of his four trips to the DL last season.	UP NEXT	Phillies: Rookie RHP Nick Pivetta (0-2, 6.14 ERA) makes his fourth career start in the series finale with the Rangers. The 24-year-old has allowed 23 hits and five walks in 14 2/3 innings.	Rangers: LHP Martin Perez (1-5, 3.89 ERA) has received an AL-low 2.25 runs per nine innings from the Texas offense. He's 0-4 with a 4.88 ERA over his past five outings.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball/	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

CHICAGO --  Long after Kyle Hendricks looked like Kyle Hendricks again and the Chicago Cubs got big hits from Anthony Rizzo and Kyle Schwarber, Cincinnati Reds manager Bryan Price was still upset about the end of the game.	The Cubs wrapped up a 7-5 victory over the Reds on Wednesday night when a replay review overturned a safe call on a close play at first that could have brought the potential tying run to the plate.	"As much as it's hail to the Cubs -- they're the World Series champs and they're great -- we're trying to win the ballgame, too," Price said.	Wade Davis retired the first two batters in the Cincinnati ninth before Joey Votto hit a grounder up the middle that shortstop Addison Russell fielded on the other side of second base. Rizzo had to stretch as far as he could go to bring in Russell's throw, and Votto was ruled safe by first base umpire Ed Hickox.	Cubs manager Joe Maddon challenged the call, and won.	"It's awkward, yeah," Maddon said. "I thought there was one angle that they showed on the board that indicated he was on the bag. Others were not so encouraging."	Price was surprised by the reversal. He said he talked to Reds general manager Dick Williams about calling Major League Baseball about the play.	"That was not a way to end the ballgame unless they can show us something definitively," Price said. "If they can't, shame on them."	Rizzo and Schwarber each drove in two runs as Chicago improved to 22-5 in its last 27 games against Cincinnati. Hendricks (3-2) pitched six effective innings, Davis got his ninth save and Ben Zobrist reached three times with two hits and a walk in his return to the lineup after missing two games with lower back tightness.	Hendricks improved to 2-1 with a 1.82 ERA in his last five starts after going 1-1 with a 6.19 ERA in his first three outings. It's a very encouraging sign for the Cubs after the wiry right-hander blossomed into one of their most dependable starters last year.	"That game was one of my better ones, for sure, too, just because I got stronger in those later innings," he said.	Zack Cozart had three hits and two RBI in Cincinnati's season-high fifth straight loss, but Adam Duvall committed a big error in left field and the Reds missed a couple more plays on defense that led to productive innings for the Cubs. Cozart connected for a solo shot in the third that extended his Wrigley Field homer streak to five games, matching a record for any player at the iconic ballpark.	"Honestly, I don't know what it is. These past two games are the first time since I've been playing with the Reds that the wind was blowing out," Cozart said. "Usually, it's the opposite. So, that makes it a little easier."	Cozart put Cincinnati in front with an RBI single in the first, but Chicago went ahead to stay with five runs in the second against Scott Feldman (2-4).	Votto tried for a backhand stab on Schwarber's hard-hit grounder to first, but it skipped by him for a tiebreaking two-run single. Rizzo's two-run single went off the glove of second baseman Jose Peraza in shallow right field, helping the Cubs open a 5-1 lead.	Chicago added two unearned runs in the third after Duvall misplayed Miguel Montero's fly ball for Cincinnati's NL-low 17th error. Hendricks drove in Zobrist with a well-placed sacrifice bunt, and Jon Jay added an RBI single.	"Defensively, tonight was not our best night," Price said.	BAT'S INCREDIBLE	Part of Kris Bryant's broken bat got stuck in the netting behind home plate after he lined out to Feldman in the first. The teams finished the inning before a worker for the Cubs came out and tried to shake the lumber loose to no avail.	A group of workers finally brought out a long ladder before the start of the third inning and shook it free, earning a big ovation from the crowd of 38,715.	BOOM	Schwarber, who is showing signs of breaking out of his season-long slump, hit a long home run during batting practice that appeared to damage the Budweiser sign that sits on top of the scoreboard in right field. The lights for the first couple of letters were out for the whole game.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: RHP Homer Bailey (right elbow surgery) "has been throwing off a mound aggressively," Price said. He could return late next month. ... LHP Tony Cingrani (oblique) threw 15 pitches in a bullpen session. He is scheduled to throw again on Friday.	Cubs: OF Jason Heyward (sore knuckle on his right hand) will begin a rehab assignment with Class A South Bend on Thursday.	UP NEXT	Cubs ace Jon Lester (1-2, 3.45 ERA) starts the series finale on Thursday afternoon. Left-hander Amir Garrett (3-2, 4.25 ERA) comes up from Louisville to make his seventh start for the Reds.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	---	Jay Cohen can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/jcohenap	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Not even the starting pitcher with the best ERA in the majors could slow down the hot-hitting, free-swinging New York Yankees on Wednesday night.	Aaron Hicks hit a three-run homer to cap a five-run fourth inning, New York piled up 16 hits against Jason Vargas and the Kansas City bullpen, and the Yankees rolled to an 11-7 victory -- their fourth straight game scoring at least seven runs.	"I thought they just put really good at-bats together against him, even the first time through, when we didn't score," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "The second time through, we got to him."	Vargas (5-2) carried a 1.01 ERA into the game, but allowed as many runs in the fourth inning as he had in his first seven starts combined. The veteran left-hander was lifted after allowing six runs on seven hits and two walks in only four innings, ending his home unbeaten streak at 10 games.	"He just wasn't sharp. It's one of those days where he got through the first three OK and then just really struggled to finish off his pitches," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "He was getting pitches up at times. He got hurt on a fastball, a curveball and a changeup -- all three of them."	Then again, maybe Vargas's abysmal night shouldn't have been that much of a surprise. He's never beaten the Yankees in nine starts and 10 outings, going 0-6 with a 7.15 ERA.	"Obviously the home run extended the game for them and put us in a pretty good hole," Vargas said. "I just didn't do a great job of executing."	Michael Pineda (4-2) allowed three runs and six hits with two walks over six-plus innings. The big right-hander was shaky throughout, but good enough to win for only the second time in 16 road starts.	"When you have a lot of scoring like that, you feel pretty good," Pineda said. "Comfortable."	Starlin Castro had three hits and drove in a run. Brett Gardner and Didi Gregorius each had two hits and two RBI. In fact, the only Yankees without a hit by the fifth inning were Matt Holliday and Aaron Judge, and all Judge had done was draw a pair of walks and score both times.	Holliday and Judge promptly got their base hits in the sixth.	Salvador Perez hit a two-run homer and Whit Merrifield also went deep for Kansas City, which scored three times in the ninth to make the final score more respectable.	The Yankees entered the game leading the big leagues with a plus-59 run differential, and they added to it on a windy night at Kauffman Stadium. They pounded their 59th home run through their first 37 games, and scored seven or more runs for the fourth consecutive game.	They routed the Royals 7-1 in the series opener Tuesday night.	TWO FOR ONE	Yankees third baseman Chase Headley was charged with two errors on one play in the seventh inning. First, he bobbled a grounder that allowed Merrifield to reach first safely. Then, he threw widely of first base to allow the lead runner to go from second to third.	A-ROD ON TV	Alex Rodriguez makes his debut as a color commentator for the series finale on Thursday. A-Rod will join Kevin Burkhardt in calling the game on Fox Sports. Rodriguez has been active in TV since his retirement, doing pre- and postgame analysis for Fox Sports along with other projects.	"I get a chance to talk to him tomorrow pregame and talk about the team, so that will be kind of strange," Girardi said. "That means I'm getting old."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals RHP Ian Kennedy played long toss before the game and should be ready to start Saturday. He has been out with a right hamstring injury. "Things are looking pretty good," Yost said. ... CF Lorenzo Cain left after jamming his left wrist trying to make a sliding catch. Yost called it precautionary.	UP NEXT	Yankees LHP Jordan Montgomery goes for his third career win in his seventh big league start on Thursday night. He was battered by Houston in his last start Friday night.	Royals LHP Danny Duffy tries to snap a five-start winless streak against his nemesis. Duffy is just 1-2 with a 7.29 ERA in seven appearances against New York.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  The Los Angeles Angels might want to keep Cameron Maybin right at the top of their lineup.	Maybin had three more hits, Mike Trout homered for the fifth time in six games, and the Angels completed a three-game sweep of the Chicago White Sox with a 12-8 victory Wednesday night.	Maybin, batting leadoff for the second time in an Angels uniform, went 3 for 4 with two runs scored and drew a walk a day after a career-best five hits on Tuesday. He's 8 for 10 in his last two games, breaking out of a slump while finding a comfort zone hitting in front of Trout.	"My answer is going to be that it doesn't matter," Maybin said of where he hits in the Angels' order. "I enjoy leading the way, leading the guys, getting things started. It allows me to use my approach and be a little more patient. Again, it's my job, especially when they put me up there, to get things started and I've been able to do that."	Maybin had one of the best offensive years of his career with the Detroit Tigers last season, but had struggled at the plate with his new team. He broke out in a big way against the White Sox.	"That's just an excuse for people to talk about something," Maybin said. "When you play well, nobody has anything to say. That's your guys' job, to make excuses for us. We've got to come out and perform no matter where you are."	Trout's 13th homer of the season, a three-run shot, keyed a four-run sixth inning for the Angels.	Matt Shoemaker (3-2) gave up two runs in each of the first two innings, but settled down to earn the win. He finished with four runs allowed -- three earned -- and nine hits with nine strikeouts and one walk in 6 1/3 innings.	Miguel Gonzalez (3-4) allowed five runs and six hits in 5 2/3 innings. He walked five and struck out two as the White Sox opened their 10-game West Coast road trip on a sour note.	The final game of the series featured 20 combined runs, 28 hits and three errors.	Jose Abreu hit a two-out, two-run homer in the first inning give the White Sox an early 2-0 lead. Chicago made it 4-0 in the second on Yolmer Sanchez's RBI single and Melky Cabrera's run-scoring fielder's choice.	The Angels answered with a four-run second to tie it as Gonzalez walked four in the inning. Ben Revere tripled to drive in a run and scored on Martin Maldonado's groundout. Trout drew a walk to load the bases, and Albert Pujols singled to right to drive in two and tie the game at 4.	Los Angeles then scored four times in the sixth, capped by Trout's homer, and four more in the seventh to take a 12-4 lead.	The White Sox fell to 17-21 after allowing 24 runs over the last three games. They've lost 14 of their last 15 games at Angel Stadium.	"I do think we're better than that," White Sox manager Rick Renteria said. "We're continuing to compete. At this point, I still think it's a long season. We still have 120-something games left. You have peaks and valleys in every season. I think it's how you respond and continue to chip away and move forward in the course of a season."	PRECAUTIONARY TALE	Pujols was taken out of the game in the seventh inning as a precautionary measure, according to Angels manager Mike Scioscia, after he experienced some tightness in his hamstring. It was a combination of trying to turn a single into a double -- he was thrown out -- in the sixth inning and the cooler weather.	It's unclear how many games Pujols will play as the Angels take a 10-game road trip that includes two National League parks to play the New York Mets and Miami Marlins. Pujols has mostly been in the Angels lineup as the designated hitter, but would have to play first base in those parks. Scioscia didn't speculate on how many games he might play.	SHOT FIRED	White Sox pitcher Tommy Kahnle was the subject of a surprising rant by Minnesota Twins broadcaster LaTroy Hawkins during Tuesday's broadcast of the Rockies-Twins game.	Hawkins and Kahnle played together with the Colorado Rockies in 2014. Hawkins said they had a physical fight in 2014 and called Kahnle "one of the worst teammates I've ever had in my life."	Said Kahnle: "It's weird, but stuff happened in the past. Everybody is entitled to their own opinion. That's really all I've got. I don't take it to heart."	He found out via messages from friends because Kahnle said he doesn't have social media.	"I've got nothing on it. I've put it way in the past. I'm way over it," Kahnle said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox: INF Yoan Moncada, one of baseball's top prospects, is expected to go on the 7-day disabled list Thursday with a sore left thumb. An X-ray and MRI were negative.	Angels: RHP Huston Street (right lat strain) is facing live hitters in Arizona. He could be ready to return in early June. ... RHP Andrew Bailey (right shoulder inflammation) was seen by a doctor, who confirmed there's no new damage. Bailey will be on a maintenance program for two weeks and then he'll be reassessed. ... RHP Mike Morin (neck tightness) is expected to face live hitters in Arizona tomorrow.	UP NEXT	White Sox: RHP Dylan Covey (0-3, 3.83 ERA) has yet to win his first game of the season. This will be his seventh start and fifth on the road, opening the series in Seattle on Thursday. Covey made his major league debut last month. In his last start, he struck out a career-best nine batters and walked two in a no-decision against the Padres.	Angels: RHP Ricky Nolasco (2-2, 4.34 ERA) has given up two home runs in five of his last six starts and has allowed 13 home runs in eight starts this season. He'll face the Mets, who had lost seven straight games, on Friday.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

SEATTLE -- Christian Bergman had the best start of his career right when the Seattle Mariners needed it.	Bergman pitched into the eighth inning Wednesday night, holding the Oakland Athletics to two hits with a career-high nine strikeouts in Seattle's 4-0 win.	It was the first time in his career Bergman (1-1) had reached the eighth inning in a start, and his strikeout total tied James Paxton for the most in a game by a Mariners pitcher this year. He held Oakland without a hit until the fifth and earned his first win since May 5, 2016, when he was a member of the Rockies. It was his first win as a starter since Sept. 21, 2014.	After the game, Bergman said the strikeouts, more than anything, made him realize this was a special night.	"If I strike out five or six in a game it feels like 10. It's not something I normally do," Bergman said. "It felt like a lot tonight. It was a good night."	Bergman's start gave the Mariners' bullpen a much-needed rest. Seattle has already used nine starters this season, tied for the league high, and the bullpen has been taxed recently.	"We talked before the game what we needed to do to give our bullpen a breather," Mariners manager Scott Servais said. "I think it was only the second time our starters got us into the eighth inning. It's been a while."	Bergman, who was making his 17th start in 58 career appearances, joined the Mariners when he was selected from Triple-A Tacoma on May 7. He gave up seven hits and three runs over five innings in his previous start at Toronto on Friday. He quickly showed this time out would be different, retiring the first six batters of the game with three strikeouts. He walked just two, one of them coming in the eighth to the final batter he faced.	"He really stepped up and was in total control from the get-go," Servais said.	Jean Segura extended his hitting streak to 16 games with a two-run single in the fifth inning and Nelson Cruz drove in two runs for the Mariners, who took two of three in the series against Oakland.	Jesse Hahn (1-3) gave up four runs -- three earned -- and five hits in five innings. Oakland has lost five of its last six games.	"Offensively, I don't know that we've looked much worse," Athletics manager Bob Melvin said.	James Pazos relieved Bergman in the eighth and finished the game, retiring all five of his batters.	"That was just awesome to watch," Pazos said of Bergman's performance. "He really just stepped it up today. We needed it for sure, and he got it."	TRAINERS ROOM	Oakland: Yonder Alonso was pulled from the game in the seventh inning with left knee soreness.	HAPPY BIRTHDAY	Mariners OF Ben Gamel turned 25 on Wednesday and got his first career triple in the first inning when his drive skipped past right fielder Matt Joyce to the wall. "I think it was my first one in professional baseball, getting a hit on my birthday," Gamel said. "It's been a couple rough birthdays."	ROSTER MOVES	Before the game, Seattle recalled RHP Casey Lawrence from Triple-A Tacoma and optioned RHP Chase De Jong to Tacoma. Lawrence was claimed off waivers from Toronto last week. He was 0-3 with an 8.78 ERA for the Blue Jays. De Jong is 0-3 with a 7.40 ERA in six games for the Mariners.	UP NEXT	Athletics: RHP Sonny Gray (0-1, 3.78 ERA) will make the 100th start of his career against Boston. Gray is 0-2 with a 5.40 ERA in three career starts against the Red Sox.	Mariners: RHP Sam Gaviglio (0-0, 4.50 ERA) will make his first career start to open Seattle's home series against the White Sox. Gaviglio's only major league appearance was May 11, when he gave up one run and two hits in two innings at Toronto.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

SAN DIEGO --  Look who's leading the NL Central -- the Milwaukee Brewers.	Jett Bandy singled in the go-ahead run with one out in the ninth inning and the Brewers beat the San Diego Padres 3-1 on Wednesday night to take the division lead from St. Louis, which lost to Boston in 13 innings.	"High spirits all around, for sure," Bandy said. "Hopefully we can keep that rolling."	The Brewers have won five of six games.	"We're all young guys, we all have stuff to prove and everyone's going out there competing every day," Bandy said. "It's not how you start, it's how you finish, so if we can keep this going, it's going to be really fun."	The Brewers had only two hits going into the ninth before getting four straight with one out against reliever Brandon Maurer (0-3). Travis Shaw, who missed the previous two games with a swollen right index finger, started the rally with a double to left. Domingo Santana reached on a single that glanced off the glove of leaping shortstop Erick Aybar, and Bandy hit a bouncer up the middle to score Shaw. Keon Broxton singled to load the bases and Santana scored on Orlando Arcia's groundout.	"We put together a good inning at the end," manager Craig Counsell said. "It's a good win. You take it how you can get it."	Starter Matt Garza held San Diego to a run and four hits in six innings, struck out three and walked one. Jacob Barnes (1-0) pitched the eighth for the win and Corey Knebel pitched the ninth for his second save.	"What a game like tonight's means is finding different ways to win," Counsell said. "Tonight was pitching. ... What excites me is that we win games in different ways because that means as we go on through the season, we've got different tools to put together wins."	The Padres wasted a brilliant effort by Jhoulys Chacin, who struck out eight in seven innings, retiring 19 straight batters at one point. Chacin left an inning after the Padres tied it at 1.	The right-hander fell behind 1-0 after four batters. He walked leadoff hitter Eric Sogard, allowed a single to Hernan Perez and then a one-out RBI single by Shaw.	He then settled in and retired 19 straight until walking Bandy with two outs in the seventh. He struck out Broxton to finish his night's work. He walked two.	"He was good again," manager Andy Green said. "He's given us the opportunity to win a lot of games. We haven't necessarily gotten enough runs on the board to support him. Leadoff walk to start the game; after that he ends up giving up a ground ball to let that run score but after that he was really, really good. ... I thought he did a great job."	San Diego tied it at 1 against Garza with two outs in the sixth. Wil Myers beat out an infield single to deep shortstop and scored when Yangervis Solarte's lazy fly ball fell just in front of diving center fielder Broxton.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: 1B Eric Thames missed his third straight game with strep throat. Counsell said Thames is making progress. He hit in the indoor cage and took some batting practice on the field. "He's just got to get his strength back," Counsell said. "He's feeling better; just still a little sick, fatigued. He feels like he lost some strength from being sick for four days."	Padres: RHP Trevor Cahill, who had been scheduled to start Thursday, went on the 10-day disabled list, retroactive to Sunday, with a strained pitching shoulder. Righty reliever Kevin Quackenbush was recalled from Triple-A El Paso.	UP NEXT	Brewers: RHP Zach Davies (4-2, 5.80) is scheduled to start the matinee finale of the four-game series. He is 2-0 with a 1.89 ERA in three career starts against San Diego, including 2-0 with a 1.42 ERA in two starts at Petco Park.	Padres: RHP Jarred Cosart (0-1, 3.24) will start in Cahill's spot. Cosart hasn't won a game since Sept. 17, 2015, pitching for the Marlins at Washington.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.
