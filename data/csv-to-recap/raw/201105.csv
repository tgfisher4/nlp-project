BALTIMORE --  Matt Wieters singled home the winning run with two outs in the 13th inning, part of a stunning comeback that gave the Baltimore Orioles a 7-6 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Tuesday night.	After the Mariners got the go-ahead run in the top of the 13th, the Orioles scored twice in the bottom half against Brandon League, who blew his first save opportunity in 10 chances this season.	J.J. Hardy homered and had four hits for Baltimore in his first game back from the disabled list. The Orioles, who bounced back from a 4-3 deficit in the eighth, snapped a four-game losing streak and improved to 1-17 when trailing after seven innings.	Adam Kennedy homered for the Mariners, who took the lead in the 13th on Mike Wilson's first major league hit.	In the 10th inning, both dugouts cleared after Baltimore's Felix Pie and Seattle first baseman Justin Smoak exchanged heated words. Pie was angered by a hard tag by Smoak, who had to chase down Pie after the runner reversed direction while heading toward first.	With runners on first and second in the 13th, Pie hit a wicked smash to second that bounced over the glove of Jack Wilson and into center, tying the game. One out later, Wieters delivered the game-winner.	Jeremy Accardo (2-0) got the win despite allowing a run in the top half of the 13th.	Called up from Triple-A Tacoma on Monday after the Mariners cut Milton Bradley, Wilson made his big league debut as a pinch hitter in the seventh inning. He was 0 for 3 before coming to the plate in the 13th following a leadoff double by Jack Wilson.	Mike Wilson hit a liner that glanced off the glove of Hardy at shortstop. Jack Wilson, who was running on the pitch, scored easily.	But the lead wouldn't last.	The Orioles trailed in the eighth before scoring two runs off Jamey Wright, who came in with a 1.17 ERA.	Derrek Lee drew a leadoff walk and took second on a single by Vladimir Guerrero. Luke Scott followed with an RBI single, and Adam Jones capped the uprising with a run-scoring single up the middle.	For the second time in three innings, Baltimore couldn't hold the lead.	Michael Saunders led off the ninth with a single off closer Kevin Gregg and took second on a comebacker by Ichiro Suzuki. After Chone Figgins grounded out, Smoak hit a soft liner to left that dropped in front of Pie to make it 5-all.	In extra innings, Seattle missed a chance to take the lead in the 12th when Miguel Olivo was thrown out trying to score on a two-out double by Jack Cust.	The Orioles trailed 2-1 before Jones hit a two-run double in the sixth, providing the Orioles with their first lead in 40 innings. But Seattle promptly went back on top in the seventh against Mike Gonzalez.	Saunders launched the rally with a two-out single that ended an 0-for-26 skid. Suzuki beat out a bunt, and Figgins followed with an RBI double. After an intentional walk loaded the bases, Koji Uehara yielded an infield hit to Olivo.	Kennedy hit a two-run homer in the second inning off Jake Arrieta, Seattle's second home run in 10 games.	Hardy made it 2-1 in the third with his first homer as an Oriole. He was activated from the 15-day disabled list before the game after missing a month with a strained left oblique.	It was only the third homer allowed by rookie starter Michael Pineda in seven starts this season.	Game notes	 To make room for Hardy, the Orioles designated RHP Josh Rupe for assignment. ... Baltimore's Brian Roberts went 0 for 5 and has just one hit in his last 31 at-bats.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

NEW YORK --  Derek Jeter is tired of talking about slumps. So is Alex Rodriguez.	They're finally doing something about it.	Jeter had two more hits and drove in another run, A-Rod added a two-run single and Freddy Garcia turned over a two-run cushion to the New York Yankees' bullpen, which held off the Kansas City Royals for a 3-1 victory Tuesday night.	After getting off to a slow start, Jeter found his swing in Texas last weekend -- he had four hits and a pair of homers Sunday. And he brought it with him back to the Bronx, where his average has climbed from .256 on Saturday to .283 after the opener against Kansas City.	"When things are going well, the results are there," Jeter said simply.	The same must be true for Rodriguez.	He'd been in a 9-for-55 slump of his own, and was 5-for-27 with runners in scoring position before his single with the bases loaded gave New York a 3-1 lead in the fifth inning.	"The last few days have been pretty good," Rodriguez said. "[Hitting coach] Kevin [Long] and I have spent a lot of time together, on the field, in the cage."	It paid off in support of Garcia (2-2), who allowed a pair of walks in six-plus innings to win for only the second time in nine decisions against the Royals.	Garcia turned the ball over to David Robertson, who pitched out of a bases-loaded jam in the seventh inning. Joba Chamberlain set down the Royals in order in the eighth, pitching in place of setup man Rafael Soriano, whose right elbow has been bothering him.	Mariano Rivera finished up for his 13th save of the season and 25th straight against the Royals, making a nice stab to start a game-ending double play.	"Mo is one of the few pitchers that can make that play," Jeter said.	Former Yankees outfielder Melky Cabrera provided the Royals with their only run, a solo homer to center field in the fourth inning that briefly tied the game.	It wasn't enough for Kyle Davies (1-5), who allowed all three runs in five-plus innings.	The Royals had plenty of opportunities to help out their starting pitcher, putting runners on base in just about every inning. They simply wasted them all.	Their first series of mistakes came in the third inning, when Matt Treanor led off with a single. He left first base early trying to steal second and Garcia spun around to easily pick him off. Plate umpire Ed Hickox at first called the pitcher for a balk, but he was overruled by his fellow umpires and even Royals manager Ned Yost agreed that it was the correct call.	It proved costly when Chris Getz singled moments later.	Getz made the second baserunning blunder of the inning when he tried to advance to second on a ball in the dirt. Catcher Russell Martin threw him out by about 3 feet.	"These guys are all seeing the benefits of being aggressive, but sometimes it bites you," said Yost, whose team came into the game with 42 stolen bases.	Kansas City missed another opportunity in the fifth, putting two runners on with one out. Light-hitting Alcides Escobar struck out and Nick Swisher made a diving stab of a sinking liner off Getz's bat in right field to end the inning.	"It was a nice play by him," Getz said. "What are you going to do?"	The Royals also loaded the bases with one out in the seventh, but Robertson struck out Escobar and Getz to escape the inning, and Kansas City went quietly the rest of the way.	Game notes	 Yankees RHP Phil Hughes plans to start throwing on flat ground Thursday. He had a cortisone shot about two weeks ago to relieve discomfort in his ailing right shoulder. Hughes has been on the disabled list since April 14. ... The Royals are putting LHP Bruce Chen (strained left side) on the DL and will recall RHP Vin Mazzaro from Triple-A Omaha to start Wednesday night.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PITTSBURGH --  Aaron Miles saw a lot of green to his left and decided a slumping team needed a little jolt of electricity.	The Los Angeles Dodgers second baseman provided it with a perfectly executed bunt, a small play that led to a much-needed big one as the Dodgers broke out of a lengthy hitting slump in a 10-3 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Tuesday night.	"I took a chance," Miles said. "It was a tight game and I gave it a shot. If you give me a chance like that, I'm going to take it every time."	Miles' bunt with two outs and a man on in the sixth extended the inning. Andre Ethier followed with a run-scoring single then Matt Kemp drilled the first pitch he saw from Pittsburgh ace Kevin Correia (5-3) into the center field seats for a three-run homer that took some of the sting out of a bitter loss on Monday night.	The Dodgers unraveled in that one following a controversial call in the eighth that ended with Kemp getting doubled off first when umpires ruled Juan Uribe's sinking liner was caught by Pittsburgh left fielder Jose Tabata.	Uribe and manager Don Mattingly were ejected arguing the call and the Pirates went on to win 4-1.	This time, late in a tight game, the Dodgers didn't leave it up to chance.	Kemp's drive ignited a slumping offense as Los Angeles posted a season-high 15 hits.	"We kept grinding," Mattingly said. "After last night, when things went wrong for us, to turn it around on the next night, it was really big for us."	Ted Lilly (3-3) had little trouble over six innings and Los Angeles won for just the second time in seven games.	The left-hander has received a paltry 2.99 runs of support since the start of the 2010 season, the lowest in the majors. He made sure not to waste a rare offensive outburst by one of baseball's lowest-scoring teams.	"We were pretty tough to stop tonight, and it's really fun out there when our bats are going like that," Lilly said. "The dugout is more fun, and everyone feels a little better about ourselves."	Lilly limited Pittsburgh to two runs on four hits, striking out four.	Andrew McCutchen hit two home runs for the Pirates, who were hoping to give themselves some breathing room after making a rare move above .500 on Monday. Instead, they dropped to 18-18 when Correia ran into trouble in the sixth.	Correia cruised through the first five innings and appeared to be on his way to another clean frame after easily retiring the first two batters in the sixth.	Then the pinpoint control that has fueled his solid start to the season briefly disappeared.	Carroll singled to center and Miles dropped a bunt down the third-base line. Pittsburgh's Brandon Wood let the ball roll, hoping it would go foul.	It didn't, though Mattingly gave all the credit to Miles.	"He was on his own," Mattingly said with a laugh.	Ethier lined a single up the middle just out of the reach of second baseman Neil Walker to put the Dodgers up 1-0. A pitch later, the lead ballooned to 4-0 as Kemp drilled a Correia fastball over the wall in center for his seventh home run of the season.	"[Miles] put a perfect bunt down, kept the inning alive and the three-hole hitter comes up and fists the ball and the cleanup hitter hits a three-run homer," Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said. "It looks good when you draw it up that way."	McCutchen responded in the bottom half with a solo shot to left and Walker added a sacrifice fly to cut the lead to 4-2. But the Dodgers added some insurance an inning later thanks to a little charity by the Pirates.	Rod Barajas doubled with one out, then Jerry Sands smacked the ball back at Correia. The ball caromed off Correia toward first, where Steve Pearce gloved it and tried to flip it between his legs to Correia covering. Correia never saw it and even if he did, he'd have been powerless to grab it as it sailed 20 feet left of the bag.	Barajas scored and Correia hobbled to the dugout, his night over.	Correia's steady presence at the top of the rotation has been a pleasant surprise for the Pirates. But while he's been lights out on the road, things haven't been so good at PNC Park. He's failed to pick up a win in all three of his home starts. Not that the bullpen was any better. The Dodgers added five more runs in the eighth to send the most of the modest crowd home early.	Kemp, Ethier and Barajas had two hits each for Los Angeles, whose 10 runs were the most since putting up 12 in a win over the Chicago Cubs on April 22.	"We'll take a game like this whenever we can get it," Carroll said. "It was good to have a few big innings, it's something we haven't had around here in awhile."	Mattingly has preached patience during his team's slow start. He has called a couple of team meetings -- the last in New York over the weekend -- reminding his players to not get too worked up over their recent slide. For a night, at least, the Dodgers looked relaxed. Then again, they almost always do against the Pirates.	Los Angeles has dominated Pittsburgh over the last decade, winning 70 percent of the meetings between the two teams and taking every season series between the clubs since 2001.	Game notes	 Lilly became the 17th active pitcher with at least 1,500 career strikeouts when he got Matt Diaz to whiff in the first inning. ... Pittsburgh's solid play hasn't exactly led to an uptick at the gates. A crowd of 13,497 watched on Tuesday. ... Los Angeles reliever Blake Hawksworth left with a groin injury after coming in place of Lilly in the seventh. Mattingly said it's too early to tell how long Hawksworth may be out.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

TORONTO --  Jon Lester felt bad about letting down Boston's batters.	David Cooper hit his first major league homer and drove in the winning run with a sacrifice fly in the 10th inning as the Toronto Blue Jays beat the Red Sox 7-6 on Tuesday night.	Adrian Gonzalez homered twice for Boston, the 11th multihomer game of his career, and David Ortiz added a solo shot.	Even with that support, Lester wasn't able to keep the Blue Jays in check.	"I basically ruined a good night for the offense," he said.	Jose Bautista hit his 11th home run of the season and rookie J.P. Arencibia also went deep as Toronto improved to 4-1 in extra innings.	Lester, who failed to extend his winning streak to five starts, allowed five runs and seven hits in 5 1/3 innings. He matched a career high with five walks and struck out five.	"It was uncharacteristic," Red Sox manager Terry Francona said. "He wasn't pumping strikes, he wasn't throwing it where he wanted to. It looked like he was a little bit frustrated."	Lester acknowledged losing his cool, and said it hurt him on the mound.	"I have to do a better job of controlling my emotions and not worrying about [calls] and worrying about the next pitch. I didn't do a very good job of that," he said.	Rajai Davis hit a one-out single off Matt Albers (0-1) in the 10th and stole second on the first pitch, a pitchout, sliding in just ahead of the tag on a low throw from catcher Jason Varitek.	"If we get the ball in the air on the one to second, we got him," Francona said.	Davis stole third on the very next pitch, and the Red Sox brought their infield in. Cooper won it with a fly to center.	"Once I saw [Davis] get those two bags I was like, just get something to the outfield and let's win this game," Cooper said.	Albers and Varitek shared the blame for allowing the speedy Davis to reach third base.	"I shouldn't have let him steal third," Albers said. "I think that one was on me. I've got to keep him closer and keep him at second."	Varitek said the throw to third was a tough one.	"[Davis] had a pretty good jump, and we had a breaking ball called," he said.	Carlos Villanueva (1-0) pitched a scoreless inning for the win.	The Red Sox, who had their three-game winning streak snapped, were trying to reach the .500 mark for the first time this season.	"Whatever our record is, we always want to win these games," Francona said. "We want to win every game. That's how we always feel. I don't care what our record is."	Cooper entered in the sixth as a replacement for Blue Jays shortstop Yunel Escobar, who left after he was hit just above the left ankle by a pitch from Lester. Escobar is day-to-day.	Toronto took a 6-5 lead when Cooper connected off Daniel Bard to begin the eighth, but Gonzalez answered by opening the ninth with a solo drive to left off Frank Francisco, who had his first blown save.	"We're seeing what everybody has talked about," Francona said of Gonzalez. "When he leverages the ball to left field, he looks like a right-handed hitter."	The Blue Jays had lost three straight and seven of nine coming in, but jumped on Lester with three in the first, taking advantage as the lefty walked three of his first four batters. Lester's third base on balls, to Edwin Encarnacion, came with the bases loaded. Aaron Hill and Juan Rivera followed with RBI grounders.	"We started out in a hole and that's a hard way to play," Francona said.	Boston got one back on Carl Crawford's RBI single in the second and cut it to one on a leadoff homer by Ortiz in the fourth, his fifth.	Gonzalez gave the Red Sox a 4-3 lead with a two-run shot to left in the fifth, his fifth, but Bautista tied it with a leadoff shot in the bottom half.	Arencibia restored Toronto's lead when he opened the sixth with a drive to left, his fifth.	The Red Sox tied it in the eighth against Toronto lefty Marc Rzepczynski. Jed Lowrie doubled and was replaced by pinch-runner Jose Iglesias, who went to third on Crawford's grounder. Jarrod Saltalamacchia tied it with a two-out single.	Toronto rookie Kyle Drabek allowed four runs and eight hits in five innings. He walked three and struck out five.	Game notes	Jacoby Ellsbury's first-inning single extended his hitting streak to 19 games, while Crawford's RBI single in the second extended his hitting streak to 10 games. ... Blue Jays 1B Adam Lind (sore back) missed his second straight start. Manager John Farrell said Lind is feeling better, and has not yet had an MRI or X-rays.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ATLANTA --  Jason Marquis picked up a milestone victory against a familiar team.	Laynce Nix and Jayson Werth hit three-run homers for Washington to send Marquis to his 100th career win, though the Nationals had to hold on at the end for the 7-6 triumph after Atlanta nearly wiped out a big lead Tuesday night.	Trailing 7-1, the Braves scored five times in the eighth off Marquis and two relievers. Pinch-hitter Brooks Conrad hit one to the wall in the ninth that was hauled in just a few feet short of a tying homer.	Marquis (4-1) gave up seven hits and three runs in 7 1/3 innings to improve his career mark to 100-93. The 32-year-old beat his original team, picking up his first 14 wins with the Braves from 2000-03.	"It was exciting, obviously, that I got 100 here," he said. "It's definitely a special part of my career. Who would have ever thought when I first broke in that I'd get to this point? But I guess a lot of hard work and good fortune with health has allowed me to do that."	Dan Uggla capped Atlanta's big eighth with a three-run homer, but Drew Storen got the final three outs -- barely -- for his eighth save in eight chances.	"The way we came back makes me feel good about this ballclub," Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez said.	Atlanta's Tim Hudson lasted only five innings, his shortest stint of the season, after tossing a one-hit shutout against Milwaukee in his previous start.	Hudson had allowed only one homer all season before the Nationals took him deep twice. But the Braves starter certainly didn't get much help from his defense, which committed two errors and had two other miscues that were generously ruled hits. Four of the seven runs off Hudson were unearned.	"Huddy pitched well," said Nate McLouth, who made perhaps the most crucial error when he dropped a flyball in the fourth. "He didn't deserve that. That ball I dropped, there's no excuses."	Nix took advantage of McLouth's error with a homer that pushed the Nationals to a 4-0 lead. Werth, off to a slow start after signing a $126 million contract over the winter, appeared to put it out of reach with another three-run shot in the fifth.	But the Braves almost pulled it out. Eric Hinske and Chipper Jones had run-scoring hits in the eighth before Uggla drove one out in left-center off Tyler Clippard.	"It was a little scary there," Washington manager Jim Riggleman said.	Early on, the Braves played some frightening defense.	Roger Bernadina led off the game with soft roller to first that was scooped up by Freddie Freeman. The normally sure-handed fielder started trotting toward the bag -- and inexplicably dropped the ball before he got there for an error. After Bernadina stole second, Ian Desmond hit a grounder up the middle that was bobbled by shortstop Diory Hernandez, filling in for ailing Alex Gonzalez. It was ruled a hit but just as easily could've been Atlanta's second error of the inning.	Werth grounded into a double play to bring home Washington's first run.	Hudson cruised into the fourth, still having allowed only the one questionable hit, and retired the first two batters. Then, more defensive problems.	Adam LaRoche hit a tricky grounder toward first that ricocheted off Freeman attempting a backhanded scoop. Originally called an error, it was changed to a hit. But Freeman's disgusted reaction made it clear he should've made the grab. Wilson Ramos followed with a flyball to right-center that gave Atlanta a second chance at the third out.	McLouth called for the ball running over from center, then took a peak at Jason Heyward running over from right. Perhaps he was mindful of a collision the two had last year that left the much-smaller McLouth with a concussion. Whatever the case, the ball caromed off McLouth's glove for an error, extending the inning.	This time, the Nationals really made Atlanta pay. Nix drove a low fastball deep into the right-field seats for his fourth homer of the season.	"I took my eye off the ball to see where Heyward was," McLouth conceded. "I just took it for granted that I was going to catch it."	The Braves picked up their first hit off Marquis in the bottom half, Martin Prado leading off with his fourth homer to make it 4-1. Werth canceled that out -- and then some -- with his drive over the left-field wall in the fifth, another big two-out hit for the Nationals.	"A month ago, I would have swung and missed," Werth said. "Two weeks ago, I probably would have hit it foul. A week ago, I would have hit it to the third baseman."	This time, he hit it out.	Game notes	 Gonzalez sat out after tweaking his left hamstring Sunday. He said the injury is "nothing to worry about" and he could be back as soon as Wednesday. ... Nix started for the Nationals because Mike Morse has a tender knee. Riggleman said he went with Nix mainly because he could cover more ground defensively, but he came up huge on offense. ... Braves RHP Derek Lowe threw his normal side session with no problems. He came out of his last start with a large blister, but plans to make his next scheduled start Thursday in the series finale against the Nationals. ... Freeman did make a nifty catch over his shoulder, but it was generally a miserable night for the rookie. In the seventh, he was thrown out inexplicably trying to stretch a single into a double with his team down by six runs.
