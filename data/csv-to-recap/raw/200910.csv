ST. LOUIS -- Unemployed in August and a star for the Los Angeles Dodgers in October. Once Vicente Padilla got out of the first inning, he slammed the door on the St. Louis Cardinals' season.	The second-chance pitcher kept Albert Pujols and Matt Holliday quiet in a 5-1 victory Saturday night that gave Los Angeles a second straight trip to the National League Championship Series.	"Anytime you win a series it's good," Casey Blake said. "But to sweep the Cardinals, it just doesn't happen. I would have never guessed we would have swept them."	The Dodgers got their sweep in a series that will be remembered most for Holliday's pivotal dropped fly ball with two outs in the ninth inning of Game 2.	Andre Ethier missed the cycle by a single, Manny Ramirez had three hits and two RBIs and the Dodgers didn't need another St. Louis fielding blunder to sweep their division series opponent for a second straight season. Los Angeles scored all five runs with two outs.	Closer Jonathan Broxton struck out Rick Ankiel for the last out and pumped his fist as the Dodgers ran out to the mound to celebrate becoming the first team to advance to the championship series. They await the winner of the Philadelphia-Colorado series that is even at a game apiece. The Phillies beat Los Angeles in the NLSC last season in five games.	Pujols and Holliday were a combined 2 for 8 with a late RBI for the Cardinals, who never recharged after becoming the first National League team to clinch a division title. Counting the postseason St. Louis was 1-9 after wrapping up the NL Central, and was swept for the first time in the division series or NLCS play and only for the third time overall in the postseason.	This team and the 1928 team that got swept in the World Series by the Yankees are the only teams in franchise history to fail to win a game in the postseason.	"It's hard to believe we're thinking about next year," Ryan Ludwick said. "It just seems a long way away."	Pujols, 3 for 10 with an RBI and no extra-base hits in the series, left Busch Stadium without speaking to reporters. Holliday was 2 for 12 with a solo homer.	"For some reason, our offense, we couldn't get anything going," Holliday said. "We had some good at-bats here or there but as far as stringing anything together we had a hard time."	Padilla, designated for assignment by the Rangers in early August, was 4-0 the final month with the Dodgers before shutting down the Cardinals on four hits over seven innings in his first career postseason appearance. After escaping a bases-loaded jam in the first inning he was dominant, retiring 19 of 21 hitters against a team he last faced in 2003.	"Big lineup," Padilla said through an interpreter. "I just tried to make the pitches that I knew I was capable of throwing."	The Dodgers were already up 3-0 in the third inning when starter Joel Pineiro dropped Pujols' simple toss at first for an error on James Loney's grounder for the lifeless Cardinals, who were beset by bad play this series.	Holliday got a standing ovation from a sellout crowd of 47,296 before his first at-bat with two men on and one out in the first. Then he tapped out to the mound. Pfft.	Over and over, he said he was touched by the ovation. Even if it was a recruiting pitch for a player headed for free agency.	"Whatever it was, I'm appreciative of it," Holliday said. "Obviously that was a hard pill for me to swallow, that ball. To get that kind of acknowledgment, I'm very appreciative."	Ramirez, only 1 for 8 the first two games amid suggestions by manager Joe Torre that he was trying too hard, gave the Dodgers the early lead with a two-out RBI double in the first.	"I was just trying to be more aggressive," Ramirez said. "Anything on the plate, I was ready for."	Ethier, who had only one homer in the last 12 games of the regular season, jumped on a 3-1 pitch for a two-run shot that made it 3-0 in the third. It was his second homer of the series.	"To show up now and contribute and be a main guy, it's nice to come through," Ethier said.	Ronnie Belliard singled to start the fourth, stole second and scored on Rafael Furcal's single for a 4-0 cushion.	That was more than enough for the Dodgers, who were 2-5 against the Cardinals during the regular season with all the games between mid-July and mid-August when St. Louis was its best.	Joel Pineiro, a 15-game winner and the last of the Cardinals' big three starters to come up empty, allowed four runs in four innings in an outing that matched his shortest of the season. The sinkerball specialist allowed only 11 homers in the regular season, but surrendered five in his last three starts.	The Cardinals' demise, though, was due to the failure of an offense beefed up with the acquisitions of Holliday, Mark DeRosa and Julio Lugo since late June. St. Louis was 4 for 30 (.133) with runners in scoring position against an underrated Dodgers pitching staff, totaling six runs and stranding 28 runners.	One of them, Yadier Molina, doubled with one out in the seventh and than ran into an easy out on a groundball in front of him.	Furcal, the Dodgers' leadoff man, had two hits and was 7 for 12 in the series with two RBIs. Ethier was 6 for 12 with three RBIs after getting no RBIs in his first 37 career postseason at-bats.	John Smoltz struck out five in two innings. The Cardinals finally broke through on Pujols' run-scoring single off Broxton in the eighth.	The Cardinals totaled three or fewer runs in 18 of their last 33 games. They fell to 6-2 in division series in 14 seasons under manager Tony La Russa.	"I've ended playoffs 14 times this way," Smoltz said. "It's never easy. You always think you're going to win the next game."	Game notes	Matt Morris, who pitched for five Cardinals postseason teams, threw out the ceremonial first pitch with Chris Carpenter on the receiving end. ... Attendance of 47,296 was the largest at 4-year-old Busch Stadium. ... Cardinals 3B DeRosa played for the Cubs last year and has been on the wrong end of Dodgers first-round sweeps the last two years.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

BOSTON -- Torii Hunter emerged from the visitors' clubhouse at Fenway Park to spray champagne over the fans and family gathered there. Erick Aybar did him one better, handing over bottles of bubbly to those who came from California to see the Los Angeles Angels go for the sweep.	History gave no reason to hope for such a celebration.	The Angels and Vladimir Guerrero shrugged off their postseason failures and swept away the Red Sox on Sunday, scoring three runs off Jonathan Papelbon in the ninth inning to beat Boston 7-6 and advance to the AL Championship Series.	It was the first postseason sweep in Angels franchise history. And they did it against the team that has knocked them out of the playoffs the previous four times they met.	"I told you guys earlier: It's going to be a different scene," Hunter said in the clubhouse afterward. "Vladdy came through. That's probably one of the biggest hits of his career. They've been waiting for him to do it, and he did it."	Papelbon was one strike away from extending the series with three different batters, but Aybar singled on a two-strike pitch, Chone Figgins walked after fouling off a full-count offering and Bobby Abreu fouled off three straight pitches before doubling in one run.	Hunter was walked intentionally before Guerrero singled the first pitch to center and Figgins and Abreu raced home to give Los Angeles a 7-6 lead. Major league saves leader Brian Fuentes pitched the ninth, and when Aybar caught Dustin Pedroia's popup to end the game, pumping his right arm even as he tracked the ball with his left, the Angels advanced.	"It's nice to be going home and playing again, instead of going home and it's over," said pitcher John Lackey, who was part of the Angels teams that were eliminated by Boston in three times in the previous five years. "This is the most fun for me, and I've got a ring. That says a lot."	An eight-time All-Star and former AL MVP, Guerrero has a .321 career batting average, 407 regular-season homers and 1,318 RBIs. But he'd managed only one extra-base hit in 69 at-bats going into Game 3, and he had one RBI in 19 playoff games since his grand slam against Boston in the 2004 division series.	And he came through against Papelbon, who had never before allowed a run in 27 postseason innings.	"You're not going to get to him too often. But we did this afternoon," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "And I felt great for Vlad. hopefully, that's a momentum-builder for him. ... I know he's relieved. He's excited about contributing. And hopefully it will be the start of something good."	For the AL West champion Angels, it was a chance to extend their tribute to pitcher Nick Adenhart, who was killed in an April car crash with a man who has been charged with drunken driving. As they streamed out of the dugout to celebrate, and Jered Weaver carried Adenhart's jersey onto the field.	"When it comes down to honoring Nick Adenhart, and what happened in April in Anaheim, yes, it probably was the biggest hit [of my career]," Guerrero said. "Because I'm dedicating that to a former teammate, a guy that passed away."	The Angels open their first ALCS since 2005 on Friday against the New York Yankees, who beat the Twins 4-1 on Sunday night to complete a three-game sweep.	"We're finally here," said Angels owner Arte Moreno, who bought the team in 2003, a year after they won their only World Series. "I think that the fourth time's a charm. It's great for us, because we've been knocking on the door for a while."	Los Angeles trailed 5-1 early, was behind 5-2 after seven innings and still down 6-4 when Papelbon retired the first two batters of the ninth.	The crowd that just one inning earlier had been primed for a celebration quietly filed out of the ballpark for the last time in 2009, having seen the wild-card Red Sox beaten.	"The season doesn't wind down. It just comes to a crashing halt," Boston manager Terry Francona said. "You go into the top of the inning excited because you think you're going to keep playing. Half an inning later, you're going home. So it's disappointing."	The Red Sox had won 12 of 13 postseason games against the Angels heading into the series, including an 11-game winning streak that dated back to Dave Henderson's homer off Donnie Moore in the 1986 ALCS. Henderson, not coincidentally, threw out the ceremonial first pitch on Sunday, even adding a little jump and twist like the one he did after he helped propel Boston to within one strike of the '86 World Series title.	Hendu's shot in Game 5 sent the Red Sox to a win by the same 7-6 score.	Boston didn't win it that year, but they ended their 86-year championship drought in 2004 after sweeping Los Angeles in the first round. The Red Sox swept out the Angels again in '07 en route to a second title, and beat them in four games last year before losing to the Tampa Bay in the ALCS.	Darren Oliver earned the victory after getting one out in relief, and Papelbon took his first career postseason loss. The Red Sox closer had converted seven of his previous eight postseason save opportunities.	But after Billy Wagner put two on with two out in the eighth, the Red Sox were forced to bring Papelbon in with a 5-2 lead. He gave up a two-run single to Juan Rivera that made 5-4 before picking pinch-runner Reggie Willits off first base.	After Mike Lowell's RBI single made it 6-4 in the eighth, Papelbon got Maicer Izturis on a foul popup and Gary Matthews Jr. on a fly ball to center. Abreu lined a double off the Green Monster to cut the lead to 6-5.	The three runs Boston scored in the third inning were more than it had scored in the first two games of the series combined. In fact, Boston had scored a total of two runs in 32 postseason innings before taking a 3-0 lead on Sunday.	Game notes	 The Red Sox hadn't been eliminated in Boston since the Chicago White Sox finished off a three-game sweep in the 2005 first round. ... Mike Napoli was hit by a pitch in the second inning, but Red Sox catcher Victor Martinez argued that it hit the end of his bat. Napoli was also hit in Game 2 by Josh Beckett, who argued that the batter didn't make any effort to get out of the way.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

MINNEAPOLIS -- Alex Rodriguez finally delivered the playoff performance he needed and his talent demanded, powering the New York Yankees back to the AL Championship Series.	During this first-round sweep of the Twins, Rodriguez's performance was nothing like all those oh-fers of Octobers past.	Rodriguez and Jorge Posada hit seventh-	inning home runs to spoil Carl Pavano's opportunity to frustrate New Yorkers one more time, and the Yankees advanced to their first ALCS in five years with a 4-1 victory over Minnesota on Sunday night.	Rodriguez got off to a rocky start this year when he admitted in spring training to using steroids when he was with the Texas Rangers. Then he had hip surgery and missed the first month of the season as the Yankees stumbled out of the gate.	But baseball's highest-paid player returned with a more positive outlook, and New York surged to the top of the AL East.	Still, the third baseman entered this postseason in an 0-for-27 slide with runners on base dating to Game 4 of the 2004 ALCS.	"I knew that I couldn't change all the 0-for-4s, 0-for-5s and all the guys I left on base," said Rodriguez, who went 5 for 11 with two homers and six RBIs in these three games. "I'm content right now, both on and off the field."	Mariano Rivera got the last four outs in the final baseball game at the Metrodome, preserving Andy Pettitte's record-tying 15th career postseason win.	The Yankees will host the Los Angeles Angels in Game 1 of the ALCS on Friday night after missing the playoffs altogether in 2008.	"It's exciting," Rodriguez said. "We were very disappointed last year when we went home, and ownership got us some good players. We came out and played like a team, like a group of brothers."	Teammate Derek Jeter offered plenty of praise.	"The most impressive thing? He hit home runs when we needed him to," Jeter said. "He's been doing it all year really. He's been seeing the ball well the whole year."	This pitching duel between former teammates Pettitte and Pavano ended with another first-round playoff victory in Minnesota for the Yankees, who also eliminated the Twins here in 2003 and 2004.	"I was trying to match zeros with him," Pettitte said.	For all their success this decade by being so good at the basics, the Twins made glaring gaffes at the worst times. Doing that against the team that led the majors with 103 wins doomed them.	"It seems like just yesterday that we were pouring champagne for winning the division, and now it's over," catcher Joe Mauer said. "It just burns that we're done. I'm still trying to figure that one out."	The Yankees aren't about to let an opponent get away with overrunning the bases, as Carlos Gomez did in Game 2 to cost the Twins a run. Nick Punto then wasted his leadoff double in the eighth by failing to see that Denard Span's single didn't get past shortstop Jeter, and he was thrown out trying to retreat to third base.	Posada, who was upset when he was benched for Jose Molina with A.J. Burnett on the mound on Friday, gave Rivera more room with an RBI single in a two-run ninth as the crowd began to file out of the Dome for the final time.	Pettitte, who retired 17 of the first 18 batters he faced, left Joba Chamberlain a 2-1 lead with one out in the seventh. He matched John Smoltz for postseason victories, getting his first such win for the Yankees since the 2003 World Series against Pavano's Florida Marlins, who won it all that year.	The Yankees haven't experienced that euphoria since 2000, with the Pettitte-Posada battery, closer Rivera and captain Jeter the only pieces left from that squad.	"Up and down, there's no room to breathe," Twins first baseman Michael Cuddyer said. "That's why they spent all that money in the offseason, for this time of year."	Rivera came in to get Mauer on a bat-shattering groundout to end the eighth after the Twins blew their chance to score against Phil Hughes because of Punto's blunder. Manager Ron Gardenhire put his hands to his head in exasperation, and Orlando Cabrera followed with a flyout to center that could've got the run in.	"They deserve all the accolades. They've got the whole deal, and they've got some of the classiest guys out on the field," Gardenhire said. "I hate it when we play against them, because they kill us."	The Twins left 26 runners on base over the first two games, including 17 in the 11-inning defeat in Game 2, failing to get those big hits.	Pavano couldn't have started any stronger against the team that couldn't wait to get rid of him after four forgettable seasons. He struck out four during the first trip through baseball's best lineup -- the Yankees led the majors in runs, homers and on-base percentage during the regular season -- and the only hit he gave up in the first four innings didn't make it out of the infield.	Effectively spotting his changeup and sinker, Pavano completed seven innings with a season-high nine strikeouts and no walks.	"He was tough," Posada said. "You've got to give a lot of credit to him."	The last professional baseball game under this billowing roof was supposed to be a week ago. After beating Detroit in an AL Central tiebreaker on Tuesday night, here the Twins were, playing in front of another packed stadium.	They made every game down the stretch count for more than just a last-chance-to-see-the-Metrodome memory, catching Detroit with 17 wins in their last 21 games including that epic tiebreaker game for the division title on Tuesday.	Ah, but these Yankees aren't the same as the Tigers or the White Sox or the Royals, as the Twins were painfully reminded during the first two games in New York -- and again on Sunday.	Mauer's two-out single in the sixth justified the "MVP!" chants, gave the Twins their first lead at home over the Yankees in four games this year.	Pettitte, who became the major league leader in career postseason innings pitched, snapped back to strike out Cuddyer on a high fastball. The 37-year-old left-hander pumped his fist as he headed to the dugout.	Then Pavano's performance was quickly blemished by the big opposite-field homers by Rodriguez and Posada. Rodriguez had fallen behind 0-and-2 before working the count full. Just like that, the Yankees were back in front.	Game notes	 Pavano's nine strikeouts marked a Twins record for a postseason game. ... Twins bullpen coach Rick Stelmaszek, who has been on the staff since 1981, threw out the honorary first pitch. ... The Yankees are 51-1 this season when limiting their opponent to two runs or less. ... The Yankees went 5-5 against the Angels this season.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

DENVER -- Between frosty breaths on the mound, Brad Lidge warmed to the challenge and erased a season of frustration.	Philadelphia's beleaguered closer stranded runners at first and second on a bitterly cold Sunday night when he retired Troy Tulowitzki on a flyball for the final out, preserving the Phillies' 6-5 win over the Colorado Rockies in Game 3 of their NL playoff series.	"When the postseason starts, it's a completely clean slate," said Lidge, who is from Denver. "It's definitely a treat to be able to play here right now, get a chance to pitch in front of family and friends."	Huston Street allowed Ryan Howard's sacrifice fly in the top of the ninth that scored Jimmy Rollins with the tiebreaking run after another blown call by the umpires.	In a game that started with temperatures near freezing and ended past midnight, the defending World Series champs took a 2-1 lead in the best-of-five series. They can wrap it up Monday when they send Game 1 winner Cliff Lee against Rockies ace Ubaldo Jimenez.	The save was surely sweet redemption for Lidge. He converted all 48 save chances last year, capped when he struck out Tampa Bay's Eric Hinske in Game 5 to clinch the Phillies' World Series title.	But he lost his perfect touch this season -- he led the majors with 11 blown saves, went 0-8 with a 7.21 ERA and briefly lost his job in September.	"He's had ups and downs," Howard said. "Right now he's here to finish games. That's what matters. I was glad to see him out there."	After Rollins led off the ninth with a single and moved up on Shane Victorino's sacrifice bunt, Chase Utley hit an infield single to put runners at the corners.	The ball hit Utley's right leg while he was still in the batter's box and should have been ruled a foul ball, but home plate umpire Jerry Meals didn't call the ball dead.	"It looked like it hit him," Helton said. "That was my first reaction that the ball hit him. Then I thought he was out [at first]."	First-base umpire Ron Kulpa ruled, however, that Helton was pulled off the bag by Street's throw over the runner.	Meals told The Associated Press after the game that he missed the call. He said replays showed the ball indeed hit Utley.	"Yeah, the ball came up and grazed off his leg and continued rolling up the line," Meals said. "No. 1, it wasn't seen by myself or anybody. If you look at it, you'll be able to see it. Off the front leg, got him up in the knee-thigh area. It just grazed him and the ball continued to roll the way it was rolling. I just saw a ball hit and rolling out there and that's it.	"Chase Utley took off like it was nothing," Meals added. "He gave no indication to us that it hit him. Whatever percent of the time, you're going to get a guy that's going to stop if it hits him.	Utley said, "The ball might have caught me."	"Nobody said anything, so I ran hard," he said. "I check swung. The ball checked up in front of me. It might have hit my leg. But nobody made a call."	Umpires have had a rocky first week of the playoffs, including an admitted missed call in the eighth inning of Game 2 of the Yankees and Twins series.	Lidge came out of the bullpen for the ninth and retired pinch-hitter Brad Hawpe before walking Carlos Gonzalez, who swiped second. Pinch-hitter Jason Giambi fouled out before Todd Helton walked, bringing up Tulowitzki.	The Rockies' cleanup hitter has excelled in these situations this season, but not tonight. He got under the pitch and flied out meekly to left to end it. Tulowitzki slammed his bat to the ground with both hands when he lifted the routine fly, then flung down his helmet once it was caught.	"I felt like I got a good swing," Tulowitzki said. "I got under it a little bit, hit it high. It's a situation you want to be in."	Rockies manager Jim Tracy suggested that with speedsters on the base paths -- Eric Young Jr., perhaps the fastest player in the majors, was pinch running for Helton at first -- all Tulowitzki needed was a hit toward the gap to send the Rockies home winners.	The temperature when Rockies right-hander Jason Hammel threw his first pitch at 8:08 p.m. was a crisp 35 degrees, tying the record low set when Cleveland hosted Florida in Game 4 of the 1997 World Series. Phillies manager Charlie Manuel was the Indians' hitting coach.	It was so chilly the players' breaths swirled around them like smoke as the mercury dipped into the 20s.	At least there was none of the icy mist, bitter wind, freezing rain and snow that blanketed the downtown Denver ballpark a day earlier, when the gametime temperature would have been 26 degrees.	"That might have been difficult for the Broncos to play in that yesterday, much less a baseball game," Tracy said.	Players and coaches looked like they were dressed for a day on the slopes, not a night at the ballpark, donning ski caps and extra gear to stay warm and dry, and they huddled by heaters and on warmed benches in the dugouts and bullpens.	"Once the game started, I didn't get cold at all," Manuel said. "I figured the guys on the field didn't if I didn't. I'm standing in the dugout. Of course, there was a heater there. But I was standing behind the heater. That's how smart I am."	With the game pushed back a day, Manuel ditched plans to give 37-year-old right-hander Pedro Martinez his first postseason start in five years and went with rookie left-hander J.A. Happ instead. That neutralized the Rockies' most potent lineup, sending third baseman Ian Stewart and Seth Smith to the bench.	Tracy juggled his lineup, benching Hawpe, his All-Star right fielder who has slumped over the second half of the season, and replacing him with Ryan Spilborghs. He also moved catcher Yorvit Torrealba up two spots to fifth in the order. Torrealba went 0 for 4.	Carlos Ruiz broke a 4-all tie in the sixth with his second run-scoring single, this one off Jose Contreras, who walked the two batters ahead of him. Tulowitzki's sacrifice fly in the seventh tied it at 5.	Winning pitcher Chad Durbin threw a 1-2-3 eighth.	Game notes	 Yorvit Torrealba Jr., 12, who was kidnapped in Venezuela this summer along with a couple of older relatives before being released unharmed, threw out the ceremonial first pitch to his father, who embraced his boy afterward. ... Utley homered in the first.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

DENVER -- Chase Utley ducked near second base. The rest of the Philadelphia Phillies never flinched.	Ryan Howard hit a two-run double with two outs in the ninth inning and scored on Jayson Werth's single as Philadelphia rallied past the Colorado Rockies 5-4 in Game 4 on Monday to reach the NL Championship Series.	Brad Lidge, bouncing back from a ragged regular season, earned his second consecutive save by again retiring cleanup batter Troy Tulowitzki with runners on first and second for the final out.	Tulowitzki, who flied out to end Game 3, struck out this time and the Phillies celebrated on the infield at chilly Coors Field before retreating to the clubhouse to spray champagne .	"I can't see and it hurts," Howard said. "But it hurts good."	Next, the World Series champions play Thursday night against Los Angeles at Dodger Stadium in an NLCS rematch from last season. This marked the fourth straight year that none of baseball's first-round series went to a winner-take-all Game 5.	"These couple of games have been kind of character builders," Howard said. "This is just step two of where we're trying to get to."	After Dexter Fowler's hurdle of Utley sparked Colorado's three-run rally in the eighth, Howard and the Phillies responded with a three-run rally of their own against closer Huston Street.	Street was 35 of 37 on save chances this season, but took the loss in Game 3 when he allowed Howard's tiebreaking sacrifice fly in the ninth.	"We had gotten to Huston Street the night before, so we knew we had a shot to make some things happen," Howard said.	Colorado had lost just once all season when leading after eight innings, and Street started the ninth with a strikeout of pinch-hitter Greg Dobbs.	Jimmy Rollins singled with one out and Utley drew a two-out walk on a full count. Howard tied it with two strikes when he doubled to the right-field wall. Werth followed with a soft single to right-center.	"We were a strike away from making a trip to Philadelphia," lamented Rockies manager Jim Tracy, who went 74-42 after taking over when Clint Hurdle was fired May 29.	The Phillies, the NL's best road team, swept both games at Coors Field, where the wild-card Rockies went 44-17 under Tracy's tutelage.	"We stood toe to toe with the defending world champions," Street said. "I take full responsibility for there not being a Game 5 and not keeping us alive."	The Rockies looked as if they were going to send the series back to Philadelphia when Yorvit Torrealba's two-run double broke a 2-all tie in the eighth. That came after Fowler scored the tying run on pinch-hitter Jason Giambi's two-out single.	Fowler hurdled Utley, who stepped into the basepath to field Todd Helton's slow grounder, and his quick flip to second base was wide right and mishandled for an error by Rollins.	"That was a football play," Rollins said. "That was like jumping over a defender trying to get to the end zone, and he made it."	Fowler, one of several promising rookies on the Rockies, said it was an instinctive move.	"I saw Utley coming, I saw the ball and I thought, 'Don't get tagged out.' I think I was going too fast for me to stop, so I just kept it going," Fowler said.	That put two on for Tulowitzki, and Ryan Madson relieved starter Cliff Lee in a double-switch that also brought in left fielder Ben Francisco to replace Raul Ibanez.	It paid an immediate dividend when Francisco raced in and made a diving catch of Tulowitzki's bloop to left for the second out. But Francisco couldn't get to Giambi's single fast enough to keep Fowler from scoring the tying run from second base.	Then, Torrealba sent a two-run double to right-center for a 4-2 Rockies lead.	"No one got rattled and no one was worried," Werth said. "Going back to '07, we got swept by the Rockies and I think everybody learned a lesson. Everybody knew what we had to do."	With a crowd just shy of 50,000 going crazy, the Phillies bounced right back.	"Losing a game like this is tough," Helton said. "We showed a lot of heart out there today, the whole season for that matter. Tough way to go out."	The Phillies led the National League in homers for the second straight season with a franchise-record 224 but they had only gone deep twice in this series before Shane Victorino sent a 99 mph fastball from Ubaldo Jimenez into the Rockies' bullpen in the first. Werth sent an 85 mph changeup into the Phillies' bullpen next door in the sixth for a 2-0 lead.	Those were the only runs Jimenez allowed in seven strong innings that included seven strikeouts and six hits. He left trailing 2-1 after throwing 126 pitches, one shy of his career high.	Lee, who pitched a six-hitter to win the series opener, allowed three runs -- one earned -- and five hits in 7 1/3 innings. He repeatedly worked out of jams until the eighth.	The Rockies had hoped to rely on the resilience that helped them overcome an 18-28 start under Hurdle to finish with a franchise-best record of 92-70. They sent right-hander Aaron Cook ahead to Philadelphia on Monday morning to rest up for a Game 5, but he'll fly home instead.	The Rockies made it 2-1 in the sixth on an RBI double by Tulowitzki, but he was doubled up on Garrett Atkins' low liner to third baseman Pedro Feliz.	At 45-29, the Rockies posted the best second-half record in the National League, but they missed out on a chance to win the NL West and secure home-field advantage when they lost at Los Angeles on the next-to-last day of the season. Jorge De La Rosa, whose 16 wins after June 1 were tops in baseball, strained his groin in that game and was shelved for the series against Philadelphia.	"I'm sure they're going to be back here in years to come because they're good and they're young," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said.	His team is good and seasoned -- and moving on.	Game notes	 The Phillies are 50-33 on the road and 6-2 in their last eight road playoff games. ... Philadelphia won last year's NLCS in five games. ... Torrealba has 15 career postseason hits, one more than Kaz Matsui for most in Rockies history. ... Carlos Gonzalez's 10 hits tied a Rockies division series record set by Dante Bichette. ... It was 48 degrees after Game 3 was played in the mid-20s.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

LOS ANGELES --  Brad Lidge has regained that nasty slider. Ryan Howard and Carlos Ruiz are stroking big hits. Cole Hamels is winning postseason games without his best stuff.	Boy, this is looking real familiar for the Philadelphia Phillies.	Ruiz and Raul Ibanez hit three-run homers, reliever Ryan Madson got a key out and Lidge finished off the Phillies' 8-6 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 1 of the NL championship series Thursday night.	"We do have the talent and just that sort of fight, that we're going to do everything we can to get those big hits in those big moments," Hamels said. "Our offense is really what's setting the tone."	Philadelphia took a 2-0 lead in last year's best-of-seven NLCS, beat the Dodgers in five games and went on to win the World Series.	"Well, they had our number today," Dodgers catcher Russell Martin said. "Tomorrow is a different day, and last year is over with."	Manny Ramirez homered, but grounded out weakly with two runners on against a struggling Madson to end the Dodgers' two-run rally in the eighth. Their 14 hits set a club record in a single LCS game, but they stranded 10 runners.	"It's like a prize fight, we just came up a little short," Dodgers manager Joe Torre said.	Lidge worked around a single and a walk in the ninth, helped by a double play that made him for 3 for 3 in save chances this postseason -- he posted three saves against the Dodgers in last year's NLCS.	Lidge was perfect in save tries all last year, but led the majors with 11 blown opportunities this season.	"The Dodgers are a great team. They come from behind a lot so you take everyone seriously," he said. "Honestly, for some reason I've really been locked in this postseason. I felt really good mechanically. I feel like myself. I feel pretty comfortable right now."	Home runs dominated on both sides in a game that lasted 4 hours, 2 minutes. Ruiz highlighted a five-run burst in the fifth and Ibanez homered in the eighth for an 8-4 lead as the Dodgers failed to neutralize the Phillies' left-handed hitting.	"The Dodgers aren't going to back down. We know they're going to come in waves and continue to fight, and that's what they did," Howard said. "We just needed that one big hit to kind of get us over the hump, and Carlos came through. We got guys on, and guys came through when we needed big hits."	James Loney also connected for the Dodgers. Ramirez, baseball's all-time postseason home run leader with 29, hit a two-run shot.	Los Angeles will start Vicente Padilla against Philadelphia's Pedro Martinez on Friday afternoon in Game 2.	Hamels thrived under pressure last October, earning NLCS and World Series MVP honors. But the left-hander hardly resembled the same pitcher in earning the victory, giving up a postseason career-high eight hits and two homers. He allowed four runs in 5 1/3 innings.	It was his first outing since he left the ballpark in the division series against Colorado to be with his wife as she prepared to give birth.	"It doesn't look good on paper, but there were a lot of times where the counts were in my favor and I kept them off-balance," Hamels said. "Unfortunately, some of the results weren't there, but in the key situations, I was able to get what I needed."	At 21 years and 211 days, Clayton Kershaw was the youngest pitcher ever to start a Game 1 in a league championship series, and it showed.	The Dodgers lefty was tagged for five runs in the fifth, when he set a LCS record for most wild pitches in an inning with three. He also tied the record for most wild pitches in a LCS game, shared by Tommy John and Juan Guzman.	"The first four innings I felt great, and then I couldn't make adjustments fast enough. In the playoffs, you're not going to have a lot of leverage. If you don't make your pitches, before long you're out of there," he said.	"I just got out of the strike zone a little bit, and that's what happens. They make you pay for that."	Kershaw allowed four hits in 4 2/3 innings and walked five in his second postseason career start. He worked out of the bullpen in last year's NLCS, which the Dodgers lost 4-1 to the Phillies. He was 0-2 with a 5.23 ERA in two starts against them during the regular season.	"It looked like he tried to overthrow the ball, got frustrated out there. Unfortunately, it got away from him quickly," Torre said. "As far as the pressure of the game, he certainly can handle it, but sometimes things get away from you."	The Dodgers' usually solid bullpen couldn't contain the Phils. George Sherrill, their fourth reliever of the game, gave up Ibanez's homer on the first pitch, the first homer off him by a left-handed hitter this year. Howard and Jayson Werth drew consecutive walks to open the eighth.	"I was trying not to do too much, stroke a line drive," Ibanez said. "Fortunately, I got it in the air and it carried out of the park."	The Dodgers got two runs back in the bottom half on Martin's RBI single and a sacrifice fly by Rafael Furcal. They had the tying runs at first and third with two outs, but Madson won a showdown when Ramirez grounded to third.	Kershaw retired five of the previous six batters he faced before the Phillies got to him. Ibanez led off with a single and took second on a wild pitch before Kershaw walked Pedro Feliz. Ruiz sent a 2-1 pitch into the "Mannywood" section in left field for a 3-1 lead.	Jimmy Rollins reached on a fielder's choice, then advanced two bases on consecutive wild pitches. Chase Utley walked and Howard hit a two-run double, extending the Phillies' lead to 5-1. Howard passed Hall of Famer Mike Schmidt with his 17th postseason RBI, most in Phillies' history.	The Dodgers closed to 5-4 with three runs in the bottom half. Ramirez hit his first home run since Sept. 18, a drive into the left-field pavilion off Hamels. Martin, who led off with a double, scored on Andre Ethier's grounder.	Ramirez's RBIs gave him 78 in the postseason, putting him three away from breaking baseball's career record of 80 by Bernie Williams.	Los Angeles threatened in the sixth, loading the bases on consecutive singles by Loney and Ronnie Belliard off Hamels and a two-out walk to pinch-hitter Jim Thome by J.A. Happ. But Happ retired Furcal on a grounder to end the inning.	Loney got his first RBI of this postseason when he drove Hamels' 2-1 pitch just over the right-field fence leading off the second, giving the Dodgers a 1-0 lead.

LOS ANGELES --  A grounder off a fielder's glove. A bunt that slipped by two players. The Los Angeles Dodgers' latest postseason rally began in the weirdest, wackiest way.	Another throwing error by Chase Utley, a pinch-hit single and two walks also were part of the Dodgers' crazy eighth inning that produced a 2-1 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Friday, tying the NL championship series at one game each.	The Dodgers took the lead after the Phillies pulled Pedro Martinez, who allowed just two hits over seven shutout innings. Andre Ethier drew a bases-loaded, two-out walk from rookie J.A. Happ, capping the Dodgers' third comeback win of this postseason.	"We've been doing it all year, it seems like. We're relentless. We never give up," catcher Russell Martin said. "We go out there and compete, play through 27 outs, and whatever happens, happens. But we never keep our heads down."	Game 3 in the best-of-seven series is Sunday in Philadelphia.	"We only need three more games to do something special," said Dodgers slugger Manny Ramirez, who went 0 for 4 with a strikeout.	Vicente Padilla pitched brilliantly for 7 1/3 innings and the Los Angeles bullpen did the rest. Hong-Chih Kuo threw three pitches, getting two outs and the win. Jonathan Broxton worked a perfect ninth for the save.	Philadelphia wound up using five relievers in the eighth, but not Brad Lidge, who didn't get into the game.	"I don't think it will have any lasting effect on us," Martinez said. "We didn't execute. We made errors. If we hit like we normally do, I don't think the game's going to end up 2-1."	For the second time in this year's playoffs, a visiting team let a late lead slip away at Dodger Stadium. Last week, St. Louis left fielder Matt Holliday's two-out error on an easy fly ball in the ninth doomed the Cardinals, who got swept by the Dodgers.	They perfected their late-inning magic during the regular season by winning 12 games in walk-offs, third best in the majors.	Martinez and Padilla dueled through seven innings in a matchup of castoffs.	Padilla allowed one run and four hits, struck out six and walked one. He exited to a standing ovation from the sellout crowd of 56,000, tipping his cap as he walked off.	"It's my first time playing in front of a big crowd like this in a game that's more important than I've ever pitched in my life, and I was very emotional," Padilla said through a translator.	An injury-plagued Martinez was let go by the Mets last season, while Padilla got dumped by Texas in August. He signed with the Dodgers two days later, excelled in their drive to a second consecutive NL West title and pitched well against St. Louis in the first round.	"I was very happy with the way I pitched," Padilla said. "Although we were losing, I knew that the guys were going to come back, and I think I'm more happy now because the team won."	Ethier led the Dodgers with a career-high 31 homers in the regular season, but he resisted his instincts with the bases loaded and a full count.	"Of course, you want to get the job done by swinging, but at the same time, don't be too aggressive and don't get yourself out," he said. "Donnie [hitting coach Mattingly] has been preaching to me a lot that once the playoffs start, be patient, get your pitch to hit and see it. Donnie's voice was in my head the whole time, and I guess it came in handy there."	The Dodgers were down 1-0 when Casey Blake opened the eighth with a single off the outstretched glove of third baseman Pedro Feliz. Ronnie Belliard's bunt single got past Chan Ho Park and first baseman Ryan Howard.	"The bunt was a huge play, the fact that it got by Chan Ho and it got over in no-man's-land where Howard couldn't get to it," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said. "It seemed like we couldn't get out of the inning."	Martin followed with a grounder to Feliz, who made a good throw to Utley. But once again, the four-time All-Star threw away the relay after making just four throwing errors in the regular season. This time, it allowed pinch-runner Juan Pierre to score the tying run from the second.	"I had plenty of time to turn it. I just didn't make the throw," Utley said. "A lot of things could have gone differently, not just that play. Chan Ho made a good pitch to get a ground ball, which was what we needed, but we couldn't turn it."	After Thome singled off Scott Eyre, Rafael Furcal drew a walk from Ryan Madson that loaded the bases. Happ struck out Matt Kemp, but walked Ethier.	"He laid off it looked like some tough pitches away, and at 3-and-2 it's tough when your mentality is swing, swing, swing to take a pitch, and it was huge," Dodgers manager Joe Torre said.	Former Dodgers pitcher Park took the loss, giving up two runs and two hits in one-third of an inning.	Howard's homer in the fourth off Padilla accounted for the only run until the eighth.	The game began in 93-degree heat 16 hours after the Phillies won the series opener 8-6. The teams combined for 14 runs on 22 hits and 10 walks in that game, but offense was in short supply with Martinez and Padilla pitching.	Martinez struck out three and walked none in seven innings of his first postseason appearance since Game 3 of the 2004 World Series with Boston. The three-time Cy Young winner, who turns 38 later this month, proved ageless in the stadium where he made his major league debut with the Dodgers in September 1992.	Replacing guile with gas, Martinez only gave up singles to Martin and Kemp before turning it over to Park.	Ramirez twice got retired by good friend Martinez on weak popups.	Game notes	 The Dodgers improved to 7-2 all-time in NLCS Game 2s; the Phillies dropped to 1-7. ... Martinez became the first Latin American-born pitcher to start a postseason game for the Phillies. ... Kobe Bryant caused a stir upon arriving in the middle of the fourth inning to join owner Frank McCourt and former Dodgers manager Tom Lasorda in their seats behind home plate.

NEW YORK --  CC Sabathia heated up as the night went on, throwing fastballs past the Los Angeles Angels and pumping his fist for emphasis.	On a blustery night more suited to bobsleds than baseballs, Sabathia pitched eight superb innings of four-hit ball to win his second straight postseason start, and the New York Yankees took advantage of a rare sloppy game by the Angels to win the AL championship series opener 4-1 Friday.	"That's why we got CC," Johnny Damon said. "To be a workhorse during the season, of course, but to shut down teams in the postseason."	The Angels looked like chilled Californians withering in the unseasonable wintry weather, making three errors that led to two unearned runs and allowing an infield popup to drop untouched for an RBI single. Even Torii Hunter, an eight-time Gold Glove center fielder, allowed a single to roll past him.	"It was just CC. CC was the cold weather," Hunter said. "CC's the real deal, man."	Because of the cold conditions, the traditional foul line introductions were scrapped. It was 45 degrees at gametime, and a 17 mph wind made it feel worse.	"The wind was playing havoc on a few balls out there," Damon said.	Back in the ALCS for the first time in five years, New York built a 2-0 lead in the first. Derek Jeter and Damon singled, and left fielder Juan Rivera threw to the shortstop position for an error that put runners on second and third.	Alex Rodriguez's one-out sacrifice fly -- his seventh RBI of the postseason -- gave the Yankees the lead, and Hideki Matsui followed with a short popup. Third baseman Chone Figgins and shortstop Erick Aybar each thought the other would snag it, and the ball fell for a single as Damon came home.	"These guys are not going to be robots out there," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "It's a mistake. It was ugly. But it happens."	Angels starter John Lackey crouched and screamed in anger. Scioscia spoke with Figgins in the dugout between innings.	"The fans didn't have anything to do with that," Aybar said. "None of us called for it."	The night didn't get much better for Los Angeles.	After Kendry Morales' fourth-inning single cut the deficit in half, Matsui hit an opposite-field double to left-center in the fifth that made it 3-1. Lackey's throwing error on a pickoff attempt allowed Melky Cabrera to take second in the sixth, and Jeter followed with a run-scoring single that got by Hunter.	"Sometimes there isn't any communication, but it's the first game," the Angels' Vladimir Guerrero said.	Sabathia, 2-0 with a 1.13 ERA in his first postseason with the Yankees, gave up a double and three singles, struck out seven and walked one, going to three-balls count just twice.	"It was about as cold as it gets," he said. "It was pretty nasty today."	The crowd repeatedly chanted the initials of the big lefty, who may start three times if the best-of-seven series goes the full length. Sabathia showed his heightened emotion, especially when he pumped a fist after striking out pinch-hitter Mike Napoli to end the seventh.	"That was a great feeling to have the stadium rocking and to be chanting my name and to be able to get a strikeout," he said. "I don't really show a lot of emotion a lot of times, but it came out of me there."	Mariano Rivera pitched a hitless ninth for his record 36th postseason save, his second this year.	"It wasn't fun under these conditions," Jeter said.	New York won the opener against the Angels in the 2002 and 2005 division series only to lose Game 2 both times and get beaten in the series. A.J. Burnett is slated to start Game 2 for the Yankees, at 4-0 the only unbeaten team in this postseason. Joe Saunders, who hasn't pitched since Oct. 4, goes for the Angels. Rain is in the forecast for Saturday, and a postponement is possible.	"It's disappointing but we know we got seven games in this series and it's the first team to four, not one," Hunter said.	While players took batting practice in ski caps, sweat shirts and gloves, the giant video board in center showed the NLCS game in Los Angeles, where the temperature was in the 90s and fans wore short sleeves.	Nick Swisher, Damon and Mark Teixeira wore special caps with ear flaps -- Yankees equipment manager Rob Cucuzza had stocked them all season but hadn't used them before. Second baseman Robinson Cano wore a ski mask.	"I was wearing the Elmer Fudd for the first time in my career, but I had a few guys with me," Teixeira said. "As far as Robby is concerned, we'll get on him."	Aybar appeared to be wearing a sweat shirt with a red hood. In the stands, actress Kate Hudson was bundled in a purple hood.	After pitching 7 1/3 shutout innings in the opener of a first-round sweep of Boston, Lackey gave up four runs -- two earned -- and nine hits in 5 2/3 innings. He didn't get much support from the Angels, who didn't attempt any steals.	"I didn't even have sleeves on," Lackey said. "It wasn't that bad out there once you got going."	New York won a World Series title in its first season at the original Yankee Stadium in 1923 and went on to play exactly 100 Series games there. The Yankees hope to reach the Series in the first season at their new $1.5 billion ballpark.	After the opener, New York was feeling fortunate.	"We don't see them do that too often," Damon said. "So we'll take it."	Game notes	 It was only the second of 84 games at new Yankee Stadium with no homers. The other was a rain-delayed June 18 game against Washington. ... Rodriguez ran through a stop signal by third base coach Rob Thomson and was thrown out easily in the fifth by Aybar, who took the throw from Rivera. A-Rod bowled into catcher Jeff Mathis, who held onto the ball. ... There was another disputed call, with first base umpire Laz Diaz ruling Hunter out on his sixth-inning bunt. Scioscia argued that Teixeira's foot came off the first-base bag when he stretched for Sabathia's throw -- replays were inconclusive.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

NEW YORK --  Alex Rodriguez is putting all those playoff failures behind him. The Los Angeles Angels are turning the AL championship series into a defensive debacle.	Coming through under pressure once again, Rodriguez hit a tying homer in the 11th inning and the New York Yankees edged Los Angeles 4-3 Saturday night on Maicer Izturis' error in the 13th for a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.	"Wow, what a game," Rodriguez said.	After the rain came and went on another chilly night, New York pulled out its latest late-inning thriller and remained unbeaten in this year's playoffs. The game ended at 1:07 a.m. when Izturis threw away Melky Cabrera's grounder to second base.	"Izzy just tried to do too much," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "You're not going to turn two."	Pinch-hitter Jerry Hairston Jr. opened the 13th with a single off losing pitcher Ervin Santana in his first postseason at-bat. Brett Gardner sacrificed and Robinson Cano was intentionally walked as the crowd chanted "Melky! Melky!"	Cabrera hit a bouncer in the hole between first and second, and Izturis made an ill-advised attempt to throw back across his body for a force at second. The low toss skipped past shortstop Erick Aybar and rolled behind third, where Chone Figgins tried to pick it up.	Figgins fumbled the ball and Hairston, who had slowed up, sped home and slid in with the winning run.	"It hit my glove and kind of kicked off," Figgins said." It's one of those crazy things that I was backing up but the ball slipped out of my hands."	It marked another sloppy performance by the Angels, and finished a game that lasted 5 hours, 10 minutes.	"I was a little aggressive there," Izturis said. "I'm not scared to be aggressive. Unfortunately, it cost us the game."	The Yankees poured out of the dugout to celebrate, knocking over Hairston behind the plate.	Moments later, he took a whipped cream pie in the face from starter A.J. Burnett, which has become a fan-favorite tradition for the Yankees after walk-off wins this year.	They led the majors with 15 such victories and have added two in the playoffs -- the Yankees are 5-0, including a first-round sweep of Minnesota in which Rodriguez went 5 for 11 with two home runs and six RBIs.	"I'm doing what I've done all year -- try to stay in the moment and really enjoy the moment," he said. "I had a blast out there today."	Rodriguez saved New York in this victory, hitting a leadoff shot against major league saves leader Brian Fuentes to keep the game going. He had a chance to win it in the 12th, but flied out with the bases loaded to end the inning.	"As soon as he tied it, we knew we were going to win this game," Hairston said. "We don't give up. We really don't."	Derek Jeter also homered and Cano had an RBI triple for the Yankees. Mariano Rivera threw 2 1/3 shutout innings, his longest outing since May 30, 2006.	After a travel day, the best-of-seven series shifts to Anaheim, Calif., for Game 3 on Monday. Jered Weaver is scheduled to pitch for the Angels against Andy Pettitte, with a forecast of 73 degrees and partly cloudy skies.	The warm weather will allow players to ditch the ski masks and hoods some have sported under their baseball caps in New York. It was 47 degrees at gametime, 2 degrees warmer than Friday night, with 15 mph winds gusting to 23 mph.	"Right now we are all in sleep mode. Hit that plane, get some sleep," Yankees outfielder Nick Swisher said. "We've just got to go out there and get two more. One thing about going out to Anaheim is we don't have to bring our long sleeves."	Most fans were still around for the finish, though many were huddled in bright ponchos under the overhangs. It was the longest postseason game by innings since Houston beat Atlanta 7-6 in 18 innings on Oct. 9, 2005.	The Angels, normally sound on fundamentals, have been betrayed by their defense in this series. They made three errors during a 4-1 loss in the opener and let an infield popup drop for an embarrassing RBI single.	With rain falling as the clock ticked past midnight, Figgins gave Los Angeles a short-lived 3-2 lead with an RBI single in the 11th off Alfredo Aceves -- his first hit in 19 at-bats this postseason.	Fuentes came on to try and close it out, but Rodriguez led off and lined an 0-2 pitch into the front-row of right-field seats, sending the crowd of 49,922 into a frenzy.	"I certainly wasn't sure," Rodriguez said. "I was fortunate to get enough of it."	Said Fuentes: "I was trying to elevate. I just didn't get it up enough."	It was the third homer this postseason for Rodriguez. He hit a tying shot in the ninth inning of Game 2 in the first round against the Twins, and another tying drive late in Game 3.	The three-time MVP has at least one hit and one RBI in every playoff game this year.	Rodriguez entered these playoffs hitless in his previous 18 postseason at-bats with runners in scoring position. Overall, he was 8 for 59 (.136) in the postseason dating to 2004.	Now, he's two wins from his first trip to the World Series.	David Robertson, the eighth New York pitcher, earned his second win of the playoffs. He struck out Gary Matthews Jr. with two on to end the 12th, then retired Vladimir Guerrero with runners at second and third to complete the 13th.	The Yankees, who have won 35 of their last 43 home games, have taken advantage of mistakes by the Twins and Angels throughout this postseason.	"This game was exciting from start to finish," Hairston said. "The energy in the stadium was unbelievable. I just wanted to make sure I was ready in case my name was called."	The Angels stranded 16 and went 3 for 15 with runners in scoring position.	"Deflating," outfielder Torii Hunter said. "That's very uncharacteristic of this team. This is not our baseball. We're not playing up to our capabilities right now. Runners in scoring position, myself and Vladdy, we probably need to do a little better. Offensively and defensively, man, we need to come through a little more."	Needing a solid outing on the mound, the Angels got one from 16-game winner Joe Saunders in his second career postseason start. Pitching for the first time in 13 days, the left-hander fell behind 2-0 in the third, then stymied the Yankees the rest of the way.	Burnett also was effective, allowing two runs and three hits in 6 1/3 innings.	Game notes	 Jeter's third-inning homer was his second of these playoffs and No. 19 of his postseason career, breaking a tie with Yankees Hall of Famers Mickey Mantle and Reggie Jackson for third place behind ex-teammate Bernie Williams (22) and Manny Ramirez (29). ...

PHILADELPHIA --  Cliff Lee sprinted off the mound after throwing his final pitch, nearly breaking a sweat for the first time. Heck, he almost outhustled the Phillies' newest speed demon, Ryan Howard.	With their ace and slugger leading the way, the defending World Series champions got back their swagger.	Lee dominated the Dodgers, Howard and Jayson Werth provided the big swings early and Philadelphia cruised past Los Angeles 11-0 Sunday night for a 2-1 lead in the NL Championship Series.	"We expect to win when we come to the ballpark, and that's kind of who they are," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said.	Lee provided another brilliant playoff start, striking out 10 and allowing only three hits in eight innings.	"Cliff Lee, what can I say about him? He was absolutely outstanding," Manuel said.	Howard ran hard for a triple, Werth homered and the Phillies led 6-0 by the second inning. Howard made two headfirst dives during the romp -- the All-Star first baseman has an RBI in all seven of Philadelphia's playoff games this year, a record streak in a single postseason.	"He's a big-game player," Werth said. "We've got a lot of guys like that here, guys that thrive in big situations."	The Phillies came up with the most-lopsided win in their postseason history. Joe Blanton starts Game 4 Monday night against Randy Wolf, who hasn't pitched since the opener of the division series against St. Louis.	"You never want to get your rear end kicked," Dodgers manager Joe Torre said. "But you don't toss and turn and wonder if you made the right move. It's still only one game and we're in position to tie the series tomorrow."	The next two games in the best-of-seven series are set for Citizens Bank Park.	Howard had three RBIs, including his two-run triple in the first. Werth followed that with a two-run homer, and that was more than enough for Lee.	The reigning AL Cy Young Award winner faced just two batters over the minimum. Lee gave up a pair of singles to Manny Ramirez and one to Ronnie Belliard.	Manuel planned to send Lee out for the ninth until he hit a single in the eighth and scored on Shane Victorino's three-run homer. Chad Durbin relieved to begin the ninth and pitched a perfect inning.	Lee is 2-0 with an 0.74 ERA in three postseason starts, giving the Phillies exactly what they expected when they acquired him from Cleveland in late July.	"I don't know if I ever doubted myself," Lee said. "I always had confidence in myself."	After wasting a brilliant performance by Pedro Martinez in Game 2, the Phillies jumped on Dodgers starter Hiroki Kuroda right from the start.	On a brisk 46-degree night -- almost half the temperature at Dodger Stadium for Game 3 Friday -- Philadelphia's hitters had no trouble swinging hot bats. Every starter except Raul Ibanez had a hit and all nine starters scored a run.	Victorino's home run to deep right field put an emphatic exclamation mark on the rout. The shot also let Phillies outscore the city's NFL team -- the Eagles lost 13-9 to the Oakland Raiders.	Making his first start in 20 days, Kuroda only got four outs. He allowed six runs and six hits. Dodgers manager Joe Torre chose Kuroda over Chad Billingsley even though Kuroda was unavailable for the first-round series against St. Louis because of a herniation in his cervical spine.	"They put me on the mound and I have to come through, but I didn't," Kuroda said through a translator.	A sellout crowd of 45,721 made Kuroda uncomfortable from the start. Fans waved their "Fightin' Phils" rally towels and chanted "Beat LA! Beat LA!" even before the first pitch was thrown.	Ramirez got an earful, too. Fans screamed "You took steroids!" before he struck out in the seventh inning.	Victorino, who exchanged words with Kuroda in the NLCS last year after a fastball buzzed his head, got things started in the first. Victorino singled with one out and stole second. Chase Utley followed with a single. Howard then ripped a liner into the right-field corner to score both runners. The 255-pound slugger chugged around the bases and dove headfirst into the third for his first career postseason triple.	"It was one of those things where I had to make up my mind," Howard said. "Once I hit second, I was going for it."	Werth made it 4-0 with a long drive that landed in the shrubs in almost straightaway center.	Carlos Ruiz started the second with a double and scored on Jimmy Rollins' one-out double that chased Kuroda. Scott Elbert came in and walked Victorino and Utley. Howard's RBI dribbler put the Phillies up 6-0. Howard slid headfirst into first on that play, too, trying to avoid the tag.	When the Phillies were in the field, all eyes were on Utley after he committed two costly throwing errors on double-play balls in the first two games. Utley bounced his first throw to first base, but Howard made the scoop. But he made a couple routine throws later and drew some cheers.	Game notes	 Howard extended his postseason streak of reaching base to 16 games. ... Former Phillies Vicente Padilla and Randy Wolf were booed during NLCS introductions. Former shortstop and manager Larry Bowa received a mixed reaction and there was a nice ovation for former slugging first baseman Jim Thome. ... Victorino lost his bat when it flew into the stands and hit a fan. The team didn't know of any injury.

From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  When Derek Jeter led off Game 3 with a homer into the bullpen, this AL Championship Series seemed uncomplicated. Power hitting and steady pitching appeared to be driving New York to the World Series.	About 261 minutes, 14 pitchers, six homers and several big blunders later, a winning hit by a backup catcher left only one thing certain in this cuckoo series: The Los Angeles Angels won't be trampled by the mighty Yankees.	Jeff Mathis drove home Howie Kendrick with a two-out double in the 11th inning, and the Angels survived a second straight ALCS thriller, beating New York 5-4 Monday to trim the Yankees' series lead to 2-1.	"There was a lot of great baseball on that field this afternoon," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "There were a lot of twists and turns, and both teams played a terrific game. We just got it done at the end."	Kendrick, himself a part-time infielder, homered and tripled before singling with two outs in the 11th off rookie Alfredo Aceves. Mathis followed with his drive up against the left-field wall, and Kendrick slid home well ahead of a desperate throw, setting off an on-field celebration of the backups' bonanza.	Mathis, a .211 hitter in the regular season, came up with his third late-inning, extra-base hit of this outlandish series, just two days after the clubs' 310-minute, 13-inning icy epic in Game 2.	"Obviously, it's the biggest hit of my life," Mathis said. "For Howie to have the at-bat he did right there, and to get on base and put one in the gap to win the game, it's a pretty good feeling."	If the Angels had any lingering doubts about their ability to match up with the big-money Yankees after two discouraging losses in the chilly Bronx, those worries melted during their comeback in the balmy Orange County sun.	"Man, that was one of the craziest games," said Angels outfielder Torii Hunter, who lamented his 1-for-5 effort. "It was an emotional roller coaster, man. We were up, we were down. I've got a headache right now, but it was a lot of fun. Both teams were battling and we came through in the end. As long as you have innings and outs left, you've got a chance to make something happen."	Game 4 is Tuesday night, with CC Sabathia pitching on three days' rest against Angels newcomer Scott Kazmir. Game 5 in the best-of-seven series is Thursday.	Vladimir Guerrero hit a tying two-run homer as the Angels overcame a 3-0 deficit and four solo homers by the Yankees' stars, including Jorge Posada's tying shot in the eighth. Bobby Abreu made a big baserunning mistake, Joba Chamberlain flopped, and Mariano Rivera made a gutsy stand with the bases loaded in the 10th before Kendrick and Mathis made it all academic with two quick hits against Aceves, the Yankees' eighth pitcher.	Mathis entered Game 3 in the eighth, and had a leadoff double in the 10th.	"You wouldn't think Jeff Mathis would be the guy that beats us, but top to bottom, they're a good lineup," said Yankees reliever Phil Hughes, who got five outs and finished the ninth.	For the second straight game, the Angels and Yankees played into tense extra innings, stretching nerves and bullpens still frayed from Saturday's marathon New York victory at Yankee Stadium.	"This is the type of series we expected it to be," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "We didn't really stretch out any of our pitchers too far today out of the bullpen, so I believe our guys will be fine tomorrow."	Los Angeles wasted a golden opportunity in the 10th after putting runners at the corners with nobody out against Rivera, but the ace closer came through yet again, getting Hunter and Guerrero with the bases loaded. Fans gathered across the country at Yankee Stadium erupted in cheers when Rivera retired the side -- but the Angels came through in the 11th after winner Ervin Santana retired the Yankees.	"Anyone who thought we were going to breeze through a series with the Angels is crazy," said New York's Mark Teixeira, who finished last season with Los Angeles. "This is a great team, and they came to play today."	The Angels ended their six-game ALCS losing streak. The Yankees had been 5-0 in this postseason, starting with a sweep over Minnesota.	The Yankees had a 3-0 lead midway through the fifth on homers by Jeter, Alex Rodriguez and Johnny Damon. Andy Pettitte also appeared to be cruising toward his record 16th career postseason victory, which would have put New York one win from its first World Series in six years.	Instead, Kendrick hit a fifth-inning homer, Guerrero tied it with a two-run shot in the sixth, and Kendrick tripled off Chamberlain before scoring on Maicer Izturis' sacrifice fly in the seventh to put the Angels ahead 4-3.	But Posada tied it again in the eighth with a shot to center off Kevin Jepsen. Jeter stranded two runners to end New York's eighth, and Los Angeles' Abreu was tagged out moments later while retreating to second base after his long double to center.	Only three teams have blown a 2-0 lead in a league championship series, but the 2004 Yankees are in that trio. After taking a 3-0 lead against Boston that infamous fall, the Yankees lost 13 of their next 17 postseason games before winning their first five this year.	Many fans hadn't even settled into their Angel Stadium seats for Game 3 when Jeter ripped Jered Weaver's third pitch into the bullpen beyond the left-field fence for his third career leadoff homer in the postseason. Rodriguez connected in the fourth for his 11th career postseason homer. He already has nine RBIs in these playoffs, a career best.	The 37-year-old Pettitte, a mainstay of New York's playoff efforts since 1996, has made the most postseason starts (37) and pitched the most innings (231) in baseball history. He yielded seven hits and one walk, but Los Angeles' two mid-game homers made him the first Yankees starter to allow more than two runs in this postseason.	Weaver gave up five hits and three walks in five innings, failing to recapture the dominance of his two-hit start against Boston nine days earlier.	Angels closer Brian Fuentes pitched a hitless ninth, showing no effects from Rodriguez's tying homer in the 11th inning of Game 2. Manager Mike Scioscia ordered an intentional walk for Rodriguez with nobody on base and two outs, a move that paid off when pinch-hitter Jerry Hairston Jr. struck out.	Game notes	 Posada apparently asked Angel Stadium officials to turn on the lights midway through the game, played under partly cloudy skies. ... Abreu was 0 for 11 against his former team before his sixth-inning single.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Alex Rodriguez limited the celebration of his latest playoff homer to a brisk trot and a few high-fives. CC Sabathia barely even pumped a fist while mowing down the Angels for eight innings.	Even while they shined at a pivotal point in the AL Championship Series, the slugger and the workhorse starter seemed determined to stick to business.	Although none of the Yankees' 26 World Series championships included these two stars, their no-nonsense excellence in a 10-1 victory on Tuesday night put New York one win from routing the Los Angeles Angels and playing for another title.	"We just need to close it out," Sabathia said simply. "It's that time."	Rodriguez homered in the third straight game of his outstanding postseason, Sabathia pitched five-hit ball on three days' rest, and the Yankees took a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven ALCS with superstars living up to their big contracts.	Johnny Damon added a late two-run homer for the Yankees, who could sew up their first trip to the World Series in six years with a win in Game 5 on Thursday night at Angel Stadium. New York's A.J. Burnett faces Angels ace John Lackey.	Rodriguez had three hits and scored three runs, while Melky Cabrera drove in four for the Yankees, who built a commanding cushion in this once-wild series by draining the drama from it.	One day after the Angels handed New York its first playoff loss in an extra-inning thriller, the Yankees put together two early rallies before piling on five runs late -- all backed by Sabathia's steady work in his second win of the series.	"This team's good. We have great players, Hall of Fame players," said Sabathia, who has won three of the Yankees' seven playoff games. "We've got all the confidence in the world."	With a two-run homer to left field that silenced an excited Anaheim crowd in the fifth, Rodriguez drove in a run in his eighth straight postseason game, tying the major league record. It was his fifth homer in New York's seven postseason games, matching Reggie Jackson's iconic 1977 effort for the second-most homers in a single playoff year for the Yankees.	"Well, the game slows down for you, no doubt about it," said Rodriguez, who is 6 for 16 with three homers and five RBIs in the ALCS. "You feel like you want to see the ball and hit it hard and not try to do too much, but the best way I can describe it is you feel like the game is slowing down."	Bernie Williams holds the New York record with six homers in 1996, but that mark seems ripe to be toppled by A-Rod in the first phenomenal postseason for a superstar who mostly sputtered in October until now.	Rodriguez also singled and scored New York's first run in the fourth, and he doubled and scored on an error in the ninth to cap his do-it-all day.	"He did something different," Angels outfielder Torii Hunter said of Rodriguez. "I think he's shorter with his swing and being patient, a lot more patient. He looks different at the plate. He definitely wants it. You can tell by the way he's swinging. That guy's a bad guy, man. I wish he was on my team."	After playing 24 innings over 9 1/2 hours and making a coast-to-coast flight over the previous three days, both teams needed a snappy victory. Sabathia came through for the Yankees, providing rest for New York's taxed bullpen while further frustrating Los Angeles' lineup, which is foundering in the playoffs after an outstanding regular season.	Sabathia was 2-3 with a 7.92 ERA in five playoff starts with Cleveland and Milwaukee before this season, but he's been dominant this October. The Yankees' $161 million left-hander yielded two walks and struck out five in Game 4, throwing 101 pitches.	"We've still got a little ways to go, but I've been feeling good," Sabathia said. "I never had any doubt about me being able to perform on this stage and to pitch well late in October, but it seems like people did. But I feel great. You know, hopefully I can keep it going."	After he retired Hunter on a weak grounder to end the eighth, thousands of fans stood up and left Angel Stadium, not sticking around for the final demise of their suddenly punchless club.	Kendry Morales homered for the Angels, whose bats have been mostly awful in the ALCS. The club that had nine .300 hitters in its lineup in mid-August is batting .201 in the series, and the Angels managed just one extra-base hit in Game 4.	"We got beat pretty badly tonight, [but] it was one loss. That's it," manager Mike Scioscia said. "Our guys are confident. There is nobody in that clubhouse that's down. We know where we have to get to, and there's a terrific challenge for us."	Newcomer Scott Kazmir also crumbled in his second straight postseason start for the Angels, allowing six hits and four walks while barely making it through four innings.	After holding the Angels to four hits over eight innings in Game 1, Sabathia pitched on three days' rest for the first time this season, but he's no stranger to extra assignments. He pitched very well on short rest four times for Milwaukee last season while carrying the Brewers into the playoffs, though he struggled once he got there.	Sabathia also would be in position to pitch Game 7 on four days' rest if necessary -- but unless the Angels awaken, it's more likely he'll be fresh for the World Series opener next Wednesday at Yankee Stadium.	New York took the series' first two games at home, including a 13-inning thriller in Game 2. Los Angeles won 5-4 in 11 innings in Game 3, overcoming a three-run deficit and blowing a late lead before Jeff Mathis' winning RBI double.	In Game 4, the Yankees finally slowed a team-wide 3-for-35 slump with runners in scoring position with Cabrera's fourth-inning single, which highlighted a three-run burst that began with Rodriguez's slide home under a tag.	Cabrera later added a two-run double in the ninth -- but Sabathia already had everything he needed even before Rodriguez homered on reliever Jason Bulger's second pitch in the fifth.	Kazmir yielded six hits and four walks while working incredibly slowly. He kept New York scoreless until the fourth, when Rodriguez led off with a single. After Jorge Posada laced a double just inside the left-field line, Robinson Cano grounded to second with one out, but Rodriguez slid in underneath Howie Kendrick's high throw to the plate.	Game notes	 The Yankees already announced plans earlier in the day to put some World Series tickets on sale online Wednesday. ... Kazmir appeared to pick Swisher off second base moments after Cabrera's RBI single, but umpire Dale Scott ruled him safe. ... Morales was 3 for 24 in the postseason until his drive to center in the fifth.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

PHILADELPHIA --  Ryan Howard and the defending champs are back in the World Series -- proving last year was no fluke and looking even more dangerous this time around.	Jayson Werth homered twice, Shane Victorino and Pedro Feliz also connected and the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 10-4 in Game 5 on Wednesday night to win their second straight NL pennant.	Brad Lidge closed it out, Howard was selected NL championship series MVP and the Phillies became the first team to reach consecutive World Series since the New York Yankees in 2000-01.	"I can get used to it," manager Charlie Manuel told a cheering crowd. "We got one more step and we're going to get it!"	Now, Jimmy Rollins and crew wait for their next opponent. They'll go for their third World Series title beginning next Wednesday night at New York or Los Angeles. The Yankees lead the Angels 3-1 in the ALCS, which resumes Thursday night at Angel Stadium.	Meanwhile, slugger Manny Ramirez, manager Joe Torre and the rest of the Dodgers go home after leading the NL with 95 wins in the regular season and sweeping the St. Louis Cardinals in the division series.	"They're confident, they're talented, and they're going where we all want to go right now -- the World Series," Torre said, praising the power-hitting Phillies.	With their latest big night at the plate, Philadelphia overcame another shaky outing by 2008 NLCS and World Series MVP Cole Hamels. Los Angeles closed to 9-4 in the eighth, but Ryan Madson escaped a bases-loaded jam by striking out Russell Martin and retiring Casey Blake on a grounder.	After beating Tampa Bay in last year's World Series, the Phillies are trying to become the first repeat champions from the NL since the Cincinnati Reds in 1975-76. The Yankees were the last team to win consecutive titles when they captured three in a row from 1998-2000.	"We got one more step," Howard said. "Then we got action!"	Andre Ethier, James Loney and pinch-hitter Orlando Hudson hit solo homers for the Dodgers, who also lost to the Phillies in five games in last year's NLCS.	The teams combined to tie the record of seven homers in a postseason game. It was the fifth time that's happened.	"They were better than us," Ramirez said. "You saw what they were capable of doing."	Fireworks exploded over Citizens Bank Park after Victorino caught a fly ball for the final out. The NL East champions, who beat Colorado in four games in the opening round, met Lidge in the middle of the diamond to celebrate and began putting on hats with the stitched-in logo of "WS2009."	Team president David Montgomery led the crowd in a chant of "Charlie! Charlie!" during trophy ceremonies on the field. Then, players retreated to the clubhouse to spray champagne and celebrate.	On the 29th anniversary of their first World Series title, the Phillies became the first NL team to win consecutive pennants since the Atlanta Braves did it 13 years ago.	"Big games call for big times," Werth said. "Hopefully, we can keep it going. We've got four more games to win."	Five pitchers tossed 4 2/3 strong innings in relief of an ineffective Hamels, who hasn't been the dominant ace he was last postseason. Chad Durbin earned the win by retiring all four batters he faced, including Ramirez representing the tying run in the fifth.	Lidge, who has bounced back from a rough season with spotless work in the playoffs, tossed a scoreless ninth.	"I always believed it was going to turn around," he said. "One of the biggest things was I was starting to feel really healthy at the end of the season."	Hamels allowed three runs and five hits in 4 1/3 innings. Still, he got a standing ovation on his way to the dugout.	Vicente Padilla, the former Phillie who was excellent in his first two playoff starts, lasted just three-plus innings and gave up six runs.	Once considered the NL's laughingstock, the Phillies have been thinking dynasty since riding down Broad Street on flatbed trucks during the city's first championship parade in 25 years last October.	So what that they're the team of 10,000 losses? The sad-sack losers of the past are a distant memory in Philadelphia.	This will be Philadelphia's seventh trip to the World Series in 127 years. The Phillies beat Kansas City in 1980 and lost in 1915, 1950, 1983 and 1993. The Yankees swept Philadelphia in '50, winning the first three games of that series by one run.	Another sellout crowd implored their team to "Beat LA!" and waved their white-and-red rally towels, rocking Citizens Bank Park on a beautiful, 63-degree night. It was only 48 on Monday night.	Coming off a dramatic comeback win in Game 4, capped by Rollins' two-run double with two outs in the ninth, the Phillies got it going with two outs in the first. Chase Utley walked to reach safely for the 25th straight postseason game, tying Boog Powell's major league record.	Padilla wanted no part of Howard, who hit .333 with two homers and eight RBIs in the series. He walked him on four pitches after firing three inside fastballs, hoping to make the big slugger a little uneasy.	Padilla then threw three straight balls to Werth. The fired-up crowd roared louder with every pitch out of the strike zone.	After taking two strikes, Werth sent a drive to the seats in right-center for a 3-1 lead. Fans gave Werth a curtain call and another standing ovation when he ran out to right field in the top of the second.	Werth's solo shot off Hong-Chih Kuo in the seventh gave him five homers this postseason and made it 9-3.	"A lot of times we win games just because of our power and the fact that we can hit the ball out of the ballpark," Manuel said. "We need to be a little bit more consistent, and I'd say we can be a better hitting team. But right now for the National League, I think we're outstanding."	Ethier put the Dodgers up 1-0 in the first when he connected on a 1-2 fastball down the middle, sending it into the seats in right-center. Loney's shot in the second also came on a 1-2 pitch, cutting the deficit to 3-2.	Victorino hit a two-run shot to left off Game 1 starter Clayton Kershaw for an 8-3 lead in the sixth.	Game notes	 Dallas Green, manager of the 1980 Phillies championship team, threw out the first pitch to Manuel. Green got a big hug from Dodgers third-base coach Larry Bowa, the shortstop on the '80 team. ... The Phillies are 3-2 against the Dodgers in the NLCS.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Mere moments after the Los Angeles Angels unleashed their leaping, screeching, rambunctious Rally Monkey on the scoreboard, they erased a late deficit and saved their season.	Surely that monkey business was just a coincidence. He's just a marketing gimmick, a video star and a plush toy -- right?	Not to the fans who watched it happen Thursday night in the latest improbability of an AL championship series game. Not to the Yankees, who were three innings away from tickets to the World Series before the Angels snatched them away with a 7-6 comeback victory that cut New York's edge to 3-2.	"Anything is possible, man," Angels outfielder Torii Hunter said. "Baseball is a crazy game, man. You see some crazy things. Every time you come to the game, you've probably been to 1,000 games, and you see something different every year."	Kendry Morales drove in the go-ahead run with a two-out single in the seventh inning as the Angels responded to the Yankees' six-run comeback moments earlier with a three-run rally of their own, each hit more improbable than the last.	When closer Brian Fuentes retired Nick Swisher on a bases-loaded, full-count popup for the final, perilous out, the Angels and their monkey had held on -- and evoked the faintest echoes of the Yankees' last trip to this stage of the postseason, which ended in their unprece-	dented four-game flameout in 2004.	"It's a missed opportunity, but we still have another game," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "We've bounced back from tough losses all year long. We've had it happen to us before and been able to get off the carpet."	Game 6 is Saturday night at Yankee Stadium, with Andy Pettitte facing Los Angeles' Joe Saunders. Also in the forecast: a huge rainstorm.	"It gives them a couple more days of hope, and hopefully that hope ends on Saturday because anything can happen, especially with as tough of conditions as we're going to be playing in," said Johnny Damon, who went 1 for 5. "They still have to beat us two times at our place, and hopefully that's going to be tough to do."	When Robinson Cano jubilantly rolled into third base with a two-run triple to put New York up 6-4 in the seventh, everything in somber Angel Stadium pointed to a clinching victory, a record 40th AL pennant and a date with Philadelphia next week for the Yankees. Surely the season would be forever tainted by manager Mike Scioscia's decision with two outs in the seventh to pull John Lackey, the workhorse starter who dominated New York for six innings.	Instead, the Angels showed off the knack for late-game comebacks they've possessed ever since their run to their only championship in 2002, when the beloved Rally Monkey began appearing in the late innings. Los Angeles set the franchise record with 47 comeback wins this season, and both of their playoff wins over the Yankees were comebacks.	Vladimir Guerrero's single tied it in the seventh for the Angels, who didn't surrender after blowing a 4-0 lead in a must-win game.	"It was definitely a do-or-die situation," said Lackey, who dominated the Yankees for six innings before getting pulled with two outs in the seventh. "Now we've got one more game to go, and hopefully we'll make it to the next one. The guys showed a lot of character tonight, for sure. Having the rough seventh inning and then coming right back and scoring three runs showed a lot about our team."	Although two games in the Bronx -- and shutdown starter CC Sabathia -- still stand in the Angels' way, the collapse raised the slightest reminders of what happened to the Yankees' last big lead in an ALCS. The Red Sox famously rallied from an 0-3 deficit in 2004, making a late rally to win Game 4 before finishing off the biggest comeback in baseball history in seven games.	Only six teams have rallied from a 3-1 deficit to win a league championship series -- most recently in 2007, when Boston came back against Sabathia and Cleveland on the way to a title. Including the World Series, 11 of 70 teams that fell into a 3-1 hole have made the comeback.	Four teams previously have won the final two LCS games on the road.	The Angels hadn't scored a run before the fourth inning of any playoff game this fall until they jumped on Yankees starter A.J. Burnett, who yielded eight hits and three walks.	Lackey, soon to be among the sport's most coveted free agents, cruised through the first six innings after Los Angeles scored four in the first, and the ace reacted with audible disappointment when Scioscia pulled him from what might be his final start with his only team.	Lackey left to a standing ovation with a tip of his cap -- and the Yankees probably were cheering, too.	Reliever Darren Oliver yielded a three-run double to Mark Teixeira -- 3 for 21 in the ALCS at that point -- on his first pitch, and Hideki Matsui added a tying single.	Incredibly, it wasn't over -- and Burnett shared the blame with his bullpen. Altogether, the seventh inning featured nine runs and 63 pitches over nearly 45 minutes.	Jeff Mathis and Erick Aybar reached base to chase Burnett, the big-money free agent who's still winless in three postseason starts. After Mathis scored on Bobby Abreu's RBI groundout, Guerrero's dribbling single against reliever Phil Hughes eluded a diving Derek Jeter to tie it -- and Morales put the Angels ahead with the latest clutch hit of his breakout season.	"That's not a forgiving team over there," Scioscia said. "They hit pretty quick in that inning with six runs, and we bounced back and answered with three. In the dugout between innings, guys were still pumped up. Just some real good hitting."	Jered Weaver, who started Game 3 for the Angels, pitched a hitless eighth before Fuentes barely escaped the ninth. After two quick outs, he intentionally walked Alex Rodriguez with nobody on base before walking Matsui and hitting Cano with a pitch to load the bases for the slumping Swisher, who battled Fuentes for seven pitches before popping out.	"My hair is falling out," said the shaved-headed Hunter, who had a two-run single in the first. "We're having a little fun, man. Everybody thought we were down."	Game notes	 In the latest instance of questionable umpiring in a postseason chock-full of it, Damon appeared to beat Lackey to first base on a bang-bang play to end the third inning, but Dale Scott ruled him out. ... Wearing a Yankees cap, "Escape From New York" star Kurt Russell was at Angel Stadium more than two hours early to watch batting practice. ... Mathis set the club's playoff record with hits in six straight at-bats. He had a single in the second inning, a double in the fifth and another single in the seventh.

NEW YORK --  They dashed from the dugout and in from the outfield, swarming Alex Rodriguez in a sea of pinstripes only steps from his spot at third base.	"I couldn't be more excited," he said. "I feel like a 10-year-old kid."	Making it to the World Series for the first time after all those misses will do that to you.	The New York Yankees, baseball's biggest spenders, finally cashed in with their first pennant in six years Sunday night, beating the Los Angeles Angels 5-2 in Game 6 of the AL Championship Series behind the savvy pitching of that old October pro, Andy Pettitte.	Next up, New York hosts defending champion Philadelphia in the World Series opener Wednesday night. Cliff Lee is expected to face ALCS MVP CC Sabathia in an enticing pitching matchup between former Cleveland teammates -- and the past two AL Cy Young Award winners.	Ridiculed in the past for his October flops, the three-time MVP played a huge role in helping his team advance through the playoffs, batting .438 with five home runs and 12 RBIs. Thriving under late-inning pressure this time around, the slugger earned his first trip to the Fall Classic during a 16-year career in which he's accomplished almost everything else.	"That's what you play for," Rodriguez said. "In order to win a World Series, you have to get there first."	Cameras flashed in the stands throughout the ninth inning as the crowd roared louder and louder with each pitch.	After Mariano Rivera fanned pinch-hitter Gary Matthews Jr. for the final out at 1 minute past midnight, Mark Teixeira, Derek Jeter and most Yankees rushed to mob a jubilant Rodriguez near third base.	Rivera received a huge hug from catcher Jorge Posada in front of the mound. Then, Rodriguez and the Yankees partied with beer and bubbly in their swanky, high-tech clubhouse.	"I feared that I wouldn't be able to contribute, so I had a lot of limitations," Rodriguez said about his previous playoff failures. "The whole year for me was about trusting my teammates and being one of the guys."	Pettitte set a postseason record for wins, Johnny Damon hit a two-run single and Rivera closed it out in familiar fashion with a six-out save as the $201 million Yankees won their 40th American League crown by vanquishing the Angels, a longtime nemesis.	"It's really not a surprise that we are here. I hate to sound like that," said Sabathia, signed along with fellow free agents Teixeira and A.J. Burnett in a $423.5 million offseason spending spree.	Now, the Yankees go for their record 27th title -- when manager Joe Girardi was hired two years ago, he took jersey No. 27 with that in mind.	Not a bad way for Jeter, Posada and crew to finish up the first season at the team's new $1.5 billion ballpark. As Yankee Stadium grew dark, Sabathia's and Girardi's kids ran around the bases on an empty infield.	"We want to enjoy this tonight. We'll worry about Philly tomorrow," Jeter said. "Hopefully, we can play one more great series."	For manager Mike Scioscia and his sloppy Angels, it was their latest playoff failure during a decade of steady regular-season success. Since winning their only championship in 2002, the Angels are yet to return to the World Series despite five AL West titles in the past six years.	"At times we played good baseball. At times we shot ourselves in the foot," Scioscia said.	After rain postponed Game 6 for a day, the clear weather and mild, 58-degree temperature at first pitch was a stark change from the first two games of the series, when the Angels froze up in the raw chill at Yankee Stadium.	Pettitte escaped a jam in the sixth, going to 3-0 on Kendry Morales before knocking down a comebacker with runners at second and third to preserve a 3-1 edge. The left-hander pumped his fist, then headed for the dugout.	With one on and one out in the seventh, Pettitte left to a standing ovation and tipped his cap to the sellout crowd of 50,173, the largest at the new ballpark. He earned his 16th postseason win, breaking a tie with John Smoltz, and his fifth to close out a postseason series -- also a major league record.	"We've got a lot of confidence in Andy when he's on the mound. He's been a big-game pitcher for us for 14 years," Jeter said.	Joba Chamberlain got two key outs and Girardi went to a well-rested Rivera in the eighth. He gave up a two-out RBI single to Vladimir Guerrero, making it 3-2, then retired Morales to end the inning.	A diving play by Teixeira at first base helped Rivera avoid further damage.	It was the first earned run allowed at home by the 39-year-old Rivera in a postseason save situation. But the Yankees added two insurance runs in the eighth on a pair of Angels errors and Teixeira's sacrifice fly.	Rivera finished up for his record 37th postseason save, and the Yankees had their elusive pennant.	"You bring him in, you feel like the game's over. He's the best," Pettitte said.	Rodriguez reached base all five times up and drew a bases-loaded walk in the fourth that put New York ahead 3-1. Earlier in the inning, Damon gave the Yankees the lead with a single off 16-game winner Joe Saunders.	Including their unprecedented collapse against Boston in 2004, the Yankees had lost five straight times with a chance to close out an ALCS -- and six in a row with an opportunity to end a playoff series.	But this time, New York got it done with leadership from Jeter, Pettitte, Rivera and Posada, all part of the late 1990s dynasty under manager Joe Torre.	As for Rodriguez, his tumultuous year began with a tense news conference to admit steroids use from 2001-03 with Texas, then hip surgery that sidelined him until May.	It will end in the World Series.	"Pretty incredible, especially with all the stuff I've been through this year," he said. "I just felt very happy and very blessed, and all I cared about this year was winning games."	Normally airtight on defense and fundamentals, the Angels made eight errors in the series and several other uncharacteristic mistakes. The miscues continued early in the clincher, when Saunders walked five in 3 1/3 shaky innings and Guerrero was doubled off first base on a shallow fly.	With no Rally Monkey bouncing around the video board in the Bronx, Los Angeles failed to pull off one of its signature comebacks. The Angels trailed in all eight of their playoff victories against New York, including a stirring 7-6 triumph in Game 5 on Thursday night that extended the series.	Looking to lock up the pennant, the Yankees turned to a familiar source of success in Pettitte. The 37-year-old left-hander delivered, allowing only one run for his second closeout win of these playoffs. He also beat Minnesota to complete a first-round sweep.	Always a picture of poise and focus in October, narrowed eyes peering between his cap and glove as he takes his signs on the mound, Pettitte also owns postseason records with 38 starts and 237 1/3 innings pitched.	Pettitte was pitching at home for the Yankees in the postseason for the first time since their last World Series game, a 2-0 loss to Josh Beckett and the Florida Marlins in 2003.	This one was a different story.	"They beat us fair and square," Angels outfielder Torii Hunter said. "It's just frustrating right now."	Game notes	 The Phillies won two of three at Yankee Stadium in May. ... Rodriguez has hit in 11 straight postseason games. ... The Yankees are 5-0 at home this postseason.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

NEW YORK -- The ho-hum catch that tickled his teammates, the behind-the-back snag that looked so easy.	Cliff Lee could have been clowning around with his kids. Hard to believe it was Game 1 of the World Series at Yankee Stadium, of all places.	Lee outdueled CC Sabathia, Chase Utley homered twice and the Philadelphia Phillies kept rolling through October, beating New York 6-1 on a misty Wednesday night in the opener.	"To be honest I really never have been nervous in the big leagues. This is what I wanted to do my whole life," Lee said.	The defending champion Phillies shut down Alex Rodriguez & Co. in the first Series game at the new billion-dollar ballpark. Trying to become the first NL team to repeat since Cincinnati in 1975-76, the Phils' 17-4 postseason run is the best in league history.	Big Red Machine, meet the New Red Machine.	"We have confidence. We know we have a good team," Utley said.	Game 2 is Thursday night, with wily Pedro Martinez pitching for the Phillies against jumpy A.J. Burnett.	Lee bamboozled the Yankees with a spiked curveball, deceptive changeup and his usual pinpoint fastball, pitching a six-hitter while striking out 10 without a walk.	The lefty blanked the Yankees until a run scored on shortstop Jimmy Rollins' throwing error in the ninth inning. Lee improved to 3-0 with an 0.54 ERA this postseason.	He really seemed to enjoy himself, too.	"Game time is the time go out there and have fun and let your skills take over. It's kind of weird. Boils down to confidence and trusting your teammates," he said.	If Lee felt any anxiety in his Series debut, facing the team that led the majors in wins, homers and runs, it didn't show. And if the Phillies were supposed to be intimidated by the pictures of Babe Ruth and all the Yankees greats on the giant videoboard, it didn't happen.	Pitching in short sleeves on a blustery evening, Lee worked a wad of gum while he worked his spell over the Yanks.	Lee did a lot of the work himself. When Johnny Damon hit a little popup to the mound, Lee merely stuck out his glove hand to the side and caught the ball as if it were an apple falling from a tree.	"You know, it was pretty cool," Lee said. "It was 15 feet in the air. Pretty simple catch. It came right to me."	That play left the Phillies laughing. Later, he made a nifty, behind-the-back stop on Robinson Cano's one-hopper. He threw the ball to first and shrugged. Easy.	That play stumped Ryan Howard.	"I was like ... wow. Am I missing something? It was so nonchalant, so casual," the Phillies first baseman said.	Said Lee: "I try not to go over the edge and be cocky."	Howard reprised his NL championship series MVP performance, doubling twice and driving in the final run. Barely looking like the 2-to-1 underdogs they are, the Phillies were in such control that many fans left before the final out.	Lee beat his good friend and former Cy Young teammate Carsten Charles Sabathia in the first game at this ballpark back in April, and got this chance after the Phillies traded four minor leaguers to Cleveland in July to get him.	Rodriguez went hitless and struck out three times in his Series debut.	"I did keep it simple today. He kept it even more simple," Rodriguez said. "He threw the ball well. When a guy comes out like that, you tip your cap and move on. He made some pretty good pitches."	Derek Jeter did the most damage against Lee, doubling and singling twice.	"He was great. He's been pitching like that the whole year, the last two years, the postseason," Jeter said. "I don't think it's much of a surprise."	So Game 1 went to the Phils. But as Yankees manager Joe Girardi observed, "One thing, he can't pitch every day."	Playing in their 40th World Series, and first in six years, the Yankees went quickly. "As the game went on, it got quieter," Utley said.	Utley's solo home runs in the third and sixth innings gave Lee all the support he needed. Raul Ibanez hit a two-run single in the eighth and Shane Victorino added an RBI single in the ninth.	The Phillies' may have been a bit overdue -- in their only other October meeting, the Whiz Kids from Philadelphia got swept by the Yankees in the 1950 World Series and totaled just five runs.	Even though he's an All-Star, Utley was an unlikely candidate to rock Sabathia, the MVP of the ALCS. Utley was 0 for 7 with five strikeouts against the big Yankees lefty going into the game.	Utley won a nine-pitch duel with Sabathia in the third, pulling a 95 mph fastball barely over the right-field wall. The shot was the first by a left-hander allowed by Sabathia at home this year.	Utley struck again in the sixth, sending another 95 mph heater deep into the right-center field bleachers.	Phillies manager Charlie Manuel had little to do except watch from the top step of the dugout. Girardi was busier, bringing in five relievers after Sabathia left following the seventh inning with Phillies ahead 2-0.	First lady Michelle Obama and Jill Biden were among the crowd of 50,207, as were a few specks of fans dressed in Phillies red. Yankees owner George Steinbrenner watched from an upstairs box -- he has yet to see his team win in the palace he built.	After a rocky postseason, umpires faced just one tricky call and got it right. They huddled after Rollins trapped a popup and threw to first, and correctly ruled it a double play.	Game notes	 Utley set a postseason record by safely reaching in his 26th straight game, breaking a tie with Baltimore's Boog Powell. "I didn't know that happened," he said. ... Before Utley, the only other left-handed hitter to homer twice off a lefty pitcher in a Series game was Babe Ruth in 1928 off Bill Sherdel of the Cardinals. ... The last six teams to win the Series opener won the title. ... Rodriguez fanned three times in a game for the first time since July 30. The last pitcher to strike him out three times in a game was Cole Hamels of the Phillies on May 24. ... The Yankees went 64-36 in Series games at their old park.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK -- Mark Teixeira and Hideki Matsui shook the New York Yankees from their lumber slumber and sent the World Series to Philadelphia all tied up.	Teixeira and Matsui hit solo homers off familiar foe Pedro Martinez, backing a sharp performance by A.J. Burnett and giving the Yankees a 3-1 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies in Game 2 on Thursday night.	"After yesterday, getting a win today was big," Teixeira said.	A night after getting stopped by Cliff Lee in the opener 6-1, the Yanks bounced back from an early deficit, sparked by a pickoff throw from backup catcher Jose Molina, and won in the Series for the first time since taking a 2-1 lead against Florida in 2003.	After a day off, Game 3 will be at Philadelphia on Saturday night. The Phillies had been hoping for more than a split but were content.	"I always like to be 2-0 over 1-1. But it is what it is," manager Charlie Manuel said. "I've got to accept it."	Light-hitting Matt Stairs put the Phillies on top with an RBI single in the second. Burnett then used a biting curveball to keep Philadelphia from advancing another runner past second base against him.	Teixeira, in an 8-for-44 (.182) postseason slump, tied the score when he led off the fourth by driving a high changeup into the Yankees bullpen in right field.	"I think the home run got the crowd back in it," Teixeira said. "It kind of put a little bit of a crack in their armor."	Matsui put New York ahead with two outs in the sixth, reaching down for a curveball below his knees and sending it a few rows into the seats in right.	"I was able to make a good adjustment and put a good swing on it and fortunately it led to the result," he said through a translator.	Jorge Posada pinch hit in the seventh and added an RBI single off Chan Ho Park.	Burnett got his first win following three postseason no-decisions for the Yankees, allowing four hits in seven innings and retiring his last eight batters.	"He went to his bread-and-butter, that backdoor curveball. It's impossible to hit," Stairs said.	Burnett struck out nine, -- including Ryan Howard three times -- and started his first 11 hitters with strikes, nine of them looking. Burnett kept his control, walking two, one of them intentional.	"I just wanted to come out and set the tone early and be very aggressive," Burnett said. "My key was strike one tonight."	After Game 1, he was walking in the clubhouse kitchen and heard Lee talk about confidence during an on-field interview.	"He talked about belief in his stuff, and all I told myself last night and today was the same thing," Burnett said. "I went out tonight with confidence, and just, you know, the game just rolled by."	Mariano Rivera got six outs for his 38th postseason save, his 10th in World Series play. After the Phillies put two on with one out in the eighth, Game 1 star Chase Utley grounded into an inning-ending double play. He fanned Howard looking starting the ninth -- the Philadelphia slugger's first four-strikeout game since July 21 -- then struck out Stairs with a runner at second to end it.	Several moves by Yankees manager Joe Girardi paid off.	Molina made his fourth straight postseason start as Burnett's personal catcher and picked off Jayson Werth at first base after a leadoff single in the fourth -- the Phillies next-to-last baserunner off Burnett.	"It got him through that inning," Girardi said. "I thought it was extremely important."	Jerry Hairston Jr. made his first postseason start for the Yankees as the replacement for Nick Swisher, batting just .114 (4 for 35) in the postseason. Hairston, who hadn't started in right field since July 21, had good numbers against Martinez (10 for 27) but had not faced him since 2004.	Philadelphia, seeking to become the NL's first repeat Series champion since the 1975-76 Reds, lost for just the fifth time in 22 postseason games.	New York won despite getting nothing from Alex Rodriguez. After carrying the Yankees in the playoffs against the Twins and Angels, he is 0 for 8 in his first Series appearance and struck out three times for the second straight night.	"I know he'll bounce back," Girardi said. "We'll get it going with him in Philly."	When the Series resumes, Cole Hamels starts Game 3 for the Phillies against Andy Pettitte in an all-lefty matchup. Both teams will be making the trip through New Jersey by train.	Twenty-eight of the 53 teams that won Game 2 to tie the Series went on to win the title -- but just one of the last six, the 2002 Angels.	There was another umpiring controversy. With two on and one out in the seventh, first base ump Brian Gorman ruled Howard reached down, caught Johnny Damon's liner and turned a double play. A slow-motion replay appeared to show the first baseman gloved the ball on a short hop.	Martinez, pitching four days past his 38th birthday, was nearly as effective as the 32-year-old Burnett, fooling the Yankees with breaking pitches of 70-75 mph. He allowed three runs and six hits in six-plus innings, striking out eight and walking two.	"I knew it was going to be crazy," Burnett said. "I knew he was going to be on his game. I focus on myself, but you can't help but watch his game. It's the funnest I've had on the field."	There were a few muted chants of "Who's Your Daddy?" but nothing like the booming taunts that serenaded Martinez when he came to New York in his final weeks with Boston in 2004. That was after he famously said, "I just tip my hat and call the Yankees my daddy" following a loss at Fenway Park.	After Hairston singled and Melky Cabrera's hit-and-run single put pinch-runner Brett Gardner on third with no outs in the seventh, Martinez came out, pointing at the sky, tapping a fist on his heart and smiling at the crowd.	"I know they really want to root for me. It's just that I don't play for the Yankees, that's all," said Martinez, who hasn't been feeling well and was winded. "They love the fact that I compete. I'm a New Yorker, as well. If I was on the Yankees, I'd probably be like a king over here."	Philadelphia broke on top when Raul Ibanez blooped an opposite-field double just on the left-field line with two outs in the second. Stairs followed with a one-hop single off the glove of Rodriguez at third. A-Rod could have come up with the smash by Stairs, who had been in a 4-for-51 (.078) slide dating to July 1.	New York has lost consecutive home games just once since mid-June. Now the Turnpike Series moves down the road.	"Our club has been resilient all year," Girardi said. "The one thing that we've been able to do is we've went through some tough losses and we've seemed to bounce back. It was just business as usual for us today."	Game notes	Derek Jeter was presented the Roberto Clemente Award, given annually to a player who combines community service with excellence on the field. ... Utley walked in the second and has reached in a record 27 consecutive postseason games since going 0 for 4 in his debut in 2007. ... Ibanez made a diving catch on Robinson Cano with a runner at first in the second to prevent a possible RBI double.

The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

PHILADELPHIA -- Guess who showed up for Halloween dressed as sluggers?	The New York Yankees and Alex Rodriguez, whose double clanked off a television camera in the right-field corner and was ruled a home run in the first instant replay call in World Series history.	It changed the game.	"I think it woke our offense up a little bit," Rodriguez said after the Yankees rallied for a rain-delayed 8-5 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Saturday night that gave them a 2-1 Series lead.	Rodriguez and the rest of those dangerous New York bats finally broke loose to back another postseason win by Andy Pettitte.	Game 4 is Sunday night. Joe Blanton pitches against Yankees ace CC Sabathia, who goes on three days' rest for the second time this postseason.	After pitching dominated the first two games in the Bronx, the Yankees and defending champion Phillies flexed their muscles, combining for six home runs at cozy Citizens Bank Park. Jayson Werth connected twice for Philadelphia.	Rain affected the Series schedule in Philly for the second consecutive year, delaying the start by 1 hour, 20 minutes. Once they hit the field in front of their boisterous fans, the Phillies built a 3-0 lead -- but it was squandered by a struggling Cole Hamels, last year's World Series MVP.	A slumping Nick Swisher and pinch-hitter Hideki Matsui also went deep for the Bronx Bombers, while Johnny Damon hit a tiebreaking, two-run double.	"This was my first time coming to this ballpark. It just seems like you're going to have a slugfest a lot," Swisher said. "It was a great day for us."	Pettitte settled down after a shaky start and even helped himself at the plate with a tying single. His six-inning outing was enough to earn his 17th postseason win, extending his major league record.	"He closed off our left-handed hitters," Philadelphia manager Charlie Manuel said.	Especially slugger Ryan Howard. The NL championship series MVP is 2 for 13 with nine strikeouts in the Series.	"Go home and go to sleep. I'm a simple guy," he said. "We're not going to panic by any means just because we're down in the Series."	Some fans were dressed in Phillies red, others in full costume for the second-ever World Series game on Halloween. They whipped around white rally towels, but the trick was on them -- their team got whipped when the Yankees rallied.	Carlos Ruiz homered for the Phillies in the ninth off Phil Hughes. Mariano Rivera finished up at 12:42 a.m. in a non-save situation.	"It was an absolute grind tonight, that's for sure," Pettitte said. "I can't remember winning a game where I've struggled like I did tonight. So it's very gratifying."	With the Yankees down three runs, Mark Teixeira walked in the fourth and Rodriguez hit an opposite-field drive into the right-field corner. He cruised into second base after the ball ricocheted back onto the field.	Video replays, however, showed the ball struck the lens of a television camera positioned just above the fence at the 330-foot sign. New York manager Joe Girardi came out to talk with right-field umpire Jeff Nelson as Phillies pitching coach Rich Dubee visited the mound.	While Rodriguez chatted with Howard at second base, umpires huddled in the infield. Four of the six went under the stands for a look at the replay and emerged about a minute later.	The signal: home run.	Baseball adopted instant replay for boundary calls during the 2008 season and Rodriguez homered the first time it was used last year.	"It's only fitting, right?" he said.	Rodriguez's first hit in nine World Series at-bats was his sixth homer this postseason, tying Bernie Williams' club record from 1996. It also was the 17th postseason homer this year for the Yankees, setting a franchise mark.	The call seemed to give the Yankees a boost and help them break out of their Series slump -- the team that led the majors in runs (915) and homers (244) during the regular season scored only four times in the first two games at home.	"Tonight I was a lot more disciplined, and better results," Rodriguez said.	New York kept hitting in the fifth and chased Hamels. Benched in Game 2 at home, Swisher opened with a double and slid home with the tying run when Pettitte looped a one-out single to center on a first-pitch breaking ball.	It was Pettitte's third hit in 18 career postseason at-bats, second in World Series play.	Who needs a designated hitter?	The Fox broadcast caught Derek Jeter saying to plate umpire Brian Gorman: "We're going to have to listen to Pettitte now. He's been bragging about his hitting all year."	Jeter fisted a soft single and Damon cracked a two-run double to right-center for a 5-3 lead. Hamels was lifted after another walk to Teixeira and walked off the mound to a mix of boos and cheers.	The lanky left-hander, who was 4-0 with a 1.80 ERA in the postseason last year, fell to 1-2 with a 7.58 ERA in four outings this time around.	Swisher homered off rookie J.A. Happ in the sixth and took a long look at his solo shot to left.	Werth answered leading off the bottom half with a mammoth drive off the facing of the second deck in left. After connecting, he slammed his bat to the ground and glared into the Philadelphia dugout as if to urge on his teammates.	It was Werth's seventh home run this postseason, one shy of the major league record held by Carlos Beltran (2004) and Barry Bonds (2002).	Jorge Posada's RBI single in the seventh gave New York a three-run cushion. Matsui added an opposite-field solo shot to left in the eighth, his second homer in two games.	Matsui was on the bench because World Series rules don't permit a DH in National League parks.	Pettitte fell behind 3-0 in the second. Werth reached down for a breaking ball and hit a leadoff homer to left, setting off fireworks and lighting up the Liberty Bell in right-center.	With the bases loaded, Jimmy Rollins walked to force in a run and Shane Victorino added a sacrifice fly.	Pettitte avoided further damage by striking out Chase Utley, then settled in and held Philadelphia in check. That gave the Yankees a chance to come back.	The Phillie Phanatic was wearing a rain-slicker and fisherman's hat when he high-fived Mike Schmidt as the Hall of Famer walked to the mound to throw out the first pitch to Howard.	The grounds crew was still drying puddles on the warning track as the Phillies took the field.	Last season, Game 5 of the World Series between the Phillies and Tampa Bay was suspended for two days because of rain. Once it resumed -- in the sixth inning -- the Phillies went on to a 4-3 victory that clinched the championship.	Last year's Game 3 started at 10:06 p.m. because of rain and didn't end until 1:47 a.m. It was the latest start in Series history.	Game notes	 The Phillies dropped to 11-2 at home the past two postseasons. ... Nine of the last 10 teams to win Game 3 when the World Series was tied 1-all went on to take the title. The exception was the 2003 Yankees, who lost the next three games to Florida.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.
