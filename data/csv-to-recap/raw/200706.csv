Ninth-place hitter Brandon Inge had a career-high five RBIs.	• Figure this: Glavine gave up nine earned runs for just the second time in his career. The only other time Glavine gave up nine earned runs was May 24, 1999, for Atlanta against the Brewers.	• Quotable: "Like I used to say about Doc Gooden, it's pretty easy to be poised when you've got that kind of talent." -- Jim Leyland on rookie Andrew Miller's ability to pitch out of jams Sunday.	• For the birds: About 50 seagulls were on the field, mostly in the	outfield, during the first inning and about half of them stuck	around for the whole game.	-- ESPN.com news services	Tigers 15, Mets 7	DETROIT (AP) -- Tom Glavine had one of the worst outings of his stellar career against baseball's highest-scoring team.	Gary Sheffield contributed to Glavine's rough day with a homer and an RBI triple Sunday, helping the Detroit Tigers beat up the New York Mets 15-7 and win the series.	Glavine (5-4) gave up nine earned runs for just the second time, matching the career-high total he allowed eight years ago.	Sheffield said it was an uncharacteristic performance from Glavine, who he faced 55 times previously, but fell short of saying Detroit was lucky.	"It's not a fluke," he said. "We're a good team, also."	Brandon Inge had a career-best five RBIs, helping the Tigers score six runs in the fifth inning and four in the eighth, to surpass their previous season high of 14 runs.	Detroit leads the majors with 374 runs, an average of just over six per game.	Manager Jim Leyland, however, is unhappy that his shaky bullpen is leading to softball-like scores for the defending AL champions.	"We have to win games 5-3 and 3-2 like we did last year," Leyland said. "If we don't, we won't be anywhere to be found later on."	In a matchup of an all-time great left-hander and a promising lefty going for win No. 2, the pitcher with 295 career wins had a day he'd like to forget.	"I'm getting tired of talking about the whole 300 win thing," Glavine said. "Everybody thinks that's all I'm thinking about and it's not."	Clearly, Glavine probably has other things on his mind.	Glavine gave up a season-high 11 hits and lasted just 4 1/3 innings -- his shortest outing of the season -- and is 0-3 over his last four starts after beginning the year 5-1.	"He threw the ball well. He felt pretty good, but Tommy didn't locate his pitches," Mets manager Willie Randolph said. "You have to make sure you make good pitches against the Tigers."	The only other time Glavine gave up nine earned runs was May 24, 1999, for Atlanta against the Milwaukee Brewers, and he allowed nine runs total in two other games.	"It was one of those days where no matter what you tried to do, or whatever adjustments you tries to make, it didn't work," Glavine said.	Andrew Miller (2-0) allowed a three-run homer to David Wright in the first inning before settling down -- finishing with four runs allowed, five hits and three walks over 5 1/3 innings.	A year after being drafted sixth overall, Miller made his second start in the majors.	"It's like a movie script," he said. "You wouldn't believe it if somebody told you, but I'm here and I think it's real. You couldn't dream it up better than this."	Leyland was not surprised to see the 22-year-old Miller pitch out of some jams.	"Like I used to say about Doc Gooden, it's pretty easy to be poised when you've got that kind of talent," he said.	Miller left the game with one on, one out and a seven-run lead in the sixth and the cushion quickly was cut after Jason Grilli replaced him.	Grilli gave up three straight hits -- including rookie Carlos Gomez's first homer -- and was replaced after hitting the fourth Met he faced without getting an out. Tim Byrdak got out of the two-on, one-out jam with a strikeout and flyout.	Leyland planned to travel to watch Kenny Rogers throw for Triple-A Toledo on Sunday night in a rehabilitation start and promised other pitchers would be evaluated as candidates to possibly replace relievers later this season.	"They've all shown they can do it and they've all shown they can't do it," he said. "These aren't threats to anybody because we don't have any intention on making a move right now. But at some point, we have to have a better idea what's coming out of there on a consistent basis.	"If we don't, then you look to make changes. It's that simple."	Game notes	 The 15 runs and 21 hits allowed were season highs for the Mets. ... Detroit OF Magglio Ordonez was scratched from the lineup because of minor stiffness in his left knee and said he will play Tuesday at home against the Milwaukee Brewers after the Tigers are off on Monday. ... Mets OF Moises Alou left the team Sunday morning to fly back home for an examination on his strained left quadriceps and another OF on the DL, Shawn Green, is expected to be activated Monday. Mets 1B Howard Johnson was optioned to Triple-A New Orleans after the game. ... Detroit SS Carlos Guillen left the game in the third inning with a right hamstring spasm and wasn't sure if he would be healthy enough to play Tuesday. ... Ivan Rodriguez and Sheffield both hit their first triples of the season. ... Grilli entered the game after pitching 7 2-3 scoreless innings over four games. ... About 50 seagulls were on the field, mostly in the outfield, during the first inning and about half of them stuck around for the whole game. ... Miller started in place of Nate Robertson, who is on the disabled list with a tired arm. ... Wright has homers in four straight games, one short of the franchise record.

No one guy in that lineup shows panic. When they get two strikes, they just grind it out." -- Pirates manager Jim Tracy on the Yankees' lineup.	-- ESPN.com news services	Yankees 13, Pirates 6	NEW YORK (AP) -- Joe Torre offered a simple explanation for his team's recent turnaround.	"Looseness. These guys are having fun with each other," the Yankees' manager said Sunday after New York's sluggers broke loose in a 13-6 victory over the Pirates.	Alex Rodriguez homered twice and drove in five runs, Bobby Abreu went 4-for-4 with three RBIs and the Yankees overpowered Pittsburgh for their sixth consecutive victory.	Abreu and Rodriguez each scored four times and Hideki Matsui hit a two-run double, helping the resurgent Yankees (30-31) set a season high for runs in winning for the ninth time in 11 games. It's their longest winning streak since they won six straight last September.	Torre and several players pointed to a turning point late last month in Toronto, where the Yankees held a team meeting. They were so tight during a five-game skid, it seemed nobody smiled for days. So to loosen everyone up, Torre canceled batting practice one afternoon and told his players to come to the ballpark only an hour before the game.	"Joe sat us all down and talked to us very firmly," Rodriguez said. "I think our mood came, and then the winning came after."	One day after Roger Clemens' successful return, New York completed a three-game sweep and sent the Pirates to their ninth defeat in 12 games. Pittsburgh also was swept at Yankee Stadium in an interleague series two years ago and hasn't won at the ballpark since Game 5 of the 1960 World Series.	"They're hot right now. We just played them at a bad time," Pittsburgh's Xavier Nady said.	Sean Henn (2-0) replaced ineffective rookie Tyler Clippard and worked two scoreless innings for the win. New York's much-maligned bullpen came through, with four relievers combining for 5 1/3 shutout innings.	On offense, the Yankees tagged former teammate Shawn Chacon (2-1), who allowed seven runs and eight hits in 3 1/3 innings.	"They're so patient. They're so disciplined at the plate," Chacon said. "They make you put the ball over the plate and they wait for their pitch."	Abreu tripled, doubled and walked during a perfect day at the dish. New York's 3-4-5 hitters, Abreu, Rodriguez and Matsui, finished 8-for-11 with four walks.	Rodriguez has 18 RBIs in 35 June at-bats after driving home 11 runs in 102 at-bats in May. Abreu is hitting .500 (19-for-38) this month with six doubles, nine RBIs and 10 walks, raising his average from .228 to .272.	"I'm swinging at better pitches right now. I'm more consistent right now. It started in Boston when I got a couple of hits the other way," Abreu said. "I always stay positive."	It was Abreu's seventh multihit effort in 10 June games.	"It's a treat to hit behind him," Rodriguez said, pointing out that Abreu saw about 40 pitches Sunday, an astounding total.	With the Yankees trailing 6-5 in the fourth, Rodriguez greeted reliever Josh Sharpless by driving a 2-0 pitch over the left-field fence for a three-run homer.	A-Rod, who leads the major leagues with 24 homers and 63 RBIs, made it 10-6 with a two-run shot in the sixth off Masumi Kuwata, called up Saturday from Triple-A Indianapolis when reliever Salomon Torres (elbow) went on the disabled list.	"His control is usually pinpoint, but he didn't get the ball in far enough," Pirates manager Jim Tracy said. "They are as good as I've seen, as far as their approach is concerned. No one guy in that lineup shows panic. When they get two strikes, they just grind it out. They are really good."	It was the fourth multihomer game this season for Rodriguez and the 48th of his career. He came out for a curtain call, delighting the sellout crowd of 54,292.	"When you see him hit a home run to right field, he makes it look so easy," Torre said.	The 39-year-old Kuwata became the oldest player to make his major league debut since another Pirates pitcher, 41-year-old Diomedes Olivo, on Sept. 5, 1960, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.	Wil Nieves had an RBI single in the seventh, and Abreu hit a two-run double.	Henn escaped a bases-loaded, one-out jam in the fifth to preserve an 8-6 lead.	New York jumped on Chacon for three runs in the first. Abreu drove in one with his first triple for the Yankees, and Matsui added a two-run double.	Clippard got in trouble after a leadoff walk in the second, and Jose Castillo hit a two-run single.	The Yankees loaded the bases with none out in the third and scored on Melky Cabrera's RBI infield single and Miguel Cairo's sacrifice fly to make it 5-2.	Clippard quickly squandered the lead. He walked two in the fourth and gave up a two-run double to No. 9 batter Chris Duffy, followed by Jose Bautista's two-run single off the left-field fence that put Pittsburgh up 6-5. But Bautista got himself hung up between first and second in a horrendous bit of baserunning and was tagged out easily as he jogged into second.	Game notes	 It was Jason Giambi bat day at Yankee Stadium. ... Kuwata became the first Japanese player in Pirates history.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.
