BALTIMORE -- On a sweltering night at Camden Yards, rookie Gio Gonzalez had more trouble with the heat than with the Baltimore Orioles.	Gonzalez took a five-hit shutout into the seventh inning, Mark Ellis had a career-high five hits and four RBIs, and the Oakland Athletics beat Baltimore 9-1 on Monday night to extend their winning streak against the Orioles to nine games.	The 23-year-old Gonzalez struck out five and allowed seven hits in six-plus innings, but his performance wasn't as easy at it looked.	"I was sitting in the tunnel the whole time, trying to get away from that heat. It was like fighting fireballs," the left-hander said. "I was throwing water on my face, ammonia towels, trying to cool down a little bit."	The pitcher's between-innings ritual wore on Oakland catcher Kurt Suzuki, who, according to Gonzalez, said, "I'm tired of coming out here. Relax."	After giving up two hits to start the seventh, Gonzalez (4-2) was pulled following a rain delay of 52 minutes. When play resumed, Craig Breslow got three straight outs to strand both runners in scoring position.	Gonzalez blanked Texas over 6 2/3 innings in his last start and has won four straight decisions over a seven-game stretch.	"Unless I really shut them out, we didn't have much of a shot anyhow," Baltimore starter Jeremy Guthrie said. "But unfortunately, I did not pitch well."	Guthrie (7-12) allowed five runs and a season-high 11 hits in 4 2/3 innings. The right-hander avoided adding to his AL-high total of 27 homers allowed, but he took over the league lead in losses.	Guthrie lamented his inability to put away batters after getting two strikes in the count, which contributed heavily to his 107-pitch count.	"They fouled them off, fouled them off, then ended up with a base hit," he said. "It was their fault. They didn't put it in play for me tonight, which was unfortunate because they swung at a lot of pitches. Up, down, out, in. I don't know what else I could do."	The Athletics are 4-0 against Baltimore this season, and their nine-game run against the Orioles is the longest in Oakland history. The A's are 64-27 (.703) versus Baltimore since the start of the 1999 season -- the best winning percentage by any AL team against the Orioles in that span.	Luke Scott hit his 19th home run in the ninth inning to ruin Oakland's shutout bid, but the Orioles went 0 for 12 with runners in scoring position and fell to 6-18 since the All-Star break.	"It seems like when we do hit the ball hard, we hit it right at somebody. And it seems like when we get opportunities to make productive outs and drive a run in, we don't," Orioles manager Dave Trembley said.	Oakland used four straight hits to take a 2-0 lead in the second. Tommy Everidge singled and Ryan Sweeney doubled before Ellis and Cliff Pennington delivered RBI singles.	The A's used a three-run fifth to make it 5-0. Singles by Rajai Davis, Jack Cust and Suzuki produced a run before Ellis ended Guthrie's night with a two-out, two-run single to left.	In the ninth, Suzuki doubled in a run, Sweeney hit a two-run double and Ellis finished his big night with an RBI double. Ellis was rested in Oakland's previous game, and break seemed to be beneficial.	"Sometimes, a day off helps," Ellis said. "It can really refresh you."	Game notes	 Oakland RHP Justin Duchscherer, who's yet to pitch this season due to a sore right elbow, threw 85 pitches in a rehab assignment at Triple-A Sacramento on Sunday. ... Orioles rookie C Matt Wieters started a fifth straight game for the first time, but Chad Moeller will start Tuesday, manager Dave Trembley said. ... Baltimore's Nick Markakis has reached by hit, HBP or walk in 31 straight games, the longest active streak in the majors.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

NEW YORK -- The Blue Jays parted ways with popular teammate Alex Rios in the visitor's clubhouse just before the first pitch Monday night, their task of slowing down the streaking New York Yankees made that much more difficult.	The Yankees had won seven straight, and were fresh off their first four-game home sweep of bitter rival Boston in 24 years. Their pitching had been dominant, their offense explosive.	Leave it to the Toronto bullpen, of all things, to turn the game upside down.	Lyle Overbay and Aaron Hill hit solo homers, and the Blue Jays' gritty relief corps made a meager lead stand up in a 5-4 victory that gave Toronto its first three-game winning streak since the last week of June.	"We did a good job, got their starter out of there, but their bullpen came in and did a real solid job," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "They shut us down."	And they did it without Rios, a two-time All-Star who was claimed off waivers by the Chicago White Sox just before the first pitch.	It was a cost-saving move on the part of the Blue Jays, who shed the outfielder's hefty salary and now have some financial flexibility for the offseason.	"As I told him, it's not like someone didn't want him," Blue Jays manager Cito Gaston said. "There was a team over there that really wanted him and I'm sure that he will do well."	Shawn Camp (1-5) picked up the win in relief of ineffective starter Marc Rzepczynski, who allowed three homers and didn't make it out of the fourth inning. The Blue Jays bullpen allowed four hits over 5 2/3 innings, helping Toronto win for just the third time in 10 tries against the Yankees this season.	Jason Frasor worked around a single in the ninth by Hideki Matsui for his fifth save.	"Pitching did a great job," Hill said. "Frasor's doing his thing. It's always nice to come out with a win, now we have to come out here and do it again tomorrow."	The Yankees, who had their lead in the AL East trimmed to 5½ games over Boston, looked for a while as if they would keep rolling.	Derek Jeter hit a leadoff homer on the third pitch he saw, and Robinson Cano and Jerry Hairston added back-to-back homers in the fourth, before the bats finally went quiet.	Yankees starter Sergio Mitre (1-1), who could be fighting for his spot in the rotation, committed a costly error that led to two runs and wound up allowing five total in five innings.	He got into trouble in the third, when Hill homered off the top of the wall in left field for the first run allowed by a New York starter in more than 24 innings.	Before the Blue Jays took the field again, plate umpire Paul Schrieber quietly ejected Gaston -- keeping him from watching the fireworks in person.	The Yankees regained the lead on a sacrifice fly by Nick Swisher, before Toronto scored three times in the fourth inning. Overbay walked and Vernon Wells singled before Jose Bautista hit a hot shot at Mitre, who made a nice backhanded snare but threw wide to second. Cano could not gather it in, the ball trickled away and Overbay scored easily.	"I made three mistakes, two home runs and the bad throw to second base," Mitre said. "The ball was hit hard, so it got to me quick, so I double-pumped trying to get a grip. If we make that double play, the game is 4-2."	Instead, Edwin Encarnacion added a sacrifice fly and Joe Inglett an RBI triple.	"A miscue cost us the game," Girardi said flatly.	The homers by Cano and Hairston were the 12th back-to-back for the Yankees this season, and second in as many games, after Johnny Damon and Mark Teixeira did it in the eighth inning of a 5-2 victory over the Red Sox on Sunday night.	Overbay's go-ahead homer in the fifth came on a 3-2 count with two outs, and soared over the Yankees bullpen before bouncing just below the first row of seats in deep right field.	Rzepczynski, who was charged with the loss against the Yankees last week, allowed four runs on seven hits in 3 1/3 innings. Even though he was long gone, the Blue Jays managed to win for only the second time in the seven games he's started.	Game notes	 The Blue Jays did not get a player for Rios. Rather, the White Sox assume his entire contract. ... Yankees INF Cody Ransom, who was designated for assignment, signed a minor league contract and will go to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.
