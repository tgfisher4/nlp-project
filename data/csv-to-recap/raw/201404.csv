MINNEAPOLIS --  By the time Dan Straily took the mound for the second inning, he knew he just didn't have it.	His velocity nowhere to be found, the 25-year-old right-hander took the next step in his maturation process by gritting his teeth, focusing on location and changing speeds over anything flashy and shutting down the Minnesota Twins.	Straily pitched three-hit ball for seven innings and Sam Fuld hit a rare home run to help the Oakland Athletics complete a three-game sweep with a 6-1 victory Thursday.	"It's part of learning from the past, from last year," said Straily (1-1), who gave up one run and struck out five. "On days when I didn't have my best stuff, I would try to pitch like I did and it would cost me. After the second inning, I realized I didn't have my `A' stuff in my arm today. So it was just a matter of mixing speeds and keeping everybody off balance.	The Athletics' rotation has opened the season with nine straight starts allowing three runs or less and has compiled a 1.93 ERA in 56 innings.	"They've done a great job. So far, so good," Josh Donaldson said of the rotation. "Can't really complain about what they've done. That's what we expect from them."	Fuld hit just his sixth homer in 738 career plate appearances and singled. Donaldson had a two-run homer and an RBI single for the Athletics (6-3).	Mike Pelfrey (0-2) gave up six runs on nine hits and four walks in five innings. The Twins have had only one quality start in their first nine games.	Brian Dozier hit his third home run of the season for Minnesota.	Straily was selected in the 24th round of the 2009 draft, just another in the seemingly endless line of young, strong starting pitchers churned out by Billy Beane's Moneyball machine.	Last year he led all AL rookies in starts, innings and strikeouts, and he brushed off the early homer to Dozier to slow down the Twins for the rest of the game. He allowed two baserunners -- both on walks -- over his final five innings	"It wasn't his best velocity," manager Bob Melvin said. "He was throwing basically 87 mph today. But he's always got that slider in his pocket. He threw a few more changeups today and a few more curveballs, so he kept them off balance more than he typically pitches."	Pelfrey had no such luck, laboring through another poor outing for Minnesota's starting rotation. Donaldson's homer in the third inning put him behind 3-1 and he walked No. 9 hitter Nick Punto in the fourth before Fuld yanked a pitch just over the wall in right field for a 5-1 lead.	"I think all the way around, I was terrible today," Pelfrey said.	The cushion allowed the A's to avoid a save situation on the same day Melvin demoted struggling closer Jim Johnson, who is 0-2 with an 18.90 ERA in five appearances this season. The A's will go with a closer-by-committee approach while they try to get Johnson straightened out, Melvin said.	"We're all pulling for the same thing. We're all in it together," Straily said. "It's just a brotherhood mentality that we have in this clubhouse. It's something special."	Game notes	 The announced attendance of 20,650 was the smallest in Target Field history. ... Umpires reviewed a play in the sixth inning in which Jed Lowrie was thrown out at home by Twins CF Aaron Hicks. Umpires were looking to see if C Josmil Pinto was illegally blocking the plate. The call of an out was confirmed. ... Twins assistant GM Rob Antony said star prospect Byron Buxton likely will not start playing until May because of a wrist injury. ... The Twins open a series against Kansas City on Friday night. RHP Kyle Gibson (1-0, 1.80) will start the opener against Royals LHP Bruce Chen (0-0, 1.42). ... The Athletics head to Seattle for a series against the Mariners. LHP Tommy Milone will make his first start of the season on Friday night against Mariners RHP Felix Hernandez (2-0, 1.88).	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CHICAGO -- Pedro Alvarez stepped to the plate ready to strike in a big spot.	Once again, he delivered.	Alvarez hit a three-run homer to cap a five-run seventh inning and Jason Grilli retired Emilio Bonifacio on a bases-loaded grounder to end the game, giving the Pittsburgh Pirates a 5-4 victory over the Chicago Cubs on Thursday.	The Pirates trailed 4-0 heading into the seventh, but two big drives changed things.	Pinch hitter Travis Snider cut the deficit in half with a two-run homer off Brian Schlitter. Alvarez put Pittsburgh ahead with his three-run shot on the first pitch from James Russell (0-1), his third homer in two games and fifth this season.	"Just trying to be ready from pitch No. 1, ready to compete, and sometimes that first pitch is the best one you see and just trying to be ready to hit as soon as I step in the box," Alvarez said.	Chicago threatened in the bottom of the ninth before Grilli retired Bonifacio on a grounder to first. Pittsburgh took two of three at Wrigley Field.	That gave the Pirates their third series win -- the most for them to start the season since the 1992 team took its first six.	Gerrit Cole (2-0) struck out 10 in six innings. He also allowed four runs, three of them earned.	Tony Watson worked a perfect seventh. Mark Melancon retired the side in the eighth before things got tense against Grilli in the ninth.	Grilli gave up a leadoff walk to pinch hitter Ryan Sweeney and a single to Starlin Castro, putting runners on first and second. Grilli then struck out Luis Valbuena and Welington Castillo before Darwin Barney walked to load the bases.	Bonifacio, who came into the game with a .500 average after going 19-for-38, ended it with that grounder to first baseman Travis Ishikawa, giving Grilli his third save in four chances.	Chicago's Travis Wood sailed through six-plus innings, allowing four hits, striking out nine and walking three. He left to cheers with a four-run lead after Neil Walker led off the seventh with a double.	Snider, batting for Clint Barmes, then drove a two-run homer to the shrubs in center off Schlitter, cutting it to 4-2. Schlitter also gave up a single to Starling Marte and walked Andrew McCutchen with two out before Alvarez drove the first pitch from Russell off the roof of a party suite beyond the bushes in center.	"It's tough, especially as well as Woody pitched," Russell said. "You never want to mess up (an outing) that he had. It's one of those deals. It's why we play the game. It happens. We live to see another day."	With a 1-0 lead going into the fourth, the Cubs took advantage of a wild pitch while scoring three more runs.	Anthony Rizzo and Nate Schierholtz singled leading off. Castro drove an RBI single through the left side with one out, and Schierholtz came home on a wild pitch to Mike Olt.	The lead grew to 4-0 when Castro scored on Castillo's two-out single. The throw from Marte in left beat the runner by several strides, but plate umpire Mark Carlson called him safe.	Carlson told a pool reporter that Castro's foot touched the plate before catcher Tony Sanchez had control of the ball. He also said, "If he has the ball securely, he would have been able to block the plate."	Manager Clint Hurdle came out of the dugout to discuss the play, but obstruction "never came up."	He also chose not to challenge but would not say why.	"If I give you any other answer, we got 10 more questions," Hurdle said.	Game notes	The Pirates said top pitching prospect Jameson Taillon had Tommy John surgery on his right elbow Wednesday. He is expected to miss 12 to 18 months. ... The Cubs open a three-game series at St. Louis on Friday, and manager Rick Renteria was asked whether he sees the Cardinals as a model for what Chicago is trying to do. "It's hard to argue with a club, an organization, that's had success over the years," he said. "You've got to see what it is that they do and don't do. You take things from every organization in baseball, but certainly, they've had a tremendous amount of success over the last few years -- and over their existence."	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

WASHINGTON -- After Stephen Strasburg failed to get out of the fifth inning in his second start this season, he had a little chat with Nationals teammate Ian Desmond about changing his approach on the mound.	"It was just: I don't need to go out there and trick guys, and I don't need to go out there and be perfect," Strasburg recalled. "I just got to attack the strike zone, let my stuff work."	Consider it done. In his third -- and by far the best -- outing of 2014, Strasburg struck out 12 in 6 2/3 innings on a day Washington really needed to rest its relievers, and Desmond and Jayson Werth homered, leading the Nationals past the Miami Marlins 7-1 Thursday for a three-game sweep.	"We actually talked after his last start, and he told me some things that he wanted to work on. And to see him go out and execute it today, exactly the way he wanted to change and what he was going to mess with, was pretty good to see," said Desmond, whose grand slam off reliever Arquimedes Caminero in the eighth broke open a tight game. "That's maturity. Everyone forgets how young he is. He's going to keep on getting better and better and today was proof of that."	The 25-year-old Strasburg (1-1) got 14 consecutive outs in one stretch and allowed only three hits, including Marcell Ozuna's homer in the seventh. The right-hander's lone walk was to the last batter he faced.	Washington's starter Wednesday, Jordan Zimmermann, left after a career-low 1 2/3 innings, leaving the bullpen "taxed," as manager Matt Williams put it. The Nationals won that game 10-7 on Werth's go-ahead grand slam in the eighth, and this time he connected in the third -- a two-run shot off Tom Koehler (1-1) that put Washington ahead 2-0.	Werth hit a 3-0 pitch just to the left of straightaway center. After driving in a total of one run over the season's first seven games, Werth has seven RBIs in the past two.	"Got the green light from Matty," Werth said, referring to the manager. "Got a pitch up that was elevated and put a good swing on it."	Said Koehler: "Got to do a better job of ... executing."	Strasburg lasted 4 1/3 innings in his previous start, a 6-2 loss to Atlanta on Sunday, and he entered Thursday 0-1 with a 6.10 ERA. But with the temperature 67 degrees at the unusual 4:05 p.m. start, and shadows creeping across the diamond, he was much better against Miami, mixing a 95-96 mph fastball with a seemingly unhittable changeup.	"You have to be in swing mode, expecting fastball, certainly," Williams said. "His changeup was really good off of it today and he used it a lot."	Some Marlins hitters did say the shadows were problematic.	"It was kind of tough to see out there," said Derek Dietrich, who was 0 for 3.	Still, the outset was inauspicious for Strasburg. Christian Yelich led off the game with a single up the middle, stole second and took third on an error. But he got caught in a rundown when he tried to head home on Dietrich's comebacker.	There wasn't another baserunner for Miami until shortstop Desmond booted Adeiny Hechavarria's grounder for an error in the fifth. But Strasburg struck out Jeff Mathis looking at a 95 mph fastball to end the inning, then hopped off the mound.	In the sixth, the Marlins' best hitter, Giancarlo Stanton, faced Strasburg with two aboard and one out in a 2-0 game.	"Any ball he puts in play can take somebody's head off," Strasburg said.	But Strasburg struck out Stanton looking, then got cleanup hitter Garrett Jones swinging at a high fastball for his 10th K -- the 13th time the No. 1 overall pick in the 2009 amateur draft had at least that many in a game.	Stanton's next at-bat came in the eighth against rookie Aaron Barrett, who struck him out with a slider.	"He's a bulldog," Strasburg said about Barrett. "He's not scared of anybody."	Game notes	Nationals pitchers struck out 17 Marlins batters, tying both franchises' records. ... The Nationals open a three-game series at Atlanta on Friday, with RHP Tanner Roark (1-0, 3.00) facing Braves RHP Julio Teheran (1-1, 2.77). The Marlins head to Philadelphia, where RHP Jose Fernandez (2-0, 0.71) will start against Phillies RHP A.J. Burnett (0-1, 3.86).

NEW YORK -- This much is clear: Michael Pineda had a dark substance smudged on his pitching hand during his first win for the New York Yankees.	Pine tar or dirt? We might never know.	Pineda took a two-hit shutout into the seventh inning, and Jacoby Ellsbury hit an RBI single off old roommate Clay Buchholz in his first game against the Boston Red Sox. The Yankees' 4-1 victory Thursday night left a bit of a mystery: Were Pineda's pitches plain old nasty, or was something more sinister involved?	"It's dirt," Pineda said. "Between the innings, I'm sweating too much, my hand. I'm putting dirt -- I'm grasping the dirt. ... I'm not using pine tar."	Ellsbury drew all the pregame attention after switching sides in the rivalry during the offseason. But it was the dark brown, seemingly tacky substance on the lower palm of Pineda's right hand that became the focus.	Close-up camera shots showed Pineda (1-1) pitching during the early innings with something on his hand, and there was speculation it was pine tar to help him get a better grip on a chilly night. The game was never stopped for an umpire to examine him, and it whatever it was, it was gone by the fifth.	"I became aware of it in the fourth inning through the video that someone had seen," Red Sox manager John Farrell said. "And then, when he came back out for the fifth inning, it looked, based on where it was told to me it was located, it looked like the palm of his right hand was clean."	Buchholz and fellow Red Sox ace Jon Lester both attracted questions last year about substances they had on the mound, but nothing came of them.	"The Red Sox didn't bring it to our attention, so there's nothing we can do about it," umpire crew chief Brian O'Nora said. "If they bring it to our attention, then you've got to do something."	Yankees manager Joe Girardi essentially repeated the same answer five times during his postgame news conference.	"I never saw it. There's nothing really for me to talk about," he said.	Making his first Yankee Stadium start 27 months after he was acquired from Seattle, Pineda appeared completely recovered from the shoulder surgery that sidelined him for two years. Throwing at up to 95 mph, he allowed four hits, struck out seven and walked two.	Brian McCann ended an 0-for-14 slide with a run-scoring single that put the Yankees ahead during a two-run fourth that also included a run-scoring double-play grounder by Alfonso Soriano.	Making just his third big league start after 554 games in the minor leagues, 27-year-old infielder Dean Anna homered as New York made it 4-0 in the fifth.	Anna opened spring training wearing No. 93 after six minor league seasons with San Diego, which traded him to New York in November. Now wearing a more respectable No. 45, he was greeted after the homer by Yankees captain Derek Jeter, who gave him a high-five. Anna had received more than 100 emails and texts by the time the game ended, and he even got the ball back.	"Words can't explain it. Honestly, they really can't. All the history with these two teams," Anna said.	This was slightly different than the way he dreamed it would happen.	"In Wrigley Field, actually," he said. "But Yankee Stadium against the Red Sox I think is pretty good, too."	After spending nine years in the Red Sox organization and winning World Series titles in 2007 and last year, Ellsbury left for a $153 million, seven-year contract with the Yankees. And his first game put him at the plate against Buchholz (0-1), his roommate at Lowell of the New York-Penn League in their first summer of professional ball.	On a 1-for-4 night, Ellsbury reached on third baseman Jonathan Herrera's fielding error and scored the game's first run in the fourth. He singled sharply to left to drive in a run in the fifth.	Daniel Nava led off the seventh with a home run into the second deck in right, and Xander Bogaerts' single chased Pineda.	With David Robertson on the disabled list and Shawn Kelley and Adam Warren unavailable after pitching Wednesday, the Yankees scrambled their bullpen. Cesar Cabral and David Phelps retired Boston's last nine batters -- striking out five -- and Phelps got seven outs for his first career save.	"I just figured as long as I was keeping guys off base, they were going to let me go," Phelps said. "Any time you can get a first, as long as it's a good first, is always exciting."	Game notes	Jeter went 2-for-4 with a double, raising his average to .290. ... The Yankees employed an unusual shift with Grady Sizemore up: Jeter remained at shortstop and rookie Yangervis Solarte moved from third to the first-base side of second. Sizemore grounded out to Solarte in the third. ... CC Sabathia (1-1) is slated to face Lester (0-2) in Friday's second game of the four-game series.

From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PHILADELPHIA --  The Milwaukee Brewers used a big offense on their way to an undefeated road trip.	Carlos Gomez had three hits with an RBI and the Brewers extended their winning to six games with a 6-2 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Thursday night.	The Brewers' wins have all come on the road during the streak. They came to Philadelphia following a three-game sweep at defending World Series champion Boston.	"It sure was (impressive)," Brewers manager Ron Roenicke said of the trip. "Great pitching, some big hits, bullpen's doing a great job. Everything's working. Guys are getting some big hits right now."	They battered the Phillies with 25 runs and 38 hits in the three-game sweep. Milwaukee has batted .320 and has outscored opponents 42-18 during the streak.	"We're scoring some early and then getting to those late innings and adding on," Roenicke said.	Ryan Braun had two hits and an RBI, ending the series 6 for 12 with 10 RBIs while increasing his lifetime total to 24 RBIs in 21 games at Citizens Bank Park. Braun opened the series by homering three times in Tuesday's 10-4 win.	Khris Davis had two hits and two RBIs for the Brewers, who return home to host Pittsburgh on Friday night. Milwaukee's 6-0 road start is its best since starting the 1987 season 7-0.	"It was kind of a whole team effort on this trip and we're excited to keep it going," said Jonathan Lucroy, who doubled.	Marco Estrada (1-0) allowed two runs and five hits in six innings, striking out six and walking two, to earn the victory.	"Not only with our pitching, but with our offense, it was well played overall," Estrada said. "It's the way you want to do it, we're hitting, we're pitching, it's the way we just have to keep doing it. Obviously, it's tougher on the road to do, but we did it. It just shows what kind of team we are. We're a pretty good team."	Marlon Byrd homered and had two RBIs for the Phillies, who lost their fourth straight.	"The good news is they are leaving town," Phillies manager Ryne Sandberg said. "Now we have to concentrate on gaining some momentum starting (Friday)."	Philadelphia's Chase Utley had two hits after returning from a two-game absence because of the flu. Utley batted .458 with two homers and six RBIs in his first six games prior to the illness.	Cliff Lee (2-1) struck out eight and walked none, but he also allowed eight hits that resulted in three runs in six innings. Lee has allowed 29 hits in three games.	"They're a good hitting team and they showed it in the whole series," Lee said. "They flat-out beat us."	Byrd's shot to left in the second put Philadelphia ahead 1-0.	The Brewers took the lead with a pair of runs in the fourth on Aramis Ramirez's RBI double and Davis' RBI single. Milwaukee added a run in the sixth on Davis' two-out RBI double.	Philadelphia responded with a two-out run in the bottom of the sixth when Byrd beat out a chopper to third with the bases loaded. Estrada then got Domonic Brown to fly out to center to end the bases-loaded threat.	Milwaukee added three runs in the seventh. The Brewers got some help when Carlos Ruiz elected to throw to second on pinch-hitter Logan Schafer's sacrifice bunt intended to move Rickie Weeks to second. Ruiz's throw pulled shortstop Jimmy Rollins off the bag and put runners on first and second with no outs to set up the big inning.	Defensive miscues have been a problem all season for Philadelphia, which entered with nine errors in eight games and several plays, such as Ruiz's, that haven't been ruled errors but have been costly miscues.	Gomez singled home Weeks, Jean Segura drove in Estrada and Braun's sacrifice fly scored Gomez. All three runs were charged to righty reliever Jeff Manship, who faced three batters without recording an out.	Milwaukee extended its club record of consecutive innings with a hit to 22 innings when Braun singled to right with two outs in the first. Lee retired the Brewers in order in the second, striking out the side, to end the streak.	Brown made an excellent diving catch to take a hit away from Scooter Gennett in the ninth. It was the third diving catch off the bat of Gennett in two games.	Game notes	 The victory gave Milwaukee its first sweep of the Phillies in Philadelphia. ... Cody Asche's eighth-inning error gave Philadelphia 10 errors in nine games. Only the Dodgers and Marlins, each with 11, entered Thursday with more fielding miscues than Philadelphia among NL teams. ... A.J. Burnett (0-1, 3.86) faces Miami RHP Jose Fernandez (2-0, 0.71) at 7:05 Friday night when the teams open a three-game series in Philadelphia. ... Milwaukee returns home to face Pittsburgh at 8:10 Friday night with Brewers RHP Wily Peralta (0-0, 3.60) opposing Pirates LHP Francisco Liriano (0-1, 3.00). ... Philadelphia will call up Phillies RHP Jonathan Pettibone to start Saturday's game against the Marlins.

TORONTO --  With an assist from the broadcast booth, the Houston Astros battered R.A. Dickey's knuckleball on Thursday night.	Robbie Grossman and Jonathan Villar homered off Dickey and the Astros avoided a three-game sweep, beating the Toronto Blue Jays 6-4.	The Astros prepared to face Dickey by taking swings in an indoor cage before the game against former major league knuckleballer Steve Sparks, now a Houston radio announcer.	It's the same strategy manager Bo Porter employed before his team faced Dickey in Toronto last July 27. In that game, Houston had five runs and seven hits off Dickey in six innings, but couldn't hold a lead and lost 12-6.	"I think it always helps," Porter said. "It's not every day that you face knuckleball pitchers. We are fortunate to have Steve come out and be willing to get in the cage. I think it paid dividends today."	Villar hit a three-run homer, Grossman had a two-run shot and Jason Castro added a solo shot as the Astros won for just the second time in eight games.	Grossman, who was hitless in 25 at-bats before taking Dickey deep, took 15 to 20 swings against Sparks and said the session was helpful.	"I have to give credit to Sparksie on that," Grossman said. "Just seeing it, because you never see it."	Villar connected on the first pitch he saw from Dickey in the seventh inning for his second of the season.	Grossman homered on a 3-0 pitch from Dickey in the fifth for his first of the season.	Castro connected off reliever Esmil Rogers to begin the eighth for his second of the season.	Dallas Keuchel pitched seven strong innings for the Astros. Keuchel (1-1) allowed one run and five hits, walked two and struck out six.	"He was outstanding," Porter said. "He did a really good job of attacking the strike zone."	Keuchel has pitched at least seven innings in all three career starts against Toronto.	"The high fastball was working for me today," the left-hander said. "I wasn't really trying to mix and match, I was just trying to attack."	After Chad Qualls worked a scoreless eighth, the Astros struggled to close it out in the ninth.	Josh Fields got two outs, but left after pinch hitter Adam Lind's two-run double. Anthony Bass came on and got Melky Cabrera to hit a grounder, but Bass' high throw to first allowed Lind to score. Maicer Izturis ended it by grounding to the mound, giving Bass his first save.	Colby Rasmus hit his first home run of the season for Toronto, a solo drive in the fifth.	Dickey (1-2) was moved up a day to face Houston on regular rest, with right-hander and fifth starter Dustin McGowan moved back to start Friday's game at Baltimore. Dickey allowed five runs and six hits in seven innings. He walked three and struck out four.	"It's a real surprise when I have a knuckleball like that and we have the outcome that we had," Dickey said.	On Thursday, Dickey walked two batters but didn't allow a hit through the first three innings, a streak that ended when Castro singled to begin the fourth.	Marc Krauss doubled to begin the fifth and, one out later, Grossman homered.	Rasmus cut the lead in half in the bottom of the inning, but Houston chased Dickey with a three-run seventh. Matt Dominguez hit a one-out double, Grossman walked and Villar followed with a drive to center.	Dickey allowed a career-worst 35 home runs in 34 starts last season, the second-highest total in the majors behind Oakland's A.J. Griffin (36). Dickey had not allowed a homer in his first two starts this season.	Game notes	 Cabrera doubled twice, extending his hitting streak to 10 games. ... Blue Jays LH J.A. Happ (back) allowed one run and four hits in 4 2/3 innings in a rehab start at Triple-A Buffalo. Happ walked two and struck out six. ... Toronto begins a three-game series at Baltimore Friday, with McGowan (0-1) facing Orioles RH Chris Tillman (1-0). ... The Astros visit Texas on Friday, with RH Scott Feldman (2-0) facing RH Yu Darvish (1-0).	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ATLANTA -- Eric Young Jr. is proving he's an important part of the Mets' winning formula.	That's especially important with New York's outfield about to become more crowded.	Young got three hits, stole three bases and scored four times as the Mets overcame Justin Upton's two home runs to beat the Atlanta Braves 6-4 on Thursday night.	Young stole five bases in the series as the Mets won two of three from Atlanta.	"He's such a great kid, you root for him all the time, and tonight he showed you he can win games for you," manager Terry Collins said.	Young has joined Curtis Granderson and Juan Lagares in the Mets' outfield. Chris Young could be moving closer to making his return from the disabled list with a right quadriceps injury.	Soon Collins could face difficult decisions in the outfield.	"No question about it," Collins said, adding that Eric Young "makes things happen."	"We saw it tonight," Collins said. "The guy creates runs."	"We talked about it all spring and all winter, what Eric Young brings to the table. When he gets on base he scores runs. He showed it again tonight."	Young had two steals in the Mets' 4-0 win on Tuesday night.	"Anytime you do your job at the top of the lineup, especially with a couple of guys behind me driving me in, it's a lot of fun," Young said.	The Mets broke a 4-all tie in the seventh. Luis Avilan (1-1) gave up a leadoff single to Daniel Murphy, who scored on a two-out single by Juan Lagares off Gus Schlosser. Murphy drove in three runs with three hits.	Carlos Torres (2-0) allowed only one hit in two scoreless innings. Jose Valverde pitched a perfect ninth for his second save.	Led by Young, the Mets stole five bases, their highest total since May 28, 2011, against Philadelphia. Young also used his speed to lead off a two-run third inning with a bunt single.	"Young scored four runs by himself," said Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez, who added, "that pretty much beat us."	Upton drove in three runs with three hits. He had no homers before his breakout game. He hit an opposite-field homer in the second inning before his long two-run blast to left field in the third.	"Tonight I was just comfortable," Upton said. "The only thing I can do is try to take that same exact feel to tomorrow night and the next day and try to make something of it."	Older brother B.J. Upton hit a triple after receiving pregame batting tips from former Braves star Chipper Jones.	Justin Upton's second homer gave the Braves a 4-3 lead.	Mets starter Jenrry Mejia, obviously frustrated, slapped his mitt and then appeared to throw the glove to the grass.	"I just threw my hand up and the glove went out of my hand," he said.	Mejia gave up four runs in five innings on six hits and four walks. Atlanta's David Hale also had control problems as he gave up four runs, three earned, in 4 1/3 innings on five hits and five walks.	The Mets tied the game in the fifth on a leadoff triple by Young and Murphy's single. The Mets loaded the bases on two walks by Hale, but reliever Anthony Varvaro struck out Lagares and ended the inning on Travis d'Arnaud's groundout.	Ike Davis was 0 for 3 with two walks and a RBI in his start at first base. Collins said Lucas Duda, who had a pinch-hit single in the eighth, is still the starter.	Braves shortstop Andrelton Simmons was held out with a jammed right wrist. He said he hurt the wrist in a home-plate collision in Wednesday night's game. He is day to day.	Ramiro Pena, making his first start of the season, replaced Simmons and had one hit.	Game notes	Former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, sat near the Braves' dugout. ... Hale is Atlanta's first starting pitcher to give up more than two runs this season. ... Young was 2 for 2 with two singles in an extended spring game in Port St. Lucie. ... RHP Dillon Gee will be on the mound when the Mets open a weekend series at the Angels, who will start LHP Tyler Skaggs, on Friday night. ... Atlanta RHP Julio Teheran will face Washington RHP Tanner Roark as the Braves' homestand continues.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

CHICAGO -- Chicago White Sox manager Robin Ventura knows the reason behind rookie Jose Abreu's power surge.	"I've been working with him in the cage the last couple of days," Ventura joked.	Abreu had his second multihomer game in three days Thursday night by hitting tape-measure drives in the second and fifth innings and drove in three runs as the White Sox snapped a 14-game losing streak against Cleveland, beating the Indians 7-3.	"He's really good," Ventura said. "That's a simple fact, that he's a good hitter. He hits things hard, and when he hits it hard, they go a long way, whether it's left field or right field. He's doing it for us."	The Cuban slugger hit the first two homers of his major league career Tuesday in Colorado.	Abreu has four homers and 14 RBIs in 10 games.	Alexei Ramirez homered and drove in three runs for Chicago. The Indians had outscored the White Sox 102-45 in a streak that dated to last June.	White Sox starter John Danks (1-0) got off to a rocky start but settled down to allow three runs and six hits in six innings.	"The third inning on, I felt like I was able to throw the ball where I wanted to," Danks said. "I kept it down better. It was a kind of a tale of two games.	"Like I've said, I've never had a bad win."	Indians starter Danny Salazar (0-1) struck out 10 in 3 2/3 innings. He also gave up five runs and six hits, including homers by Abreu and Ramirez.	Salazar's problem was that when the White Sox made contact, it was solid.	"Well, it's an interesting linescore," Indians manager Terry Francona said. "He obviously had really good stuff to have so many strikeouts, but because there was a lot of swing and miss and he was also not hitting his spots all of the time, he was up with a lot of pitches, a lot of deep counts, and they saw a lot of pitches. Then when he made a mistake because they've seen so many pitches, they did some damage to them."	Cleveland gave Salazar to a 2-0 lead by scoring twice in the top of the first.	Abreu homered to lead off the bottom of the second to cut the lead in half, but Asdrubal Cabrera got the run back with a homer leading off the third.	The White Sox tied it at 3 in the bottom of the third on a leadoff homer by Ramirez and an RBI single by Adam Eaton.	Chicago took a 5-3 lead and chased Salazar in the fourth as Ramirez drove home a pair with a double.	Abreu later homered to left field off left-handed reliever Josh Outman.	"Those guys did a great job," Danks said of the White Sox hitters. "I put us in an early hole. They have no quit. This is a fun team to be on. The guys are gonna play until the last out. We saw that today. They didn't hang their heads. They went to work."	Game notes	With INF Lonnie Chisenhall beginning a three-day paternity leave Thursday, the Indians called up Justin Sellers from Triple-A Columbus. "Lonnie will rejoin us Sunday," manager Terry Francona said. "His wife is having the baby at 7 a.m. (Friday). He gave us a heads-up a while back just so we could plan for it. The rule in place now is good. A guy should be back with his wife or family and you shouldn't be short-handed." ... The Indians went 17-2 against the White Sox last season. "We felt like they should have given us a playoff share," Danks said. ... In the second game of the series Friday night, the White Sox send ace LHP Chris Sale (2-0) to the mound against RHP Carlos Carrasco (0-1).	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Tony Campana and Cliff Pennington made the most of their rare starts for the Arizona Diamondbacks.	Campana drove Pennington in with the go-ahead run on an RBI single with two outs in the 10th inning to lead the Diamondbacks to their first back-to-back wins of the season with a 6-5 victory over the San Francisco Giants on Thursday night.	"It's just us being ready," Campana said. "We both kind of kept our routine the same. You kind of come in every day ready to play. Today we got the start and both did a pretty good job at the plate and got the win."	Campana had a career-high four hits and Pennington added three, including a two-run single as both players made just their second starts of the young season.	"They're not rookies, and they prepare themselves properly," manager Kirk Gibson said. "They were ready to play tonight."	Miguel Montero also drove in two runs for the Diamondbacks, who won the final two games of the series.	Michael Morse hit a two-run double that gave the Giants the lead, but an error by third baseman Pablo Sandoval allowed the tying run to score in the eighth and San Francisco fell in extra innings to lose their first home series since August against Boston.	Pennington hit a one-out single off Yusmeiro Petit (0-1) in the 10th and then stole second base on a 2-2 pitch to Campana with two outs. Campana then blooped a single just over the outstretched glove of second baseman Brandon Hicks to score the go-ahead run.	"It took some pressure off once he got to second," Campana said. "I knew I just had to get it through the infield somehow. Got jammed and got over his head barely."	J.J. Putz (1-0) pitched a scoreless ninth for the win, and Addison Reed got three outs for his third save in as many chances.	The Diamondbacks failed to score in the seventh after loading the bases with no outs but got the tying run an inning later on Sandoval's bad throw.	With runners on first and second and two outs in the eighth, Campana hit a slow grounder to Sandoval, who rushed his throw to first. The ball sailed over Brandon Belt's head, allowing Gerardo Parra to score the tying run from second.	"You have to keep your poise," manager Bruce Bochy said. "He got in a rush mode there. With the game on the line, you have to be a bit more cautious. You have to know the situation."	Sandoval had a chance to make up for that mistake in the bottom half but couldn't deliver. The Giants loaded the bases with one out with help from a fly to center that Campana misjudged to give Brandon Crawford a leadoff double.	Belt hit a fly ball to left field that was not deep enough to let Crawford tag from third. Sandoval then flied out to deep right to end the inning.	The Diamondbacks jumped on top early against Ryan Vogelsong with a two-run single by Pennington in the second inning and a two-run double by Montero in the third to take a 4-1 lead.	The Giants' hitters chipped away after the early deficit, getting a run in the third on the first bunt single of Buster Posey's career when he surprised Arizona with a two-out bunt with Angel Pagan on third.	Back-to-back doubles by Morse and Crawford to open the fourth made it 4-3, and Morse's double off Will Harris in the fifth gave the Giants the lead.	Game notes	Arizona manager Kirk Gibson unsuccessfully challenged a play at second base in the first inning when Campana was caught stealing to end the inning after a strikeout to Paul Goldschmidt. ... The Giants held a pregame ceremony honoring their former home, Candlestick Park, which is set to be torn down later this year. ... Madison Bumgarner (1-0) takes the mound for the Giants on Friday when they open a series against Colorado. ... Brandon McCarthy (0-1) is set to take the mound for Arizona on Friday in the opener of a three-game series against the Los Angeles Dodgers.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BALTIMORE --  Dustin McGowan has endured injuries and operations, long stints on the disabled list and countless rehab assignments to keep his baseball career afloat.	It all paid off Friday night, when the Toronto right-hander earned his first victory since 2008 with an effective and emotional effort at Baltimore.	McGowan allowed five hits over 6 1/3 innings, and the Blue Jays used two unearned runs to beat Chris Tillman and the Orioles 2-0.	Making his second start since September 2011, McGowan (1-1) walked one, hit two batters and struck out two. He had faced the Orioles 13 times previously -- going 0-3 with a 6.99 ERA and allowing 50 hits in 37 1/3 innings.	McGowan spent time on the disabled list in each of the last six seasons. He had shoulder surgery in 2008 and 2010 and missed the entire 2012 season. In his debut this year, he didn't make it out of the third inning in a loss to the New York Yankees.	Against Baltimore, however, McGowan allowed only one runner past second base.	"It's kind of a sentimental night, you know, one of those deals," Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. "He's come a long way and he answered the bell. He had a rough one, his first one, and he bounced back tonight against a good-hitting ballclub. Yeah, it's very rewarding for not only him but for everybody that knows him."	The 32-year-old McGowan couldn't have been much happier.	"I think the most important thing is just feeling good," he said. "I got the opportunity to pitch again and that's all I could ask for. Just trying to make the best of it."	After McGowan left, Brett Cecil got five straight outs and Sergio Santos worked a perfect ninth for his fourth save.	It all added up to McGowan's first win since June 22, 2008.	"He's always been one of the top guys here since he got drafted by the Blue Jays," Gibbons said. "The organization has expected big things out of him. He's had some tough luck along the way. Who knows how the season will finish out? But he's off to a good start, that's for sure."	Tillman (1-1) allowed three hits over eight innings, lowering his ERA to 0.84. But the right-hander received no offensive support from his teammates, who were coming off a three-game series against the Yankees in which they collected 40 hits.	Two throwing errors by third baseman Jonathan Schoop provided Toronto with a 2-0 lead in the fourth. Jose Bautista reached on Schoop's first errant toss and came around to score on the rookie's second misfire. Dioner Navarro followed with a potential double-play grounder, but the relay to first base from shortstop Ryan Flaherty skipped past Tillman, allowing another run to score.	"It's baseball. It could have happened early on in the game when I was missing (pitches) and we wouldn't even be talking about it," Tillman said.	Schoop made no excuses.	"I just like threw it away," he said. "I wish I played better defense for Tillman. He pitched a great game. I'll learn from it, be better tomorrow."	In the fifth, Baltimore hit three straight two-out singles to load the bases for cleanup hitter Adam Jones, who flied out to center.	"A lot of guys hit balls right at guys. It's just how it is with this game," Jones said. "There will be days when we bloop them and they all find a home, but tonight, nothing. Crickets out there."	McGowan had a lot to do with it.	"You tip your cap," Jones said. "They pitched a good game."	Game notes	 Baltimore SS J.J. Hardy missed a fifth consecutive game with back spasms but expects to return Saturday. He received a cortisone shot Thursday and practiced Friday. ... Right-hander Bud Norris returns from a six-day layoff to start for Baltimore on Saturday against Toronto RHP Drew Hutchison. ... Ravens CB Lardarius Webb threw out the ceremonial first pitch. ... Toronto SS Jose Reyes (hamstring) participated in running drills prior to the game. He's expected to run the bases Saturday and then could "head out in the next few days" for a rehab assignment, according to Gibbons. ... Bautista has reached base in all 11 games (13 walks, seven hits). ... Orioles 3B Manny Machado (knee) will get two at-bats in a simulated game Saturday but will not run the bases. ... Toronto leadoff hitter Melky Cabrera singled in the eighth to extend his hitting streak to 11 games. ... Orioles LHP Brian Matusz was absent with an illness and did not show up at the ballpark.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

NEW YORK -- Grady Sizemore's big hit against an old friend ensured Jon Lester finally had something to show for an impressive effort.	Sizemore hit a three-run homer in the sixth inning off CC Sabathia and the Boston Red Sox gave Lester enough run support for his first win of the year, 4-2 over the New York Yankees on Friday night.	"Good to have a rally there in that inning," Sizemore said. "We've kind of struggled with Jon on the mound. It's nice to pick him up and get some runs for him."	It wasn't all positive news for Boston in its first win this season over the rival Yankees. Closer Koji Uehara was held out of the game because he had some right shoulder stiffness when throwing during pregame warmups. Manager John Farrell used Edward Mujica in the ninth instead of the 39-year Uehara as a precaution.	"We felt it was best to stay away from him," Farrell said. "It'll be a day-to-day thing."	Jonny Gomes led off the sixth with another long ball off Sabathia, and the four-run inning was more runs than Boston had scored for Lester in his first two starts combined (one). Despite a 2.51 ERA coming in, Lester was at risk of falling to 0-3 for the first time in his big league career.	The left-hander was lifted with two outs in the seventh after Kelly Johnson singled to pull the Yankees within two runs, his first hit in 15 career at-bats against Lester (1-2). Junichi Tazawa relieved with runners at the corners and retired Derek Jeter on a flyout.	Jeter hit leadoff for the Yankees for first time since breaking his left ankle in the 2012 AL championship series opener. He beat out an infield single in four at-bats.	Lester allowed Alfonso Soriano's homer starting the second and six hits overall. He walked two and struck out six in improving to 12-5 in 27 starts against New York.	"I don't feel like I threw the ball as well the first two, but sometimes you need games like this to appreciate the ones where you glide through," Lester said. "This was a little bit of a grinder."	Tazawa pitched 1 1/3 innings of one-hit relief, and Mujica was perfect in the ninth for his first save with Boston.	"I'm ready to go whatever the situation," said Mujica, who had 37 saves for St. Louis and made the NL All-Star team last year before losing his closer's job in September.	Sabathia (1-2) pitched without the controversy that surrounded teammate Michael Pineda in a series-opening 4-1 win Thursday but also without the success. Pineda gave up one run and four hits in six-plus innings but was caught on camera with a brown substance on his hand. Joe Torre, Major League Baseball's executive vice president for baseball operations, said in a statement Friday that Pineda will not be suspended.	Looking as if he was setting aside talk of being an ace on the decline, Sabathia was dominant for five innings. He allowed just David Ross' third-inning double until Gomes led off the sixth with his first homer of the year, on an 89 mph four-seam fastball.	Four batters later, Sizemore crushed an 80 mph slider into right field for a 4-1 lead.	The duo were teammates in Cleveland before Sabathia was traded to Milwaukee during the 2008 season.	"You go out and compete, even against friends," Sabathia said. "Tonight he got the best of me."	Sabathia's fastball velocity has declined from 94.1 mph in 2009, his first season in New York, to 89.7 mph this year entering Friday. Last year he gave up 45 of his major league-leading 122 runs on a career-high 28 homers allowed. He's already yielded five this season.	Sabathia allowed four runs and six hits in seven innings, striking out nine and walking two. He's given up at least four runs in each of his three starts and has a 6.63 ERA.	"I was a little bit better," Sabathia said. "I haven't really been able to put a whole game together."	Game notes	Former Red Sox Jacoby Ellsbury and Matt Thornton were given their World Series rings in a meeting with Boston GM Ben Cherington and Farrell before the game. ... Yankees manager Joe Girardi said 1B Mark Teixeira (right hamstring) should be off the disabled list before May 1 but SS Brendan Ryan (back) is doubtful for the beginning of next month. ... Red Sox OF Shane Victorino took BP and did some light running. Farrell says he'll have an idea about a rehab assignment for Victorino after the White Sox series early next week. ... Next up: Boston's John Lackey (2-0) faces New York's Hiroki Kuroda (1-1).	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PHILADELPHIA --  Marlon Byrd and the Phillies knew facing Jose Fernandez would be a challenge. They were up for it.	Byrd drove in two runs and Philadelphia knocked around Fernandez in one of his worst major league starts, beating the Miami Marlins 6-3 Friday night to snap a four-game skid.	"Offense was very good; they stepped up to the challenge," Phillies manager Ryne Sandberg said. "We wanted to be aggressive early on in the game with strikes in the zone. You don't want to get in the hole too often with him. Guys swung the bats early and that set the tone."	Phillies starter A.J. Burnett left in the fourth inning because of a sore right groin, but Philadelphia chased Fernandez (2-1) with three runs in the fifth en route to its first home win of the season.	"He has that aggressive attitude and a lot of confidence on the mound, but you have to come out swinging," Byrd said. "We got him today. It was huge. We had a good approach, took good swings, put the bats on the ball and got those timely hits."	Fernandez, last season's NL Rookie of the Year, was tagged for eight hits and a career-worst six earned runs in four-plus innings. The right-hander walked four, matching a career high, and struck out six. He gave up only one run over 18 innings in three appearances against Philadelphia last season.	"I was trying to throw strikes and it didn't happen," Fernandez said. "It's all part of the game. I had two good starts and then come here and get my (butt) kicked. I'm looking forward to my next bullpen, then go from there."	Derek Dietrich homered for the Marlins, who lost their fifth straight. Miami has been outscored 32-13 during the slide.	"We had opportunities," manager Mike Redmond said. "We had guys on base but couldn't get anything going."	Burnett was removed with one out in the fourth after walking Casey McGehee to load the bases on four pitches that weren't even close. Phillies trainer Scott Sheridan went to the mound with Sandberg to pull Burnett from the game. He had thrown 106 pitches.	The right-hander will be re-evaluated Saturday.	"I felt like everything was tight. I'm not too concerned, but you never know," the 37-year-old Burnett said. "I'm not a spring chicken anymore."	Left-hander Jake Diekman (1-0) relieved Burnett and wiggled out of a bases-loaded, one-out jam by striking out Jarrod Saltalamacchia and Dietrich.	Byrd had two hits, including a double. Chase Utley and Jimmy Rollins also had two hits for the Phillies, outscored 25-10 by Milwaukee this week in their first home series of the season. The Brewers won all three games for their first sweep in Philadelphia.	Jonathan Papelbon pitched a scoreless ninth for his second save in three chances.	Philadelphia quickly jumped on Fernandez, scoring two runs in the first thanks to Byrd's RBI double and Domonic Brown's RBI single. Byrd has six hits and seven RBIs in his last four games.	After the Marlins tied it at 2 in the second on Dietrich's drive to right-center, Philadelphia went ahead 3-2 in the third thanks to Fernandez's wildness. The Phillies loaded the bases with a pair of walks and Utley's single before Fernandez walked in the go-ahead run with a free pass to Ryan Howard.	Then the hard-throwing righty returned to form by striking out the next three batters, featuring a fastball that reached 98 mph. He whiffed all three in the fourth for six straight strikeouts -- all swinging.	Fernandez, however, was shaky in the fifth when Philadelphia opened the inning with four straight hits, the last of which was Byrd's RBI single that ended Fernandez's night. Kevin Slowey limited the Phillies to just one more run, charged to Fernandez, but the damage had been done.	Jeff Baker's eighth-inning sacrifice fly pulled Miami to 6-3.	Game notes	 Rollins had two walks to give him 694 for his career, moving into sixth place in Phillies history. ... The Marlins have lost 11 of their last 14 in Philadelphia. ... Philadelphia CF Ben Revere (sore ribs) was replaced in the starting lineup by Tony Gwynn Jr. ... The Phillies activated infielder Freddy Galvis from the 15-day disabled list and optioned infielder Cesar Hernandez to Double-A Reading. Galvis, who entered in the sixth, went 0 for 1 with a walk. ... RHP Seth Rosin, a Rule 5 draft pick in December, cleared waivers and was returned to the Phillies. He will report to Triple-A Lehigh Valley. Rosin was selected by the Mets in the offseason and was on the Dodgers and Rangers this year before getting released by Texas on Wednesday. ... Marlins RHP Nathan Eovaldi (1-1, 3.46 ERA) faces Phillies RHP Jonathan Pettibone, who will be making his season debut, on Saturday night.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

CINCINNATI -- David Price wished he had one pitch back.	The left-hander took a shutout into the ninth inning Friday night before giving up a homer to Joey Votto, and the Tampa Bay Rays wound up holding on for a 2-1 victory over the Reds, their first in Cincinnati.	The teams have a brief and lopsided interleague history. The Reds had won eight of their nine previous games, with Tampa Bay's only win coming at Tropicana Field on June 28, 2011, on Evan Longoria's game-ending homer.	This one had all the drama at the end.	"Never had a doubt," Price said.	Longoria singled home a run in the first inning and Matt Joyce connected in the third against Johnny Cueto (0-2) as the Rays finally got a victory in their second visit to Great American Ball Park. They also visited in 2005 and got swept while giving up 34 runs in three games.	Price (2-0) allowed four hits and one walk, losing his shutout when Votto hit an opposite-field drive with one out. He left a pitch over the outside part of the plate, costing him a chance at his third career shutout.	"That stinks," said Price, who threw 114 pitches. "I definitely wanted to finish that game."	Grant Balfour relieved, got Ryan Ludwick on a called third strike, then walked the next two batters and threw a wild pitch that let them advance to second and third. He pitched around Devin Mesoraco, who has been hitting well since his return from the disabled list, and got pinch-hitter Brayan Pena to take a called third strike.	"He (Mesoraco) is hot right now and I'm going to be smart," said Balfour, who is 3 for 3 in save chances. "I played the odds and rolled the dice there."	Despite the teams' limited history, they have one close connection. First-year Reds manager Bryan Price pitched for Joe Maddon when the Rays manager ran the Double-A Midland Angels in the 1980s. Price joked before the game that they got to know each other during Maddon's trips to the mound in the third and fourth innings to replace him.	No early exits in this one. Both starters hung in there against struggling offenses. Tampa Bay has scored a total of eight runs in its last five games. The Reds have scored only 28 runs overall, the second-fewest in the National League.	Both were wasteful again.	Cueto needed 26 pitches to get through the first inning, when he walked two with only one out. Longoria singled home a run, but that's all the Rays could manage. Joyce led off the third inning with a homer that landed way up in the right-field seats for his team-high second of the season.	"In the first inning, I didn't feel like I was ready," Cueto said. "I felt slow. I was a little down on myself. After that, everything clicked in and I was all right."	Tampa Bay had chances for a lot more. The Rays stranded four runners in scoring position in the first five innings against Cueto, who gave up five hits and walked four over seven innings.	The Reds wasted leadoff doubles by Mesoraco in the third and Brandon Phillips in the fourth. Phillips had two of Cincinnati's hits off Price.	Game notes	RH Alex Cobb makes his first career appearance against the Reds on Saturday. RH Alfredo Simon makes his second start for Cincinnati, filling in while Mat Latos recovers from knee surgery. ... The Rays recalled OF Kevin Kiermaier from Triple-A Durham. ... Tampa Bay LH Cesar Ramos will start Sunday in place of LH Matt Moore, on the DL with a sore pitching elbow. ... Maddon invited 1978 NL MVP Dave Parker to meet the Rays before the game. Parker grew up in Cincinnati and coached with Maddon on the Angels' staff. ... Bryan Price lost a replay challenge in the ninth, when he thought Phillips' foot had been hit by a pitch. He lost the challenge: The ball bounced and deflected off the catcher's mitt before hitting the foot.	---	Follow Joe Kay on Twitter: http://twitter.com/apjoekay	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

Nationals 6, Braves 7.
ATLANTA -- Fredi Gonzalez's bench already was thin when he used Jordan Schafer as a pinch runner with two outs in the 10th inning.	The decision to utilize Schafer's speed made the difference.	Schafer scored from first base on Justin Upton's bloop single to right field, giving the Atlanta Braves a 7-6 win over the Washington Nationals on Friday night.	"At the end of the day, you've got to use all the bullets you can," said Gonzalez, the Atlanta manager.	Chris Johnson singled with two outs off left-hander Jerry Blevins (1-1), and Schafer pinch ran. With a 2-2 count, Schafer ran on the pitch and Upton dropped a single in front of Bryce Harper.	Schafer already was rounding third when Harper bobbled the ball. No error was charged.	"I've seen Schafer run before," Upton said. "He had a chance after the ball got down and got away from him a little bit. That's why we had speed at first base."	Blevins threw to first base, trying to keep Schafer close, before Upton's hit.	"They put him in the game to steal second base right there," Nationals manager Matt Williams said. "Otherwise they wouldn't want to lose Johnson. We just want to try to prevent that as much as possible."	Luis Avilan (2-1) pitched around two walks, one intentional, in the 10th.	Upton hit a solo home run in the eighth off Tyler Clippard that tied the score at 6-all, his third homer in two games. Gonzalez said Upton had "about as pretty a swing as you're going to see" on the homer to center.	Atlanta's Ramiro Pena and Washington's Ryan Zimmerman hit three-run drives -- Zimmerman following a throwing error by Dan Uggla on a routine grounder to second.	Upton, who had three hits, is hitting .324. He has 10 hits in his past 21 at-bats.	Denard Span's single off David Carpenter drove in Harper in the eighth to put the Nationals ahead 6-5.	Atlanta burst ahead with a four-run second against Tanner Roark, who allowed five runs and five hits in 4 2/3 innings. He hadn't pitched since a win over the Mets on April 4.	Roark, who hit three batters with pitches, said he wasn't affected by the unusually long layoff.	"No, I felt great out there," Roark said. "I just didn't really have the command of my pitches that I wanted."	Julio Teheran couldn't hold the lead, giving up five runs -- two earned -- and 10 hits in six innings. Ian Desmond had a run-scoring single in the fourth, when the Nationals left the bases loaded.	Williams used his appeal in the seventh inning when Adam LaRoche was called out at the plate when trying to score on Jordan Walden's wild pitch with Harper batting. The pitch bounced away from catcher Evan Gattis toward the Nationals' dugout. Gattis finally spotted the ball and threw to Walden, who made the tag. Plate umpire Adrian Johnson's call was confirmed in the video review.	Braves closer Craig Kimbrel struck out Jayson Werth, LaRoche and Zimmerman in the ninth. Washington's Drew Storen fanned Pena, Ryan Doumit and Jason Heyward in the bottom of the inning.	Pena made his second straight start for shortstop Andrelton Simmons, who jammed his right wrist in a home-plate collision Wednesday night.	"I don't want something small to become something big," Gonzalez said.	If the game had continued to the 11th, Simmons would have entered at shortstop with Pena moving to third base.	Game notes	Williams said Werth left the game with "a little bit of tightness" in his groin before the bottom of the 10th. Werth will be evaluated Saturday. ... Nationals RHP Doug Fister (DL, back muscle) threw 35 pitches in the bullpen before the game. "He was really impressive," Williams said. "The ball had good life." Williams said Fister will go on a minor league injury rehabilitation assignment after he increases his pitch count in bullpen sessions. ... Roark hit Freeman, Uggla and Upton with pitches. ... Simmons was presented his 2013 Gold Glove and Platinum Glove Awards by Rawlings in a pregame ceremony. ... The 10 hits allowed matched Teheran's career high, also against the Nationals on April 29 last year. ... Braves LHP Alex Wood is to face Nationals RHP Taylor Jordan in the second game of the series Saturday night.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- There's a pattern when Yu Darvish pitches against the Astros.	Darvish took a perfect-game bid into the sixth inning, and the Texas Rangers finally finished off the Astros 1-0 on Robinson Chirinos' RBI single in the 12th inning Friday night.	Darvish retired his first 15 batters before Matt Dominguez singled softly to center, one pitch after Alex Rios nearly caught Dominguez's foul into the right-field corner before running into the padded wall as the ball landed.	Darvish came within one out of a perfect game in Houston on April 2 last year, when Marwin Gonzalez grounded a single between the pitcher's legs. He held the Astros hitless in Houston last Aug. 12 before Carlos Corporan's one-out homer in the eighth.	"It's sheer luck," Darvish said through an interpreter. "But if I could pitch like this in every game, it would be very nice."	Darvish allowed just the one hit and one walk in eight innings with nine strikeouts. He fanned five consecutive batters in the third and fourth innings, all swinging. Darvish said he didn't realize he was pitching a no-hitter.	"I was only focused on not giving up runs, so it really didn't matter to me," he said.	Darvish pitched despite bleeding from the knuckle of his right thumb in the middle innings. He said that happened to him multiple times when he pitched in Japan and has never affected his control.	"When he left the game," Astros manager Bo Porter said, "we just thought, 'Let's take our shot at somebody else.'"	But the Texas bullpen limited Houston one more hit and two walks, completing a two-hitter.	Darvish hasn't allowed a run in 15 innings through two starts. Rangers manager Ron Washington said he sees a crisper Darvish than the one who led the major leagues in strikeouts last season.	"In a way, he's just saying he can do anything that he wants to do with that baseball," Washington said.	Former President George W. Bush -- a former Rangers owner -- watched with Hall of Fame pitcher Nolan Ryan, who quit as Texas' controlling owner last October and became executive adviser of the Astros.	Texas was 0-for-14 with runners in scoring position and had stranded 15 runners before Chirinos' hit off Brad Peacock (0-1). The Rangers loaded the bases with no outs in the 10th.	"I don't get frustrated," Texas manager Ron Washington said. "When you get frustrated, you're blind to what's going on."	Kevin Kouzmanoff singled with one out, advanced on a wild pitch and scored on Chirinos' hit to center, ending the game after 4 hours, 11 minutes. Texas left the field with its third straight walkoff win at home.	Jason Frasor (1-0) worked a hitless inning for the victory.	Astros starter Scott Feldman, pitching two days after his 70-year-old father died, allowed two hits in seven innings.	"I knew without a doubt he would want me to pitch," said Feldman, a former Ranger pitching for the first time as a visitor in Arlington. "I had to go out and keep my emotions in check. I think he was watching. He was a big baseball fan. I knew he would want me to do a good job."	Game notes	Rangers RHP Colby Lewis, who hasn't pitched since July 2012 because of arm and hip injuries, is scheduled to start early next week. ... Astros RHP Matt Albers returned from paternity leave Friday. His wife, Tara, delivered their first child, Mason James. ... The Rangers returned RHP Seth Rosin to the Philadelphia Phillies, who assigned him to Triple-A Lehigh Valley. Rosin (1-0) was taken by the New York Mets in the winter meeting draft, traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers and traded to Texas on March 26.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO -- This time, Chris Sale had to rely on Chicago's lineup to get the win.	Conor Gillaspie had a career-high four RBIs, leading Sale and the White Sox to a 9-6 victory over the Cleveland Indians on Friday.	Sale (3-0) pitched five innings in his first win against Cleveland since May 1, 2012. The All-Star left-hander allowed three runs and six hits while throwing 105 pitches.	Sale went 11-14 last year despite a 3.07 ERA. He also had four complete games, tying Tampa Bay star David Price for the AL lead.	But he got a boost from his offense in his third start of this season. Leadoff hitter Adam Eaton had two hits and scored three times as the White Sox picked up their ace on a sluggish night.	Chicago has scored 37 runs in its five home games this year.	"I think if we keep doing what we've been doing and making strides in the right direction we can be a force, be a great team," Sale said. "It's fun to watch, I got to watch a lot of it tonight unfortunately."	The White Sox have captured the first two games of their first series of the year against the Indians, who had a 17-2 record against Chicago last season. They play again on Saturday and Sunday.	Indians starter Carlos Carrasco (0-2) was tagged for five runs and six hits in 4 2/3 innings. It was another shaky start for the right-hander, who allowed five runs in 5 2/3 innings of a 7-3 loss to Minnesota in his season debut.	Cleveland pitching issued nine walks, including walking in two runs.	Gillaspie hit a sacrifice fly in Chicago's two-run third inning, helping the White Sox build a 3-0 lead. Adam Dunn, who had two hits and walked twice, singled and scored on Alejandro De Aza's base hit in the fourth.	Sale, who went 0-4 with an 8.61 ERA in four starts against Cleveland in 2013, was unable to protect the lead. Asdrubal Cabrera had a two-run double in the fifth, and then scored the tying run on Nick Swisher's single.	But Cleveland's pitching struggled throughout the game.	"When you score and tie it up, you gotta go back out and take charge of the game," Indians manager Terry Francona said. "They just kept scoring every inning."	The White Sox averaged 3.19 runs a game in Sale's starts last season.	"These guys are always tough on him," White Sox manager Robin Ventura said. "They were tough on him last (year) and for whatever reason they can foul off a lot of pitches. They probably see something off of him. I don't know what it is. You don't see that many teams foul that much off. He got up there with a high pitch count."	The White Sox grabbed the lead for good in the fifth.	Gillaspie singled in Eaton, and Carrasco was lifted for Marc Rzepczynski after striking out Jose Abreu for the second out of the inning. Rzepczynski walked Dunn to load the bases and then walked in a run as Dayan Viciedo came back from an 0-2 count to give the White Sox a 5-3 lead.	"I thought Carlos in the fifth kind of slowed down his tempo, you could tell he was fighting some of his mechanics," Francona said. "That's when we went to Zep and tried to snuff that out. Nothing, we couldn't put up a zero the rest of the way."	Gillaspie committed an error in the sixth, allowing Michael Brantley to score, but he responded with a two-out, two-run double in the bottom half, making it 7-4.

MILWAUKEE -- Aramis Ramirez crushed a 1-2 fastball into the left-field stands, the breakthrough that the Milwaukee Brewers needed against a tough left-hander.	Once again, the third baseman delivered in a big spot.	Ramirez kept up his torrid hitting with a two-run homer to help back Wily Peralta's solid start, and the Brewers extended their winning streak to seven with a 4-2 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Friday night.	At 8-2, the Brewers are off to their best start since opening with 13 wins in 1987.	"Everything's clicking. We'll continue to grind this thing out as best as we can, but we're doing a lot of good things," manager Ron Roenicke said.	Ramirez's clutch hitting is at the top of the list. His 421-foot homer with two outs in the fourth gave the Brewers a 2-0 lead against Francisco Liriano, who had befuddled the Brewers with his slider.	Ramirez is hitting .727 (8 for 11) with runners in scoring position through the season's first 10 games.	"I would say that's part of job -- I'm a cleanup hitter driving in runs, so I have to concentrate a little harder when I have guys in scoring position," Ramirez said.	Milwaukee missed his bat for stretches of the 2013 season, when he was bothered by a left knee injury. Now, the Brewers have their cleanup hitter back, along with No. 3 hitter Ryan Braun, who returned from a 65-game suspension that following baseball's investigation of a Florida anti-aging clinic.	The Brewers added two more runs in the fifth on a solo shot by Mark Reynolds and a two-out single from Carlos Gomez.	"You can't make too many mistakes in the big leagues. I was trying to go up and in and it went middle-in," Liriano said. "I made two mistakes and you can't make those kinds of mistakes at this level."	Liriano (0-2) struck out seven over six innings. Peralta (1-0) allowed four hits in seven innings, but gave up a two-run homer to Neil Walker in the seventh.	Francisco Rodriguez struck out the side in the ninth for his third save.	Milwaukee has been an early-season surprise after sweeping through three-game sets at Boston and Philadelphia with a .320 batting average. The formula of solid hitting and excellent starting pitching carried over into Friday after Peralta struck out four and got help from Reynolds with two nice plays at first on hard-hit shots.	Pittsburgh didn't get a runner past second base until Walker homered in the seventh. Andrew McCutchen had reached second twice on two-out steals, but Peralta retired cleanup hitter Pedro Alvarez each time to end the inning, including a strikeout on a slider in the sixth.	McCutchen was lifted following his eighth-inning at-bat after telling manager Clint Hurdle he may have hurt an ankle. The 2013 NL MVP appeared to be walking around in the clubhouse afterward without a limp.	"I had the trainer look at him and didn't think it was worth having him try to press on from there," Hurdle said.	Milwaukee entered with a major league-leading 1.95 ERA, an impressive mark given that the team has played three games each in Fenway Park and Citizens Bank Park. Brewers starters were at 2.44, with the bullpen at a minuscule major league-best 0.98.	That mark only improved after relievers Jim Henderson and Rodriguez shut down the Pirates in order during the final two innings.	Liriano dominated early, keeping hitters off balance with his slider. He breezed through the first three innings with five strikeouts on 32 pitches.	Game notes	The Pirates entered having started the season by winning three straight series for the first time since 1992. ... Pittsburgh is in the middle of a stretch in which it is starting the season with 26 straight games against NL Central foes. ... LHP Jeff Locke was reinstated from the 15-day DL and optioned to Triple-A Indianapolis. Locke is recovering from a right oblique strain. ... CF Gomez is to be presented with his 2013 Gold Glove award in a ceremony before Saturday's game. ... The Brewers' Yovani Gallardo (2-0) faces the Pirates' Edinson Volquez (0-0) on the mound Saturday night.	---	Follow Genaro Armas at http://twitter.com/GArmasAP	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MINNEAPOLIS --  The Minnesota Twins needed a strong outing from a starter and Kyle Gibson delivered.	Gibson pitched into the seventh inning, Chris Colabello drove in three runs and Minnesota beat the Kansas City Royals 10-1 Friday night to end a nine-game home losing streak that dated to last season.	Josmil Pinto homered for the Twins, who reached double digits in runs for the third time this year.	"Gibby gave us the performance we needed and then our offense came through," acting manager Terry Steinbach said.	Twins skipper Ron Gardenhire was away from the team and also is expected to miss Saturday's game to attend the funeral for Michael Hirschbeck in Ohio. Hirschbeck, the son of umpire John Hirschbeck, died Tuesday at age 27. He had battled adrenoleukodystrophy, a disease that affects the brain and nervous system.	Mike Moustakas had two hits for Kansas City, which had won seven straight at Target Field.	"Five hits is all we could muster all night long," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "It started out good for us, got a run in the first inning and you're thinking, OK, we can add on to that. But never quite could."	A 4-6 start to the season for Minnesota has been largely due to ineffective starting pitching. The Twins had received just two outings of six or more innings entering the game -- only one quality start -- and the other four starters besides Gibson have a combined 7.50 ERA.	"We've got a lot of good starting pitching," Gibson said. "I don't think it's anything to worry about. Every starter goes out there in their mind to go deep, and just about every start each starter has been a couple pitches away."	After a shaky first inning when he threw 28 pitches and gave up a run, Gibson (2-0) settled down and retired 14 of the next 18 batters. In 6 1/3 innings, he allowed five hits and one earned run while striking out three, lowering his ERA to 1.59.	It was the second straight strong outing for the right-hander, who won the fifth starter's spot in spring training. He made his season debut last Saturday against Cleveland, giving up one run and three hits over five-plus innings.	"The only thing I can control each start is make sure I'm being aggressive," Gibson said.	Kansas City starter Bruce Chen also was coming off a strong first performance, having allowed one earned run in six-plus innings against the White Sox last Saturday.	However, against a patient Twins lineup that worked many deep counts, the soft-throwing left-hander allowed seven hits and six earned runs in 3 2/3 innings. He struck out three and walked two, but only 48 of his 87 pitches were strikes. It was just the second time in nine games the Royals did not get a quality start.	"I wasn't pounding the strike zone like I usually do. I wasn't commanding my pitches as well as I wanted to and it ended up costing me," Chen said.	Minnesota scored five times in the fourth against Chen (0-1) and reliever Louis Coleman.	With the Twins up 2-1, Pinto led off with a home run to the second deck in left field. Minnesota put two more runners on before Joe Mauer got his first RBI of the season with a two-out single to right field, chasing Chen.	With the bases loaded, Coleman threw his second wild pitch in as many batters, allowing a run to score, before Colabello lined a two-run double down the left field line for a 7-1 lead.	"When you get two-out hits, drive in some runs, it's a real dagger to the other team," Colabello said.	The first two Kansas City batters reached in the seventh before Gibson struck out Alcides Escobar. Brian Duensing got the final two outs of the inning.	Kurt Suzuki had a two-run double in the bottom half to make it 9-1.	Game notes	 Minnesota scored 10 or more runs six times last year. ... The Twins expect to put LF Josh Willingham on the 15-day disabled list Saturday. He has been out since he was hit in the left wrist by a pitch Sunday. ... Kansas City 2B Omar Infante returned after missing two games. He sprained his jaw and needed six stitches to close a cut after getting hit in the face by a pitch Monday. ... It was Minnesota's first night game of the year. ... Royals RHP Michael Mariot made his major league debut. He struck out Mauer. ... Starting with this one, Kansas City plays 13 of 16 games on the road. ... RHP James Shields (0-1, 2.70 ERA) is scheduled to pitch Saturday for the Royals against Minnesota RHP Ricky Nolasco (0-1, 9.00).	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ST. LOUIS --  Chicago Cubs closer Jose Veras stumbled first. Then it was Trevor Rosenthal's turn to fail -- at the plate and on the mound.	Welington Castillo hit a three-run homer in the 11th inning off the St. Louis closer, who struck out with an unusual chance to win it, and the Cubs beat the Cardinals 6-3 on Friday night.	"I know he throws really hard," Castillo said. "So I just waited for something over the plate that I can drive, and I put my best wood on it."	The Cardinals tied it with two runs in the ninth and had runners on first and second with two outs in the 10th when manager Mike Matheny decided against a pinch hitter. Rosenthal (0-1) took a called third strike in his second career at-bat and said he didn't carry any disappointment back to the mound.	"Uh no, because I mean, I'm not here to hit," Rosenthal said. "So it's easy to kind of brush it off and just go out there and try to have another shutdown inning."	Nate Schierholtz doubled for his fourth straight hit leading off the 11th and advanced on a sacrifice. Starlin Castro was intentionally walked and Ryan Kalish popped out on a bunt attempt before Castillo lined a 1-1 fastball 426 feet to left for his second homer.	"I figured he might be hunting for a fastball," Rosenthal said. "Looking at the video, I didn't get it up quite as much as I'd hoped, but he put a good swing on a good pitch.	"Not much you can do about it."	Justin Grimm (1-0) walked Matt Holliday and Matt Adams on eight pitches to start the 10th but got out of it, partly because Matheny left Pete Kozma and Tony Cruz on the bench. Grimm struck out Yadier Molina and got Shane Robinson to fly out before facing Rosenthal.	Matheny said he'd have batted Kozma with less than two outs. He also banked on another shutdown inning from Rosenthal, who needed just six pitches in the 10th.	"You've got a real good feeling he's going to bring us back in with another zero," Matheny said. "We had two shots at getting the guy in from second."	Hector Rondon finished for his first career save.	Veras hit two batters and walked another in the ninth. One run scored on a passed ball by Castillo, helping the Cardinals score twice in the inning. Matt Carpenter's bases-loaded sacrifice fly tied it at 3.	Veras has blown both his save chances and has allowed five earned runs in 3 2/3 innings with three hit batters and seven walks.	"A shaky outing," Cubs manager Rick Renteria said, "but he's still our guy."	Chicago starter Jeff Samardzija worked seven economic innings for the third straight start, exiting with a 1.29 ERA. He finally got some runs to work with, but was denied a win for the ninth straight outing since Aug. 24 at San Diego.	"You keep pitching and giving your team a chance to win," Samardzija said. "Everyone is trying to do their jobs and sometimes balls find holes, and sometimes they don't."	Ryan Sweeney's RBI single off Carlos Martinez tied it in the seventh and was the Cubs' first run in 21 innings when Samardzija starts. Anthony Rizzo's sacrifice fly off Kevin Siegrist snapped a tie in a two-run eighth.	Cubs pinch hitters were 1 for 18 before the eighth inning when Justin Ruggiano, batting for Samardzija, singled off Martinez, and Mike Olt, batting for Luis Valbuena, singled off Siegrist.	Molina's RBI single in the second was his 10th hit in 18 career at-bats against Samardzija. He had two hits and is batting .455 (25 for 55) with three homers and 17 RBIs against the Cubs the last two seasons.	Cardinals starter Joe Kelly allowed an unearned run in six innings. He faced the minimum through the first five innings with the help of two double-play balls.	Game notes	 The Cubs' appeal of a hit by pitch call on Allen Craig in the ninth was denied. ... Castro got a strange assist at SS in the fourth when he staggered and dropped Holliday's towering popup with a runner on first. The ball rolled directly to second baseman Emilio Bonifacio for a forceout as Kolten Wong slid back into first. ... Adam Wainwright (1-1, 1.29 ERA) faces Carlos Villanueva (1-2, 4.26) on Saturday. ... Kelly has pitched at least five innings in all 31 career starts, the longest streak by a St. Louis starter 25 or younger since 25-year-old Dizzy Dean went 35 in a row in 1935, according to STATS. ... St. Louis SS Jhonny Peralta was hitless in three at-bats before coming out in a double switch and is 2 for 31 (.063) on the season, both home runs.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PHOENIX -- The Los Angeles Dodgers made a big splash in their return to Chase Field.	They beat Arizona 6-0 on Friday night in their first visit to the ballpark since clinching the National League West title there in September and angering the Diamondbacks by celebrating in the ballpark's swimming pool.	One of the ringleaders of the pool assault, Adrian Gonzalez, drove in five runs Friday night to snap out of a slow start that had him batting .189 with four RBIs coming in.	Hyun-Jin Ryu, pitching on an extra day's rest, threw seven dominant innings, allowing two hits, striking out eight and walking one. He retired 18 of his last 19 batters and allowed only a pair of singles by Miguel Montero.	Gonzalez hit a two-run homer off Brandon McCarthy (0-2) in the first inning, doubled in two more in the third and had an RBI single in the eighth. The Dodgers' Hanley Ramirez was 3-for-4 with two doubles, drove in a run and scored three times.	"You don't get very many of these, where you score a few runs, everything goes good with your pitching and there was really no true stress in the game," Los Angeles manager Don Mattingly said. "It was just one of those games that kind of went our way."	Ramirez and Gonzalez, the Nos. 3 and 4 batters, were a combined 6-for-8 with six RBIs and four runs.	"That's what we're there for," Gonzalez said. "That's what we're out here for is to try to get runs for our pitcher."	Gonzalez's homer, on the first pitch he saw, landed in the right-field seats, not too far from the pool.	Jamey Wright pitched two hitless innings to complete the shutout, which took just 2 hours, 26 minutes. The Dodgers had not blanked the Diamondbacks in Arizona since July 27, 2003, according to STATS.	Ryu rebounded from a rough outing a week earlier against San Francisco in which he was tagged for eight runs -- six earned -- in two innings.	He said the difference this time was he kept the ball down in the strike zone.	"Because I got hit around last game," Ryu said through an interpreter, "I was trying a little harder today."	He beat the Diamondbacks for the second time this season. He was the winning pitcher in the Dodgers' 7-5 victory over Arizona in Australia on March 23.	In another example of the Diamondbacks' starting pitching woes, McCarthy allowed six runs and 10 hits in seven innings. His ERA stands at 7.78.	"I haven't really felt like I have thrown terribly this season," he said. "It has just been a few pitches in there that have gone wrong, and they happen to really hurt me. Whether it is a combination of bad luck and bad pitches, it is really getting old."	He retired his first two batters, then Ramirez singled up the middle. That brought up Gonzalez, who had been hitting the ball hard lately with little to show for it. That changed in one swing that made it 2-0.	The Dodgers got two more on Gonzalez's two-run single in the third.	McCarthy settled down after that, retiring 11 in a row before Dee Gordon's one-out single in the seventh.	Yasiel Puig doubled leading off the eighth and scored when Ramirez doubled into the left-field corner. Ramirez came home on Gonzalez's single.	Puig was back in the starting lineup after being sidelined by a sprained left thumb, the result of a headfirst slide into first base against San Francisco last Saturday. He missed two games and struck out on three pitches as a pinch hitter against Detroit on Wednesday.	Game notes	Paul Goldschmidt was 0-for-4 and failed to reach base for the first time in 32 games, ending the fourth-longest streak in Diamondbacks history. ... Arizona manager Kirk Gibson said RH Josh Collmenter would start Tuesday against the New York Mets, with Randall Delgado going to the bullpen. ... The Diamondbacks signed 37-year-old LHP Randy Wolf to a minor league contract. He will pitch for Triple-A Reno. ... Arizona goes with LHP Wade Miley (2-1, 4.05 ERA) on Saturday while the Dodgers start RHP Zack Greinke (2-0, 3.27). ... Mattingly said after the game that RHP Dan Haren will start Sunday.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Hank Conger got his first RBI of the season the hard way. It was the ultimate in taking one for the team.	Conger was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded in the 11th inning after rookie Jeurys Familia intentionally walked the previous two batters, and the Los Angeles Angels got home runs from Mike Trout and J.B. Shuck in a 5-4 victory over the New York Mets on Friday night.	"With bases loaded, your job is to try to somehow get on base so you'll drive in the run. So I was just trying to get a pitch up because I knew a sac fly would do," said Conger, who entered on defense in the ninth after catcher Chris Iannetta was replaced by a pinch runner. "I just went up there trying to battle him."	Raul Ibanez led off the 11th with a single against Familia (0-2), who was working his third inning of relief. Ibanez advanced on a wild pitch and went to third on a grounder to shortstop by David Freese before Mets manager Terry Collins ordered Familia to walk Howie Kendrick and Shuck to set up a force at any base.	"That's part of the game, you know? Sometimes you have to do that -- walk the guy and try to get a double play," Familia said. "So you just try to keep going, pound the zone and try to get ground balls."	The strategy backfired when Familia plunked Conger in the ribs with a 2-2 delivery on his 51st pitch. Conger recoiled to absorb the blow.	The run ended a string of 18 2/3 scoreless innings by Mets relievers after they allowed 13 earned runs in the team's first four games.	Kyle Farnsworth helped keep the streak going when he retired Albert Pujols on a grounder with the bases loaded to end the eighth. Pujols came up again in the 10th with two on and hit a bouncer back to Familia for the third out, leaving the three-time National League MVP with five RBIs in his first 41 at-bats.	Michael Kohn (1-0) pitched a perfect inning for the win.	Travis d'Arnaud homered for the Mets, and Josh Satin hit a two-run double.	This is the Mets' third visit to Anaheim since interleague play began in 1997. Their previous series at the "Big A" was in June 2008, when manager Willie Randolph was fired in the middle of the night and replaced by Jerry Manuel.	New York's 4-2 lead evaporated in the sixth when Dillon Gee gave up a walk to Kendrick and a two-run homer by Shuck that landed in the lower seats in the right-field corner.	It came in the first game of the season for Shuck, recalled from the minors Wednesday when right fielder Josh Hamilton went on the disabled list with a torn ligament in his left thumb. Hamilton, injured on a headfirst slide into first base Tuesday at Seattle, had surgery Friday morning and is expected to be sidelined six to eight weeks.	"It says a lot about J.B. and a lot about the team," Conger said. "Obviously, it had to be kind of a shock for him to get sent down toward the end of spring training. The team knows there's big shoes to fill, as far as Hamilton goes. So he comes up here and plays with a chip on his shoulder, and tonight he did an awesome job."	Gee was charged with four runs and six hits in 5 2/3 innings, the first time in 20 starts that he failed to get through the sixth. He walked the bases loaded in the fifth but escaped when Satin fielded a grounder by Ibanez that hit first base and bounced high in the air.	"It's really frustrating. Today was just not a good outing all the way around," Gee said. "I didn't feel really good and I struggled with command, walking as many guys as I did. So I just tried to battle through it and grind it out. This was one of those days where I had trouble finding the release point I wanted."	The Mets, who traveled cross-country following Thursday night's 6-4 victory in Atlanta, didn't get to their hotel until 3 a.m. But they scored in three of the first four innings against lefty Tyler Skaggs.	"You want to put up zeros, but fortunately the team picked me up," said Skaggs, who went seven innings.	Curtis Granderson caught Shuck's fly ball in the right-field corner for the first out of the eighth, then did an immediate 360 toward the stands after a fan reached out and touched him on the back. Security guards escorted the fan out moments later.	Game notes	Collins piloted the Angels for two-plus seasons and resigned with 29 games left in the 1999 campaign. Mike Scioscia took over the following season. ... The Angels reinstated RHP Dane De La Rosa (strained forearm) from the disabled list and optioned LHP Nick Maronde to Triple-A Salt Lake.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

SEATTLE --  Felix Hernandez walked in from the bullpen and threw his first pitch to a standing ovation after warming up with Aloe Blacc's song "The Man" playing over the stadium speakers.	After 11 strikeouts in seven-plus innings, Seattle's ace left the mound to the same song and same cheers.	"It was a really good song," Hernandez said.	King Felix took a shutout into the eighth inning and was backed by homers from Mike Zunino and Brad Miller as the Mariners held on for a 6-4 win over the Oakland Athletics on Friday night.	Hernandez (3-0) shut down Oakland for the second time in a week, becoming the first Mariners pitcher to win three times in the first nine games of a season.	With the usual "King's Court" for Hernandez home starts expanded to a "Supreme Court" encompassing the entire stadium with yellow shirts and "K" cards, Hernandez gave up four hits in the 28th double-digit strikeout game of his career.	Hernandez was charged with two runs and walked none. He has 30 strikeouts against two walks in his three starts.	"I have to throw good games. There are a lot of people here," Hernandez said. "If you throw a bad game it's not going to be good."	Hernandez has been exceptionally good to start 2014. He's allowed five earned runs in his three starts and 14 total hits. He set down the first 10 Oakland batters Friday before Jed Lowrie's one-out single in the fourth.	Three of Oakland's four hits off Hernandez came in the span of five batters in the fourth and fifth. Josh Donaldson followed Lowrie's hit with an infield single, but Hernandez pitched out of the jam with strikeouts of Brandon Moss and Yoenis Cespedes.	Alberto Callaspo doubled to lead off the fifth and advanced to third on Robinson Cano's two-out error at second base. Hernandez struck out Sam Fuld looking to end the inning.	Hernandez struck out the side in the seventh, but Daric Barton was hit on the foot by a curveball and Eric Sogard singled to open the eighth. That was it for Hernandez.	"I thought his stuff was exceptional tonight," Seattle manager Lloyd McClendon said. "He had a great mix of all his pitches."	What should have been a comfortable win became shaky because of Seattle's bullpen.	Lucas Luetge walked his only batter. Danny Farquhar walked Lowrie on a 3-2 pitch to score Barton. Moss added a broken-bat single off Charlie Furbush for the second run charged to Hernandez, and Cespedes beat out a potential double play to score another. Furbush threw a wild pitch that Fuld scored on to cut the deficit to 6-4, but Callaspo popped out to end the rally.	Fernando Rodney pitched the ninth for his third save.	Seattle had the cushion for a poor night from the bullpen thanks to the homers by Zunino and Miller in the sixth. Zunino's two-run shot ended the night for A's starter Tommy Milone (0-1).	Miller followed two batters later with a solo shot to center field with the wind blowing in.	"Shoot, I think that was all I had. I was just hoping Fuld wasn't going to go up and take that one back in," Miller said.	The Mariners needed only three pitches to get to Milone, who was making his first start of the season after postponements caused his turn to be skipped. Abraham Almonte doubled on the first pitch of the game, Miller followed with a bunt single and Cano's infield hit gave Seattle a 1-0 lead.	Seattle scored twice in the fourth thanks to two-out errors by Donaldson and Lowrie after Dustin Ackley's double kept the inning going.	Milone gave up 10 hits and three earned runs in his season debut.	"I felt like I threw the ball well but it's tough to look at that outing and be happy about it," he said.	Game notes	 Oakland OF Coco Crisp did not start for the fourth straight game due to a sore wrist. He pinch-hit in the ninth. ... The A's will likely activate OF Craig Gentry from the disabled list Saturday, manager Bob Melvin said. ... Ackley became the first Seattle batter with three hits in a game this season. ... Seattle is still unsure of its starter for Tuesday in Texas. McClendon expected a decision before Saturday's game. Likely options are RHP Blake Beavan coming up from Triple-A or RHP Taijuan Walker being activated from the DL.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

SAN DIEGO -- Andrew Cashner is "totally aware" the San Diego Padres have never had a no-hitter in their mostly sad-sack history, which has now reached 46 seasons and 7,176 games.	After throwing his second one-hitter in a span of five starts, the big Texan is the leading candidate to end that drought.	"That's one of my goals. I definitely want a no-hitter," Cashner said after allowing just one single and striking out 11 in a 6-0 victory against the Detroit Tigers on Friday night. "I don't think there's any reason why I can't build off this. When you get late in a game and your pitch count's high, you've really got to bear down and grind through. I think this will build toward something down the road."	Cashner took a no-hitter into the sixth inning before Rajai Davis hit a one-out flare single into center field, just past the glove of outstretched second baseman Jedd Gyorko. Davis stole second and third, and Ian Kinsler walked before Miguel Cabrera, the AL MVP in 2012 and 2013, hit into a double play.	Cashner ended his remarkable outing by striking out Cabrera swinging, on a 95-mph fastball.	On Sept. 16 at Pittsburgh, the right-hander carried a perfect game into the seventh inning and faced the minimum 27 batters in a one-hitter. He retired his first 18 batters before Jose Tabata grounded a clean single into right field leading off the seventh.	Cashner said Friday night's one-hitter meant more.	"Just with the guys in their lineup, it was a lot bigger game. They've got a heck of a team over there. A lot of guys can hit the ball out of the park."	Chase Headley hit a two-run homer and finished with three RBIs.	Cashner (1-1) retired 14 in a row before allowing the single. He walked two.	"I felt as good as I've felt in a while," he said. `'I'm conditioned to run the bases and to be a complete ballplayer."	Manager Bud Black said Cashner was so good because of "tremendous movement with command" of his fastball. That was a well-pitched game. Well-pitched. As good as you're going to see."	Five of his strikeouts were looking, including all three in the third, when he caught pitcher Rick Porcello, Davis and Kinsler looking at strike three.	"He was just beating guys with his velocity. They just couldn't get the head out front," Black said. "But when you have a pitcher hitting the glove for called third strikes, and you see the look on the hitters, and I saw that early on, I knew he had a good feel for his fastball."	Dating to Aug. 19, Cashner has allowed two or fewer earned runs in nine straight starts for an ERA of 0.96.	"He pitched outstanding," said Brad Ausmus, who worked in San Diego's front office before being hired as Detroit's manager in early November. "He's always been a hard thrower. He located extremely well. His slider was extremely effective, his changeup. I know he's not a household name, but I know what h is capable of."	The Padres hit Porcello hard, collecting 10 hits in his 6 1/3 innings. He left after Cashner singled.	The Padres were onto Porcello from the start. Everth Cabrera hit a leadoff single, advanced on two groundouts and scored on Gyorko's triple. The ball hit the heel of right fielder Don Kelly's glove and hit the ground as Kelly slammed headfirst into the wall. After being checked by a trainer, Kelly stayed in the game.	Headley then doubled into the left-center gap to bring in Gyorko.	Headley homered to right on a 2-2 slider from Porcello with one out in the sixth, his first. It was estimated at 385 feet. Seth Smith was aboard on a leadoff double.	Porcello (1-1) allowed five runs and struck out five.	"There were a couple of balls up in the zone that the Padres hitters took advantage of," Ausmus said. "But he kept us in the game. It's really more about the way Cashner pitched more than anything else."	Game notes	Padres CF Cameron Maybin, who ruptured his left biceps tendon making a diving catch in a spring game on March 2, began a rehab assignment with Triple-A El Paso. Manager Bud Black said he'd like Maybin to get more than 20 at-bats during the assignment. "Right now he's restarting his spring training," Black said. "He's in baseball shape. Now we've got to get him in baseball-ready shape." ... Black said pitcher Josh Johnson, who's also on the DL, still has soreness in his forearm. ... Black said LF Carlos Quentin, on the DL with a bone bruise in his left knee, is working in the weight room and hitting in the indoor batting cage. Black said Quentin is getting close to hitting on the field. ... The series continues Saturday night when Tigers RHP Justin Verlander (0-1, 2.57 ERA) is scheduled to face RHP Ian Kennedy (1-1, 3.27). Verlander was one of several top players the Padres could have taken with the first pick in the 2004 amateur draft. Instead, they took local SS Matt Bush, who was a bust. Verlander went to the Tigers with the second overall pick.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Madison Bumgarner just missed clearing the fences his first time up, hitting a sacrifice fly to the warning track in left field.	The pitcher left no doubt the second time he faced Colorado Rockies starter Jorge De La Rosa.	Bumgarner hit a grand slam and drove in a career-high five runs to overcome a shaky outing on the mound, sending the San Francisco Giants to a 6-5 victory Friday night.	Bumgarner hit a sacrifice fly off De La Rosa in the third inning, then connected for a towering home run in the fourth. It was Bumgarner's third career homer and only the second grand slam by a Giants pitcher since the team relocated from New York to San Francisco in 1958.	"They don't really expect a whole lot out of pitchers so we get to go up there with no pressure," Bumgarner said. "It's easier to hit that way, but at the same time it's the hardest thing to do in sports."	Shawn Estes is the only other San Francisco pitcher to hit a grand slam. He did it against Montreal on May 24, 2000, in an 18-0 blowout of the Expos.	Bumgarner's homer came with the Giants trailing 3-1, and his five RBIs wound up being the difference in the game.	"That's quite a night," San Francisco manager Bruce Bochy said. "He wasn't quite as sharp (on the mound) but he found a way to win the game and he did it with his bat. Good for him."	Brandon Crawford added two hits and scored twice for the Giants.	Carlos Gonzalez homered for Colorado, which played short-handed after injuries sidelined two of its top hitters.	"Any time you're facing Bumgarner you know it's going to be a tough at-bat," Gonzalez said. "He threw me a 3-2 curveball and there's no way I'm sitting on it. I just reacted ... but things changed after that."	Bumgarner (2-0) struck out seven and walked two in six erratic innings. He allowed nine hits and appeared headed for a short night until the Giants scored five runs in the fourth.	His home run came on a day when both teams were minus key players.	Troy Tulowitzki's sore quadriceps kept him out of Colorado's starting lineup. He pinch-hit in the ninth and struck out looking against closer Sergio Romo to end the game.	The Rockies also were without catcher Wilin Rosario, who hurt his left wrist while sliding during Wednesday's 8-1 win against the Chicago White Sox.	San Francisco played with a jumbled lineup as Bochy rested catcher Buster Posey and center fielder Angel Pagan.	There were still plenty of offensive fireworks.	Gonzalez hit a two-run shot off Bumgarner in the third to put the Rockies up 3-0. The ball landed in McCovey Cove, the second time Colorado's slugger has reached the waters beyond AT&T Park.	Bumgarner, a right-handed batter, came a few feet shy of homering off De La Rosa (0-2) in the third and hit a sacrifice fly to drive in Crawford, who led off the inning with a triple.	There was no doubt about Bumgarner's drive in the fourth. He sent De La Rosa's first pitch deep into the left field stands for his first home run since 2012.	De La Rosa, Colorado's opening day starter, failed to make it out of the fifth for the third consecutive start. He struck out six and walked two.	"It looked like his command got away from him," Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. "He had his 'A' game early, then it got away from him."	Bumgarner wasn't sharp either and labored most of the game. He threw 112 pitches and gave up four runs, ending a streak of 21 consecutive starts in which he allowed three earned runs or fewer.	Colorado cut it to 6-5 on Charlie Blackmon's pinch-hit single off reliever Santiago Casilla in the eighth but made two baserunning blunders.	Blackmon strayed too far off second and was thrown out after Casilla made a nice play to spear Jordan Pacheco's fielder's choice. Pacheco then got doubled up when San Francisco center fielder Juan Perez caught DJ LeMahieu's flyball and threw to first.	Romo struck out the side in the ninth for his third save.	The Rockies went up 1-0 in the first when leadoff hitter Brandon Barnes singled and later scored from third while Josh Rutledge was caught trying to steal second.	Rutledge started in place of Tulowitzki and went 3 for 4.	Game notes	Gonzalez has five career home runs off Bumgarner, the most given up by the San Francisco lefty. ... LHP Brett Anderson (0-2) pitches Saturday against San Francisco RHP Matt Cain (0-1).	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

NEW YORK -- Brian McCann was far from panic mode. He was hitting the ball well, and figured positive results would follow.	Still, he enjoyed seeing his drives wind up in the seats instead of someone's glove.	McCann put an emphatic end to his season-opening slump, hitting his first two home runs for the New York Yankees to help beat John Lackey and the Boston Red Sox 7-4 Saturday.	"I was pleased about my at-bats today," McCann said.	Carlos Beltran, Alfonso Soriano and Kelly Johnson also connected as the Yankees scored all their runs on homers. Lackey was tagged for a career-high four home runs in 5 2/3 innings.	New York has won two of three in a series that wraps up Sunday night.	A.J. Pierzynski hit his first home run for the Red Sox.	After striking out in the first inning and dropping his batting average to .158, McCann quickly reversed his fortunes. The seven-time All-Star who left Atlanta to sign an $85 million, five-year deal with the Yankees led off the fourth with a liner into the first row of the second deck in right field.	McCann hurried around the bases, and fans were still cheering when Soriano followed with his third home run of the week.	Beltran opened the sixth with a double and McCann homered to right-center. It was the catcher's 10th career multihomer game.	"I've been seeing the ball pretty well to be hitting in the hundreds," McCann said.	As for any concerns about a slow start, he said, "I don't look at it that way."	The Red Sox have been shifting on McCann during this series, moving an extra infielder onto the right side once they get a strike on him. Facing Lackey for the first time, McCann made moot any shift.	"He's hit the ball better than his numbers indicated," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.	"I was not really concerned about it. I know he's going to hit."	Girardi said he assumed the short right-field fence and the jet stream that carries the ball in that direction would benefit the lefty-hitting McCann.	"It showed up today," Girardi said.	Hiroki Kuroda (2-1) pitched into the seventh, and reliever Matt Thornton gave up Mike Carp's two-run single that made it 6-4. With runners at the corners, Carp was caught stealing for the third out.	Shawn Kelley pitched a perfect ninth for his second save.	Lackey (2-1) threw plenty of strikes, but gave up 10 hits. He walked none, fanned six and missed a chance to get off to a 3-0 start for the first time in his career.	Jacoby Ellsbury bunted for a two-out single in the first and Beltran homered on an 0-2 pitch right down the middle. Lackey was already stalking toward the plate to get a new ball from the umpire before Beltran reached second base.	"I just left it over the plate. It wasn't a very good pitch, up in the zone. One of those I'd like to have back, for sure," Lackey said.	Johnson hit his third homer in the eighth.	Game notes	Soriano had played only one inning in right field during his career -- in the 2003 World Series, in fact -- before starting there in this game. He made an error on the first chance he got, dropping a soft fly by Xander Bogaerts. ... David Ortiz has reached safely in 25 straight games against the Yankees, the longest active streak vs. New York. He got one hit, and is 11 for 20 lifetime facing Kuroda. ... The Yankees hit back-to-back homers for the first time since last June 6. ... Red Sox CF Grady Sizemore didn't start, a day after his big three-run homer beat the Yankees. He missed the last two seasons because of injuries, and manager John Farrell doesn't want to overuse him. ... Yankees SS Derek Jeter got a day off. ... Yankees 1B Mark Teixeira (strained right hamstring) said his recovery is going well. He's eligible to come off the DL next weekend and Girardi said he'd be surprised if Teixeira isn't back on time. ... Red Sox LHP Felix Doubront (1-1, 9.00 ERA) is set to face RHP Ivan Nova (1-1, 8.68) in the series finale.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CINCINNATI -- The starter throws seven shutout innings. The defense makes a few big plays. One swing of the bat provides all the offense needed.	Not a very flashy way to win, but it's working for the Tampa Bay Rays.	Alex Cobb went seven innings on Saturday, extending Tampa Bay's run of solid starting pitching, and James Loney homered for a 1-0 victory over the slumping Cincinnati Reds.	The Rays came into the interleague series with a 1-8 mark against Cincinnati. They've taken the first two games with their simple formula.	"We hit some balls well, they hit some balls well, their defense played great also," Rays manager Joe Maddon said. "So just one of those days, man. We hit a homer and we win."	Cobb (1-1) pitched seven shutout inning against Texas on Sunday but got a no-decision. He kept the scoreless streak going Saturday, limiting Cincinnati's struggling lineup to four hits without walking a batter. He's now gone 15 1-3 innings without allowing a run.	Grant Balfour, who fanned Brayan Pena with the bases loaded to end Friday night's game, got three outs for his fourth save in as many chances, finishing off the four-hitter.	Cincinnati stranded a pair at third base and had runners thrown out at third and home, extending its run of wasteful offense.	The Reds have lost all four of their series this season, falling to 3-8 for the first time since 1995, when they won the NL Central. They had a brief team meeting after the game.	"It was just a friendly reminder of what we've got here and who we are as a team," Pena said. "It was a very positive meeting. The skipper (Bryan Price) got involved."	Loney led off the second inning with his first homer against Alfredo Simon (1-1), who matched his career high with eight innings and allowed only five hits.	The Rays opened the series with a 2-1 win Friday night, when David Price took a shutout into the ninth before Joey Votto homered with one out. Rays starters have thrown at least seven shutout innings four times in the last six games.	It was Tampa Bay's second shutout of the season, and the second time the Reds have been shut out. The Reds also were blanked 1-0 by the Cardinals on opening day.	Both managers changed their lineups, looking for some runs.	The Rays have scored only nine in their last six games, but managed to win three of them because of the impressive pitching. The Reds have scored 28 runs all season, second-fewest in the National League.	Maddon stocked his lineup with left-handers against Simon. Price moved Votto from third to second in the batting order, the first time he'd batted second since 2008.	Neither move made much of a difference. Nice defense by both teams also kept it close.	Votto led off the fourth with a ground-rule double. Kevin Kiermaier threw out Votto at the plate as he tried to score on Brandon Phillips' single to center. Phillips went to second on the play and was thrown out trying to steal third.	"Kiermaier's throw today was the play of the game, the play of the season so far," Maddon said. "He's an exceptional outfielder. He's among the best major league outfielders today and he's only played one game here in the regular season."	Kiermaier was optioned back to Triple-A Durham after the game, as expected. His throw home in the fourth was a good way to leave.	"I wanted to come up here and contribute any way I could," said Kiermaier, who was called up Friday and told he'd be in the majors for only a couple of days. "For me to throw Votto out at home, especially in a 1-0 game, just made it that much better. It was a pivotal time in the game."	The Reds wasted another chance in the sixth, when Zack Cozart was hit by a pitch and advanced on a wild pitch and a sacrifice. Billy Hamilton hit a shallow fly and Votto grounded out.	NOTES: LHP Erik Bedard was added to the Rays' roster following the game. ... LHP Cesar Ramos moves from the bullpen to the rotation on Sunday, taking the place of injured Matt Moore. Ramos will make his fourth career start. Reds LHP Tony Cingrani makes his first career appearance against the Rays. ... Reds RHP Mat Latos had an MRI on his pitching forearm. It bothered him during a throwing session the previous day. Latos is trying to recover from surgery to repair torn knee cartilage on Feb. 14.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CHICAGO -- The Cleveland Indians almost wasted a great chance to grab the lead in the seventh inning on Saturday. Then Ryan Raburn came to the plate and did what he usually does against the Chicago White Sox.	Raburn hit a tiebreaking single and David Murphy drove in four runs, leading the Indians to a 12-6 victory over the White Sox.	"It's a team win," Raburn said. "Just to be able to be in that position to help us out, I mean, that's a tribute to our team putting us in that position."	Murphy, Nick Swisher and Jason Kipnis homered for Cleveland, which snapped a three-game losing streak. Murphy added a bases-loaded triple in a four-run ninth against Donnie Veal.	The Indians improved to 18-4 against the White Sox since the beginning of last season, overcoming another shaky start by Justin Masterson. They will try for a split of the four-game series Sunday.	"It was a long day of good at-bats and we needed them," Indians manager Terry Francona said.	Adam Eaton had two hits, including his first homer, and walked twice for the White Sox, who have scored five or more runs in nine of their 12 games this season.	"We're going up there with an approach and trying to execute the approach," Eaton said. "It will come around and we'll be just fine. I love seeing the fight."	Alexei Ramirez's nifty slide past catcher Carlos Santana tied it at 6 in the fifth, but Raburn put the Indians ahead to stay with a two-run single in the seventh.	The Indians loaded the bases with one out against Ronald Belisario (1-1) and Scott Downs. Daniel Webb came in and got Asdrubal Cabrera to foul out, but Raburn followed with a bouncer into center field to make it 8-6.	"They got a chance to wiggle out of that with a tie game at home and Raburn smacks that ball up the middle and gives us the lead," Francona said. "That was huge."	Raburn, who began his career with Detroit, has a .301 batting average, 17 homers and 72 RBIs in 97 career games against Chicago.	"This is one of those places, I feel pretty comfortable up there," he said. "I've faced these guys so many times you kind of get a knack for what they're trying to do, but you've still got to put the bat on the ball."	Raburn's big hit handed a win to Josh Outman, one of four relievers who shut down the White Sox after Masterson labored through 4 2/3 innings. Outman (2-0), Bryan Shaw, Cody Allen and John Axford combined for 4 1/3 innings of one-hit ball.	Masterson was charged with six runs, five earned, and seven hits in his first start since he lasted just 3 2/3 innings against Minnesota last Sunday. The right-hander also walked five to go along with seven strikeouts.	"I was decently happy with the way things took place as far as how I felt when I let go of the ball," Masterson said. "Sometimes after letting go of the ball, the things I can't control, they got me a little bit."	Masterson dominated the White Sox last year, going 4-0 with a sparkling 0.83 ERA in 32 2/3 innings.	Chicago right-hander Felipe Paulino also had a rough start, allowing six runs and six hits in five innings.	"I've been fighting a lot executing my pitches (the) last couple of games," Paulino said. "But I miss a lot of spots. ... My slider comes sometimes, but I'm looking for consistency."	Francona won a replay challenge after Nyjer Morgan was picked off in the first, leading to three runs. The overturned call put Morgan back at first base, and he eventually scored on Michael Brantley's two-run single. Cabrera added a run-scoring groundout.	Eaton's homer gave the White Sox a 5-4 lead in the second. Cleveland went back in front when Swisher and Kipnis connected in the fifth. It was the first set of back-to-back homers for the Indians this season.	Game notes	Indians OF Michael Bourn (strained left hamstring) will play another rehab game with Double-A Akron on Sunday. "I think he's feeling pretty good. I think the last thing is being able to get to that gear and not having to think about it. That'll be when he's ready to go," Francona said. ... Indians RHP Corey Kluber (1-1, 7.71 ERA) and White Sox LHP Jose Quintana (1-0, 2.77) square off in the series finale. ... The Indians are off Monday, and Francona said RHP Carlos Carrasco will work out of the bullpen before making his next start Saturday against Toronto. Carrasco allowed five runs and six hits in 4 2/3 innings during Friday's 9-6 loss to the White Sox.	---	Jay Cohen can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/jcohenap	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

MINNEAPOLIS --  After adding Ricky Nolasco and Phil Hughes in the offseason, the Twins expected their rotation to be better.	Instead, the offense has been the biggest turnaround for Minnesota.	Joe Mauer hit his first home run of the season, Brian Dozier connected for his fourth and Nolasco earned his initial win with the Twins in a 7-1 victory Saturday over the Kansas City Royals.	"I feel like, one through nine, everybody today had at least three hard-hit balls each, and that's a tell-tale sign an offense is clicking," said Dozier, who tied for the AL lead in homers. "Been doing that for the past week now, so everything is starting to click as a team right now."	A day after getting his first RBI of the year, Mauer hit a three-run shot against starter James Shields (0-2). Dozier had a leadoff homer for Minnesota, which has scored the second-most runs in the American League.	Nolasco (1-1) showed why the Twins signed him to a $49 million, four-year contract to steady their rotation.	The right-hander gave up five runs in each of his first two outings for his new team, but was on top of his game Saturday in his first home start for Minnesota. Nolasco went eight innings and allowed five hits with four strikeouts.	"I wish I could say I'm going to go eight every time," Nolasco said. "This level is very difficult and you can never count yourself out no matter how good or bad you're doing. I had two bad starts, but my mentality is still like I could do something like today."	While the rotation was addressed in the offseason, it was Minnesota's lineup that figured to keep the Twins near the bottom of the AL Central again. Instead, Dozier has been a power source in the leadoff spot, and Minnesota has received big production from a middle of the order that includes Trevor Plouffe, Chris Colabello and Jason Kubel.	Making the transition full-time to first base this season, Mauer was slow to come around with the bat. Kansas City's first trip to Minnesota was the perfect remedy, though. In his career, Mauer has hit .338 against the Royals with 11 homers and 95 RBIs. He's also hit .350 (12 for 37) against Shields.	"When it's all said and done his numbers are going to be there," acting Twins manager Terry Steinbach said. "He's a professional hitter, a great hitter, and just over the course of time it's going to happen. It was good to see him connect with one and get that ball out of the ballpark."	Shields put Kansas City in an early hole again. The Royals had seven quality starts in their first eight games, but Bruce Chen allowed two first-inning runs Friday night and only went 3 2/3 innings. Shields gave up a home run to Dozier on his fourth pitch and Minnesota added six runs in the second.	Shields was undone by the defense, including his own.	None of the runs in the second were earned because Shields misplayed a sacrifice bunt by Kurt Suzuki, with the ball slipping out of his hand for an error as the pitcher tried to throw to third base. Shields then walked No. 8 hitter Aaron Hicks with the bases loaded. Later, third baseman Mike Moustakas couldn't handle a hard-hit grounder by Dozier that deflected into left field for an error, allowing two runs to score.	Mauer followed Moustakas' error with a three-run homer, his first since Aug. 16 last season.	"Even though it was a 3-2 count, I was trying to go changeup down and away," Shields said. "He's a pretty good hitter. He's going to hit that every time."	Shields yielded seven runs -- one earned -- in 5 2/3 innings. He gave up six hits and walked three while striking out five.	Game notes	 Steinbach filled in for Twins manager Ron Gardenhire the past two games while Gardenhire attended the funeral for Michael Hirschbeck in Ohio. Hirschbeck, the son of umpire John Hirschbeck, died Tuesday at age 27. Gardenhire is expected back for Sunday's game. ... Kansas City recalled LHP Danny Duffy from Triple-A Omaha to pitch out of the bullpen. Duffy, who was in the mix for a rotation spot this spring, is the only healthy left-hander in the bullpen. The Royals optioned 2B Johnny Giavotella to Omaha. ... Minnesota put LF Josh Willingham on the 15-day disabled list with a bruised left wrist. Willingham was set to have an MRI later Saturday. The move was made retroactive to Monday, and the team hopes he'll be ready to return when eligible. The Twins recalled RHP Michael Tonkin from Triple-A Rochester. ... Minnesota assistant general manager Rob Antony said SS Jason Bartlett will travel to Fort Myers, Fla., on Sunday to begin rehabilitating a left ankle injury. Bartlett was placed on the disabled list Monday. ... Twins RHP Kevin Correia (0-1, 6.17 ERA) pitches Sunday against LHP Jason Vargas (1-0, 1.20).	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

ST. LOUIS -- Adam Wainwright's day started as badly as it could but ended up just fine.	Wainwright gave up Junior Lake's homer on his first pitch and allowed six more hits and three runs after that. But he saved a tired bullpen by sticking around for seven innings Saturday and leading the St. Louis Cardinals to a 10-4 win over the Chicago Cubs.	It was hardly a vintage performance by Wainwright (2-1), who struck out eight and helped his own cause with an RBI single. The four runs were twice as many as he yielded in his first two starts.	"It was OK," said Wainwright, who led the majors with 241 2/3 innings pitched last year. "I think because our offense was so great, I did what they needed me to do, just go a little later in the game and give the bullpen guys some rest."	St. Louis relievers Carlos Martinez, Kevin Siegrist and Trevor Rosenthal all threw more than 20 pitches in Friday night's 11-inning loss.	"We needed that," manager Mike Matheny said about Wainwright's outing. "There were a couple of guys we were wanting to stay away from, for sure."	In hindsight, Wainwright said there were only a few pitches he wanted back -- including his first one.	"He's an aggressive hitter," Wainwright said. "I should have known he was going to be swinging there. That's OK to throw a fastball when you know they're swinging, but you've just got to locate your heater."	The win was Wainwright's 101st with the Cardinals, tying Matt Morris, Larry Jackson and Max Lanier for 10th place on the franchise list.	Matt Adams homered and Matt Carpenter drove in two runs for the Cardinals. Daniel Descalso also had two hits with an RBI and two runs scored.	Adams hit his first home run of the season, a leadoff shot in the second inning, and Jon Jay drove in two runs with a single.	"It was nice to get some runs, especially for Adam and let him do his thing," Matheny said. "We took some good at-bats right from the top."	The Cubs' Nate Schierholtz, who had four hits Friday night, had two doubles and an RBI.	"We did some good things, especially against Wainwright, who is an excellent pitcher," Chicago manager Rick Renteria said. "We just didn't do enough."	St. Louis did most of its damage against starter Carlos Villanueva (1-3), who allowed nine runs and 10 hits in three innings.	"I didn't feel bad," Villanueva said. "I felt like I had good stuff. But they're a good team and they got me out of there quickly."	After Adams' homer tied the game at 1, the Cardinals sent eight more batters to the plate in the second. Yadier Molina and Allen Craig followed with singles, and they came home on RBI singles by Descalso and Wainwright. Carpenter then drove home Descalso with an infield single to shortstop that made it 4-1.	St. Louis sent 10 more hitters to the plate in the fourth inning and broke it open by scoring five times.	Descalso started the inning with a double and was safe at third on Wainwright's sacrifice, with Wainwright reaching first on the fielder's choice. Carpenter and Kolten Wong followed with RBI singles and Matt Holliday had an RBI groundout. Jay's single off reliever Chris Rusin with two outs made it 9-2.	Game notes	Renteria had a successful replay challenge in the third inning of first base umpire Jerry Layne's call on Jay's grounder to shortstop Starlin Castro. Layne had called Jay safe at first, but after reviewing the play, Jay was ruled out. ... St. Louis SS Jhonny Peralta, who has two hits in his first 32 at-bats for the lowest batting average among all qualifiers (.063), was given the day off. ... Castro, who had two hits, has hit safely in eight of his last nine games. ... Former Cardinal Edwin Jackson (0-0) will take the mound for the Cubs in the series finale Sunday against Michael Wacha (1-0). ... Craig was 1 for 12 on the homestand and hitless in his last eight at-bats before his second-inning single. ... With a victory Sunday, the Cubs can win a series for the first time since taking two of three from the Reds from Sept. 9-11 last season. Chicago has dropped eight straight series since.

Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Tommy Kahnle has been trying to tell anyone who will listen how good Colorado's bullpen is, even if the numbers suggest otherwise.	The Rockies middle reliever finally has some solid proof to back his claim. On a day the National League's top scoring offense was held to one run, the timing was perfect.	Kahnle and four relievers combined for two-hit ball over six innings after Brett Anderson was injured, leading Colorado to a 1-0 victory over Matt Cain and the San Francisco Giants on Saturday.	"It's definitely special," said Kahnle after the Rockies' bullpen lowered its collective ERA by nearly full point to 4.20. "Our bullpen's real good, especially coming into that spot where our starter gets taken out by a freak injury. Really it's just a big spot by us."	Troy Tulowitzki drove in the game's only run with a sacrifice fly in the third inning to help lift Colorado to just its second win in six road games this season. It's also just the Rockies' third win in their last 17 games at San Francisco's waterfront ballpark.	Kahnle (2-0) allowed one baserunner in two innings. Matt Belisle, Adam Ottavino, Rex Brothers and LaTroy Hawkins pitched an inning apiece to complete the three-hitter with Hawkins finishing for his second save.	"Usually if it's a one-run game here we're going the other way on it and probably lose," said Ottavino, who pitched a perfect seventh inning for Colorado. "Today was a good day. Everybody stepped up that needed to and we were able to hold them down and keep them quiet."	Anderson left the game with a bruised left index finger after allowing a hit in three innings. He did not require X-rays and is scheduled to be re-evaluated on Sunday.	Rockies relievers picked up the slack and extended their scoreless streak to 9 2/3 innings in this series.	A day after pitcher Madison Bumgarner hit a grand slam and drove in five runs, the Giants managed only three hits and were shut out for the first time this season.	"Their bullpen did a great job," San Francisco manager Bruce Bochy said. "We pitched good. They just pitched a little better."	Cain (0-2) allowed four hits over seven innings with eight strikeouts and three walks. He is winless in his last seven starts at AT&T Park.	Charlie Blackmon, the majors' leading hitter going in, scored after leading off the third with a walk. Blackmon took second on Brandon Barnes' infield single, moved to third as part of a double steal then came home on Tulowitzki's sacrifice fly.	"At the time you're not thinking that's the run that's going to win the game, but it was a big one," Colorado manager Walt Weiss said.	Tulowitzki went hitless in three at-bats in his return to Colorado's lineup after sitting out the series opener with a sore quad. Catcher Wilin Rosario was also back after resting a sore hand on Friday.	Even at full strength, the Rockies needed a big lift from their bullpen to pull this one out.	Anderson lasted just three innings after bruising the index finger on his left hand apparently while grounding out to end the top of the fourth. Anderson took the mound to begin the bottom of the frame and threw one warmup pitch before a team trainer was summoned from the dugout.	"It felt like a firecracker went off in my glove," Anderson said. "I went out there and threw a warmup pitch and it felt like what I envision trying to throw with a foam finger feels like."	Anderson eventually walked off the field and was replaced by Kahnle.	Pablo Sandoval greeted the Rockies reliever with a double to the gap in left-center on Kahnle's first pitch after center fielder Blackmon missed on a diving attempt. After Buster Posey walked, Kahnle got Mike Morse to ground into a double play and struck out Hector Sanchez.	The Giants couldn't do much else, spoiling Cain's strongest outing of the season.	San Francisco loaded the bases with two outs in the eighth but Brothers struck out Sandoval on five pitches to end the inning.	Game notes	Gonzalez went 0-for-4, ending his 10-game hitting streak. ... RHP Tyler Chatwood makes his season debut for the Rockies in the series finale on Sunday. RHP Tim Hudson (2-0) goes for San Francisco. ... Danielle Meulens, daughter of Giants hitting coach Hensley Meulens, sang the national anthem.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

BALTIMORE --  The Baltimore Orioles had to go into extra innings to earn a victory that seemed assured far earlier in the night.	Working overtime, however, did nothing to temper the enjoyment they derived from a 2-1 win over the Toronto Blue Jays on Saturday.	Steve Lombardozzi tripled and scored on a single by David Lough in the 12th inning for the Orioles, who also got a key RBI from rookie Jonathan Schoop.	Toronto trailed 1-0 with two outs in the ninth when Colby Rasmus hit a solo homer off Tommy Hunter on a 1-2 pitch. After nearly going around on a check swing one pitch earlier, Rasmus drove a 98 mph fastball into the right-field seats.	"He hit a pretty good fastball," Hunter said. "Sometimes you just tip your cap. He swung at a ball that was up. It was where I wanted. We talked about it afterward. One-run ballgame, you should probably throw the ball down and away instead of up, and he hit it."	In the 12th, Lombardozzi hit a one-out drive to center off Todd Redmond (0-1) before Lough sliced an opposite-field liner to left. As soon as Lombardozzi crossed the plate, the Orioles sprinted from the dugout to embrace Lough, who scored Baltimore's other run five innings earlier.	"It looked like we were going to wrap it up there but unfortunately they got a run," Lough said. "But we just buckled down, stayed in the game, kept our heads up and we were able to come through with the hit."	Zach Britton (2-0) got the win with two hitless innings of relief.	It was the second straight low-scoring affair between two AL East foes known for their offensive prowess. On Friday night, Toronto scored two unearned runs in a 2-0 victory.	In this one, neither starter allowed a run and neither got a victory for the effort. Bud Norris gave up five hits and three walks over seven innings for Baltimore and was poised to earn his first win of the season before Rasmus connected in the ninth.	"It didn't really do nothing for us," Rasmus lamented. "Most of the time when I face a guy who throws 98 (mph), I'm going to look for the fastball hoping that guy's going to challenge."	Drew Hutchison handcuffed the Orioles on four hits over six innings, walking two and striking out five.	"I have all the confidence in the world in our offense, just like the rest of our team does," the right-hander said. "It doesn't change my mindset one bit. My job is to go out and put up zeros."	After Hutchison left, the Orioles struck in the seventh against right-hander Neil Wagner. Lough singled with two outs before Schoop, the No. 9 hitter, lined a 3-2 pitch into the alley in right-center for an RBI double.	Evan Meek protected the lead in the eighth, but Hunter gave it away for his first blown save in four tries this season.	"You hopefully get a chance tomorrow," Hunter said. "The guys pulled it off, the team came through in the 12th. It's not a one-man show. There are a lot of guys, and I got picked up tonight."	The game featured the first replay challenge at Camden Yards. In the fourth inning, Lombardozzi reached on a grounder when umpire Chris Conroy ruled that a throw from Hutchison pulled first baseman Edwin Encarnacion off the bag. Toronto manager John Gibbons challenged the call, and after a delay of 2 minutes, 38 seconds, the decision stood.	Lough followed by hitting into an inning-ending double play.	Both teams threatened in the third. Toronto put runners at the corners with one out before Maicer Izturis hit a short flyball and Jose Bautista struck out.	In the bottom half, Hutchison struck out Chris Davis and Adam Jones after giving up successive one-out singles to Nick Markakis and Nelson Cruz.	Game notes	Ubaldo Jimenez (0-2, 6.75 ERA) seeks his first win with the Orioles on Sunday. Mark Buehrle (2-0, 0.64) will pitch for Toronto, which is 0-3 in series finales. ... Toronto SS Jose Reyes (hamstring) ran the bases, said he felt "very good" and expects to start a rehabilitation assignment with Class-A Dunedin on Monday. If all goes well, he could join the Blue Jays next Friday in Cleveland. Also, closer Casey Janssen (oblique) will pitch in Dunedin on Monday or Tuesday, Gibbons said. ... Orioles SS J.J. Hardy returned from a five-game absence with back spasms. ... Toronto's Melky Cabrera has hit in 12 straight games, tied with Vernon Wells (2006) for the longest streak in franchise history to start a season. ... It was the first time this season that a Blue Jays starter was not involved in the decision.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PHILADELPHIA -- Jimmy Rollins got some extra motivation in the 10th inning from a fan.	Rollins homered with two outs in the 10th inning Saturday night, and the Philadelphia Phillies overcame two home runs by Giancarlo Stanton to beat the Miami Marlins 5-4.	Rollins drove a 2-2 pitch from Dan Jennings (0-1) into the seats in left. It was the 201st career homer for Rollins, but just the second game-ender of his career. The first came June 23, 2010, against Cleveland.	Rollins said he was very upset with a comment directed toward him by a fan sitting near the home team's dugout during his final at-bat.	"There was some fan in the stands popping off," Rollins said. "He was right behind our dugout, close enough to yell and piss me off, honestly. It was something pretty ignorant, but it worked."	After hitting the ball, Rollins turned and yelled in the fan's direction.	Rollins said he told the fan to shut up, using an abbreviated expletive.	"I was locked and had some aggression. It just worked out I was able to tell him," Rollins said.	B.J. Rosenberg (1-0) pitched a scoreless 10th for the victory.	Rollins finished with three hits and hot-hitting Chase Utley had two doubles and drove in a run for Philadelphia, which has won 12 of 15 against the Marlins.	Through nine games, Utley is batting .500 with five doubles and eight RBIs.	Tony Gwynn Jr., starting in center and leading off for the second straight day in place of Ben Revere (sore ribs), had a pair of hits.	Stanton finished with three hits and three RBIs for the Marlins. His first homer, measured at 470 feet, cleared the seats in left-center and landed on Ashburn Alley -- a popular outfield concessions spot. The fifth-inning solo drive off Jonathan Pettibone pulled Miami to 4-2.	"I don't want to be a part of it, but you just go along with it," Pettibone said.	Stanton tied it at 4 in the seventh when he drilled reliever Justin De Fratus' first offering to deep left for a two-run shot. It was the 10th two-homer game for Stanton.	Stanton was due to bat second in the 11th if the game continued.	"We had Giancarlo coming up and that wasn't a good thing," Rollins said.	Said Phillies manager Ryne Sandberg, "The first two swings it looked like he had one thing in mind and that was not to play any more extra innings."	Rollins' RBI single and Utley's run-scoring double gave Philadelphia a 2-0 lead after one.	The Marlins got a run back in the second and would have scored at least two more if not for replay.	Second base umpire Gary Cederstrom called Marcell Ozuna safe at second, saying that Ozuna beat shortstop Rollins to the bag on a forceout after Utley ranged right and threw to Rollins on Stanton's grounder up the middle.	But Sandberg challenged and, after a 2 minute, 27 seconds delay, umpires overturned the call. Replays showed that Rollins touched the bag before Ozuna for the final out.	"It really cost us a couple of runs," Marlins manager Mike Redmond said.	Adeiny Hechavarria had scored, Christian Yelich likely would have scored and the Marlins then would've had runners on first and second with two outs.	"Normally that would be a huge play in the game," Sandberg said. "I'm glad it went in our favor. It was a successful challenge and big in that moment."	Miami did get some good fortune in the inning as Ryan Howard dropped Rollins' throw to first on Ozuna's grounder to shortstop that would've been the final out. Jarrod Saltalamacchia scored from third on Howard's error.	The Phillies went ahead 4-1 in the third on Utley's double and Howard's single.	Pettibone, activated from Triple-A Lehigh Valley for the game, allowed two runs -- one earned -- on eight hits in five innings in his season debut. Pettibone is filling in until left-hander Cole Hamels (left biceps tendinitis) returns to the rotation.	Miami starter Nate Eovaldi went 6⅓ innings, giving up four runs on seven hits while striking out five and walking none.	Game notes	Hamels pitched six strong innings in a rehab start for Class-A Clearwater on Saturday night, giving up one run on six hits with six strikeouts and no walks. ... Revere grounded out pinch hitting in the 10th. ... In order to activate Pettibone, the Phillies sent right-hander Brad Lincoln outright to Triple-A Lehigh Valley. ... Saturday marked the 10th anniversary of the opening of Citizens Bank Park on April 12, 2004. ... Miami's Derek Dietrich was a late scratch from the lineup due to lower back tightness. Jeff Baker started at second for him. ... The three-game series concludes at 1:35 Sunday when Philadelphia RHP Kyle Kendrick (0-1, 3.75) faces Marlins RHP Henderson Alvarez (0-2, 4.15).	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MILWAUKEE -- Jim Henderson got the big out, and made the big play.	Henderson pitched a scoreless inning of relief, getting a Andrew McCutchen to pop out and applying the tag on a runner cut down at home in the eighth, as Milwaukee ran its winning streak to eight with a 3-2 victory against Pittsburgh on Saturday night.	With runners on first and third and one out, McCutchen hit a towering popup behind home plate. Lucroy made the catch and Travis Snider attempted to tag up from first, but Lucroy alertly threw to shortstop Jean Segura covering the bag. As Snider retreated toward first, Starling Marte broke for home but was tagged out by Henderson (1-0) covering the plate to end the inning.	"My focus was just to get my glove out in front of the plate. I actually really didn't know where I was positioned on the plate," Henderson said.	"I'm glad I covered home in the first place. Some pitchers just hang out by the mound."	After making the tag and recording an extremely rare 2-6-1 double play, Henderson spiked the ball to the ground as he left the field.	"It was in the moment and McCutchen is always a tough out for me," Henderson said.	Lucroy said he broke to cover the plate but backed off when he saw Henderson was already there.	"That was a really weird play but it's got to be the top play. It was awesome," Lucroy said.	Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said Snider breaking from first base planned.	"It's a play that we have in place that we work on all spring that won us a ball game last year. We tag at first, draw the throw to second and then send the runner from third. Marte breaks on the throw, they had to make a baseball play. We tried to steal a run," Hurdle said.	Carlos Gomez hit a leadoff homer and Lucroy drove in the tiebreaking run with an eighth-inning single.	Gomez got Milwaukee started with a 432-foot drive to center field off Edinson Volquez, and Khris Davis scored on a wild pitch to make it 2-0 in the second.	Pittsburgh tied it in the third on Starling Marte's groundout and Travis Snider's single, snapping Yovani Gallardo's scoreless streak to start the season at 14 2/3 innings. Gallardo struck out Pedro Alvarez to end the inning with two runners in scoring position. The right-hander then held the Pirates scoreless over the next three innings, striking out the side in the fifth.	Lucroy singled to right in the eighth to drive in Ryan Braun, who slid in ahead of the throw to the plate.	Francisco Rodriguez got his fourth save in four attempts.	Gallardo went six innings, giving up two runs and six hits. He struck out six and walked one. He is 11-4 in his career against the Pirates.	Volquez, making his second start of the season along with one relief appearance, gave up two runs and four hits in 6 1/3 innings. He struck out four and walked two.	The Pirates threatened in the sixth when Andrew McCutchen doubled with one out and moved to third on a groundout. Gallardo struck out Russell Martin looking to end the inning.	The Brewers (9-2) put runners on second and third with one out in the seventh against Volquez. Tony Watson retired the next two batters to keep the score tied.	The Brewers broke through in the eighth. One-out singles by Braun and Aramis Ramirez off reliever Mark Melancon (0-1) put runners on first and second for Lucroy.	Gomez's home run was the lone extra-base hit for the Brewers. Doubles by McCutchen and Travis Ishikawa accounted for the Pirates' only extra-base hits.	Game notes	McCutchen was back in the lineup after being lifted in the eighth inning of Friday night's game with a sore ankle. ... Gomez received his 2013 Gold Glove before the game. He was the first Brewers player to win a Gold Glove since shortstop Robin Yount in 1982. ... It was Gomez's second leadoff homer of the season. ... Milwaukee RHP Kyle Lohse (1-1) faces RHP Charlie Morton (0-0) in the series finale Sunday.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ATLANTA -- The Braves keep finding ways to beat the Nationals, who now must find a way to overcome a sudden wave of injuries.	Freddie Freeman had three hits, including a homer, and Atlanta beat Washington 6-3 on Saturday night to continue its early success against the Nationals.	Washington third baseman Ryan Zimmerman left the game with a broken right thumb and is expected to miss four to six weeks. Nationals leadoff hitter and center fielder Denard Span was placed on the seven-day disabled list before the game with a concussion.	"It is what it is. Nobody is going to feel sorry for us," manager Matt Williams said. "You've got to play."	B.J. Upton had two hits, including his first homer, and Dan Uggla drove in two runs with two hits for Atlanta.	After winning two of three at Washington in the opening week, the Braves have won the first two games of a weekend home series against their NL East rivals. Since the start of the 2013 season, Atlanta has won 17 of the last 24 games in the rivalry.	Braves left-hander Alex Wood (2-1) allowed one run on six hits and three walks in five innings. Craig Kimbrel pitched the ninth for his fifth save.	Upton, who began the night hitting .135, and Uggla, batting .162, finally got untracked.	"It was good to see some of the guys start putting good at-bats together," Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "B.J. had four good at-bats."	Justin Upton had three hits, including two doubles, to extend his tear at the plate. Evan Gattis also had three hits.	Washington starter Taylor Jordan (0-1) allowed five runs on 10 hits and two walks in five innings.	"I just wasn't hitting my spots, and they capitalized on that," Jordan said.	Washington's Anthony Rendon hit his second homer leading off the game.	Zimmerman was hurt diving back to the bag when he was picked off second base in the fifth.	"I think he did it on the bag," Williams said. "It's unfortunate, but we've got to step forward from here."	Following Zimmerman's exit, Rendon moved from second base to third and Danny Espinosa entered the game at second base.	"It's not our first choice, certainly, but the fact they can play multiple positions is good in times like this," Williams said.	Span had headaches following a collision on the basepath with Uggla on Friday night.	Right fielder Jayson Werth, who left Friday night's game with cramping in his groin, did not start. He had a pinch-hit infield single in the eighth following Sandy Leon's run-scoring single. Freeman's throwing error on Werth's hit left runners at first and third, but Rendon's fly to center ended the inning.	Washington's makeshift outfield included Bryce Harper in center, Kevin Frandsen in left and Nate McLouth in right.	After giving up Rendon's leadoff homer, Wood allowed at least two baserunners in each of his next four innings. He threw 103 pitches.	"Somehow I managed to get through five," Wood said, adding the pickoff of Zimmerman "was huge" because he was on the verge of being pulled from the game.	Williams used his replay challenge in the second inning after McLouth, credited with a sacrifice bunt, was called out at first base. The call by umpire Angel Hernandez stood following a video review.	Williams could have used his challenge two innings later when replays indicated first baseman Adam LaRoche snagged a liner by Freeman as Jason Heyward advanced from first to second. LaRoche stepped on the bag for an apparent double play, but the umpires huddled -- with Williams standing a few feet away -- and ruled the ball hit the ground before the catch was made.	McLouth was involved in another questionable call in the fifth when he dropped a flyball hit by Andrelton Simmons. Replays indicated McLouth made the catch and was transferring the ball to his glove when it fell to the ground, but Hernandez ruled it was not a catch. The call left the bases loaded, but Jordan escaped by striking out pinch-hitter Ryan Doumit and Heyward.	Right-hander Blake Treinen, called up from Triple-A Syracuse before the game, pitched two scoreless innings in his major league debut.	Game notes	The Nationals also recalled OF Steven Souza Jr. and optioned RHP Blake Barrett to Syracuse. ... Gattis tied his career high with three hits. ... Justin Upton is 11 for 19 with three homers in the first five games of the homestand. ... The Nationals were charged with three errors, including two throwing miscues by SS Ian Desmond. ... The series ends Sunday when Atlanta RHP Aaron Harang faces LHP Gio Gonzalez.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Robbie Grossman is finding his stroke, and the Houston Astros are benefiting from his new-found power.	Grossman hit a two-out, three-run home run capped a five-run fourth inning, and Houston beat the Texas Rangers 6-5 in 10 innings Saturday night.	The long ball comes two days after he snapped a 25 at-bat hitless skid with a two-run drive in Houston's win at Toronto.	"You have to have confidence in your ability, especially in the big leagues," Grossman said. "This game is too hard not to."	Jason Castro tripled with one out in the 10th, and Jose Altuve had a tiebreaking sacrifice fly to score the run that helped Houston end a 12-game skid against their state rival.	Marwin Gonzalez, running for Castro, scored on Altuve's fly off Rangers closer Joakim Soria (1-1).	"That was a big, big, big hit for Robbie," Astros manager Bo Porter said. "He continues to swing the bat. I told him, `It ain't going to last for long (his slump). Just keep swinging."	Michael Choice hit his first career homer in the ninth to tie it as Texas rallied in the eighth and the ninth to send the teams into extra innings for the second straight night.	Kevin Chapman (1-0) allowed Choice's tying homer but was the winning pitcher. Anthony Bass pitched the 10th for his second save. Texas put runners on first and third with one out in the ninth before Bass struck out Kevin Kouzmanoff and got Choice to ground out to first base.	Shin-Soo Choo came into the game having reached base 12 of his previous 16 plate appearances but struck out all five times up, including with the winning run at second base with two out in the ninth.	Houston starter Jarred Cosart shut down Texas after allowing three runs in the first four innings, limiting the Rangers to six hits while striking out a career-high eight in seven innings.	"The knock last year was the walks were too high and the strikeouts were too low," Cosart said. "It's something I really worked on in spring training."	The Rangers' streak against Houston was the longest streak in the majors between any two teams. Texas has won 18 of 21 meetings over Houston since the beginning of last season, when the state rivals became intradivision foes with the Astros moving from the National League into the American League West.	Tanner Scheppers, making his third career start since transitioning this season from short relief, was victimized by the big inning for the second time this season.	"It's a step forward," Rangers manager Ron Washington said. "It's a learning experience."	The Rangers pulled within one in the eighth when Alex Rios' double off the wall in left center scored Elvis Andrus with none out. But Rios was thrown out trying to steal third with Prince Fielder at the plate, and Texas didn't threaten again.	"Sometimes you try to make things easier," Rios said, "and you make them a little harder."	Texas scored five batters in but left two on in the opening inning. Cosart retired 10 of the last 11 batters that he faced.	Game notes	 Rangers GM Jon Daniels said the club is leaning toward placing 3B Adrian Beltre on the disabled list and should decide by Monday. Beltre has been sidelined since Tuesday with a strained left quad. ... Houston called up RHP Paul Clemens from Triple-A Oklahoma City and placed RHP Scott Feldman on the bereavement list. Astros manager Bo Porter said Feldman, who pitched Friday after his father, Marshall, died Wednesday, could miss a start. ... Texas acquired RHP pitcher Hector Noesi on Saturday from Seattle for a player to be named later or cash considerations.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

PHOENIX -- Adrian Gonzalez must love it when he sees the word "Arizona" on the opposing uniform.	Chances are he's in for a big night.	Gonzalez did it again Saturday night, hitting a two-run homer to help the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Diamondbacks 8-5.	Zack Greinke (3-0) scattered eight hits but allowed one run in 5 1/3 innings for Los Angeles.	Gonzalez, who had a two-run homer and five RBIs in the series opener Friday, followed that up with a shot to the left-field seats off Wade Miley (2-2) with two outs in the third inning.	Gonzalez has 26 career home runs and 84 RBIs against the Diamondbacks, most of any active player in both categories.	He left without talking to reporters on Saturday, but said the previous night he had no good explanation for the success.	Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said in a career players just have opponents like that.	"There's nothing like good vibes," he said. "You walk into a building and know you've swung the bat good there. There is something to that. You walk in feeling good because you have good memories. A place you go and you've been shut out for five years, you don't have the same type of feeling."	The Dodgers scored 14 runs in the first two games of the series.	"I think Arizona is just a good place to hit," Mattingly said. "You see the ball good here. We have one more day here and then you end up in AT&T (in San Francisco) and the ball doesn't carry and it's not the same. But we have swung the bats well. A lot of contributions from different people."	Greinke succeeded even though he was not at his best.	"It's nice to have a pitch that you can just go to at any time," he said. "I didn't really have that today. But there was a lot of usable pitches."	Miley gave up five runs and eight hits in five innings.	A.J. Pollock had a pinch-hit homer for the Diamondbacks, who scored three in the ninth off Brandon League, two on Mark Trumbo's two-out double.	Kenley Jansen came in to strike out Gerardo Parra and earn his third save.	Juan Uribe doubled twice and had a two-run single for Los Angeles. Yasiel Puig had a pair of singles, driving in a run.	The Dodgers, who have won four of five, got the leadoff batter on base five times in the first six innings, three via walks, and four of them scored.	Arizona fell to 4-10.	"We don't like losing," manager Kirk Gibson said. "It never makes you feel good. Guys are pressing. They are trying to do well and reverse this cycle, this trend. When it continues to happen it is frustrating."	Los Angeles scored twice without an out in the second inning. Gonzalez drew a leadoff walk, Scott Van Slyke doubled to put runners at second and third, and Uribe singled to bring both of them home.	Puig led off the third with a single, then with two outs Gonzalez homered to make it 4-0 and give the slugger seven RBIs in the first 12 innings of the series.	Los Angeles added a fifth run in the fourth. Justin Turner led off with a double and scored on Puig's two-out single.	Arizona finally got a run after being blanked for the first 13 innings of the series when Pollock led off the fifth with a home run to the porch in right-center, his first career pinch-hit homer.	The Dodgers got an unearned run without a hit in the sixth. Oliver Perez walked Drew Butera to start the inning. Greinke's bunt advanced the runner to second, then Butera scored when third baseman Martin Prado couldn't handle Matt Kemp's sharp grounder.	J.J. Putz walked Hanley Ramirez with the bases loaded and two outs in the eighth to make it 7-1. Cliff Pennington singled in Arizona's second run in the eighth.	Game notes	With the left-hander Miley on the mound, the Dodgers sat left-handed batters Ethier and Carl Crawford. ... The Dodgers have Dan Haren (2-0, 0.75 ERA) on the mound Sunday while struggling Trevor Cahill (0-3, 7.90) goes for Arizona. ... The Diamondbacks have lost four of five series to start the season. ... The Diamondbacks have struck out 23 times in the first two games of the series.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

SAN DIEGO -- Sometime soon, a baseball will be getting a prominent spot among the trophies on Justin Verlander's mantle.	It's the ball he hit up the middle for a single in the second inning Saturday night, the one that will forever shut up his teammates.	Verlander had the first two hits of his career and recovered from throwing 31 pitches in the first inning to pitch seven strong innings and lead the Detroit Tigers to a 6-2 victory over the San Diego Padres on Saturday night.	"It felt great. It's been a long time and I can finally get all these guys off my back ...," Verlander said.	Verlander had been 0 for 26 with 15 strikeouts in his career when he stepped in against Ian Kennedy in the second inning and singled up the middle. When the ball came back to Kennedy, he tossed it to a ball boy near the Padres' dugout. Home plate umpire Seth Buckminster motioned for the ball boy to throw it to the Tigers' dugout.	"I think the Padres and probably Ian didn't know that I had never had a hit," Verlander said. "It's been nine years in the big leagues now. They probably weren't thinking about that but I sure as heck was. I was watching that ball like a hawk."	The last time Verlander had a hit?	"High school. It's been a long time," he said.	"I guess I have no more leverage," catcher Alex Avila said. "We're all happy for him. It was fun to watch."	Verlander cited a list of times when he came close to getting a hit.	"I think it's kind of been an anomaly that I haven't had one yet," he said. "I feel like I've probably hit five or six hard that have been caught."	Verlander singled to right in the fourth, although he had to hustle to avoid being thrown out by Chris Denorfia.	"I hit it pretty hard, too. It was a bang-bang play but I beat it out, thank goodness," said Verlander, who eventually scored on Torii Hunter's two-run single.	The sight of Verlander (1-1) on the mound at Petco Park was another reminder of how the Padres flubbed the top pick in the June 2004 amateur draft. Not wanting to pay a big signing bonus, the team passed on players such as Jered Weaver, Stephen Drew and Verlander in favor of local shortstop Matt Bush.	Bush, who signed for $3 million, never reached the big leagues and had numerous off-field problems. In December 2012, he was sentenced to four years and three months in a Florida prison for a drunken driving hit-and-run crash.	Verlander was taken by the Tigers with the second pick. He has thrown two no-hitters and came within two outs of a third, won the AL MVP and Cy Young Award in 2011, was voted AL Rookie of the Year in 2006 and is a six-time All-Star.	Verlander allowed two runs and eight hits, struck out eight and walked one. He improved to 2-0 against the Padres, having also beaten them at Petco Park in 2008.	"He's a guy who obviously has that power arm when he needs to," San Diego's Yonder Alonso said. "He works his way into the game and if he feels like he's in trouble, he's going to attack. He made some good pitches but we just missed a lot of guys on base."	The Tigers had plenty of offense one night after being held to one hit by Andrew Cashner in a 6-0 loss. Austin Jackson hit a two-run double one batter after Miguel Cabrera was intentionally walked to load the bases in the ninth; Hunter, who missed the previous two games with a bruised left knee, hit a two-run single; and Cabrera and Ian Kinsler each had an RBI double. Rajai Davis scored three runs.	San Diego got its runs on Jedd Gyorko's sacrifice fly and Yasmani Grandal's RBI single.	Kennedy (1-2) allowed four runs and eight hits in six innings. He struck out seven and walked one.	Game notes	A candidate in the Padres' in-season contest to find a new public address announcer committed a big flub in the first inning. As Cabrera, the two-time AL MVP, walked to the plate, he was announced as Austin Jackson. Cabrera turned and looked up at the booth. Frank Anthony, the Padres' PA announcer since Petco Park opened in 2004, was fired in January so the team could hold open tryouts as part of the 10th anniversary of Petco Park. ... The series concludes Sunday when reigning AL Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer (0-0, 1.20 ERA) is scheduled to face Tyson Ross (0-2, 4.35).	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- After blowing a three-run lead in the ninth inning on one ill-fated pitch to Raul Ibanez, Jose Valverde needed a lift, and so did his New York Mets teammates.	They got one four innings later from Anthony Recker.	The backup catcher, the eighth batter in the lineup, led off the 13th with a home run off rookie Matt Shoemaker and also had a two-run single earlier, leading the Mets to a 7-6 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Saturday night.	"Obviously, it's great to be able to pick him up," Recker said of Valverde. "We want him to have confidence every time he goes out there -- because, let's face it, he's a pretty darn good pitcher. So we don't want to lose that."	The Mets evened up their interleague series at a game apiece, but it wasn't easy. Valverde came on in the ninth to protect a 6-3 lead for Jonathon Niese, but the 41-year-old Ibanez drove Valverde's 1-0 pitch deep into the right-field seats after David Freese singled with two outs and Erick Aybar walked. The homer was Ibanez's 302nd in the majors -- and his 2,000th hit.	Valverde, who converted all 49 save chances in 2011 for the Tigers, was the 239th pitcher Ibanez has homered against in 19 big league seasons.	"Jose wasn't able to come through tonight, but I know he will next time," Recker said. "He's been there before. He's been through the good and the bad. He's a veteran, and he'll be OK. We just look forward to moving on from here and getting some more wins."	Omar Quintanilla, the Mets' No. 9 hitter, provided some temporary insurance in the ninth with a two-run single off Kevin Jepsen. But Valverde, who spent the previous four years in Detroit and lost his closer role last season, ended up with his first blown save in three chances since signing with the Mets as a free agent in February.	"We didn't know what was going to happen," manager Terry Collins said. "He didn't pitch a lot last year, so we were hoping that the added rest was going to help him get some arm strength back. And he's throwing the ball very well. Tonight's really the worst outing he's had. But the at-bat by Aybar is the one that dismantled him. I was told that when he walks people, he gets in trouble."	Shoemaker (0-1), the eighth Angels pitcher, escaped his own bases-loaded jam in the 12th by striking out Juan Lagares. But Recker drove the right-hander's second pitch of the 13th into the left-field bullpen for his first homer this season.	"The 12th inning was a momentum boost. It got us going and it got me going. That was exciting," Shoemaker said. "I tried to stay in there as long as could to give the team a chance to win. But the next inning, I was supposed to be locating the fastball low and away and definitely missed my spot. It was much higher than it was supposed to be, and he didn't miss it."	John Lannan (1-0) pitched two perfect innings for the victory.	Niese allowed three runs and six hits in 7 1/3 innings with five strikeouts and a walk.	Jered Weaver was charged with four runs, three hits and four walks in 6 2/3 innings and struck out five. Lucas Duda's two-out solo homer in the second was the Mets' only hit against him until the seventh, when Duda singled Curtis Granderson -- who walked -- to third with two outs. Lagares followed with an RBI single on Weaver's 99th and final pitch.	"He struggled a little bit with location early, but he was able to get by and still made a lot of pitches to get out of trouble," catcher Chris Iannetta said. "In the middle of the game, I thought he pitched great. That last inning he made one tough pitch and that was it. Other than that, it was a really good ballgame for him.	"I think it's more of a mechanical issue that he's fighting right now. He just needs to make a couple of adjustments here and there, but it's minor. He'll be fine. I'm not necessarily worried about that."	Recker greeted Fernando Salas with a sinking liner to center field that bounced off Mike Trout's glove as he attempted to make a diving catch. The hit gave the Mets a 4-3 lead.	Iannetta homered for the Angels in the fifth, thwarted an attempted double steal and tagged out a runner at the plate to complete a double play started by left fielder Collin Cowgill -- who also homered against Niese, in the sixth.	Game notes	Pujols had 21 homers, 63 RBIs and a .311 average in 71 career games against the Mets during his 11 seasons with St. Louis. ... Weaver is 27-15 with a 3.38 ERA in 51 starts since his no-hitter against Minnesota on May 2, 2012. ... The Angels obtained Cowgill from the Mets last June in a trade that sent OF Kyle Johnson to Flushing. ... Duda's homer was his first in 27 career at-bats as a designated hitter to that point. ... Freese was 0-for-3 against Niese and is hitless in 12 career at-bats against the left-hander, who struck him out with a runner at third to end the fourth.

SEATTLE --  The consensus afterward was the best from Oakland's Sonny Gray is yet to show.	This after the young right-hander overcame a shaky beginning to shut down Seattle for seven innings, giving up one run and matching his career high with nine strikeouts in the Athletics' 3-1 win over the Mariners on Saturday night.	"We still haven't seen his best game," Oakland manager Bob Melvin said. "At times he gets a little erratic with where he's throwing his fastball, but a lot of times the ball has a mind of its own, too. It will cut, it will sink, it will do a lot of different things. That's a strength of his too because the hitters never get a read on his fastball."	Gray didn't disagree with his manager's assessment, even if in the bigger picture he's off to a fantastic start. Gray has allowed only two earned runs in three starts this season and earned his second win in a week against Seattle.	Gray (2-0) gave up his only run in the first when Seattle failed to capitalize on having runners at first and third and no outs. Gray stymied the Mariners from there, allowing only singles to Logan Morrison in the fourth and Robinson Cano in the sixth, and a double by Dustin Ackley in the seventh.	Oakland won for the fifth time in six games.	"I definitely felt good tonight and was able to make a lot of pitches but it's still something I have to get better at," Gray said. "I have to prepare better for the early innings and something we're still working with. I have to be able to get into that routine that rhythm early on. We'll work on it, we'll get better at it and we'll see what happens."	Josh Donaldson provided Gray all the offense he needed, lining a 2-0 pitch from Seattle starter Erasmo Ramirez (1-2) over the hand-operated scoreboard for a two-run homer in the first inning.	Oakland also got a wacky RBI single in the third from Brandon Moss that scored Coco Crisp, but the A's should have scored more against the erratic Ramirez. In each of his five innings, Ramirez allowed the leadoff batter to reach. He gave up six hits and walked three, but managed to get through five innings, helping save Seattle's bullpen.	"I don't know what happened today," Ramirez said. "The last two starts have been, I don't know, the ball is just running too much now."	Moss' RBI came on a play where he was out for passing the runner ahead of him, one of two plays involving Ackley in left field. Ackley made a sliding grab of Moss' drive to left center but lost the ball. Donaldson, who was on first, headed back when he saw Ackley glove the ball and was passed by Moss, creating the out.	Then in the sixth, Yoenis Cespedes hit a line drive to Ackley that he again lost just before he could transfer the ball to his bare hand. Cespedes believed he was out and never made it to first base, stopping short and heading back to the dugout. Ackley threw to shortstop Brad Miller, who threw to first for the unusual 7-6-3 putout.	Donaldson was not pleased with how the rule is being implemented.	"I've been playing baseball for over 20 years now. If a ball goes in a glove it's always been a catch to me," Donaldson said. "It does make it tough as a base runner when a guy is diving and you see it go in his glove the first instinct is to go back, not to watch him transfer the ball to his hand. It's chaos."	Cano had Seattle's lone RBI on a groundout in the first that scored Abraham Almonte but scoring chances were few for the Mariners. Gray got strikeouts of Ackley and Almonte in the fourth and seventh innings to end scoring chances for Seattle.	Sean Doolittle got four outs before Luke Gregerson finished off his first save despite giving up two singles in the ninth.	Game notes	 Gray has won his last five decisions going back to September 2013. . ... RHP Chris Young will make his first start for Seattle on Sunday. Manager Lloyd McClendon said they would likely need to limit Young to about 90 pitches. Young has made only one appearance so far with the Mariners. ...

CINCINNATI -- The Reds went two weeks before breaking out of their hitting slump.	Chris Heisey connected for his first grand slam and Devin Mesoraco homered and drove in a career high-tying four runs as Cincinnati took advantage of Tampa Bay's depleted pitching staff for a 12-4 victory on Sunday.	The Reds' best offensive showing of the season featured Mesoraco's three-run homer, Joey Votto's two-run shot and Heisey's pinch-hit slam in the eighth. Jay Bruce doubled, walked four times and scored four runs.	The Reds had a brief meeting following a 1-0 loss on Saturday that epitomized their season-long struggle at the plate.	"The key early in the season is to not lose faith," manager Bryan Price said. "We understand that we're a good team, and everyone in there knows it."	For the first time all season, they played like it.	The Reds salvaged the final game of their interleague series but remained in last place in the NL Central at 4-8. The hitters have been the biggest problem, tied for last in the majors heading into the game.	Zack Cozart got it going with a bases-loaded double off Cesar Ramos (0-1), making his first start of the season because of injuries. The Reds finished with a season high in runs -- they hadn't scored more than six in any previous game -- and hits with 13.	"It's so early that you really can't say we're not going to hit with runners in scoring position," Mesoraco said. "We've just got to bear down and try not to do too much."	Left-hander Tony Cingrani (1-1) gave up five hits in 6 1/3 innings. Ben Zobrist homered from both sides of the plate, hitting two-run shots off Cingrani and right-hander Nick Christiani.	"It was great to see them come through and break out and get five runs (early)," Cingrani said. "It was just a matter of time. We've got a great hitting lineup. Today was the day they broke out of it."	The Rays are 3-3 on a trip that has been tough on their rotation. Matt Moore went on the disabled list with a sore elbow on Tuesday, and Alex Cobb joined him Sunday with a strained oblique. Also, reliever Joel Peralta was sick, leaving him unavailable.	The injuries affected the final game of the series. Ramos, who had made four relief appearances this season, started in Moore's place and helped the Reds' offense get unstuck.	"One of those days, man," manager Joe Maddon said. "You just file it and move on. This is less than the 30-minute rule. This is the 30-second rule. Just drop it and move on."	Cincinnati came into the game tied with San Diego for fewest runs in the majors with 28. Ramos helped the Reds by walking the bases loaded in the second, and Cozart hit a ground-rule double for his third hit of the season and a 2-0 lead.	Votto's second homer of the series sparked a 10-batter, five-run third inning. Ramos left after throwing 47 pitches. Brandon Gomes relieved and gave up Mesoraco's homer.	Mesoraco added a sacrifice fly in the fifth. The catcher opened the season on the disabled list with a strained oblique. In four games the past week, he went 7 for 14 with three doubles, two homers and six RBIs.	Heisey connected in the eighth off Josh Lueke for his seventh career pinch-hit homer.	Game notes	The Rays open a three-game series in Baltimore on Monday, starting Chris Archer (1-0) against Wei-Yin Chen (1-1). ... The Reds continue their six-game homestand by hosting Pittsburgh. Homer Bailey (0-1), who has won his last five starts against the Pirates, goes against Wandy Rodriguez (0-2). ... Rays called up LH reliever Jeff Beliveau from Triple-A Durham to fill Cobb's roster spot and sent him back after the game. LH Erik Bedard, who also was added to the roster on Sunday, will take Cobb's spot in the rotation for now. ... It was Zobrist's fourth career multihomer game. ... Maddon batted Ramos eighth, figuring that he'd have to pinch-hit for him early anyway. ... Reds starter Mat Latos was diagnosed with a sprained right forearm. He won't throw for 10 to 14 days. ... Third base umpire Tim Welke was honored before he worked his 4,000th regular-season game.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BALTIMORE -- When the Toronto Blue Jays broke out their two-week slump at the plate, nothing could stop them from circling the bases -- except a gaffe by an overeager ball girl.	Jose Bautista launched a three-run homer and Colby Rasmus and Brett Lawrie added solo shots as the Blue Jays set season highs for runs and hits Sunday to beat the Baltimore Orioles 11-3 Sunday.	"We figured it was a matter of time and we knew it was going to happen," manager John Gibbons said. "We know we have a good lineup."	"It was a good all-around effort," he said.	A ball girl at Camden Yards turned in an excellent effort, too. But too bad for her, it came on a ball that was still in play.	It was 1-all in the fourth when Adam Lind walked on four pitches and Edwin Encarnacion hit a hard grounder down the third base line. The ball girl near the left-field seats quickly ran to field it, making a neat pickup.	She took delight in her play until she realized sheepishly that she interfered with a live ball, which forced Lind to stop at third on the ground-rule double.	Dioner Navarro followed with a run-scoring groundout and Jonathan Diaz executed a perfect suicide squeeze on a pitch that came in at eye level.	Encarnacion, Lind and Rasmus each got three of the Blue Jays' 17 hits, and six different players had RBIs. Toronto had scored four runs or fewer in 10 of its first 12 games.	Mark Buehrle (3-0) gave up one run on five hits, walked none and struck out two over seven innings. The left-hander has allowed only two runs in 21 innings, an 0.86 ERA.	"It means I'm getting really lucky and I'm fooling a lot of people," Buehrle said. "I don't know what's going on."	Chris Davis hit his first homer of the season for Baltimore, an eighth-inning drive off Esmil Rogers. Davis had a major league-leading 53 home runs last year.	Matt Wieters also connected for the Orioles, who scored only five runs in losing two of three to Toronto.	Ubaldo Jimenez (0-3) allowed five runs and 10 hits over 5 1/3 innings in his third straight ineffective start. Signed to a four-year contract as a free agent in February, the right-hander has yielded 23 hits in 16 innings and owns a 7.31 ERA.	"You want to win, you want to be there for your team," Jimenez said. "But I know it's part of the game. I can't give up, I can't put my head down and feel sorry for myself. I have to keep working hard and find a way to be there."	Toronto pulled away with a five-run seventh, its biggest inning of the year. Lawrie hit a solo shot before Rasmus and Encarnacion hit two-run doubles off Josh Stinson.	Bautista connected in the eighth against Stinson to make it 11-1. Five of his nine hits this year are home runs.	In addition to hitting the ball hard, the Blue Jays played sound defense. Rasmus deftly chased down two flyballs in center and Lawrie made a sensational stop and throw at third base to rob Jonathan Schoop of a hit in the fifth inning.	"(Buehrle) had some defense behind him," Gibbons said. "He pitches to contact. They hit some balls deep but he kept them in the ballpark."	Rasmus put Toronto up 1-0 in the first inning with his second home run in two games, a towering drive that became the 78th in the 23-year history of Camden Yards to land on Eutaw Street beyond the right field wall.	Baltimore pulled even in the bottom half when Nick Markakis singled and scored on a groundout by Adam Jones. But the Orioles wasted a leadoff double by Steve Pearce in the second, leaving them 0 for 6 with runners in scoring position.	"As an offense, we definitely want to score some more runs early in the game," Davis said. "When you go up there and put up a run early, you've got to continue to score runs. Tip your hat to Buehrle. He's been around. He knows how to pitch. He used our aggressiveness against us today."	Game notes	Toronto 2B Maicer Izturis was put on the DL after the game with a sprained left knee. ... The Blue Jays have Monday off before opening a three-game series in Minnesota. The Orioles send Wei-Yin Chen to the mound Monday night in the opener of a three-game series against Tampa Bay. ... Jones reached on an infield single in the third inning for his 1,000th career hit. ... Toronto's Melky Cabrera extended his hitting streak to 13 games, longest in franchise history to start a season. ... Bautista has reached in all 13 games either by hit or walk.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ATLANTA -- Freddie Freeman insists the Atlanta Braves have no special insight when playing the Washington Nationals.	"I don't know if it's about getting in their heads," Freeman said. "You just want to go out there and win series. It doesn't matter who it's against."	Freeman and Justin Upton each hit a two-run homer off Gio Gonzalez and the Braves completed a three-game sweep of the Nationals with a 10-2 victory on Sunday.	Beating Washington for the 18th time in the last 25 series matchups, Atlanta is hoping to use another fast start against the Nationals to win a second straight NL East title.	The Braves have won five of six against the Nationals this year.	"We have a 19-game stretch against division opponents," Freeman said. "This is where you can get off to a good start and get off to a good lead and hopefully we'll keep playing well when we get to" Philadelphia to begin a four-game series Monday.	Washington began the day by placing third baseman Ryan Zimmerman on the 15-day disabled list with a broken right thumb. He'll be out four to six weeks.	With Zimmerman and leadoff hitter Denard Span sidelined, the Nationals' lineup managed just five hits off Aaron Harang (2-1), who allowed one run, one walk and struck out five in six innings.	Gonzalez (2-1) continued his struggles against the Braves, giving up nine hits, six runs and four walks and striking out six in six innings.	Despite ranking second in the majors among left-handers with 34 wins since the start of 2012, Gonzalez is 2-7 with a 5.31 ERA in 10 starts against the Braves during that span.	He hasn't received more than one run of support in any of his seven winless starts against Atlanta.	"We were catching bad breaks," Gonzalez said. "We were making some big mistakes, and as a starting pitcher you've got to learn to adjust and keep the ball down."	Harang, making his 322nd career start and third with the Braves, improved to 2-4 with a 3.72 ERA in 10 starts against Washington.	Gus Schlosser, Atlanta's fourth pitcher, gave up Adam LaRoche's third homer in the ninth to make it 10-2.	Ross Detwiler, Washington's second pitcher, allowed four unearned runs in the eighth on Freeman's RBI double and Andrelton Simmons' first homer, a three-run shot that put the Braves up 10-1.	Gonzalez's struggles began in the first.	After walking leadoff hitter Jason Heyward, Gonzalez made an errant underhanded throw to first baseman LaRoche on B.J. Upton's bunt single. The ball rolled away from LaRoche, allowing Heyward to advance to third and B.J. Upton to second.	Freeman's sacrifice fly scored Heyward, and Justin Upton homered to make it 3-0. Over his last six games, Justin Upton is hitting .590 with four homers in 22 at-bats.	"We know what we're capable of and what we want to achieve," Justin Upton said. "If everybody can contribute every day, I think we'll be fine."	Atlanta added three more runs in the second.	Tyler Pastornicky led off with a triple and scored on Heyward's RBI double. Freeman followed with his fourth homer to give the Braves a 6-0 lead.	Washington's first run came on Jose Lobaton's RBI groundout, scoring Kevin Frandsen from third to make it 6-1 in the fifth.	Freeman, who has hit .470 in his last 34 at-bats, avoided a scare in the fourth when Gonzalez's 92 mph fastball hit the outer right side of his right hand. Like the rest of the day, everything seemed to go Atlanta's way.	"It pinched my pinkie into the bat," Freeman said. "It was more a scare than an injury. I got really lucky. I think if I didn't choke up, I'm done. By choking up, it got some fat right there. I kind of lucked out, I think."	Game notes	Washington RF Jayson Werth returned after a sore groin forced him from the lineup on Saturday. Werth went 0 for 4 with two strikeouts and stranded three runners. ... Simmons hit in the No. 5 spot for the first time in his career, going 2 for 5 with three RBIs. ... Nate McLouth was supposed to start in CF and bat second for Washington, but manager Matt Williams said he tweaked his left knee while shagging flyballs during batting practice and was held out. ... Nationals LF Steven Souza Jr. made his major league debut in the seventh as Frandsen moved to second base and Danny Espinosa left the game. Souza struck out in the eighth. ... The Nationals called up INF Zach Walters from Triple-A Syracuse to take Zimmerman's spot on the 25-man roster. Walters struck out as a pinch-hitter to end the game. ... Span, on the seven-day DL with concussion symptoms, missed his second straight game.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PHILADELPHIA --  Chase Utley is feeling healthy and his bat certainly isn't hurting, either.	Utley extended his hot start with the tiebreaking homer among three hits, sparking the Philadelphia Phillies to a 4-3 victory over the Miami Marlins on Sunday for a three-game sweep.	Utley raised his average to .500 through 10 games, with six doubles, three home runs and 10 RBIs. The five-time All-Star, who missed two games with the flu, has a hit in each of his games this season.	Knee issues the last few seasons knocked Utley off an All-Star pace, but he's playing now as if those problems are behind him.	"I just see him in really good shape, moving really well on the field defensively and running the bases," Philadelphia manager Ryne Sandberg said. "He's staying so active on the bases. Maybe that shows how well he's feeling. That's (knee problems) a non-issue and he's having quality at-bats and seeing the ball well. He's just in a real good zone. Even his outs are hard."	Utley, notorious for keeping things close to the vest, said he's feeling no better or worse physically.	"I've had some decent days, feel OK," he said. "I feel fine, like I normally do."	Will Nieves had three hits and two RBIs for Philadelphia, which has won 13 of its last 16 games against Miami.	Garrett Jones homered and Casey McGehee had two hits and an RBI for the Marlins, who lost their seventh straight. The Marlins return home to face the Nationals on Monday after getting swept on the six-game road trip through Washington and Philadelphia.	"Everyone has to take ownership for this trip," Miami manager Mike Redmond said. "We've got to get better. There are areas we have to improve on, but we're still battling. Nobody's going to give up."	Utley broke a 3-all tie with two outs in the eighth by driving a 1-0 offering from Mike Dunn (0-1) into the seats in right-center.	"Just finding some holes," Utley said. "Not trying to do too much. Trying to put the ball in play and right now they're falling."	A.J. Bastardo (1-1) pitched a scoreless eighth for the win.	Jonathan Papelbon pitched a scoreless ninth for his third save in four chances.	Kyle Kendrick has a sparkling career record against the Marlins, going 12-2 with a 3.48 ERA in 21 career games coming in. In his last 11, he was 9-0 with a 2.21 ERA. But he did not factor into the decision Sunday after giving up three runs -- two earned -- on six hits in six innings.	His counterpart, Henderson Alvarez, yielded three runs and 12 hits in six innings.	The Marlins took advantage of first baseman Ryan Howard's fielding error to get a run in the first on McGehee's RBI single and tacked on a run on in the second on Christian Yelich's run-scoring single.	Jones launched his first homer of the season to deep right with one out in the fifth to give Miami a 3-1 lead.	Philadelphia tied it in the bottom half on Nieves' two-out, two-run double to right.	The Phillies requested an out call at home plate be reviewed in the seventh inning.	Tony Gwynn Jr. was called out trying to score from first on Utley's double to left. But Sandberg asked for the play to be reviewed because he thought catcher Jeff Mathis was blocking the plate with his left leg prior to Gwynn's slide.	Under the expanded replay format, umpires initiate a review of the new rule covering collisions at home plate. After a 54-second delay the out call by homeplate umpire Mark Ripperger was upheld.	Sandberg, though, believes there needs to be clarification to the rule.	"I thought the catcher did not give the base runner a lane," he said. "I saw the replay and I still say the leg was blocking it, so Gwynn didn't have a lane to home plate. I felt like Gwynn had to alter his slide because the plate was blocked, so there's some confusion there."	Howard had just three hits in his last 17 at-bats before homering to the opposite field with one out in the third to tie it at 1. It was the second homer of the season for Howard.	Gwynn started in center field in place of Ben Revere for the third straight game and had three hits. Revere struck out swinging in the seventh as a pinch-hitter.	The Phillies, who entered leading the NL with 43 bases on balls, walked six times against three Marlins pitchers.	Game notes	 Hall of Fame third baseman Mike Schmidt debuted in the Phillies broadcast booth during the game. Schmidt will serve as a color analyst on Sunday home games this season. ... Prior to the game, the Phillies optioned RHP Justin De Fratus to Triple-A Lehigh Valley and recalled RHP Luis Garcia. De Fratus allowed four runs in five innings (7.20 ERA) over four games this season. ... Phillies RHP Roberto Hernandez (1-0, 4.35) opposes Atlanta RHP Ervin Santana (1-0, 0.00) when the teams open a four-game series in Philadelphia at 7:05 p.m. Monday. ... Marlins LHP Brad Hand (0-0, 3.24) faces RHP Jordan Zimmerman (0-0, 8.10) Monday. ... Philadelphia 3B Cody Asche went 0 for 2 and is hitless in 10 at-bats.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

CHICAGO -- Alexei Ramirez came up to the plate, ready to swing.	Ramirez hit a two-run homer on the first pitch he saw from John Axford in the ninth inning, rallying the Chicago White Sox over the Cleveland Indians 4-3 on a rainy Sunday.	"Everybody knows me as an aggressive hitter," Ramirez said through a translator. "I'm going to go looking for a good pitch to hit and when I get it, I'm going to swing at it. And that's what happened, I got a good pitch."	"(Axford is) definitely a really good pitcher and he just left me a pitch up there and I was able to put a good swing on it," he said.	Ramirez has a hit in all 13 games for the White Sox this season.	The Indians scored twice in the top of the ninth, getting the go-ahead run on a wild pitch by closer Matt Lindstrom.	Axford (0-1) came in seeking his fifth save in as many chances. He issued a leadoff walk to Jordan Danks, who stole second.	One out later, Ramirez homered over the left field fence.	The White Sox won a series against Cleveland for the first time since October 2012. Chicago took three of four in this set.	The game was delayed 1 hour, 15 minutes at the start by the threat of rain. There was another 45-minute delay in the fourth.	Cleveland trailed 2-1 going into the ninth. Michael Brantley reached on first base Jose Abreu's error, and singles by Yan Gomes and David Murphy tied it.	"Try to have a solid at-bat. There's a lot of things you can do to be productive right there, at least get that runner at second to third," Murphy said.	With two outs, Lindstrom (1-1) threw a wild pitch that put the Indians ahead.	Marcus Semien hit a solo home run in the eighth to give Chicago a 2-1 lead. He sent a full-count pitch from Indians starter Corey Kluber into the seats in right field.	Brantley gave Cleveland a 1-0 lead with two outs in the fourth when he homered off Jose Quintana.	The White Sox tied the game in the bottom half after the rain delay. With runners on second and third, Dayan Viciedo drove in a run with an infield single.	Quintana gave up one run and five hits over six innings. He struck out six and walked two while throwing a career-high 121 pitches.	"When he goes out there he always gives us a chance to win," manager Robin Ventura said. "That's the one thing about Q, very rarely is he out there in his game and he doesn't give you a chance to win."	Game notes	Ventura says OF Avisail Garcia will have season-ending shoulder surgery on Tuesday. He was injured Wednesday at Colorado on a diving-catch attempt. . Chicago 2B Gordon Beckham (strained left oblique) was cleared to resume his rehab assignment with Double-A Birmingham. ... Chicago is off Monday before concluding its seven-game homestand with three games against the Boston Red Sox beginning Tuesday. Rookie Erik Johnson (0-1, 9.58 ERA) is scheduled to face former White Sox righty Jake Peavy (0-0, 2.13 ERA) in the opener. ... The Indians reinstated 3B Lonnie Chisenhall from the paternity list and optioned Justin Sellers back to Triple-A Columbus. Chisenhall's second son, Cannon, was born Thursday. ... Cleveland is off Monday before beginning a three-game series at Detroit on Tuesday with right-hander Zach McAllister (1-0, 2.31 ERA) scheduled to face Anibal Sanchez (0-0, 3.00 ERA).	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

MILWAUKEE -- Kyle Lohse was eager to top his Milwaukee teammates.	He sure came close.	Lohse came within an out of a complete game, and the Brewers won their ninth straight with a 4-1 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Sunday.	"We talked about it and it is a friendly competition to see what the guy in front of you did and do it better," he said of the Brewers' rotation.	At 10-2, the Brewers are off to their best start since going 13-0 to open the 1987 season. This is Milwaukee's longest winning streak since a nine-game string last April.	Lohse (2-1) gave up four hits and struck out nine in 8 2/3 innings. He fanned five straight in the seventh and eighth innings.	Lohse retired 12 of his last 13 batters. He was pulled with two outs in the ninth after giving up a single to Andrew McCutchen.	Will Smith struck out Pedro Alvarez on three pitches to record his first career save.	Milwaukee's rotation has been outstanding. The starters have a combined 1.80 ERA over the first 12 games, giving up just 22 earned runs.	Lohse said he was disappointed to be pulled one out from a complete game, but understand the decision by manager Ron Roenicke.	"It is tough, but I understand," he said. "I've been around long enough to know that we need to win that game and keep the momentum going. I wanted to finish it, but I know that if I wanted to I needed to get that guy (McCuthchen) out."	Roenicke said he pulled Lohse because he was at 100 pitches.	"Sometimes the decisions aren't very popular, but they're decisions as a manager you need to make," Roenicke said. "I thought Kyle pitched a great game. When you get to 100 pitches, that starts to put pressure on a pitcher and we've got a long season to go."	Lohse had some fine defense behind him as shortstop Jean Segura made several tough plays and outfielder Logan Shafer robbed Alvarez of at least a double in the second inning when he hauled in Alvarez's long drive just before crashing into the left field wall.	"That was huge because normally that is a double and then I have some work to do," Lohse said.	The Brewers broke open the game in the sixth, helped by an error. Aramis Ramirez walked and moved to third on Lyle Overbay's double, just his second hit of the season.	Morton struck out Scooter Gennett, but the ball was in the dirt. Catcher Tony Sanchez's throw to first was wide and went down the right field line, allowing Ramirez and Overbay to score.	Roenicke said the play was an example of all the breaks the Brewers are getting right now because the team is playing well.	"I think anytime you play good baseball and are doing things right, you seem to get more breaks," he said. "They make that play and we have to come up with big hits in other places."	Charlie Morton (0-1) pitched seven innings as the Pirates lost for the fourth time in five games.	"It would have been a much closer game if I didn't butcher that play," Sanchez said. "I take a lot of pride in my defense and I take a lot of pride in getting my pitchers through as many innings as possible. That score does not reflect Charlie's performance today."	Martin Maldonado got the first hit of the game as he lined a double off the right field wall leading off the Milwaukee third. Lohse sacrificed and Carlos Gomez hit a sacrifice fly.	The Pirates tied the game in the fourth. Starling Marte led off with a single, moved to third on a perfect hit-and-run single by Jose Tabata and scored on McCutchen's sacrifice fly, just beating the throw from Gomez in center.	Ryan Braun doubled in the Milwaukee fourth and scored on a single by Ramirez, who has 11 RBIs.	Game notes	The Brewers will try for their 10th straight win Monday night when they host St. Louis. Matt Garza starts against the Cardinals' Lance Lynn. ... The Pirates move on to Cincinnati, where Wandy Rodriquez will face Homer Bailey of the Reds. ... The Brewers and the Pirates will meet again in a four-game series in Pittsburgh starting Thursday.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Needing a big hit, the Minnesota Twins instead turned a little tapper back to the mound into big trouble for the Kansas City Royals.	Pitcher Wade Davis made a wild flip home on a comebacker in the eighth inning and the Twins rallied past the Royals 4-3 Sunday for a three-game sweep.	"Had the play right there in front of me, just didn't make it," Davis said.	A madcap sequence put the Twins ahead and a crazy play ended it, too.	With two outs and none on in the ninth, Mike Moustakas popped a ball straight up. As he stood to watch it in the batter's box, catcher Kurt Suzuki tripped over him, resulting in an interference call for the final out.	"That's always on the hitter," Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said. "That's not going to be on the defender. He has a right to catch the ball."	After the Royals scored three times in the eighth for a 3-2 lead, reliever Aaron Crow (0-1) walked two Minnesota batters to start the bottom half.	Davis struck out Joe Mauer, but Trevor Plouffe walked to load the bases. Chris Herrmann then hit a grounder back to the mound and Davis, hoping to begin an easy double play, hesitated briefly after getting the ball out of his glove.	Davis' toss sailed past catcher Salvador Perez. Pedro Florimon scored the tying run and Dozier slid home under Perez's return throw to Davis, who was a step late covering the plate.	"You got to be aggressive, you can't lose that," Dozier said. "I saw the throw. I saw Davis just hanging out a good 10 yards away from the thing, so might as well take a shot."	The lapse by Davis compounded an already frustrating series for the Royals. Kansas City was outscored 21-5 in the sweep.	"I got frustrated and made a mental mistake by not being there," Davis said. "It's unacceptable."	Casey Fien (1-0) got one out and Glen Perkins posted his third save.	The Royals have lost their first five road games this season, managing just nine runs.	"I think everybody's trying to do too much right now," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "When you go in a slump everybody tries to do more, and that's only natural for a team when you're having trouble scoring runs."	Josmil Pinto hit his third homer in the seventh inning to give the Twins a 2-0 lead.	Twins starter Kevin Correia cruised through seven innings before running into trouble in the eighth. He allowed three runs on six hits in seven innings.	Eric Hosmer's RBI double capped the Royals' three-run eighth.	Not wearing sleeves despite a gametime temperature of 42 degrees, Jason Vargas held the Twins to two runs on five hits over seven innings for his third straight quality start this season.	That type of outing would have been more than enough last season, when the Royals won 15 of 19 from Minnesota. But the Twins now have the upper hand to start 2014.	Game notes	 The Twins swept the Royals for the first time since winning four in a row in June 2011. ... A CT scan revealed a small fracture in LF Josh Willingham's hand. Twins assistant GM Rob Antony said the team will consult hand specialists, but remains hopeful that Willingham won't need more than 15 days on the disabled list. ... Gardenhire returned after missing the previous two games to attend a funeral. ... Both teams are off on Monday. When the Royals begin a three-game series in Houston on Tuesday, hard-throwing Dominican rookie Yordano Ventura will make his second start against RHP Lucas Harrell (0-2, 11.05). ... The Twins begin a three-game series at Target Field with Toronto on Tuesday. RHP Phil Hughes will look for his first win in a Twins uniform against RHP Brandon Morrow (1-1, 5.73).	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ST. LOUIS -- Michael Wacha doesn't mind a little bad weather.	Wacha had to wait out yet another lengthy rain delay, Matt Carpenter drove in three runs and the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Chicago Cubs 6-4 Sunday.	St. Louis took two of three from the Cubs and has won four of six. Chicago has lost three of four.	Rain has figured in all three of Wacha's starts this season. He actually seemed to embrace a third-inning downpour that halted play against the Cubs for 46 minutes.	"I'm used to it," he said. "You just have to accept it and you've got to stay focused. I tried to stay loose and just keep my mind in what I needed to do."	Wacha's first start of the season was delayed before first pitch by 2 hours, 40 minutes. He endured a short 12-minute delay at the outset of his second outing.	Wacha (2-0) allowed three runs and five hits in 6 1/3 innings Sunday. He gave up a two-run homer to Anthony Rizzo on the 16th pitch of the game, but yielded just one run on three hits the rest of the way. He struck out eight and walked one.	"At the start, I was a little erratic, but I was able to settle down a little bit," he said. "I got some quick innings and some quick outs."	St. Louis manager Mike Matheny says Wacha has the mental makeup to handle lengthy or short delays.	"He's strong and he knows what to do out there," Matheny said. "He keeps a good focus. I felt like his curveball was a lot better after the delay."	Carpenter hit a two-run single in the second inning and added a sacrifice fly in the fourth that put St. Louis ahead to stay at 4-3. He is tied with Yadier Molina for the team lead with nine RBI.	"It felt good to get the job done," Carpenter said. "When you get up in those situations, you just try and put a good at-bat up there and I thought I did that."	Trevor Rosenthal gave up a run in the ninth, but retired Luis Valbuena and Emilio Bonifacio with the tying runs on base to pick up his fourth save in four opportunities.	Chicago starter Edwin Jackson (0-1) allowed four runs and eight hits in six innings. He struck out five and walked three in a grueling 114-pitch effort.	"I didn't feel too bad," Jackson said. "I threw a lot of pitches. I was behind in a lot of counts. They were aggressive, that's a good hitting team."	Jhonny Peralta highlighted a two-run eighth with an RBI double that put St. Louis up 6-3.	Rizzo got his club started with his second homer of the season.	"I just got extended," Rizzo said. "I was lucky enough to get the barrel on it."	After Carpenter singled in two runs in the second, he stole second and scored on Kolten Wong's single for a 3-2 lead.	The Cubs tied the game in the fourth on a run-scoring single by Welington Castillo.	Carpenter then gave St. Louis the lead for good with a sacrifice fly to left that brought in Peter Bourjos, who began the fourth inning with a triple.	"We did the things we had to at the right times to win," Carpenter said.	Trailing 4-3, Mike Olt led off the Cubs seventh with a double off Wacha. Castillo struck out and reliever Kevin Siegrist retired Darwin Barney and Bonifacio to end the threat.	Siegrist retired all five batters he faced.	"We had some chances, just couldn't get hits at the right time," Rizzo said.	Game notes	The Cubs are winless in their last nine series. Their last series win came in September when they won two of three in Cincinnati. .... St. Louis begins a 10-game road trip Monday with the first of a three-game set in Milwaukee. Lance Lynn (2-0, 6.55 ERA) takes on Matt Garza (0-1, 2.57) in the opener. ... The Cubs conclude a five-game road trip with two games against the New York Yankees. Jason Hammel (2-0, 2.63) faces Masahiro Tanaka (1-0, 3.21) in the first game on Tuesday. .... St. Louis C Yadier Molina has 11 hits in his last 22 at-bats, including two hits on Sunday.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- Martin Perez kept his pitches low in the zone and got plenty of help from the Texas defense.	Perez threw eight scoreless innings with the benefit of four double-play grounders, plus two runners thrown out trying to steal a base, and the Rangers got a series-clinching 1-0 victory over the Houston Astros on Sunday.	"That happens when you throw all your pitches down and you get a lot of groundballs," Perez said. "If you can throw strikes with runners on base, you can get a win, you can get the outs. You have to make a pitch and trust your stuff."	The lone run came on a sacrifice fly in the sixth by Donnie Murphy, who was in the game only because shortstop Elvis Andrus got ejected at the end of the third after taking a called third strike. Andrus tossed his bat away from the plate and then said something to home plate umpire Alan Porter.	"As soon as I saw (the ump) point at him, I automatically threw off the hoodie and got loose, so I didn't really have much time to think about it," said Murphy, who joined the Rangers at the end of spring training. "It's always nice when you don't start the game just to come in and contribute like that."	Perez (2-0) struck out two while scattering five hits and three walks. Catcher Robinson Chirinos threw out would-be base stealers in the third and fifth innings.	Alexi Ogando worked a perfect ninth to convert his first save chance.	Murphy's deep flyball to the left-center gap in the sixth sent home Josh Wilson against Brett Oberholtzer (0-3), who had a career-high seven strikeouts with no walks.	"Oberholtzer was outstanding. Our starters did a tremendous job this whole series. The starts put us in a position to win every game," Astros manager Bo Porter said. "We've got to get (the offense) going. If you don't score, you've got zero chance of winning."	The Astros, who have scored only four runs in Oberholtzer's three starts, scored in only two of their 31 innings against Texas. They had a five-run fourth inning Saturday before the game-winning run in the 10th.	It was only the 10th 1-0 victory for the Rangers in their 1,601 regular-season home games since moving into their current ballpark 20 years ago. It was their second in three games against the Astros, the first time Texas has ever had multiple 1-0 wins in the same series -- home or away.	Texas won the series opener 1-0 in 12 innings Friday night after Yu Darvish was perfect thru five innings. The Astros won 6-5 in 10 innings Saturday to snap their 12-game losing streak to their instate AL West rival.	Houston has scored only four runs in the three games started this season by Oberholtzer, who struck out a career-high seven in seven innings against Texas.	Texas has won its last 15 series against the Astros since dropping two of three at Houston in June 2008.	Andrus struck out in both of his at-bats, ending his season-opening 11-game hitting streak that was second-longest in team history. Al Oliver had hits in the Rangers' first 13 games to start the 1979 season.	Prince Fielder finished 0 for 3, dropping his average to .149 through his first 12 games with the Rangers. The Astros used a drastic shift against him this weekend that took away several hits, including a sharp liner caught by second baseman Jose Altuve in shallow right to end the sixth Sunday. Altuve fielded a ground near that spot in the fourth.	Game notes	It took only 44 seconds in the first inning for replay to overturn first base umpire Joe West's call that Shin-Soo Choo was safe at first base.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Albert Pujols and the Los Angeles Angels caught up with Bartolo Colon on Sunday.	Mike Trout, Pujols and Raul Ibanez hit consecutive home runs off Colon in the first inning and the Angels routed the New York Mets 14-2.	"Anytime you can hit three home runs in a row, that's pretty special. I've been through that before in my career," Pujols said. "Everybody knows what Bartolo is going to do -- 95 percent of his pitches are fastballs and he pounds the strike zone."	Hank Conger also went deep against Colon, who won the AL Cy Young Award in 2005 with the Angels. Over the previous four seasons, he was 6-1 with a 1.75 ERA in nine starts against the Angels.	"He's had our number, but today wasn't his day," Pujols said. "He's a guy who's aggressive in the strike zone and we executed our game plan pretty well. If you look at last year, it seemed like every time we faced him he pretty much pitched seven or eight strong innings. So we wanted to get the jump on him early."	The Angels also hit a pair of doubles in the first inning against Colon (1-2).	Colon gave up nine runs and 11 hits in five innings, allowing at least one hit to every batter in the Angels' starting lineup after pitching seven scoreless innings last Tuesday night in Atlanta.	"At that moment, you're not thinking: `Why is this happening?' It's just part of the game," Colon said through a translator. "Everything felt all right. They just felt a little bit better than me."	The four homers and nine earned runs against the 40-year-old Colon equaled a career worst in both categories.	"Even though Bartolo's had our number, it seems like all the runs we scored off him today were the ones we've needed the last two years off of him," Angels pitcher C.J. Wilson said. "He's absolutely dominated us, and today was a complete aberration. I've never seen him get hit like that before in person."	Wilson (2-1) allowed two runs and six hits in seven innings, striking out nine and walking three.	Mets third baseman David Wright and second baseman Daniel Murphy were ejected in the top of the seventh by plate umpire Toby Basner.	Wright and Murphy were called out on strikes earlier in the game. Both took exception after Basner called out Travis d'Arnaud at-bat.	It was the fourth career ejection for Wright and the first for Murphy.	"I'm not going to comment on the umpires. I'm not going to get into any more trouble than I'm already in. I've said my peace down on the field and I'm just going to leave it at that," Wright said.	"We have each others' backs. And when something happens to one of us, it happens to all of us. There were some disagreements. It's frustrating," he said.	Wilson got seven of his strikeouts on called strikes.	"You can't really get a scouting report on the umpires and try to change too much with that. You have to pitch to the hitters," Wilson said. "But it wasn't like the guy had some crazy strike zone. It's just that they were up there looking for pitches that I wasn't throwing, which is why they took the strike three calls."	During the singing "God Bless America" in the seventh-inning stretch, Mets manager Terry Collins stood next to Basner at home plate. The two could be seen chatting.	The Angels came out swinging and got all three of their homers in a span of seven pitches. Trout drove his fourth of the season into the center field trees with one out and Pujols hit his third into the left field bullpen.	Ibanez, who hit a tying, three-run shot off closer Jose Valverde in the ninth inning Saturday night for his 2,000th career hit, connected against Colon before the Angels added another run on doubles by Kole Calhoun and Ian Stewart.	Stewart later homered.	Game notes	The Angels hit three straight homers for the first time since July 27, 2009, when Juan Rivera, Kendrys Morales and Mike Napoli did it. ... Colon was the first Mets pitcher to yield three in a row since June 8, 2012, at Yankee Stadium, when Robinson Cano, Nick Swisher and Andruw Jones connected against Johan Santana.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Brandon Crawford's first splash hit came at a most opportune time.	Crawford led off the 10th inning with a game-ending drive into McCovey Cove to give the San Francisco Giants a 5-4 victory over the Colorado Rockies on Sunday.	"It feels good," he said. "I wanted to hit one in there for a long time. I'm glad I finally got to."	Pablo Sandoval also homered and Angel Pagan drove in two runs for the Giants, who bounced back from a 1-0 loss on Saturday to take two of three in the series.	Crawford turned on the second pitch thrown by Rex Brothers (1-1) and drove it into the water on the fly for his first career walkoff homer and first splash homer.	"He smoked that one," manager Bruce Bochy said. "I asked him if he ever hit one further."	The homer also helped Crawford show Bochy that he deserves more at-bats against left-handed pitchers. Bochy said earlier this season that Crawford might sit against certain lefties after hitting just .199 off them last season.	But he is 7 for 14 so far this year against lefties with no bigger hit than the one against Brothers.	"That's what you want these guys to do is take anything that you may throw at them that may not have them in the game as a challenge," Bochy said. "To his credit, he's done that."	Sergio Romo (1-0) pitched a scoreless 10th for the win.	Wilin Rosario and Justin Morneau hit solo homers for the Rockies, who have lost 15 of their last 18 games in San Francisco and have not won a series here since 2010.	But the Rockies got bad news after the game when they learned lefty Brett Anderson broke the index finger on his throwing hand Saturday and is expected to miss four to six weeks.	"We have to play the hand we're dealt with here," manager Walt Weiss said. "His arm is great and so is everything else. It's better than having arm trouble."	The Giants nearly won it in the ninth, when Gregor Blanco hit a drive off the wall in right field with two outs and nobody on. When Michael Cuddyer misplayed the carom off the wall, Blanco tried to score on the play but was thrown out on a relay from second baseman D.J. LeMahieu to Rosario.	The play was eerily similar to one last year when Pagan shocked the Rockies with a game-ending, two-run, inside-the-park homer in the 10th inning of a 6-5 win May 25.	"I saw it develop and thought this can't happen to you two years in a row," Weiss said. "But Cuddy kept his cool, gave D.J. a good throw and then D.J. then made good throw to home."	Tim Hudson appeared to be cruising to this third straight win to open his San Francisco career, taking a 4-2 lead into the eighth inning having thrown only 77 pitches.	But then Nolan Arenado and LeMahieu opened with doubles to cut the Giants lead to 4-3. Pinch-hitter Drew Stubbs tied it with a one-out single off Javier Lopez.	"I would have been sick if we had lost this game because I felt like I had a pretty good game and then in the eighth inning we were tied up," Hudson said.	Hudson allowed four runs and five hits in 7 1/3 innings. He hasn't walked a batter in 23 innings, setting a San Francisco record for most consecutive innings without a walk to open the season.	The Giants had given Hudson the lead when they broke a 17-inning scoreless streak by scoring three runs in the fifth inning against Tyler Chatwood with a sacrifice fly by Crawford and two-run single from Pagan.	Sandoval added a leadoff homer in the sixth.	Game notes	Atlee Hammaker opened the 1983 season with 21 straight innings without a walk for the Giants. ... The Giants open a three-game home series Tuesday against the Dodgers with Tim Lincecum (0-1) facing Josh Beckett (0-0). ... The Rockies open a four-game series in San Diego on Monday with Jordan Lyles (2-0) taking on Eric Stults (0-2).	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SEATTLE --  Another well-pitched game for the Oakland Athletics came with a price.	Scott Kazmir threw six sharp innings before leaving with tightness in his left triceps, and Yoenis Cespedes hit a two-run homer that broke a scoreless tie in the eighth that lifted the A's over the Seattle Mariners 3-0 Sunday.	Kazmir called it was "a very, very minor" injury. He said it won't cause him to miss a start, but the A's have reason to be cautionary.	This spring the club lost staff ace Jarrod Parker to season-ending elbow surgery and A.J. Griffin is sidelined for perhaps the first two months with a strained forearm.	Oakland's staff has an AL-leading 2.17 ERA.	"It's exciting to have guys follow up a quality start, one after another, one through five. It really is exciting," Kazmir said. "We just want to keep going out there and keep making quality pitches and quality outings, all of us."	Kazmir pitched two-hit ball, striking out nine without a walk.	A's manager Melvin said that the first time he noticed Kazmir was affected by the tightness was at the end of the sixth. Kazmir had a similar issue during training camp, missing one start with triceps tightness.	"Everything checked out as far as his strengthening and what he does after a game," Melvin said. "He wanted to go back out but you have to be careful with a guy like that."	Mariners star Robinson Cano said Kazmir was exceptionally tough.	"He was making guys chase his slider and throwing the heater at 95," Cano said.	Cespedes pulled a 2-2 slider from Charlie Furbush (0-1) into the left-field bullpen. Cespedes' second homer of the season came after Jed Lowrie drew a leadoff walk.	Josh Donaldson added a solo home run in the ninth, his third, off Lucas Luetge.	Dan Otero (2-0) retired two batters in the seventh. Luke Gregerson worked the eighth and Sean Doolittle allowed one hit in the ninth for his first save.	Chris Young made his first start since Sept. 9, 2012, while with the New York Mets. Troubled by shoulder problems all last season, he went to spring camp this year with the Nationals, was released and signed during the last week of training camp by Seattle.	Young pitched six shutout innings, giving up four hits. He walked three and struck out two.	Young's other outing for Seattle was a two-inning scoreless stint in relief.	"I was really, really pleased with his outing," Mariners manager Lloyd McClendon said. "He got a lot of flyball outs, teased them up in the zone a bit. I think he is close. I saw his breaking ball coming today. When that pitch comes for him, he's going to be pretty tough."	Kazmir didn't allow a runner and struck out six the first time through the lineup. The Mariners got back-to-back, one-out singles by Brad Miller and Cano in the fourth, but Kazmir retired Corey Hart on a grounder and struck out Justin Smoak with a 78 mph changeup.	The Mariners' only other scoring threat came with two outs in the sixth when Brad Miller sent right fielder Eric Sogard to the wall to bring down his flyball.	Cano, who singled in the fourth, has a 14-game hitting streak against Oakland dating to Sept. 22, 2012.	Game notes	 Seattle manager Lloyd McClendon isn't sure about Major League Baseball's expanded replay format. "I'm really worried about where we're heading with replays, the effect it's having on the game, the effect it's having on the fans," McClendon said. "It's confusing." McClendon is concerned about the outfield transfer rule, when umpires look to be sure fielders successfully switch the ball from the glove to their hands. The Mariners already have had three such plays this season, with mixed results. "It was made for the play at second, on the double-play ball," Melvin said. "I don't think anyone thought it would come into play in the outfield as you're seeing right now." Both managers have had to talk to their players to be certain that runners go against their instincts and watch the umpires, not the play, in order to advance or hold. "I think the players are struggling more than the managers," McClendon said. "Initially, I thought I'd be a fan of it. But I'm not so sure now." ... Mariners top pitching prospect Taijuan Walker (shoulder) is scheduled to make another rehab start Tuesday in the minors. Seattle has an open spot in the rotation for that day, but McClendon said he doesn't know when Walker will be called up.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

SAN DIEGO -- A handful of San Diego regulars still aren't hitting their weight, and the Padres had only six hits against Max Scherzer and the Detroit Tigers on Sunday.	That would normally have the Padres heading for a loss, especially at Petco Park.	Thanks, though, to big right-hander Tyson Ross and some timely hitting, the Padres beat the Tigers 5-1 to take two of three for their first series win this season.	Ross outdueled Scherzer, the reigning AL Cy Young Award winner, and Jedd Gyorko and Xavier Nady homered.	"It was a big day for us," said Will Venable, who hit a two-run double after Scherzer walked two batters to open the fourth. "Not necessarily because of the Tigers, but because we got the series win."	The Padres had lost two of three in each of their first three series.	So taking two of three from the Tigers "means a lot, obviously," Nady said.	"That's an unbelievable organization and an unbelievable team. When you're struggling and you can take two out of three against a team like that, it shows what's in this ballclub, and the fight. We obviously didn't come out of the gate playing well. The pitching has done a tremendous job and now it's our turn on the offensive side to get some guys going and hopefully get some runs early and get big hits and start playing well," he said.	After two shaky opening starts, Ross (1-2) struck out seven and held the Tigers to one run and six hits in seven innings. He walked one.	Ross said he made an adjustment in his delivery since his last start. He even had an RBI single against Scherzer.	But he didn't take it as a bigger challenge than normal.	"The only one I really had was worrying about hitting against him," Ross said. "I've seen him on TV and knew he was going to be a tough one live. Other than that I'm facing the Tigers, not necessarily just Max."	Scherzer (0-1) allowed four runs and four hits in five innings, struck out 10 and walked three. The Tigers have scored three runs for Scherzer in his three starts.	He called his day's work "Inefficient. I just didn't feel like I was efficient out there but I've got to give them credit. I'm not going to ignore what they did. They battled me and they made me work. I also felt like I didn't consistently pound the strike zone the way I'm accustomed to. I fell behind too many guys. I let them get too many hitters counts for them to capitalize on."	The Tigers have lost four of six under rookie manager Brad Ausmus, who was working in the Padres' front office when Detroit hired him in November.	Gyorko homered to left on a 3-1 fastball from Scherzer leading off the second, his first.	"It was good to get into a hitter's count," said Gyorko, who also made some nice plays at second base. "It was good to get us started. Especially the way Tyson was throwing, we knew we didn't need to get many. Just try to get that first run on the board and let him kind of go to work."	Gyorko and Venable are hitting just .163 while Chase Headley is hitting .186.	"Hopefully it's the start of something. It just takes one swing to kind of get you started sometimes," Gyorko said. "Our at-bats as a team have gotten better as the season has gone on, so hopefully we can keep it going."	The Tigers tied it in the fourth, when Torii Hunter hit a leadoff double and scored on Victor Martinez's one-out single.	Scherzer faltered by walking Chase Headley and Yonder Alonso to open the fourth and the Padres jumped on him for a 4-1 lead. Venable doubled down the right-field line to bring in Headley and Alonso, and Ross singled to left to bring in Venable.	"Leadoff walks kill you," Scherzer said, `'especially if you do it twice. That's a recipe for disaster. That was the difference in the game. I have to attack the zone early in the count."	Nady, 35, hit an opposite-field pinch homer off Ian Krol an estimated 422 feet into the sandy play area beyond the fence in right-center leading off the seventh. Dating to 2012, his last three big league hits have been home runs. He homered Tuesday at Cleveland. Before that, his last homer was on Sept. 30, 2012, while with San Francisco, at Petco Park against Padres closer Huston Street.	Game notes	It was Nady's seventh career pinch homer. ... Padres manager Bud Black said there's a "probability" LF Carlos Quentin will take batting practice on the field before Monday's game against Colorado. Quentin opened the season on the disabled list with a bone bruise in his left knee. ... The Tigers are off Monday before opening a homestand Tuesday night, with RHP Anibal Sanchez (0-0, 3.00) scheduled to start against Zach McAllister (1-0, 2.31) of the Indians. The Padres continue their 10-game homestand with the opener of a four-game series against Colorado. LHP Eric Stults (0-2, 5.59) is scheduled to start against RHP Jordan Lyles (2-0, 3.86).	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

PHOENIX -- That dry desert air brought out the best of the Los Angeles Dodgers offense, especially Adrian Gonzalez.	Gonzalez homered for the fourth consecutive game and the Dodgers beat the Diamondbacks 8-6 on Sunday to complete a three-game sweep.	Gonzalez's three-run shot off Trevor Cahill (0-4) in the third inning gave him 10 RBIs in the series. He has 27 career home runs and 87 RBIs against the Diamondbacks, most among active players.	"Man, he's smoking the ball," teammate Matt Kemp said. "He's probably the best hitter in the league right now."	Kemp and Juan Uribe also homered for the Dodgers, who scored 22 runs in the series.	"This is a good place to hit," Gonzalez said. "You go out here and take BP (batting practice) and the ball carries out of the ballpark. You take some of those swings and it kind of makes you feel better as a hitter."	Dan Haren (2-0) allowed three runs in 5 2/3 innings to get the victory.	Mark Trumbo hit a three-run home run and Eric Chavez had a solo shot for the Diamondbacks, who are off to a 4-11 start.	Dee Gordon stole a career-best four bases, the most by a Dodger in a game since Rafael Furcal did it against Arizona in 2007.	"He's always been able to do that," Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said, "but now he's getting on base a lot. He's walking and he's getting his hits. That's what really changes the dynamic."	Cahill failed to make it through the fifth inning for the third time in his four starts.	He went four innings plus two batters, allowing seven runs -- six earned -- on seven hits. Cahill struck out eight but walked five.	Asked why Cahill can be good for a stretch then fall apart, Arizona manager Kirk Gibson said, "I think you'd have to ask Trevor that. I don't have an answer for you."	Cahill said the walks were a big problem, and that one pitch to Gonzalez.	"I made a mistake and Adrian's been swinging it good this series," Cahill said. "I kind of got away from the game plan with him and left a pitch down and in, right in his sweet spot."	Haren scattered nine hits, striking out five and walking one.	Kenley Jansen pitched a perfect ninth for his fourth save and second in as many games.	The Dodgers led 8-3 before Trumbo's sixth home run of the season, off Jamey Wright with two outs in the seventh, cut it to 8-6.	Gonzalez, who also doubled, had an extra-base hit for the eighth consecutive game, one shy of the franchise record. Ten of Gonzalez's 14 hits this season have gone for extra bases.	Kemp's line shot into the Arizona bullpen down the left field line put the Dodgers up 1-0 in the second.	Gordon walked to start the fourth, then stole second and third. Yasiel Puig walked and Hanley Ramirez bounced one high off the plate to Cahill, beating the throw to first for an infield RBI single. Gonzalez hit a 1-1 pitch into the right field seats to bring in three runs and Los Angeles led 5-0.	Arizona got three in its half of the third. Parra led off with a double and scored on Aaron Hill's triple to the left-center gap. Goldschmidt's groundout scored Hill, then Chavez skied one to the right field seats on the first pitch to cut the lead to 5-3.	In the fifth, Cahill walked Ramirez, then Gonzalez lashed a double to right and the Arizona right-hander's day was over. Randall Delgado, who just lost his spot in the rotation, came on in relief. Gonzalez scored on Andre Ethier's groundout, then first baseman Paul Goldschmidt couldn't snag a high bouncer for an error that brought in the Dodgers' seventh run.	Parra recorded the first right field-to-first putout in Diamondbacks history when he threw out Haren after the pitcher appeared to have singled. It was the first throw-out at first from the right fielder in the majors in two seasons.	Game notes	The Dodgers struck out 15 times and were outhit 13-7. ... Gordon, who has nine steals, stole second in the sixth while Delgado was kicking the rubber and not paying attention. ... The Dodgers have Monday off, then open a three-game series in San Francisco on Tuesday. ... The New York Mets begin a three-game series at Arizona on Monday night. Josh Collmenter (0-0, 2.25 ERA) comes out of the bullpen to start for the Diamondbacks, Zack Wheeler (0-2, 2.25) goes for the Mets.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

NEW YORK -- With a little help from the replay room, Carlos Beltran and the banged-up Yankees did just enough to hold off Boston.	Beltran hit a two-run homer, Ivan Nova rebounded from a rough outing, and New York beat the Red Sox 3-2 Sunday night with the aid of another disputed video review that led to the ejection of Boston manager John Farrell.	"Extremely difficult to have any faith in the process that's being used," Farrell said.	Ichiro Suzuki robbed David Ortiz of extra bases in the eighth inning, crashing into the outfield fence for a spectacular catch, and New York took three of four in the first series of the season between the longtime rivals.	Beltran had three hits and was pressed into his first career appearance at first base when Francisco Cervelli was injured.	"We have to do what it takes," Beltran said. "I hope I don't have to do it again."	Mike Napoli homered and Felix Doubront (1-2) went 6 2/3 innings for the Red Sox, who scratched star second baseman Dustin Pedroia due to a sore left wrist.	New York, playing without Derek Jeter for the second consecutive game, scored its third run with the benefit of instant replay in the fourth.	With runners at the corners and one out, the Red Sox thought they turned an inning-ending double play on Cervelli's grounder. First base umpire Bob Davidson called Cervelli out on a bang-bang play, and Cervelli grabbed his right hamstring as he tumbled to the ground.	Yankees manager Joe Girardi challenged the call, which was overturned after a 3-minute replay review. That gave New York another run and a 3-1 lead.	Farrell, surely still bothered by a replay review that curiously went against Boston the day before, pointed to his eyes as he argued with two umpires. He was quickly ejected by Davidson.	Managers aren't allowed to argue replay rulings.	"We felt it was clear that the replay was inconclusive," Farrell said. "Any angle that we looked at, you couldn't tell if the foot was on the bag behind Mike Napoli's leg."	Major League Baseball acknowledged it made the wrong call on a replay challenge that went against the Red Sox during New York's 7-4 victory Saturday.	"Where this became conclusive is a hard pill to swallow," Farrell said. "On the heels of yesterday, it's hard to have any faith in the system."	Suzuki entered to run for Cervelli, who was filling in at first base for injured Mark Teixeira. When the Yankees took the field in the fifth, Suzuki was in right field, and Beltran moved from right field to first base -- with Cervelli's mitt.	"Thank God nobody hit the baseball to me," said Beltran, who made three putouts.	It was the first time Beltran had played any infield position in his 16-year career. Jeter was getting a rest and oft-injured second baseman Brian Roberts was sidelined with a sore back, preventing Girardi from shuffling his infielders after Cervelli went down.	"I didn't have a whole lot of choices tonight," Girardi said. "Just tells you the type of player he is. ... Willing to do anything you ask him to do. Very, very unselfish."	David Phelps struck out pinch-hitter Mike Carp with the bases loaded to end the eighth, pumping his fist as he bounced off the mound. Shawn Kelley struck out two in a perfect ninth for his third save.	Jacoby Ellsbury made a sliding catch in left-center to end it.	Nova (2-1) received a warm ovation after giving up two runs and eight hits with no walks in 7 1/3 innings. He was tagged by Baltimore for seven runs and 10 hits over 3 2/3 innings during a 14-5 loss in his previous outing.	"I thought he had better command of his curveball tonight, which was a huge difference," Girardi said.	Jonathan Herrera started in Pedroia's place and had an RBI single to go with a sensational defensive play.	Fans in the crowd of 46,081 chanted Jeter's name when Yankees infielder Yangervis Solarte came up limping in the sixth. Solarte stayed in the game.	Jeter was out of the lineup for the second straight day after feeling tightness in his right quadriceps Friday night. Girardi said he could have played Jeter, but wanted to give him three days off in a row -- the Yankees have a day off Monday.	Game notes	Red Sox OF Shane Victorino (strained right hamstring) ran the bases again and, like Pedroia, was headed to Boston for a checkup on Monday. If that turns out OK, Victorino is on track to begin a rehab assignment Tuesday with Double-A Portland, Farrell said. ... Cervelli's injury left the Yankees with no natural backup for catcher Brian McCann, shaken up in the eighth when Phelps hit A.J. Pierzynski with a pitch, and the ball deflected off McCann's right index finger. McCann, who stayed in the game, said he would have X-rays, but he was OK. "I knew the situation," McCann said. "We got by with a win."	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PHILADELPHIA -- The Braves keep showing they are resilient and powerful.	Dan Uggla hit two home runs, including a grand slam in the ninth inning, Monday night that lifted Atlanta to a wild 9-6 win over the Philadelphia Phillies.	Evan Gattis also homered twice and Uggla drove in five runs as the Braves won their fourth straight. The teams combined for five homers and 12 runs in the final two innings.	Gattis, Uggla and Andrelton Simmons hit consecutive homers in the eighth that put Atlanta ahead 5-1.	"We have a lot of guys who can change the game with one swing," Uggla said. "Tonight we were able to put some at-bats together. Didn't have much going early on but we were able to get to them."	Domonic Brown's three-run homer capped a five-run bottom of the eighth that gave the Phillies a 6-5 lead.	But the Braves rallied against Jake Diekman (1-1). B.J. Upton walked, Freddie Freeman reached on a grounder when second baseman Chase Utley made a questionable decision to try for a forceout and Justin Upton walked to load the bases with no outs.	After Gattis struck out swinging at a 98 mph fastball, Uggla drove an 0-1 slider from Diekman deep into the seats in left.	"(Diekman) has electric stuff," Uggla said. "It's not a comfortable at-bat at all. He throws really hard and has great stuff. We'll take it."	Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez was impressed with his team's comeback, but not surprised by it -- especially at hitter-friendly Citizens Bank Park.	"It's a resilient squad and in this ballpark we've seen it enough," Gonzalez said. "If you make a mistake, it's in the seats."	Neither team's closer was available. Philadelphia's Jonathan Papelbon wasn't used because he had pitched three straight days, and Atlanta's Craig Kimbrel has a sore shoulder.	"For all those people who say anybody can close in the ninth, it's a little different, a different animal," Gonzalez said.	Gonzalez said Kimbrel, who experienced discomfort after recording his fifth save of the season on Saturday, is day to day.	Luis Avilan (3-1) wound up with the win and David Carpenter got his first save.	Ryan Howard homered and Marlon Byrd drove in two runs for Philadelphia. Utley had two hits, and is batting .489 this season.	"We made a comeback," Philadelphia manager Ryne Sandberg said. "The guys really battled and had good at-bats. We just weren't able to close the door in the ninth."	Braves starter Ervin Santana matched his career high with 11 strikeouts. He pitched six innings and gave up one run and four hits.	"I've been so impressed with him," Gonzalez said. "He's got command, he's got some life, he knows how to pitch."	Gattis put Atlanta in front 2-1 with a two-run homer in the sixth off Roberto Hernandez. After the Braves hit three more homers in the eighth, the Phillies loaded the bases with no outs against Avilan.	Howard struck out looking, but Byrd hit a two-run single that made it 5-3. Brown gave Philadelphia the lead with his first homer since last Aug. 14.	The Upton brothers didn't get any hits, but they almost hit each other. Justin sent a liner that nearly took out B.J. as he led off third base. B.J. had to dive out of the way, got up slowly and stared at Justin in the batter's box in mock disgust.	Game notes	Freeman went 0-for-4, ending his nine-game hitting streak. ... Phillies C Carlos Ruiz made two throwing errors, both trying to nab B.J. Upton stealing second. ... Phillies RHP A.J. Burnett has been diagnosed with a hernia but will make his scheduled start on Wednesday. ... Philadelphia manager Ryne Sandberg said before the game that MLB executive Joe Torre called him to say that both the umpires and replay officials incorrectly ruled on a play at the plate on Sunday. Sandberg unsuccessfully argued on Sunday that Tony Gwynn Jr. didn't have a lane to home plate and should've been safe based under the new rules on catchers blocking the plate. ... Philadelphia reliever Mike Adams will be activated from the DL on Tuesday. Adams, who is recovering from right shoulder surgery, hasn't pitched since last June. ... Atlanta RHP David Hale (0-0, 2.89) is scheduled to face Phillies LHP Cliff Lee (2-1, 5.50) on Tuesday night.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BALTIMORE --  Tampa Bay left-hander Matt Moore will miss the remainder of the season after opting to have elbow-ligament replacement surgery.	Dr. James Andrews is to operate next week on the 24-year-old pitcher, who made the AL All-Star team last year. Moore will be the first Rays pitcher to undergo Tommy John surgery since Jason Isringhausen in June 2009.	"I can't help out on the competitive side of this business right now," Moore said Tuesday before rain washed out the Rays' game at the Orioles. "This is my first significant injury where I'm going to be missing a lot of time."	Manager John Maddon believes Moore's decision will be beneficial in the long term for the pitcher and the team.	"It's awful, but it's great," Maddon said. "It's awful that we're going to miss this guy for a bit. It's good for him to be able to get past this moment and look forward to a really long and prosperous career. Almost all of the time, percentage-wise, it's a very successful operation."	Moore hasn't pitched since walking off the mound with elbow soreness on April 7 in Kansas City. He was placed on the disabled list the following day.	"It was an injury that I didn't think would be my ligament. I didn't think it was going to be something like that," he said. "It just didn't feel that severe."	After throwing on the side Monday, Moore realized surgery was inevitable.	"I don't think there was a whole lot of hesitation," he said, noting that he felt pain "on every single pitch."	Moore also experienced elbow soreness last season while going 17-4 with a 3.29 ERA. He was 0-2 this year despite allowing only three runs in 10 innings.	Moore is among three Tampa Bay pitchers on the disabled list. Right-hander Jeremy Hellickson is recovering from arthroscopic right elbow surgery and right-hander Alex Cobb has a left oblique strain.	"It's tough," starter David Price said. "They're going to be working hard. They're going to be trying to get back here. Whenever they do, it's going to be a good little shot in the butt for us, and that's what you need throughout the season."	Maddon already has been forced to improvise his rotation. Left-hander Erik Bedard was going to start for the Rays on Thursday, but because of the rainout, Price will take the mound in the opener of a series against the New York Yankees.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

CINCINNATI -- After all those home runs and an overnight delay, it was settled by a single.	Andrew McCutchen doubled and came around on Russell Martin's single in the seventh inning Tuesday, giving the Pittsburgh Pirates an 8-7 victory over the Cincinnati Reds in the completion of a game that spanned two days and 10 home runs.	The National League Central rivals put on a record-setting show Monday night before the game was suspended after six innings because of rain. They combined for 10 homers in those six innings, the most for a game in Great American Ball Park's 12 seasons.	"You just keep playing," Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said. "It's something we take pride in. Things we can control, we try and stay on top of those. Things that are out of our control, you've got to let it go."	A few hundred fans were bundled in the stands when the game resumed with the temperature at 39 degrees. It was 66 degrees for the first pitch the previous evening.	McCutchen doubled off Sam LeCure (0-1) one out after play resumed and came around on a wild pitch and Martin's single up the middle, only the second run of the game that didn't come by way of a homer. McCutchen also singled in the ninth for his third hit of the game.	The Pirates improved to 6-2 in one-run games, while the Reds fell to 2-6.	"A big swing of the bat from Martin to drive in the plus-one, so it's another one-run game," Hurdle said.	Bryan Morris (2-0) gave up Devin Mesoraco's tying solo homer in the sixth inning Monday night but was still the pitcher of record. Jason Grilli pitched the ninth for his fourth save in five chances.	The Pirates had a double, three singles and a walk after play resumed. The Reds managed only a single and a walk.	"Last night, we go six innings and score 14 runs," Reds manager Bryan Price said. "It was a tale of two completely different games."	The teams wore their customary uniforms for the completion of the suspended game and then switched to commemorative No. 42 Jackie Robinson jerseys for the other game, which started 5 minutes later than originally scheduled.	The series opener will be remembered more for what happened during a downpour. Many of the 10 combined homers Monday were hit during a heavy rain -- players were surprised the balls cleared the walls under those conditions. Plus, both teams had struggled to score runs in the opening weeks of the season, ranking in the bottom three in the NL.	Those six innings rank among the wildest in major league history.	"It was a Twilight Zone game, to be honest with you," Price said.	Pittsburgh had three sets of back-to-back homers, only the third time that has happened in major league history, according to STATS. The other two times: Cincinnati against the Braves in 1956, and Boston against the Yankees in 1977.	Neil Walker and Gaby Sanchez went back-to-back twice, only the second time that has happened in Pirates history. Toby Atwell and Jerry Lynch also went back-to-back twice against the Reds on April 27, 1954, according to STATS.	Pittsburgh hit six homers -- all solo shots -- and the Reds had four, all with two outs. The teams had a combined 17 hits before the suspension, 10 of them homers.	NOTES: The teams finished two homers shy of the major league record for combined homers in a game. ... Pittsburgh's six homers were one shy of the club record. The six solo homers were one shy of the major league record for one team. The 1977 Red Sox and 2006 Braves hit seven solo homers in a game, according to STATS and SABR. ... Reds starter Homer Bailey gave up four homers, a career high. ... The Pirates have hit 14 homers in their past three games at Great American. They hit six during an 8-3 win Sept. 28 that clinched home-field advantage for the NL wild-card playoff, a 6-2 win over Cincinnati at PNC Park.

MIAMI -- The postgame scene in the Washington Nationals clubhouse included a smoke machine, strobe lights and blaring music, which created an atmosphere akin to a South Beach nightclub.	Following a woeful weekend, the Nationals had something to celebrate Monday.	Jordan Zimmermann became the first starter to pitch seven innings this season for the Nationals, and they totaled 11 extra-base hits to beat the slumping Miami Marlins 9-2.	The rout came after the Nationals were swept in a three-game series at Atlanta.	"That was a tough weekend, but they responded," manager Matt Williams said. "They came out today and played hard."	The Marlins endured their eighth loss in a row.	"The only way we can get out of this thing is somebody needs to step up, go out there and say, `It's over, I'm done with it," manager Mike Redmond said. "We either need a big pitching performance or a big hit or a big play to spark us to get us going. Those guys understand that, and hopefully it will come Tuesday."	Bryce Harper had two doubles and an RBI triple for Washington. He has batted .520 over his past seven games to boost his average to .348.	Harper came out of the game as a precaution in seventh inning after he slipped running the bases. He said he has been nursing a sore thigh muscle.	"It has been tight since Friday, but nothing too serious," Harper said. "I'm ready to go Tuesday."	Catcher Sandy Leon hit his first career home run, while Tyler Moore also homered and had an RBI single. Anthony Rendon drove in three runs with a double and a triple, and Danny Espinosa doubled and tripled.	"It was a fun night," Moore said in the smoke-filled clubhouse. "We needed that after three tough losses in a row. We're just trying to turn the page. We swung the bats good, and Jordan pitched great."	Zimmermann (1-0) bounced back from the shortest start of his career. After lasting only 1 2/3 innings when he gave up five runs against Miami last week, he lowered his ERA from 8.10 to 5.27, allowing two runs while striking out seven.	"It was a lot better today," he said. "I was getting ahead with the fastball. When I'm able to get ahead, I can throw everything else where I want and when I want. When I fall behind, that's when I run into trouble."	The right-hander gave up a homer to Garrett Jones but tied the Nationals record of 44 career victories set by Livan Hernandez. Zimmermann also had two of the Nationals' season-high 16 hits.	"A lot of guys on our team are swinging it well," Harper said. "It's contagious. Everybody is hitting it. It goes one through eight -- even one through nine."	The Nationals improved to 4-0 this year against the Marlins and have outscored them 31-10.	Washington started fast against Brad Hand after being swept in a three-game series at Atlanta last weekend. Jayson Werth missed a home run by inches when he doubled off the top of the wall with two out in the first, and Harper followed with an RBI single.	Moore skipped a ball off the top of the wall into the Marlins' bullpen for a homer in the second. Rendon hit a two-run double later in the inning to make it 4-0.	Hand (0-1) fell to 1-11 in his career as a starter. He lasted only three innings while allowing five runs and five extra-base hits.	Things are going so bad for the Marlins they brought in closer Steve Cishek trailing by seven runs in the ninth because he needed the work.	It likely won't get any easier for the Marlins on Tuesday, when they face Stephen Strasburg. He beat them last week and began this week leading the NL in strikeouts.	Game notes	Nationals RHP Doug Fister (back muscle) threw 50 pitches in a bullpen session and said he felt good afterward. The next step for him is a simulated game. ... Nationals OF Nate McLouth missed his second start in a row because of a sore left knee. ... With a left-hander pitching for Miami, 1B Adam LaRoche sat out for the first time this season. ... Marlins OF Marcell Ozuna was held out of the starting lineup after bruising his foot when he fouled a ball off it Sunday. ... INF Rafael Furcal (hamstring) began a rehabilitation assignment Monday that is expected to last three weeks, meaning he won't join the Marlins until early May. ... Marlins 1B Garrett Jones is a fan of pro wrestling, and his new theme song when he bats is a tune used by The Ultimate Warrior, who died last week.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  While manager Lloyd McClendon is no fan of the transfer rule, he certainly has no problem challenging the application of it to get the Seattle Mariners a run.	Seattle had a six-run outburst in an inning that included three Texas errors and an overturned call that led to the ejection of Rangers manager Ron Washington during the Mariners' 7-1 victory Monday night.	Seattle had the bases loaded in the sixth, already with four runs in, when Brad Miller hit a comebacker. Relief pitcher Pedro Figueroa threw home, and umpire Paul Schrieber initially ruled a forceout even though catcher J.P. Arencibia bobbled the ball on a transfer without dropping it or making a throw.	McClendon challenged, and the call was reversed after a replay review of 3 minutes, 31 seconds. That erased the out and gave Seattle another run.	"I thought it was a clear violation of the rules," McClendon said. "It was an impactful play."	Asked his feeling on the transfer rule, which is being enforced more closely with expanded replay this season, the manager responded, "I wish it would all go away, but it is what it is, and we just have to deal with it."	Arencibia, charged with an error, said he was off the plate before losing control of the ball.	"I think that's something that baseball needs to clean up because there are a lot of plays that have happened this year that are outs and giving teams extra outs," Arencibia said. "I don't think it's baseball. Outfielders who have caught the ball and run four steps after they catch it, run into the wall and turn and throw the ball in and it falls out, and automatically safe. It doesn't make sense."	Roenis Elias (1-1) allowed one run and struck out five over 6 2/3 innings for his first major league victory. The left-hander, who defected from Cuba to Mexico in 2010, has a 2.16 ERA in three career starts.	"I came here to make it to the big leagues. I knew I could pitch in the big leagues," Elias said through a translator. "I was throwing my pitches like I wanted. The curveball I threw today is what I normally throw."	The Mariners went ahead to stay on Mike Zunino's solo homer in the fifth off Colby Lewis (0-1), who made his first big league start in 21 months after elbow and hip operations. Zunino added an RBI single in that wild sixth that started with Robinson Cano's leadoff single.	Cano scored on Michael Saunders' triple to left-center -- a ball that center fielder Leonys Martin bobbled without getting charged with an error. Kyle Seager followed with an RBI single that chased Lewis, and then things got interesting.	Dustin Ackley and Zunino had consecutive RBI singles after Arencibia couldn't pull in a foul ball before reaching out and teetering over a camera-well railing. Mix in two fielding errors, and the bases were loaded.	Washington immediately came out to argue after the overturned call and was ejected by crew chief Ted Barrett because managers aren't allowed to argue replay rulings. Washington's ejection came a night after Boston manager John Farrell became the first big league skipper tossed under those circumstances this season.	"It was obvious he caught the ball, the runner was at least 9 or 10 feet from home plate, making his move away from home plate so he don't have contact, you go to get the ball and he drops it," Washington said. "I'm all for the review, but still that don't mean you have to agree with some of the calls that go on because of review."	Umpires in New York confirmed the play was overturned because Arencibia never had secure possession while transferring the ball from his glove to his hand.	Lewis made his first major league start since July 18, 2012, allowing four runs (three earned) over 5 1/3 innings. He struck out four and walked one.	The 34-year-old Lewis had right hip resurfacing surgery last August. He is the first known major league pitcher to come back after the procedure to remove bone spurs without a full hip replacement.	"I'd like to thank the Texas Rangers and the organization for giving me an opportunity tonight. It wouldn't have meant as much for me to get back out there without having this uniform on," Lewis said. "Overall, I felt great. Everything was really, really good."	Game notes	 Seattle had gone 21 consecutive innings without a run before Zunino's third homer. ... Texas scored a single run for the third time in four games -- the others were 1-0 victories over Houston.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MILWAUKEE -- Lance Lynn brought the Brewers' fast start to a halt.	Mixing a fastball that topped 95 mph with his effective slider, the St. Louis Cardinals right-hander struck out 11 and allowed three hits over seven innings in a 4-0 victory Monday night to snap Milwaukee's nine-game winning streak.	Lynn (3-0) frustrated the Brewers all night. He left Carlos Gomez twisting in the batter's box on swings and misses. He made Jonathan Lucroy, a .357 hitter, whiff badly on a fastball low in the zone in the second and froze Scooter Gennett on a heater outside.	"Location. He was making good pitches early on and it looked like he had a little more life," Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said.	Jhonny Peralta hit a solo shot in the second off Brewers starter Matt Garza, and Jon Jay had a three-run homer to the right field corner in the sixth. Reliever Carlos Martinez tossed two scoreless innings to finish off the surprising Brewers, who still have the majors' best record at 10-3.	Manager Ron Roenicke said he didn't think Garza (0-2) had his best stuff, yet Garza kept pace with Lynn until running into trouble in the sixth. Allen Craig reached on a fielder's choice with two outs and Peralta singled to set up Jay's homer off a hanging breaking ball.	Until then, the Brewers seemed as though they were close to getting out of the jam after throwing out a runner at home and retiring a runner trying to advance to third for the second out.	"I felt we had momentum after we had the tag at home ... and then (Jay's homer) was a backbreaker," Garza said. "But we're fine. We'll come back and we'll start a new (streak) tomorrow."	Lynn cooled off a Brewers team that was off to its best start since opening the 1987 season with 13 straight wins.	Milwaukee's best hope to score came in the fifth after No. 8 hitter Logan Schafer doubled to right with two outs to put runners at second and third. But that brought Garza, a career .094 hitter, to the plate and he struck out on three pitches.	Otherwise, the Brewers didn't get another runner past second. Lynn boasted a career 2.53 ERA in 10 games against the Brewers coming in, and his mastery of Milwaukee continued.	"He throws the nice breaking ball and he usually keeps the ball down well," Roenicke said. "Every time I've seen the guy, he's tough."	With Lynn in control, about the only other drama provided by the Cardinals was when leadoff hitter Matt Carpenter was ejected in the fifth after apparently saying something to umpire Bob Davidson following a called third strike.	"Matt didn't like what he saw; the umpire didn't like Matt's opinion of what he saw. He said something to Matt, Matt returned something -- there was no foul language -- but the umpire had heard enough," Matheny said. "We were barking the majority of the game.	"Hopefully there's no follow-up on that. Checking out the pitch, it wasn't a pitch he should be swinging at. That's frustrating. You can't take emotions out of this game."	Garza allowed nine hits and four runs while striking out six in seven innings. Rookie reliever Wei-Chung Wang, a Rule 5 pick, pitched a scoreless ninth in his big league debut.	Game notes	Cardinals C Yadier Molina got a day off after catching the first 12 games of the season. ... Injured 2B Mark Ellis played his first game on a rehab assignment Sunday at Triple-A Memphis. Ellis, who is on the 15-day DL for left knee tendinitis, played five innings and went 1-for-3 with a run. He was scheduled to play Monday, though Memphis' game may have been affected by weather. "He didn't have any issues and felt good afterward, which was the main thing," Matheny said. "He's on the right track to joining us here soon." ... Wang, 21, of Taiwan, also saw snow for the first time and got his first major league paycheck Monday. Flurries fell before the game outside Miller Park, which has a retractable roof. ... St. Louis RHP Shelby Miller (0-2) faces Milwaukee's Marco Estrada (1-0) on Tuesday.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PHOENIX --  Zack Wheeler pitched effectively, New York's hitters lashed balls all over Chase Field and the Mets walked away with a much-needed win.	What's concerning is what it may cost them down the road.	New York opened a three-game series in the desert with a 7-3 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Monday night, but lost Juan Lagares and Curtis Granderson to injuries.	Granderson should be OK in a few days after injuring his left forearm and ribs during a collision with the wall, but Lagares could be out for a little while after straining his right hamstring legging out a grounder.	"We look at the big picture, it's tough for us," Mets manager Terry Collins said. "It's really tough. He's played absolutely great, he's swung the bat well, he's earned that right to be out there every day. For this to happen to him now, it's a tough break for him and a tough break for everybody."	Granderson hit the wall while tracking down a flyball by Miguel Montero in the first inning and left in the sixth as his arm and ribs got progressively sorer. X-rays were negative.	Lagares could be out a little longer.	New York's best hitter at .319, he raced hard down the line on a fielder's choice in the seventh. He tried to stay in the game, but left after consulting with the Mets' trainer.	The injuries overshadowed what had been a solid game for New York, which has yet to get on track early in the season.	David Wright added two RBIs and the Mets had 13 hits to open a three-game series. Wheeler (1-2) worked around traffic to end a five-start winless streak and Carlos Torres got the final eight outs for his first career save.	Lagares will be evaluated Tuesday morning to see how severe the injury is.	"Grandy will be OK, but somebody's got to step up, someone else has got to be the guy," Collins said.	The Diamondbacks continued to struggle at home.	Montero had three RBIs, but Josh Collmenter (0-1) gave up three runs the first three innings and Arizona was unable to bounce back, losing its sixth straight at home, the longest streak since Aug. 24-29, 2012.	"We're just not in sync," Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson said.	The Mets and Diamondbacks entered this three-game series hoping to get a spark after a difficult start to the season.	Pitching has been a problem during the Mets' mediocre run.	New York is 26th in the majors with a 4.97 ERA and is the worst in baseball at keeping the ball in the yard, giving up 21 homers. Bartolo Colon gave up four on Sunday, when the Mets allowed 11 extra-base hits -- tied for second-most in team history -- in a 14-2 loss to Anaheim.	Wheeler gave up plenty of baserunners, but no homers and only a couple of runs.	Montero hit a run-scoring double off the right-hander in the first inning -- when Granderson crashed into the wall -- and added a sacrifice fly in the third. Wheeler worked around runners over the next four innings before being lifted with one out in the seventh.	He allowed two runs on six hits in 6 2/3 innings.	"I did have the three walks, which was a bit of a disappointment, but I did get faster outs," Wheeler said. "I kept my pitch count down, for the most part."	Arizona has struggled with its own pitching woes, entering the game with a baseball-worst 5.95 ERA.	Hoping to give their beleaguered bullpen a rest, the Diamondbacks turned to Collmenter, a one-time starter who turned into an innings-eating reliever.	The over-the-top-throwing right-hander was moved up to the rotation after Randall Delgado and Trevor Cahill were moved to the bullpen after struggling.	Collmenter didn't help the bullpen much, giving up three runs in four innings in his first start since Sept. 30, 2012.	"I hit a lot of my spots, they fouled a lot of pitches off and I didn't get outs early," Collmenter said. "I was happy with my command, for the most part."	New York added two more runs in the fifth inning against Mike Bolsinger in his major league debut, going up 5-2 on run-scoring singles by Granderson and Duda.	Wright had an RBI single in New York's two-run eighth off Ryan Rowland-Smith.	Game notes	 Lagares extended his hitting streak to nine games with a second-inning double. ... Bolsinger allowed two runs on six hits in three innings. ... Mets RHP Jenrry Mejia will be looking to cut down on his walks in the second game of the series against Arizona on Tuesday. He's walked nine in 11 innings his first two starts, though has yet to lose (1-0). ... RHP Bronson Arroyo, who will start against the Mets, is 8-3 with a 3.63 ERA in 14 career starts against New York.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- John Jaso came up big again as a pinch hitter with a home run against Los Angeles Angels closer Ernesto Frieri, a year and five days after doing the same thing to Kevin Jepsen at Angel Stadium -- a place where Jaso just loves to hit.	Jaso's go-ahead, two-run shot in the ninth inning sent the Oakland Athletics to a 3-2 victory Monday night. Yoenis Cespedes also went deep for the A's, offsetting Albert Pujols' 496th home run.	Frieri (0-1) was trying to preserve a 2-1 lead for starter Hector Santiago when Josh Donaldson led off the ninth with a single and Cespedes flied out. Jaso batted for Derek Norris and drove a 1-2 pitch deep into the right-field seats for his first homer of the season and the first by an A's pinch-hitter.	"Donaldson hit that ball hard to start off the inning, and it kind of started there," Jaso said. "I think Cespy just missed a pitch, too, so we definitely had some good swings going and some good momentum against Frieri.	"He showed me one changeup earlier in the at-bat and got a strike, so I thought he was going to go back with an off-speed pitch -- especially after I fouled off a couple of his fastballs," Jaso added. "But he came back with another heater and left it out over the plate. My timing was a little bit better on that particular pitch, and it looked really good to hit."	Jaso has six homers and 21 RBIs at Angel Stadium along with a .424 average, the highest by any player with at least 75 plate appearances at the "Big A."	"He got a really good pitch to hit and the ball went out," Frieri said. "In that situation, he's looking for something middle-in to drive in the air -- especially when they have a man on base. He hit a mistake pitch. Don't get me wrong, he made good contact, but I was trying to go down and away."	It appeared Frieri needed more consoling from Santiago than vice versa.	"I closed in 2012, so I know how it is, man. You've got to have a short memory and forget about it," Santiago said. "He's going to close more games than he blows. He said `Sorry' to me, but I told him: `No, don't worry about it, man. We're all out here battling.' I could have given up a two-run homer and given up the lead in the seventh."	Santiago allowed a run and five hits while striking out three in his fourth start for the Angels after spending his three previous big league seasons with the Chicago White Sox. A two-out homer by Cespedes in the fourth was Oakland's only run against the left-hander.	The Angels lost a replay challenge in the ninth after Howie Kendrick was ruled out by first base umpire Chris Segal on a grounder in the hole that second baseman Nick Punto bobbled before throwing to Daric Barton.	Jim Johnson (1-2) got the victory with a scoreless eighth, and Luke Gregerson earned his second save.	Jesse Chavez allowed two runs -- one earned -- and four hits in seven innings with nine strikeouts and no walks. Oakland's starting pitchers have yielded three earned runs or fewer in every game so far, the second-longest streak by an A's rotation at the beginning of a season since a 16-game stretch in 1981, when manager Billy Martin's starters were Mike Norris, Rick Langford, Matt Keough, Steve McCatty and Brian Kingman.	"It certainly hurts to lose two important guys like (Jarrod) Parker and (A.J.) Griffin," manager Bob Melvin said. "But when you have guys like Jesse Chavez and Tommy Milone that are going to step in and hold the fort down and compete at a high level, that's what we expect from those guys. So we have the depth."	Pujols, closing in on 500 homers, a celebrated milestone achieved by 25 players in major league history, has four homers and eight RBIs in his last six games after driving in only one run in 30 at-bats over his first seven games.	The three-time NL MVP also had an RBI single in the opener of a 19-game season series between the AL West rivals, who have combined to win 11 division titles over the past 14 years. The two-time Gold Glove first baseman frustrated the A's in the eighth by starting a slick double play on Jed Lowrie's grounder.	Game notes	Oakland CF and leadoff hitter Coco Crisp didn't play because of tightness in his left hamstring. ... Los Angeles 3B David Freese was 0-for-4 with two strikeouts. He has five hits and 13 K's in his first 43 at-bats with the Angels.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

SAN DIEGO --  The light-hitting San Diego Padres found a way to win without having to get a hit.	The Padres scored two runs in the eighth inning on Rex Brothers' wild pitch and catcher Edwin Rosario's errant throw back to the plate for a 5-4 win over the Colorado Rockies on Monday night.	"You have to hang around long enough and stay close and things like this will happen," Padres manager Bud Black said.	The Rockies held a one-run lead when Brothers walked the bases loaded with two outs. Facing Yasmani Grandal, Brothers unleashed a wild throw. As Rosario retrieved the pitch, he turned and threw wildly back to Brothers covering the plate.	The ball was out of Brothers' reach as Xavier Nady scored and, as the ball sailed past the mound, Seth Smith also came around to score as the Padres took a 5-4 lead.	"I didn't know (if I could score) but I knew was going to go and make them throw me out," Smith said. "I was that situation where you're the winning run and you're already halfway there, and the ball just got by the pitcher, so they have to make at least a decent play to get me out."	Brothers (1-2) allowed a game-winning homer to Brandon Crawford on Sunday in San Francisco's 5-4 win in 10 innings.	"I don't have an excuse," Brothers said. "As hard as it is, I'll put it behind me and get my butt back out there and get the job done for these other guys."	Said Rockies manager Walt Weiss: "He struggled with his command, and his slider was bouncing well in front of the plate. He wasn't getting swings on his slider like he usually does."	Dale Thayer (2-0) pitched a perfect eighth inning and Huston Street worked the ninth for his fourth save.	"It was a lucky bounce for us and we haven't got any in two years, so we deserved it," said Yonder Alonso, who drew the walk that loaded the bases in the eighth.	San Diego is last in the National Leagues in runs scored with 33 and near the bottom in batting average.	Rosario hit a two-run homer off Eric Stults with a drive into the left-field seats in the fifth inning to give Colorado a 4-0 lead.	Rockies rookie Jordan Lyles gave most of the lead back in the bottom of the inning when he allowed three runs.	"That was a big part of the game by bouncing back and getting back in it with clutch hits," Black said.	Lyles allowed three runs on six hits over five innings.	The Rockies lost for the sixth time in eight road games.	Pinch-hitter Tommy Medica and Everth Cabrera had consecutive run-scoring doubles and Alexi Amarista followed with a run-scoring triple as San Diego cut the lead to 4-3 in the fifth.	Rockies right fielder Michael Cuddyer was injured on Amarista's hit when he fell backward attempting to catch the ball as it went over his head. Cuddyer crashed hard into the right field message board and stayed slumped on the warning track before being removed from the game a few minutes later with a bruised right elbow.	Stults allowed four runs -- three earned -- on nine hits over five innings.	Game notes	 Colorado placed LHP Brett Anderson on the 15-day disabled list Monday with a broken left index finger. OF Cory Dickerson was recalled from Triple-A Colorado Springs. ... Padres LF Carlos Quentin (left knee bone bruise), who has been on the 15-day DL since the start of the season, took a full round of batting practice, but there is still no timetable for his return. ... The teams continue their four-game series Tuesday night with Rockies RHP Juan Nicasio (1-0, 3.75 ERA) set to face Padres LHP Robbie Erlin (1-0, 1.35).

CINCINNATI -- After all those home runs and an overnight delay, it was settled by a single.	Andrew McCutchen doubled and came around on Russell Martin's single in the seventh inning Tuesday, giving the Pittsburgh Pirates an 8-7 victory over the Cincinnati Reds in the completion of a game that spanned two days and 10 home runs.	The National League Central rivals put on a record-setting show Monday night before the game was suspended after six innings because of rain. They combined for 10 homers in those six innings, the most for a game in Great American Ball Park's 12 seasons.	"You just keep playing," Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said. "It's something we take pride in. Things we can control, we try and stay on top of those. Things that are out of our control, you've got to let it go."	A few hundred fans were bundled in the stands when the game resumed with the temperature at 39 degrees. It was 66 degrees for the first pitch the previous evening.	McCutchen doubled off Sam LeCure (0-1) one out after play resumed and came around on a wild pitch and Martin's single up the middle, only the second run of the game that didn't come by way of a homer. McCutchen also singled in the ninth for his third hit of the game.	The Pirates improved to 6-2 in one-run games, while the Reds fell to 2-6.	"A big swing of the bat from Martin to drive in the plus-one, so it's another one-run game," Hurdle said.	Bryan Morris (2-0) gave up Devin Mesoraco's tying solo homer in the sixth inning Monday night but was still the pitcher of record. Jason Grilli pitched the ninth for his fourth save in five chances.	The Pirates had a double, three singles and a walk after play resumed. The Reds managed only a single and a walk.	"Last night, we go six innings and score 14 runs," Reds manager Bryan Price said. "It was a tale of two completely different games."	The teams wore their customary uniforms for the completion of the suspended game and then switched to commemorative No. 42 Jackie Robinson jerseys for the other game, which started 5 minutes later than originally scheduled.	The series opener will be remembered more for what happened during a downpour. Many of the 10 combined homers Monday were hit during a heavy rain -- players were surprised the balls cleared the walls under those conditions. Plus, both teams had struggled to score runs in the opening weeks of the season, ranking in the bottom three in the NL.	Those six innings rank among the wildest in major league history.	"It was a Twilight Zone game, to be honest with you," Price said.	Pittsburgh had three sets of back-to-back homers, only the third time that has happened in major league history, according to STATS. The other two times: Cincinnati against the Braves in 1956, and Boston against the Yankees in 1977.	Neil Walker and Gaby Sanchez went back-to-back twice, only the second time that has happened in Pirates history. Toby Atwell and Jerry Lynch also went back-to-back twice against the Reds on April 27, 1954, according to STATS.	Pittsburgh hit six homers -- all solo shots -- and the Reds had four, all with two outs. The teams had a combined 17 hits before the suspension, 10 of them homers.	NOTES: The teams finished two homers shy of the major league record for combined homers in a game. ... Pittsburgh's six homers were one shy of the club record. The six solo homers were one shy of the major league record for one team. The 1977 Red Sox and 2006 Braves hit seven solo homers in a game, according to STATS and SABR. ... Reds starter Homer Bailey gave up four homers, a career high. ... The Pirates have hit 14 homers in their past three games at Great American. They hit six during an 8-3 win Sept. 28 that clinched home-field advantage for the NL wild-card playoff, a 6-2 win over Cincinnati at PNC Park.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MIAMI -- Stephen Strasburg against the woebegone Miami Marlins figured to be no contest, and it was.	Miami won in a rout.	Giancarlo Stanton tied a career high with five RBIs, including a three-run homer off Strasburg, and the Marlins broke an eight-game losing streak by beating the Washington Nationals 11-2 on Tuesday night.	Both benches and bullpens cleared briefly in the fourth inning when Marlins catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia and the Nationals' Ian Desmond engaged in a heated, nose-to-nose conversation at home plate. Desmond was unhappy that Marlins starter Tom Koehler threw several pitches high and inside.	Among the tunes playing in the Miami clubhouse after the victory was Alice Cooper's "No More Mr. Nice Guy."	"It feels great," Saltalamacchia said. "We faced a great pitcher. It feels great to be able to make him work tonight."	Strasburg (1-2) allowed six runs and eight hits in four innings. He fell to 2-3 at Marlins Park with an ERA of 8.61.	"We've put together some pretty good at-bats off him over the last couple of years and had some good games against him," Miami manager Mike Redmond said. "We had a nice plan. Guys were aggressive. He threw quite a few fastballs early in the count, and we were ready for them."	That often has been hitters' approach against Strasburg so far this season.	"They don't want me to get comfortable," the right-hander said. "A lot of the dominant pitchers with swing-and-miss stuff, that's what their approach is going to be. I felt I had a good mindset today. It was one of those days where it seemed like every pitch I threw, they hit it."	Koehler (2-1) allowed one hit and five walks in seven scoreless innings to lower his ERA to 1.89. The performance was a welcome change for a team that had an ERA of 6.12 during the losing streak.	Desmond became annoyed when he barely avoided being hit by an inside pitch from Koehler. Desmond hollered at Koehler and spat toward the mound.	Saltalamacchia then said something to Desmond, and their testy exchange began. Umpire Marty Foster stepped between them, and the confrontation didn't escalate.	"I wasn't necessarily thinking that he had intentions of hitting me," Desmond said. "It wasn't intended to escalate to what it did but was heat-of-the-moment stuff."	Koehler said he went into the game mindful of the need to pitch inside against the Nationals.	"Guys tend to get a little upset when they get crowded," Koehler said. "They had been attacking fastballs over the plate. It's our job as starters to make sure they know that's our part of the plate. We've been beaten inside too many times late in the game in the last couple of series because we haven't established inside."	Stanton homered in the first inning, hit a two-run double in the fifth and scored three times. He went into the game ranked second in the majors in RBIs and now has 21. He's batting .429 with runners in scoring position.	Marcell Ozuna tied a career high with four hits, and Casey McGehee had three of the Marlins' 15 hits.	"We talked Monday about having guys step up," Redmond said. "We saw the entire team step up. We feel like our lineup can do a lot of damage, and I think you saw that tonight."	The Marlins beat Washington for the first time in five tries this season and for only the third time in 16 meetings since July.	Zach Walters hit his first career homer in the ninth for the Nationals, who totaled five hits.	Miami led 3-0 before Strasburg got an out. Christian Yelich and Ozuna singled, and Stanton followed with a homer to center field.	The Marlins added three more runs in the second. Adeiny Hechavarria led off with a triple on his 25th birthday, Ozuna singled home a run and McGehee hit a two-out, two-run single.	Strasburg struck out five to increase his NL-leading total to 33, but his ERA rose to 6.00. The Marlins added five runs in the fifth to make it 11-0.	"One of those games," Nationals manager Matt Williams said. "But nonetheless it's important that we play well, and we didn't. That's troubling."	Game notes	Nationals OF Denard Span (concussion) might be ready for a rehabilitation assignment by the end of the week, Williams said. ... Nationals OF Nate McLouth returned to the lineup after sitting out two games because of a sore left knee. ... Ozuna was back in the lineup after missing one start with a bruised foot. ... The Nationals' Steven Souza singled for his first major league hit. ... Miami RHP Jose Fernandez tries to improve to 12-0 at home when he pitches Wednesday against Tanner Roark.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.
