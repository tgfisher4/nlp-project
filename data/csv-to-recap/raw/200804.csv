ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Edwin Jackson is beginning to repay the Tampa Bay Rays for their patience.	The right-hander allowed two hits in eight innings and the Rays pulled out of an offensive funk to beat the Seattle Mariners 7-0 Thursday to stop a four-game losing streak.	A 15-game loser in 2007, Jackson combined on a three-hitter and improved to 2-0. He didn't get his first victory until June 24 last season, and had nine losses before getting his second win nearly a month later.	"When we lose four in a row, we all know that someone has to come and try to put out the fire," Jackson said. "That was the objective for today -- to try to keep the team in [the game] and go for the win."	Eric Hinske homered off Miguel Batista (0-2) and Mike DiFelice drove in three runs to help the Rays win for the first time since Jackson allowed one run in six innings to beat the New York Yankees on Saturday.	DiFelice had a RBI single off Batista, who gave up four runs and eight hits in six-plus innings. B.J. Upton's seventh-inning single off Eric O'Flaherty drove in the last two runs charged to the Seattle starter, and DiFelice followed with a two-run single for a 7-0 lead.	The Rays scored five times in the seventh and finished with 10 hits. They had scored seven runs and hit .167 during their four-game losing streak.	Jackson limited the Mariners to Adrian Beltre's leadoff single in the fourth and Raul Ibanez's two-out single in the sixth. He struck out six, walked four and only allowed one runner to reach third base.	Trever Miller pitched the ninth for Tampa Bay, giving up a leadoff single to Beltre before getting Ibanez to ground into a double play and striking out Richie Sexson to end the game.	Tampa Bay pitched a shutout for the first time since a 1-0 win at Boston on Sept. 10. Seattle was blanked for the first time since a 6-0 loss at Anaheim on Aug. 27.	"When you throw a game like that to snap a four-game losing streak, it does a lot for your own self confidence," Tampa Bay manager Joe Maddon said. "I'm almost eager to see how he comes out on his next start and follows up, because he's had two very good starts in a row."	Jackson began last season as Tampa Bay's No. 4 starter and retained the spot despite losing his first eight decisions. He stopped the skid by beating the Los Angeles Dodgers on June 24, then didn't get his second victory until July 20.	He pitched the only complete game of his career -- a 3-0, four-hit shutout at Texas last Aug. 11 -- but he thought Thursday's performance might have been better. If the score had been closer entering the ninth, Maddon said he would have allowed Jackson to finish up.	"I just told myself that it's a matter of time and you're going to go through your battles. You can't pay attention to the short-term memory. It can't be like that forever," Jackson said of his 2007 struggles. "I'm going to have my bad times -- I still might have them -- but I need to pick the team up when we need it."	Batista held the Rays hitless until Hinske's solo homer with one out in the fourth. Jonny Gomes doubled off the Mariners' starter in the sixth, then scored on DiFelice's broken-bat single for a 2-0 lead.	The Mariners went 2-5 on a seven-game road trip that began with four straight losses at Baltimore.	"It was not a good road trip," Seattle manager John McLaren said. "We did win the [Tampa Bay] series, but the Baltimore series really set us back. Now we've got to go home and get a winning streak started."	Game notes	 Seattle C Kenji Johjima is in an 0-for-22 slump. ... Mariners closer J.J. Putz threw for 10 minutes on level ground in his second throwing session since injuring his rib cage on April 1. He could be cleared soon to work off a mound. "No problems, we feel good about that," McLaren said. "A real positive throwing session for J.J." ... Tampa Bay 3B Willy Aybar sat out with a sore left hamstring. He was replaced by Hinske. ... Rays LHP Scott Kazmir, on the 15-day DL because of an elbow strain, is scheduled to throw a batting practice session Friday.

MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Francisco Cordero said it didn't really bother him to get booed by the fans who used to cheer him on.	In fact, he said, the harsh reception gave him a little extra motivation -- something he showed by mowing down three of the Milwaukee Brewers' biggest bats to earn a save in the Cincinnati Reds' 4-1 victory Thursday.	"They're probably a little upset that I left," Cordero said. "They probably want me back."	Cordero's new teammates, meanwhile, thought it was hilarious.	"Man, they booed [you] worse than they booed me," Ken Griffey Jr. hooted in the clubhouse afterward. "That was tremendous!"	Cordero's second save of the season came after eight strong innings from starter Aaron Harang, who gave up a soft RBI single to J.J. Hardy in the second and then held the Brewers' potent offense scoreless until Cordero came in for the ninth.	With the victory, Cincinnati rebounded from Tuesday's loss to take two out of three from the Brewers. Cincinnati held Milwaukee to eight runs in three games.	"It shows that we've definitely turned it around, and I think we're going to be a team to be reckoned with," Harang said.	Cordero, who left Milwaukee to sign a four-year, $46 million contract with Cincinnati in the offseason, said he enjoyed facing Prince Fielder, Ryan Braun and Bill Hall.	"They've all got power," Cordero said. "Just in a blink, they can tie the game. So you've got to go right at it and try to get it done quick."	He did, getting Fielder to pop out, striking out Braun on a slider and getting Hall to ground out.	Brewers manager Ned Yost, who has patiently watched new closer Eric Gagne blow two of his first three save opportunities, was asked if it was strange to see Cordero in another uniform.	"No," Yost said. "It's reality."	Meanwhile, Fielder is dealing with his own reality: He hasn't hit a home run yet.	"It's god-awful," Fielder said. "Being in the middle of the lineup, I have to do a little better. I'll just keep going out there swinging hard."	Harang (1-1) allowed five hits, striking out three without a walk. He threw 74 of his 99 pitches for strikes.	"The fact that they know I'm going to be out there throwing strikes just makes them have to swing the bat," Harang said.	Harang said the addition of Cordero "locks up" the back end of the Reds' pitching staff. And he couldn't help but chuckle about the boos Cordero received from Brewers fans.	"I had to see that," Harang said, laughing. "That was something special."	Brewers starter Carlos Villanueva (1-1) held the Reds hitless into the fifth inning, when he gave up a single to Scott Hatteberg and an RBI double by Paul Bako. Tied 1-1 going into the seventh, Cincinnati chased Villanueva with three runs.	Adam Dunn led off the inning with a half-swing flare over Hall, who plays third for Milwaukee but was standing at shortstop as part of a defensive shift. Edwin Encarnacion then hit the first pitch he saw from Villanueva for his second homer of the season.	Reds manager Dusty Baker gave Encarnacion, who was hitless in his last 17 at-bats after going 0-for-4 Tuesday, the day off Wednesday.	"He was ready to go," Baker said. "Sometimes, you've got to clear your mind. My job as a manager is knowing when -- or at least guessing when."	The Reds took a 4-1 lead when Hatteberg doubled and scored on a single by Bako.	Cincinnati had a chance for an even bigger inning after Harang punched a single past Hall -- making up for a failed squeeze play in the fifth -- but Griffey hit into a double play with the bases loaded to end the inning.	Game notes	 Yost said the Brewers would prefer to give Yovani Gallardo another minor-league rehab start before bringing him up. But with rain forecast for this weekend's series against the Mets in New York, Gallardo will be with the team just in case weather disrupts the rotation. Gallardo is rehabbing a left knee injury. ... With three games in Pittsburgh followed by a day off Monday, Baker said he might juggle his rotation to keep Harang on his regular five-day schedule.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- Kevin Millwood has fulfilled his goal of getting off to a good start this season. Now the Texas Rangers' No. 1 starter finally has a victory to show for it.	Millwood allowed one run in seven innings and the Rangers beat Baltimore 3-1 in the first game of a doubleheader Thursday, ending the Orioles' six-game winning streak.	Coming off a complete-game 2-1 loss, after losing the season opener despite giving up only two unearned runs, Millwood (1-2) won his sixth straight start against the Orioles and lowered his ERA this season to 1.29.	"We need him to lead this pitching staff, and he's doing that," manager Ron Washington said.	"To have something to show for it is awfully nice," Millwood said.	The Rangers scored only one run for Millwood in each of his first two starts, both on the road. They were tied 1-1 against the Orioles after Millwood had thrown the last of his 111 pitches but scored twice in the seventh on Michael Young's RBI single and a sacrifice fly by Josh Hamilton.	Baltimore (6-2), which had matched its longest winning streak of last season, entered the game with the AL's best record.	The Orioles had only three hits against Millwood, including an RBI single by Ramon Hernandez. Millwood struck out two and overcame five walks, one short of his career high.	"I wasn't throwing where I wanted to. Hopefully, it was just one of those days ... My curveball stunk, and that is usually my out pitch," Millwood said. "But I felt like I was able to make a few pitches when I needed to."	Ian Kinsler started the go-ahead rally for Texas with a one-out single off Steve Trachsel (1-1). Kinsler then stole second and scored on Young's single. Young also stole second and went to third on catcher Hernandez's throw into center field before Hamilton's sacrifice fly -- the second time he drove in Young.	"Those are the type of innings we want to produce, especially when we're not scoring runs," Washington said. "We're trying to be smart."	C.J. Wilson worked a perfect ninth for his second save of the season. Joaquin Benoit struck out three of the four batters he faced in the eighth after taking over for Millwood.	Texas got an unearned run in the first when Young reached on an error when his flyball to right field was misplayed by Nick Markakis and scored on Hamilton's double. Five of Hamilton's nine hits this season are for extra bases.	Aubrey Huff drew a leadoff walk in the second inning, stole second and came home on the single by Hernandez.	Millwood faced the minimum three hitters only twice in his seven innings, and one of those times was when Luke Scott was caught stealing after drawing a walk. Millwood got out of a one-out, bases-loaded jam in the third when Huff lined out and Scott took a called third strike.	Trachsel gave up three runs and five hits over 6 1/3 innings, leaving after Young's single. The 37-year-old right-hander struck out two and walked four.	"Both starting pitchers were on their game. Trachsel made some great pitches. Millwood is a crafty veteran, and he had good movement," Orioles manager Dave Trembley said. "With due respect, I thought both pitchers benefited from the time the game started. The batters were having a hard time seeing the ball."	Game notes	Millwood hasn't lost to Baltimore since May 2006. He has allowed eight earned runs over 44 innings (1.64 ERA) in his winning streak over the Orioles. ... The doubleheader started under sunny, clear skies. While the wind was near 20 mph and gusting, there were no other indications of the severe storms that moved through the area and forced the postponement of Wednesday night's game. ... Despite the bright sun, the infield was in the shadows and there was a seven-minute delay before the start of the eighth inning while waiting for the lights to come on. ... Hernandez, who entered the game in a 3-for-23 slump, was robbed of a second straight hit leading off the fourth when right fielder David Murphy made a running shoestring catch on the sinking liner.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

BOSTON (AP) -- When World Series MVP Mike Lowell went on the disabled list, his workload fell upon Kevin Youkilis and Sean Casey.	Youkilis, who moved across the diamond to third base, drove in two runs and scored twice and Casey had two hits and three RBIs on Thursday night to help the Red Sox forget about Lowell's injury and beat the Detroit Tigers 12-6.	Youkilis also fielded seven chances at third base flawlessly, including all three outs in the first inning, when he made a barehanded grab of Placido Polanco's bouncer.	"Youk put on a show defensively," said Lowell, who went on the 15-day DL with a sprained left thumb before the game. "And they both swung a pretty good bat."	J.D. Drew went 3-for-3 with two runs and two RBIs, and Tim Wakefield fluttered his knuckleball for five innings as the Red Sox supported him with three four-run innings. Each one came after the Tigers scored in the top half.	"That's always a no-no, when you score and you come right back and give them runs," said Detroit manager Jim Leyland, whose team lost for the eighth time in nine games. "That usually spells a long evening and we did that several times -- not only a run, but big runs."	Manny Ramirez had a two-run double and he also scored a run by ignoring a two-handed stop sign put up by third base coach DeMarlo Hale. Casey hit a two-run single in the four-run seventh to give Boston an 8-3 lead, but five straight Detroit batters reached base in the eighth off Julian Tavarez and cut the deficit to 8-6.	Tavarez got Gary Sheffield to hit into a run-scoring double play that cut the deficit to 8-6 before Jonathan Papelbon got Magglio Ordonez on a popup to center to end the eighth.	"It got a little hairy, and it wasn't very comfortable for me," Red Sox manager Terry Francona said. "When [Tavarez] got that double play, there was nobody happier in the ballpark than me."	The Red Sox added four in the eighth on a two-run double by Youkilis, Drew's sacrifice fly and an RBI single by Coco Crisp. Papelbon pitched a scoreless ninth for his third save in three tries.	The Tigers stranded six baserunners in the first three innings despite failing to get a hit off Wakefield (1-0). He walked five and hit two batters by the time he was done, allowing three hits and one earned run while striking out five to improve to 10-1 in his last 12 starts at Fenway.	Nate Robertson (0-1) allowed eight hits and two walks while striking out six in 5 1/3 innings, giving up all of his four runs in the fourth inning. Five Detroit pitchers combined to throw 212 pitches, allowing 13 hits and nine walks.	"There isn't a bullpen in the history of baseball that could help a team when the starters can only muster five innings every night," Leyland said. "That's where you start, and we'll worry about the bullpen after we get that straightened out."	Detroit's Ivan Rodriguez reached base all five times he came to the plate, with three singles, a walk and a hit-by-pitch.	The crowd of 37,612, boosted by the offseason addition of nearly 1,000 seats, was the most at Fenway since World War II.	Game notes	 The Red Sox celebrated "Japan Night," playing the Japanese national anthem before the game with Japanese dancers and drummers on the warning track. ... Drew has a hit in all seven games in which he's played. ... The Red Sox purchased the contract of Jed Lowrie from Triple-A Pawtucket to replace Lowell. ... Robertson is 1-3 with a 7.36 ERA in four Fenway starts. David Ortiz is just 3-for-22 against him, the worst numbers against any pitcher he has faced more than 20 times. ... Ortiz is in an 0-for-10 slump. He was the only Red Sox starter without a hit.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

PITTSBURGH (AP) -- After needing the equivalent of three games merely to win twice in Pittsburgh, what a relief this regulation game was to the Chicago Cubs. Almost as big as the relief Jon Lieber gave them.	Geovany Soto and Mike Fontenot hit two-run homers in Chicago's five-run sixth inning and the Cubs finished off a three-game sweep of Pittsburgh, winning 7-3 on Thursday night to run their winning streak to five games.	Soto had three extra-base hits, including two doubles, among his second career four-hit game, and Derrek Lee also drove in two runs despite not getting a hit as the Cubs won their sixth in a row over the Pirates dating to last season.	Lieber (2-1) got the decision by pitching 4 1/3 scoreless relief innings after starter Rich Hill needed 72 pitches to get through three innings, allowing three runs and three hits and walking four. Lieber pitched 7 1/3 scoreless relief innings in the series, three of them during a 10-8, 12-inning win Monday in the Pirates' home opener.	"Without Lieber, we really would have had problems," manager Lou Piniella said. "We were looking for innings. ... [Hill] was all over the place. There was no use keeping him in there. It wasn't going to get any better."	The Cubs certainly didn't need to look for innings earlier in the series.	After going 12 and 15 innings to win the first two games -- the first time in 81 years they've needed that many innings to win consecutive road games -- the Cubs won this with one big inning against the pitching-thin Pirates, who dropped their fifth in six games.	"I'm glad it didn't go [extra innings]," said Soto, who went 8-of-17 while catching all 36 innings in the series -- apparently with no effect on his offense.	The Cubs withstood two Pirates homer-driven comebacks to win 6-4 in 15 innings on Wednesday night.	"I think any situation like that, if anybody can go in there and do that, it's definitely huge," Lieber, a converted starter, said of propping up the bullpen. "You want to give those guys a break down there, especially after last night's ballgame."	Soto had a chance to hit for the cycle, but he didn't think of trying to stretch a double into a triple in the seventh. He grounded out in the ninth.	"I already hit my one [triple] for the year. I'll take them if they come, but I don't want to get greedy," Soto said. "I'm not a triple-type guy."	After emptying their bullpen in consecutive games, the Pirates needed a lot of innings from starter Matt Morris (0-1), who lasted seven but gave up 11 hits and seven runs, four earned.	"I tried to avoid thinking about that all day -- the obvious thing is [to think], 'I've got to go eight, I've got to go nine, I've got to go seven, whatever it is,' and as soon as you start thinking like that, you can barely get out of the first," Morris said.	Morris led 3-2 going into the sixth but quickly fell behind when Kosuke Fukudome walked and Soto followed with a drive into the center field shrubbery for his second homer.	"I had the game in front of me but, all of a sudden, the home run just changed everything and it snowballed," Morris said.	Morris might have gotten out of the inning with only two runs scoring, but Ryan Theriot, who had singled, was safe at third on a steal attempt when third baseman Jose Bautista dropped Ronny Paulino's throw that arrived well ahead of the runner.	Theriot scored on Reed Johnson's single, and Fontenot made it 7-3 with a two-run, two-out drive into the right field seats, the third homer off Morris in two starts.	Xavier Nady and Bautista hit sacrifice flies in Pittsburgh's three-run first inning.	Game notes	 The Cubs scored at least six runs in every game of the series and have scored 35 runs in their last five games. ... Chicago's winning streak is its longest since winning seven in a row last June 22-29. ... The Cubs had as many extra-inning victories (two) in the series as they did last season, when they were 2-8 when playing more than nine innings. ... Until this series, Chicago hadn't won back-to-back road games of more than 12 innings since 1927, when they beat Boston in 18 innings (May 14) and 22 innings (May 17). ... Soto also had a four-hit game against the Cardinals on Sept. 16. ... Morris has lost six of his last seven decisions against the Cubs and seven of his last nine after starting his career 10-2 against them.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

TORONTO (AP) -- Travis Buck has found his stroke, and the Oakland Athletics are on a roll.	Buck doubled home two runs in the 12th inning and the Athletics completed a three-game sweep of the Toronto Blue Jays with a 3-2 win Thursday night.	Buck went 3-for-6 with three RBIs, matching an Oakland record with three doubles.	"We're very confident right now," Buck said. "The Blue Jays aren't going to get swept too many times this year, let alone here."	After starting the season in an 0-for-22 slump, Buck doubled in the second inning Tuesday and ended up going 7-for-16 with four RBIs and six doubles in the series, boosting his average to .189. The six doubles in a three-game series are an Oakland record.	"I just got that first hit out of the way two games ago and started going back to being myself," Buck said. "No matter how good you are, when you're in a slump like that you start to think about it a little bit. You've just got to keep on doing what you did you get to this level, don't change a thing."	The Athletics have won four of six overall, and seven straight in Toronto in a streak that began during the 2007 season.	"The way these three games went and the way we battled all the way to the end and came out on top, everybody did their job this series," Buck said. "We're very proud and we've got to continue it."	Chris Denorfia led off the A's 12th with a single, Bobby Crosby grounded out and Jack Hannahan was intentionally walked before Brandon League (0-1) loaded the bases by hitting Kurt Suzuki. Denorfia was forced out at home on Emil Brown's infield grounder before Buck doubled to left-center.	"He (League) wasn't throwing the split-finger for strikes," Buck said. "We were just going up there looking for the fastball."	The winner was right-hander Joey Devine (1-0), who worked two innings after being recalled from Triple-A Sacramento earlier in the day when Rich Harden landed on the 15-day disabled list.	Devine almost missed the start of the game after his connecting flight to Toronto was delayed by a snowstorm in Denver. He finally arrived at Rogers Centre about 20 minutes before the first pitch.	"I got here in one piece and was able to be a part of an unbelievable baseball game," Devine said. "It's just one of those things where you've got to get what you did previously in the day out of your head and mentally block it off."	Devine's effort made an impact on his new teammates.	"He did an outstanding job," Buck said. "I don't think too many guys could have done that."	Hannahan made the defensive play of the game with one out and runners at second and third in the ninth. With the infield in, third baseman Hannahan dived to his left to snare a hard grounder off the bat of Marco Scutaro, looked the runners back and got the out at first.	"The play Jack Hannahan made really saved the game," Oakland manager Bob Geren said. "It looked like a hit and he just took it away."	Shortstop Bobby Crosby called Hannahan's play "incredible."	"It was real impressive," Crosby said. "If he doesn't make that play, we lose."	Keith Foulke gave up an RBI single to Vernon Wells in the bottom of the 12th but got Aaron Hill to ground into a game-ending 6-4-3 double play, picking up his first save of the season.	The Blue Jays, who swept a three-game series from Boston last weekend, head to Texas for three this weekend.	"We're going to see what we're made of," Jays outfielder Vernon Wells said. "We haven't played well there for as long as I've been here. If we don't start playing better baseball, the same thing is going to happen to us there."	Oakland opened the scoring in the fifth when Ryan Sweeney singled with two outs and came around on Buck's double to right-center. Toronto tied it in the eighth against reliever Alan Embree. Scutaro led off with a triple and scored one out later on Shannon Stewart's sacrifice fly.	Athletics left-hander Dana Eveland scattered three hits over 6 1/3 shutout innings, lowering his ERA to 0.68. He walked three and struck out six. Blue Jays right-hander Shaun Marcum allowed one run on six hits in seven innings, walking one and striking out eight.	Game notes	 Harden (strained back muscle) was placed on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to April 3, and will miss his scheduled start at Cleveland on Saturday. Left-hander Lenny DiNardo is expected to start in his place. ... Toronto DH Frank Thomas went 0-for-4 with four strikeouts and two walks. ... Toronto Raptors rookie Jamario Moon threw out the first pitch. ... The Athletics' team record for doubles in a game is four by Frankie Hayes of the Philadelphia A's in 1936.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

NEW YORK (AP) -- Two nights in a row the New York Mets proved they can beat Philadelphia -- at least when Jimmy Rollins is on the bench.	Jose Reyes scored the winning run with a slick slide at the plate on Angel Pagan's 12th-inning single, and New York outlasted the Phillies 4-3 Thursday night.	With last year's NL East champions missing their MVP shortstop, the Mets won the final two of a three-game series after losing nine straight to Philadelphia -- including the final eight meetings in 2007.	"The way that we won I think gives us some momentum and hopefully we can use that going forward," David Wright said. "Everything was extremely negative after that first loss. To come and take this series after dropping that first one hopefully gives us some confidence."	Ryan Howard and Pedro Feliz homered for the Phillies, who scored twice in the eighth off struggling setup man Aaron Heilman to tie it at 3 and spoil a strong outing by Mets starter John Maine.	With two outs in the 12th, Reyes doubled off Tom Gordon (0-2) and Pagan grounded a sharp single to center for his third hit.	Jayson Werth's strong throw home made it a surprisingly close play on the speedy Reyes, who slid around catcher Chris Coste and appeared to touch the plate with his left hand just before Coste applied the tag.	Plate umpire Ted Barrett immediately signaled safe, and Phillies manager Charlie Manuel popped out of the dugout for a brief argument as the Mets celebrated nearby.	"Safe, yes," Reyes said. "He hit the ball hard and they were playing kind of shallow. He made a perfect throw. It made the play closer than I thought."	After watching the replay, the Phillies disagreed with the call.	"The guy was out," Manuel said. "He didn't make it. Maybe Ted wanted to go home. He told me he got there first. Maybe he ought to go look at it."	Rollins was missing from the starting lineup for the second consecutive game because of a sprained left ankle. He struck out as a pinch hitter against Billy Wagner leading off the ninth.	Mets reliever Scott Schoeneweis entered to boos with two on in the 11th, then got Chase Utley to ground into an inning-ending double play and gave a huge first pump as he walked off the mound.	Jorge Sosa (1-0) retired Feliz with one pitch in the 12th to earn the win. The Phillies stranded 13 runners for a total of 35 in the series.	"We had plenty of opportunities. We left a lot of guys on base. We didn't get it done when we had to," Manuel said.	The Phillies rallied and played errorless ball one night after a sloppy performance without Rollins. Eric Bruntlett filled in at shortstop again after making two of Philadelphia's four errors Wednesday night -- both in a six-run third inning.	With two on and none out in the 11th on Thursday, Bruntlett struck out trying to bunt.	Maine took a 3-0 lead into the seventh before giving up a leadoff homer to Feliz, his first with the Phillies, and Coste's double off the left-field fence.	Pedro Feliciano pitched New York out of a jam with three straight strikeouts, but Heilman squandered the lead in the eighth.	Howard opened the inning with a 450-foot shot to center, his second home run of the season. Pat Burrell walked and pinch-runner So Taguchi went to third on Geoff Jenkins' single. Feliz drove in the tying run with a slow groundout before Heilman escaped further damage.	Ryan Church's two-run single with two outs in the fourth put New York ahead, and Carlos Beltran added an RBI single off Adam Eaton in the sixth. Pagan also doubled and scored twice in another fine game while filling in for injured left fielder Moises Alou.	"Angel Pagan has done a great job for us," manager Willie Randolph said. "He's a high-energy guy. He's playing with a little confidence right now. He had a great spring. He's been in the middle of a lot of things going on the last week or so."	Eaton is 5-0 with a 2.90 ERA in eight starts against the Mets, including 4-0 with a 3.08 ERA in six starts at Shea Stadium. Maine is 4-0 with a 2.05 ERA in seven starts against Philadelphia.	Game notes	 Wagner also fanned Howard in a hitless ninth. Wagner's only other appearance this season was April 2. ... Reyes and Wright pulled off a double steal in the eighth. It was Reyes' first stolen base since Sept. 15. The 22-game drought was the longest of his career. ... With nobody left on the bench besides regular catcher Carlos Ruiz, Manuel used pitcher Cole Hamels as a pinch hitter in the 11th and sent him up to bunt. Hamels got a bunt single when catcher Brian Schneider slipped as he picked up the ball. It was the first pinch-hit by a Phillies pitcher since Omar Olivares hit a two-run homer against Colorado on July 24, 1995.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Now the Baltimore Orioles have a streak they don't want to extend.	The surprising O's (6-3), still tied for the American League's best record, had their six-game winning streak -- already matching their longest of last season -- abruptly ended Thursday in a doubleheader sweep by the Texas Rangers.	"It's a long day," manager Dave Trembley said. "It's much longer when you lose."	Especially late in games.	Ian Kinsler hit a tiebreaking RBI single in the eighth inning of the nightcap for a 5-4 victory, right after the Orioles had overcome a three-run deficit. The second baseman then had a nifty stop to deny pinch-hitter Luke Scott a hit in the ninth, when C.J. Wilson worked another perfect inning for his second save of the day.	The Rangers won the opener 3-1 after scoring twice in the seventh.	With Baltimore and Kansas City leading the AL, the Rangers (5-4) are over .500 for the first time under second-year manager Ron Washington. They started 2-4 last season and were already out of contention after a 20-loss May.	"It's feels great. It's something we've been thinking about," Wilson said. "Especially with the start we got off to last year when we were spinning our wheels and sinking."	Kinsler's hit was a hard shot that shortstop Luis Hernandez couldn't backhand, and the third consecutive one-out single against Chad Bradford (0-1). That scored Ben Broussard, who had moved up to third on Adam Melhuse's hit	Jamey Wright (1-0) worked 2 1/3 innings in relief of starter Kason Gabbard before Wilson pitched his second 1-2-3 inning of the day for his third save of the season.	"Our pitching has been incredible," shortstop Michael Young said. "They've been leading the way for us. ... We know we have a lot of guys capable of doing special things."	In the opener, Kevin Millwood (1-2) allowed one run in seven innings to lower his ERA to 1.29 and finally get a victory to show for his solid pitching this season. Joaquin Benoit then struck out three of the four batters he faced before their left-handed closer took over.	Young, who scored twice in the opener, hit a solo homer in the first inning of the nightcap. Milton Bradley had a two-run double and David Murphy an RBI single in the third off Adam Loewen for a 4-1 lead.	The Orioles overcome that deficit on Jay Payton's two-out, two-run homer in the sixth that chased Gabbard, and an RBI groundout by Kevin Millar that tied it in the eighth.	"I felt like everybody on the team did their job except me," said Loewen, the left-hander pitching a day after his 24th birthday. "We have a solid team, solid all the way around. We're going to rebound from this pretty quickly."	Gabbard, who threw seven scoreless innings in his first start at the Los Angeles Angels, left with a 4-3 lead after the last of his 101 pitches was the homer by Payton. Gabbard, who turned 26 on Tuesday, allowed seven hits with one strikeout and two walks.	Millwood was coming off a complete-game 2-1 loss, after losing the season opener despite giving up only two unearned runs, before winning his sixth straight start against the Orioles.	"We need him to lead this pitching staff, and he's doing that," Washington said.	"To have something to show for it is awfully nice," Millwood said.	Texas scored only one run for Millwood in each of his first two starts, both on the road. It was 1-1 against the Orioles after the right-hander had thrown the last of his 111 pitches, but Texas scored twice in the seventh on Young's RBI single and a sacrifice fly by Josh Hamilton.	The Orioles had only three hits against Millwood, including an RBI single by Ramon Hernandez. Millwood struck out two and overcame five walks, one short of his career high.	"I wasn't throwing where I wanted to. Hopefully, it was just one of those days," he said. "I felt like I was able to make a few pitches when I needed to."	Kinsler started the go-ahead rally with a one-out single off Steve Trachsel (1-1). Kinsler then stole second and scored on Young's single. Young also stole second and went to third on catcher Hernandez's throw into center field before Hamilton's sacrifice fly -- the second time he drove in Young.	Trachsel gave up three runs and five hits over 6 1/3 innings, leaving after Young's single. The 37-year-old right-hander struck out two and walked four.	"Both starting pitchers were on their game. Trachsel made some great pitches. Millwood is a crafty veteran, and he had good movement," Trembley said. "With due respect, I thought both pitchers benefited from the time the game started. The batters were having a hard time seeing the ball."	Game notes	 The Rangers honored public address announcer Chuck Morgan for working his 2,000th consecutive game, the first of the doubleheader. Except for 2002 when he worked in Kansas City, all of those games have been in Texas since 1983. ... Millwood hasn't lost to Baltimore since May 2006. He's allowed eight earned runs over 44 innings (1.64 ERA) in that winning streak. ... The doubleheader started under sunny, clear skies. While the wind was near 20 mph and gusting, there were no other indications of the severe storms that moved through the area and forced the postponement of Wednesday night's game.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Once again, Andy Pettitte came up big when the New York Yankees needed a win.	Pettitte picked up his first victory and Alex Rodriguez and Melky Cabrera each homered and drove in two runs, helping the New York Yankees defeat the Kansas City Royals 6-1 Thursday night and avoid a series sweep.	"Andy knows how to win big games," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "I don't know if I would call this a big game, but you don't want to be swept at the start of an eight-game road trip."	Pettitte (1-1) held the Royals to one run and five hits in 6 2-3 innings, and is 7-0 in his past nine starts against them. He has a career record of 12-4 with a 3.06 ERA against Kansas City, which is his best earned run average against any American League club.	After throwing 31 pitches in the first inning, when the Royals managed their only run off him, Pettitte needed just 61 pitches through the next 5 2/3 innings.	"I didn't have much at all the first couple of innings," Pettitte said. "I was extremely fortunate to get through that, thank goodness. ... My command was extremely bad early on and I was just very fortunate to get away with some balls I left over the plate.	"I really just started feeling good midway through the third inning and felt like I got into a really good rhythm. ... That was good to see, hopefully I can carry this one into my next one."	Cabrera tied the game at 1 with a solo homer in the third, driving a 1-2 pitch to left off John Bale, the first left-hander the Yankees have faced this year.	The Yankees seized a 2-1 lead in the fourth when Jorge Posada, who led off the inning with a single and advanced to third on Hideki Matsui's base hit, scored when Jose Molina grounded into a double play.	Cabrera and Rodriguez each had an RBI in the fifth. Cabrera's single scored Morgan Ensberg, and Johnny Damon scored on Rodriguez's fielder's choice grounder after his own infield single.	"Everyone contributed tonight," Girardi said. "That's how you want your offfense to work."	Rodriguez and Posada added back-to-back home runs in the ninth off Hideo Nomo, who replaced Bale for his first appearance in the majors since July 15, 2005, while with Tampa Bay.	"Our team desparately needed a win today," Rodriguez said. "We're on the road. We lost two tough games. It's good to sneak one out here and go into Boston with some momentum."	Nomo, who is making a comeback at 39 and after having elbow surgery in 2006, worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the seventh. He then got through the eighth without any damage before giving up the homers to Rodriguez and Posada with two out in the ninth.	Rodriguez increased his career RBI total to 1,510, moving him one ahead of Mickey Mantle and into 45th place on the all-time list. His home runs was his 175th as a Yankee, tying whim for 19th on the Yankees all-time list.	"The good thing about passing guys like Murcer and Mantle is that I'm passing them and they're not passing me," Rodriguez said. "That means I'm still wearing pinstripes."	Bale (0-2) left after six innings, allowing four runs and eight hits with a walk while striking out three.	"John hasn't had a lot of run support," Royals manager Trey Hillman said. "Nomo got hit hard in his last inning of work. He said he felt fine after the eighth. He maintained his velocity."	Jose Guillen's two-out double in the first scored Mark Teahen for the Royals' only run.	The Yankees, who were 1-for-13 with runners in scoring position in the first two games of the series, went 2-for-8 on Thursday night. They are 13-for-74 with runners in scoring position in the first 10 games of the season.	Game notes	 The Yankees have gone 10 games into the season without a stolen base for the first time since 1948, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. In 1948, they didn't have any until a double-steal by Phil Rizzuto and Tommy Henrich in New York's 17th game. ... Rain delayed the game twice for a total of 28 minutes. ... Royals DH Billy Butler singled in the seventh to extend his hitting streak to nine games.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Kevin Correia's latest start became all the more impressive considering his current state of health.	Down 12 pounds to 188 because of a stomach bug last week, Correia didn't let it show that he's still a little weak and trying to regain his strength.	He carried a shutout into the eighth inning in one of his best starts yet, leading the San Francisco Giants past the St. Louis Cardinals 5-1 on Thursday night for their third straight victory.	"My body is still taxed," Correia said. "My velocity was a little down. But I got a lot of quick outs. ... I got behind some guys but I made some good pitches and made the right pitches at the right times to make it a pretty good outing."	Correia (1-1) allowed five hits in 7 2/3 innings, struck out four, walked two and also singled for the Giants, who are on a little roll after losing six of their first seven games.	Fred Lewis doubled, tripled and scored twice and Randy Winn added a sacrifice fly for San Francisco, which went 19 innings without allowing a run before Troy Glaus' ninth-inning RBI double off Brad Hennessey ended the Giants' shutout bid.	Lewis will be called upon regularly now in left field. The Giants announced after the game that outfielder Dave Roberts will undergo left knee surgery Saturday and could miss significant time.	Manager Bruce Bochy feels comfortable batting Lewis almost anywhere in the order, seeing quite the exhibition of speed with him hitting leadoff Thursday. Lewis might have had a little extra motivation: His teammates fined him $12 for wearing his black uniform belt with a baby blue suit a night earlier. He forgot his own belt at home.	"I hate that Dave's out," Lewis said. "He's one of my teammates. It means I'm going to get a lot of playing time and hopefully help the team get as many wins as possible."	Correia, a full-time starter for the first time after primarily relieving in parts of five previous major league seasons, beat the Cardinals for the first time in eight career outings. He left to a standing ovation after allowing Skip Schumaker's two-out double that followed a single by Cesar Izturis.	Correia felt some cramping in his left arm that forced his hand into a fist -- he figures it was a result of still being dehydrated from the illness -- after a pitch to pinch-hitter Aaron Miles. Correia was checked on by the Giants' training staff and needed help getting his glove back on but stayed in the game, then gave way to Jack Taschner after the double. Taschner got pinch-hitter Ryan Ludwick to fly out.	Hennessey recorded the first out in the ninth before Brian Wilson entered with runners on first and second and finished for his second save in three chances. He struck out pinch-hitter Rico Washington looking to end it.	Correia allowed only four baserunners past first, including on Izturis' third-inning double that he tried to stretch into a triple only to be thrown out. The pitcher's seventh-inning single was his first hit since April 30, 2007, and the seventh of his career.	St. Louis had won seven of eight since a season-opening loss to Colorado, but the Cardinals couldn't do much offensively in their first game of the year away from Busch Stadium. They opened a four-game series in the Giants' waterfront ballpark.	Adam Wainwright (1-1) allowed four runs and eight hits, struck out six and didn't walk a batter in seven innings. After Lewis led off the third inning with a triple to right, Wainwright retired the next 12 batters he faced before giving up two doubles to start the seventh.	"I wasn't giving singles up, I was giving up doubles and a triple," Wainwright said. "They're all balls that were up. I deserve that loss tonight. Our team didn't but I did."	The Giants added a pair of insurance runs on back-to-back doubles by Jose Castillo and Ray Durham to start the inning, followed by Rich Aurilia's RBI single. That gave Aurilia, in his second stint with the club, 1,092 hits as a Giant to tie him with Matt Williams for ninth in San Francisco history.	Aurilia was caught stealing moments later. Bengie Molina singled in a run in the eighth.	His brother, Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina, went 0-for-3 with a walk and had his seven-game hitting streak snapped.

BOSTON (AP) -- Chien-Ming Wang did much more than overshadow his past failures at Fenway Park.	The Yankees' top starter shut down the Red Sox on just two hits -- a homer that nearly was caught and a bunt -- in the only park in which he had a losing record where he made more than one start.	Wang also improved against Boston's best hitters in New York's 4-1 win Friday night.	Manny Ramirez began the game 13-for-22 against Wang and David Ortiz was 15-for-30. But they were hitless in six at bats with three strikeouts and a double play.	"I felt especially good about this because I threw the ball well here in Boston and never pitched well here," Wang said through a translator.	Not bad for a pitcher who was 2-3 with a 6.17 ERA at Fenway Park before the game.	Wang (3-0) struck out three, walked none and needed just 93 pitches in the first Yankees-Red Sox game of the season. He allowed only J.D. Drew's homer in the fifth inning and Coco Crisp's two-out bunt single in the ninth.	"His sinker was outstanding," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "He was at the top of his game."	Wang allowed only one other runner, on an error. In his previous start, the sinkerballer went six innings in the Yankees' 2-0 win over Tampa Bay.	"You see fly balls, you think the results would be different," Boston manager Terry Francona said. "He was very efficient."	The Red Sox hit a lot of line drives and deep fly balls, and Yankees outfielders had 12 putouts.	They nearly had 13, but Drew's deep drive grazed the top of right fielder Bobby Abreu's glove and landed in Boston's bullpen for a homer that made it 1-all.	"I just didn't find the wall very well," Abreu said. "When I was making my jump, I banged myself into the wall. I hit my shoulder. It hit my glove. I should have caught it."	Jason Giambi, 1-for-22 before hitting a tiebreaking homer in the seventh, has had some tough luck on balls he's hit well.	"They hit a lot of balls hard, but they didn't get a lot of hits," he said. "When they hit the ball hard, it was right at somebody. I know that feeling. I've been swinging the bat good, but I just didn't get a lot of hits."	The traditional powers in the AL East were missing some significant figures in the rivalry.	For the Yankees, Joe Torre had ended 12 years as manager when he walked away from a one-year offer, and captain Derek Jeter was sidelined with a strained left thigh. For the Red Sox, 2004 World Series star Curt Schilling and 2007 Series MVP Mike Lowell are on the disabled list.	And Ortiz is off to a horrible start at 3-for-39.	Giambi gave New York a 2-1 lead with a leadoff homer in the seventh off Mike Timlin (0-1). Jose Molina then doubled, took third on Alberto Gonzalez's sacrifice and scored on Melky Cabrera's sacrifice fly.	Timlin was activated Friday from the disabled list where he started the season with a cut on his right ring finger	"It was terrible, absolutely terrible," he said. "I came back, pitched terrible. It's not how I was looking forward to opening up 2008."	Abreu singled in the final run in the ninth.	Wang retired the first 10 batters before Dustin Pedroia hit a hard grounder down the third-base line. Alex Rodriguez made an outstanding backhand stop, but his off-balance throw was high, forcing Giambi to jump for it and allowing Pedroia to cross the bag just before the first baseman landed on it. It was ruled an error.	The first two batters in the fifth flied out to Abreu in deep right. Drew followed with another high fly to right and Abreu kept drifting back.	He reached back with his right hand for the low wall, touched the top, then bumped into it.	"A lot of things [were] going through my mind," Abreu said. "I was thinking, 'if I catch the ball it's going to be a different game.' "	Wang retired the side by getting Jason Varitek to hit a long fly to center, then breezed through the next three perfect innings and set down the first two batters in the ninth. After Crisp reached on a bunt, Pedroia lined out to left.	New York had taken a 1-0 lead on Molina's RBI double in the fifth off Clay Buchholz, who pitched a no-hitter in his last Fenway outing on Sept. 1, his second major league start.	Game notes	 Varitek turned 36 Friday. ... Drew has hit in all eight of his games. ... The crowd of 37,624 set a single-game record for Fenway Park since World War II. The previous record of 37,612 was set one night earlier against Detroit. The capacity of the park was expanded in the offseason. ... Exactly one year earlier, Seattle's Felix Hernandez pitched a one-hitter in Daisuke Matsuzaka's first start at Fenway Park, a 3-0 Mariners' win.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

CLEVELAND (AP) -- C.C. Sabathia wanted no distractions this season, putting contract negotiations on hold until after it's over.	The reigning AL Cy Young winner is bringing them on himself anyway.	Sabathia gave up nine runs and 12 hits in his shortest outing in nearly two years, and the Oakland Athletics held on to beat the Cleveland Indians 9-7 on Friday night.	"It's definitely frustrating, not being able to go out and do your job," said Sabathia, who requested during spring training that negotiations be tabled so he could focus on pitching.	"I just [stink] right now and [am] not making good pitches," Sabathia said. "I feel great, so there's no excuses."	Sabathia (0-2) was pulled after 3 1/3 innings, but by then Mark Ellis, Mike Sweeney and Donnie Murphy had all driven in two runs apiece. It was Sabathia's shortest start since yielding nine runs in 2 1/3 innings to the Chicago Cubs on June 21, 2006.	"I've been here before," Sabathia said of his struggles. "I will get this turned around."	Joe Blanton (1-2) allowed eight hits and five runs over 7 2/3 innings to win for the first time in six starts since last Sept. 15. The right-hander walked one, struck out one and was helped by two double plays. Huston Street worked 1 1/3 innings for his third save.	Street got the final out in the eighth after Cleveland scored six runs off four pitchers in an inning that was interrupted by rain for 59 minutes.	Sabathia was 19-7 with a 3.21 ERA last season, becoming Cleveland's first Cy Young winner since Hall of Famer Gaylord Perry in 1972. But the start of this season has been dreadful: He has an 11.57 ERA in 14 innings over three starts, losing twice in one week to Oakland.	"That's not an easy feat against someone as good as he is," Oakland manager Bob Geren said. "Every hitter in the lineup got a hit and a couple guys who haven't played much contributed."	Sabathia's third straight poor start -- fifth in a row if two terrible outings against Boston in last fall's AL Championship Series are included -- had Cleveland fans booing the left-hander.	It came one night after the Indians signed right-hander Fausto Carmona through 2014, a move made in case they can't keep Sabathia, who rejected the club's preliminary offer over the winter. He is eligible for free agency in the fall.	The A's came in hitting .192 against lefties, but went 12-for-19 (.632) against Sabathia, whose career record against them fell to 2-7 with a 6.84 ERA.	"The way I was tonight, it could have been any team and the result would have been the same," Sabathia said.	Sweeney had an RBI single in the first and sacrifice fly in the second, when Oakland accumulated two walks, three singles, three doubles and five runs.	"It was tough to come into the dugout after that and see the whole team deflated," Sabathia said. "I feel bad."	Jhonny Peralta hit his third homer in the bottom half to make it 6-1.	Indians center fielder Grady Sizemore robbed Ellis of extra bases with a leaping catch at the wall in the third, but the sacrifice fly made it 7-1.	Sabathia left in the fourth with two on and one out. Reliever Jorge Julio struck out Jack Cust, but yielded a two-run single to Murphy.	Jason Michaels and Travis Hafner had RBI singles, Peralta a bases-loaded walk, Ryan Garko a two-run double and a run scored on a wild pitch by Street in the Indians' eighth.	"It would've been great to pick up C.C.," Garko said. "He's not going to have too many days like this."	Game notes	 There is speculation the Indians might move their Triple-A team from Buffalo after this season for a new ballpark being in built in Columbus. GM Mark Shapiro said only that a decision would be made in the fall. ... Indians RHP Paul Byrd expressed relief at the amnesty granted players implicated in the Mitchell Report. He admitted last fall to using HGH for a medical condition. ... Oakland C Travis Buck sat out with shin splints. ... Crosby has reached base in all 11 games. ... Sweeney improved his career average against Cleveland to .311 (148-for-476) with 24 homers and 94 RBIs in 132 games.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Tired of getting hit around, Brett Myers knew he needed to make a change. The Chicago Cubs saw the difference.	Myers pitched eight strong innings and Pat Burrell hit a tiebreaking double in the sixth inning, helping the Philadelphia Phillies end Chicago's five-game winning streak with a 5-3 victory Friday night.	Burrell also ripped a two-run homer off Carlos Zambrano.	Myers (1-1) allowed three runs on solo homers to earn his first win since moving back into the starting rotation. He gave up five hits and struck out five.	"I definitely felt a lot more aggressive," Myers said. "I felt I threw pitches with conviction instead of lollipopping them up there."	Derrek Lee, Aramis Ramirez and Alfonso Soriano connected off Myers, who finished last season as Philadelphia's closer.	The Phillies won without shortstop Jimmy Rollins for the first time in three tries. The 2007 NL MVP hasn't been in the starting lineup since he sprained his left ankle Tuesday.	Brad Lidge pitched a scoreless ninth for his second save.	Zambrano (1-1) gave up five runs and nine hits in six innings. He pitched on regular rest, even though he moved up a day after Jason Marquis was scratched Thursday because of illness.	"He didn't really throw all that well," Cubs manager Lou Piniella said. "He wasn't overpowering."	Ryan Howard lined a double to left-center to start the bottom of the sixth against Zambrano. Burrell, trying to hit the ball the opposite way to move Howard, ripped an RBI double to right field to put the Phillies ahead 4-3. Carlos Ruiz added an RBI single to make it 5-3.	Burrell is batting .519 (14-for-27) with six homers and 12 RBIs in his last nine games against the Cubs. He leads the Phillies with four homers and 12 RBIs this season.	If Rollins doesn't return soon, Burrell needs to continue his hot-hitting. When Chase Utley missed a month last season, Burrell picked up the offensive slack. He had eight homers and 21 RBIs in the 28 games Utley sat out with a broken hand.	"When guys get hurt, especially MVP-caliber guys, you have a hard time winning," Burrell said.	A questionable call allowed the Phillies to take a 3-2 lead in the fifth. After Shane Victorino drew a two-out walk, Greg Dobbs hit a drive that center fielder Kosuke Fukudome chased down in the alley. But Fukudome dropped the ball after running into left fielder Soriano and Dobbs was ruled safe, allowing Victorino to score on the double.	Piniella came out to argue because Fukudome took two steps before the ball fell out of his glove. He walked away scratching his head after listening to third base umpire Tim Welke's explanation.	"I did catch the ball," Fukudome said through an interpreter. "As I ran past Soriano, the tip of my glove hit his leg or torso. Once it popped out, there was nothing I could do."	Soriano made up for his gaffe by leading off the sixth with his second homer to tie it at 3.	Lee and Ramirez hit consecutive shots in the first inning to give the Cubs a 2-0 lead. Burrell's two-run homer tied it in the fourth. Burrell was 1-for-10 against Zambrano before he went deep.	"He's hitting the ball to right field with authority," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said. "He's swinging real good."	Zambrano was a better pitcher on the road than at home last year, going 12-4 with a 3.06 ERA outside Wrigley Field. After three starts, it's been the opposite this year.	Game notes	 Fukudome went 0-for-4. He had reached safely in his first nine games. ... Ramirez surpassed Mark Grace for 11th on the Cubs all-time list with his 149th homer since joining Chicago. It was his 500th career extra-base hit. ... The Phillies are 7-1 in the last eight games Myers has faced the Cubs.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Jason Bay homered high and deep into the left-field bleachers Friday night, and thought it might've been the longest ball he's hit at PNC Park.	Estimated at 432 feet, the sixth-inning drive lifted the Pittsburgh Pirates to a 1-0, rain-soaked win over the Cincinnati Reds.	"I don't want to say it's irrelevant talking about distance and how far it went, but it's more important that we got the home run and we got the win," Bay said.	Paul Maholm, John Grabow, Damaso Marte and Matt Capps combined on a seven-hit shutout. The Pirates ended a three-game losing streak and won for the first time at home this season.	Center fielder Nyjer Morgan made a leaping catch on the warning track in the gap -- avoiding a collision with right fielder Nate McLouth -- on a ball hit by Ken Griffey Jr. for the final out.	"I hate losing 1-0 games," Reds manager Dusty Baker said. "It won't take away the pain of losing tonight, but we're still getting good pitching. With good pitching, I feel we can win a bunch of games. I feel it coming."	The start of the game was delayed 20 minutes because of rain. There was another 62-minute delay in the top of the sixth when a severe thunderstorm hit that featured some heavy wind and hail.	With two outs in the bottom of that inning, Bay hit a full-count fastball from Jared Burton (0-1) for his second home run in the last three days.	"One bad pitch," said Burton, who has allowed only two hits -- both home runs -- in 6 2/3 innings this season. "You leave the ball up to a guy like Bay, he's not going to miss it too many times."	The Reds were shut out despite getting 14 runners. Brandon Phillips had two of the Reds' seven hits.	Maholm went 5 1/3 innings, allowing six hits and two walks with two strikeouts. He also hit a batter and committed an error to allow Norris Hopper to reach.	"It's not like they were blistering the ball all over the place," Maholm said. "They had some groundballs, I walked a couple guys, and it was just kind of about bearing down and concentrating on getting a groundball or getting a strikeout when you need it."	Grabow (1-0) emerged from the rain delay to work out of a two-on, one-out jam to earn the win. Marte induced Edwin Encarnacion to pop up with the bases loaded in the seventh, and Capps pitched a perfect ninth for his second save.	"We said all along if we can get deep into a game with a lead, we feel pretty good," Pirates manager John Russell said. "We've got some guys down there that are very capable of closing the game out. Marte did a great job, Grabow did another great job and then we turn it over to Capps and he does what he can do."	Reds starter Edinson Volquez allowed only three hits and three walks in five innings. He left after the long rain delay and Burton pitched the next two innings.	"We had our chances to score," Baker said. "We just couldn't get that one hit that we needed. Tonight was a bad outcome."	Game notes	 The Pirates' first homestand has featured long games. The team lost 12- and 15-inning contests against the Cubs this week. ... Reds C David Ross will continue his rehab at Triple-A Louisville. He missed most of spring training with back spasms and started the season on the 15-day DL. He began his rehab with the Reds' Florida State League team, going 2-for-11. ... McLouth was on base three times and extended his hitting streak to 10 games. He leads the majors in hits with 19 and has at least one in every game this season.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

NEW YORK (AP) -- Nelson Figueroa's young daughter climbed up on his lap at the podium, and his face lit up with the once-in-a-lifetime smile of someone who just lived out their boyhood dream.	Coming home never felt so good to Figueroa, who traveled around the world and back again for a chance to experience this very moment.	Pitching for his hometown team after four years of fighting to get back to the big leagues, Figueroa retired his first 14 batters and led the New York Mets to a 4-2 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers on a foggy Friday night at Shea Stadium.	"This journey has been so incredible," he said. "It's storybook."	Figueroa, who grew up a Mets fan in the same Coney Island projects as basketball star Stephon Marbury, tossed six savvy innings before a huge flock of family and friends to earn his first major league win since 2003.	After the final out, New York closer Billy Wagner gave the ball to Figueroa, who also took home the lineup card as a souvenir.	"I thought I was going to lose it," he said. "It was everything I dreamed it would be."	Carlos Delgado hit one of New York's three RBI singles and the Mets got a strong effort from their much-maligned bullpen to win their third consecutive game.	Prince Fielder and J.J. Hardy each had an RBI double for the Brewers, who dropped their third straight after opening 6-1.	Johan Santana makes his home debut Saturday for the Mets in a marquee matchup against Milwaukee ace Ben Sheets, who has started the year with 15 1/3 scoreless innings over two starts.	New York All-Star shortstop Jose Reyes came out after the fifth inning with tightness in his left hamstring and said he probably won't play Saturday.	"It's sore right now," Reyes said. "It's nothing big."	Once traded as part of a package for Curt Schilling, Figueroa was released by Pittsburgh on the day he had shoulder surgery in October 2004. He needed another follow-up operation, part of his long road back. But he was outstanding in his first big league start since September 2004.	"Give him credit. He threw the ball well. We hit some balls hard, but he pitched a good game," Milwaukee slugger Ryan Braun said.	After leaving nearly 100 tickets for family and friends on Dog Day at Shea Stadium, Figueroa threw consistent strikes and mixed his pitches well. Working exclusively from the stretch at the spring training suggestion of pitching coach Rick Peterson, the right-hander held the Brewers to two hits in six innings while striking out six and walking two.	His wife, Alysa, was in attendance, along with his parents. His father, Nelson Sr., wore his son's No. 27 jersey and a Mets cap while speaking with reporters in the corner of New York's clubhouse.	Figueroa and his family even slept at his parents' apartment Thursday night.	"Crowded," he said. "Wagner let me use his suite to stuff 'em all up there. It was an exciting night."	Figueroa's previous win in the majors came on Aug. 15, 2003, with Pittsburgh against Milwaukee.	Joe Smith and Aaron Heilman set up Wagner, who completed the two-hitter for his first save this season.	Brewers starter Manny Parra (1-1), who pitched a perfect game for Triple-A Nashville last June, allowed three runs and six hits in four innings.	Drafted by the Mets in 1995 out of Division III Brandeis University in Massachusetts, Figueroa (1-0) gives new meaning to the baseball phrase "journeyman." He pitched in Mexico, Taiwan and the Dominican Republic over the past year while trying to get back to the majors.	He was cut by New York on the final day of spring training, but called up from the minors on April 2 because of injuries to Pedro Martinez and Orlando Hernandez.	"My daughter's 4 and has more frequent-flyer miles than most people," said Figueroa, who turns 34 next month.	He retired 14 straight batters before issuing a four-pitch walk to Corey Hart with two outs in the fifth. Hardy followed with an RBI double, and Figueroa received a warm hand from the crowd.	The Brewers cut it to 3-2 in the sixth on Fielder's two-out RBI double, but Gold Glove center fielder Carlos Beltran ran down Braun's long drive to right-center to preserve the lead.	Beltran tracked the ball through the mist and fog for a difficult basket catch on the warning track. Figueroa raised his first in the air and waited by the dugout to thank Beltran.	"I never thought Beltran was going to catch that ball," Milwaukee manager Ned Yost said. "The air being heavy the way it was, we crushed some balls and it just died. That's smart pitching. Let your defense play the game for you."	Figueroa's batterymate also came full circle with the Mets on Friday night and gave them a lift. Raul Casanova, drafted by New York in 1990, made his first big league appearance for the team and hit an RBI single to make it 3-0 in the fourth.	The 35-year-old Casanova is filling in as the backup catcher while Ramon Castro (hamstring) is on the disabled list.	Game notes	 Mets reliever Duaner Sanchez (shoulder) pitched a scoreless inning for Triple-A New Orleans. ... The Brewers led in each of their first nine games. ... Figueroa (2000) and Casanova (2000-02) both played for the Brewers.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Carlos Pena is taking up where he left off last season.	The 2007 AL comeback player of the year homered twice and drew a bases-loaded walk in the eighth inning to finish with six RBIs Friday night, helping the Tampa Bay Rays rally for a 10-5 victory over the Baltimore Orioles.	"Hitting, winning. It's just contagious," Pena said after hitting his fourth and fifth homers of the season. "You flow with it, and today we swung the bat great."	The Rays slugger hit a two-run shot off Orioles starter Jeremy Guthrie in the first. He made it 5-all in the seventh with a three-run homer off left-hander Jamie Walker, who entered the game after Guthrie retired the first batter of the inning.	Pena, who hit 46 homers and drove in 121 runs last year, drew the bases-loaded walk off Dennis Sarfate (2-1) on a check swing that could have been called a third strike, putting Tampa Bay ahead 6-5.	The Rays broke it open with four more runs in the inning on B.J. Upton's two-run single, Eric Hinske's RBI double and Shawn Riggans' run-scoring single -- all off Greg Aquino, the fourth Baltimore pitcher.	"I'm sure he's applying a little bit of extra pressure to himself. I've been trying to talk to him about it to relax him in that regard," Rays manager Joe Maddon said of Pena, who signed a three-year contract worth $24,125,000 in January. "He's a very talented young man."	Al Reyes (1-1) got two outs for the win after being arrested early Friday at a Tampa bar and charged with being in a fight that disturbed the peace. He apologized for the incident, which occurred while celebrating his 38th birthday, and the Rays said before the game that he would not face disciplinary action.	"A long day. It was good to come up with a win," Reyes said.	"Whatever happened last night, I just forgot about that and tried to stay positive and focus on the game. I didn't want anything to affect the way I pitched."	Guthrie scattered eight hits over 6 1/3 innings. The right-hander, who lost to Tampa Bay on opening day, struck out four and walked one before being replaced by Walker with three left-handed batters in a row headed to the plate.	Akinori Iwamura reached on an infield single and Carl Crawford's pop fly dropped in shallow center field for his 1,000th career hit before Pena's second homer. Sarfate followed Walker and allowed three runs, one hit and four walks in one inning.	"I left it up for a guy who likes it that way. ... I wouldn't say they beat me -- I beat myself. It's a game we should've won," Sarfate said. "I wasn't going the whole year without a bad outing. I have to live with it."	Luke Scott's two-run double was the big blow off Rays starter James Shields (1-2) during Baltimore's three-run first. Brian Roberts had an RBI double in the second and Ramon Hernandez added a run-scoring single off Shields to make it 5-2 in the sixth.	Only two of the five runs scored off Shields were earned. Shortstop Jason Bartlett's two-out throwing error gave the Orioles their first run and Scott followed with his double into the gap in left-center field.	Crawford went 2-for-4 to become the eighth player since 1900 to reach 1,000 hits and 250 steals before his 27th birthday. Among active players, he's the ninth to get to 1,000 hits at age 26 or younger, joining Alex Rodriguez, Derek Jeter, Adrian Beltre, Ivan Rodriguez, Ken Griffey Jr., Albert Pujols, Andruw Jones and Vladimir Guerrero.	The Orioles have lost three straight following a six-game winning streak that had them off to their best start in a decade.	"It's not the end of the world," Sarfate said. "It's still early. ... We'll win tomorrow and forget about it."	Game notes	 Rays DH Cliff Floyd, out four to six weeks with a tear in his right knee, had surgery Friday. ... Orioles closer Chris Ray, who is rehabbing from right elbow surgery at Baltimore's minor league complex in nearby Sarasota, worked out with the team before the game. The right-hander had a long toss session, but has not thrown off a mound yet.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- It wasn't exactly a slight of hand, but Tim Hudson's pitching performance Friday night sure looked magical.	Hudson scattered three hits over eight innings, outpitching Matt Chico and helping the Atlanta Braves beat Washington 3-0 and send the Nationals to their eighth straight loss.	Hudson, who said he'd been suffering from a head cold for the last week, made all eight innings look easy, even though he admitted to running out of gas at the end.	"It was all I could do to get through that eighth, to be honest with you," he said. "I felt like I was Houdini out there."	Hudson (2-0) struck out five and walked two in improving to 6-1 all-time against the Nationals. Yunel Escobar hit a solo home run in the sixth inning, and the Braves added two runs in the ninth on a bases-loaded single by Matt Diaz.	Chico (0-2) gave Washington eight strong innings, allowing one run and five hits with a walk and three strikeouts. It was the longest outing of his career, but his only pitch to Escobar in the sixth inning cost him the game.	"That's the biggest thing for me," Chico said. "I gave up that run and we lost. It's my fault."	Chico made one mistake. Hudson didn't make any.	Only once did Hudson allow a baserunner to second -- Lastings Milledge advanced Cristian Guzman on a sacrifice bunt in the fourth inning.	Guzman had singled to lead off the fourth, and Hudson did not allow another hit until Austin Kearns singled in the seventh. Kearns was then caught stealing, a fitting end to the Nationals' only baserunner over the final four innings.	"Hudson pitched a great game tonight," said Nationals left fielder Willie Harris, who was 0-for-2. "I wouldn't say we beat ourselves. I'd say Hudson beat us tonight."	Peter Moylan retired the side in the ninth for his first save of the season. He said he was as impressed with Hudson's performance as anyone.	"I haven't seen [Hudson] fail yet," Moylan said. "It seems every game he's in he throws six, seven innings of shutout baseball. It's amazing to watch."	Escobar opened the scoring by barely clearing the out-of-town video scoreboard on the right field wall. His second homer of the year gave the Braves a 1-0 lead, a cushion that gave Hudson a little breathing room against Chico.	"I was excited," Hudson said. "[Chico] looked really good. He was putting up zeros, and it had the feel of one of those games going late into the game scoreless on both sides."	Other than the home run pitch, Chico was nearly as dominant as Hudson. He retired eight straight batters and 11 of 12 before Escobar's home run.	"[Chico] was nasty tonight," Diaz said. "We feel Tim Hudson right now is the best pitcher in baseball and he matched him pitch for pitch."	Chico's performance wasn't enough to end the Nationals' slide, though. Their eight game losing streak is the longest since also dropping eight straight from May 1-8, 2007.	Washington manager Manny Acta had called a closed-door meeting before the game to address the losing streak. During the meeting, Acta told his players that small errors were hurting them in close contests. It happened once again Friday night.	"The hits are going to start falling," Harris said. "We have to keep clawing, and it will get better."	Game notes	 Atlanta LHP Mike Hampton threw 40-50 pitches before the game and plans to throw again on Sunday. He's on the 15-day disabled list (left pectoral muscle). ... Washington RHP Chad Cordero pitched a perfect inning in his second rehab assignment for Class-A Potomac. Cordero, who's been on the 15-day disabled list (right shoulder tendenitis), said he threw just seven pitches and hopes to be reactivated in the next few days. ... Nationals 3B Ryan Zimmerman was 0-for-4. He's hitless in his last 16 at-bats. ... Washington 1B Dmitri Young had an epidural injection in his spine. He's on the 15-day disabled list with a lower back strain.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- This time, the Toronto Blue Jays got a little help from their hitters.	Lyle Overbay hit a three-run double, Vernon Wells drove in two runs and the Blue Jays ended a three-game losing streak with an 8-5 victory over the Texas Rangers on Friday night.	Four of Toronto's five defeats had been by one run, and the Blue Jays made things a little easier on their pitching and defense on Friday night with a 13-hit attack that included four stolen bases.	"The last three games, we haven't been as aggressive as we had been the first week," Wells said. "Once we got on base, we wanted to make things happen. We're not going to hit home runs all the time. Sometimes you have to manufacture runs."	Jesse Litsch (2-0) allowed two runs and six hits over 5 2/3 innings for the win. Toronto was swept at home by Oakland in a three-game series before opening a five-game road trip.	Scott Downs got two outs for his first save of the season.	Josh Hamilton homered and had a career-high four RBIs for the Rangers.	Texas starter Vicente Padilla (1-1) was perfect over the first three innings, but Toronto broke through for four runs in the fourth with four hits, a walk and some shaky Rangers defense.	"[Padilla] was tough those first couple of innings," Overbay said. "Then the was a walk and he missed some spots. It was a matter of taking advantage of it."	The Rangers, trying to go two games over .500 for the first time since they were 78-76 on Sept. 22, 2006, fell back to the break-even mark. They made three errors -- including two wild throws to second on steal attempts by catcher Gerald Laird -- and several mental mistakes.	"There were physical errors, we didn't cover first base on one play. We had a night where we threw the ball around," Rangers manager Ron Washington said.	Hank Blalock's first homer of the season, a solo drive in the second, put the Rangers in front.	Wells, who went 3-for-5, drew the Blue Jays even at 1 in the fourth with an RBI double off the glove of left fielder Frank Catalanotto. Toronto went on to load the bases, and Overbay cleared them with his double on a sharp grounder just inside the first-base line.	"If Cat makes the play, it's an outstanding play and maybe they only score one, but he didn't make it," Washington said.	Litsch worked out of a bases-loaded, two-out jam in the fourth when he retired Ben Broussard on a groundout.	"He wasn't very sharp, but he knows how to execute and make big pitches when he has to," Toronto manager John Gibbons said. "The kid's a winner."	Hamilton's sacrifice fly in the fifth pulled Texas within 4-2. Gregg Zaun scored on double steal in the Toronto sixth.	Hamilton hit a two-run homer in the seventh off reliever Brian Wolfe, a drive estimated at 436 feet that landed in the upper deck in right field.	But the Rangers were unable to pull closer than three, failing to follow up on a doubleheader sweep of the Baltimore Orioles on Thursday.	"We've got to play better and cleaner," Broussard said. "Today we played flat."	Game notes	 After the game, Toronto called up INF Joe Inglett from Triple-A Syracuse and optioned OF Buck Coates to Syracuse. ...The Rangers gave LHP C.J. Wilson the night off after he saved both ends of Thursday's doubleheader sweep. RHP Joaquin Benoit was to serve as the closer if Texas needed one. ... Toronto had lost 16 of its previous 19 games in Texas. ... Washington altered his rotation to give No. 4 starter Jason Jennings an extra day's rest. Jennings was due to start Sunday, but he'll be pushed back to Monday. Jennings is 0-2 with a 7.45 ERA in his first two starts this season. ... Texas will recall RHP Scott Feldman from Double-A Frisco to make his first major league start Sunday. Feldman, who has pitched in 73 career games as a reliever for the Rangers, was converted to a starter in spring training. ... The Rangers will have to make a move with their pitching staff to activate Saturday's scheduled starter, RHP Luis Mendoza. Mendoza will be making his first start of the season and fourth of his career.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

HOUSTON (AP) -- Jeremy Hermida doesn't like to think of himself as a home run hitter.	Like it or not, he and more than half the Florida Marlins starting lineup wore the title well Friday night when they set a team record with six home runs in a 10-6 win over struggling Roy Oswalt and the Houston Astros.	Hermida hit two of Florida's home runs and four other players connected.	Oswalt (0-3) gave up four home runs in a game for the first time in his career. Hermida had his first multihomer game in the majors.	Hermida said the team talked a lot in the spring about picking up the slack offensively with Miguel Cabrera gone to Detroit.	"With losing Miggy just the whole lineup had to step up," he said. "You can go through the lineup and see a lot of guys have done that so far. We have different guys contribute every night and that's what we need."	The Marlins previous record for homers was five. Florida has hit 20 in 10 games this season.	Oswalt allowed nine hits and eight runs in four innings. The three-time All-Star has struggled in each of his three starts this season, allowing a combined 30 hits and 17 runs.	He said he's concerned.	"Certainly I am. I have never went through this before," he said. "Hopefully it will change."	The five home runs he's given up this season are more than a third of the 14 he allowed last year.	Astros manager Cecil Cooper said Oswalt is healthy and he doesn't know why he's having trouble.	"If I knew I'd tell you. I have no clue. No clue," Cooper said. "Going into this game I thought it was his best stuff. I don't know what happened."	Houston led 3-0 before the Marlins scored five times in the third inning. Alfredo Amezaga hit an RBI single and Hermida's two-run homer tied it.	After Mike Jacobs singled, Jorge Cantu hit a home run that bounced off the railroad tracks in left field, giving Florida a 5-3 lead and eliciting boos from the home crowd.	"We hung in there and made him throw some balls over the plate and swung the bat pretty good," Marlins manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "I'm glad we got out of there with the win. It's tough to beat Roy."	Oswalt's problems continued in the fourth when Mike Rabelo, activated from the disabled list earlier in the day, led off with a home run. Pitcher Ricky Nolasco singled and Hanley Ramirez followed with a home run, making it 8-3 and drawing even louder and more spirited boos.	Hermida and Jacobs hit consecutive homers in the ninth inning.	Hermida said he never imagined they'd set the team record for home runs with Oswalt pitching.	"Definitely not," he said. "Roy Oswalt is one of the best pitchers in the game and his numbers aren't showing that this year but he's still one of the best. Every time you face him it's a tough day."	Lance Berkman hit his third home run of the season in the Houston fifth and Geoff Blum's two-run homer later in the inning made it 8-6.	Berkman had an RBI double in the first. Singles by Miguel Tejada and Blum and an error by Jacobs at first base put Houston ahead 3-0.	Nolasco (1-0) got the win in his first start of 2008 after two appearances in long relief. He allowed seven hits and five earned runs in five innings.	Nolasco hadn't started a game since May 17 and was put on the DL two days later with elbow inflammation.	"I was a little anxious there in the first," he said. "I tried to do a little too much a little too quickly, but I tried to settle down after that, and I was able to do that."
