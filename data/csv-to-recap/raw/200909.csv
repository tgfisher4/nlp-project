TORONTO -- Minnesota keeps failing to pressure Detroit in the AL Central.	Jose Bautista hit a solo homer, Brett Cecil won his final start of the season and the Toronto Blue Jays beat the Twins 3-2 Thursday.	"It's a game we needed to win, and we didn't do it," Morneau said. "That's why we're a .500 team."	Minnesota (70-70), which began the day 5 1/2 games back of the Tigers, has not won consecutive games since taking three in a row from Aug. 30-Sept. 1. The Twins went 1 for 9 with runners in scoring position Thursday and are averaging just 3.2 runs during their past 10 games.	"You give up three runs, you should have an opportunity to win," manager Ron Gardenhire said. "Unfortunately for us, our offense never could get anything going."	Minnesota is batting .237 (72 for 304) in September.	"I'm trying my best not to do everything, just to keep it simple still," designated hitter Jason Kubel said. "But given the circumstances, it's kind of hard not to go out there and try to win the game yourself."	The Twins begin a nine-game homestand Friday that starts with three each against struggling Oakland and Cleveland. They'll face the Tigers for three starting next Friday.	"We're just trying to hang on and try to gain some ground until we play Detroit," starter Scott Baker said. "We obviously don't have a lot of room to lose any more games, that's for sure."	The Twins also play a four-game series at Detroit from Sept. 28 to Oct. 1.	One night after the teams drew 11,159, the smallest crowd in the 20-year history of Rogers Centre, attendance was 11,461, the second-lowest this season. Toronto averaged 12,315 for the four-game series.	Minnesota's Joe Mauer went 0 for 4, dropping his major league-leading average to .363.	Cecil (7-4) allowed two runs and seven hits in six innings. Toronto is stopping his season after he pitched a combined 142 1/3 innings in the majors and at Triple-A.	"To finish like that, I still have a lot of stuff to work on but it's really good, really positive," Cecil said.	Jeremy Accardo, Jesse Carlson and Shawn Camp each got one out in the seventh, Scott Downs pitched the eight, and Jason Frasor finished for his eighth save in 10 chances.	"It all starts with pitching and Cecil pitched a good ball game for us," Blue Jays manager Cito Gaston said. "The guys came out of the bullpen and shut everything down."	As the Blue Jays headed to Detroit after the game, they dressed Cecil and nine other rookies in Toronto Argonauts cheerleaders costumes for the flight.	"This will be a first," Cecil said.	Baker (13-8) lost for the first time since July 7, giving up three runs, five hits and four walks in 6 2/3 innings. He had been 7-0 in his previous 11 starts.	"He still gave us a great chance to win, we just couldn't get any runs for him," Mauer said.	Toronto went ahead in the first when Joe Inglett walked and scored on Adam Lind's double.	Denard Span tied it in the third with a leadoff homer, but Bautista's fifth homer of the year put Toronto back on top in the fourth.	Minnesota tied it again in the fifth when Nick Punto doubled and scored on Orlando Cabrera's RBI single but Toronto moved in front for good in the bottom half. John McDonald led off with a double, took third on a grounder and scored on Lind's sacrifice fly.	Game notes	 Toronto RHP Roy Halladay will get an extra day of rest before his next start, Tuesday at New York. LHP David Purcey will make his first start since April on Monday at Detroit. ... Inglett returned to the lineup after missing two games with a sore ankle. ... OF Vernon Wells and SS Marco Scutaro were held out of Toronto's starting lineup but Wells came on as a defensive replacement in the ninth. ... The Twins are 19-30 in day games. ... Ten of the 13 hits were for extra bases, including eight doubles.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- When the first-place Detroit Tigers rolled into last-place Kansas City this week, they had good reason to hope for a three-game sweep.	Instead, the Tigers got swept themselves -- by three spot starters.	Alex Gordon and Alberto Callaspo homered in a 7-4 victory Thursday and the Royals surprised Detroit with their first three-game sweep of an American League team at home all season. They're on their first four-game winning streak since June 12-16.	"It feels absolutely tremendous, especially considering the three starters that we did it against," Kansas City manager Trey Hillman said. "I'm really proud of what we were able to do this series."	With Minnesota also losing on Thursday, the Tigers retained their 5 1/2-game lead in the AL Central as they headed back to Detroit for a seven-game homestand. But the momentum they brought to Kansas City on the heels of a six-game winning streak had definitely disappeared.	"Anybody who starts believing on how good they are is crazy, 'cause the baseball gods will bite you," Tigers manager Jim Leyland said.	Zach Miner (6-5) gave up three runs and five hits in relief for the Tigers, who were fresh off a three-game sweep at Tampa Bay.	Not only had the Royals dropped four in a row when the Tigers arrived, they were missing injured pitchers Gil Meche and Brian Bannister and had lost 24 of their last 33 to Detroit at home.	But beginning with Bruce Chen on Tuesday night, the Royals proceeded to win with three straight spot starters, overcoming Detroit's Rick Porcello, Justin Verlander and Jarrod Washburn.	"That's how baseball is," said Washburn, who went five innings and was charged with three runs on seven hits. "Anybody can beat anybody on a given day. Kansas City is playing good baseball right now and took it to us for three days."	Yuniesky Betancourt drove in two runs for Kansas City, which has been struggling to avoid a 100-loss season for the fifth time in eight years.	Roman Colon (2-3) got the win with 1 1/3 innings of scoreless relief while Carlos Rosa, another September call-up, pitched the ninth for his first major league save.	Gordon's leadoff homer in the sixth on Miner's fourth pitch tied it 4-all and Billy Butler's RBI single four batters later put the Royals on top 5-4. Callaspo, who also had a sacrifice fly, hit a solo homer in the eighth.	Callaspo's home run was upheld by video review. Umpires looked at the replay to see if a fan reached over the fence to catch the ball.	Kansas City pecked away for single runs in the first, second and fourth, taking a 3-0 lead over Washburn before the Tigers scored two in the fifth on Gerald Laird's sacrifice fly and Placido Polanco's RBI single.	Detroit jumped on relievers Yasuhiko Yabuta and Colon to take a 4-3 lead in the sixth with an RBI single by Wilkin Ramirez and Adam Everett's RBI double.	Lenny DiNardo, a September call-up from Triple-A Omaha whose last major league win came in April 2008, went five innings for the Royals and gave up seven hits and two runs.	"I had a few butterflies. It's been about a year since I've been able to pitch in the big leagues," he said.	The Royals turned three of their five double plays when DiNardo was pitching.	"I got the ground balls when I needed to and the defense behind me made some really great plays. They were great back there," he said.	Callaspo had a sacrifice fly in the first and Betancourt's RBI single made it 2-0 in the second. In the fourth, Betancourt doubled and scored on Willie Bloomquist's single.	Magglio Ordonez had three hits for the Tigers.	Game notes	 Royals OF David DeJesus stretched his hitting streak to 11 games. ... The video review was the second in Kansas City this year.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

DENVER -- The Colorado Rockies keep losing players and winning games.	Starting pitcher Jose Contreras came out in the third inning with a strained quadriceps Thursday, his second start for injured Aaron Cook.	No matter, the bullpen and a makeshift lineup that was missing its top two sluggers led the Rockies to their seventh straight win, 5-1 over the Cincinnati Reds on Thursday.	"Got to keep the train going," Eric Young Jr. said.	It's chugging along at full steam these days.	The NL wild-card leaders increased their cushion to 4½ games over the idle San Francisco Giants and crept within two games of the first-place Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West. The Dodgers also had the day off.	By sweeping four games from the Reds, the Rockies wrapped up a 9-1 homestand -- one of their best in franchise history. Next, Colorado embarks on a nine-game road trip that includes three in San Francisco.	"We are playing great baseball," Jason Giambi said. "I'm excited that we are doing the little things, moving runners, getting big hits when we need it and getting great pitching. That's what you want to do down the stretch."	All this despite losing pivotal players.	With Troy Tulowitzki and Ian Stewart sitting out a third straight game with back stiffness, the team again had to rely on a patchwork lineup.	With their top two sluggers out, the Rockies went with Clint Barmes at shortstop, Garrett Atkins at third and Young at second. The team even gave first baseman Todd Helton the day off, starting Giambi instead.	Still, the lineup produced.	"It speaks volumes as to the depth and strength of this organization," said manager Jim Tracy, whose team is 63-32 since he took over.	Young was just trying to jump-start a listless offense when he put down a two-out bunt in the third inning.	His bunt, though, slipped through the fingers of pitcher Kip Wells as he tried to field it, and the speedy Young easily beat it out.	That got the Rockies going.	Seth Smith had an RBI single, Giambi laced a two-run double to deep center and Atkins added a two-run homer.	Just like that, the Rockies had a 5-1 lead. It was more than enough.	"You never know how a small thing like my bunt can get something like that going," said Young, who added two stolen bases. "I just wanted to try to get everybody excited and pumped up and ready for their at-bats."	He succeeded.	"The kid lays down a bunt for a base hit?" Tracy said. "Speed kills. ... Things happened from there."	The Rockies lost Contreras in the third when he strained his right quadriceps trying to beat out a grounder. He was taken out of the game and is day to day.	In his absence, Colorado strung together three relievers who allowed just three hits the rest of the way. Juan Rincon (3-2) pitched three effective frames, striking out five to earn the win.	"What a job by our bullpen," Tracy said.	Giambi has been dialed in since joining the Rockies on Sept. 1. The slugger that Tracy has taken to calling "Giambino" now has six RBIs in six games with Colorado.	"I have a lot of confidence right now and I'm swinging the bat well," said Giambi, who nearly hit a solo homer in the eighth, only to have Drew Stubbs reach over the wall to bring it back. "I've come in, fit right in right away and have gotten results."	Wells (1-4) didn't fare well against his former team, giving up five runs and six hits in five innings.	"I made mistakes with sliders that cost me," said Wells, who pitched for Colorado last season. "The slider cost me -- soft pitches over the plate. Atkins really jumped on a bad pitch."	Joey Votto celebrated his 26th birthday with a 2-for-4 afternoon at the plate, while Brandon Phillips had three singles and a stolen base for Cincinnati. Phillips' run-scoring single in the first was his 86th RBI.	The Reds had a chance to pounce on the Rockies in the first inning, but Contreras struck out Wladimir Balentien and Adam Rosales to wiggle out of a bases-loaded jam.	"That's been a problem for us all year, and it was today," Reds manager Dusty Baker said. "We get runners in scoring position and we can't make contact or put the ball in play."	Game notes	 Rockies right-hander Ubaldo Jimenez had his next start pushed back from Saturday to Tuesday due to a hamstring he tweaked while running the bases Monday. Colorado is expected to call up right-hander Esmil Rogers from the minors to start Saturday at San Diego. Jimenez is slated to go Tuesday in San Francisco. ... The Rockies swept the season series (7-0) from the Reds for the first time in team history.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

WASHINGTON -- Charlie Manuel was angry. It didn't matter that the Philadelphia Phillies nearly pulled off an impressive ninth-inning comeback. No, his club had again lost to a team he felt they should have beaten.	The Phillies lost to the woeful Washington Nationals 8-7 on Thursday night when Ryan Howard hit into a game-ending double play with runners on the corners after Philadelphia scored five runs in the ninth.	Manuel didn't want to take about the comeback. The manager wanted to vent.	"We've been getting outplayed by second-division teams," Manuel said. "We don't put nobody away."	It hasn't been a good time on the road for the defending world champions. In their last three road series, the Phillies lost two of three in Pittsburgh and absorbed a four-game sweep in Houston. After the Astros' sweep, Manuel chewed out his team. After winning the first two against a team that's lost 92 games, Manuel thought his team's play was unacceptable.	"The guys who've been on this team the last couple of years -- they know exactly what they've got to do," Manuel said. "We've got to have a little more get up and go to us."	Philadelphia's lead in the NL East was cut to five games over the Florida Marlins, who routed the New York Mets 13-4. The Phillies had won nine straight against Washington.	"We're the best team in this division," Manuel said. "Nobody's going to give us nothing."	Manuel watched Ian Desmond homer and drive in four runs in his major league debut and Livan Hernandez pitch effectively into the eighth inning.	Adam Dunn hit his 36th homer for the Nationals, who nearly blew the game in the ninth. Matt Stairs snapped an 0-for-30 skid with a pinch-hit grand slam and Shane Victorino doubled in a run in the Phillies' rally.	The last-place Nationals won for only the second time in 12 games overall.	"We're better than they are," Manuel said. "We've got to get after them more -- like we used to."	Victorino denied that his team was complacent, which Manuel implied. He did say the Phillies are making it harder on themselves.	"We're letting these teams have confidence," Victorino said. "We're not putting teams away like we should. We're not dictating what's happening in the game."	Desmond, a 24-year-old shortstop who was recalled from Triple-A Syracuse on Tuesday, doubled in a run in the fourth and his three-run homer keyed a five-run fifth. He narrowly missed a home run in his first at-bat, flying out to deep center field.	Hernandez (8-10), signed by the Nationals on Aug. 25 after he was released by the Mets, improved to 1-5 with a 6.36 ERA in his last eight starts. He allowed two runs and six hits in 7 1/3 innings.	Philadelphia led 2-0 after one but Pete Orr tied with a two-run triple in the third and Desmond put the Nationals ahead with a run-scoring double off Joe Blanton (9-7) in the fourth.	Dunn and Desmond connected in the fifth. Desmond sprinted around the bases so quickly that he nearly caught Elijah Dukes, who had been on first. Desmond had to be coaxed by his teammates into a halfhearted curtain call.	"I've never had anything like that happen before, you know? I didn't know if they were being serious or not, so I didn't want to look like a dummy," Desmond said. "[Coach Tim] Foli told me to step up on the first step. The other guys were saying, 'They want you, they want you.'"	Blanton gave up eight runs and seven hits in 4 2/3 innings, ending his streak of 11 straight quality starts.	Stairs connected in the ninth off rookie Zack Segovia to make it 8-6, ending the longest hitless stretch of his career. It was Stairs' 19th pinch-hit homer and 12th career slam.	Ron Villone yielded an infield single to Chase Utley before earning his first save this season.	Struggling Phillies closer Brad Lidge pitched a scoreless eighth with two strikeouts.	Game notes	 Philadelphia left-hander Scott Eyre had an MRI on his ailing left elbow that revealed a "loose body." The Phillies have shut him down for several days while they consider methods of treatment. ... Philadelphia shortstop Jimmy Rollins made two errors. He had gone 87 games without an error and has made five this season. ... Washington claimed left-hander Jesse English off waivers from the San Francisco Giants.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

NEW YORK -- Nick Johnson has hobbled through some pretty good at-bats since returning from the disabled list, and his teammates have noticed his effort.	Johnson had a pair of two-run singles Thursday night and the Florida Marlins beat the listless New York Mets 13-4 to gain ground on the NL East-leading Phillies.	"That just tells you what kind of gamer he is," Dan Uggla said. "He's just a clutch hitter."	Since returning from a right hamstring strain on Sept. 3, Johnson has at least one hit in each of his six games and has driven in nine runs despite noticeably struggling on the bases.	"It's been a while for me but this is what it's all about," Johnson said about being in a playoff race. "I'm not pushing it. Even though I'm feeling better out there I'm just trying to keep the speed and go from first to third at that speed, do the treatment and try to stay out there."	Hanley Ramirez and Cody Ross each had three hits and two RBIs for the Marlins, who completed their first sweep of the Mets since taking four straight Aug. 30-Sept. 2, 2004, in New York. Uggla hit his 27th homer in the third inning.	Florida has enjoyed its September trips to New York the last couple years. Spoilers in 2007 and '08, the Marlins twice dashed the Mets' playoff hopes on the last day with victories. This year they came to the Big Apple with postseason aspirations of their own.	The Marlins wrapped up a 5-1 trip and moved within five games of Philadelphia, which lost 8-7 at Washington. They also remained 5 1/2 back of the wild card-leading Rockies with 22 games remaining, including six against the Phillies.	"It's a fun part of the year if you're doing it," Marlins manager Fredi Gonzalez said of scoreboard watching.	Johnson delivered in the seventh and eighth as the Marlins missed their season high for runs by one and amassed 16 hits.	The Mets (62-78) fell 16 games under .500 for the first time since finishing 71-91 in 2004.	Playing in front of a Citi Field crowd that was about half the announced attendance of 37,620, the Mets showed why they've come apart this season.	Bobby Parnell walked consecutive batters with the bases loaded after an error by shortstop Anderson Hernandez and Angel Pagan forgot how many outs there were while running the bases. Luis Castillo had another adventure at second base and New York pitchers didn't have a 1-2-3 inning until the ninth.	The Mets held a 30-minute meeting following batting practice then fell behind quickly. The Marlins led 3-0 by the time the 19-minute, 40-pitch first inning was over.	"Every time I have a meeting we seem to play that way so I guess we won't have anymore meetings," manager Jerry Manuel said.	Chris Coghlan hustled for a leadoff double when left fielder Nick Evans and center fielder Pagan were slow to get to his soft liner in the gap. Parnell (3-8) walked Johnson and Ramirez reached on Hernandez's error to load the bases. Parnell then walked two batters for a 2-0 lead.	The Mets lead the majors with 19 bases-loaded walks -- three by Parnell -- two more than Texas. They've also hit two batters with the bases loaded, according to STATS LLC.	"I haven't been as consistent as I wanted to be," said Parnell, who walked five. "To come out in the first inning and not throw strikes is aggravating."	Ross added an RBI single for a 3-0 lead on a fly to shallow center that appeared to be catchable. He also had an RBI double in the fifth.	Rookie left-hander Sean West, who hit a ground-rule double into the New York bullpen in right-center and scored on Ramirez's single in the fourth, scuffled in the bottom half, giving up two runs. He was pulled two batters into the fifth, allowing four runs and six hits. Burke Badenhop (7-4) pitched two innings.	"One of these days, I'll stick around for seven [innings]," West said. "It's all about the Ws. I'm not worried about my performance."	Pagan turned a routine flyout into an inning-ending double play in the seventh. Castillo spun around aimlessly looking for a ball at his feet after diving for Uggla's grounder in the eighth, aiding a three-run inning.	Game notes	 Each team struck out 10 times. ... Mets RHP John Maine (sore shoulder) will make his first start since June 6 on Sunday in a doubleheader opener at Philadelphia. ... Marlins RHP Rick VandenHurk had his normal bullpen session after leaving Tuesday's start with a sore back muscle. He hopes to make his start Sunday against Washington.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

HOUSTON -- Roy Oswalt just can't figure out the Atlanta Braves.	Garret Anderson drove in three runs, Nate McLouth homered and Atlanta broke out of its offensive slump with a 9-7 win over Oswalt and the Houston Astros on Thursday night.	Brian McCann had four hits and two RBIs for the Braves, who finished with 16 hits, two shy of their season high. Atlanta's run total was its highest since a 9-1 win over Philadelphia on Aug. 29.	"We did a lot of hitting," manager Bobby Cox said. "Everyone seemed to chip in with it."	Oswalt (8-6) gave up six runs and 10 hits -- matching a season worst -- in two innings, dropping to 0-3 with a 7.58 ERA in seven career starts against Atlanta.	"He left some pitches up, which he normally doesn't do," McCann said. "We were able to put some good swings on it. It was definitely something we needed to do."	The Braves had scored a total of 10 runs and batted .153 in their previous six games, but led 3-0 after 12 pitches.	Oswalt left his previous start with soreness in his back and departed the clubhouse without speaking to reporters after this one, but manager Cecil Cooper said the right-hander's back wasn't bothering him.	"It looked like the ball was coming out of his hand OK, but he was just having trouble getting his pitches where he needed them," Cooper said. "The back wasn't an issue. I went over to him and asked him about it, but he told me it was fine."	Lance Berkman hit a three-run homer for the Astros, who lost for the third time in Oswalt's last 13 starts.	Houston put two runners on with one out in the ninth against Mike Gonzalez, but Miguel Tejada grounded into his third double play of the game. Gonzalez earned his 10th save.	"I wish I could do better than I did, but that is part of the game," said Tejada, who became the first Astros player to ground into three double plays. "I try to do good every day, but today was the kind of day where nothing was working out for me."	McLouth hit the second pitch of the game into the Astros' bullpen, his second homer of the series. Yunel Escobar then doubled to left-center and scored on Chipper Jones' single to right.	McCann ended an 0-for-20 slump with a single and Jones scored on Anderson's sacrifice fly to left.	Atlanta added three more in the second. McCann doubled in McLouth to give the Braves a 4-1 lead. Anderson and Adam LaRoche added RBI singles.	Tejada thought Oswalt's back must have been hurting, despite what he told Cooper.	"I was surprised to see the way he was," Tejada said. "He is one of those pitchers that just does not ever give in. We have to think he did what he did because of his back."	Derek Lowe (14-9) allowed five runs and nine hits in 5 2/3 innings, managing to win for the second time in five starts. The right-hander reached 14 wins for the sixth time in 13 seasons but is disappointed with his year.	"It's been kind of a struggle for me," Lowe said. "If it was a normal year, where you're a lot more consistent, then you can kind of settle down. But this is kind of how I've been pitching for so long. It's been a long season."	Berkman hit his 19th homer off the facade in left center in the third, cutting Atlanta's lead to 6-4. Umpires used instant replay to confirm the ball cleared the yellow line by about a foot.	The first baseman hadn't homered in 32 games, one shy of the longest drought of his career.	Game notes	 Atlanta reached 10 hits for the first time since an 8-7 loss to Florida on Sept. 2. ... McLouth has three leadoff homers this season and six in his career. ... Houston 3B Geoff Blum was out of the lineup after bruising his left shin and spraining his left ankle sliding into second base on Wednesday. "We'll give him a few days," Cooper said. Chris Johnson, whose minor league contract was purchased on Monday, made his first major league start in Blum's place. ... Berkman has 307 career homers, sixth all-time among switch hitters.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- John Lackey is pitching so well even Ichiro Suzuki didn't stand a chance.	Lackey tossed a five-hitter for his first complete game of the season, Torii Hunter hit a tiebreaking two-run homer and the Los Angeles Angels beat the Seattle Mariners 3-0 on Thursday night to finish a three-game sweep.	Lackey (10-7) struck out seven and walked one, finishing in 115 pitches to help the Angels increase their AL West lead to five games over idle Texas. Los Angeles also moved a season-best 29 games over .500.	Suzuki was 0 for 4 and still needs four hits to reach the 200 mark for the ninth consecutive season, which would break the major league mark he shares with Willie Keeler. He was 1 for 14 in the series with three strikeouts.	Suzuki has 26 career hits against Lackey, tied with Kevin Millwood and Barry Zito for his most off a single pitcher. But he struck out against Lackey in his first two times up, both on pitches in the dirt.	"He's a great hitter, so you've got to show him a lot of different things," Lackey said. "You can expand the zone a little bit on him, for sure. He likes to swing and he doesn't take a lot of walks, so there's ways around it."	Suzuki has struck out three times only once in his last 432 games with at least three official at-bats. The only blemish during that stretch was at Anaheim on Sept. 23, 2007 -- when Lackey fanned him twice and Scot Shields got him once.	"You don't see Ichiro striking out twice like that," Seattle manager Don Wakamatsu said. "But you tip your cap to Lackey. He's done it for a number of years now. His velocity was up from last time and he had a great feel for his curveball, as evidenced with Ichiro."	Four of Lackey's eight career shutouts have come against the Mariners, including the last three. His previous one was on Aug. 27, 2007, at Seattle. The complete game was his 14th in 229 career starts and first since Aug. 26, 2008, against Oakland. The right-hander has allowed one earned run in 26 innings over his last three starts.	"The best way to stay on a roll is not to analyze this one too much and get ready for the next one," Lackey said. "It's not going to matter much in Boston when I show up in five days. You've just got to keep going."	Ryan Rowland-Smith (3-2) gave up three runs and 10 hits in seven innings. The 26-year-old left-hander came within three outs of becoming the first Mariners pitcher to go at least eight innings in three consecutive starts since Felix Hernandez in August 2005.	In Rowland-Smith's last four starts, opposing starters have allowed one run over 32 innings.	Rowland-Smith worked with runners on base in every inning except the second, inducing double-play grounders by Bobby Abreu his first two times up. But after the second one, Vladimir Guerrero singled and Hunter hit a towering home run into the rock pile in left-center on a 2-1 pitch.	Erick Aybar added a two-out RBI double in the seventh.	"This game and this series meant just as much to us as it did to them," Wakamatsu said after the Mariners went 0 for 18 in the three games with runners in scoring position. "We came into this series trying to gain some ground. The first game kind of set the tone for everything -- losing in extra innings."	Game notes	 No pitcher has struck out Suzuki three times in the same game since Boston's Josh Beckett did it on April 10, 2007, at Fenway Park. ... The Mariners have an AL-best 4.00 ERA, and are trying to finish first in that category for the first time since 2001, when they won their last division title with a 116-46 record under Lou Piniella and finished with a 3.54 ERA. ... The Angels have swept nine series of three or more games -- two more than last year, when they swept Seattle in a three-game set and a four-game set. The Mariners have been swept four times this season in series of three or more games. ... Angels starting pitchers have allowed fewer than three earned runs in 13 of the team's last 15 games.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CHICAGO -- Ten months ago, Geovany Soto was the near-unanimous choice as NL Rookie of the Year. These days, the Chicago Cubs catcher is just trying to find his swing so his manager will put him on the lineup card more often.	"This game will humble you in a minute," Soto said Friday after driving in two runs with his first homer since Aug. 10 and a sacrifice fly in a 6-4 victory over the Cincinnati Reds.	"Everything's a challenge. You've got to keep grinding. You can't give up. Sometimes, I wanted to put my head down ... but I never did."	After batting .285 with 23 home runs and 86 RBIs last season, Soto is at .220 with 10 homers and 37 RBIs this year. The falloff came after a difficult offseason, as the Cubs didn't re-sign his mentor, Henry Blanco, and Soto tested positive for marijuana at the World Baseball Classic.	He went on the disabled list retroactive to July 7 with a strained oblique muscle. After coming off the DL exactly one month later, he batted .140 with one homer and four RBIs in his next 16 games. Manager Lou Piniella also started platooning Soto with light-hitting Koyie Hill; the Cubs are 38-23 in games caught by Hill vs. 34-44 in Soto's starts.	"Sometimes, it feels like you're swimming against the current and you're not getting anywhere," said Soto, who has two RBIs in each of his last three games. "I've learned you've got to keep fighting. I've still got a lot of work to do, but I feel better at the plate."	Aramis Ramirez rebounded from a poor trip to go 3 for 3 with three RBIs for the Cubs. Chicago, coming off a three-game sweep at Pittsburgh, had not won four in a row since taking five straight from Philadelphia, Cincinnati and Houston from July 22-27.	Cincinnati has lost five consecutive games. The Reds (63-78) have had four skids of five games or longer since the All-Star break.	"Whenever you lose it's usually the case that you're not getting that hit," Reds manager Dusty Baker said. "They got a couple of big ones, especially by Aramis Ramirez, who wasn't swinging well before we got here. We had trouble getting that hit."	Ramirez had as many hits Friday as he did in 22 at-bats during a six-game trip that ended Wednesday. He is batting .398 with 31 RBIs in 31 home games, but .241 with 23 RBIs in 35 road games.	Jeff Stevens (1-0) allowed Jonny Gomes' tying three-run homer in the fifth, winning in relief of Rich Harden, who allowed one run, two hits and five walks in four innings, throwing 103 pitches.	"The first inning, he threw 40 pitches and I knew it was going to be a relatively short outing after that," Piniella said. "He hit his pitch count in the fourth and we got him out of there."	Aaron Heilman, Esmailin Caridad and Carlos Marmol combined four innings of one-hit relief to finish the six-hitter, with Marmol getting three outs for his 12th save in 16 chances.	Chicago, which began the day 11 1/2 games back of NL Central-leading St. Louis, is 18-6 against division rivals Cincinnati and Pittsburgh and 54-61 against the other teams on its schedule.	Justin Lehr (4-2), who pitched a four-hit shutout against the Cubs last month, allowed five runs and five hits in 4 2/3 innings.	"I have good enough stuff to definitely pitch better," Lehr said. "I left some stuff up in the zone, gave up three runs on two-out hits (by Ramirez) ... and two of my walks scored. It doesn't put you in a situation to win."	Ramirez's two-run single gave Chicago a 3-1 lead in the third, and Soto homered in the fourth. Ramirez's RBI single in the fifth put the Cubs ahead for good, and pinch-hitter Bobby Scales doubled in a run in the eighth against Nick Masset.	Game notes	 Cubs LF Alfonso Soriano is to get a second opinion on the left knee injury that has sidelined him since Sept. 4, and Piniella said it was "doubtful" Soriano will play again this season. Piniella also said Soriano's days of batting leadoff were "over with." Soriano, whose 54 career leadoff homers rank second in major league history to Rickey Henderson's 81, had been hitting sixth since July 4. ... Reds RHP Micah Owings rejoined the team Friday, five days after he was hit in the helmet by a pitch from Atlanta's Kenshin Kawakami. Tests were normal and Owings said he felt fine, but Baker said Owings likely won't play in the series.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

CLEVELAND -- Despite another masterful performance, Zack Greinke ended up with a no-decision.	Thanks to Miguel Olivo and David DeJesus, the Kansas City Royals ended up with their fifth straight win.	Olivo homered with one out in the 12th inning after DeJesus saved the game for Kansas City with two accurate throws to the plate from left field, and the Royals beat the Cleveland Indians 2-1 on Friday night.	"It's a great win for us," Royals manager Trey Hillman said. "The only thing that would have been better if Zack had gotten [the win.]"	Olivo, who drove in the Royals' first run with a fourth-inning groundout, hit an 0-2 pitch from Jose Veras into the bleachers in left field for his 19th home run of the season.	The Royals wouldn't have been in a position to win in the 12th if DeJesus hadn't thrown out the potential winning runs in the ninth and the 11th.	Both runners were trying to score from second base on singles by Jhonny Peralta. DeJesus nailed Asdrubal Cabrera on Peralta's one-out single in the ninth. He did it again in the 11th, throwing out Michael Brantley on Peralta's two-out single. Olivo received both throws in plenty of time and blocked the plate.	"It's cool," DeJesus said. "It's one of those things where you do it, move on and have fun watching the other team complain about it."	DeJesus is second in the AL with 13 outfield assists.	"The coaches were telling us to play in," he said. "The first one was easier. I got the ball and threw. The second one was harder. I kind of bobbled it and it got stuck in my fingers, but I ended up getting it there."	Cabrera and Brantley were both waved home by third-base coach Joel Skinner.	"It's the right thing to do," Indians manager Eric Wedge said. "You've got two chances to win the game. Anytime you have a chance to win the game, you take that chance. The guy out there has to field it, transfer it and throw it and the other guy has to catch it. And it's going to have to be a good throw. Tip your cap to DeJesus for two fantastic plays."	It was yet another way to lose for the Indians, who have dropped nine of 11.	"It's another first for me," Wedge said. "I don't think I've ever seen the same guy get two potential game-winning hits and have the same guy throw the guy out both times."	Jamey Wright (2-5) pitched two innings for the win. Joakim Soria pitched the 12th for his 25th save in 28 opportunities.	Veras (4-3) got the loss.	Greinke held the Indians to one run in seven innings, but ended up with his eighth no-decision of the season, the first Kansas City has won. He has received 29 runs in his combined 15 starts of losses and no-decisions.	Greinke, a candidate to win the AL Cy Young award despite his 13-8 record for a woeful team, was masterful again in holding Cleveland to four hits.	"I try to pitch," he said when asked if he's feeling frustrated about his win total preventing him from winning postseason awards. "Hopefully, it works out. I can't focus on that."	The right-hander hadn't allowed an earned run in 23 consecutive innings until the Indians tied the game in the seventh. Shin-Soo Choo tripled off the left-field wall with one out.	It looked as if Greinke would get out of the inning when Peralta popped out, but Travis Hafner lined a 2-1 pitch to left for a tying single. DeJesus attempted a diving catch, but the ball hit off his glove and rolled away.	Greinke blamed himself for the run that tied the game.	"I got behind on Choo and it hurt me," he said. "I don't know what Hafner was doing. It seems like he's trying to go the other way more than he has in the past."	Greinke, who struck out six and didn't walk a batter, didn't allow a runner to reach second base until the seventh. The run snapped a 15-inning scoreless streak for Cleveland.	Greinke was given an extra day's rest after throwing a career-high 125 pitches against Los Angeles on Saturday. He is 2-0 with a 2.16 ERA in five starts against the Indians this season.	Cleveland starter Justin Masterson allowed one run and four hits in six innings.	Game notes	 RHP Brian Bannister received a second opinion on his ailing shoulder Friday in New York, but manager Trey Hillman did not have any updates. ... LHP Lenny DiNardo's strong outing against Detroit in his first start of the season on Thursday was enough to earn him a rotation spot over fellow lefty Bruce Chen, who is moving to the bullpen. Chen is 1-6 in nine starts with the Royals.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

DETROIT -- Brian Tallet has bounced back and forth between Toronto's rotation and bullpen all season.	So far, a bit of stability seems to be doing him good.	Tallet, who is expected to start for the rest of the season, responded with one of his best outings of the year in a 6-4 victory over Detroit Friday night.	"It helps with my focus, because I know I'll be getting the ball every five days or so," he said. "I'm just trying to soak up as many innings as I can."	Tallet (7-9) is 2-0 as a starter in September. He allowed three runs and eight hits in 6 1/3 innings, and matched a career high with seven strikeouts.	"When I strike guys out, it is usually an accident," he said. "I'm mainly pitching to contact, but tonight I was getting ahead of guys and putting them away. I don't usually do that."	The AL Central-leading Tigers have lost four straight to Kansas City and Toronto after a six-game winning streak.	"Maybe we're looking at the scoreboard, but we should be looking at something else," Tigers manager Jim Leyland said. "I think guys are a little too casual around here. They need to step it up. We need to play better, pitch better, hit better and shut some people down."	One Tiger, though, thought the opposition pitching had more to do with the losses than any loss of focus.	"It's hard not to look at the scoreboard, because they are everywhere," Curtis Granderson said. "You have to look at how we've lost these four games. Kansas City pitched well, and that's why they won, and tonight the Jays pitched well."	The Blue Jays won for the third time in their last 13 road games.	"This is great for our team, because we get a chance to play spoiler," Tallet said. "That's a bonus for us."	Three relievers finished, with Jason Frasor pitching the ninth for his ninth save.	"Jason's been great for us," Toronto manager Cito Gaston said. "I don't know if the success comes first or the confidence, but he's got both of them right now and they build off each other."	Nate Robertson (1-2) took the loss, allowing two runs and six hits in 3 2/3 innings. He walked five.	Toronto loaded the bases with two out in the first, but Rod Barajas flew out to the warning track in left to end the inning, and the Blue Jays stranded two more runners in each of the next two innings.	"We let them get away a couple times at the beginning of the game," Gaston said. "Two of the balls we hit would probably have been out of most parks, especially the one Rod hit, but we got a couple out later."	The Tigers took advantage in the third, taking a 1-0 lead when Gerald Laird doubled and scored on Ryan Raburn's sacrifice fly.	Toronto broke through in the fourth, chasing Robertson with a pair of runs. With two out, Adam Lind's single brought home Randy Ruiz, and Vernon Wells followed with an RBI double.	Wells made it 3-1 with a sixth-inning sacrifice fly off Armando Galarraga, and Tallet got out of a bases-loaded jam in the bottom of the inning. Barajas homered in the seventh, and after a Edwin Encarnacion single, Ruiz's two-run homer off Ryan Perry gave the Blue Jays a 6-1 lead.	Detroit rallied for three runs on five hits and a sacrifice fly in the seventh, but Jeremy Accardo struck out Brandon Inge to end the inning with runners on the corners. The Tigers also stranded two runners in the eighth.	Game notes	 Granderson hit seventh for the Tigers -- the first time in his career that he had batted in that spot, and the lowest he has hit since batting eighth on June 22, 2008. ... Robertson left the game with a strained groin and will undergo further tests on Saturday. ... A small child ran on the field between the seventh and eighth innings and picked up the ball sitting behind the mound before returning to the stands. ... Lind left the game with a shin contusion, and is listed as day-to-day.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.
