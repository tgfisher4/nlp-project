BALTIMORE --  There's no telling how long the Baltimore Orioles will have Manny Machado on their side, so they're going to enjoy it while they can.	Machado hit two home runs, Jonathan Schoop singled in the winning run with two outs in the ninth inning, and Baltimore rallied past the New York Yankees 6-5 Tuesday night.	With his contract due to expire after this season and the Orioles seemingly unwilling to pony up the money to keep him in Baltimore, Machado appears destined to be shipped to another team before the July 31 non-waiver trade deadline.	"It crosses my mind, I'm not going to lie," Machado said. "You just try to enjoy your moment, try to enjoy the season like I have since Day 1. You try to take it all in. Nobody ever wants to think about that day."	Especially Schoop, who considers Machado his closest friend on the team.	"You hear the rumors, but I don't want to think about it," Schoop said. "I just want to go out there and enjoy him while we can."	Machado had a solo shot in the fifth and a two-run homer in the seventh, giving him 23 for the season. He's the AL All-Star starter at shortstop, and playing like it.	"He's a great hitter. That's what great hitters do," New York's Aaron Judge said. "They do damage and score runs. We weren't able to keep him at bay."	Greg Bird homered and drove in four runs for the Yankees, who dropped 3 1/2 games behind first-place Boston in the AL East.	After Machado brought the Orioles back from deficits of 3-2 and 5-3, Schoop won it in the ninth against Dellin Betances (1-3).	A hit batter, a double by Adam Jones and an intentional walk to Machado loaded the bases with one out. After Mark Trumbo struck out, Schoop hit a bouncer that glanced off the glove of Bird at first base and into right field.	Zach Britton (1-0) worked the ninth for Baltimore.	New York is an inexplicable 4-5 against the Orioles and 55-26 against everyone else.	"It doesn't matter how they've been playing, they take good at-bats against us," Yankees reliever Chad Green said. "They pitch pretty well. Just one of those things."	Orioles starter Andrew Cashner gave up five runs and five hits in 6 1/3 innings. He has gone eight straight starts without a victory.	After retiring the first 13 Yankees in order, Cashner gave up a single, issued a walk and yielded a home run to Bird.	Machado homered on the first pitch in the bottom half to tie it at 3.	The pattern continued in the seventh. After Bird hit a sacrifice fly and Neil Walker singled in a run, Machado made it 5-all with an opposite-field drive to right off Green.	Machado has five multihomer games this season and 19 for his career.	Coming off the disabled list after being sidelined for a month with two sore hamstrings, Yankees starter Masahiro Tanaka allowed three runs in 4 1/3 innings. He was pulled, as planned, after throwing 80 pitches.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: 2B Gleyber Torres (hip) will begin to ramp up baseball activities this week, manager Aaron Boone said. The hope is that Torres returns soon after the All-Star break. ... C Gary Sanchez (groin) participated in batting practice. Boone says the club will map out a rehab stint of at least one game with a timeline for a return similar to that of Torres.	Orioles: OF Jace Peterson sat out the game after bruising his knee in a collision with the wall on Monday night. ... RHP Chris Tillman (back) allowed four earned runs over 6 1/3 innings for Class A Frederick. He will likely get one more rehab start before the Orioles decide if they want him back in the majors, where he's 1-5 with a 10.46 ERA this season.	FRESH ARMS	The Orioles recalled LHP Donnie Hart from Triple-A Norfolk and selected the contract of RHP Jhan Marinez from Norfolk. Baltimore optioned RHPs Ryan Meisinger and Yefry Ramirez to Norfolk after both pitched multiple innings Monday.	UP NEXT	Yankees: Struggling Sonny Gray (5-7, 5.85 ERA) will start the series finale on Wednesday night. Gray failed to get past the third inning in his last two starts, leaving open the possibility of a demotion to the bullpen. "I had to bad starts in a row. It's no secret," he said. "But at the end of the day I get a chance to compete, a chance to go out there and try to win a baseball game."	Orioles: With a victory Wednesday, Dylan Bundy (6-8, 4.08) will own more than a quarter of Baltimore's wins.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

PITTSBURGH --  In his first two starts after coming off the disabled list in late June, Washington Nationals starter Jeremy Hellickson allowed 12 runs over 8 2/3 innings.	He reversed that trend in a big way Tuesday night, tossing five innings of two-hit ball in a 5-1 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates.	Hellickson (3-1) struck out three and induced seven ground balls as he was both effective and efficient, finishing his outing at 67 pitches.	"I would've liked to go a little deeper, but we just needed a win," Hellickson said. "So, it's just good to feel good again. These last five days have been pretty rough."	After losing eight of nine, Washington has won four of its last six.	The Nationals could afford to pull Hellickson early thanks to the big lead provided by Anthony Rendon, Daniel Murphy and company.?	In the fifth inning, Rendon hit at two-run homer, his 13th of the season. Murphy contributed a hit to a three-run sixth as part of a 4-for-4 night that included two doubles.	It was a big night for Murphy, who hasn't been able to get his bat going since returning in June from offseason knee surgery. The four-hit outing raised his batting average to a season-high .250.	"It's no secret that I haven't really been super productive so far in my at-bats, but I'm feeling better and hopefully I can grind them out myself and do something to help the ballclub win each night," Murphy said.	Pirates reliever Steven Brault walked in a pair of runs in the sixth and Adam Eaton added on with an RBI single.	Rendon's homer was the only damage against Pirates starter Joe Musgrove (3-4), who struck out a career-high nine over five innings. It was Musgrove's first outing back from a trip to the disabled list for a finger infection. An elevated pitch count, including 27 in the first inning, led to his early exit.	"With the pitch count up, I was getting tired after two innings and working a lot harder than I would have liked to," Musgrove said.	The Pirates loaded the bases in the ninth, but newly installed closer Kelvin Herrera struck out Francisco Cervelli to end it. Herrera will handle the ninth inning in place of Sean Doolittle, who was placed on the disabled list with left toe inflammation.	The start of the game was delayed 50 minutes due to rain in the area, but it never rained at PNC Park.	TOUGH NIGHT	Bryce Harper went 0 for 5 with four strikeouts and his batting average fell to .215. Harper and Musgrove grew up playing against one another and Musgrove called it a "friendly matchup."	"I'm just going to look at it as a bad game," Washington manager Dave Martinez said of Harper. "He's a professional and he'll be right back out there tomorrow."	ROSTER MOVES	The Pirates optioned right-handed pitcher Alex McRae to Triple-A Indianapolis to make room for Musgrove. McRae did not appear in a game with Pittsburgh.	Washington replaced Doolittle with reliever Wander Suero, who was recalled from Triple-A Syracuse along with starter Austin Voth. Voth will pitch Saturday. Jefry Rodriguez was optioned to the minors.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: RHP Stephen Strasburg (right shoulder inflammation) made his first rehab start with Class A Potomac. He pitched 3 1/3 innings and allowed two hits, one run and one walk while striking out five.	Pirates: C Francisco Cervelli (concussion) was given the day off. He made back-to-back starts after coming off the disabled list Sunday.	UP NEXT	Nationals: LHP Gio Gonzalez (6-5, 3.76 ERA) is scheduled to start Wednesday's series finale. He is 0-3 over his last six starts but is 4-1 in his career against Pittsburgh.	Pirates: RHP Trevor Williams (6-7, 4.60 ERA) is coming off his shortest outing of the season, when he allowed five runs over 2 1/3 innings against Philadelphia on July 6.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

BOSTON --  Andrew Benintendi bolstered his All-Star credentials, then happily left it up to the fans to decide.	Benintendi hit two doubles and drove in two runs in his final game before fan votes are tallied, and the Boston Red Sox beat the Texas Rangers 8-4 on Tuesday night to extend their winning streak to eight games.	"More importantly, we won the game," Benintendi said. "We had a lot of big hits from a lot of guys tonight."	Eight players had hits for Boston and Benintendi was one of four with two -- his fifth straight game with multiple hits. He also walked and stole a base while helping the Red Sox improve on the best record in the majors with their eighth straight win.	Jackie Bradley Jr. hit a pair of RBI doubles and Xander Bogaerts hit a two-run triple as Boston scored five runs in the third and won for the 15th time in 18 games.	"We're having fun. It's pretty good a lineup right now from top to bottom," Boston manager Alex Cora said.	Matt Barnes (3-2) got the win with one inning of relief, striking out the side in the seventh after the Rangers had pulled within 6-4 with two runs in the sixth. He was the fourth of five relievers the Red Sox rode to another victory after getting three solid innings from Hector Velazquez, who was making his first start since April and wasn't expected to go much longer Tuesday after spending the previous two months in the bullpen.	Rougned Odor homered and Joey Gallo hit a two-run double for the Rangers, who have lost four of five.	Texas also ran into some tough defense, including a diving grab by Bradley on a sinking line drive and a catch by Mookie Betts at the right-field wall to rob Nomar Mazara of a home run.	"That's this ballpark. You know that coming in," Texas manager Jeff Banister said. "You've got a very athletic guy in right field -- this is his home ballpark -- and he knows how to play it."	Yovani Gallardo (3-1) made it through the first two innings without allowing a baserunner, but ran into trouble in the third.	After entering the inning with a 1-0 lead, Gallardo faced the entire Boston lineup in the third as the Red Sox tagged him for six hits -- three of them doubles -- and five runs.	Blake Swihart and Bradley started the rally on back-to-back doubles with one out. Gallardo struck out Mookie Betts for the second out, but Benintendi doubled in a run, Martinez singled and Xander Bogaerts hit a triple over the head of Delino DeShields in the center-field triangle to drive in two more and put the Red Sox up 5-1.	Velazquez allowed one run on two hits over the first three innings. Jalen Beeks, recalled from Triple-A Pawtucket earlier Tuesday, pitched the next 2 1/3, allowing three runs on four hits, before he was pulled for Brandon Workman with one out in the sixth and runners at second and third.	Odor, whose homer in the second cleared the Texas bullpen and landed deep in the tunnel in right, singled and Isiah Kiner-Falefa doubled before Workman came on to face Gallo, whose double to center scored two to pull the Rangers to 6-4.	Barnes took over in the seventh, Joe Kelly pitched the eighth and Ryan Brasier finished it off with a scoreless ninth.	LAST CALL	The (hash)VoteBenny campaign, written in chalk behind home plate as the Red Sox lobbied for a sixth All-Star for next week's game, officially will close on Wednesday afternoon. Benintendi said he's enjoyed the support of his teammates, but will be happy to return from the All-Star break no matter where he spends next week.	"They know I"m not really that kind of guy to hype myself up, but it's been kind of funny to watch and see them get into it," Benintendi said. "Whatever happens. It's out of my hands."	NOW CATCHING	Swihart started at catcher, where the Red Sox are down a man for up to two months as Christian Vazquez recovers from a broken finger. He said facing six different pitchers Tuesday will likely help him adjust defensively and he's happy to have more opportunities to join the potent lineup at the plate.	"It kind of helped me out, just seeing a lot fo those guys and trying to get a rhythm," said Swihart, who went 2-for-4 and scored a run. "My legs will be tired probably tomorrow from running and stuff."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: Vazquez (broken finger) and IF Marco Hernandez (left shoulder) both had surgery Tuesday. Hernandez will miss the rest of the season and Vazquez is out 6 to 8 weeks, the Red Sox said.	UP NEXT	Rangers: RHP Bartolo Colon (5-6, 4.65 ERA) gets another chance at passing Dennis Martinez as the winningest Latin-American pitcher in major league history. Colon and Martinez are tied with 245 career victories.	Red Sox: LHP Chris Sale (9-4, 2.36) has struck out 11 or more in each of his last four starts.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

CLEVELAND --  Indians manager Terry Francona expected to see Oliver Perez run out of the bullpen. Pitching coach Carl Willis made the call for Dan Otero instead.	The mixup was a miserable one for the AL Central leaders.	Joey Votto hit a go-ahead, three-run double off Otero in the ninth inning as Cincinnati scored seven times with two outs, overcoming a gem by Trevor Bauer to beat Cleveland 7-4 on Tuesday night.	Francona instructed Willis to have "O-P" warm up, referring to Oliver Perez, with the bases loaded and a 4-3 lead with closer Cody Allen struggling. Willis misunderstood the message, believing he had used Otero's nickname of "O-T."	"When I saw O-T coming through the gate, it's not that I don't think he can pitch, but it just wasn't the guy I was expecting," Francona said. "We had a communication (error). That one lands squarely on me, no getting around it. I know Carl is beating himself up right now, but that one lands on me."	Willis, who rejoined the staff this season, accepted responsibility for the mistake. He noted that Votto was 0 of 4 in his career against Otero, but said he should have asked Francona for clarification.	Allen (2-4) initiated the sequence by loading the bases after recording two outs in relief of Bauer, who struck out 12 in eight shutout innings. Cleveland's bullpen entered the day with the third-highest ERA in baseball at 5.13.	"Quite frankly, heart of hearts, I felt like Cody was going to get out of the situation," Willis said. "But you know, I made the mistake, got the wrong guy up. It's not that O-T can't get the job done, but it probably wasn't the best matchup."	Adam Duvall also doubled in a pair in the ninth, while Jose Peraza and Eugenio Suarez had RBI singles off Allen. Cincinnati's final seven batters reached base before Scooter Gennett ran into the third out on Suarez's hit.	"I take sole responsibility for everything that took place there," said Allen, who was charged with a career-high six runs. "We're confident in every guy that runs out of that gate and we shouldn't have been in that position in the first place."	Making his first start since being named to his first All-Star Game, Bauer only allowed three singles and didn't surrender a hit until Jesse Winker's one-out liner up the middle in the fifth.	The right-hander became the second major leaguer to post seven consecutive quality starts with eight-or-more strikeouts and no homers allowed, according to the Indians. Pedro Martinez holds the record with eight in 2002.	"Bauer was a handful for us and we ended up scoring all of our runs when he exited the game," Votto said. "There is a reason why he's an All-Star and there is a reason why he is fastly becoming one of the better pitchers, if not one of the best pitchers in the game."	Former Cleveland reliever Kyle Crockett (1-0) netted the final two outs in the eighth after righty Sal Romano went the first 7 1/3 innings. Raisel Iglesias worked the ninth for his second save in two nights and his 19th of the season.	Francisco Lindor hit his fifth leadoff homer of the year and fellow All-Star Jose Ramirez had a solo shot for the Indians. Ramirez' home run was his 25th, marking the eighth time in franchise history the milestone has been reached in the first half of the season.	VERY MEMORABLE	Reds interim manager Jim Riggleman earned his 700th career win, but was unaware of it until after the game. Cincinnati is 38-36 since he took over for Bryan Price on April 19.	"This is really an energetic, high-energy group, a fun-to-manage group," he said. "It was on display at its best right there. That's probably the best inning I've been involved in for a long time."	The four-run comeback in the ninth was the Reds' first since June 30, 2006 against the Indians.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: RHP Homer Bailey (right knee) reported no physical issues after throwing two innings out of the bullpen Sunday in a rehab assignment with Triple-A Louisville.	Indians: OF Lonnie Chisenhall (left calf) will miss 8-10 weeks after a second medical opinion confirmed a Grade 3 strain. He was placed on the disabled list on July 3.	UP NEXT	Reds RHP Tyler Mahle (7-6, 3.66 ERA) takes on Indians RHP Carlos Carrasco (9-5, 4.28 ERA) in the three-game series finale. Mahle hasn't lost since May 20, going 4-0 in eight starts, and has an NL-low 2.04 ERA since June 1.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.

NEW YORK --  Phillies prospect Enyel De Los Santos was slated to be the International League's starting pitcher in the Triple-A All-Star Game on Wednesday. Instead, he joined the big club and made the most of an unexpected opportunity.	De Los Santos won his major league debut and Philadelphia got home runs from Maikel Franco and Odubel Herrera in a 7-3 victory over the New York Mets on Tuesday night.	Franco drove in four runs as the Phillies won for the 10th time in 13 games and took over sole possession of first place in the NL East. Nick Williams had three hits and two RBI, and Rhys Hoskins also got three hits.	De Los Santos allowed three runs and five hits over 6 1/3 effective innings. The 22-year-old right-hander was called up from Triple-A Lehigh Valley, where he was 9-3 with a 1.89 ERA in 16 starts, and matched against another starter making his big league debut in Drew Gagnon of the Mets.	"I was going to start that Triple-A game but this is much better," De Los Santos said through a translator. "This is a dream come true."	Staked to an early lead and armed with an unorthodox and deceptive slingshot delivery that Philadelphia manager Gabe Kapler dubbed a "crossfire," De Los Santos (1-0) cruised for most of the night against a scuffling Mets lineup that's managed only eight runs over the last five games.	"It's kind of a short-arm stroke," Kapler said. "Hides the ball with his body well and leads to uncomfortable swings."	De Los Santos walked three and struck out six. He threw 94 pitches, 58 for strikes.	His girlfriend and a few winter ball teammates were in the crowd to cheer him on.	"A very, very poised, confident individual on the mound and in the dugout," Kapler added. "The job he did was tremendous."	Acquired from San Diego in December for shortstop Freddy Galvis, De Los Santos was also chosen to play for the World Team in Sunday's All-Star Futures Game.	It was the first time a Phillies starter made his debut against another starter in his first outing since Sept. 25, 1944, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Back then, Charlie Ripple faced Charlie Gassaway of the Chicago Cubs at Shibe Park.	Amed Rosario had three hits for the Mets, including two triples to left field. New York has dropped 19 of its last 23 home games.	Franco put the Phillies ahead with a three-run homer off Gagnon (0-1) in the second.	"The changeup was up. Anyone could have hit that out," Gagnon said. "But hat's off to him."	Franco is batting .440 with two homers and seven RBI over his last eight games. He added an RBI single in the sixth and made several nifty plays at third base on hard-hit grounders.	"I'm seeing the ball better," Franco said.	Williams lined a two-run single in the third. Herrera clubbed a solo shot into the Phillies' bullpen in the fifth for his career-high 16th home run.	The 28-year-old Gagnon was charged with six runs and seven hits in 4 2/3 innings. He also hit two batters with pitches.	At the plate, Gagnon drove in Rosario with a sacrifice fly -- giving his family in attendance something to cheer about.	"Surreal," Gagnon said. "Finally here."	BEEN A WHILE	The Phillies are alone in first place after July 1 for the first time since 2011.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: Hoskins crashed violently with his face into the padded left-field wall while chasing Rosario's triple in the third. Hoskins, who broke his jaw in late May when he fouled a ball off his mouth, remained in the game after being checked by Kapler and a trainer. "After I hit the wall and I threw the ball in, that was the first thing I thought of," Hoskins said. "I was like, `Oh, my God. Is my jaw OK?' But yeah, I'm fine."	Mets: 2B Asdrubal Cabrera exited in the seventh with a hyperextended left elbow but should be able to play Wednesday night, according to manager Mickey Callaway. ... RHP Noah Syndergaard plans to throw a bullpen Wednesday. If all goes well, he will start Friday night against Washington. Syndergaard has been sidelined since late May with a strained ligament in his right index finger. ... RF Jay Bruce felt discomfort in his hip when he began baseball activity. He has been shut down for a 10-day period that started Sunday, according to Callaway. After that, Bruce's condition will be reassessed.	UP NEXT	Phillies: Recovering from a bruised forearm, RHP Vince Velasquez (5-8, 4.69 ERA) is expected to return from the 10-day disabled list to start Wednesday night's series finale. Velasquez was hit just below the right elbow by a line drive on June 30. He retrieved the ball and threw it left-handed to first base to get the out, falling to the ground in pain immediately afterward.	Mets: All-Star RHP Jacob deGrom (5-4, 1.79 ERA) tied a season high with eight innings of one-run ball against Tampa Bay last Friday. He leads the majors in ERA.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.

MIAMI --  Christian Yelich looked right at home Tuesday night.	The former Marlin had three hits and a season-high four RBI in his second game back at Marlins Park, helping the Milwaukee Brewers beat Miami 8-4 on Tuesday night.	"He knows this ballpark so he knows how to drive the ball and he did it today," Brewers pitcher Jhoulys Chacin said.	Travis Shaw homered, and he and Tyler Saladino had two RBI each to lift Milwaukee to its seventh win in nine games. Miami beat the Brewers 4-3 in 10 innings Monday.	"It was good for us to get back on track and bounce back, get back in the win column," Yelich said. "We were able to flush that tough one yesterday and we went out there and played well tonight."	Chacin (8-3) allowed four runs and seven hits in 5 2/3 innings. He struck out three and walked three.	Corbin Burnes pitched two perfect innings in his major league debut for the save with family members and a former college coach in attendance.	"That was probably everything I dreamed of, plus some," Burnes said. "That was pretty cool.	Miami's Pablo Lopez (1-1) pitched six innings and allowed five runs.	"The first two innings definitely a big lesson for me," Lopez said. "I settled in after that."	Two-run singles by Yelich and Saladino helped Milwaukee lead 5-3 after two innings. Chacin and Lopez both found a groove after that, and Chacin handed off a 5-4 lead to Dan Jennings and the bullpen. Jennings finished up the sixth, Jeremy Jeffress pitched the seventh and Burnes cleaned up after that.	Shaw hit his 16th homer off Javy Guerra in the eighth for a two-run cushion.	"I thought Travis' homer was huge for sure, I think that was probably the big run," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said.	Yelich added a two-run double to left in the ninth to help the Brewers pull away.	"You get it within one and you're always in striking distance," Marlins manager Don Mattingly said. "You have J.B. (Justin Bour) sitting there. You have at-bats coming, but the Shaw homer gives them a little breathing room and obviously Yeli opens it."	Yelich is batting .292 with 11 homers and 40 RBI in his first season since being traded by Miami. He was named to his first All-Star team.	HANGING TOUGH	Lopez allowed five runs, six hits, and three walks in the first two innings, but the 22-year-old did not allow a hit or a walk in his final four innings.	"There's a lot to like about that outing," Mattingly said. "You love to see a guy continue to compete. A pretty good team over there to throw four straight zeroes after he gives up some runs. It looks like he was on the ropes, he ends up going six innings for us and keeping us right there."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: OF Lorenzo Cain (groin) was given the day off, which was planned as he works himself back after missing 12 games. ... LHP Brent Suter (forearm) could return as early as this weekend at Pittsburgh.	Marlins: OF Lewis Brinson (hip) met with a doctor Monday, but his status remains unchanged. "We're still at no activity and just rehab," Mattingly said. "Basically rest and rehab right now. I don't know how long that's going to be, but I'm assuming it's until he's not feeling anything at all before he starts some baseball stuff." ... RHP Sandy Alcantara (axillary infection) began his throwing program on his way back.	UP NEXT	Brewers: RHP Freddy Peralta (4-1, 2.14 ERA) will take the mound in Wednesday's series finale for the seventh start in his rookie season.	Marlins: RHP Dan Straily (3-4, 4.55) is 4-0 with a 2.12 ERA in six appearances, five starts, against the Brewers.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Wilson Ramos is on a roll lately, and so are the Tampa Bay Rays.	Ramos hit a three-run homer, five Tampa Bay pitchers combined on a five-hitter and the Rays beat the Detroit Tigers 5-2 Tuesday night.	The Rays (47-44) moved three games above .500 for the first time since Aug. 6 last year after posting their 13th win in the last 14 home games.	"I'm very excited for me and my team," Ramos said. "I like to have fun."	Tampa Bay lost its bid for a third shutout in four games when the Tigers scored twice in the ninth. After blanking the Mets in New York on Saturday and Sunday, the Rays outslugged the Tigers 10-9 in 10 innings Monday night.	"Our pitching picked us up big-time," manager Kevin Cash said. "We had a hiccup last night and they certainly hit the reset button. Really an outstanding performance top to bottom with our pitching."	Ramos, elected to start at catcher for the American League in next week's All-Star Game, keyed a five-run third inning when he connected off Matthew Boyd (4-8) for his 14th homer. That tied John Flaherty (1999) for the most in a season by a Tampa Bay catcher.	"The news about the All-Star Game, I'm more excited right now," Ramos said. "I'm trying to go out there happy."	In the final year of his contract and expected to be dealt before the July 31 trade deadline, Ramos has five homers and 15 RBI over his last 12 games.	Ryne Stanek pitched two innings as the opener for the Rays on their latest bullpen day. He allowed a first-inning single to Niko Goodrum.	Jose Alvarado (1-3) and Jaime Schultz followed Stanek, and both tossed two hitless innings.	Detroit didn't get its second hit until John Hicks' two-out infield single in the seventh against Adam Kolarek, who allowed Nicholas Castellanos' RBI double and a run-scoring single by Goodrum in ninth.	"We made a little bit of a run there at the end, but one inning cost us the ballgame," Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire said.	Sergio Romo got the final out for his 10th save.	Tigers shortstop Jose Iglesias exited in the eighth with a bruised left hand after being hit by a pitch from Kolarek.	Gardenhire said X-rays were negative and Iglesias will "probably miss a day or so."	Stanek has made 11 starts -- totaling 16 2/3 innings -- since May 26, with 10 of them being scoreless outings.	Boyd gave up five runs and four hits in six innings. The lefty is 0-4 over his last six starts, allowing 28 runs in 28 innings during that stretch.	"I made a bad pitch to Ramos and that's about it," said Boyd, who struck out eight.	The skidding Tigers have lost 17 of 21.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: 3B Jeimer Candelario started after missing Monday's game with the flu. ... RHP Shane Greene (right shoulder strain) is throwing off a bullpen mound.	Rays: RHP Jake Faria (left oblique strain) will make his second rehab start later this week with Triple-A Durham. ... Two-way prospect Brendan McKay could pitch Wednesday in a Gulf Coast League game for the first time since missing four weeks with an oblique injury. On the Class A Charlotte disabled list, McKay returned Monday as the DH.	MOVING DAY	Tampa Bay recalled 1B-OF Ji-Man Choi from Triple-A Durham and optioned OF Johnny Field to the International League club.	UP NEXT	Tigers RHP Jordan Zimmermann (4-0) will start Wednesday's series finale against a second consecutive Rays reliever. Zimmermann, who has experienced back issues, will continue treatment and might get a shot during an extended period off coinciding with next week's All-Star break. He could be slotted toward the back of the rotation coming out of the break.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

ATLANTA --  A rejuvenated Marcus Stroman outlasted Julio Teheran by forcing the Braves to consistently hit grounders.	Toronto's batters did their part in a decisive eighth inning.	Russell Martin's sharp single in Toronto's five-run eighth drove in the go-ahead run, Stroman pitched seven strong innings, and the Blue Jays beat Atlanta 6-2 on Tuesday night to knock the Braves out of first place.	Stroman (2-6) frustrated the Braves by mixing his cutter and slider and recording 14 of his 21 outs on the ground.	"When I'm pairing the cutter and slider it makes it pretty hard on the hitters," Stroman said.	Stroman said he has felt strong since returning from the disabled list on June 23. The Blue Jays have won three of his four starts since he missed six weeks with right shoulder fatigue.	"It was an outstanding effort," Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. "It doesn't surprise me. I think he has rounded back into shape the way we've seen him so many times."	Stroman gave up one run and six hits with two walks in seven innings.	The Braves, who have lost six of their last seven, fell to second in the NL East after beginning the day tied with Philadelphia for the lead. The Phillies beat the Mets 7-3. Atlanta held at least a share of first since May 30.	Toronto was limited to three hits through seven innings by Teheran and Jesse Biddle, and the game was tied 1-1. The Blue Jays broke out with five hits off A.J. Minter (3-2) and Shane Carle in the eighth.	Aledmys Diaz doubled in two runs before scoring on a double by Devon Travis. Kevin Pillar had a run-scoring single in the big inning, which opened with a fielding error by Braves shortstop Dansby Swanson on Yangervis Solarte's grounder.	Teheran stranded two baserunners in each of the first two innings before giving up Justin Smoak's 13th homer with one out in the third.	Toronto protected the 1-0 lead until the sixth. Kurt Suzuki's single off Stroman (2-6) drove in Ozzie Albies, who opened the inning with a bunt single.	Teheran allowed one run and three hits with three walks in 6 2/3 innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays:  Josh Donaldson, on the DL since May 29 with tightness in his left calf, has resumed baseball activities. ... Gibbons said he couldn't confirm reports that top prospect 3B Vladimir Guerrero Jr. could be promoted to Triple-A Buffalo when he returns from a minor left knee injury. ... RHP Aaron Sanchez (right index finger) threw in the outfield with no issues and will next advance to throwing off a mound. ... RHP Ryan Tepera (right elbow inflammation) threw off a mound.	Braves: OF Ronald Acuna was 0 for 4 after being held out of the lineup two straight days with left groin tightness. ... RHP Brandon McCarthy (right knee tendinitis) is "not coming around like we hoped right now," said manager Brian Snitker. McCarthy was placed on the 10-day DL on June 28.	NO RELIEF	Minter gave up four runs, three earned, while recording only one out.	"I just felt I didn't have my A-plus stuff," said Minter after seeing his ERA climb from 2.68 to 3.38. "I think I made a couple bad 0-2 pitches and 1-2 pitches. ... They made me pay for it so you have to tip your cap to them."	FLASHBACK	Stroman earned his second win in Atlanta in two seasons. He threw 5 2/3 scoreless innings and hit his first career homer in a 9-0 win over the Braves on May 18, 2017.	This time, he singled in his first at-bat in the second, clearing enjoying the opportunity to swing the bat. "I'm just trying to be aggressive in the box," he said.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays: RHP Sam Gaviglio is 2-1 with a 4.91 ERA in five career interleague games, including four starts, entering Wednesday night's game against the Braves.	Braves: RHP Mike Foltynewicz will start on regular rest against the Blue Jays. There was consideration of pushing back the start, but additional rest might have left Foltynewicz unable to participate in his first All-Star game on July 17.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

CHICAGO --  Dexter Fowler broke out of his funk in grand style.	The slumping outfielder hit his fourth career grand slam, All-Star Miles Mikolas tossed six innings of three-hit ball and the St. Louis Cardinals routed the Chicago White Sox 14-2 on Tuesday night.	Kolten Wong had four hits, including a two-run homer and a double, as every St. Louis starter except catcher Yadier Molina got at least one hit. Jose Martinez had three hits and two RBI.	"(Fowler) has been working to get that feel, so that's something to build on," manager Mike Matheny said. "Just some big days all around. A big day for Kolten, getting four hits and the ball jumping for him, too."	Fowler lofted his sixth homer this season, but first since May 6, to cap the Cardinals' seven-run sixth. He finished with two hits and played right field in only his second start since June 27.	Fowler entered batting just .167 -- and .111 in his previous 20 games.	"It's awesome, especially when you've been scuffling at the plate trying to get timing and stuff," he said. "You get a pitch and you barrel it up, it feels good."	Wong is batting only .221 this season, but has 10 hits in his last 18 at-bats. He said the surge is a result of working on swing mechanics with hitting coach John Mabry.	"I'm not really worried about my swing," Wong said. "I'm just really focused on seeing the ball, hitting the ball right now."	Mikolas (10-3), selected to his first All-Star team Sunday, faced only three hitters in five of his six innings. The right-hander allowed two runs and struck out six.	Charlie Tilson drove in two runs for the White Sox in the third, one of only two innings in which Chicago had baserunners against Mikolas.	White Sox starter Dylan Covey (3-5) lasted five innings, allowing five runs (four earned) on nine hits and two walks. The right-hander lost his fourth straight decision and has an 11.70 ERA in his last five starts.	Mikolas came out dealing, fanning five of the first six White Sox hitters. Covey started strong, too, retiring eight of the first nine Cardinals batters and striking out four.	Then with two outs in the third, four consecutive line-drive singles gave St. Louis a 2-0 lead.	"I felt good early on," Covey said. "I think the ball started creeping up in the zone as I went. Groundballs turn into base hits. (St. Louis) strung a few together. (I) struggled to get it back down."	The White Sox tied it 2-all in the bottom half. Tilson's single, the third straight hit off Mikolas to start the inning, drove in both runs.	The Cardinals moved back ahead 3-2 in the fourth when Jedd Gyorko scored from third on a forceout. St. Louis made it 4-2 in the fifth on Molina's sacrifice fly.	Then the Cardinals broke it open in the sixth with seven runs on three hits and four walks.	Omar Narvaez's passed ball and a wild pitch by reliever Bruce Rondon allowed two runs to score. Rondon issued three straight walks to force in another run before Fowler went deep to left-center off Hector Santiago.	Wong's two-run shot off Santiago in the eighth made it 13-2. Martinez doubled home a run in the ninth.	GRAND HISTORY	Fowler's slam was his first since last August versus Kansas City. It also was the switch-hitter's first from the right side. Fowler connected for his first grand slam with Colorado in September 2012 off Mikolas, who then pitched for San Diego.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: CF Tommy Pham (bruised left ankle) was scratched from the lineup and replaced by Yairo Munoz. Pham fouled a ball off his foot on Sunday in San Francisco. ... Molina returned after sitting out two games with a sore shoulder. He also was added to the NL All-Star roster as a replacement for Giants catcher Buster Posey, who will miss the game because of a nagging hip injury that requires an injection. ... RHP Luke Gregerson (right shoulder impingement) rejoined the team from a rehab stint at Triple-A Memphis, but had not yet been activated from the disabled list.	White Sox: OF Avisail Garcia was placed on the 10-day disabled list with a Grade 1 right hamstring strain. Garcia, an All-Star in 2017, missed two months earlier this season with a more serious strain to the same muscle, but in a different location. GM Rick Hahn hopes Garcia will return after the All-Star break. The White Sox added outfielder Ryan LaMarre to take Garcia's place.	UP NEXT	Cardinals RHP Luke Weaver (5-7, 4.92 ERA) faces LHP Carlos Rodon (1-3, 4.29) on Wednesday in the finale of the two-game set. Weaver pitched two-hit ball over a career-high eight innings last Thursday in San Francisco and carried a perfect game into the sixth.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

MINNEAPOLIS --  The Kansas City Royals finally bunched together some runs to end a lengthy losing streak.	Adalberto Mondesi had a three-run homer and a career-high four RBI, and Kansas City snapped a 10-game skid with a 9-4 win over Minnesota on Tuesday night.	The Royals scored more than five runs for the first time since June 4 and improved to 26-65 overall, percentage points ahead of Baltimore to avoid owning baseball's worst record.	Mondesi went deep in the second inning and added an RBI single in the sixth. The middle infielder entered with just six RBI in 17 games this year. He also impressed his manager by drawing just his second walk of the year and making several key defensive plays.	"It's fun to watch Mondy," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "He jumped on a high fastball. Another big base hit. The double play that he turned was huge at that point."	Royals right-hander Ian Kennedy made his first start since landing on the disabled list with a strained left oblique. He pitched just three innings after experiencing a recurrence of left side tightness.	Kennedy will have an MRI on Wednesday. He said Tuesday's injury was in a different location than the oblique strain that landed him on the DL.	"All week, the last 10 days, everything has been getting better," Kennedy said. "It felt great all night, and then all of a sudden I felt something at the bottom of my ribs. ... It's just aggravating."	Yost said Kennedy will not make his next scheduled start on Sunday.	Kennedy was looking for his first win since April 7 but failed to qualify. The right-hander gave up two runs and five hits while striking out three. He has gone 16 starts since his last victory.	Brian Flynn (1-1) allowed one hit in four innings of relief to pick up the win. Kansas City needed innings from the bullpen after Kennedy's early exit, and Flynn and Jason Hammel delivered.	"It was a lot of fun tonight," Flynn said. "We've been waiting for this one."	Twins starter Aaron Slegers (1-1) allowed five runs and got just four outs in his second start of the year. His first start yielded a win with six sharp innings against Baltimore five days earlier.	Tuesday's performance was a stark contrast from that game for Slegers.	"They're an aggressive team. I knew that going in," Slegers said. "Some of my pitches caught a little too much of the plate and even others that didn't, they found a way to get the bat on the ball and found holes."	Brian Dozier drove in the game's first run for Minnesota with a solo homer in the first. Eduardo Escobar plated the Twins' second run with a single in the third.	Minnesota scratched across two runs in the ninth with the game already out of hand, ending a five-game winning streak.	"Everybody is trying to stay positive," Twins left fielder Eddie Rosario said. "But nothing's changed from the winning streak. It was a bad game."	BACHELORETTE HELPS OUT TWINS	Becca Kufrin, star of ABC's "The Bachelorette," threw out the first pitch before Tuesday's game. Kufrin, a Minnesota native, was at Target Field to help the Twins promote Eddie Rosario's campaign for the MLB All-Star Game's Final Vote.	Rosario is one of five AL finalists for the Final Vote spot, and the Twins have taken a page from the popular TV show by using the slogan "Accept This Rosie." He caught the first pitch from Kufrin and offered her a rose.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Twins: RHP Ervin Santana (60-day DL, finger surgery) started Tuesday for Double-A Chattanooga as part of his rehab assignment. He allowed two runs on two hits and struck out six in five innings. Santana is expected to be moved up to Triple-A Rochester for his next rehab start Sunday.	UP NEXT	Royals: RHP Burch Smith (0-0, 5.40 ERA) will be making his first start of the season after appearing in 24 games as a reliever. It will be the first major league start for Smith since 2013 with San Diego.	Twins: RHP Lance Lynn (6-7, 5.21) is coming off a start in which he allowed just one run in six innings against Baltimore. Lynn earned the victory in his first meeting against the Royals this year, holding Kansas City to two runs in eight innings back on May 28.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

HOUSTON --  Alex Bregman agreed when someone called the final play on Tuesday night in Houston a circus. Oakland catcher Jonathan Lucroy described it as "a big zoo."	Both descriptions could work for the wild way this one ended.	Bregman homered twice and his tapper just in front of the plate in the 11th inning led to a bizarre sequence that ended the game, as Lucroy's throwing error handed the Astros a 6-5 victory over the Athletics.	"It was a crazy play," said Oakland manager Bob Melvin, who had to watch it from the clubhouse after being ejected for arguing a check swing in the fourth. "Crazy way the game ended."	Justin Verlander pitched six sharp innings and the Astros took a 4-0 lead into the ninth before the Athletics tied it.	Stephen Piscotty hit a solo homer with two outs in the top of the 11th off Collin McHugh (5-0) to put the A's ahead, but the Astros staged their own rally.	All-Star closer Blake Treinen (5-2) walked pinch-hitter Josh Reddick, who went to third on a single to right field by rookie Kyle Tucker. With the infield playing in, Tony Kemp hit a grounder to shortstop Marcus Semien. He made a low throw home that Lucroy was unable to handle, allowing Reddick to slide in safely with the tying run.	With one out, Bregman's dribbler started out foul before spinning into fair territory just a few feet up the first base line. Bregman failed to run initially, so Lucroy scooped up the ball and reached for Bregman as he backpedaled -- the bat still in his hand -- in an effort to dodge the tag.	But the ball slipped out of Lucroy's bare hand, pinballed off plate umpire David Rackley and Lucroy, and then fell to the ground.	"That's when we were playing dodgeball there for a couple of seconds," Lucroy said. "That was just a big mess, a big zoo behind the plate there. Hopefully I never have to see that again. That's the first time that's ever happened in my eight years. Hopefully it's the last time."	Still with plenty of time, though, Lucroy picked up the ball, set his feet with an angle to throw to first base -- and fired the ball off the back of Bregman's helmet as he ran up the line.	The ball ricocheted into foul territory in right field, and Tucker trotted home with the winning run.	Following a replay review, the play stood as called on the field.	Bregman was glad things worked out in Houston's favor, but mad that he swung at what he called a "horrible pitch."	He called his swing "the biggest circus of the whole thing," and added: "I think it was the softest ball anyone's ever hit."	Treinen had converted 20 straight save chances since April 18.	Houston reliever Ken Giles allowed three consecutive singles with nobody out in the ninth as the A's pulled to 4-1. The television broadcast appeared to show Giles cursing at manager AJ Hinch as he was lifted. Hinch was asked about the outburst by Giles, who earlier this season punched himself in the face as he left the mound following another bad outing.	"That stuff happens in the heat of battle," Hinch said. "I'll have to look at it. He can let me know if it was directed at me; I didn't hear anything. And you can certainly understand that I'll address it if it turns out it was at me."	Giles was replaced by Hector Rondon, who was greeted by an RBI single from Matt Olson to make it 4-2.	Rondon struck out Piscotty before a wild pitch left runners at second and third. There were two outs when Semien's second double of the game tied it at 4.	Bregman hit his first homer off Sean Manaea in the first inning. George Springer added RBI singles in the second and fourth to make it 3-0.	Bregman, chosen for his first All-Star Game on Sunday, connected off Emilio Pagan in the seventh for the first multihomer game of his career.	Verlander yielded three hits and struck out six, lowering his ERA to an AL-best 2.05. Manaea allowed seven hits and three runs in four-plus innings.	The Athletics hadn't given up a run in 23 1/3 innings when Bregman homered in the first.	HE'S IN	Oakland second baseman Jed Lowrie was added to the AL All-Star squad to replace injured Yankees rookie Gleyber Torres.	"That was a very rewarding phone call I got to make today, because we all know he should have been on the team," Melvin said. "And he was having a tough time with it, as well."	It's the first career selection for the 11-year veteran.	"Showed some perseverance and worked hard to get to this point so any All-Star Game would have a lot of meaning," Lowrie said. "But I think for the first time as a 34-year-old, it's pretty special."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: RHP Trevor Cahill (strained right Achilles) is expected back from the disabled list to start Thursday in the series finale.	Astros: SS Marwin Gonzalez left before the second inning after being kicked in the left wrist and elbow by Dustin Fowler when he tagged him out as he tried to steal second base in the first. The team said Gonzalez had a bruised wrist and elbow and is day-to-day.	UP NEXT	Lance McCullers (10-3, 3.41 ERA) will pitch for Houston against Chris Bassitt (1-3, 3.00) when the series continues Wednesday. McCullers struck out a career-high 12 in his last start to extend his winning streak to four games. Bassitt is 1-0 with a 1.69 ERA in two starts since being recalled from Triple-A Nashville on June 27.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

DENVER --  Tyler Anderson kept Arizona in check for six innings. Once he left, the Diamondbacks pounced on the Colorado Rockies bullpen.	David Peralta and A.J. Pollock homered in Arizona's four-run seventh inning, and the Diamondbacks beat the Rockies 5-3 on Tuesday night.	"It's good when you do something to help the team to win," said Peralta, who has 16 home runs. "You have to be ready for a mistake. I was trying to slow down the game. I was really happy."	Nick Ahmed also went deep as the Diamondbacks won for ninth straight time at Coors Field.	Arizona managed just three hits off Anderson but a high pitch count ended his night early. The Diamondbacks roughed up the Rockies' bullpen in the seventh.	Jake McGee (1-3) walked Jeff Mathis, allowed a double to pinch-hitter Chris Owings before Peralta hit the first strike he saw into the seats in right to give the Diamondbacks a 4-2 lead.	"I threw two bad pitches with my secondary pitches," McGee said. "The second one I got it up too much to Peralta. You are going to pay when that happens."	Pollock hit a solo homer later in the inning off Scott Oberg.	The big inning wasted another strong outing for Anderson. He has allowed just one run in his last three starts, two of which have come at Coors Field. He has a 0.45 ERA since losing to the Miami Marlins on June 23rd.	He walked four batters Tuesday, two leading off the third inning but came back to strike out the side and leave the runners stranded.	"I was working fast, too fast," Anderson said. "I stayed back and made good pitches. A lot of times when you're back is against the wall, you have to do that."	Nolan Arenado hit his 23rd homer off Archie Bradley in the bottom of the seventh, tying him for the NL lead in that category. The Rockies put the tying run on first but Andrew Chafin retired the last two batters to end the threat.	Randall Delgado (2-0) tossed 1 2/3 innings in relief of Patrick Corbin to get the win. Brad Boxberger pitched the ninth for his 22nd save.	Corbin went only 4 1/3 innings and failed to pitch at least five innings for the first time this season. The left-hander came into the game with a 0.95 ERA in his previous three starts.	"I didn't go as deep into the game as I'd like," Corbin said. "Just a couple of mistakes and got my pitch count early. I was hoping to get through the fifth there but the bullpen came up huge."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: RHP Clay Buchholz (left oblique strain) threw a bullpen on Tuesday while INF Deven Marrero (left oblique strain) continues to do range-of-motion exercises.	Rockies: OF David Dahl (broken right foot) took batting practice Wednesday. Dahl has been out since June 1 after fouling a ball off his foot against San Francisco.	HOME AWAY FROM HOME	Arizona's nine straight wins at Coors Field are a franchise record at an away ballpark. The Diamondbacks haven't lost in Denver since June 20, 2017.	"You come up here and we're ready to play our best baseball," manager Torey Lovullo said. "For the first five innings we looked like we were semi-sleepwalking but the right guys came up when we needed them."	Arizona had an eight-game winning streak at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia snapped in April.	ROSTER MOVE	The Rockies activated C Tom Murphy from the paternity list and optioned INF Jordan Patterson to Triple-A Albuquerque.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks RHP Shelby Miller (0-3, 9.00) makes his fourth start Wednesday since returning from Tommy John surgery. He will face Colorado RHP German Marquez (7-8, 4.92), who is 2-0 with a 1.29 ERA with 14 strikeouts and no walks in his last two starts.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Jose Quintana told Kyle Hendricks he would do all he could to follow him with another strong start by the Cubs rotation.	This is exactly what manager Joe Maddon hoped to see: the pitching getting on a little roll and hitters doing their part as the second half nears.	Victor Caratini hit an RBI double during a decisive seventh inning, helping Chicago back Quintana in a close game and beat the San Francisco Giants 2-0 on Tuesday night.	A night after losing 2-1 in 11 innings despite a strong start from Kyle Hendricks, the Cubs had enough offense for Quintana (8-6) -- and they could have a healthy third baseman Kris Bryant back in the lineup for Wednesday afternoon's series finale.	Quintana allowed three hits in six scoreless innings to beat the Giants for the first time in his career after the lefty went 0-3 with a 5.82 ERA over his first three starts.	"I said to Kyle `I'll try to follow you," Quintana said. "It's really good for us."	Addison Russell's one-out double in the seventh chased Giants starter Derek Holland (5-8). Russell advanced on Sam Dyson's wild pitch and scored on a bad throw by catcher Nick Hundley trying to get Russell at third. Caratini later doubled.	Carl Edwards Jr. struck out the side in order in the seventh, Justin Wilson followed with a perfect eighth and Steve Cishek closed it out for his third save after taking the loss Monday. Maddon said afterward Brandon Morrow wasn't available for the ninth because of a planned second consecutive day off.	The Giants got just one baserunner over the final four innings.	"We've had a lot of good innings out of a lot of different members of our bullpen," Maddon said. "So when it got to that tonight it's not like it was anything new."	Holland struck out eight and didn't walk a batter in 6 1/3 innings. Johnny Cueto had been the announced scheduled starter, but manager Bruce Bochy gave Cueto an extra day to recover, something that could be the norm in the second half for the veteran right-hander.	Holland has been versatile: In less than a week, he pinch-ran, pitched twice in relief then returned to the rotation.	"If I have to go back to the `pen I'll be perfectly fine," he said. "Whatever Bochy and the guys come up with, I'm going to do."	Giants center fielder Gorkys Hernandez returned to the lineup after missing Monday's game nursing a tight calf that forced him to an early exit Sunday against the Cardinals.	Aside from a pinch-hit appearance in the eighth, Buster Posey had the night off for the Giants and was scheduled to catch the day game Wednesday. He has to skip the All-Star Game because of a lingering right hip injury that will require an injection.	FAMILIAR MAN ON THE PA	Former Giants third base coach Tim Flannery will handle public address announcer duties for Wednesday's series finale as Renel Brooks-Moon participates in San Francisco Mayor-Elect London Breed's inauguration.	"A great honor for both of us," Flannery posted on Twitter.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: Bryant was headed to the Bay Area hoping he will be ready to come off the disabled list and play Wednesday afternoon's series finale against the San Francisco Giants. Bryant, out since June 23 with inflammation in his left shoulder, played rehab games for Double-A Tennessee on Monday and Tuesday. He had hoped to re-join the Cubs during their series at AT&T Park.	Giants: 2B Joe Panik will be out at least a few weeks with a strained left groin. Panik hopes to begin light movements this weekend to test the tender leg, noting "nothing was torn off the bone." ... 3B Evan Longoria, three weeks out from surgery on his fractured left hand, is doing more baseball activities such as taking groundballs, working on flips, playing catch and hitting off the tee. "I feel on track to being where I need to be," Longoria said. ... RHP closer Hunter Strickland had pins removed from his surgically repaired broken pitching hand that he injured punching a door in frustration after blowing a save against the Marlins on June 18.	UP NEXT	Cubs: LHP Mike Montgomery (3-3, 3.68 ERA) is 0-1 in four career appearances against the Giants with two starts, posting a 3.78 ERA with one save.	Giants: RHP Cueto (3-1, 1.95) makes his second start since coming off the disabled list from a 61-game absence with an inflamed pitching elbow and seventh overall in 2018. He is 9-9 in 25 career starts vs. the Cubs.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  After a big game with the bats, the Los Angeles Angels went home worried about one of their most important arms.	Kole Calhoun and Andrelton Simmons each had three of Los Angeles' 15 hits Tuesday night, but starting pitcher Garrett Richards left in the third inning of a 9-3 victory over the Seattle Mariners because of irritation in his right forearm.	Richards has been plagued by injuries during his career and this was just his second start since coming off the disabled list after being sidelined by a left hamstring strain. He is scheduled to have an MRI on Wednesday.	"It's tough. Just hoping for good news," Calhoun said. "He's been battling for the better half of a couple years. Hopefully, everything comes back all right."	Calhoun and Albert Pujols both homered for the Angels, who have won three of four. Calhoun and Simmons each had two RBI.	Simmons, seeking his first All-Star appearance as one of five candidates in online balloting for the final AL spot, hit a go-ahead double in a four-run fourth.	Seattle All-Star Mitch Haniger hit a three-run homer in the first for a 3-0 lead against Richards, who allowed three consecutive hits to begin the game. He exited in the third while pitching to Nelson Cruz.	Richards' velocity was down. After a 92 mph pitch, a trainer and Angels manager Mike Scioscia went to the mound, and the right-hander quickly walked off the field.	"Pregame warmups, in talking to (pitching coach Charles Nagy), he was a little erratic," Scioscia said. "Velocity looked good and his slider was good. His command was a little off. I think you can see that after he got through the first inning, the second inning was OK, but the third inning the velocity dropped and the quickness wasn't there."	Richards gave up three runs and four hits in 2 2/3 innings. Noe Ramirez (4-3), Cam Bedrosian, Jose Alvarez, Hansel Robles and Taylor Cole combined to pitch 6 1/3 shutout innings in relief.	"We've had our share of bullpen games that aren't by design," Scioscia said. "We've had a lot of times where these guys have come in the second, third or fourth inning and kept us in the game. All those guys came in and did a great job. I think Taylor Cole at the end gave us two innings to give some other guys a night off and that's helped a lot."	Mariners starter Mike Leake (8-6) allowed seven runs -- five earned -- and 11 hits in four innings. Seattle has lost three of four.	"He's not locating," manager Scott Servais said. "That's his game. You got a feeling they were on his pitches, and he didn't have enough to slow them down. He's faced them back-to-back outings, and they had a good read on what he's trying to do. He's a big part of what we're doing in the first half and we just have to get him back on track."	LONG BALL GOES A LONG WAY	The Angels have hit 16 home runs against Seattle, their most versus any opponent this season.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: RHP Felix Hernandez (sore back) was placed on the 10-day disabled list and is expected back in the rotation after the All-Star break. He had not been doing any side work between starts because of his back issues.	Angels: LHP Tyler Skaggs (right adductor strain) threw a bullpen and the Angels hope he can start Thursday. ... RHP Nick Tropeano (right shoulder inflammation) is scheduled to make another rehab start Friday at Class A Inland Empire.	UP NEXT	Mariners: LHP Marco Gonzales (9-5, 3.64 ERA) has gone at least six innings in 12 of his last 14 starts. He's 1-0 with a 3.91 ERA in five career starts against the Angels.	Angels: RHP Jaime Barria (5-5, 3.39) is seeking his first win since June 1. He allowed two runs and five hits over 5 1/3 innings in Seattle during his last start, a loss.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

NEW YORK --  San Diego Padres rookie left-hander Eric Lauer popped out of the dugout for the ninth inning and was greeted by Cake's "The Distance" on the PA, as well as the heart of the Los Angeles Dodgers' order.	"When you're out there you notice everything, especially the song," Lauer said. "It made me think about it. I was kind of like, `Don't put that in my head too much. I still have to get three outs."	Lauer didn't quite go the distance, coming within one out of his first career complete game before allowing Max Muncy's home run. Manager Andy Green decided the 115-pitch performance was enough. Kirby Yates came on and struck out All-Star Matt Kemp to seal the Padres' 4-1 victory Tuesday night.	Green said he wanted Lauer to experience the emotion of going out for the ninth. After Muncy's home run, Green said Lauer at least deserved a conversation before the manager decided that the rookie, backed by home runs by Wil Myers and Austin Hedges, had done enough.	"He knows those feelings. Hopefully those feelings push him the next time he's out there. One more out to get the next time. Can't leave that out in front of you. I thought he was great all the way through," Green said.	"It was cool to experience that," Lauer said. "I haven't experienced it yet. It was my first time so hopefully I'll get to experience it more. ... That's big for a starting pitcher. You don't get there too often. To know what's going to happen, how it will feel, it will start to feel like just another inning, hopefully."	Lauer (5-5) took a three-hit shutout into the ninth inning after having thrown 101 pitches. He got Enrique Hernandez to fly out to center and Justin Turner to fly out to deep left before Muncy drove a 1-1 pitch into the seats in left, his 21st.	Lauer, 23, said almost getting the complete game ranked just behind the no-hitter he threw at Kent State in 2016, just a few weeks before the Padres took with him with the 26th pick overall in the amateur draft.	"A little more satisfying," he said. "I feel like I had really good command of all my pitches and it's the first time I really had four, five pitches working. I don't think I threw a changeup today, but it was still in the back of my mind that I had it available."	Lauer struck out a career-high eight and walked two in winning consecutive starts for the first time. He also had his ninth pickoff of the season, nabbing Muncy in the second after a leadoff walk.	"The fastball velo was up a couple ticks than it normally is," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said about Lauer. "He was beating us with the fastball. I thought there were some well-hit balls tonight. ... Munce put a good swing late. But we really didn't threaten all night."	Lauer improved to 2-0 against Los Angeles.	"It's the Dodgers, man," he said. "Nobody likes the Dodgers. You want to get them a little more than any other team. I've been fortunate to do good against them so far. Hopefully I can keep it rolling against them," he said.	Myers homered for the sixth time in four games and Hedges had a three-run shot.	Myers, who has played in only 28 games this season due to injuries, has heated up after a second stint on the disabled list. He hit three home runs Saturday in a 20-5 loss at Arizona, hit another in the 16th inning on Sunday to give the Padres a 4-3 win over the Diamondbacks, and then homered in the ninth inning of an 8-2 loss to Clayton Kershaw and the Dodgers on Monday night.	His homer Tuesday night, to left-center on a 2-1 pitch off Rich Hill, (2-4), was his eighth overall.	Hedges hit his fourth of the season earlier in the inning, off the Western Metal Supply Co. brick warehouse in the left field corner at Petco Park on a 1-2 pitch. Jose Pirela drew a leadoff walk and Freddy Galvis singled ahead of Hedges' homer.	Eric Hosmer just missed homering in the third, when center fielder Cody Bellinger leaped to make the catch at the fence.	Hill allowed four runs and eight hits in seven innings, struck out seven and walked one.	"I'm tired of losing. I hate losing," Hill said. "When you have good stuff and, unfortunately things just don't go your way, I mean, obviously that's the game, but it just (stinks) to lose. Something that really eats at me."	The teams finished the game in a quick 2 hours, 18 minutes.	Padres center fielder Manuel Margot made a nice diving catch of Justin Turner's fly ball in the seventh and then made a sliding catch of Chris Taylor's sinking liner to end the eighth.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: RHP Kenta Maeda (5-5, 3.24), the scheduled starter for the third game in the four-game series, is 4-3 with a 4.70 ERA in 10 career starts against San Diego.	Padres: Rookie LHP Joey Lucchesi (4-4, 3.27) is 1-1 with a 1.26 ERA in his last three starts.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Even after his first three-hit game of the season and a home run, Kevin Kiermaier knew the focus deserved to be elsewhere Wednesday after the Tampa Bay Rays completed a three-game sweep of the Detroit Tigers with a 4-2 victory.	C.J. Cron's three-run home run in the seventh inning carried the Rays to their fifth straight win, and five pitchers held the opponent to two runs or fewer for the 12th time in the Rays' past 15 home games, in which they are 14-1.	"These past couple of weeks have shown you that we can compete with the best teams in baseball," Kiermaier said. "You see a lot of people growing in here, and it starts with our pitching staff and what they've done."	The Rays' "bullpen-days" formula is "different from what any other team has ever done in the history of the game," Kiermaier added, "and we've found a way to make it work."	Cron's 18th homer came off Jordan Zimmermann after singles by Kiermaier and Matt Duffy.	It turned a gritty start by Zimmermann (4-1) into a loss, and the Tigers right-hander blamed himself for challenging Cron on a 2-0 pitch.	"My stubbornness came in and I thought `Throw the slider now on the (outside) corner, paint it and get this guy out," Zimmermann said. "Of course, those are the ones you hang. Three-run homer and we lose the game."	Cron and Kiermaier each had three hits for the Rays, who have won 14 of 18, and Joey Wendle extended his hitting streak to 11 games with double.	It was only the second multi-hit game of the season for Kiermaier, who came into the game with a .157 average in 30 games.	"It looks like he's starting to turn the corner a little bit and get his season going," Rays manager Kevin Cash said.	"Here we are in mid-July and his numbers are what they are. But look at the wins we've had since he's been back. It's been pretty telling."	James McCann's two-run homer off Matt Andriese in the fourth had given Detroit a 2-1 lead that lasted until Cron's homer. It was McCann's sixth homer of the season.	The Tigers, who struck out 14 times against five Tampa Bay pitchers, have lost four straight and 18 of 22.	Rookie left-hander Ryan Yarbrough (8-4) got the win after giving up one hit in three innings of relief. Sergio Romo pitched the ninth for his 11th save in 16 opportunities.	Zimmermann (4-1) gave up four runs and 11 hits in 6 2/3 innings, striking out five. He threw a season-high 105 pitches.	The Rays' Hunter Wood pitched one inning in his first major league start, giving up two hits while striking out two.	IN THE MINORS	Rays prospect Brendan McKay allowed one run, two hits, one walk and struck out two over two innings for the Gulf Coast League Rays in his first start since being sidelined a month because of an oblique injury. McKay, who was on the Class A Charlotte disabled list, returned as the DH Monday.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: SS Jose Iglesias was out of the lineup with a bruised left hand after being hit by a pitch Tuesday night. ... RHP Shane Greene (right shoulder strain) will be activated before Friday. RHP Victor Alcantara was optioned to Triple-A Toledo to open the roster spot.	Rays: LHP Jose Alvarado left the team because of a "personal, medical issue with a family member," according to manager Kevin Cash. ... RHP Jake Faria (left oblique strain) will make his second rehab start Thursday for Triple-A Durham.	UP NEXT	Tigers: RHP Mike Fiers (6-5, 3.65) will pitch the opener of a three-game series at Houston on Friday night.	Rays: LHP Blake Snell (12-4, league-leading 2.09 ERA) will face the Minnesota Twins on Thursday night in the opener of a four-game series.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

PITTSBURGH --  Starling Marte did not start any of the first three games of July because Pirates manager Clint Hurdle felt his slumping center fielder needed a mental break.	The strategy worked, even if Marte still doesn't agree with it.	Marte hit a two-run home run and Trevor Williams combined with four relievers on a five-hitter as Pittsburgh beat the Washington Nationals 2-0 on Wednesday.	Marte homered to deep center field, his 11th, with two outs in the third off Gio Gonzalez after Jordy Mercer led off the inning with the first of his two doubles. That was enough to give the Pirates just their third win in nine games.	Since returning to the lineup, Marte has a least a hit in all seven games, going 12 for 26 (.462).	"Personally, I don't think it's to my benefit to have days off," Marte said through a translator. "I like to play every day, but I do realize there are pros to having days off and I've been reaping the benefits of it over the last week."	"It gave him some time to work of his (hitting) approach and iron some things out," Hurdle said. "He hit the reset button, got a fresh start."	Williams (7-7) won for just the second time in his past 10 starts, giving up four hits with three strikeouts and three walks. He is 2-5 with a 6.26 ERA in that span after going 5-2 with a 2.72 ERA in his first nine outings.	"The ball seemed to be coming out of my hand better," Williams said. "I was executing pitches. That's always the key, whether you throw 101 (mph) or 85. You have to execute pitches to be successful."	Gonzalez (6-6) remained winless since May 28 despite allowing just two runs, six hits and one walk while striking out four. The left-hander is 0-4 in his past eight starts.	Though disappointed by the outcome, Gonzalez was heartened by his performance.	"That's a great, great start for me in the right direction," he said. "This is one of those games you want to put behind you and move forward, but for me, this is a personal step forward and I love that."	Washington (46-46) lost for the 11th time in 16 games and fell back to .500, scoring 20 runs in the losses and 57 runs in the wins. The Nationals entered the season as favorites to win a third consecutive NL East title.	"Consistency is the name of the game," first-year manager Dave Martinez said. "The one day we hit, we score a lot. One day, we don't."	Richard Rodriguez, Edgar Santana, Kyle Crick and Felipe Vazquez followed Williams with one scoreless inning each. Vazquez earned his 20th save in 24 opportunities.	"I thought (Williams) probably had one more inning in him, but I liked the matchups with our bullpen and thought that was the best way to win the game," Hurdle said.	Pittsburgh's David Freese had two hits.	NEW BATS FOR BRYCE	A new shipment of bats was in the clubhouse when Nationals CF Bryce Harper arrived at the ballpark, a day after striking out four times in a 5-1 loss on Tuesday.	The bats didn't help much, though, as Harper went 0 for 2 with two walks and a strikeout. His batting average is now .213, though he has 22 home runs.	"Don't let the batting average fool you," Williams said. "He can hit the ball out of the ballpark at any time."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: RHP Stephen Strasburg (right shoulder inflammation) is scheduled for a second rehab start Sunday with a team to be determined. Strasburg threw 57 pitches in 3 1/3 innings Tuesday night for Class A Potomac and his fastball topped out at 98 mph. ... 1B Ryan Zimmerman (strained right oblique) is likely to begin a rehab assignment Monday.	Pirates: RHP Chad Kuhl (strained right forearm) was examined by New York Mets medical director Dr. David Altchek in New York and advised not to throw for four weeks. ... There is no timetable for the return of INF/OF Sean Rodriguez (strained right quadriceps), who is on a rehab assignment at Triple-A Indianapolis.	UP NEXT	Nationals: RHP Max Scherzer (11-5, 2.33 ERA) is scheduled to start Thursday night against Mets LHP Steven Matz (4-6, 3.31) in the opener of a four-game series at New York. Scherzer ended a four-game losing streak Saturday when he beat Miami, allowing four runs in seven innings.	Pirates: Open an unusual five-game series against visiting Milwaukee as RHP Jameson Taillon (5-7, 4.05) opposes LHP Wade Miley (1-0, 1.42). Taillon is 1-4 against the Brewers.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

MINNEAPOLIS --  If this is Brian Dozier's last month with the Minnesota Twins, it's off to a strong start.	Whether he is helping boost the Twins back into the division race or merely increasing his trade value, Dozier has found his form at the plate.	Dozier hit a two-run homer, going deep for the second straight game to help the Twins beat the Kansas City Royals 8-5 on Wednesday.	"About stats, talk to me in October. If they're not there, then we'll talk," Dozier said. "I keep telling these guys, `Eight games: That's not that much."	Lance Lynn (7-7) recovered from a three-run homer by Salvador Perez in the first inning to win his second straight start for the Twins, who used the bottom third of their lineup to launch rallies in the second and the fourth against Burch Smith (0-1).	Max Kepler, Jake Cave and Bobby Wilson went 6 for 11 with five runs scored. Wilson, whose batting average fell to .114 last week, had two RBI and was one of three Twins with three hits, joining Dozier and Joe Mauer. Wilson, the backup catcher, is now hitting .169.	Dozier drove in a run with an infield single in the fourth. Then he sent his 15th homer of the season into the second deck above left field in the sixth inning against Enny Romero. Logan Morrison hit a solo shot one out later to pad the lead for Minnesota, which improved 6-1 on an 11-game homestand.	With the Twins trailing AL Central-leading Cleveland by 8 1/2 games when the day began, Dozier is among several prominent players on expiring contracts whose names are part of the annual July trade market speculation. Lynn is one of those, too.	"We don't pay attention to it, so whatever happens happens," said Lynn, who pitched to two batters in the sixth. "In this game I've learned that you go where you told, because they pay you. That's just the way it works, unless you've got a no-trade clause."	Only first baseman Joe Mauer has that.	"So everyone else can just wear it and do what they're told," Lynn said.	Mike Moustakas homered twice for the Royals, who took the Twins deep five times over the last two games of this series despite toting the fewest home runs in MLB. Kansas City has lost 23 of its past 27 games.	"Come in here and play hard," Perez said. "One of the things everybody should think: That's how we bring food to the table for our family. That's our job."	BULL DOZIER	Dozier's production at the plate is lower than it has been in at least five years, but he has begun to warm up with a .375 batting average, three homers and eight RBI over his past six games. Only four of his home runs have come at home this season. He hit 127 homers over the previous four years, with 63 of those at Target Field.	"You just ride the wave. Sometimes they find the green grass, sometimes they find the seats, sometimes you're walking back with your head down," he said.	BURCH IS BACK	After 24 relief appearances this year, Smith made his first major league start since 2013, when he was with San Diego. Forearm and elbow injuries kept him from pitching in 2015 and 2016, and he spent last season with the Tampa Bay organization.	"It was definitely special. Today had been a long time," said Smith, who gave up seven hits in 3 1/3 innings. "It meant a lot just getting the opportunity to do it again. I was feeling a lot of emotions going into that game."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals: RHP Jason Adam was recalled from Triple-A Omaha to take the spot of a discouraged RHP Ian Kennedy, who returned to the disabled list with a strained left oblique after an injury-shortened three-inning start on Tuesday night. Adam had been sent down the day before so Kennedy, who has gone 16 turns without a victory, could be reinstated.	Twins: RHP Addison Reed was placed on the DL with tightness in his right triceps, and RHP Alan Busenitz was recalled from Triple-A Rochester for the third time this season. ... INF Ehire Adrianza is on track to come off the DL on Thursday, after missing 10 games with a strained left hamstring.	UP NEXT	Royals: Following a day off, rookie RHP Brad Keller (2-3, 2.52 ERA) pitches in the opener of a three-game series at Chicago on Friday night for his eighth start of the season. Former Kansas City RHP James Shields (3-10, 4.53 ERA) takes the mound for the White Sox.	Twins: RHP Kyle Gibson (3-6, 3.59 ERA) starts a four-game series against Tampa Bay on Thursday night. LHP Blake Snell (12-4, 2.09 ERA) takes the mound for the Rays with the second-lowest ERA in league. Snell has won four straight starts with just two runs allowed in his past 28 2/3 innings.	---	For more AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Buster Posey would prefer not to discuss his inflamed right hip, and notes that if it wasn't the reason he has to skip the All-Star Game it might still be a secret that he needs an injection once the first half wraps up this weekend.	It has affected him hitting and behind the plate.	That's what made Posey's game-ending hit all the more impressive.	Posey singled off the right-field wall with two outs in the 13th inning for his fifth career game-ending hit, sending the San Francisco Giants past the Chicago Cubs 5-4 on Wednesday.	"Catchers are a whole different breed," said rookie Dereck Rodriguez, son of Hall of Famer Ivan Rodriguez. "They get banged up back there and go like it's nothing."	Rodriguez (4-1) pitched three scoreless innings for the win. He also had three of San Francisco's 16 strikeouts.	Brandon Belt drew a two-out walk from James Norwood (0-1). Andrew McCutchen then singled to bring up Posey, who ended the 4-hour, 30-minute game with San Francisco's first run since scoring four in the first.	"With two strikes, you're just kind of in battle mode," Posey said.	Norwood worked the 12th and 13th in his major league debut. He immediately struck out Brandon Crawford on a 99 mph fastball.	Cubs slugger Kris Bryant hit a two-run homer in his return from the disabled list, and All-Star Javier Baez tied the game with a solo homer in the seventh.	Tony Watson's scoreless streak at home ended at 20 2/3 innings with Baez's 18th homer -- and Watson hadn't allowed a run in 18 innings overall, which had been the longest active streak in baseball.	San Francisco's Johnny Cueto struck out seven in five innings in his second start back from a lengthy trip to the disabled list with a sprained elbow. The right-hander hasn't won since April 28.	Cueto was under a careful watch in just his seventh start of 2018 because of two trips to the DL.	Bryant hit his 10th homer in the fifth following a single by Jason Heyward, who homered leading off the third.	Out since June 23 with inflammation in his left shoulder, Bryant rejoined the Cubs from his Double-A rehab assignment. The 2016 NL MVP started at third base before moving to right field in the ninth.	"If I can find a way to hit the ball on the fat part of the bat more often then I'll have a lot more home runs," Bryant said. "It's as simple as that. It felt good. Unfortunately it was a tough game to lose."	The Cubs missed a chance when they loaded the bases in the sixth.	Heyward wound up with three hits on a day former Cubs catcher Miguel Montero attended the game to see his old club. Montero, let go by the Nationals after playing only four games this spring, posted on Twitter: "I had always speak my mind and today I have to say I miss this team, let's go cubs."	Some of San Francisco's more unheralded contributors staked Cueto to an early cushion.	Chase D'Arnaud homered to begin the first inning for the Giants, the first leadoff drive of his career. Gorkys Hernandez hit a two-run double before Steven Duggar singled him home.	Cubs starter Mike Montgomery gave up eight hits in five innings. He has never beaten the Giants in three starts.	BELT QUIP	Brandon Belt thanked the fans, his teammates and San Francisco's social media crew for the efforts to get him in the All-Star Game even though he lost out to Milwaukee's Jesus Aguilar in the final vote.	"I was told Russia actually interfered with this election," Belt quipped.	FLAN ON THE MIC	Former Giants third base coach, current analyst and talented musician Tim Flannery went the distance as the public address announcer while regular Renel Brooks-Moon participated in San Francisco Mayor-Elect London Breed's inauguration.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: While RHP reliever Steve Cishek is always willing to work, he was unavailable after working three straight games and 2 1/3 innings -- taking the loss in 11 innings Monday night before earning his third save Tuesday night when Brandon Morrow wasn't available. ... Jon Lester will start Sunday for the Cubs, putting his availability for the All-Star Game in question. Manager Joe Maddon said he'd leave it up to Lester whether to pitch for the NL squad.	Giants: Posey, who will have an injection in his troublesome right hip after Sunday's game and sit out the All-Star Game, returned to the lineup after a pinch-hit appearance Tuesday.	UP NEXT	Cubs: Following an off day, RHP Tyler Chatwood (3-5, 5.01 ERA) starts Friday at San Diego. Chatwood is looking for his first win in 10 starts since beating the White Sox on May 11.	Giants: LHP Madison Bumgarner (2-3, 3.09 ERA) pitches Friday in the Bay Bridge Series opener against the Oakland Athletics.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

BOSTON --  Chris Sale came off the mound, yelling something into his glove that wasn't fit for his mother's ears.	It wasn't another strikeout that got him fired up, though he had 12 of those on Wednesday night. It was a comebacker that he stabbed out of the air to start an inning-ending double play.	"Sometimes, the ball catches you," he said after leading the Red Sox to their ninth straight win, a 4-2 victory over the Texas Rangers. "Anybody out there would be fired up."	Sale pitched seven innings of shutout ball in his final start before the All-Star Game, and major league batting leader Mookie Betts had two hits for Boston. J.D. Martinez had a pair of RBI to pad his major league-leading total of 79 as the Red Sox improved to 36 games above .500 for the first time since Bucky Dent homered over the Green Monster in a one-game playoff to settle the 1978 AL East title.	"We don't care where we're at or who we're facing," said Sale (10-4), who allowed six hits and walked one to win his fifth straight decision. "We come to win games, and that's all you can expect."	Bartolo Colon (5-7) allowed four runs -- three earned -- on nine hits and two walks, striking out three in six innings. Elvis Andrus had three hits for the Rangers, who struck out 18 times to lose for the fifth time in six games.	Andrus doubled to lead off the sixth, and then Nomar Mazara singled before Sale struck out Adrian Beltre. Rougned Odor hit a hard chopper back up the middle that Sale snagged, throwing to second to start the double play.	He walked off the mound shouting into his glove. Asked what he was yelling, he said, "My mom watches this. I can't say that."	Xander Bogaerts had three hits for the Red Sox, who have won 14 of 16 games. It's the second nine-game winning streak for the Red Sox this season; they also won nine straight after losing on opening day.	CLOSING TIME	The Red Sox took a 4-0 lead into the eighth before Texas scored one off Heath Hembree and loaded the bases; Craig Kimbrel walked in a second run but then struck out Joey Gallo to end the inning.	He struck out the side in the ninth for his 28th save, and his 19th in a row.	"Good pitches there to Gallo," Red Sox manager Alex Cora said. "And then he came back and dominated."	DANGER ZONE	The Rangers had difficulty with three different popups in shallow center field.	In the second, Eduardo Nunez reached on an error by second baseman Rougned Odor that scored Bogaerts to make it 1-0. After Martinez already drove in a pair of runs with a fifth-inning double, Bogaerts lofted one to left-center that caused a collision between left fielder Gallo and center fielder Delino Deshields, resulting in an RBI triple.	Nunez blooped another one into center in the sixth that Deshields dove for. Nunez was thrown out trying to stretch it into a double.	"The challenge is when the ball isn't in the air long enough to make the catch," Rangers manager Jef Banister said.	NO BENNY	Red Sox left fielder Andrew Benintendi finished second in the voting for the final spot on the AL All-Star roster, losing out to Seattle shortstop Jean Segura. Benintendi had two hits on Wednesday for his sixth straight multi-hit game. He also scored for the sixth game in a row but failed to double, ending a streak of five straight games.	FOR SALE	Sale made his 200th career start. ... It was the 11th time in his 20 starts this season he gave up one run or none. ... It was his ninth game this season with at least 10 strikeouts and his fifth straight with at least 11 strikeouts and no more than one walk.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: Deshields left the game after diving for Nunez's bloop in the sixth inning. He was evaluated for neck and shoulder problems. Later the same inning, Odor talked to the training staff after stretching awkwardly to hold the bag on a force at second.	"He's being evaluated; back, upper-neck area," Banister said after the game. "I just took him out to be evaluated."	Red Sox: 2B Dustin Pedroia was scheduled to return home to Arizona to continue his rehab from left knee surgery.	UP NEXT	Rangers: Off Thursday, visit Baltimore on Friday, when LHP Cole Hamels (5-6) faces RHP Alex Cobb (2-11).	Red Sox: Host Toronto on Thursday, with David Price (9-6) facing a Blue Jays pitcher TBA.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BALTIMORE --  After spending three days at Camden Yards, Greg Bird and Sonny Gray left town feeling a whole lot better than when they arrived.	Bird hit his first career grand slam to back a dominating pitching performance by Gray, and the New York Yankees beat the Baltimore Orioles 9-0 Wednesday night for a split of the four-game series.	Facing Dylan Bundy (6-9) in the third inning, Bird launched a drive off the right-field foul pole to put New York up 5-0. It was the second night in a row he homered and had four RBI.	The big first baseman came to Baltimore with nine RBI, and doubled that total during this series.	"Him playing well is a big deal for us," manager Aaron Boone said. "Hopefully we're starting to see him get settled in and having some impact at bats."	Gray (6-7) allowed three hits, walked one and struck out eight over six innings. The right-hander had lost three straight starts, the last two in which he gave up a collective 11 runs over 4 1/3 innings.	Facing the last-place Orioles couldn't have come at a better time for Gray. He's 3-0 with a 2.00 ERA against Baltimore and 3-7 with a 6.32 ERA against everyone else.	"When you're going through some things, I think it's important to get back to your strengths," Gray said. "My two-seam and my curveball have always been something I've been able to rely on throughout my career, going back to college. I think to simplify things and go back to your strengths, that's all we tried to do today."	It worked quite well.	"Sonny Gray is too good a pitcher to stay where he was all year, and I think he made some adjustments," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. "He looked physically strong tonight."	The victory enabled the Yankees to improve to 5-5 against the Orioles this season. In this series, Baltimore won 5-4 and 6-5, and New York's wins were by a total of 17 runs.	Rookie Tyler Wade and Austin Romine also homered for the Yankees, and Giancarlo Stanton had four hits.	In the pivotal third inning, Stanton singled in a run before Bird ended a nine-pitch at-bat by pulling a curveball down the line.	"I feel like gradually it's coming," Bird said. "I can feel it on a swing here and there, and it's just been better and more consistent."	Wade went deep in the sixth, and Romine connected in the seventh. Wade's long ball, his first in the big leagues, came on his 100th at-bat.	New York has 154 home runs this season, a major league record before the All-Star break. The Yankees have played 91 games; the 1999 Seattle Mariners hit 151 in 87 games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: Boone said LHP Aroldis Chapman (left knee) is "good to go." Chapman has not pitched since leaving in the ninth inning Saturday at Toronto. ... C Gary Sanchez, on the disabled list since June 25 with a right groin strain, ran and did catching work Wednesday. "I would say he's getting closer," Boone said.	Orioles: RHP Andrew Cashner was placed on the 10-day disabled list with a neck strain. He's not expected to miss more than one start. ... RHP Chris Tillman (back) is slated to conclude his rehab assignment Sunday with Triple-A Norfolk, although manager Buck Showalter floated the idea of starting him in place of Cashner vs. Texas on Sunday.	MOVING PIECES	Manny Machado insists he's a shortstop. But if he gets traded by the Orioles to the Yankees before the July 31 non-waiver trade deadline -- one of the many rumors out there -- New York could ask him to play 3B next to Didi Gregorius. So where does that leave Yankees 3B Miguel Andujar?  "Those are things I have no control over," Andujar said through an interpreter. "I don't pay attention to that stuff." Neither does Boone, who said, "When you're in a pennant chase, there's going to be stories that are real, fake, everything."	UP NEXT	Yankees: RHP Luis Severino (14-2, 2.12 ERA) seeks to add to his major league-leading win total Thursday night in the opener of a four-game series in Cleveland.	Orioles: RHP Kevin Gausman (4-6, 4.11) starts against Philadelphia on Thursday night at Camden Yards in the makeup game of a May 15 rainout.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

CLEVELAND --  Jose Ramirez is skipping the Home Run Derby. He's not missing much else right now.	Ramirez homered twice to match Albert Belle's club record for home runs before the All-Star break and the Cleveland Indians took out some frustrations following a brutal loss with a 19-4 thumping of the Cincinnati Reds on Wednesday night.	Ramirez hit a two-run homer in the first inning off Tyler Mahle (7-7) and connected for a three-run shot in Cleveland's nine-run third. With the Indians up 17-0, the All-Star third baseman was replaced in the fifth inning by manager Terry Francona before he could inflict further damage.	"He's a monster," Francona said of Ramirez. "And he's getting better."	Ramirez was invited to participate in Monday's home-run contest, the signature event of All-Star festivities. However, the 25-year-old, who was voted a starter for the second straight year, declined a chance to take his cuts against Bryce Harper and others next week in Washington D.C.	He's got bigger swings to make.	"I sat down with the team and we made a decision, all of us together, and we just decided it wasn't the best thing for me to do at this time," Ramirez said through an interpreter. "It's a long season. I'm a player that plays every day and I need to save energy for the second half and, God willing, the playoffs as well."	Francona said Ramirez had the team's blessing if he wanted to take part. And if he had, Indians All-Star shortstop Francisco Lindor was betting on his teammate.	"I had him winning the Derby, believe it or not," said Lindor, who added a three-run homer in the fourth. "I had him going all the way to the finals. I truly believe in his bat. I truly believe in his bat control. Believe it or not, the Derby right now is not about how strong you are. It's about who has the most bat control and I think Josey is one of the best at that.	"I think he had a really good chance of winning."	Jason Kipnis also homered as the Indians salvaged the interleague series finale by pounding their neighbors from southern Ohio and ending a four-game slide.	For the Indians, it was a much-needed rebound after they squandered a 4-0 lead in the ninth on Tuesday night, when Francona's miscommunication with pitching coach Carl Willis on a choice of relievers helped the Reds rally for seven runs and stun the Indians.	"It was terrific -- on a lot of fronts," Francona said. "I think they tried to take me out of it, which is OK. We struck early and we kept going."	Carlos Carrasco (10-5) reached 1,000 career strikeouts, and given the humongous lead, coasted through five innings for his second straight win since coming off the disabled list. Adam Plutko worked four innings for his first career save.	Jesse Winker and Scooter Gennett homered for the Reds.	"It feels like a couple of losses when you get beat that bad," said Cincinnati interim manager Jim Riggleman. "But it's a loss and unfortunately some guys' personal numbers get affected. But other than that we'll shake it off, and take the day off and go get them in St. Louis."	DYNAMIC DUO	Lindor connected in the fourth for his 25th homer. The Indians said Ramirez and Lindor are the first pair of teammates under 25 to hit at least 25 homers before the break.	"It's a pretty good tandem right there," Francona said. "They do it in a little different ways. But they're switch-hitters. They're both on that side of the infield, and they're young and they are really good."	LATE RELIEF	Reds third baseman Alex Blandino made his major league pitching debut in the eighth. He allowed one hit and struck out two.	"I always thought it was fun to pitch," Blandino said of his first stint on the mound since he was a high school senior. "I think it went pretty well. I was happy just to get out of the inning. I was trying to throw strikes."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: RHP Homer Bailey (right knee), who has been on the disabled list since June 2, will make two more rehab starts with Triple-A Louisville. Bailey has made five rehab appearances, including four starts. After one relief appearance, general manager Nick Krall said the team decided it was "best if we left him as a starter," and that Bailey will rejoin the Reds' rotation when he completes his rehab stint.	Indians: LHP Andrew Miller threw 39 pitches off the Progressive Field mound, a significant step in his recovery from knee inflammation. The club's top reliever has been out since May 26. Next for Miller is facing hitters, and the Indians hope to have the left-hander match up with some minor leaguers this weekend before they consider activating him after the All-Star break.	UP NEXT	Reds: Following an off day, RHP Matt Harvey opens a three-game series in St. Louis against right-hander Carlos Martinez. Harvey has been something of a good luck charm as Cincinnati was just 8-27 before he was acquired on May 8.	Indians: In a matchup of two of baseball's best, Corey Kluber (12-4) starts the opener of a four-game series against New York and Yankees ace Luis Severino (14-2). Kluber is 5-1 with a 1.80 ERA in seven career regular-season starts against the Bronx Bombers.

NEW YORK --  Brandon Nimmo's last walk-off home run came with Triple-A Las Vegas to end a 12-inning game in 2016. But current teammate Jay Bruce told him it only counts if you do it in the big leagues.	Problem solved.	Nimmo launched a pinch-hit, three-run homer in the bottom of the 10th inning and the New York Mets got another dominant outing from All-Star Jacob deGrom in a 3-0 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Wednesday night.	It was New York's third game-ending homer in the last six days. Jose Bautista beat Tampa Bay with a grand slam last Friday, and Mets walk-off record-holder Wilmer Flores connected Monday in the series opener against the Phillies.	"I just kind of blacked out, swung, closed my eyes and it just kind of worked out," Nimmo said with a huge grin. "Now I know how Flo feels all the time. Just trying to be like him."	Amed Rosario, who had two of New York's four hits, began the winning rally with a two-out double off Mark Leiter Jr. (0-1) -- the first hit for the Mets since the fourth inning. Jose Reyes walked and Nimmo drove Leiter's next pitch well over the wall in right-center for his first career walk-off RBI.	Before his big home run, Nimmo was in a 6-for-46 slump with 20 strikeouts during that stretch. Beaming as he rounded the bases, he was pelted in the face with a bucket of bubble gum by excited teammates as they waited to swarm him at home plate.	"You're just floating," Nimmo said. "All the hairs on the back of your neck are standing up. I was just extremely elated."	New York won for only the fifth time in its past 24 home games. The Mets earned a four-game split but have gone 15 consecutive series without winning one since sweeping a three-game set against Arizona from May 18-20.	Philadelphia dropped back into a first-place tie with Atlanta in the NL East.	In his final scheduled start before heading to the All-Star Game next Tuesday in Washington, deGrom scattered five hits over eight innings and matched his longest outing of the season. He struck out seven and lowered his major league-leading ERA to 1.68, tied with Dwight Gooden (1985) for the best by a Mets starter before the All-Star break.	"He should be starting the All-Star Game," New York manager Mickey Callaway said. "There's no doubt in my mind. If he's not, then that's the wrong decision. That would be the bow for me."	Despite all his success, deGrom has only five wins this season. The right-hander has consistently been hurt by poor run support from an anemic New York lineup.	"I think the most impressive part is his ability to not worry about the lack of offense behind him," Callaway said. "Most people can't just sit there and weather the storm like that."	This time, at least, the Mets didn't let deGrom's gem go to waste.	Phillies starter Vince Velasquez returned from the disabled list and matched deGrom, allowing two hits over six scoreless innings. The right-hander missed only one start after being hit just below the right elbow by a line drive on June 30.	"Super tough loss," Philadelphia manager Gabe Kapler said. "(Velasquez) went toe-to-toe with one of the best pitchers in baseball. He did as good of a job as we could have possibly asked of him coming off 10 days down, really giving us everything he had."	The Phillies had a threat mounting in the 10th, but catcher Andrew Knapp was thrown out attempting to move from first to third on Cesar Hernandez's infield single.	"We teach aggressiveness," Kapler said. "He made an aggressive play and I stand behind it."	Robert Gsellman (6-2) pitched a scoreless inning for the win.	MAJIC MAN	Longtime New York Mets radio broadcast engineer Chris Majkowski threw out the ceremonial first pitch. A 25-year veteran, "Maj" has not missed a game since Aug. 8, 1993 -- a string of 4,011 consecutive games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: RHP Luis Garcia (right wrist strain) will pitch for Triple-A Lehigh Valley on Friday and Sunday and then will be re-evaluated. ... OF Rhys Hoskins went through concussion protocol after crashing into the left-field wall Tuesday, but was cleared and was in the starting lineup. He went 0 for 3 with a walk.	Mets: 2B Asdrubal Cabrera (left elbow) was held out of the starting lineup after aggravating a previously hyperextended elbow. He drew an intentional walk as a pinch-hitter in the eighth. ... RHP Noah Syndergaard (finger) threw a successful bullpen and "felt great," according to Callaway. Syndergaard is expected to come off the disabled list to start Friday against Washington. He has not pitched in the majors since May 25. ... OF Yoenis Cespedes (right hip flexor strain) is still unable to fully run the bases. The ailing slugger is only able to run straight ahead, and a start date for a rehab stint remains unclear. ... LHP Jason Vargas (strained right calf) will make another rehab start with Class A Brooklyn on Saturday. Callaway indicated the team would like to see Vargas' pitch count reach 90 before he is activated.	UP NEXT	Phillies: RHP Nick Pivetta (5-7, 4.62 ERA) opposes RHP Kevin Gausman (4-6, 4.11) when Philadelphia visits Baltimore on Thursday night to make up a May 15 postponement. Pivetta has struggled in his last two starts, allowing eight earned runs in 4 1/3 innings.	Mets: LHP Steven Matz (4-6, 3.31 ERA) takes on All-Star Max Scherzer (11-5, 2.33) as New York welcomes Washington to Citi Field to open a four-game series Thursday. Matz has allowed just one earned run over his last two starts and opponents are hitless in their last 26 at-bats against him with runners on.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

MIAMI --  Jesus Aguilar hit like the All-Star he is, while the rest of the Milwaukee Brewers hit like also-rans.	Aguilar was added to the NL All-Star team Wednesday night and then validated the selection with three hits and three RBI, but his teammates went 1 for 14 with runners in scoring position and Milwaukee lost 5-4 to the Miami Marlins in 12 innings.	"That's going to happen," Aguilar said. "We've got to keep going. We're playing really good. We've got to turn the page."	Starlin Castro singled home the winning run with one out in the 12th.	Aguilar doubled home a run in the first, singled in the fourth and hit a tying, two-run double in the eighth against Drew Steckenrider. He also learned he won the online vote for the final NL roster spot and his first All-Star berth.	"A lot of people believe in my name," the Venezuelan said. "It's really good. The campaign was unbelievable -- the people in Wisconsin and around the world really supported me. It's a great thing."	Aguilar, who will also compete as the top seed in the Home Run Derby next week in Washington, came into the game leading the NL in homers, slugging and OPS. He has 67 RBI and is batting .307.	Miami's Garrett Cooper led off the 12th with a single against Jorge Lopez (0-1) and went to second on a groundout. Castro then grounded a single to left field and Christian Yelich's throw home was off line, allowing Cooper to score standing up.	"Yelich is a really good player, but his one downfall is he doesn't throw great," Marlins manager Don Mattingly said. "You've got to challenge there and make him throw you out."	The Marlins took two of three in the series from the NL Central leaders, winning twice in extra innings.	"We're knocking on the doorstep and making it really hard to take us down," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. "But they outlasted us tonight."	The Marlins, who have the NL's worst record, hit a new attendance low. The crowd of 5,265 was the smallest in the seven-season history of Marlins Park, and a few hundred fans remained at the finish.	The 4 1/2-hour marathon wasn't what the Brewers needed as they near the end of a stretch in which they play 20 days in a row, including a doubleheader Saturday at Pittsburgh. Counsell said he ran out of pitchers, which is why reliever Lopez batted in the 12th with two on and two out.	"We managed to get to the 12th inning in that scenario, which was quite an accomplishment," Counsell said. "We just didn't ever get that run across."	With the score 4-all, Miami reliever Kyle Barraclough walked the bases loaded in the ninth, but Yelich struck out on a pitch in the dirt to end the threat.	Miami starter Dan Straily allowed one earned run in six innings, matched his season high with seven strikeouts and got his first RBI of the season with a bases-loaded walk. Elieser Hernandez (1-5) pitched two scoreless innings for his first career win.	Milwaukee rookie Freddy Peralta lasted only 3 2/3 innings in his shortest outing this year and allowed three runs, including Justin Bour's 15th homer.	"I've got to be better," Peralta said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers 3B Travis Shaw left the game when he tweaked his ankle, but said the injury wasn't serious.	SUPER SUB	Marlins backup catcher Bryan Holaday reached base three times, singled home a run and threw out two runners trying to steal. He started his third game in a row while All-Star J.T. Realmuto is on paternity leave.	UP NEXT	Brewers: LHP Wade Miley (1-0, 1.42 ERA), who has been sidelined with a strained right oblique, is expected to be activated to start Thursday at Pittsburgh. It will be his first outing since May 8 and only his third this year.	Marlins: After a day off, the Marlins begin a three-game series at home against the Phillies, with LHP Wei-Yin Chen (2-6, 6.14) scheduled to start Friday.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

ATLANTA --  Ozzie Albies' first career multihomer game was special.	Making his mother's wish come true was even better.	Albies snapped Atlanta's power drought with two homers, and the Braves beat the Toronto Blue Jays 9-5 on Wednesday to move back into a tie for the NL East lead.	Albies' mother, Judari, arrived from their Curacao home on Tuesday night. It was a rare opportunity for the 21-year-old second baseman to play with his mother in the stands.	He made the most of the night by fulfilling his mother's request to reach 20 homers -- a level not expected of 5-foot-8, 165-pound middle infielders.	"It feels amazing. She told me before I left Curacao she wants 20 this year," he said. "To have it right in front of her, she saw it live, so I hope she's happy today."	Albies leads the Braves in homers, even though first baseman Freddie Freeman, who has 16, will participate in next week's All-Star Home Run Derby.	"They asked me if I wanted to participate," Albies said. "I said yes. I guess I didn't make it. ... I'll bring him Gatorade."	Albies is the first Atlanta player since Andruw Jones, also a native of Curacao, in 2006 to hit 20 home runs before the All-Star break.	"It must be a Curacao thing, I guess," Albies said.	Albies, headed to his first All-Star Game next week, led off the sixth with a drive off Luis Santos that ended Atlanta's season-long stretch of five games without a homer. He also had a sacrifice fly in the Braves' six-run second.	Mike Foltynewicz (7-5) and the Braves led 7-0 before Toronto scored five runs in the seventh on Justin Smoak's leadoff homer and a grand slam by Devon Travis . But Albies hit a two-run shot in the eighth to help Atlanta hold on for just its second win in eight games.	Coupled with Philadelphia's loss to the New York Mets, the Braves moved into a tie with the Phillies for the division lead.	Foltynewicz allowed only one hit through six scoreless innings before giving up Smoak's 14th homer high into the right-field seats to open the seventh.	The Blue Jays loaded the bases with two-out singles from Lourdes Gurriel Jr., Aledmys Diaz and Luke Maile before Travis hit his third career grand slam, knocking Foltynewicz out of the game.	"After all that work, for that to happen is disappointing," Foltynewicz said.	Foltynewicz, also selected to his first All-Star Game, has completed seven innings in only two of his 18 starts this season.	A safety squeeze by Foltynewicz drove in Johan Camargo in the second. Ender Inciarte and Nick Markakis had run-scoring doubles in the inning. Freeman and Tyler Flowers singled in runs.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: LHP Jaime Garcia (sore left shoulder) is scheduled to make a rehab appearance with Class A Dunedin on Thursday. ... CF Kevin Pillar was given a day off.	Braves: Inciarte was hit near his right elbow by a pitch from Gaviglio in the first inning. He remained in the game and had a run-scoring double in the second inning before being replaced by Santana to open the fifth inning. He is not expected to miss any games.	QUICK HOOK	Toronto's Sam Gaviglio (2-3) allowed six runs in 1 2/3 innings in his shortest career start. He fell to 1/3 with an 8.72 ERA in five road starts.	CABRERA RELEASED	Mauricio Cabrera, who hasn't returned to the majors since 2016, when he recorded six saves, five wins and a 2.82 ERA with Atlanta, was released by the Braves. The hard-throwing Cabrera, 24, had an 11.03 ERA with 41 walks in 31 innings with High-A Florida.	FANNING THE DERBY TALK	Freeman will face hometown favorite Bryce Harper in the first round of the Derby at Nationals Park.	"It should be fun. I'm hoping the fans are excited for him and he gets nervous and gets a zero," Freeman said. "But we'll see what happens."	UP NEXT	Blue Jays: LHP J.A. Happ, the subject of trade rumors, will look for his 11th win when Toronto opens a four-game series at Boston on Thursday night.	Braves: Following an off day on Thursday, RHP Anibal Sanchez will take his surprising 2.72 ERA into Friday night's opening game of a weekend series against RHP Zack Godley and visiting Arizona.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

CHICAGO --  Carlos Rodon is healthy, and showing signs of rounding into the dominant starter the Chicago White Sox hoped he'd become.	Rodon pitched three-hit, shutout ball into the eighth inning to outduel Luke Weaver and lead the White Sox to a 4-0 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals on Wednesday night.	Tim Anderson tripled and had two RBI. Charlie Tilson singled in a run off reliever Mike Mayers in Chicago's two-run seventh and Jose Abreu added an RBI groundout as White Sox ended a six-game losing streak and won for just the third time in their last 13.	Rodon (2-3) allowed only two singles and a double while walking two and striking out a season-high seven though 7 1/3 innings. The 25-year-old left-hander, who spent the first two months of 2018 on the disabled list rehabbing from shoulder surgery, sparkled in just his seventh start this season.	Rodon was coming off his strongest outing this season, when he allowed two runs on five hits in a six-inning no-decision at Houston last week. So has the lefty arrived?	"I hope so," manager Rick Renteria said. "He is obviously showing tremendous signs that is the case."	In this one, Rodon looked nothing like the struggling pitcher who was plagued by left biceps bursitis to start 2017 and then underwent shoulder surgery last September.	"I got in a groove," Rodon said. "I started off a little slow and then it started to ramp up.	"Omar (catcher Narvaez) and I got on the same page with almost every pitch and it seemed like things were clicking. When I get that tempo, it goes well."	Joakim Soria got the final four outs for his 13th save in 16 chances.	Weaver (5-8) allowed one run on three hits and fanned seven his second straight impressive start. The right-hander pitched two-hit ball over a career-high eight innings last week in San Francisco.	Weaver and Rodon squared off before in college. Weaver was drafted 27th overall in 2014 out of Florida State. The White Sox picked Rodon third that year from North Carolina State.	"He looked healthy to me," Weaver said. "He had a heckuva game tonight.	"You knew it was going to be a pitchers' duel," Weaver added  "You knew he wasn't going to give up many runs, and I tried to do the same. It was a lot of fun (in college) and it was a lot of fun tonight."	Jose Martinez grounded a sharp single off Rodon with two outs in the first. Then the White Sox lefty didn't allow another hit -- and retired 14 of 15 batters -- before Matt Carpenter doubled with one out in the sixth.	The White Sox managed only three baserunners -- with Yolmer Sanchez singling twice -- before the fifth, when Chicago took a 1-0 lead.	Leury Garcia came home when Anderson grounded into a force at second.	The White Sox scored twice with two outs in the seventh to make it 3-0. Narvaez singled, then scored on Anderson's triple to the left field corner. Tilson's single plated Anderson.	The Cardinals loaded the bases with one out in the eighth to chase Rodon. Paul DeJong led off with a single, Kolten Wong reached on an error and Carpenter walked.	But Juan Minaya fanned Tommy Pham for the second out, then Soria struck out Martinez to end the threat.	The White Sox added a run in the eighth when Yoan Moncada came home on Abreu's groundout.	ALL-STAR NIX	Cardinals right-hander Miles Mikolas was removed from the National League's active roster for the All-Star Game next Tuesday because he's scheduled to start Sunday against Cincinnati. Los Angeles Dodgers righty Ross Stripling was added to the NL pitching staff Wednesday as Mikolas' replacement.	Mikolas is 10-3 with a 2.65 ERA and was selected to his first All-Star team last weekend. The 29-year-old is enjoying a resurgent season in the majors after three years in Japan.	ROSTER MOVES	The White Sox designated RHP Bruce Rondon for assignment and purchased the contract of RHP Jeanmar Gomez from Triple-A Charlotte before the game The 27-year-old Rondon went 2/3 with an 8.49 ERA and one save in 35 games. The reliever got one out and issued three walks in Tuesday night's 14-2 loss to St. Louis.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: CF Tommy Pham (bruised left ankle) was back in the lineup after being a last-minute scratch on Tuesday and struck out four times. Pham fouled a ball off his foot on Sunday. . Manager Mike Matheny said LHP Tyler Lyons (sprained left elbow) is close to returning from his rehab assignment. . RHP Luke Gregerson (right shoulder impingement) could be activated this weekend, but Matheny didn't have a date.	White Sox: RHP Nate Jones (right forearm muscle strain) tossed live batting practice on Wednesday. Jones said he felt good and threw at "90-100 percent," but the next steps in the right-hander's recovery haven't been determined . RHP Miguel Gonzales underwent right shoulder surgery in Los Angeles on Wednesday. His recovery time is expected to be nine to 12 months.	UP NEXT	Cardinals: RHP Carlos Martinez (6-4, 3.05) looks for his fourth straight win when he takes the mound against Cincinnati's Matt Harvey (4-5, 4.80) on Friday in the opener of a three-game home series.	White Sox: RHP James Shields (3-10, 4.53) squares off against Kansas City RHP Brad Kelley (2-3, 2.52) on Friday in Chicago.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

HOUSTON --  After making a habit of late comebacks this season, the Oakland Athletics enjoyed building an early lead and holding onto it.	Chad Pinder hit a three-run homer and Khris Davis added three RBI as the A's jumped on Lance McCullers Jr. early and cruised to an 8-3 victory over the Houston Astros on Wednesday night.	The A's lead the majors with 67 runs in the eighth inning or later and entering the game they'd scored the winning run in the eighth or later in nine of their last 21 wins.	"Not always coming back from behind and just winning a ballgame when we were ahead. We can do that, too," Davis said with a smile.	Davis, who extended his career-best hitting streak to 13 games, put the A's up 2-0 with a double in a three-run first. Pinder made it 6-0 when he connected off McCullers (10-4) for his ninth homer in the fourth.	Oakland manager Bob Melvin said this was a much-needed win after his team rallied from a 4-0 deficit to tie it in the ninth on Tuesday night before losing 6-5 on a bizarre play in the 11th inning.	"It shows you the grit these guys have," he said. "That's a demoralizing loss to be able to come back as far as we did last night and get beat in the fashion that we did. ... To be able to jump on their starting pitching right away showed me a lot from these guys to just move past what happened (Tuesday)."	Oakland starter Chris Bassitt (2-3) yielded five hits and three runs in five innings for his second straight win after losing his first three decisions.	Yuli Gurriel drove in two runs for Houston, and Tyler White hit a solo homer that cut the deficit to 6-3 in the fifth.	McCullers allowed four hits and six runs while walking five in four-plus innings for his first loss since May 26. It came after a stellar outing last time out, when he whiffed a career-high 12 while permitting just three hits and a run in seven innings of an 11-4 win over the White Sox.	"You could just tell he was battling himself," manager AJ Hinch said. "He just didn't have it. ... So, little bit of mechanics, a little bit of approach but more of it just he just couldn't throw the ball where he wanted to."	Things went wrong for McCullers quickly when he walked two batters with one out in the first. The A's took a 2-0 lead when both runners scored on the double by Davis. A single by Stephen Piscotty sent Davis to third and he scored on a sacrifice fly by Matt Chapman.	McCullers plunked Chapman to start the fourth before walking Mark Canha. Oakland pushed the lead to 6-0 on the homer by Pinder to left field.	Bassitt retired nine of the first 10 batters he faced, and the Astros didn't get a hit until Alex Bregman's single with nobody out in the fourth. Jose Altuve singled before Gurriel's two-run single cut the margin to 6-2.	Emilio Pagan worked two scoreless innings after Bassitt's exit.	Marcus Semien doubled with one out in the sixth and scored on a two-out triple by Davis to push the lead to 7-3. Oakland made it 8-3 on an RBI single by Josh Phegley in the ninth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: INF Marwin Gonzalez sat out after taking a cleat to the left wrist Tuesday night. He is day-to-day. ... SS Carlos Correa (back stiffness) ramped up his activity and said he's feeling good and believes he is inching closer to a return.	Athletics: Piscotty exited in the middle of the fifth inning after being hit by a pitch on the left wrist in the top of the inning. The team said his wrist was bruised and Melvin said X-rays were negative.	DEMOTED	Houston optioned reliever Ken Giles to Triple-A Fresno, a night after he appeared to curse at Hinch when he was lifted from the game. Despite that, the Astros insisted the move was about baseball and not the right-hander's behavior.	"We need to get his pitching right," Hinch said. "He's had an up-and-down season. He's had signs that things are good. He's had some bad games. He's had some meltdowns. But we need to get him right. He's not right and we've got to get him right mentally and physically to make sure he's a good contributor to a `pen."	Left-hander Cionel Perez was recalled from Double-A Corpus Christi to take Giles' roster spot and allowed two hits and a run over 1 2/3 innings in his major league debut.	DERBY BOUND	Bregman was named to the Home Run Derby field on Wednesday night. He will be the fifth Astros player to compete in the contest, joining Lance Berkman and Jeff Bagwell, who made four appearances each, Moises Alou and Glenn Davis.	"I've watched it a bunch," Bregman said. "I don't know if I've ever dreamed about being in it but definitely looking forward to it."	UP NEXT	Oakland RHP Trevor Cahill (1-2, 2.77 ERA) will come off the disabled list to start against Charlie Morton (11-2, 2.83) in the series finale Thursday. Cahill has struggled on the road this season, going 0-2 with a 5.66 ERA. Morton has won four of his last five starts.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

DENVER --  The Arizona Diamondbacks preserved their bullpen. Their psyche might have taken a big hit, however.	Arizona's Coors Field dominance ended in a blast of offense by the Colorado Rockies. Carlos Gonzalez hit two homers, starter German Marquez also went deep for one of Colorado's five home runs as the Rockies routed Arizona 19-2 on Wednesday night.	Gonzalez drove in six runs to help the Rockies end a nine-game home losing streak against the Diamondbacks. They scored 12 runs in the first three innings and only a couple of Arizona position players taking the mound settled things down.	"We've had trouble against this team, we all know it, so today was good," Nolan Arenado said.	Arizona starter Shelby Miller (0-4) allowed five runs before leaving after the first with right elbow tightness. Miller was making his fourth start since returning from Tommy John surgery and was headed back to Phoenix on Wednesday night to be evaluated, manager Torey Lovullo said.	"He definitely didn't seem himself," said Alex Avila, who started at catcher and finished the game on the mound. "He was kind of struggling to command really anything, noticing him grimacing on occasion when he'd throw a pitch. Obviously there was something wrong there."	With the game out of hand, the Diamondbacks turned to second baseman Daniel Descalso and Avila to pitch. Descalso tossed 2 2/3 innings in his fifth relief appearance. Avila threw two scoreless innings in his first time pitching since college.	"It's like riding bike," he said. "I wasn't trying to do anything special, just made sure I tired to throw strikes and that's really it."	Colorado scored seven runs off Jorge De La Rosa and four more off Yoshihisa Hirano to bring on Descalso in the fourth. He had retired the first nine batters he faced his career but Arenado greeted him with an RBI single and Gonzalez followed with a two-run homer. Descalso was the first position player in franchise history to pitch more than one inning. Avila became the second.	Charlie Blackmon and Ian Desmond also homered as Colorado ended a nine-game home losing streak to the Diamondbacks.	Marquez (8-8), who pitched six innings, hit his first career home run off Descalso that made it 19-1.	"I happened to make really good contact on that pitch and the ball left the yard," Marquez said. "I'd be lying if I sometimes (don't think) I've got to go yard at some point. I'm glad it happened tonight."	The 19 runs were the most this season for Colorado and one short of the franchise best.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: Reliever TJ McFarland left the game in the fourth inning with neck tightness. ... Lovullo said OF Jarrod Dyson (right groin strain) is dealing with the break up of scar tissue related to his 2017 hernia surgery and said the team will keep him off his feet until after the break.	Rockies: RHP Bryan Shaw was activated from the 10-day DL and LHP Jerry Vasto optioned to Triple-A Albuquerque. Shaw pitched a scoreless ninth inning in his first appearance since June 23rd.	TWO FOR THE BOOKS	The Diamondbacks made history by pitching Descalso and Avila tossing multiple innings. The last time it happened was when the Philadelphia Phillies did it against the Chicago Cubs on July 22, 1945, according to Elias Sports Bureau.	In addition, Descalso coming on in the fourth inning was the earliest a position player pitched in a game since Sal Bando did it for Milwaukee on Aug. 29, 1979, according to Elias.	WILD WEEK	The Diamondbacks will need the upcoming All-Star break to regroup from the last four games. On Saturday they scored 20 runs to beat San Diego, went 16 innings the next day against the Padres and then allowed 19 runs against Colorado.	"The 20 runs followed by 16-inning game -- I've never seen something like that," Lovullo said. "Our positions players had to cover four-plus innings. So it's a weird set of circumstances, but today only counts as one loss."	NERVOUS NOLAN	Arenado has faced the toughest pitchers in the game with confidence but facing Descalso in the fourth inning was stressful for the All-Star third baseman.	"It was awkward, my heart was beating really fast because I didn't want to get out," he said. "It was nice to get a hit."	SALAS RELEASED	The Diamondbacks released RHP Fernando Salas a few days after designating him for assignment.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks left-hander Robbie Ray (3-1, 5.23 ERA) and Rockies lefty Kyle Freeland (8-6, 3.18 ERA) will start on Thursday.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  David Freitas' toddler son was mimicking a home run trot outside the Mariners' clubhouse late Wednesday night, waiting to show dad what he had learned.	A few hours earlier, Freitas hit his first major league home run on the way to catching a shutout for Seattle in a 3-0 victory over the Los Angeles Angels.	"If you look at my past career in the minor leagues, maybe six or seven years in the minor leagues to get my first call-up (in 2017), I came a long way since 2010," said Freitas, who reached base three times for the first time in his career. "It was a proud moment for me and especially since I had my mom, my wife and my son all here. They got to share this, too."	Mariners starter Marco Gonzales (10-5) retired his first 10 batters and tossed seven sharp innings. He gave up just two hits and struck out four without issuing a walk.	"It seems like we face him every time we play the Mariners," Angels star Mike Trout said. "He just keeps you off balance. You can't miss a pitch on him. He's at the corners and you just can't miss a pitch."	Alex Colome pitched the eighth and All-Star closer Edwin Diaz worked a perfect ninth for his major league-leading 36th save.	As good as Gonzales was, he really enjoyed talking about Freitas afterward.	"That was really fun to see," the left-hander said. "Those who know him know that he's an absolute phenomenal guy. I'm so happy for him to have some success and he has been great behind the plate."	Freitas, who had been hitless in seven at-bats since being recalled July 5, went deep in the third against starter Jaime Barria. It was Freitas' 32nd career game, 26 with the Mariners.	Barria (5-6) allowed three runs and five hits in five-plus innings with five strikeouts and no walks. The right-hander has lost his last five decisions, including the past two to Seattle.	The Mariners have won 11 of 15 overall. They improved to 27-18 on the road.	Seattle shortstop Jean Segura reached base twice after finding out Wednesday he won the online vote for the final AL All-Star spot. He doubled and was hit by a pitch on the left arm.	Los Angeles did not have a baserunner until the fourth, when Andrelton Simmons hit a comebacker off Gonzales' left leg for a single. Trout followed with a single before Gonzales retired his next 11 batters.	The Angels are 7-17 in games started by an opposing left-handed pitcher, and their 78 runs scored against lefties are the second-fewest in baseball to the San Diego Padres' 73.	"We've looked at everything and historically, we have some guys that are really, really dynamic hitters against left-handed pitching," manager Mike Scioscia said. "They just haven't really gotten into a groove for whatever reason."	After Freitas gave the Mariners a 1-0 lead in the third, Segura doubled leading off the fourth and Mitch Haniger was hit by a pitch. A wild pitch from Barria put both runners in scoring position, and All-Star slugger Nelson Cruz delivered a two-run single for a 3-0 lead.	REMAIN STANDING, PLEASE	As a precaution, Gonzales declined to take a seat between innings after he was hit in the back of the left leg by Simmons' comebacker.	"He was in the batting cage running, trying to keep it loose because once you calm that thing down, it tightens up," Mariners manager Scott Servais said.	His active evening paid dividends. Gonzales not only earned his seventh victory since May 17, he became the 10th pitcher in Mariners history to reach 10 wins before the All-Star break.	"I tried to block it out," Gonzales said, adding he took some pain medication. "I tried to just keep throwing pitches and keep us in the ballgame. But I was thinking about it. It was pretty painful at first."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: C Mike Zunino (bruised left ankle) should be ready to return after the All-Star break, according to Servais. ... RHP Erasmo Ramirez (right lat strain) threw a 25-pitch bullpen at Class A Everett and will advance to 40 pitches before beginning a minor league rehab assignment. ... RHP Dan Altavilla (right elbow flexor strain) has started to play catch but is not yet throwing from a mound.	Angels: RHP Garrett Richards was diagnosed with damage to the ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow and placed on the 10-day disabled list. Richards will decide on surgery or a more conservative rehabilitation process. ... RHP Shohei Ohtani (elbow), already back on the active roster as a designated hitter, will be re-evaluated July 19 in an exam that could determine if he can begin the rehab process to make a return to the mound.	UP NEXT	Mariners LHP James Paxton (8-3, 3.49 ERA) will pitch Thursday on normal rest, moving into the rotation spot left unoccupied when RHP Felix Hernandez (back soreness) went on the 10-day DL. Angels LHP Tyler Skaggs (6-5, 2.64), who had a 0.84 ERA in five June starts, is expected to come off the DL after recovering from a groin strain.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

SAN DIEGO --  Kenta Maeda's work in the winter is paying off for the Dodgers this summer.	Thanks to his newfound changeup, Maeda pitched effectively into the sixth inning and Matt Kemp, Logan Forsythe and Chris Taylor each delivered an RBI single as Los Angeles beat the San Diego Padres 4-2 on Wednesday night.	The surging Dodgers pulled within a half-game of NL West-leading Arizona with their 34th victory in 50 games.	Maeda (6-5) won for the first time since June 25 as the right-hander allowed a run and four hits over 5 2/3 innings. He had nine strikeouts and a walk to help the Dodgers defeat the Padres for the eighth time in 12 meetings this season.	"It's been a game-changer for Kenta and it just keeps the hitters more honest with the change," Los Angeles manager Dave Roberts said. "He can throw that pitch and present it as a strike and the bottom falls out. It's been a huge weapon for him."	It was Maeda's second start since coming off the paternity list and once again he was in control as the Padres had but one hit over his final three-plus innings of work. In his last nine starts, Maeda has a 1.97 ERA with 61 strikeouts in 50 1/3 innings.	"I've been able to use (the changeup) effectively and I've been able to get a lot of punch-outs with it," Maeda said through a translator. "Last year I wasn't able to use it at all. But because of the changeup this year, it's making my other pitches look better today, and maybe my repertoire look even better."	Taylor's single scored Chase Utley, who was aboard on a pinch-hit double, for a 4-2 advantage in the eighth. Kenley Jansen pitched the ninth and overcame a leadoff walk to Wil Myers for his 25th save.	San Diego cut its deficit to one in the seventh when rookie Christian Villanueva hit his 18th homer off reliever Daniel Hudson.	Austin Hedges had two of the Padres' five hits, but San Diego lost for the seventh time in 10 games.	Rookie left-hander Joey Lucchesi (4-5) didn't last past the fourth inning after throwing 91 pitches. He allowed three runs (two earned) and six hits while losing his second straight start.	"I'm not satisfied with myself," Lucchesi said. "I know I could be way better."	Los Angeles jumped ahead in the third as it parlayed four hits and an error into a three-run inning.	Kemp's sharp RBI single brought in Enrique Hernandez after his double. Forsythe, who has struggled all year, produced an RBI infield single, and when shortstop Freddy Galvis short-hopped first baseman Eric Hosmer for a throwing error on Cody Bellinger's grounder, Max Muncy came around.	"I guess I got out of my zone and let the game get away from me," Lucchesi said.	Added manager Andy Green: "As time goes by, he'll be much more pitch-efficient and be able to work deeper into games."	San Diego struck in the first when Carlos Asuaje's double scored Travis Jankowski after he opened with a single. But the Padres seldom threatened after that.	"As the game moved on I felt better and better," Maeda said.	K-9 KENTA	For the fourth consecutive start, Maeda had nine strikeouts. "It seems like nine is the number I keep stopping at," he said. "I was hoping for another one today. I have to work harder."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: LHP Julio Urias (left shoulder) threw to hitters at the team's Arizona facility, reaching 88-92 mph, according to Roberts.	Padres: RHP Jordan Lyles (right elbow) threw a bullpen Sunday and was slated for another one this week.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: RHP Ross Stripling (7-2, 2.22 ERA), added to the NL roster Wednesday for his first All-Star Game, is 2/3 in his career against the Padres. He beat them on May 25 when he allowed just an unearned run over 6 2/3 innings.	Padres: RHP Tyson Ross (5-7, 4.41 ERA) remains a potential trade target with the July 31 deadline approaching. Ross has 10 quality starts this year.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.
