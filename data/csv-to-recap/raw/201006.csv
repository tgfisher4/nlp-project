CINCINNATI -- The last-minute Cincinnati Reds made it look so easy again.	Brandon Phillips' fourth hit, a two-run triple off a nearly perfect reliever Guillermo Mota in the eighth inning, rallied the Reds to yet another late win on Thursday, 7-6 over the San Francisco Giants.	"I don't know if you expect it, but I know everybody believes, from the players to the administrative assistants to the grounds crew," manager Dusty Baker said. "Don't turn off the TV if we've still got bats in our hands."	The Reds lead the majors with 12 wins in their final at-bat. They've got 21 comeback wins -- out of 35 victories overall -- which is also the best around.	"You can't give up on us," said rookie starter Mike Leake, who got the benefit of this turnaround. "We're a pretty good team."	Especially when things look really dire.	Mota (0-2) had allowed only three runs all season. He opened the eighth by giving up a single and a double and then went to a full count before Phillips hit an opposite-field triple, trying it at 6. Joey Votto then singled up the middle -- Mota misjudged the bouncing ball -- for the winning hit.	"I should have gotten that ball," Mota said. "If I get that ball, we're still playing now -- it's a tied game."	Left-hander Arthur Rhodes (2-1) retired five batters, his longest appearance in two years, for the win. Francisco Cordero retired the side in the ninth, getting his 17th save in 21 tries.	Cincinnati opened a 1½-game lead over the idle St. Louis Cardinals in the NL Central, the latest in a season that the Reds have been in first place since June 17, 2002, their final year at Cinergy Field. They finished 78-84 that year under manager Bob Boone.	Cincinnati has a streak of nine straight losing seasons, its longest in more than a half-century.	The Reds' latest comeback settled a wild game of wasted chances and pitching surprises. San Francisco grounded into three double plays with the bases loaded and had another runner caught in a rundown between third and home after a botched squeeze play.	"You can't have tougher luck than we had today," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "They got balls to go through. We hit balls a lot harder and got double plays."	The Giants also lost starter Todd Wellemeyer, who hasn't won on the road since May 27, 2009, with St. Louis. The Giants handed him his best chance yet -- a 4-0 lead in the top of the third inning -- but he hurt himself trying to add to it.	Wellemeyer grounded into a bases-loaded double play in the third, straining to try to beat the relay to first base. He hurt his right thigh and pulled up after crossing the base before leaving the game. He could barely lift his leg afterward, an indication he's likely headed for the disabled list.	"I felt good, too," said Wellemeyer, a Louisville, Ky., native who had 44 friends and relatives in the ballpark. "It's just going to be another hurdle to get over."	Summoned on a moment's notice, Denny Bautista had a tough time getting going, giving up four runs in the bottom of the third. Cincinnati used a pair of walks and two infield hits while batting around.	Even then, Leake was in line for his first big league loss until the majors' last-minute team went at it again.	Leake's 12th big league start was his roughest. The right-hander with the nasty curve gave up a career-high 11 hits and five runs in only 4 1/3 innings. It was the shortest appearance by Leake, whose five wins are tied for most wins by an NL rookie.	"I made more mistakes than I wanted to," said Leake, who went right to the majors from Arizona State. "It reminded me of UCLA. I gave up 11 runs to UCLA once, and they didn't hit the ball hard a lot, either."	Aaron Rowand and Aubrey Huff homered off Leake, but the Giants couldn't take advantage of those three straight bases-loaded chances to put the game away.	Game notes	The Giants begin a six-game homestand against the Oakland Athletics and Baltimore Orioles on Friday. Cincinnati hosts the Kansas City Royals, who swept a three-game interleague series from the Reds last season. ... The Reds gave shortstop Orlando Cabrera a day out of the starting lineup. Phillips took his spot in the order, batting leadoff for the first time since 2007.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

NEW YORK -- Bud Black strolled into the clubhouse and did a mini-dance to the Latin beat, sashaying his hips side to side the best way he knew how.	The manager of the surprising San Diego Padres has plenty of reason to cut a rug these days: Boasting the best ERA in the majors, his impressive pitching staff has been in a smooth groove all season.	Mat Latos outpitched Johan Santana and San Diego stopped New York's nine-game home winning streak by beating the Mets 4-2 on Thursday in the opener of a day-night doubleheader.	"We have a great team," closer Heath Bell said. "You put us individually, we might not be the best guys out there. But you put us together, and we're solid."	Adrian Gonzalez had three hits for the Padres, including a go-ahead single. David Eckstein and Chase Headley added RBI doubles.	Latos and three San Diego relievers combined to retire the final 22 Mets batters after Henry Blanco's two-run homer in the second inning, one of New York's season-low two hits. Jose Reyes opened the game with an infield single.	The lack of run support was nothing new for Santana (4-3), who pitched 15 shutout innings over his previous two starts without getting a decision. This time, he squandered a two-run lead and took the loss.	"There's not much I can do," Santana said. "I just have to pitch my game. I know that sooner or later the offense is going to pick up."	It was New York's fifth defeat in the past 24 games at Citi Field.	Jon Garland was set to pitch for San Diego against left-hander Jonathon Niese in the 7:10 p.m. nightcap, a makeup of Wednesday night's rainout.	"Honestly, before about 10 minutes ago I thought we were about to get going again," Padres reliever Luke Gregerson said. "I didn't know we were going to have to wait three hours."	The 22-year-old Latos (6-4) allowed only two hits in six innings and struck out eight. The right-hander set down his last 13 batters, improving to 5-1 with a 1.96 ERA and 47 strikeouts in his last seven starts.	"He's got great stuff. He's got just as good stuff as anybody in the league," Gonzalez said. "When you execute your pitches with that kind of stuff you're going to have success."	Then, the Padres turned to their dominant bullpen. Gregerson fanned all three batters in the seventh, Mike Adams worked a perfect eighth and Bell, an ex-Met, pitched the ninth for his 17th save in 20 chances.	"When the season started nobody knew who they were, but they are really doing the job," New York infielder Alex Cora said.	Pitching on seven days' rest after tossing seven scoreless innings June 2 at San Diego, Santana looked rusty. He walked No. 8 batter Tony Gwynn Jr. to start the fifth and, after Latos struck out trying to bunt, Eckstein lined an RBI double to left that tied it at 2.	One out later, Gonzalez came up with first base open -- but the Mets made a curious decision and pitched to him anyway. The slugger hit a humpback liner over second for a run-scoring single that put the Padres ahead 3-2.	"I didn't think he had hit me hard and I was just trying to make a pitch," Santana said. "I thought I could get him out."	Santana induced his third double-play grounder in the seventh but couldn't get through the inning. Eckstein walked and scored from first when Headley doubled to deep right, chasing the two-time Cy Young Award winner.	"It is weird. I didn't have command of my fastball at all. It was a battle all day to keep the ball down," Santana said.	In the second, Blanco homered into the front row of left-field seats on the 10th pitch of his first at-bat in eight days. The backup catcher has been bothered by a sore neck.	San Diego loaded the bases with none out in the fourth on Gonzalez's leadoff single and consecutive walks. Jerry Hairston Jr. hit a sacrifice fly, ending Santana's scoreless streak at 18 2/3 innings.	The left-hander escaped further damage when David Wright started a nifty double play on Chris Denorfia's sharp grounder to third.	Game notes	 Gonzalez is batting .459 with four homers and 12 RBIs in his past nine games. ... Jesus Feliciano struck out as a pinch-hitter in the eighth for New York, his major league debut after 13 years in the minors.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CHICAGO -- At long last, the Chicago White Sox are getting the starting pitching they expected. And they're getting much more than they anticipated from ageless Omar Vizquel.	The 43-year-old Vizquel homered for the first time in nearly a year and also had a suicide-squeeze bunt in support of John Danks, who pitched seven innings of one-hit ball as Chicago beat the Detroit Tigers 3-0 on Thursday.	The White Sox thought they'd have one of baseball's best rotations: Jake Peavy, Mark Buehrle, Gavin Floyd, Freddy Garcia and Danks. But their starters went into this week's series against Detroit with an AL-worst 5.28 ERA.	Floyd, Garcia and Danks then combined to allow only four runs to Detroit, and the White Sox won the last two games of the series -- only their fourth winning streak of any kind all season.	Chicago is 26-33, four games behind the second-place Tigers and well back of AL Central-leading Minnesota.	"We're better than what we've done," said Danks, who was 1-5 with a 5.05 ERA in his previous seven starts. "We know we can get outs, get deep in games and give us a chance to win every time out. This might be the run that gets us on a roll."	During an expletive-filled postgame rant after the Tigers got held to three hits, manager Jim Leyland said White Sox starters couldn't have gotten on a roll without significant help from Detroit's flailing batters.	Ticking off the names of Floyd, Garcia and Danks, Leyland said, "You've got to hit somebody."	"They're good pitchers, don't misunderstand me. But three straight days, inning after inning, day after day," he said. "I'm not upset with anybody, I'm just stating fact."	The Tigers were 24-17 and tied for first place on May 20 but are 6-12 since.	Max Scherzer (2-6) pitched well for the Tigers -- three runs on five hits in 7 1/3 innings -- but allowed homers to Vizquel and A.J. Pierzynski and earned his manager's ire by failing to execute a pitchout on Vizquel's sixth-inning squeeze.	"Cost him a run," Leyland said. "You can't make those mistakes."	Vizquel's first home run since last Aug. 7 also was his 2,724th hit, tying Roberto Alomar for 54th on the career list.	One of the best shortstops ever, Vizquel had been a seldom-used utility infielder this season until third baseman Mark Teahen broke his finger two weeks ago. Vizquel was batting .196 on May 29 but is hitting .344 with eight RBIs in nine games since Teahen's injury.	"It's hard to come off the bench and play once or twice a week, hard to maintain your timing at the plate," Vizquel said. "I believe if I get more playing time, I can still be the player I was."	Like the rest of the team -- including GM Ken Williams, who on Wednesday threatened to make significant changes -- Vizquel is surprised by Chicago's poor start.	"I never thought this team was going to be in this situation," he said. "It's about time things get turned around."	Danks (5-5) walked four and struck out four. Carlos Guillen's second-inning single was the only hit he allowed.	He was helped by the absence of Tigers slugger Magglio Ordonez, who is batting .609 in 23 at-bats against the left-hander. Ordonez, who has a .336 career average against the White Sox, missed the three-game series with a sore left side.	Sergio Santos relieved to start the eighth with a 2-0 lead and gave up Gerald Laird's single before walking Austin Jackson and Johnny Damon with one out. Ryan Raburn, Ordonez's replacement, hit a foul pop and Miguel Cabrera struck out chasing a low, 3-2 changeup.	Cabrera entered the game batting .343 with 53 RBIs and 18 homers -- including 10 in his last 16 games. Pierzynski, Chicago's catcher, went to the mound before the 3-2 pitch.	"He said, 'Believe in your stuff. It's good enough to get this guy out,'" Santos said. "I had thrown [Cabrera] four straight fastballs, so I just figured if I could make any kind of pitch resembling a fastball he would be swinging -- and luckily he did."	Pierzynski homered on Scherzer's first pitch of the eighth.	Bobby Jenks worked the ninth inning for his 10th save.	Game notes	 The White Sox open a three-game series Friday against the Cubs at Wrigley Field. Peavy, who wanted to be traded to the Cubs before agreeing to come to the White Sox last year, starts the opener. ... Detroit fell to 13-14 in AL Central games, meaning only the Twins have a winning record within the division. ... Gordon Beckham doubled and eventually scored on Vizquel's squeeze. It was the second straight game with a double after going 112 consecutive at-bats without an extra-base hit.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

MILWAUKEE -- When a player has the speed of Milwaukee's Carlos Gomez, just about anything is possible. Even a walk-off bunt.	Gomez raced all the way from first to third on Craig Counsell's sacrifice, then kept heading home on a wild throw to give the Milwaukee Brewers a 5-4 victory over the Chicago Cubs in 10 innings Thursday.	The unorthodox win wasn't anything new to Counsell, who said he has seen it happen before.	"I saw it in the movie 'Major League,'" Counsell joked.	The Brewers took two out of three games from their NL Central rivals, a tough finish to a trying road trip for the Cubs.	After 10 games on the road, including a pair of trips to Pittsburgh because of a rainout, the Cubs now return to Wrigley Field to face the White Sox in a three-game series beginning Friday.	"We won one game in each town," Cubs manager Lou Piniella said. "We hope to do better."	Milwaukee's Corey Hart hit his NL-leading 16th homer in the second inning -- ignoring the roar of the Navy Blue Angels, who are in the area for a weekend air show and were flying over Miller Park.	Hart admitted he was distracted by the noise on a pitch just before he homered. "It's entertaining watching them go over -- when you weren't hitting," he said.	Xavier Nady, filling in on a day off for Derrek Lee, hit a two-run homer.	John Axford (3-1) pitched the 10th for the win.	Gomez pinch-hit and drew a leadoff walk from Bob Howry (1-1). Counsell followed with the bunt and the speedy Gomez rounded second base and just kept going as Nady caught the ball at first base.	"I said, 'Why not?'" Gomez said. "I took my chance and (went) to third."	Nady's frantic throw to third sailed wild, allowing Gomez to score.	"It was great baserunning," Counsell said. "He had the green light, he went, and he had in his head before he got to second he was going to keep going. He never slowed down. Even if they make a good throw, he's still safe."	In hindsight, Nady said he should have held the ball.	"Tried to just react and throw, but obviously it didn't turn out like it was supposed to," Nady said.	The walk to Gomez proved costly, one of nine walks issued by Cubs pitchers.	Cubs starter Ryan Dempster turned in his shortest outing of the season, allowing three runs and walking five in 5 1/3 innings. He came into Thursday's game with 13 career wins over the Brewers, including four straight.	"I just walked too many guys, especially with nobody out," Dempster said. "Every time I do that I put us in a position that we had to try make every play."	Brewers starter Dave Bush went six innings, giving up four runs and six hits. He added an RBI single in the fourth.	With the Cubs leading 4-3 and two outs in the sixth, rookie shortstop Starlin Castro made a costly throwing error on Jim Edmonds' fairly routine ground ball. Reliever Tom Gorzelanny walked Rickie Weeks and Prince Fielder, and manager Lou Piniella brought in Jeff Stevens to face Ryan Braun.	Braun, who was 0 for 10 in the series to that point, briefly called time as the Blue Angels jets once again roared overhead. Stevens then walked him, scoring a run and tying it at 4.	Was it the Cubs' sloppiest game of the year?	"It wasn't good," Piniella said. "It wasn't good."	Marlon Byrd, who was 3 for 4, said the errors are a byproduct of aggressive play.	"We're doing everything we can," Byrd said, "but it can't be like this all year."	Game notes	 Cubs radio announcer Ron Santo felt ill before the game and went home instead of calling Thursday's game, according to a team spokesman. ... Castro has made eight errors in 31 games this season. ... Edmonds made a surprising appearance as the Brewers' leadoff hitter.

Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

DENVER -- The Houston Astros are still surging, thanks to Roy Oswalt's continued mastery of the Colorado Rockies.	Oswalt struck out nine, Humberto Quintero homered and the Astros beat Colorado 5-4 Thursday for their third straight victory.	Quintero got three hits and Tommy Manzella drove in a career-high three runs as the Astros won for the ninth time in 12 games.	Oswalt (4-8) is 8-2 in his career against the Rockies, including a one-hitter in Coors Field on Sept. 6, 2008.	"I remember I should have had the no-hitter," Oswalt said. "I should have caught the ball hit by Brad Hawpe."	Oswalt wasn't as dominant this time, but he was sharp enough to keep the Rockies tumbling. He gave up four hits over seven innings and left with a 5-2 lead.	"My ball was moving around that night just like today," Oswalt said. "I was making pitches where I wanted them to be and my four-seam fastball was cutting that night, too."	Todd Helton and Troy Tulowitzki had two hits each for the Rockies, who have lost six of eight.	"We still have confidence," outfielder Carlos Gonzalez said. "We know we're a good team, we just need to prove it."	Quintero led off the fifth with his third home run to give Houston a 3-2 lead.	The Astros added two runs in the sixth. Carlos Lee and Hunter Pence walked with one out, Quintero singled to short to load the bases and Manzella looped a two-run single over second to make it 5-2.	"He got sloppy in the fifth inning and he got sloppy in the sixth inning and it ended up leading to three more runs," Rockies manager Jim Tracy said of starter Jhoulys Chacin.	The Astros took advantage of Chacin's mistakes, something they've done in their recent winning stretch.	"When Carlos and Lance [Berkman] aren't hitting, people like Q and Manzella are coming through," Houston manager Brad Mills said. "Everybody is pitching in and doing a little bit here and there. And the starters and bullpen are doing better."	Five runs was all the support Oswalt needed. The right-hander struck out the side in the first and was in control except for Colorado's two-run fourth. He allowed two runs and four hits and walked two in seven innings.	With Oswalt out of the game, the Rockies rallied in the eighth. Gonzalez, Helton and Tulowitzki led off with singles against reliever Wilton Lopez to make it 5-3. Gustavo Chacin came on and struck out Hawpe before giving up a single to Ryan Spilborghs to load the bases.	Casey Daigle relieved Chacin, and after a fielder's choice scored Helton to make it 5-4, he got pinch-hitter Jason Giambi to fly out to end the threat.	"We had pitches to do some damage with to come back and steal this game and we didn't get it done," Tracy said	Brandon Lyon worked the ninth for his first save.	The Astros jumped ahead in the second inning on Chacin (3-5). With one out, Pence walked and Pedro Feliz reached on third baseman Ian Stewart's throwing error. Quintero's double down the left-field line scored Pence and Feliz came home on Manzella's sacrifice fly to make it 2-0.	Chacin allowed five runs, four earned, and four hits. He struck out eight and walked three in six innings.	The Rockies tied it in the fourth when Helton led off with a single and went to third on Tulowitzki's single, who advanced to second on the throw. Hawpe's ground out to second scored Helton and Tulowitzki scored on Seth Smith's shallow fly to center to make it 2-all.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- Manager Bob Geren walked to the mound after Trevor Cahill issued his first walk of the game with one out in the eighth inning, making sure his starter still had enough left in the tank.	Cahill persuaded Geren to keep him in the game to the delight of the Oakland crowd and capped another strong start by retiring the final two batters of the inning.	Cahill allowed one run in a career-high eight innings to win his fourth straight start and the Athletics beat nemesis Ervin Santana and the Los Angeles Angels 6-1 Thursday.	"I just wanted to make sure he was OK," Geren said. "I wanted to see the look on his face and the reaction to the questions I asked him. I knew pitch count wise he was fine. The weather was just right. I felt like he was OK."	Cahill (5-2) was more than that, allowing only an RBI single from Bobby Wilson in the fifth while extending his run of strong starts. Cahill gave up six hits and one walk, lowering his ERA to 1.33 in his past four starts.	He got a standing ovation from the crowd of 12,328 when he finished, topping the 7 1/3 innings he pitched last year against Arizona.	"It was pretty cool," he said. "We don't have the biggest crowds so when they're into the games like that it shows they're paying attention. It was pretty special."	Ryan Sweeney scored three times and Daric Barton drove in one run and scored two for the A's, who earned a split of the four-game series against their AL West rivals.	Andrew Bailey finished with a perfect ninth, sending the A's into an interleague series in San Francisco against the cross-bay rival Giants on a high note.	The A's struck for two runs in the fourth and three in the fifth against Santana (6-4), who came into the game with an 11-2 record and a 1.50 ERA in 19 career appearances against Oakland. His ERA was the lowest any pitcher with at least 10 starts had against the A's and he had never given up more than three runs in a single start.	"I made a couple mistakes but that doesn't really matter because I have to refocus and just pitch," Santana said. "That's going to happen a lot. Nobody's perfect."	The Angels finish their 14-game road trip with a three-game series in Los Angeles against the Dodgers. They are 8-3 so far on the trip.	Santana, who had won five straight starts, retired the first eight batters he faced and appeared to be in control once again until issuing a leadoff walk to Barton to open the fourth inning. Sweeney followed with an RBI double that right fielder Juan Rivera appeared to misplay and Gabe Gross drove in another run with a swinging bunt single with two outs.	"Guys were just getting good pitches to hit up in the zone and taking advantage of it," Sweeney said. "We didn't try to do too much. We scored quite a few runs off him today which was good."	The A's added three more runs in the fifth on RBI singles by Barton, Kurt Suzuki and Kevin Kouzmanoff to make it 5-1. Cliff Pennington scored the first run after his second single in the game. Pennington had been mired in a 3-for-46 slump before coming through against Santana.	Santana allowed five runs -- four earned -- and seven hits in five innings -- his shortest start of the season.	"Ervin wasn't that far off. Those guys did a good job when they got some guys in scoring position," manager Mike Scioscia said. "I certainly don't think he pitched as poorly as maybe his linescore is going to show."	Game notes	 The A's improved to a major league best 16-7 in day games. ... The Angels had been 7-0 when Wilson started at catcher. ... Suzuki will miss the three-game series against the Giants because of a death in the family. The A's will call up a catcher to replace him while he is on bereavement leave. ... Geren will miss the opener Friday to attend his son's high school graduation. ... Oakland DH Eric Chavez (neck spasms) will begin a rehab assignment at Triple-A Sacramento on Monday. ... A's OF Rajai Davis (left hamstring) ran before the game and is expected to return this weekend in San Francisco, Geren said.

PHOENIX -- Bobby Cox said a long goodbye to Arizona's Chase Field. For almost four hours, he watched his Braves build a big lead, blow it, then break it open again for an 11-7 victory on Thursday.	"That was a hard game to enjoy, it really was," said the longtime manager who will retire at the end of the season. "It would never end. ... That would have been a tough one to swallow if we lost."	After the Braves blew a five-run lead, Brooks Conrad scrambled home to break a ninth-inning tie, banging into catcher John Hester while diving headfirst across the plate.	"He was kind of blocking the plate," Conrad said. "A situation like that you've got to do anything you can to score that run. So my thought process was if the ball beat me, I'd try to do something to jar it loose. He got the ball right in the web and I pretty much got there at the same time. There was enough of the plate to kind of get around him."	The speedy Conrad hit for David Ross, who had a double, single and two RBIs. Conrad singled, stole second and beat right fielder Justin Upton's throw after pinch-hitter Brian McCann's one-out single off closer Chad Qualls (1-3).	"For only playing one inning, he got dirty," Cox said.	Jason Heyward and Eric Hinske also had RBI singles off Qualls. A sacrifice fly by Troy Glaus off Carlos Rosa capped the late burst.	Atlanta matched its season high with 16 hits yet still left 12 on base for a total of 47. The Diamondbacks struck out 16 times, a season high for them and for Braves pitchers. Arizona batters have struck out 570 times in 61 games, by far the most in the majors.	"We're long past it being a concern,. The more we talk about it, the more it happens, I think," said Arizona manager A.J. Hinch, who added a big understatement. "Probably lineup-wise we strike out a significantly amount more than we should."	Reliever Jonny Venters' throwing error on what should have been an inning-ending double play set up a three-run double by ex-Brave Kelly Johnson in the eighth that tied it at 7.	Peter Moylan (3-1) got the final out of the eighth for the win. He was on the mound when outfielders Nate McLouth and Heyward collided on a game-winning inside-the-park home run by Gerardo Parra in Wednesday night's 2-1 loss.	Arizona loaded the bases in the ninth against Billy Wagner, but Rusty Ryal and pinch hitter Chris Snyder struck out to end it.	Atlanta leadoff batter Martin Prado reached five times on three hits and two walks.	Tommy Hanson, looking for his fourth straight win, had a 7-2 lead when he left after 5 1/3 innings.	"He didn't get any breaks," Cox said.	Asked if Hanson throwing a season-high 121 pitches had anything to do with umpire Angel Hernandez's challenging strike zone, Cox said, "It was rough. That's all I've got to say."	Hanson's two-run single had been the highlight of a five-run Atlanta fifth inning. All five runs were charged to reliever Cesar Chavez in just two-thirds of an inning after erratic Dontrelle Willis was lifted with the game tied 2-2 through four.	Chris Young led off the Arizona seventh with his 10th home run, then Johnson singled and later scored on Stephen Drew's groundout to cut the lead to 7-4.	In the eighth, Venters walked Mark Reynolds with one out to bring up Ryal, who bounced to the pitcher for what looked to be an inning-ending double play. Venters, though, threw the ball into center field and both runners were safe. He regrouped to strike out Adam LaRoche, but walked Young to load the bases.	The lefty stayed in to face the left-handed hitting Johnson, who lashed an offspeed pitch just inside the right field line to clear the bases.	Willis, who was bothered by a torn fingernail, gave up two runs and three hits, throwing 95 pitches in four innings.	Game notes	 McLouth had the day off after his collision with Heyward on Wednesday night. McLouth's head slammed to the ground on the play. ... Willis had 3-0 counts on the first three batters and four of the first five. He walked three of them. .... The Braves are 4-4 on their longest trip of the season, which ends with three at Minnesota.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

BALTIMORE -- In his major league debut, Jake Arrieta didn't draw a sellout crowd, strike out 14 batters or hit 100 mph on the radar gun.	Nah, all he did was beat the defending World Series champion New York Yankees.	Arrieta pitched six innings of four-hit ball, and the Baltimore Orioles ended their 10-game losing streak against the Yankees with a 4-3 victory Thursday night.	Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez left the game after the first inning. The premature exit occurred four days after he was pulled from a game against Toronto with groin tightness.	"The last two days it has felt the exact same way and once it got warm it was OK. Today, it cramped up right before batting practice," Rodriguez said.	He knew things were wrong when he couldn't move to his left to get an RBI single by Adam Jones in the first inning.	"Not only do I usually make that play, but it is a routine play," he said. "I just locked up."	A-Rod intends to see the team doctor Friday, but said, "I hope I play."	Manager Joe Girardi said, "Hopefully, it's just a day-to-day thing. We might need to give him a couple days off. We'll know more after he's seen the doctor."	Although Arrieta's arrival didn't get a fraction of the attention that Stephen Strasburg received in Washington on Tuesday, there was still a buzz at Camden Yards -- and more fans in attendance (27,064) than in each of the previous two games of the series.	Drafted in the fifth round of the 2007 amateur draft, the 24-year-old Arrieta provided a glimmer of hope for a struggling franchise that owns the worst record in the majors (17-43). The right-hander wasn't particularly overpowering, but he mixed his 106 pitches well enough to keep the best-hitting team in the majors in check.	"It's real satisfying to go out there and throw well enough in my debut to get a win against these guys," Arrieta said. "It feels good. I really just wanted to go out there and make pitches and not let the adrenaline get the best of me."	Arrieta gave up three runs and outpitched veteran A.J. Burnett (6-4), who came in 11-2 lifetime against the Orioles and 5-0 in Baltimore.	Arrieta never got to face A-Rod, but he launched his first major league start against Derek Jeter -- an assignment he did not take lightly.	"I was talking to my wife and a couple of my friends and I was telling them it was going to be pretty exciting (that) the first hitter I face is Jeter," Arrieta said. "That's pretty special to me. I know that's something I will remember for a long time. To be able to tell my friends and family and my kids."	Jeter grounded out, although he later doubled and walked against the rookie.	Arrieta (1-0) struck out six, walked four (two intentionally) and limited New York to 1-for-5 batting with runners in scoring position.	He started and finished his outing with two impressive innings. Arrieta worked a perfect first, and after a double and two intentional walks loaded the bases with two outs in the sixth, he struck out Marcus Thames.	"I know there's going to be a lot of times like that throughout my career where I'm going to have to make those type of pitches, and to be able to do it tonight in my debut was very important to me," Arrieta said.	David Hernandez, the last of three relievers, worked the ninth for his first big league save and Baltimore's first since May 21.	Scott Moore homered and Jones had two RBIs for the Orioles, who improved to 2-10 against the Yankees this season.	Baltimore snapped a 3-3 tie in the sixth when Luke Scott tripled and scored on a double by Jones.	Burnett gave up four runs and eight hits in 6 2/3 innings. He was 2-0 with a 0.00 ERA against Baltimore this season.	After Arrieta sandwiched two groundouts around a foul popup in the top of the first, Burnett appeared to be the one making his big league debut in the bottom half. He hit two batters, gave up two hits and yielded two runs.	New York closed to 2-1 in the second when Robinson Cano hit a one-out double and scored on a triple by Curtis Granderson.	A walk to No. 9 hitter Chad Moeller, an RBI double by Jeter and a sacrifice fly by Nick Swisher put the Yankees ahead in the third.	Burnett retired 10 straight batters before Moore led off the fifth with his first homer since April 2008.	Game notes	 Baltimore improved to 2-4 under interim manager Juan Samuel. ... Jeter has reached via a hit, walk or HBP in 28 straight games, tied with Tampa Bay's Evan Longoria for longest such streak in the majors this year. Longoria's streak is also active. ... Cano went 1 for 3, ending his run of three straight 3-hit games. ... New York is 32-3 when allowing four runs or less.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CLEVELAND -- Maybe veteran Russell Branyan and the young Cleveland Indians can salvage this season after all.	Branyan hit a two-out, two-run single in the ninth inning Thursday night, rallying the Indians to a crazy 8-7 win over the Boston Red Sox.	"I hit it and just held my breath until it hit the ground," Branyan said.	Cleveland overcame three errors in one inning by third baseman Andy Marte, a 5-0 deficit, then a blown save by Kerry Wood along with an eighth-inning disruption by two unruly fans.	"That's about as roller coaster as you can get," Red Sox manager Terry Francona said.	Adrian Beltre's two-out, two-run homer in the ninth off Wood (1-2) put Boston ahead 7-6.	The Indians quickly loaded the bases with no outs against Daniel Bard (1-2) in the bottom half. Bard, closing while Jonathan Papelbon is on the bereavement list, then struck out Travis Hafner and retired Jhonny Peralta on a foulout.	Branyan then delivered a looping single over second baseman Dustin Pedroia in shallow right field.	"I was praying for it (to be caught)," Bard said. "It was in no man's land.	"There wasn't a point in that inning when I thought I wouldn't get out of it. I think you have to have that mentality."	A different mental state arose in the eighth. Two young men, one wearing a LeBron James jersey, sprinted across the outfield. One waved a bag of resin, creating a stream that resembled smoke. James' pregame ritual at Cleveland Cavaliers games is loading his hands with powder and tossing it in the air.	One of the men slid to the ground as security personnel pursued him. The other tried to jump over a wall but was shoved back by fans onto the field. Both men were handcuffed, hustled into the Indians bullpen and taken from Progressive Field.	"I was warming up in the bullpen," Wood said. "It was weird."	Earlier this season, a fan ran on the field in Philadelphia and was stopped with a Taser.	Wood got two fast outs in the ninth before hitting J.D. Drew in the right leg with a pitch. Beltre then hit his eighth homer to put Boston ahead.	Beltre is 5 for 14 (.358) with three homers and seven RBIs in his career against Wood, who blew his second save in six tries.	"I threw four bad pitches in a row," Wood said. "I hit a guy, went to 2-and-0, then he hit the next one out. I'm still kicking myself for hitting Drew."	The Indians loaded the bases against Bard on walks to Trevor Crowe and Austin Kearns around an opposite-field double by Shin-Soo Choo. Two outs later, Branyan won it.	"I hit it right into the teeth of the shift," Branyan joked.	"Two outs, game on the line, I don't think it gets any more nerve-racking than that. You make an out and the game's over. You've got a guy out there throwing a 100 miles an hour. You try to pick out a pitch you can get some wood on."	One night after handing the Red Sox an 11-0 loss, their worst of the season, the Indians finally gained a second consecutive home victory for the first time since winning four in a row April 15-18 at Progressive Field. Cleveland has only 23 wins -- but 14 have been comeback victories.	Lou Marson's two-run single in the sixth put Cleveland ahead 6-5 against Boston starter Jon Lester.	Marte helped atone for his miscues with an RBI single to bring the Indians within 5-4 in the sixth. Marson followed with a slicing opposite-field bloop to score two more.	Marte become the first major leaguer with three errors in an inning since Chicago White Sox third baseman Andy Gonzalez on Aug. 30, 2007. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, the last Indians player to commit three errors in an inning was shortstop Frank Duffy on Sept. 24, 1972 -- in the 11th inning of the first game of a doubleheader against the New York Yankees.	Marte bobbled a ground ball by Kevin Youkilis with the bases loaded, scoring one run. Later, he made two errors on one play as two runs scored when he mishandled a grounder hit by Mike Cameron, scrambled after it and threw wildly to first.	"It was the worst inning of my career," Marte said. "I felt so bad, but now I feel so good -- because my teammates picked me up. What a win!"	Lester gave up six runs and nine hits over six innings. He struck out eight with one walk after going 7-0 with a 1.29 ERA in nine previous starts since a loss to Tampa Bay on April 18.	Game notes	 Boston DH David Ortiz was 0 for 4 and is 3 for 33 (.084) in June. ... Youkilis left with a mild back spasm in the seventh. He was 0 for 3 after getting 11 RBIs in nine games, going 15 for 35 (.429). ... Francona said Papelbon will be activated Friday. ... Red Sox RHP Daisuke Matsuzaka threw a bullpen session. He was sent to the team hotel Wednesday with stomach flu. ... Cleveland's Jason Donald played second base for the first time in the majors. A career shortstop, he started making the switch at Triple-A Columbus before being called up May 18 when SS Asdrubal Cabrera sustained a broken left arm. ... Red Sox 2B Dustin Pedroia was 2 for 5, snapping an 0-for-15 slump.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PHILADELPHIA -- Josh Johnson knew he didn't have to be perfect to beat Roy Halladay.	Just plenty good.	The Marlins ace outdueled Halladay in their perfect game rematch, pitching eight dominant innings and leading Florida over the Philadelphia Phillies 2-0 Thursday night.	The two last met on May 29 in Miami, when the Phillies ace threw the 20th perfect game in major league history in a 1-0 win.	This time, Johnson (7-2) gave up three hits, walked one and struck out five as the Marlins ended a four-game losing streak.	"I wasn't trying to match up with him pitch-for-pitch," Johnson said. "I just wanted to pitch my game and see what happens. I was ready to go tonight."	Halladay (8-4) was brilliant, too, allowing one run and six hits in eight innings. He fanned eight and walked one. His bid at perfection ended quickly when Chris Coghlan singled to start the game.	"When Coghlan got the hit, the whole dugout cheered," Johnson said.	Gaby Sanchez followed Coghlan with a single and Hanley Ramirez walked to load the bases with no outs, setting up Jorge Cantu's sacrifice fly. Halladay turned off the faucet, striking out Dan Uggla and retiring Cody Ross on a grounder.	"It's tough coming in when you know what you obviously know what you're in for," Halladay said. "You try to limit it as much as possible. He's one of the pitchers right now. He's been on a roll, so that makes it tough. I'm not concerned. There are a lot of players in here that know how to win. Nothing worthwhile is every easy."	Halladay and Johnson each lowered their ERAs to under 2.00.	Uggla hit his 14th home run of the season off Danys Baez in the eighth.	Johnson escaped a first-inning jam by striking out Jayson Werth, then retired 17 in a row after allowing a one-out double to Shane Victorino in the third. Johnson was pulled after 113 pitches. He has surrendered one runs or no runs in he previous six starts.	Leo Nunez worked around a one-out double to Placido Polanco for his 13th save in 15 chances. He struck out Ryan Howard to end it, finishing a game played in a brisk two hours, 23 minutes.	"I saw a couple of empty seats in right field," said Marlins manager Fredi Gonzalez. "They missed a hell of a game. J.J. had command of his fastball and had a good sinker. He was outstanding. Halladay minimized the damage in the first inning and J.J. matched him. That's what you have to do to beat Doc."	A game after scoring 10 runs, the Phillies were shut out for the seventh time this season, matching their entire total from 2009. Though their offense has stalled over the past few weeks, few teams can solve Johnson.	"When you don't score, you're not going to win the game," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said. "Johnson is one of the better pitchers in our league. We didn't hit many balls hard. Outside of Raul Ibanez [who singled in the second], I'm trying to think of another ball we hit hard. We couldn't get to him."	As for getting blanked seven times already, Manuel said, "I never thought about getting shut out that many times."	Said Howard: "It was two great pitchers tonight, so we knew base hits were going to be tough to come by."	Game notes	 The Phillies announced that Wednesday night's rainout against Florida will be made up as part of a day-night doubleheader on Sept. 6. The first game is scheduled for 1:05 p.m., followed by the regularly scheduled 7:05 start. ... Coghlan, the 2009 NL Rookie of the Year, extended his hitting streak to 10 games. ... Marlins OF Mike Stanton, who got three hits in his major league debut Tuesday, went 0 for 4 with two strikeouts.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- The Toronto Blue Jays needed a strong start from Brett Cecil, and the left-hander delivered.	Cecil won his fifth consecutive start, Alex Gonzalez homered and drove in two runs and the Blue Jays beat the Tampa Bay Rays 3-2 on Thursday night.	"Cecil pitched a great ballgame for us," Toronto manager Cito Gaston said. "We needed a win."	Cecil (7-2) allowed one run and three hits over 6 2/3 innings. He has given up six earned runs in 36 1/3 innings over that stretch.	"I didn't think I had my best stuff, so you had to battle with location," Cecil said. "Location-wise it wasn't there. It's a meaningful win for me to battle like that."	Cecil is the first Toronto left-hander since Gustavo Chacin (Oct. 2, 2005, to April 25, 2006) to win five straight starts.	The Blue Jays had been outscored 19-1 in losing the first two games of the three-game series.	"It's a great win for us after the first two games," Cecil said.	Carlos Pena hit his 129th homer with Tampa Bay, which set a franchise record. The Rays have won six of nine against Toronto this season.	"I'm extremely grateful to have an opportunity to do something like this," Pena said. "A very special day for me. It would have been a lot better if we would have gotten that win."	Tampa Bay All-Star left fielder Carl Crawford was out of the starting lineup for the second time in the past three games for what Rays manager Joe Maddon called "preventative maintenance." Crawford did pinch-run and steal second in the ninth.	"There's nothing wrong," Maddon said. "We just want to get him off his feet, especially on the [artificial] turf. He's always had trouble with this particular field."	Maddon said Crawford will play in all three games of an interleague series with Florida that starts on Friday.	Kevin Gregg, who allowed a leadoff homer to Sean Rodriguez, pitched the ninth to record his 15th save. He struck out Hank Blalock with two on and two out.	"He got the job done. It wasn't easy," Gaston said. "It's never too easy beating that club over there."	Rays right-hander Wade Davis (5-6) gave up three runs and seven hits in seven-plus innings.	Gonzalez put the Blue Jays up 1-0 on a second-inning homer. The Blue Jays, who lead the majors with 98 homers, had not gone deep in the previous 20 innings.	Pena tied it at 1 in the bottom of the second on his fifth homer over the past four games.	"We gave ourselves a great shot," Pena said. "We're going to lose some games. It's good to see even when we come up short, at the same time we give ourselves a good opportunity to come out victorious at the end."	Toronto went up 2-1 in the third on Adam Lind's RBI single. Gonzalez added an eighth-inning sacrifice fly.	Game notes	 Tampa Bay signed Georgia Tech shortstop Derek Dietrich, taken in the second round of this year's amateur draft. ... Gaston spoke highly of Tampa Bay's rotation, saying the Rays "probably have the best five starters in baseball." ... Rays catcher Dioner Navarro didn't play due to a stiff neck. ... Toronto placed infielder John McDonald on the bereavement list and purchased the contract of minor league outfielder Dewayne Wise. ... Tampa Bay shortstop Jason Bartlett, on the 15-day DL with a strained right hamstring, remains on track to return next week. ... It was the Rays' 1,000th regular-season home game. Tampa Bay is 490-510.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

NEW YORK -- On a day filled with impressive pitching performances, Jonathon Niese delivered the best of the bunch.	Niese tossed a one-hitter for his first career complete game and the New York Mets overcame a triple play to beat the San Diego Padres 3-0 on Thursday night for a doubleheader split.	Niese allowed only Chris Denorfia's leadoff double in the third inning, his second stellar start since coming off the disabled list Saturday. He faced 28 batters, one more than the minimum, in New York's first complete game this season.	"He had no-hit stuff," catcher Rod Barajas said. "When a guy has that kind of control and command, that's a night when something special happens."	Mat Latos outpitched Johan Santana in the opener, and San Diego stopped New York's nine-game home winning streak with a 4-2 victory.	Adrian Gonzalez had three hits for the Padres, including a go-ahead single. David Eckstein and Chase Headley added RBI doubles.	"We play a lot of these kind of games," Gonzalez said. "We had four good pitchers on the mound today, so it's going to equal a little amount of runs."	Latos and three relievers combined to retire the final 22 Mets after Henry Blanco's two-run homer in the second inning, one of New York's season-low two hits. Jose Reyes opened the game with an infield single.	Niese (3-2) topped that, however, striking out six and walking none in his fifth career win. He retired his last 21 batters and threw 76 of 108 pitches for strikes in a game that took only 2 hours, 18 minutes.	"Ever since I came off the DL, I haven't felt anything," said Niese, sidelined from May 17 to June 4 with a strained right hamstring. "Before that, I felt some lingering soreness. When I went on the DL, I got some rest and it's paid off."	The previous Mets pitcher to throw a complete-game, one-hitter that lasted the full nine innings was Aaron Heilman on April 15, 2005, against Florida. New York has never had a no-hitter in its 49-season history.	Niese received a warm ovation when he came out for the ninth. Moments later, the 23-year-old lefty took a cream pie in the face from teammate Angel Pagan during a postgame interview.	"Anytime you have an outing such as this when you're really dominant, that gives you another level of confidence," Mets manager Jerry Manuel said. "He's commanding all his pitches and is a very confident young man."	Chris Carter hit a leadoff double in the second off Jon Garland (6-4) and scored on Jeff Francoeur's bloop single.	With runners on first and second, rookie Ruben Tejada hit a one-hopper at Headley. He stepped on third and threw to second baseman Lance Zawadzki, whose relay beat Tejada by at least a step.	"It was kind of strange because I was actually thinking about it before it happened," Headley said. "Definitely the most routine one I've ever seen."	It was the eighth triple play in Padres history and first since May 19, 1997, when pitcher Andy Ashby, shortstop Chris Gomez and first baseman Archi Cianfrocco did it against Cincinnati's Ed Taubensee.	"It was nice, but at the end of the day it really wasn't worth anything," Gonzalez said.	Niese drew a leadoff walk in the third and went to third base when catcher Yorvit Torrealba threw wildly past first for an error on Reyes' bunt single. David Wright had a run-scoring groundout and Ike Davis followed with a two-out RBI single.	The Mets took two of three from surprising San Diego for their eighth win in the past nine series at home. New York has won 20 of 25 at Citi Field, improving to 24-10 overall in its pitcher-friendly ballpark.	The nightcap was a makeup of Wednesday night's rainout.	In the opener, the lack of run support was nothing new for Santana (4-3), who pitched 15 shutout innings over his previous two starts without getting a decision. This time, he squandered a two-run lead and took the loss.	"There's not much I can do," Santana said. "I just have to pitch my game. I know that sooner or later the offense is going to pick up."	The 22-year-old Latos (6-4) went six innings and struck out eight. The right-hander set down his last 13 batters, improving to 5-1 with a 1.96 ERA and 47 strikeouts in his last seven starts.	"I know with what I've got, if I can get ahead in the count 0-2, 1-2, I've got stuff that I can put away a lot of guys," Latos said.	Then, the Padres turned to their dominant bullpen. Luke Gregerson fanned all three batters in the seventh, Mike Adams worked a perfect eighth and ex-Met Heath Bell pitched the ninth for his 17th save in 20 chances.	"We have a great TEAM," Bell said. "You put us individually, we might not be the best guys out there. But you put us together, and we're solid."	Game notes	 Santana's scoreless streak ended at 18 2/3 innings. ... San Diego was shut out for the third time this season.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

Josh Hamilton homered for the fourth time in seven games, Michael Young went 3 for 4 with a homer, and the Rangers won their third straight over the Mariners, 12-3 on Thursday night.	Texas improved to 8-2 against Seattle this season, outscoring the Mariners 31-6 in the final three games of the four-game series.	"Everyone is pulling their weight," Rangers manager Ron Washington said of his offense. "I hope we can continue it. (The Mariners) got some pitches up in the zone and we haven't missed 'em."	Hamilton got the Rangers' offense rolling with a two-run homer in a three-run first.	Hamilton had three RBIs, giving him 13 during a seven-game homestand. Hamilton has driven in at least one run in seven straight games, the longest streak by a Ranger this season.	Julio Borbon added three hits for Texas. Vladimir Guerrero, Justin Smoak and David Murphy all had two hits and two RBIs for the Rangers.	"One guy hits, and it takes off from there," Borbon said.	The Rangers, who had 17 hits, increased their lead in the AL West to 1 1/2 games over the Los Angeles Angels.	Seattle has lost six of seven to fall 10 games behind Texas in the division, but Washington said the Mariners aren't out of the race quite yet.	"Before 162 games are over, I'm quite sure you'll hear from Seattle," Washington said.	Texas' Tommy Hunter (2-0) allowed three runs -- two earned -- and five hits in six innings of his second major league start this season.	Hunter threw a five-hitter in a 6-1 victory over Tampa Bay on Saturday in his season debut.	This time, his run support was far better.	"It's fun to pitch like that," Hunter said. "When your team gets 17 hits, it makes it a lot easier to pitch."	Michael Saunders and Chone Figgins had two hits each for the Mariners.	Two Seattle errors led to eight unearned runs in the kind of sloppy performance that has hurt the Mariners all season.	"They had eight unearned runs on ground balls, on plays that should have been made," Seattle manager Don Wakamatsu said. "We're embarrassed. There are no excuses."	Texas jumped on Ryan Rowland-Smith (0-5) for a three-run first on Guerrero's RBI single and Hamilton's two-run homer.	Seattle scored twice in the third with the help of a throwing error by Borbon in center field.	Saunders started the third with a single, and scored from first when Borbon's throw to third on Figgins' single sailed into the Seattle dugout. Figgins went to third on the overthrow, and later scored on Franklin Gutierrez's sacrifice fly to get within 3-2.	But Texas kept up the offensive pressure as Young led off the third with a homer, and the Rangers got another run when Figgins made a fielding error at second on Smoak's grounder. Guerrero scored on Murphy's ground out, and Matt Treanor added an RBI single for a 7-2 lead.	Texas broke the game open with a five-run sixth -- all the runs were unearned -- highlighted by Smoak's two-run double. Seattle shortstop Josh Wilson's fielding error gave the Rangers the opening for an outburst that included RBI singles from Guerrero, Hamilton and Murphy.	Rowland-Smith allowed eight runs -- four earned -- and 11 hits over 5 2/3 innings. He hasn't won since last October when Seattle beat Texas 2-1.	Game notes	Ichiro Suzuki was Seattle's DH rather than in RF to rest his legs. Suzuki went 0 for 4 with three strikeouts and was 1 for 15 in the four-game series. ... Mariners LF Milton Bradley got the day off. ... Rangers LHP Derek Holland said he's not overly concerned after he was shut down halfway through a bullpen session on Wednesday when he felt a "pinch" in his left shoulder. Holland, who's on the 15-day DL with left rotator cuff inflammation, will throw off flat ground Friday in Milwaukee. The Rangers have no plans for Holland to undergo an MRI on the shoulder. ... Mariners C Adam Moore (left fibula) has advanced from extended spring training in Arizona to Triple-A Tacoma to continue his injury rehab. ... LHP Erik Bedard threw 50 pitches in the bullpen on Thursday and will throw a simulated game Tuesday in St. Louis. Bedard is rehabbing from left shoulder surgery.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO -- Ozzie Guillen couldn't help himself after A.J. Pierzynski came through with his best performance this season.	And no, the manager wasn't exactly heaping praise.	"They talked about us trading him two months ago," Guillen said. "Then, the scouts started watching him."	If they saw this, they'd be impressed.	Pierzynski and Alex Rios each had four hits and homered to back a strong start by Jake Peavy, and the Chicago White Sox won their third straight, beating the crosstown Cubs 10-5 on Friday afternoon.	The four hits tied a season high for Rios and set one for Pierzynski, who also drove in a season-best three runs. The White Sox, meanwhile, matched their longest win streak.	Pierzynski raised his average to .237 on a muggy afternoon in which he singled in a run during a two-run first, doubled home another in a three-run fifth off Randy Wells and homered off Jeff Stevens in the seventh. He is 10 for 19 in his past four games against the Cubs -- all White Sox wins.	He becomes a 10-and-five player on Monday, meaning he'll have the right to waive any trade, and Pierzynski made two things clear. He wants to stay with the White Sox, and he's had that date circled.	"All the trade talk, this and that, I'm a human being," he said. "Every person goes through it. I've said all along I just want to get through Sunday so it all goes away."	Rios capped a four-run eighth against James Russell with a two-run drive that made it 10-2, after Carlos Quentin went deep leading off while batting for Peavy (5-5).	That was plenty for the former NL Cy Young Award winner, who had dropped three of four starts. He has pitched better lately, allowing two runs and six hits over seven innings in each of his past two starts.	He did give up Alfonso Soriano's 300th homer -- a two-run shot that tied it at 2 in the second -- but came away with his 100th career win.	Paul Konerko had two hits, including the tiebreaking two-run double in the fifth, and drove in two while scoring twice.	"There are a lot of things that still can happen," said Rios, who's hitting .322. "We haven't quit and we're not going to."	They got the best of Wells (3-5). He is 0-5 with a 6.47 ERA in his past eight starts after allowing five runs and 10 hits in five innings. He has not won since beating Arizona on April 30.	"I'm not going to lie," Wells said. "I'm not exactly beaming with confidence right now."	It's been a rough season for both teams, taking some of the shine off the crosstown series.	Guillen acknowledged tension with general manager Ken Williams and said the relationship needs to improve if they're going to keep working together. That comment came on the heels of a Chicago Sun-Times report that the two nearly came to blows this week after the organization drafted the manager's son Ozney in the 22nd round.	Cubs manager Lou Piniella snapped at critics before the game, calling out White Sox announcer Steve Stone for questioning his handling of prized rookie outfielder Tyler Colvin.	The only good sports vibes in Chicago are surrounding the Blackhawks, who beat Philadelphia to capture the Stanley Cup. There were plenty of Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews jerseys in the crowd.	Fans also drowned out the national anthem, just as they do before hockey games at the United Center, but the cheers turned to boos when the BP Crosstown Cup was presented behind home plate before the game -- a loud message to the embattled oil company and title sponsor of the series.	The White Sox wasted little time jumping on Wells, who allowed run-scoring singles by Andruw Jones and Pierzynski in another rough first inning.	That follows a recent pattern that includes a loss to St. Louis on May 28 in which he failed to retire a batter and another against Houston on Sunday when he gave up three runs in the first.	Soriano became the second Cub in three days to reach 300 homers, joining Derrek Lee, when he lined a two-run shot over the center-field wall in the second, after Marlon Byrd got hit, for his 10th homer and his first in 44 at-bats. The home run was Soriano's third and seventh hit in 17 at-bats against Peavy, but a rough outing for Wells led to another loss for the Cubs.	"He's a competitor, and I feel that he'll turn this thing around and give us good performances," Piniella said.	Game notes	 The game was delayed 21 minutes at the start due to the threat of rain. ... Soriano is the 127th major leaguer to hit 300 homers. ... Konerko has a 16-game hitting streak at Wrigley Field dating to 2004.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BALTIMORE -- The ball had virtually no spin, yet it came at the plate with surprising velocity. Even though the Baltimore Orioles knew what was coming, they were rendered helpless by R.A. Dickey's knuckleball.	Dickey baffled the Orioles for seven innings, Chris Carter hit his first major league homer, and the New York Mets coasted to a 5-1 victory Friday night.	Dickey (4-0) gave up one run and seven hits to win his fourth straight start. The right-hander had a career-high eight strikeouts, including Corey Patterson three times and Adam Jones twice.	"I had a really good knuckleball tonight. I had it from the beginning and felt comfortable with it, and was able to make some big pitches with it," Dickey said. "I just kept trusting it."	Dickey said he threw only five fastballs, which makes perfect sense because his knuckler was so effective.	"It was a lot faster than the average knuckleball. It was, what, 74 to 80 [mph]? It was power and it moved," Jones said. "It's like trying to play catch with your friends and you throw knuckleballs, and every once in a while it's a good one."	And Dickey's?	"Every time," Jones said.	"That was the best knuckleball I've ever seen," said Baltimore's Luke Scott, who struck out and twice grounded out meekly. "Hard, with late movement."	Since his promotion from Triple-A Buffalo on May 19, the 35-year-old Dickey has gone at least six innings in each of his five starts and has a 2.78 ERA.	Of his 109 pitches against Baltimore, 75 were strikes.	"A lot of swings and misses," Dickey said. "When you see hitters of that caliber swing and miss, you feel good about what you have that night. That's a good lineup. I know they don't have a good record, but they have a lot of proven hitters over there."	Carter hit a three-run shot in the fourth inning to stake the Mets to a 4-0 lead against Jeremy Guthrie (3-7). The drive came on his 51st at-bat in the big leagues, including 23 with Boston over the past two seasons.	"I was like, in my head, 'Oh, my God, is that going out?' It was a great feeling," Carter said. "He threw a changeup [and] I just kept everything back. I just had a lot of adrenaline going too, and I think that played in my favor."	David Wright had three hits and two RBIs for the Mets, who won for the sixth time in seven games and improved their road record to 9-18. New York has not yet captured a road series and hasn't recorded consecutive wins on the road since July 25-26 in Houston.	All that can change Saturday, when the Mets again face the last-place Orioles, who have lost 13 of 15.	Baltimore went 3 for 17 with runners in scoring position and struck out a season-high 12 times. The Orioles' lone run came when Patterson scored on a wild pitch by Dickey in the seventh.	"We got some hits; we did not get the big ones," interim manager Juan Samuel said.	Guthrie allowed four runs and seven hits in seven innings. He has lost his last three starts, and after this one the right-hander joked that it might be worthwhile to add a knuckleball to his repertoire.	"Maybe I should try one of those, because it looked like it was tough to hit," Guthrie said.	The Mets went up 1-0 in the first when Jose Reyes led off with a double and scored on a single by Wright. Jones saved another run with an outstanding diving catch in center field on a hooking liner hit by Jason Bay.	Carter connected in the fourth after Ike Davis singled and Bay drew a walk.	In the bottom half, the Orioles loaded the bases with no outs before Dickey struck out Scott and Jones, then retired Matt Wieters on a popup.	"That was possibly the game right there," Mets manager Jerry Manuel said.	Baltimore also wasted a leadoff double by Nick Markakis in the sixth.	Wright doubled in a run in the eighth off Brad Bergesen, making his first career relief appearance.	Game notes	 New York's interleague record improved to 108-107 (14-9 vs. Baltimore). ... Wright is batting .462 in his last 11 games. ... Opposing starters have pitched at least six innings against the Orioles in 46 of 61 games.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DETROIT -- The bottom of the Detroit Tigers' lineup has been maligned for a lack of production.	It couldn't be Friday night.	Ninth hitter Ramon Santiago had a two-run homer and the bottom third of the order combined to drive in five runs, helping the Tigers beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 6-2.	"That's why we won the game," Detroit manager Jim Leyland said.	Brandon Inge and Alex Avila, two weak-hitting Tigers, each had three hits and combined to drive in three runs.	"It's good to see," said Inge, who has a seven-game hitting streak. "You can't rely on a couple guys all year."	Detroit has been leaning on Miguel Cabrera, who was 0-for-4 against Pittsburgh, and Magglio Ordonez, who missed a fourth straight game because of an oblique strain that the team doesn't think is a serious injury.	Brennan Boesch hit a solo shot in a three-run fourth inning, giving the rookie four homers in seven games and eight this season.	"When he hits it, it's a loud sound," Leyland said.	Justin Verlander can create a pop with his fastballs, too, but many of them were not thrown for strikes against the Pirates.	Verlander (7-4) got away with it, though, giving up just two runs on four hits while matching a season high with four walks in seven-plus innings.	"My fastball was horrible," Verlander said, crediting stellar defense behind him.	Detroit center fielder Austin Jackson led the way defensively, making a pair of back-to-the-plate, underhanded catches that are starting to look routine for the speedy rookie.	"Unbelievable," Leyland said.	Ross Ohlendorf (0-4) allowed six runs -- all with two outs -- and 10 hits in six innings.	"The bottom of the order just killed me, especially with two outs," he said.	Both starters didn't give up a hit until the third, when Andrew McCutchen's RBI double put Pittsburgh ahead 1-0.	McCutchen doubled to lead off the eighth and Neil Walker walked on four pitches, chasing Verlander. Phil Coke got Ryan Doumit to hit into a double play, and then Garrett Jones hit an RBI single to make it 6-2.	Jose Valverde pitched the ninth and didn't give up a run for his 24th straight outing. Valverde did allow a one-out walk before closing the game with a fielder's choice and a strikeout.	Detroit had lost four of six.	The Pirates have lost six straight, one short of their season high set in late April.	"You can't give Justin Verlander six runs and beat him," Pittsburgh manager John Russell said.	Game notes	 Detroit right-hander Rick Porcello (4-6, 6.09 ERA) will have his next start skipped so he can work on his sinker. ... Ohlendorf matched career highs for earned runs and hits. ... Ndamukong Suh, who the Detroit Lions drafted No. 2 overall, threw the first pitch. ... Verlander has allowed two or fewer runs in five of his last six starts. ... Detroit's Don Kelly made a catch in the stands on the third-base line side of the park against Walker, his brother-in-law, who then returned the favor by making a sliding catch in foul territory against Kelly. ... McCutchen matched a career with two doubles. ... Avila matched a career high with three hits.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

NEW YORK -- Andy Pettitte got a bunch of hugs from appreciative teammates, and a ball and a big grin from Mariano Rivera. Then his former pitching coach and Yankees great Ron Guidry called with congratulations.	This was no ordinary victory.	Pettitte threw 7 1/3 sharp innings to become the third player to earn 200 wins with New York, beating his hometown Houston Astros 4-3 on Friday night.	"It's special," he said. "There's not a lot of guys that have won that many games as a Yankee, so it's a good thing."	Francisco Cervelli hit a two-out, two-run single in New York's three-run first inning, and Mark Teixeira added an RBI single in the fifth, also with two outs.	Pettitte (8-1) allowed two earned runs and four hits in his first start against his former team, improving to 3-0 with a 2.10 ERA in his last four games. He struck out four after recording a season-high 10 Ks in his previous outing last Saturday at Toronto.	"He just really buckled down and started making pitch after pitch after pitch," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.	Pettitte, a Louisiana native who lives in the Houston suburb of Deer Park, played for the Astros from 2004-06, going 37-26 with a 3.38 ERA. He is still close to Houston first baseman Lance Berkman and right-hander Roy Oswalt.	"It's like facing an older brother in Wiffle Ball," Berkman said. "You're torn because you want to do well, but you don't want to hurt him. But then he puts his glove over his face and it's like facing Darth Vader."	Tommy Manzella hit a two-run double in the second for Houston, which had won three straight and eight of 10. Brett Myers (4-4) allowed four runs and five hits in seven innings.	The Astros returned to the Bronx on the seventh anniversary of their combined no-hitter at the old Yankee Stadium. Houston used Oswalt and five relievers in the first no-hitter at New York since 1952, setting a record for the most pitchers to combine on a hitless gem.	Missing Alex Rodriguez, the Yankees kicked off a nine-game homestand with their sixth consecutive win at their second-year ballpark and fourth win in five games overall. Rodriguez is day to day after an MRI revealed tendinitis in his right hip flexor.	"To me, it's my groin. It's all pretty connected there," said Rodriguez, who missed the beginning of last season after hip surgery. "But I feel pretty good and again, the most important part, the MRI came out negative and we feel good about that."	Pettitte also reached 3,000 career innings when he retired the first two batters of the game, joining Philadelphia's Jamie Moyer as the only active pitchers to reach the mark. Whitey Ford and Red Ruffing are the only other players to reach 200 wins with the Yankees, and Pettitte snapped a tie with Ford for 58th on the career list with win No. 237 for good measure.	"I just feel very fortunate, very blessed to have been able to play in this organization," Pettitte said.	The left-hander, who turns 38 on Tuesday, got a warm ovation from the crowd of 46,883 when he left with runners on second and third. Jeff Keppinger hit a sacrifice fly off Joba Chamberlain to cut it to 4-3 before Berkman struck out swinging to end the inning.	Berkman thought he checked his swing on the 2-2 pitch and flipped his bat and helmet in disgust as he went to take his position in the field.	Rivera worked a perfect ninth for his 15th save in 16 opportunities.	The Yankees got off to a fast start against Myers, even with Rodriguez and outfielder Brett Gardner (sprained left thumb) on the bench. They loaded the bases with one out and Nick Swisher drew a full-count walk to give New York the lead.	After Jorge Posada struck out, Cervelli bounced an 0-2 pitch from Myers up the middle to make it 3-0.	"I felt like I was rushing my mechanics," Myers said. "If I'd been better than that in the first inning, we would have had a better chance to win."	Myers helped himself with a nice stab on Cervelli's liner in the sixth before throwing to first for the double play. Second baseman Keppinger made a great play on Ramiro Pena's bouncer in the fourth and center fielder Michael Bourn had a solid running catch on Derek Jeter's drive in the seventh.	"He made a Gold Glove play the way he chased that ball down," Astros manager Brad Mills said of Bourn's grab.	Teixeira's looper in the fifth landed just over the head of Keppinger and drove in Kevin Russo to make it 4-2.	Game notes	 Oswalt, who has wondered aloud if a trade might be best for him and the team, is keeping his options open. New York "is just as good as every other city," the Mississippi native said. "Every city I go to is big. It's different from where I grew up but baseball is baseball no matter where you play." General manager Ed Wade refused to talk about any potential deals. "I think there's really no value to it, on our part," he said. ... C Posada looked sharp during pregame fielding drills. He has been limited to DH duties since he came off the DL after being sidelined with a broken right foot.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

BOSTON -- Jamie Moyer has had a long, successful career as a contact pitcher. The Boston Red Sox made plenty of contact in the worst start of his 24 seasons on Friday night.	David Ortiz drove in four runs, Boston led 12-0 after three innings and the Red Sox pounded out 17 hits to beat the Philadelphia Phillies 12-2.	"It was quite obvious," Moyer said. "I didn't execute and when I did they hit the ball hard."	The 47-year-old left-hander allowed nine runs on nine hits, including six doubles and Mike Lowell's two-run homer, and left after failing to retire any of the first four batters in the second inning. He doesn't throw particularly hard and tries to get batters to put the ball in play.	John Lackey (7-3) won his third straight decision, giving up two runs and six hits in seven innings.	All the runs against Moyer (6-6) were earned. He had given up between nine and 11 earned runs in five of his other 620 starts before Friday, but the shortest stint in those shaky outings was 3 2/3 innings. He's lasted one inning or less in only five of his career starts. And his career ERA at Fenway Park against Boston rose from 6.43 to 7.59.	"I felt like I was pitching behind in the count the whole night," he said. "You can't do that as a contact pitcher. I'm going to give up hits, but when you space them out you have a chance. When they clump them together it makes it tough."	Boston added three runs in the third off David Herndon.	Ortiz and Marco Scutaro each had three hits for Boston, which opened a nine-game interleague homestand against Philadelphia, Arizona and the Los Angeles Dodgers.	The key to the offense was patience and not swinging too soon at Moyer's soft serves.	"Against Moyer, you better (hit) up the middle," Boston manager Terry Francona said, "or you're going to get out front. He's going to frustrate you. The guys stayed on (his pitches) real well."	The Phillies lost for the 15th time in 22 games, a span in which they've managed just 53 runs.	"When we get pitching we haven't been hitting at all," Philadelphia manager Charlie Manuel said, "and then, all of a sudden, when we start swinging the bats a little bit better then we get a bad-pitched game and then we play sloppy defense."	The Red Sox, who started the season focusing on run prevention, lead the American League in runs, hits and doubles and are second in homers.	"Nobody knows how things are going to be," Ortiz said. "You might take your chances guessing, but we have players that are capable of doing some damage and that's what's going on."	Moyer walked the first batter he faced, Scutaro, who was forced out at second on Dustin Pedroia's grounder. Then the onslaught began with consecutive doubles by Victor Martinez, Ortiz and Adrian Beltre, and then Lowell's second homer of the year that made it 5-0.	Scutaro opened the second with a single before the next three batters, -- Pedroia, Ortiz and Martinez -- all doubled in runs. Boston's ninth run scored when Lowell grounded into a double play.	The Red Sox began the third with three straight hits off Herndon -- singles by Mike Cameron and Darnell McDonald and an RBI single by Scutaro. Then Ortiz hit a two-run single with two outs for a 12-0 lead.	"Once the guys start swinging the bats like that, you want to pound the strike zone," Lackey said. "You want to try to get (your) guys back in the dugout as quick as you can because they're feeling good at the plate and you want to get them back up there."	Lackey allowed just a hit and a walk with two strikeouts in the first three innings. But in the fourth, Ryan Howard singled, took third on a double by Jayson Werth and scored on a groundout by Raul Ibanez.	Philadelphia got its second run in the seventh when Werth singled, went to third on Ross Gload's double and scored on Carlos Ruiz's groundout.	Game notes	 The big lead gave Boston 2B Pedroia a chance to rest his painful right knee when manager Terry Francona removed him from the game in the top of the sixth. ... Moyer was 7-1 with Boston in 1996. ... Red Sox 1B Kevin Youkilis missed the game with back spasms. ... Jason Varitek's eighth-inning double gave the Red Sox eight in a game for the first time since Aug. 18, 2006, when they had eight against the New York Yankees. ... Moyer faced 13 batters and threw 61 pitches. In his previous start, a complete game 6-2 win over San Diego, he threw 98 pitches.

From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CINCINNATI -- Ned Yost made seven pitching changes and got to thinking about which position player might take the mound if the game kept going.	Felt like he was back in the National League all over again.	The former Milwaukee Brewers manager used his entire bullpen to prevent the Cincinnati Reds from pulling off yet another last-minute win Friday night, and Yuniesky Betancourt completed his big game with a run-scoring single in the 11th inning, sending the Kansas City Royals to a 6-5 interleague win.	"That was National League ball right there," said Yost, who took over when Trey Hillman was fired last month. "We pulled every string we could pull to try to win that game, and it worked out good. Everybody had a part in this one tonight. I had one player left and I was saving him in case I had to pitch a position player."	Betancourt let the Royals -- who arrived in town at 3 a.m. -- finally relax. He had an RBI double and a two-run homer that put Kansas City up 5-4.	"He killed us all night," Reds manager Dusty Baker said. "We had plenty of opportunities. It's tough, especially when you've been so good at picking up baserunners."	The Reds lead the majors in comeback wins, pulling out 12 of them in their last at-bat. They tied it in the eighth, but stranded runners in scoring position in each of the last three innings.	Micah Owings (3-2) set up the Royals' final rally by walking Billy Butler and Brayan Pena, who is only 2-for-18 this season. Betancourt singled to center, breaking the tie with the Royals' first hit since his homer in the sixth inning.	"It was a long game for both teams," said Butler, who scored when Drew Stubbs' off-line throw was cut off. "We had a late night getting here. I was doing all I could to score there."	Victor Marte (1-0) escaped a two-on threat in the 10th. Joakim Soria retired Scott Rolen on a sharply hit fly ball with runners on first and third to end it, getting his 15th save in 17 tries. Soria was the Royals' eighth pitcher.	Despite the loss, Cincinnati remained in first place in the NL Central. The Reds haven't led so late in a season since June 17, 2002, when they were playing at Cinergy Field.	This year, they are at the best when the game's near the end. They rallied to make this one go extra long before Owings' control problems let it slip. He walked two ahead of Betancourt's decisive single.	The Royals' Blake Wood failed to hold a 5-4 lead in the eighth, when the Reds loaded the bases with no outs. Brandon Phillips, whose eighth-inning triple set up another last at-bat win over the Giants on Thursday, got the rally started with a single that extended the longest active hitting streak in the majors to 14 games.	Jay Bruce's sacrifice fly tied it, but Wood escaped further damage. Bruce also had an RBI double and a solo homer off starter Luke Hochevar.	Hochevar gave up four runs in four innings, then was lifted for a pinch-hitter in the top of the fifth with the Royals down 4-1 and the lack of a DH coming into play. Yost decided to bat Wilson Betemit with runners on second and third and one out. Hochevar had thrown only 68 pitches -- his fewest in a game this season -- but is 0-for-8 career at the plate with seven strikeouts.	The moved worked. Betemit drew a walk from Bronson Arroyo that loaded the bases, and Scott Podsednik singled home a run that cut it to 4-2. Another scored when Jason Kendall grounded into a forceout at second base -- umpire Tim Welke started to call Kendall out at first base as well for a double play but then changed his mind and waved his arms in the "safe" signal.	Betancourt hit a two-run homer off Arroyo in the sixth for a 5-4 lead.	"I was cruising through four innings," Arroyo said. "That deep in the game, that's a lead I shouldn't give up, especially with as good of command as I had. You can't give back a four-run lead."	Game notes	 Kendall extended his hitless streak to 0-for-19. ... Reds right-hander Homer Bailey had to skip a bullpen workout Friday because of soreness in his pitching shoulder. Bailey has been on the 15-day DL since May 24 with an inflamed pitching shoulder. The setback leaves the timing of his comeback uncertain. ... Right-hander Edinson Volquez, recovering from reconstructive elbow surgery last August, is scheduled to make his first rehab start Saturday at Class A. Volquez is nearing the end of his 50-game suspension for using a banned fertility substance.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Forget the sloppy eighth and ninth innings. The Florida Marlins won the opener of the Citrus Series, and that was enough for manager Fredi Gonzalez.	Anibal Sanchez pitched seven solid innings and Gaby Sanchez homered twice and drove in a career-high six runs Friday night, leading the Marlins to a 14-9 victory over Tampa Bay and trimming the Rays' lead in the AL East to one game over the New York Yankees.	Florida committed three errors after their starting pitcher departed with a 10-run lead, allowing the team with baseball's best record -- though not by much -- to make it interesting late.	"That eighth and ninth inning we made some mistakes. But other than that, hey, we got through it," Gonzalez said.	"We won, and I don't think anybody got hurt. We'll take it. We won't give it back and we won't play it again. That's a very good club over there. If you give them opportunities you're going to have to do what we did to beat them."	The Marlins beat their intrastate rivals for just the third time in 13 tries over the past three seasons, handing Rays starter James Shields (5-5) his fourth consecutive loss while Anibal Sanchez (6-3) won for the fifth time in six starts.	Tampa Bay's division lead is its smallest since May 15.	Gaby Sanchez had four hits, including a three-run homer off Shields, who matched a career high by allowing 10 runs over 3 1/3 innings -- the right-hander's shortest outing of the season. The Marlins first baseman also had a sacrifice fly in the fifth and two-run homer in the seventh.	Anibal Sanchez yielded a two-run double to B.J. Upton and a solo homer to Carlos Pena, who tied a Rays record by going deep for the fifth consecutive game. Pena, who's batting .196, has six homers during the streak.	The Marlins went 1-5 against Tampa Bay each of the past two seasons, and the Rays have won seven of the last nine series between the teams at Tropicana Field, where the first of this year's six interleague meetings drew a crowd of 19,338.	Florida's Chris Coghlan went 4 for 4 with two walks and drove in a run, extending his hitting streak to 11 games.	Gaby Sanchez's second homer, a two-run shot off Andy Sonnanstine, put Florida up 14-3.	"It's definitely nice. But today's over and now we've got to work for tomorrow and hopefully keep it rolling," Sanchez said.	"It was one of those games I got some pitches, and I was able to put some swings on them. I'm definitely not going up there trying to hit a home run. They just kind of happen."	Tampa Bay scored once in the seventh and four times in the eighth, when Hank Blalock had a two-run single off Rick VandenHurk and the Marlins helped the Rays by dropping two popups for errors. A third error allowed another run to score in the ninth.	Anibal Sanchez allowed four runs and seven hits. He walked three and struck out four, breezing for the most part after Florida scored five runs in the third and four more in the fourth.	The Marlins loaded the bases in the third on two walks and Gaby Sanchez's bunt single that Shields couldn't field. The Rays starter looked like he might wiggle off the hook when Hanley Ramirez struck out and Jorge Cantu popped to right, but the third out was much more difficult to get.	Shields walked Dan Uggla on a 3-2 pitch, driving in a run to make it 2-0. Ross followed with a two-run single and Mike Stanton, who had three hits in his big league debut on Tuesday, finished the five-run inning by lining a two-run triple into the gap in right-centerfield.	"We were one pitch away from keeping it" 1-0," Rays manager Joe Maddon said. "It just didn't work out for us."	Sanchez's first homer made it 9-0. Ross drove in the final run charged to Shields with his fourth-inning single off Sonnanstine.	During his losing streak, Shields has allowed 25 runs and 34 hits over 23 2/3 innings. Most of the damage has come in his last three starts.	"It's unacceptable the way I'm pitching right now," Shields said. "I'm letting my team down and not giving them a chance to win."	Game notes	 The Marlins set a season-high with 14 runs. They had 15 hits, three off their season high. ... Jose Canseco homered in five straight games for the Rays from May 16-21, 1999. ... Maddon continues to tinker with his batting order. C John Jaso batted leadoff for the third time and Pena, who is emerging from a season-long slump, was moved back into the cleanup spot he occupied earlier in the season. ... Rays first-round draft pick Justin O'Connor (No. 31 overall) attended the game. He has agreed to a contract and will report to the minors next week.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MILWAUKEE -- Corey Hart kept listening. There were plenty of boos and even more chatter that the lanky right fielder was part of the problem, not the solution for the Milwaukee Brewers.	No more.	Hart hit his NL-leading 17th home run, Prince Fielder, Ryan Braun and Casey McGehee also went deep and the Brewers beat the Texas Rangers 6-2 on Friday night.	Hart won a salary arbitration case with the team, then followed with a sour spring that only increased the howls against him.	"You get tons of negativity, you get tired of it," Hart said. "But you get through it one way or another. Somehow, I was able to stay positive. It was tough. You never like to be booed, you never like to be questioned whether you should be here or not. I took that as a big chip. I deserve to be here."	Braun's two-run blast in the first set the tone, McGehee drove in his 46th run with his solo homer in the fourth and Hart and Fielder hit consecutive shots in the fifth off Rangers starter Rich Harden (3-3).	"He couldn't get the ball in on those right handers," Rangers manager Ron Washington said.	Milwaukee starter Chris Narveson (5-3) pitched a career-best seven innings and throttled the AL West-leading Rangers, who had won three straight by a combined score of 31-6 over Seattle.	Vladimir Guerrero's solo homer in the second gave him a majors-best 54 RBIs, but Texas' offense sputtered with two hits after the third.	Milwaukee has won four of its last five and got a big game from Narveson, who has barely held onto his spot in the starting rotation after a string of lackluster performances.	"I think being a young pitcher, sometimes you don't realize what it takes or what you need to do," Narveson said. "The sixth, seventh innings, those are the times you've got to make good pitches and if you make a mistake, you've got to come back and keep making quality pitches to get the outs."	The Brewers got the left-hander off to a good start, and his big breaking ball and change up kept the Rangers guessing.	Braun snapped an 11 at-bat hitless streak when he homered off the first pitch he saw from Harden to give Milwaukee a 2-0 lead.	Guerrero answered with his second-inning swat to extend his hitting streak to 10 games, and the Rangers tied it on Michael Young's RBI double in the third.	But Texas, which looked to a tie a season high at seven games over .500, failed to increase its division lead or put up another run even though Julio Borbon (nine) and Josh Hamilton (eight) also extended hitting streaks.	Hart, a former All-Star in 2008, hit .252 with 17 home runs and 81 RBIs after that exhibition game through last year, falling out of favor with the fans and eventually losing his starting job to begin the season after injuries and ineffectiveness.	"He missed a lot of at-bats last year," McGehee said. "He's a special hitter. Obviously, he's got some tools not everybody has. For him to be doing it this consistently is pretty impressive to watch."	In Hart's last 26 games, he has 14 homers and 29 RBIs.	"After the spring training and everything he went through, I don't think the fans were real happy with him," Brewers manager Ken Macha said. "I think it shows you how you can turn it around by going out there and performing.	"I'm happy for him because once again, we're out taking extra (batting practice) and he's out there. He's pretty much locked in and he continues to swing."	Game notes	 McGehee's 10th homer of the season tied Troy Glaus for the NL RBI lead at 46. ... It was the first time Texas had ever played in Miller Park and the teams' first meeting in Milwaukee since the Brewers were in the AL in 1997. ... Hamilton's RBI streak was snapped at seven games. ... Rangers OF Nelson Cruz (left hamstring) is at least a week from going on a rehab assignment after initially hoping to be activated early next week. ... Rangers LHP Derek Holland (left shoulder) continued to suffer lingering pain from a throwing session and returned to Surprise, Ariz. to rehab.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MINNEAPOLIS -- Francisco Liriano and Tim Hudson are showing that there is indeed life after Tommy John surgery.	Liriano struck out a season-high 11 batters to edge Hudson in a dazzling pitchers' duel as the Minnesota Twins beat the Atlanta Braves 2-1 on Friday night.	"You're seeing that happen more and more with people getting that surgery and coming back," Twins pitching coach Rick Anderson said. "There were two pretty good pitchers out there today that proved that you can come all the way back with it. That was a battle."	Liriano (6-3) allowed five hits in eight innings and Delmon Young's pinch-hit single in the seventh inning gave the Dominican lefty just enough run support. Jon Rauch struck out Jason Heyward, Chipper Jones and Troy Glaus in the ninth for his 16th save.	Hudson (6-2) went the distance for the Braves, allowing two runs on seven hits. Five of those came in the Twins' two-run seventh inning.	The game served as a ringing endorsement for the ligament replacement procedure that once spelled the end of a pitcher's career.	Both Hudson and Liriano are enjoying resurgent seasons this year after having the surgery.	"Liriano was outstanding," Braves manager Bobby Cox said. "It was great to watch, to be honest with you. Two outstanding pitchers going at it."	Hudson had the procedure in 2008 and appeared in only seven games last season.	The right-hander entered the game 6-1 with a 2.44 ERA and had not lost a decision since April 21. He breezed through the first six innings, allowing just two hits as the Braves took a 1-0 lead on a groundout from Omar Infante in the second inning.	He ran into a little trouble in the seventh when the Twins loaded the bases with nobody out. Hudson got Jim Thome looking, but gave up RBI singles to Jason Kubel and Young. He struck out Nick Punto and got Denard Span to ground out to limit the damage, but the Twins still managed to take a 2-1 lead.	"I can't feel better," Hudson said. "My arm's as good as it's ever been. I wish that they had similar procedures for the rest of your body, but they don't. [Liriano] looks great, too."	After an All-Star rookie season in 2006, Liriano had the surgery and missed all of 2007. Perhaps because he is a power pitcher, his return to form has taken much longer than Hudson's. Liriano labored through 2008 and 2009, but has looked like his old, dominating self this season.	Liriano fanned seven straight Braves at one point in the middle of the game, mixing his fastball and slider to devastating effect. Heyward whiffed three times against him and four times in the game.	"It means a lot," Liriano said. "I had a tough year last year."	The game Friday night kicked off the third interleague meeting between the Twins and Braves, who squared off in the epic 1991 World Series won by Minnesota in seven games.	"When you see the Braves, your thoughts immediately go to that," said Gardenhire, who was the third base coach in 1991.	Gardenhire said he ran into some baseball fans from Atlanta earlier in the day who told him, "We're coming to pay you back."	"The sad thing for them is they'll never pay us back," Gardenhire said with a big grin. "We have the ring and it will always be our ring."	Game notes	 The Twins honored Braves manager Bobby Cox before the game, recognizing him for his long and successful career. Cox is in his final season. The Twins donated $5,000 to his Homeless Pets Foundation. Ex-Twins manager Tom Kelly, who beat Cox in 1991, wished him continued success "except for the next three days." ... Nick Punto's double in the third inning gave the Twins a double in 24 straight games, the longest streak in the majors this season. ... Liriano's seven straight Ks tied a franchise record set by Jim Merritt against Washington in 1966. ... Infante left the game in the sixth inning with a bruised left foot and was taken for X-rays.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

DENVER -- Ubaldo Jimenez's latest victory came in miserable weather conditions.	Jimenez pitched through rain and problems with his command to become baseball's first 12-game winner as the Colorado Rockies beat the Toronto Blue Jays 5-3 on Friday night in an interleague game twice stalled by bad weather before being called after six innings.	"That was a gutsy performance under some very tough circumstances," Rockies manager Jim Tracy said. "He gutted out those six innings for us and gave us a chance to do for him what he's been doing for us all year."	When it began raining heavily again, officials delayed the game a second time after the sixth inning. After waiting another 40 minutes, the game was called.	Jimenez (12-1) allowed a season-high three runs and five hits in six innings, and his major league-low ERA edged up to 1.16 from 0.93 in a game whose start was delayed 1 hour, 45 minutes because of heavy rain. He won his fifth straight since his only loss of the season and remained unbeaten in five decisions at Coors Field.	But the weather, Jimenez said, prevented him from being at his best.	"It wasn't easy to be out there," he said. "I didn't really have any of my pitches. Even my fastball, I was trying to throw hard and I couldn't. The ball kept slipping out of my fingers. But I was able to keep battling and the guys picked me up."	Ricky Romero (5-3) allowed four runs and seven hits in five innings, including a tie-breaking home run by Carlos Gonzalez in the fifth inning. The Rockies added another run in the sixth on Seth Smith's sacrifice fly.	Colorado's Ryan Spilborghs had three hits, including his fourth home run.	"Neither guy had their good stuff," Toronto manager Cito Gaston said. "Ricky had a couple of quick outs and they scored three runs with two outs. I don't know if it was the mound being flat or the two guys didn't have their stuff.	"It's unfortunate we have to play in these conditions. I think the forecast is worse for tomorrow and we had to get one of these in. We were unfortunate to end up on the short end of this one."	The interleague meeting was the first between the teams at Colorado in four years. The Blue Jays lead the overall series 6-4 but have yet to win at Coors Field, having been swept in their only previous trip here in 2006.	Jimenez struggled with his command, particularly during the first several innings, when rain fell steadily.	He had nine three-ball counts, walked four, two intentionally, and had to work out of a two-out bases-loaded jam in the sixth, getting pinch-hitter Jeremy Reed to line out.	Lyle Overbay tripled with two outs in the second, scoring Vernon Wells, who reached on a leadoff walk, and Fred Lewis walked in the third ahead of Hill's ninth homer of the season.	The Rockies went in front in the fifth when Gonzalez connected for his ninth of the season, a solo shot over the right field wall that broke a 3-3 tie and helped snapped the Rockies' season-high three game losing streak.	Spilborghs got the Rockies' first run when he homered off Romero, driving an 0-2 offering over the right field fence in the second inning. Miguel Olivo followed with a single and scored on Clint Barmes' double.	In the fourth, Spilborghs doubled with two outs and Olivo followed with an RBI single.	Game notes	 Rockies closer Huston Street, on the 15-day DL with right shoulder inflammation, is set to be re-evaluated by team doctors after pitching on successive nights for Colorado Springs, the team's Triple A affiliate. ... Toronto RHP Scott Richmond (right shoulder) went 5 2/3 innings in a rehab assignment with Single A Dunedin, picking up the win over Clearwater. ... Spilborghs had his third three-hit game of the season. ... Hill's home run was Toronto's 99th of the season, a major league high. ... The rain-shortened affair went in the books as Jimenez's third complete game of the season.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PHOENIX -- Arizona's Rodrigo Lopez retired 16 straight batter at one point and still lost the game.	Brendan Ryan hit a three-run home run in the seventh inning and the St. Louis Cardinals snapped a four-game losing streak with a 5-2 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Friday night.	Ryan's drive ruined an otherwise good pitching performance from Lopez, who was cruising until he allowed back-to-back singles in the seventh. Ryan homered on the first pitch he saw from Lopez with two outs in the inning.	Ryan was mired in an 0-for-16 slump before his blast.	"It's just incredibly frustrating," Ryan said. "That at-bat ... I was really just saying I would rather be late than roll over something. I was going to be aggressive with runners in scoring position, so I was just hoping he'd make a mistake and he ended up throwing a hanging slider. I was just glad I hit it."	St. Louis scored twice in the second inning off Lopez (2-5) with doubles from Matt Holliday and Skip Schumaker. Schumaker took third on the first of three Diamondbacks errors in the game, an errant pick-off attempt by Lopez that caught second baseman Kelly Johnson off guard and bounced into center field.	Yadier Molina singled to drive in Schumaker for the Cardinals' second run.	That was all starter Jaime Garcia (6-2) and the Cardinals needed. The rookie left-hander allowed one run on four hits in five innings, lowering his ERA to 1.49.	Garcia got into a bases-loaded jam in the fourth thanks to an error and two walks, but he got Lopez to ground out to end the threat.	In the fifth, after a Conor Jackson double and with two out, manager Tony LaRussa elected to intentionally walk Arizona's Mark Reynolds to put runners on first and second. Reynolds entered the game batting .212 and was second on the team in strikeouts.	The next batter, Adam LaRoche, made the Cardinals pay when he laced a double to right field to drive in Jackson.	"He actually didn't get strike one a lot," LaRussa said of Garcia. "But he made a lot of good pitches deep in the count, which is the whole key to him surviving ... the score is very misleading. It was just a weird game and fortunately we had enough things go right for us."	The Diamondbacks loaded the bases with two outs in the ninth, but could not cash in. Arizona stranded 16 runners on base, a season high, compared to just one for the Cardinals.	"They took advantage of every oppurtunity they had, and that's the difference in the game," Diamondbacks manager A.J. Hinch said. "We had a plenty of guys on base and plenty of opportunities for a key hit, and put some nice swings on some balls."	Game notes	 LaRussa said veteran right-hander Jeff Suppan, recently released by the Milwaukee Brewers, was to join St. Louis in Arizona late Friday night. Suppan, who helped the Cardinals win the 2006 World Series, will likely join the team's battered starting rotation. ... Diamondbacks pitcher Kris Benson, on the 15-day disabled list with a right shoulder injury, is with the team and will throw bullpen sessions next weekend. ... C Miguel Montero, who has missed 57 games with a knee injury, caught a full minor-league game Thursday. ... INF Tony Abreu, who has a left wrist injury and is also on the 15-day DL, was to start a rehabilitation assignment at Triple-A Reno on Friday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

SAN DIEGO -- Late, dramatic wins for the San Diego Padres at Petco Park are starting to become routine.	Nick Hundley's sacrifice fly capped a two-run ninth inning to lift the Padres to a 4-3 win over the Seattle Mariners on Friday night.	It was San Diego's seventh win at home this season that was decided in the ninth inning or later, including four that ended on home runs. It was also the second time in less than two weeks that Hundley has supplied the game-winning swing.	"If you look at the whole [ninth] inning, it's a microcosm of where we are at," Hundley said. "We had five great at-bats just to get to me, just to give me the opportunity."	The late-inning wins have given the Padres confidence, especially at spacious Petco -- where many games are close, low-scoring affairs.	"Everybody just believes that we are going to win these games," said Chase Headley, who scored the winning run. "Even the close games we don't win, we are putting ourselves in position to win, and that gives us confidence. It's starting to build."	The late-inning loss was all-too familiar for the Mariners, who have lost 15 games in their opponents' last at-bats, including nine game-ending hits.	"When we have a chance to win, we've got to go out and win," said Seattle closer David Aardsma. "I'm the last one holding them up and obviously, I haven't done the job as well as I need to."	The victory allowed San Diego to pull into a first-place tie in the NL West with the Los Angeles Dodgers, who lost 10-1 against the Los Angeles Angels on Friday night.	Pinch hitter Will Venable led off the ninth with a single off Aardsma (0-4). He advanced to second on a David Eckstein's sacrifice. Aardsma then hit Headley to bring up Adrian Gonzalez, who doubled into the right-field corner to score Venable and tie the game 3-3.	Scott Hairston was walked intentionally to load the bases before Hundley lifted a fly ball to medium-deep right field. Ichiro Suzuki's throw was not in time to catch Headley, who scored standing up.	"I was just looking for something to drive there," Hundley said. "He threw me a fastball out over the plate that I could get out to the outfield."	Said Aardsma: "I have to go out there and get outs, and I didn't. That two-strike pitch to Venable, I left it up. If I get that out, they don't have much going that inning."	Aardsma blew a save opportunity for the fourth time this season.	Hundley also helped the Padres beat the Washington Nationals 3-2 on May 30 at home with a pinch-hit single in the 11th inning.	"I think we are all on the same page," Hundley said. "We are here to get a job done and no one cares who gets the big hit as long as we win."	Joe Thatcher (1-0) pitched a perfect ninth for the win.	Seattle lost its fourth straight and for the sixth time in seven games.	San Diego won for just the third time in its last 15 interleague home games.	Milton Bradley hit a solo homer in the sixth inning to put the Mariners ahead 3-2. Bradley connected off Kevin Correia for his fourth homer and first since May 25.	Jason Vargas allowed a pair of runs in the third inning but pitched out of a couple of jams for Seattle. The right-hander gave up seven hits, struck out five and walked two as he allowed three earned runs or less for the 11th straight start.	After falling behind 2-0, the Mariners tied the score in the fifth.	Eliezer Alfonzo led off with a double, was sacrificed to third and scored on Suzuki's ground out. Chone Figgins was hit by a pitch and scored when Franklin Gutierrez tripled off the top of center-field fence.	Gutierrez missed a home run by inches as the ball hit the padding at the top of the fence.	Bradley finished 3 for 4 and had a stolen base.	Tony Gwynn put the Padres ahead in the third with an RBI triple that scored Jerry Hairston Jr., who led off with a single. One out later, Eckstein singled in Gwynn for a 2-0 lead.	Correia gave up three runs on eight hits over six innings.	Game notes	 Seattle announced before the game that RHP Mark Lowe will have microdiscectomy surgery on his lower back Tuesday in Seattle. Lowe, the Mariners' set-up man, is likely out for the season. ... Padres manager Bud Black left during the game to catch a flight so he can attend his daughter's graduation from Oregon State on Saturday. Black will also miss Saturday night's game. Bench coach Ted Simmons took over the managerial duties. ... Mariners bench coach Ty Van Burkleo missed Friday's game to attend his son's high school graduation in Northern California.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

LOS ANGELES -- Joel Pineiro knew his stuff was good when the ground balls kept coming. He was almost as good at the plate, becoming the first Angels pitcher to score three runs in a game since 1962.	Pineiro pitched a five-hitter for his second complete game win of the season and the rest of the Angels gave him a big offensive cushion in a 10-1 victory over the Dodgers on Friday night.	"I felt good all the way. I was able to relax and (Mike) Napoli called a great game," Pineiro said. "I made sure to keep the ball down in the zone."	Hideki Matsui and Torii Hunter had three-run doubles, helping the Angels win for the eighth time in 10 games and snapping the Dodgers' four-game winning streak.	"That's a great ballgame against a team scoring a lot of runs," Angels manager and former Dodgers catcher Mike Scioscia said.	When he wasn't busy on the basepaths, Pineiro (5-6) was dictating from the mound in the Freeway Series opener between two surging teams. The right-hander struck out seven, walked one and retired his final 14 batters to earn his second straight win.	"It seemed like he had command of all of his pitches and he just kept us off-balance," Dodgers catcher Russell Martin said.	Pineiro was especially effective against the heart of the Dodgers' lineup. Matt Kemp, Andre Ethier, Manny Ramirez and James Loney were a combined 1 for 15. Ethier walked once, while Loney's home run in the fourth was the lone Dodgers' run. Kemp is 0 for 11 in his last three games.	"He pitched that way against us last year," Dodgers manager Joe Torre said. "He's that type of pitcher where if his stuff is working and stays down, you're going to have to be very patient with him."	The three runs by Pineiro, who never bats in the AL and didn't get a hit Friday, were the most scored by an Angels pitcher since Ken McBride did so on June 10, 1962, against Kansas City. Before Friday, Pineiro had only scored 10 runs in his nine-year career.	"That's not something you expect, but he's been in the batter's box before," Scioiscia said. "He was definitely setting the table. He finished strong. His last 10 pitches were strong."	Chad Billingsley (6-4) gave up seven runs and nine hits in 5 2/3 innings. He struck out three and walked three in losing his second straight, while his seven earned runs were a career-high.	"I can't explain it. I mean, I felt good out there and felt like I had pretty good stuff," he said. "But they just found holes, and you can't do much about that. I did leave some balls up in the zone, but I thought I had pretty good command."	Pineiro scored the Angels' first run on Bobby Abreu's two-out single in the second. Loney's homer tied it.	Billingsley walked Pineiro in consecutive innings.	"When you get the pitcher up there, you just want to throw strikes and not worry about being too perfect," he said. "Sometimes you find yourself aiming the ball."	Martin added, "I'm sure the last thing he wanted to do was walk the pitcher. You've got to make him earn his way on."	Matsui doubled to right field with two outs in the fifth, giving the Angels a 4-1 lead. The ball deflected off Ethier's glove as he made a diving attempt, allowing Pineiro, Erick Aybar and Hunter to score.	The Angels added four runs in the sixth. Reliever George Sherrill walked Abreu, the first batter he faced, with the bases loaded, bringing in Pineiro. Hunter's three-run double extended their lead to 8-1.	Pineiro took a called third strike in his fourth at-bat.	Howie Kendrick added a two-run homer in the ninth.	Game notes	 Hunter got hit on his left elbow by a pitch in the fifth. "It hurt so bad. It was a not-so-funny bone," he said. ... Pineiro became the first pitcher to throw a complete game against the Dodgers since Houston's Roy Oswalt last July 17. ...

SAN FRANCISCO -- Tim Lincecum acknowledges his confidence took a hit during his recent rough patch.	"I looked like I was lost," he said. "I'm finding my way. ... I've quit doubting myself."	It sure seems that way -- and it didn't hurt to get plenty of support and even see a couple of balls clear the fences.	Pat Burrell hit a go-ahead two-run homer in his Giants home debut back in his native Bay Area, helping Lincecum end a four-start winless streak and lead San Francisco past the Oakland Athletics 6-2 on Friday night in the Bay Bridge Series.	Bengie Molina added a two-run shot in the sixth off Gio Gonzalez (6-4), ending a 98 at-bat homerless streak.	"It feels pretty good. It's just been so long," Molina said.	The two runs from Burrell's homer doubled the Giants' total from all three games of a sweep by the A's last month in Oakland. His first drive since joining San Francisco on June 4 also snapped a 22-inning scoreless streak against the A's.	Lincecum (6-2), the two-time reigning NL Cy Young Award winner, won for the first time since May 15 against Houston and ended a two-start skid at home.	The right-hander sure seems back on track. He allowed two runs and seven hits, struck out seven and walked one in eight innings. His fastball found its spots and his off-speed stuff was right on target, too.	"That's the Timmy we know," manager Bruce Bochy said. "More than anything it was the rhythm he had going. His confidence grew. It looks like he's back on track. That's big for us."	Brian Wilson relieved Jeremy Affeldt in the ninth with two outs and runners on the corners, getting Cliff Pennington on a called third strike to end the 2-hour, 21-minute game for his 16th save in 18 chances.	Bochy moved rookie Buster Posey up to the No. 3 hole for the first time and dropped the struggling Pablo Sandoval to seventh. Posey delivered with an RBI triple in the seventh, when San Francisco scored another run on Tyson Ross' wild pitch.	The hit gave Posey a 10-game hitting streak, longest by an NL rookie in 2010.	Oakland's Kevin Kouzmanoff extended his career-best hitting streak to 12 games with an RBI single in the first that scored Ryan Sweeney after he advanced twice on wild pitches. It took Lincecum 17 pitches to get through the inning. After that, he cruised.	"As you get older, you expect more out of yourself, so the struggles are harder to take," Lincecum said. "It's nice to find my way out of the hole and know it's not an endless hole."	Gabe Gross grounded out to end the first, starting a stretch in which Lincecum retired 16 of 17 batters and allowed only a one-out walk to Mark Ellis in the third before Kouzmanoff singled leading off the seventh. Jack Cust had a pinch-hit RBI single in the eighth for the A's, who were managed by bench coach Tye Waller as Bob Geren was attending the high school graduation of his son, Bobby.	Gonzalez lost for the first time in six starts since a defeat May 12 at Texas. The lefty combined with closer Andrew Bailey on a three-hit shutout of San Francisco on May 22.	"They did their homework and they went out there and showed it," Gonzalez said.	The Giants were eager to make up for that awful series against the A's.	"We remember," Molina said. "We're not trying to put these games as being key to the season but we want to come out and score some runs. Guys were pumped. I hope we bring that same intensity tomorrow."	Gonzalez struck out on four pitches in his first career at-bat and first since 2006 while with Double-A Reading in the Phillies organization. He was 2 for 16 that season.	"He took one, then made a funny comment like, 'Whoa, that was fast,' " Molina said.	Ellis stole second against Lincecum in the third. Runners have gone 17 of 17 on steal attempts with Lincecum on the mound dating to last season, including 14 for 14 this year.	But Ellis also was called out in a close play at the plate in the first inning on a throw home from Posey at first.	The Giants improved to 5-0 while wearing their "Orange Friday" home jerseys, outscoring opponents 28-7.	Game notes	 Giants LF Mark DeRosa, sidelined while dealing with numbness and nerve irritation in his left wrist and hand, was undergoing further tests Friday. A decision on the next step for him could be made in the coming days, and surgery is a possibility. ... Oakland CF Rajai Davis, whose left hamstring tightened up on a triple Monday, missed his fourth straight start but was expected to return to the lineup Saturday. ... C Landon Powell was called up from Triple-A Sacramento to replace Kurt Suzuki, who is on the bereavement list for the weekend series. ... The Giants sold out for the eighth time this season (41,817).	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

NEW YORK -- Playing without Alex Rodriguez again, the New York Yankees found plenty of power elsewhere.	Derek Jeter homered twice, Jorge Posada snapped out of a slump with his first grand slam in nearly six years and New York beat the Houston Astros 9-3 on Saturday behind another solid outing by Javier Vazquez.	"Everybody's got to step up -- with him or without him," Posada said, referring to Rodriguez.	Vazquez (6-5) pitched seven solid innings for his third straight win and fourth in five starts.	Jeter hit a leadoff shot and drove in four runs for the Yankees, who roughed up struggling left-hander Wandy Rodriguez and beat Houston for the second consecutive day.	New York moved to a season-best 16 games over .500 at 39-23 with its seventh home victory in a row -- also a season high.	Hunter Pence and Carlos Lee hit long solo homers for the Astros, who had won three straight and eight of 10 before arriving at Yankee Stadium.	In the bottom of the first, Jeter sent a 2-0 pitch from Wandy Rodriguez (3-9) into the Houston bullpen for his 24th career leadoff homer, tying Hall of Famer Rickey Henderson for the franchise record.	"We don't really think too much about our place in history while we're playing," Jeter said. "If you play long enough and you're consistent enough, good things are going to happen."	Pence homered leading off the second and Jeff Keppinger's third-inning RBI double put Houston ahead 2-1. But the Yankees came right back in the bottom half, when their first five batters reached safely against Wandy Rodriguez.	"It just seemed like he couldn't get where he wanted to be. We've talked about trying to stop innings when the other team is getting base runners and he just couldn't stop that inning," Houston manager Brad Mills said. "His command wasn't there and he kept getting behind hitters."	Jeter drew a leadoff walk, stole second and went to third on catcher Humberto Quintero's throwing error. Nick Swisher hit an RBI single, Mark Teixeira walked and Robinson Cano reached on an infield single that deflected off Rodriguez's glove, loading the bases.	Batting right-handed, Posada went with a low-outside pitch and lifted it to right-center for his eighth career slam and first since July 26, 2004, at Toronto. He snapped a 4-for-34 skid since coming off the disabled list and became the eighth player to hit 250 homers with the Yankees.	"It's meaningful. It's not just another home run," said Posada, given the milestone ball in a clear case as a souvenir. "Not so many catchers get to be in this spot."	While waiting for medical clearance to get back behind the plate, Posada has been limited to DH duties since he was activated June 2 after being sidelined with a broken right foot.	He said being the designated hitter is tough, and he was happy to hear that he'll catch on Sunday.	"It's been a battle," Posada said. "During the year you're going to go through times when you have no idea what you're doing. That's been the case."	Rodriguez was lifted after consecutive walks to start the sixth. One out later, Jeter homered to right-center off Jeff Fulchino to make it 9-3.	It was Jeter's ninth career multihomer game and first since Aug. 27, 2006, at the Los Angeles Angels.	Vazquez scattered six hits, struck out six and did not walk a batter for the first time in 11 starts this season. After a slow start in his second stint with the Yankees, the right-hander has gone seven innings in each of his last three outings.	"It was just a matter of getting my mind right," Vazquez said. "I'm throwing strikes, being aggressive."	Rodriguez was tagged for eight runs, seven hits and five walks in five-plus innings, dropping to 1-5 in his past six starts.	"I was using my breaking ball a lot today. I think they were looking for it," he said.	Game notes	 Astros LHP Tim Byrdak pitched a scoreless eighth after a cortisone shot Friday helped his ailing lower back. ... Houston slugger Lance Berkman is 1 for 23 in six games on this road trip. ... Yankees OF Brett Gardner replaced Marcus Thames (strained right hamstring) in LF to start the fifth. Gardner sat out the previous two days with a sprained left thumb but took batting practice before the game and said his thumb felt good. Thames went for an MRI, which was negative. ... Kevin Russo started at 3B in Alex Rodriguez's place and batted ninth. ... It was Jeter's first leadoff homer this season. ... The Yankees are 21-7 at home.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BOSTON -- Daniel Nava gave his parents a great home video.	Nava hit the first pitch he saw as a big leaguer for a grand slam -- only the second player to do it -- leading the Boston Red Sox to their second straight rout of the Philadelphia Phillies, 10-2 Saturday.	Nava connected on a fastball from Joe Blanton in the second inning, shortly after being called up from Triple-A Pawtucket. Kevin Kouzmanoff hit a slam on the first pitch he saw Sept. 2, 2006, for Cleveland against Texas, according to STATS LLC.	With his parents watching from the stands -- and father operating a video camera -- Nava came to bat with the Red Sox trailing 2-1.	"It's funny. They really hadn't seen me play in the last two years," he said. "They were in Indianapolis to watch me play on Friday and I told them I might be playing up here."	His parents overcame a bit of travel trauma to get to Fenway Park in time for their son's debut. His mom said that when the luggage was slow to arrive at the airport, they left it there and headed straight to the ballpark.	Nava often was regarded as too little to play during his career at all levels. Undrafted out of college, he was the MVP of the independent Golden League in 2007, and signed with Boston.	With his mother and father watching from the back of the postgame interview room, Nava was asked about his climb to this moment.	"It's ridiculous," he said.	Only four players in big league history have hit grand slams in their first at-bat. Nava became the 10th player to homer in his first at-bat for the Red Sox, and just the second to hit a grand slam -- veteran Rip Repulski did it on May 10, 1960.	The 27-year-old Nava tried to approach his first plate appearance like another other one.	"I wanted to treat it like I normally do," he said. "I just said, 'How are you guys doing [to umpire Bill Hohn and catcher Brian Schneider]?' They didn't say anything."	As he rounded second base, it began to hit him, what he'd accomplished. Nava "started to scream. I was pumped."	Nava's slam brightened a rainy day that started out poorly for the Red Sox, even before the first pitch.	Daisuke Matsuzaka was a late scratch and placed on the 15-day disabled list with a strained forearm following his pregame throwing in the bullpen.	"When he was warming he said his forearm was sore," manager Terry Francona said. "He said he could pitch, but would have to change his delivery. We weren't comfortable with that."	Emergency starter Scott Atchison, recalled from Triple-A Pawtucket on Friday, worked three innings, allowing two runs and two hits in his first major league start.	Batting last in the order, Nava pulled the first pitch he saw into the Boston bullpen in right-center field, where reliever Manny Delcarmen made a leaping catch.	Nava got an enthusiastic greeting in the dugout, with Kevin Youkilis among those pounding him on the batting helmet. Encouraged by his teammates, Nava took a curtain call.	"I knew it was his first at-bat, but I tried to throw him a sinker away," Blanton said. "I threw it right down the middle and it didn't sink."	As luck would have it, Nava came up the next inning and again the bases loaded were loaded. With the crowd on its feet, Nava struck out on a check swing against Blanton.	Nava later hit a line-drive double into the left-center gap, and finished 2 for 4. Not a bad debut, considering it began on a shaky note -- he had a little trouble corraling Schneider's double down the left-field line in the top of the second.	The Red Sox pounded Blanton (1-5) for nine runs and 13 hits in four innings. But, he didn't fare as badly as Friday's starter, Jamie Moyer, who had the worst start in his 24 seasons, allowing nine runs and nine hits in one-plus inning.	J.D. Drew homered and had three hits for the Red Sox, who beat the Phillies 12-2 on the opener of a three-game series on Friday night.	Delcarmen (2-2), the second of five pitchers, worked two scoreless innings for the win.	Schneider had three hits and drove in both of Philadelphia's runs. The Phillies are 7-16 in their last 23 games.	Matsuzaka had warmed up and walked to the dugout about 15 minutes before the scheduled start.	Just ahead of the national anthem, Atchison started warming up quickly in the bullpen. When it was over, he completed his warmups before walking to the dugout with pitching coach John Farrell.	"This was happening quickly, with the anthem going on we were making pitching changes," Francona said.	The club announced the scratch and roster move just before the Red Sox took the field.	"It's a not a joint issue. It's muscle soreness, so I don't think it should take that long," Matsuzaka said through a translator.	Game notes	 Red Sox OF Josh Reddick was optioned to Pawtucket. ... Every Red Sox starter had a hit by the fourth inning. ... Blanton has allowed five or more runs in each of his last four starts. ... Youkilis was hit on the right arm by a pitch in the sixth inning and left the game the next inning."He's OK," Francona said. "He got it right on the funny bone."	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO -- The plan called for Mark Buehrle and the rest of the Chicago White Sox's rotation to dominate.	Who thought it would take this long to come to fruition?	Buehrle pitched scoreless ball into the seventh, Paul Konerko drove in two runs and the White Sox handed Carlos Silva his first loss, beating the struggling Cubs 2-1 Saturday for their season-high fourth straight win.	Konerko delivered a run-scoring single in the first and another in the seventh after Juan Pierre stole second, avoiding the tag with a neat dive. Konerko is 20 for 42 in his last 12 games.	The Cubs got a run-scoring single from Ryan Theriot off Bobby Jenks with two outs in the ninth, but Jenks struck out pinch-hitter Chad Tracy for his 11th save in 12 chances.	Buehrle (4-6), meanwhile, looked like his old self while sending the crosstown Cubs to their ninth loss in 12 games.	The solid outing by Buehrle capped a string of strong performances by a rotation that is finally starting to live up to the hype. White Sox starters have a 1.60 ERA over the past five games -- a big improvement for a group that started the week with an American League-worst 5.28 ERA.	"That's how we were supposed to be pitching," Buehrle said. "That's what we expected coming out of spring training."	The veteran left-hander allowed eight hits and struck out seven without a walk against an all right-handed lineup after going 1-6 with a 6.22 ERA in his previous 10 starts. He left to cheers from the White Sox fans after allowing back-to-back singles by Tyler Colvin and Theriot with two outs in the seventh.	Sergio Santos came in and struck out Tracy with a 97-mph fastball on the outside corner.	J.J. Putz pitched a scoreless eighth.	Jenks issued a leadoff walk in the ninth to Geovany Soto, who went to second on Kosuke Fukudome's chopper to the mound for the second out and came around on Theriot's single to right, but the White Sox hung on.	"We're getting the good pitching and timely hitting," Pierre said. "We dug ourselves such a hole that it's going to take one of these runs to get back in this thing. This is a big stretch for us."	Marlon Byrd had three hits for the Cubs, who fell eight games below .500 for the first time since they were 24-32 on June 5, 2007. They went on to win the first of two straight NL Central titles that year.	"It's very disappointing," Alfonso Soriano said. "We're not supposed to lose like we lost today."	Silva (8-1) allowed two runs and seven hits in seven innings while falling short in his bid to become the first Cubs starter to open a season 9-0 since Ken Holtzman in 1967. He set career highs with 123 pitches and two hit batters, and although he wasn't at his sharpest, he delivered another solid outing.	He allowed consecutive singles by Alexei Ramirez, Alex Rios and Konerko as the White Sox took a 1-0 lead in the first and left the bases loaded after hitting A.J. Pierzynski.	Pierre set up the White Sox's second run with a leadoff walk in the seventh and a spectacular dive to steal second on a pitchout.	The throw from Soto beat him by about six feet, but Pierre lifted his left arm and contorted his body to avoid shortstop Starlin Castro's tag before getting his hand on the bag.	With two outs, the Cubs decided to go after the surging Konerko rather than walk him to face Carlos Quentin, and he drove in Pierre with a single to right to make it 2-0.	As for the tag, Castro thought Pierre was out, but manager Lou Piniella said he won't get that call.	"He has a tendency to want to reach out instead of putting the ball or the glove on the bag where he can tag the runner," Piniella said. "He wants to reach. And the umpires, when they see you reach and then they see you reach again, they're not going to give you the call."	Game notes	 The Cubs will honor the Stanley Cup champion Blackhawks in a pregame ceremony on Sunday, with several players throwing out a ceremonial first pitch and leading the crowd in "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" during the seventh-inning stretch. Jim Cornelison will also sing the national anthem, as he does at Blackhawks games. Blackhawks president John McDonough was a longtime Cubs executive. ... White Sox infielder Omar Vizquel, who's tending to a family matter in Venezuela, might be back in time for Sunday's game.

BALTIMORE -- The streak lasted so long, the New York Mets found it laughable.	After going nearly 11 months without winning two straight on the road, the Mets finally broke though Saturday night by defeating the Baltimore Orioles 3-1.	Combined with their 5-1 win Friday, New York ended a drought that began after victories over Houston last July 25-26.	"It's embarrassing, it really is," said Jeff Francoeur, who homered to back a strong pitching performance by Hisanori Takahashi. "As a team, it's something we can laugh about, because we're playing well and we know what kind of team we have this year.	"It just kind of shows you how bad things were last year and how bad we've been on the road this year. It's almost hard to think that that's actually possible," he said. "I guess it is."	Jose Reyes also homered for the Mets, who are now assured of winning the three-game series after going 0-7-2 away from home -- their longest series drought to start a season since 1983.	"There is no doubt about it, that it's been a big issue, a big story," manager Jerry Manuel said. "To put that in the rearview mirror and keep playing is probably a confidence builder for the guys in the clubhouse. That they can win road games, that's huge."	Takahashi (5-2) gave up one run, six hits and a walk in seven innings. The rookie left-hander yielded a total of 11 runs in his previous two starts but had little difficulty against the AL's lowest-scoring team.	"We did a good job [Friday]," he said through an interpreter. "I just wanted to keep the flow going."	Pedro Feliciano worked the ninth and Francisco Rodriguez got three outs for his 13th save.	Orioles starter Brian Matusz (2-7) lost his seventh straight decision despite allowing only three runs and five hits in eight innings. The rookie right-hander was again victimized by a lack of offensive support -- in his last nine starts, Baltimore has scored only 11 runs while he was in the game.	Matusz took consolation in that he kept the light-hitting Orioles within striking distance.	"It's one of the best starts of my career," he said. "I didn't walk a guy today and I threw a lot of strikes. I made a couple mistake pitches with the solo home runs, but that's going to happen when you're throwing a lot of strikes. I was just attacking the zone today, and unfortunately came out with the loss."	Baltimore has lost 14 of 16 while being outscored 96-35. The Orioles are 0-9-1 in their last 10 series.	New York snapped a 1-1 tie in the sixth. With runners at the corners and one out, David Wright hit a comebacker. Matusz got the out at second, but the high relay from Julio Lugo pulled first baseman Ty Wigginton off the bag as Ruben Tejada scored from third.	"When you're in a funk those things happen. It seems like you don't make the play and it costs you," interim manager Juan Samuel said. "When things are going right, you don't make the plays and it does not cost you."	Francoeur homered leading off the eighth.	"That was nice -- a run to get to 3-1 and get us some breathing room," Francoeur said.	The Mets got off to a quick start behind Reyes, who hit the fifth pitch of the game into the left-field seats. It was his 15th career leadoff homer and New York's first this season.	Rookie Ike Davis then reached on a two-out error and stole second, but Matusz struck out Jason Bay.	Baltimore used doubles by Corey Patterson and Nick Markakis to pull even in the bottom half. But the Orioles would not get another runner past second base the rest of the game.	The Orioles went 1 for 10 with runners in scoring position after going 3 for 17 in that situation Friday.	Luke Scott took exception to a called third strike by Tom Hallion with a runner on first in the sixth, insisting the ball was outside. But that's how this season has been for Baltimore.	"The ball is in the other batter's box. You can't hit that. You can't even put it in play. You can't foul it off," he said. "Things like that have been happening to us consistently.

CLEVELAND -- The Carlos Santana Era in Cleveland is now in full swing.	Santana homered and drove in three runs in his second career game, powering Fausto Carmona and the Indians past the Washington Nationals 7-1 Saturday night.	Santana gave fans a peek at the future. With the teams wearing throwback uniforms, Carmona turned back the clock to 2007 -- when he went 19-8 as one of the game's most overpowering pitchers.	"That was our most dominant performance by a pitcher this season," Indians manager Manny Acta said. "Fausto was terrific and Carlos gave us a bit of a glimpse of what he can do."	Santana showed that Washington is not the only team with a rookie phenom. The rookie catcher got his first career hit one night before heralded pitcher Stephen Strasburg will make his first road start.	The 24-year-old switch-hitter had a two-run double off former Indians farmhand J.D. Martin (0-2), in a four-run second inning that put Cleveland ahead 5-0.	He then hit his first homer on a 1-1 pitch leading off the sixth, a drive into the right-field seats that made it 6-0.	Teammates completely ignored him when he got back to the dugout. Santana quietly sat down -- then was mobbed by players pounding his back in congratulations.	"That's part of the game," Santana said of the common practical joke in the majors, the ol' silent treatment. "I've seen it before. I was just very happy."	The Indians presented Santana with the baseballs he hit for his double and homer. He will give both to his mother.	Carmona (5-5) faced only 28 batters, one over the minimum. He twice induced double plays immediately after yielding a single.	"He threw 22 of 28 first-pitch strikes," Acta said. "He had a great changeup. It was a terrific performance."	Carmona gave up three hits and one run in his second complete game of the year to win for the first time in six starts. He struck out seven without a walk as Cleveland won its fourth straight for the first time since April 15-18. The Nationals fell to 4-14 on the road since May 13.	"I don't want to show any disrespect for anyone else, but I don't know that anyone has pitched a better game against us this year," Nationals manager Jim Riggleman said. "Nothing comes to mind, really."	Ryan Zimmerman ruined Carmona's shutout bid with his 13th homer to open the eighth.	Russell Branyan homered in the bottom half to make it 7-1.	Carmona credited Santana, whose reputation is that of a hitter in need of work behind the plate. He switched from playing infield to catcher only three years ago.	"I didn't shake him off once," Carmona said. "I was very confident in him."	Acta thanked the coaching staff at Triple-A Columbus for preparing Santana for the majors.	"He's nowhere near what he looked like in spring training," Acta said. "He did a tremendous job calling the game."	Cleveland scored an unearned run without a hit in the first. Shin-Soo Choo was hit by a pitch, went to third on a throwing error by second baseman Adam Kennedy, and scored on a sacrifice fly by Travis Hafner.	Luis Valbuena had a sacrifice fly and Choo an RBI single in the second. Santana then hit a sharp grounder past first baseman Adam Dunn to make it 4-0.	"The ball really jumps off his bat," Riggleman said. "They've got a special guy there."	The teams wore uniforms from each city's first World Series championships, the 1920 Indians and 1924 Nationals, also called the Senators. Cleveland's uniforms sported the black armband that was worn 90 years ago after Ray Chapman died one day after being hit by a pitch by Carl Mays of the New York Yankees that season.	On Sunday, fans will get a glimpse of the future: Santana vs. Strasburg.	Strasburg struck out 14 over seven innings in his debut Tuesday night against Pittsburgh.	Santana, acquired in a July 2008 trade from the Los Angeles Dodgers for veteran Casey Blake, hit .316 with 13 homers and 51 RBIs in 57 games at Columbus before his callup Friday.	Game notes	 Indians OF Trevor Crowe left with a right knee contusion. He fouled a ball off the knee. ... Nationals C Ivan Rodriguez, 3 for 9 with two homers in his career against Carmona, didn't play. He had started three of four games and gone 5 for 11 since being activated Tuesday after missing 14 games with a strained back. Rodriguez caught Strasburg's debut and will catch him again Sunday. ... Cleveland signed INF Aaron Fields, its 42nd-round draft pick. He is the son of the team's hitting coordinator Bruce Fields, a former big league catcher.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DETROIT -- Carlos Guillen was thinking he'd have a hard time running around bases. As it turned out, he didn't need any speed at all.	Guillen led off the 10th inning with a home run Saturday night, giving the Detroit Tigers a 4-3 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates.	"My calf started cramping in the first inning, and as the game went on, it was getting tighter," he said. "I finished the game, but I'll have to see how I feel tomorrow."	Guillen hit the third pitch from Brendan Donnelly (2-1) into the right-field stands, sending the Pirates to their seventh straight loss.	"I think it was a cutter inside, and with a 2-0 count, I was trying to drive the ball," Guillen said. "When I hit it, I knew it was gone."	Guillen took his time on the home-run trot. Keeping Kendry Morales' grand-slam broken leg in mind, kept his teammates from getting too vigorous with the celebration at the plate.	"We've got to learn to keep people healthy there," he said. "You have to celebrate, but in the right way."	If Guillen's ball had hit the wall, it would have still been the end of his night.	"If he got a hit, I was going to pinch-run for him," Tigers manager Jim Leyland said. "It worked out pretty good -- that's the best way to get games over with in a hurry."	The Pirates matched their longest skid of the season. Leyland didn't want his current team to let down against the franchise he managed from 1986-1996.	"That doesn't matter -- that's still a good major league team," Leyland said. "They've got one of the best young players in baseball in [Andrew] McCutchen, and some good, young athletes."	Phil Coke (4-0) got the win with a scoreless 10th.	The Pirates made it 3-all in the eighth when Jose Tabata stretched what looked like a routine one-out single into a double as center fielder Austin Jackson didn't react quickly enough. Tabata stole third and scored the tying run on Neil Walker's single through a drawn-in infield.	"That's just great effort by Jose," Pittsburgh manager John Russell said. "When you are playing like this, you have to make your own breaks, and that's what Jose did -- he created a run by being aggressive on the bases."	The Tigers put runners on second and third with two outs in the ninth, but Brennan Boesch struck out.	Pittsburgh got a run in the second on Ryan Church's RBI double, and still had the bases loaded with one out, but Jason Jaramillo bounced into a 1-6-3 double play.	The Tigers tied the game in the bottom half on an unusual double play. With the bases loaded and no one out, Gerald Laird flied out to the wall in right-center field. Boesch scored from third, but Guillen was thrown out trying to take third.	Garrett Jones made it 2-1 with a long homer in the fourth. Ryan Doumit nearly gave the Pirates back-to-back homers, but the umpires ruled that a fan had reached into the field of play to catch the ball, and held him at second.	The Tigers loaded the bases in the fifth, but Guillen grounded into an inning-ending double play.	Detroit took the lead in the seventh. With two runners on and two out, reliever Evan Meek made a nice play on Boesch's slow grounder, but Doumit missed the throw at first base for an error and the ball rolled down the right-field line as two runs scored.	Doumit, normally a catcher, was playing first base for just the third time this season.	"The first thing they teach you when you start playing baseball as a kid is to keep your eye on the ball, and I didn't do that," he said. "It's tough trying to learn a new position at this level, under the microscope, but I have to make that play. It was a perfect throw."	Game notes	 For Detroit's 16th annual Negro Leagues tribute game, the teams wore the uniforms of the Detroit Stars and Pittsburgh Crawfords. ... Jackson's seventh-inning single ended Meek's six-game streak without allowing a hit. ... The Tigers have gone 31-6 in interleague games at Comerica Park since May 20, 2006. ... Jose Valverde struck out the side in the ninth, extending his scoreless streak to 25 games and 25 1/3 innings. ... Donnelly had won eight straight decisions since May 1, 2007.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MILWAUKEE -- Chris Ray started throwing curveballs in games about a month ago after playing with the pitch with teammate Darren Oliver.	Ray's rare offering saved Texas' bullpen from a big meltdown.	The former Baltimore closer saved his first game since 2007 by getting Prince Fielder to pop up after the other relievers nearly blew Scott Feldman's six scoreless innings in Texas' 4-3 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers on Saturday night.	"I've been working it in a good bit lately, it's good against lefties," said Ray, who isn't sure the pitch is on scouting reports yet. "The ball's not moving towards them. It's a good difference off the speed of my fastball. It's a good pitch to get guys off-balance."	It was also effective just in time to get the Rangers out of a giant jam.	Ray came in with one out and the bases loaded after closer Neftali Feliz allowed an RBI single to Rickie Weeks that made it 4-2. He got NL home run leader Corey Hart to hit into a run-scoring fielder's choice before forcing Fielder to pop out to left field on a full-count fastball to finish 0 for 5.	"The guy can hit fastballs, he's proven that," Ray said. "I tried to get ahead of him, really didn't do it. I had to give him his fastball. It looked like he was right on it, fouled it straight back.	"That's when I started throwing the curveball. Then I thought after I slowed him down a little bit, I'd be able to beat his bat a little bit with the fastball."	Josh Hamilton hit his 14th homer of the season and Feldman (4-6) left with a 4-0 lead, looking closer to the 17-game winner he was last season than the player who had given up three runs or more in six of his previous seven starts.	Oliver pitched a scoreless seventh, Frank Francisco allowed an RBI double to Ryan Braun in the eighth and it looked as if the Brewers might rally off Feliz in the ninth.	Instead, Ray saved his first game since July 15, 2007. He had reconstructive elbow surgery the next month and hadn't been back in a closer's role since.	"Last year it was rough, the whole season I had a problem with mechanics and trying to find my arm slot," Ray said. "This year, finally, I can go out there and pitch without having to think about mechanics."	Justin Smoak's two-run double in the first and Hamilton's sixth-inning shot off Brewers starter Manny Parra (1-4) gave Texas a 3-0 lead. Hamilton extended his hitting streak to nine, picking up the offense with Vladimir Guerrero sitting out every other game of this interleague trip.	David Murphy's RBI single in the eighth off reliever Chris Capuano made it 4-0.	Feldman had gone 17 starts without a scoreless appearance and escaped big jams in the first and second innings that started because of his questionable command. He hit Weeks with a pitch, walked three and plunked home plate umpire Gary Cederstrom twice with pitches in consecutive innings when catcher Matt Treanor couldn't handle the throws.	"I kept hitting him. I felt bad, I was like, 'Please don't hold that against me,'" Feldman said. "I got crossed up with Matty there. I threw a changeup and he was expecting a curveball.	"I was finding all ways to hit him."	All that may have played into his favor after he settled down.	The Brewers looked uncomfortable against him. Feldman struck out a season-high six, including Fielder and Jim Edmonds twice.	"He threw really well," Hart said. "We looked at some of his previous starts, and his curveball wasn't nearly as effective as it was tonight."	Milwaukee is 4-17 when failing to hit a home run. Hart, Fielder, Braun and Casey McGehee finished 2 of 17 with five strikeouts after all four had homered the night before.	The Rangers sat Guerrero and his majors-leading 54 RBIs because manager Ron Washington wants to limit his innings in the outfield on this nine-game trip.	And while it appeared there would be a big hole in the lineup, Smoak and Hamilton gave the Rangers enough runs to rebound from a 6-2 loss in Friday's opener after scoring 31 in their previous three games, all wins.	"Our lineup is really dangerous when we can get everyone one through nine working," said Michael Young, who is two hits away from tying Ivan Rodriguez's franchise record with 1,747. "When the bottom third of our lineup gets going, we have a chance to be a pretty dynamic offense."	Game notes	 Pinch hitter Julio Borbon extended his hitting streak to 10 when he beat out a bunt in the ninth. ... Weeks got his 500th career hit with a double in the fifth. ... Rangers RHP Rich Harden (strained left gluteus muscle) went on the 15-day disabled list. ... Milwaukee sends ace RHP Yovani Gallardo (6-2, 2.41 ERA) to face RHP Colby Lewis (5-4, 3.40) in the series finale Sunday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MINNEAPOLIS -- Bobby Cox and the Atlanta Braves needed a run in the ninth inning, so they turned to Brooks Conrad for the squeeze bunt.	In his final season in the dugout, Cox is still managing that National League style to the end.	Conrad filled in capably for Chipper Jones on Saturday night, making two tricky plays at third base and driving in two runs for the Braves in a 3-2 victory over the Minnesota Twins.	The squeeze by Conrad provided a fitting finish to another crisp, close game between these interleague foes.	"That's National League baseball at its finest," Braves starting pitcher Derek Lowe said.	Conrad also hit an RBI double. Cox put him in the lineup about a half-hour before the game for Jones, who missed five games last week with inflammation in his right ring finger and had the injury flare up.	Matt Guerrier (1-2) walked Gregor Blanco on four straight fastballs with one out in the Atlanta ninth, the majors-leading 292nd walk drawn by the Braves this year. Then Martin Prado's perfect execution of a hit-and-run single put runners at the corners. Jose Mijares entered the game, and Conrad dropped down a textbook bunt that the Twins reliever picked up and bobbled but had no play.	"It was a tough pitch, too, but Conrad can do it," Cox said. "We've got to try to win somehow. Brooksie, I know, is going to get the sign. There's no problem there. ... You just have to guess."	Conrad has only 45 at-bats in 40 games this year. He twice made difficult off-balance throws to get the Twins on grounders down the line, and his two-out double against Nick Blackburn in the fifth put the Braves ahead 2-1.	"That's part of this role. You have to be ready when they call on you," he said.	Billy Wagner got the save in the bottom of the inning, his 11th in 13 attempts this season after stranding a runner at first base, the eighth of the night for the Twins.	Buoyed by a strikeout-caught-stealing double play to end the sixth after Joe Mauer's RBI double tied the game at 2, Lowe lasted one out into the eighth but took his first no-decision. The Twins loaded the bases, but Jason Kubel -- a career .400 hitter with the bags full -- struck out against the fourth pitcher of the inning, Jonny Venters (2-0).	"We missed a couple of executing situations, and they got 'em," Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said.	The Twins held their annual charity auction and autograph party at Target Field on a gray, wet afternoon, with some fans arriving before sunrise to stake a place in line for the most popular players.	The weather didn't get any better for the game, which started on time despite persistent rain, but the crowd of 40,001 still streamed in for the team's 29th straight sellout.	More people used the standing-room space around the lower concourse than usual to stay dry, but the number of ponchos and umbrellas spotted in the seats proved yet again this state's appetite for outdoor baseball after nearly three decades at the Metrodome.	Fresh from Francisco Liriano's 11-strikeout masterpiece on Friday, the Twins looked to Blackburn to build on that -- and get back on track after two bad turns to begin the month. The right-hander went 5-0 with a 2.65 ERA in five May starts, but his first two June appearances were ugly with five runs and 10 hits apiece and only 19 outs -- none swinging.	Blackburn left a changeup for Melky Cabrera to drive into the right-field seats, and the back-to-back doubles later in the fifth by Prado and Conrad were hit especially hard. But Blackburn finished seven innings with only two runs across and struck out a season-high five, giving him 22 for the year. The epitome of a pitch-to-contact sinkerballer, Blackburn's strikeout rate -- roughly one per two innings for his career -- was about one per four innings entering the game.	He mixed in his curveball well and refined his fluid motion to the plate.	"I think the mechanics are just where they should be right now, and hopefully they can stay that way," Blackburn said, adding: "It's usually quite a battle to get 'em back."	Game notes	 This is Atlanta's third visit to Minnesota, but in 14 years of interleague play the Twins have never traveled to Turner Field. ... Blanco was in the starting lineup for the first time this season. ... Twins 2B Orlando Hudson tested his sore left wrist by swinging in the batting cage before the game and told Gardenhire he'll be ready to come off the DL on Tuesday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

CINCINNATI -- Call it a plus-three night for Jonny Gomes.	Gomes misjudged a three-run double in the field, but hit three-run homers in his first two at-bats for a career-high six RBIs, powering the Cincinnati Reds to an 11-5 win over the Kansas City Royals on Saturday.	"This game will drive you crazy with its ups and downs," said the Reds left fielder, whose six RBIs were a Cincinnati season high. "A win like this and an individual night like that will put a smile on your face. It makes it all worth it."	Brandon Phillips had three hits, including his eighth homer of the season, to extend his hitting streak to 15 games -- Cincinnati's longest of the season and the longest current streak in the majors. The Reds overcame another shaky start by Johnny Cueto to snap a four-game losing streak against Kansas City.	Cueto (6-1), who tied his career high twice by allowing 10 hits in each of his last two outings, shook off a rocky second inning to last six, allowing five runs on five hits and four walks. The right-hander struck out six and retired 11 of the last 12 batters he faced.	"I felt strong, and I was trying to throw too hard," Cueto said. "[Pitching coach] Bryan Price told me in the clubhouse to relax. I was overthrowing and opening up."	Right-hander Brian Bannister (6-4) was pounded for 11 runs -- 10 earned -- on 10 hits with two walks and two strikeouts while seeing his personal five-start winning streak snapped. Bannister said he made the mistake of trying to pitch in the humid, 86-degree weather on an empty stomach.	"I was struggling physically," he said. "I like pitching on an empty stomach, and I was trying to get liquids in me, but I was feeling a little faint in the third inning."	It showed in his control, manager Ned Yost said.	"He was over the plate," Yost said. "When he's on, he works the corners, in and out."	The Reds scored four runs in the first, the first on Phillips' eighth home run of the season and the other three on Gomes' eighth homer of the season.	The Royals bounced right back with five runs in the second, one on Bannister's double to right-center field and three on David DeJesus' bases-loaded double to left field that sailed over Gomes' head after he initially took a step toward the infield.	Gomes gave the Reds a 7-5 lead in the third with his second homer of the game and 12th of his career against the Royals, more than he's hit against any other team. The eighth multihomer game of his career prompted the crowd to cheer for a curtain call.	"The fans here, especially in left field, have really taken to my style of play," he said.	Gomes now has a team-high 47 RBI, four short of the 51 he drove in all of last season and 12 shy of tying the career high he set with Tampa Bay in 2006. Manager Dusty Baker will take every one of them.	"That's what we talk about all the time," Baker said. "The name of the game is the team that touches home plate the most wins."	Gomes was hit by pitches his next two times at the plate, and Royals reliever Dusty Hughes hit pinch-hitters Chris Heisey and Paul Janish with pitches in the seventh, tying a franchise record for the most times hit by pitches in a game.	According to STATS, LLC, the Reds were hit by pitches four times in a game for the first time since Sept. 5, 1965, against Philadelphia.	Phillips singled during Cincinnati's three-run fourth inning. He's hitting .462 (31 for 67) during his hitting streak, including 9 for 14 over his last three games.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- His confidence seemingly growing with every at-bat, Carlos Pena is emerging from a seasonlong slump with flair.	The suddenly red-hot slugger homered for the sixth consecutive game, helping right-hander Matt Garza and the Tampa Bay Rays beat the Florida Marlins 6-5 on Saturday night.	"I keep saying I'm just grateful I have an opportunity to do it," said Pena, whose .196 batting average is his highest in more than a month. "That is awesome, so I never lose sight of that."	The 2009 AL home run co-champion became the first player to go deep in six straight games since Frank Thomas did it for Oakland Sept. 5-11, 2006. He has seven homers during the streak, giving him 15 this season and a league-leading 131 since joining the Rays in 2007 -- four more than Alex Rodriguez.	The major league record of eight consecutive games with a homer is shared by Dale Long (Pirates, May 19-28, 1956), Don Mattingly (Yankees, July 8-18, 1987) and Ken Griffey, Jr. (Mariners, July 20-28, 1993).	"I'm trusting myself a little bit more. I'm trusting my plan, and I'm focusing on seeing the ball and trusting that the right swing will come out when my eyes recognize the pitch I want," Pena said, adding that he isn't going to the plate looking to hit home runs.	"When you try, it doesn't happen. So, I've been focusing on the process and executing the process. ... Everything else just takes care of itself."	Pena connected off right-hander Ricky Nolasco (5-5) in the first inning for a 2-1 lead. Carl Crawford and Sean Rodrgiuez also homered for the Rays, who maintained baseball's best record (40-22) and a one-game lead over the Yankees in the AL East.	"I'm not going to say anything. ... He can just keep doing what he's doing," Garza said. "I don't care how he's doing it, but keep doing what he's doing."	Garza (7-4) allowed four runs and nine hits in 5 2/3 innings. Relievers Grant Balfour and Joaquin Benoit got the Rays to the ninth inning, where Rafael Soriano sat the Marlins down in order to earn his 16th save in 16 opportunities.	Evan Longoria, Ben Zobrist and Reid Brignac also drove in runs for Tampa Bay, which rebounded from losing the opener of the Citrus Series 14-9. The Rays have won 11 of 14 games against the Marlins over the past two-plus seasons.	A night after drawing a crowd of just 19,338, attendance jumped to 29,963 -- bolstered by a postgame concert featuring country music performer Dierks Bentley.	All three of Tampa Bay's homers were solo shots off Nolasco, who allowed five runs and nine hits over 2 1/3 innings.	"I think tonight is just one of those games," Florida manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "I'm going to chalk it up to just one of those games and go from there."	The Marlins trailed 5-1 when Nolasco departed and wasted a couple of opportunities to cut into the deficit.	Hanley Ramirez tripled in the third, but was thrown out trying to score on a fly ball that right fielder Zobrist caught in foul territory. Dan Uggla and Cody Ross singled to begin the fourth, but Ross was thrown out trying to stretch his hit into a double.	Two batters later, Helms hit his first homer since Sept. 2, trimming Garza's lead to 5-3. The Marlins scored the final run off the Rays starter, who walked two and struck out seven, when Ramirez grounded into a double play in the fifth.	Game notes	Jose Canseco homered in five consecutive games for Tampa Bay in 1999. ... Marlins LF Chris Coughlan tripled in the first inning, extending his hitting streak to 12 games. ... The Rays placed OF Gabe Kapler on the 15-day disabled list with a right hip flexor strain and recalled OF Justin Ruggiano from Triple-A Durham. ... SS Jason Bartlett, out since May 30 with right hamstring strain, will begin a two-game minor league rehab stint with Durham on Monday. He's expected to return to Tampa Bay's lineup Wednesday at Atlanta.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

DENVER -- Jason Hammel is proving he's a solid second act to Ubaldo Jimenez.	Hammel pitched eight sharp innings and scored the only run and the Colorado Rockies beat the Toronto Blue Jays 1-0 Saturday night in a rare low-scoring game at Coors Field.	It was only the ninth 1-0 game at Denver since the ballpark opened in 1995. The previous one came last July 6 when the Rockies beat Washington. The Rockies are 6-3 in 1-0 games at Coors Field.	"If you're going to win 1-0 there's no room for error," Rockies manager Jim Tracy said. "From the pitching and defense side, there was no error. We were perfect."	Pitching in 50-degree weather, Hammel (4-3) was masterful all night. He allowed just three hits, struck out six and walked three in his longest outing of the season. He is 4-1 with a 2.41 ERA since coming off the disabled list May 15 with a strained right groin.	"I'm happy for him," catcher Miguel Olivo said. "He's got all the pitches working. We used all of them today."	Hammel has come on strong after starting the season 0-2 with a 9.16 ERA in his first four starts.	"This is the Jason Hammel we had for the entire spring training," Tracy said. "It's really good to see. He's got great stuff and tonight his slider was terrific and his fastball command to both sides of the plate was terrific."	Hammel's last six starts have followed Jimenez, who leads the majors with 12 wins and a 1.16 ERA. Pitching behind the team ace has energized Hammel.	"When one guy goes out and pitches really well, obviously you want to follow with a good outing yourself," he said. "That's how momentum builds and teams go on winning streaks."	Hammel provided the lone run in the sixth. He led off with a walk, went to third on Todd Helton's one-out single and scored on a sacrifice fly by Carlos Gonzalez.	"I've got to do everything here," Hammel said with a laugh.	Manuel Corpas worked around a hit in the ninth for his eighth saves in 10 chances.	Fred Lewis had a double and walked twice for the Blue Jays.	The Rockies threatened again in the seventh. Olivo led off with a double down the left-field line to finish Toronto starter Brandon Morrow (4-5). Reliever David Purcey retired Ian Stewart on a popup and intentionally walked Clint Barmes. After Hammel put down a successful sacrifice bunt, Jonathan Herrera grounded out.	Morrow allowed five hits, walked three and struck out six.	"He did everything he could," Toronto manager Cito Gaston said. "The only mistake he made was walking the pitcher. He had no run support."	Hammel had a lot to do with that. Lewis was the only runner to reach third and the Rockies pitchers held the Blue Jays to four hits.	"We're a better hitting team than this," first baseman Lyle Overbay said. "I think their staff is learning how to pitch here. You don't see many sliders or curveballs here and when you do, they are breaking a lot."	Both teams had chances to score early. Lewis opened the game with a double off Ryan Spilborghs' glove in left field but was stranded at third when Vernon Wells popped out to first to end the inning.	Hammel said the tape around his right groin bothered him in the first inning, but after getting out of the jam he was able to get the leg rewrapped and settled down.	Helton doubled to lead off the fourth, just missing a home run when his ball bounced off the top of the right-center field wall and back into play. Helton was cut down at third trying to advance on Gonzalez's groundout.	Game notes	 Rockies SS Troy Tulowitzki was scratched from the lineup with a sore right groin. ... Colorado has eight shutouts as a team this season. ... The Rockies agreed to terms with 11 players they selected in the 2010 draft, including 1B Mark Tracy, son of Colorado manager Jim Tracy.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PHOENIX -- Dan Haren told teammate Mark Reynolds before the game that "he had it tonight."	Then the Arizona right-hander went out and proved it against one of the best-hitting teams in baseball, striking out nine without a walk in the Diamondbacks 7-2 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals on Saturday night.	"He's tough," St. Louis manager Tony La Russa said, "made us look foolish a lot. He's got nasty stuff."	Haren (7-4) gave up two runs on six hits to improve to 4-0 in four career starts against the Cardinals, the first team he pitched for in the majors back in 2003-04.	"There's a handful of games every year where you've got everything working, where you've got all your pitches and feel good," Haren said, "and this was one of them."	He faced just one three-ball count and threw first-pitch strikes to 25 of 30 batters in a game that lasted just 2 hours, 28 minutes. Pitching on his own bobblehead night, Haren also singled twice in three at-bats to boost his season's batting average to .425.	"I hope this is a sign of many of these to come," Arizona manager A.J. Hinch said, "because he can get locked in and stay that way for a while."	Adam LaRoche had two of the Diamondbacks' four solo home runs. Reynolds had three hits, including an RBI double and his 15th home run of the season. Chris Snyder also homered for Arizona. Colby Rasmus had a solo home run for St. Louis.	Three of Arizona's homers came against Adam Ottavino (0-2), making his third major league start. Ottavino lasted just 3 2/3 innings, allowing six runs on nine hits.	"He had too many balls in the hot zone, the middle of the plate," La Russa said. "He gave them a lot of pitches to hit and they got 'em."	Haren retired the first 12 batters, four on strikeouts, before Matt Holliday doubled down the left field line to lead off the fifth. Ryan Ludwick followed with an RBI single up the middle to make it 6-1. The Cardinals went on to load the bases with one out on singles by Yadier Molina and Brendan Ryan. Haren, though, got pinch-hitter Felipe Lopez and David Freese to pop out to end the inning.	"If you don't take advantage of him and let him feel comfortable out there, he's going to get comfortable and pitch seven, eight, nine innings, and that's what happened, Albert Pujols, who was 0 for 3 and struck out once.	Rasmus led off the sixth with a home run. Haren retired the next eight before Rasmus singled with one out in the eighth.	In the first, Stephen Drew drew a two-out walk, advanced to second on a wild pitch, then scored when Reynolds doubled.	Reynolds and LaRoche hit consecutive two-out home runs to almost the exact same spot in the left-center seats. Snyder homered in the fourth, then Kelly Johnson and Drew had RBI doubles.	LaRoche led off the fifth with his second home run of the night. He has homered twice in a game three times this season, accounting for six of his nine home runs.	"It's not totally unusual for me to have them come in bunches," LaRoche said, "normally not in the same game like it is this year. But I'm starting to feel better. It started three days ago, I kind of tweaked some things in my stance to try to get in better position to drive the ball. Right now it's going pretty good."	Hinch noted that one of LaRoche's homers went to the opposite field, an indication of how well the first baseman is swinging. LaRoche agreed.	"When I'm driving the ball the other way, and I think it's very typical of all of us hitters, that's when you're in a good position to hit," he said, "That's what I want to get back to doing a little more often.'"	Game notes	 Arizona activated C Miguel Montero and optioned C John Hester to Triple-A Reno. Montero has been sidelined with a sprained knee since April 11. ... RHP Jeff Suppan, who threw a bullpen session before the game, is expected to sign with the Cardinals and start Tuesday against Seattle. ... On an unseasonably cool day, the roof of Chase Field was open. ... Slumping Arizona RF Justin Upton, 6 for 31 in the home stand and the major league leader with 87 strikeouts, was dropped to seventh in the batting order. He was 0 for 4 with two strikeouts. ... Ottavino's first two career starts were nationally televised Saturday games.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN DIEGO -- When Adrian Gonzalez launched a two-run homer off Cliff Lee in the first inning, all of the San Diego Padres got a lift.	Gonzalez's shot and a strong outing from starter Wade LeBlanc helped the Padres to a 7-1 win over Seattle on Saturday night, the Mariners' fifth straight loss.	The home run by the streaking Gonzalez came after LeBlanc escaped a bases-loaded, no-out jam in the top of the first.	"I think everybody in this stadium can sense a shift after Gonzo's homer," LeBlanc said. "It's huge, especially against a guy like Cliff Lee. If you can get some early runs, get to him early because once he settles down, it's tough."	Lee (4-3) proved that by retiring the final 11 batters he faced.	But LeBlanc (4-4) provided his club with a big boost in the first by first getting Jose Lopez to ground into a third-to-home-to-first double play. After intentionally walking a batter to load the bases again, the left-hander retired Josh Wilson on a fly ball.	"That was huge," Gonzalez said. "It just picks you up, especially in the first inning. Everyone is trying to get into the groove of the game and something like that just gets you going."	Said LeBlanc: "That's not the ideal way you want to start off the game but that's the way it happened. Fortunately, everything worked out."	Oscar Salazar added a pinch-hit three-run shot, his first home run of the season, to break open the game in the eighth.	It added up to Seattle's eighth loss in nine games. It also led to a Mariners' players-only meeting after the game.	"We have to turn it around," Lee said. "It's about time to snap out of it, but it is what it is. We've got to do a better job of executing, and that's everybody."	The Mariners tied their season high by stranding 12 runners. Seattle also loaded the bases with one out in the eighth off Mike Adams. But Adams retired consecutive pinch-hitters, striking out Michael Saunders and getting Casey Kotchman on a grounder.	"That's two nights in a row that we've had a pretty good starting pitching performance and our offense has squandered it," Seattle manager Don Wakamatsu said. "We came out of the gate early and aren't able to score. With Cliff Lee on the mound and the way he's been pitching, it's a totally different ball game."	Over his last 13 games, Gonzalez is batting .412 (21 for 51) with five homers, 15 RBIs and 10 runs scored. He is 7 for 9 against Lee, including seven straight hits.	Gonzalez's first-inning home run was only the second surrendered by Lee this season.	"I got behind 2-0 there and threw a cutter and he hit it out," Lee said. "He's a great hitter. For whatever reason, I've had trouble against him."	LeBlanc pitched his second strong game after a four-game losing streak. The lefty got through six innings, allowing one run on seven hits and stranding eight baserunners.	Lee gave up three runs and seven hits in seven innings.	With the win, the Padres clinched the season series over Seattle for the first time since 2004.	"We lost another game and the frustration is really growing even more at this point," Wilson said. "We've got to do something to break it."	Gonzalez's homer was his 14th this season, but just five have come at Petco Park.	Ichiro Suzuki got the Mariners on the board in the second when he hit a bloop single to score Rob Johnson, who had doubled.	Game notes	 Salazar has five career pinch-hit homers. ... Lee had worked at least eight innings in his previous three straight starts, including a complete-game win in his last start. ... San Diego won its second straight interleague home game after having lost 12 of their previous 14 coming into the series. ... Seattle LHP Luke French, recalled from Triple-A Tacoma on Sunday, will replace struggling RHP Ian Snell in the starting rotation. ... Padres bench coach Ted Simmons was the interim manager while Bud Black attended his daughter's graduation on Saturday from Oregon State.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Barry Zito had his closer to thank for preserving a long-awaited victory against the Oakland Athletics.	"That was all about Brian Wilson," Zito said. "He stole the show."	Zito finally got the best of his former team and only club he'd never beaten, ending a four-start winless stretch in the San Francisco Giants' 5-4 victory over the A's on Saturday night.	Pablo Sandoval homered, Juan Uribe hit a pair of run-scoring singles and Aubrey Huff added an RBI triple for the Giants. They made it two in a row in the Bay Bridge Series after being swept across the bay in Oakland last month.	While Zito gave up solo home runs to Adam Rosales and Matt Carson, he outpitched Ben Sheets (2-6). Wilson earned a five-out save, pitching out of two jams.	"That's what I signed up for," Wilson said. "You get a chance to be a hero or a failure. I always like to choose the hero option because it's more lucrative. Fans like it."	Zito (7-2) was the 2002 AL Cy Young Award winner with the A's and left for a $126 million, seven-year deal with the Giants before the 2007 season. It took him five tries to beat Oakland after going 0-4 with an 8.85 ERA over his first four outings.	Zito lost to the A's 6-1 on May 21 at the Coliseum -- tagged for season highs of nine hits and six runs -- and had three straight no-decisions since then.	"It's definitely a monkey off my back," said Zito, who credited the A's for tough at-bats against him each matchup. "It was different the first year over here. Since then they've been getting me on off days."	This time, he allowed two runs on six hits in seven innings, struck out six and walked two. He won on an unseasonably warm Bay Area night featuring a first-pitch temperature of 73 degrees, highest all season at AT&T Park.	The Giants nearly lost their lead in the eighth after the A's loaded the bases against former Oakland reliever Santiago Casilla. Jeremy Affeldt relieved and walked pinch-hitter Gabe Gross to force in a run that made it 5-4.	Wilson entered and got the final two outs of the eighth, then finished for his 17th save in 19 chances after allowing two singles.	Perhaps this win will help get Zito on a roll like the left-hander was on when he began the season 5-0. Zito, who beat out an infield single in the fourth for his fifth hit of the year, improved to 11-17 in interleague play.	Wilson was happy to get Zito back in the win column -- against the A's, no less.	"We were aware of that," Wilson said of Zito not beating Oakland. "I was thinking of getting a little beer shower going, but he's got 10 years in."	Oakland's Kevin Kouzmanoff singled in the first to extend his career-high hitting streak to 13 games and added an RBI double in the eighth.	Sheets, on a $10 million, one-year contract, lost his third straight start and is winless over seven outings since beating Tampa Bay on May 8. He was done after six innings for the third straight time.	"Six innings isn't that great," Sheets said. "That's where I am right now. I'm starting to feel better toward the end of games so I'll just keep pushing forward. It's a long season."	Sandoval led off the sixth with his fifth home run of the year and first in 58 at-bats since his last on May 28.	Andres Torres hit a go-ahead RBI single in the second, an unearned run after Sheets' throwing error allowed Sandoval to advance after he drew a leadoff walk.	A's manager Bob Geren rejoined the team after missing Friday night's 6-2 loss to attend the high school graduation of his son, Bobby.	"To come up short was a little disheartening but it was a great comeback," Geren said.	Also, center fielder and leadoff man Rajai Davis returned to Oakland's lineup after missing four games since his left hamstring tightened up on a triple Monday night against the Angels.	Game notes	 Kouzmanoff is batting .451 with 10 RBIs during the hitting streak. ... With an off-day Monday, Geren is leaning toward giving both Sheets and Dallas Braden -- winless in six starts since his perfect game May 9 -- an extra day or two between starts. ...

LOS ANGELES -- Scott Kazmir gave up two runs in the fifth inning, then turned things over to the Los Angeles Angels' bullpen. The relievers didn't let him down.	Four pitchers combined to shut out the Dodgers over the final four innings, Juan Rivera hit a two-run homer and the surging Angels won 4-2 Saturday night for their ninth win in 11 games.	"To get four zeros up is important to us, especially when Kazmir didn't get quite as deep in the game as we'd like," manager Mike Scioscia said. "He battled and he set a tone early that he was going to challenge guys."	The Angels improved to 11-3 since losing leading hitter Kendry Morales to a season-ending broken left leg on May 29. They can complete a Freeway Series sweep with a victory in Sunday's finale.	The Angels are 10-3 on their road trip, the first time they've posted 10 wins on a trip since July 17-26, 1964, at Minnesota, Chicago and Kansas City.	"It's a two-week stretch, but we felt we were starting to click so it was our objective to win every game," Kazmir said. "We knew it was going to turn around for us sooner or later. We believe in ourselves and it's starting to show."	Kazmir (6-5) allowed two runs and three hits in five innings, struck out five and walked four in winning for the fourth time in his last five games.	Brian Fuentes pitched the ninth to earn his ninth save in 12 chances. The Dodgers had the tying run at the plate with two outs, but Russell Martin struck out swinging to end the game.	John Ely (3-3) gave up four runs and six hits in five innings, struck out two and walked three to end his two-game winning streak.	"I've got to do a better job than I did," he said. "Four runs in five innings isn't cutting it. We're capable of beating that team, and I think everybody knows that."	Ely has a 7.20 ERA in his last two starts after going 3-1 with a 1.80 ERA in his previous six starts.	"He's just been a little off. When he's going to be successful, his control has to be perfect," Dodgers manager Joe Torre said. "He's either on the edges [of the plate] or off the edges, because that's what he's all about. He can't challenge people over the middle because he's not overpowering."	For the second straight game, the Angels' rotation kept the Dodgers' big hitters in check. Andre Ethier, Matt Kemp and James Loney were a combined 0 for 11. That trio, along with Manny Ramirez, went 1 for 15 on Friday night, when the Dodgers lost 10-1. Ramirez popped up to short as a pinch-hitter in the ninth.	"He's fighting it right now," Torre said about Kemp. "It looks like he's jumping a little at the plate, and he certainly is frustrated."	The Dodgers are hitting .159 and are 1 for 14 with runners in scoring position in the first two games against the Angels.	Trailing 4-2, the Dodgers loaded the bases in the seventh when Jamey Carroll walked, pinch-hitter Garret Anderson singled against his former team and Martin walked with one out. But Kevin Jepsen struck out the struggling Ethier, then Kemp ended the inning on a forceout.	"We had an opportunity with the middle of the batting order. I mean, that's all you can ask for," Torre said. "Sure you want them to knock them in, but that's not always the case. We had our opportunity to do some stuff and we weren't able to."	The Angels took a 3-0 lead in the fourth on Torii Hunter's RBI double and Rivera's 10th homer, which landed in the Dodgers' bullpen with two outs. They've scored 12 of their 14 runs so far in the series with two outs.	"It was off the plate at least a half a foot, but you've got a good hitter up there that notices patterns, and he got all of it," Ely said about Rivera's homer. "He's a smart hitter and he was just sitting on a pitch he thought might be there."	The Angels added a run in the fifth on Howie Kendrick's RBI double that dropped inside the right-field line.	The Dodgers made it 4-2 in the bottom of the inning with Martin's two-run double.	Game notes	 The Dodgers fell to 8-4 on their season-long, 13-game homestand. ... Angels slugger Hideki Matsui, who turned 36 on Saturday, pinch-hit in the ninth. Matsui had homered on each of his previous two birthdays. When informed of that by a Japanese writer before the game, Torre said he'd intentionally walk Matsui, and he did. ... The Angels placed RHP Jason Bulger on the 15-day DL with a strained right shoulder and recalled RHP Rafael Rodriguez from Triple-A Salt Lake.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CLEVELAND -- Stephen Strasburg simply shrugged.	Two starts, two wins, 22 strikeouts and millions of fascinated fans. One dazzling debut -- and a pretty fair encore.	It's been quite a start for baseball's newest attraction. But while America buzzes about him, this Nationals treasure isn't buying the hype.	"Just another week, you know?" Strasburg said.	Hardly.	On Sunday, Washington's pitching powerhouse learned that life on the road isn't always smooth. Coming off a 14-strikeout opening act, Strasburg had more trouble with Cleveland's mound than Indians hitters during his second major league start, leading the Nationals to a 9-4 win.	Strasburg (2-0) allowed just two hits, one a leadoff homer in the second inning by Travis Hafner, who turned on one of the right-hander's 100 mph fastballs. He struck out eight and walked five before leaving to a chorus of boos in the sixth as Washington ended Cleveland's four-game winning streak.	The 21-year-old capped a whirlwind first few days in the majors. His dominating start against Pittsburgh was followed by an appearance on "The Late Show with David Letterman." He has been the subject of incessant sports talk radio shows, and seems to be on every TV station.	Strasburgmania is sweeping the land.	He's tuning it out.	"I'm still watching TV," he said of the media's insatiable interest in him. "I'm just not watching those channels."	Strasburg was in control from the outset, and appeared destined to dominate the Indians, who except for Hafner, couldn't catch up to his high or low heat through four innings. But Strasburg was bothered by loose dirt on the mound and twice requested repairs.	Following a walk in the sixth, he kicked at the dirt, showing frustration for the first time as a pro.	"Things like that are part of the game," he said. "I wish I could have handled it a little bit better. It kind of got me into a little funk. But it's good to experience this now. If it happens again, I'll make the right adjustment."	Strasburg's teammates are impressed with his temperament and talent.	"He's amazing," shortstop Ian Desmond said. "I saw that hole and it was pretty deep. He handled the adversity pretty well. A lot of guys would have been very upset. He didn't like it, but he handled it like a pro. What amazes me is his composure all the time."	When he was lifted by manager Jim Riggleman after walking two in the sixth to load the bases, Strasburg was booed by many of the same fans who came to see if the phenom was for real. Strasburg didn't disappoint, but he didn't deliver anything as sensational as his 14-K gem.	Strasburg's appearance drew 32,876 fans, the second-largest crowd at Progressive Field this season. On hand was another pitching prodigy, 91-year-old Hall of Famer Bob Feller, who fanned 15 in his first major league start as a 17-year-old in 1936.	"It's real refreshing to see anyone with such talent come into the league," said Feller, who sat in his usual seat in the press box. "He'll have good days and bad, but he'll have a lot more good than bad throwing 100 miles per hour. I wish him well."	Adam Dunn homered off David Huff (2-8), scored three times and accidentally barreled over Cleveland's hotshot prospect, catcher Carlos Santana.	Huff matched Strasburg through five innings, but gave up four runs in the sixth on Ivan Rodriguez's two-run double and Desmond's two-run triple.	Strasburg came out firing.	His first pitch -- a 99 mph fastball to leadoff hitter Trevor Crowe -- stirred the crowd, which reacted to the radar-gun posting with a collective gasp of excitement. He fanned Crowe and Shin-Soo Choo, giving him nine consecutive strikeouts over two games.	In the second, Hafner tied it at 1 with a laser shot into the Nationals' bullpen.	"With a guy like that, you have to look fastball," Hafner said. "He obviously has great stuff. He's really good."	Strasburg then retired Austin Kearns on a fly, fanned Russell Branyan and locked up Jhonny Peralta with an 83 mph changeup.	He ran, well, walked, into trouble in the fourth. After striking out Choo again, he issued the first two walks of his career. However, showing poise beyond his years, he responded by getting Kearns to flail at a low fastball and whiffing Branyan for the second time.	"He's amazing," catcher Rodriguez said, patting Strasburg on the shoulder. "He's a great teammate. His patience is tremendous. He's going to be fine."	Before he took the mound in the fifth, Strasburg summoned plate umpire Brian O'Nora for a look. The right-hander pointed to a rough spot and three members of the grounds crew added dirt and tamped the landing area seemingly to the satisfaction of baseball's new star.	He gave up his second hit, a broken-bat single to Santana in the sixth, then stumbled on a delivery to Hafner. He kicked the red clay in frustration after yielding his fourth walk and asked for further mound maintenance. As the workers were dispatched, Strasburg heard his first big league boos.	"When it comes to something like that, you could slip one time and roll an ankle and be out for a few weeks," Strasburg said. "The umpires were concerned about it, and they stepped up and got it right."	In the second, Santana learned a valuable lesson in his third major league game: Don't take your eyes off Dunn.	Santana was flattened near home plate by the 6-foot-6, 287-pound first baseman. Santana moved to his left to possibly catch an overthrow to first when he inadvertently stepped into the path of Dunn, who hit him so hard he did a backward somersault.	"It was a freak play," Dunn said. "He wasn't looking at me and I wasn't looking at him."	Game notes	 According to Elias Sports Bureau, only one pitcher since 1900 has had more strikeouts before issuing his first career walk than Strasburg, who fanned 19 before walking Santana in the fourth. Cincinnati's Johnny Cueto struck out 22 before his first walk in 2008.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

DETROIT -- Miguel Cabrera made an impressive swing look effortless.	Cabrera drove an outside pitch over the right-center fence in the eighth inning for a go-ahead, three-run homer that sent the Detroit Tigers to a 4-3 victory over the skidding Pittsburgh Pirates on Sunday.	"As long as you watch baseball, you won't see many guys that hit the ball to opposite field like that," Tigers manager Jim Leyland said. "People get used to it around here. But trust me, in the history of the game, there's not many guys that take it out to opposite field like it's nothing."	Leyland managed one of those players, Barry Bonds, for the first seven years of his career. Since Bonds left the Pirates in 1992 to sign with San Francisco, they haven't had a winning record.	Pittsburgh, an NL-worst 23-40, has lost a season-high eight straight to push the franchise closer to extending its run of futility. The Pirates have had 17 straight losing seasons, the longest streak in Major League Baseball, the NFL, NBA and NHL.	They looked as though they might finally end their skid until Carlos Guillen, who hit a leadoff home run in the 10th inning to give Detroit a 4-3 win Saturday night, singled as a pinch-hitter to open the eighth and chase starter Jeff Karstens.	Guillen and Johnny Damon, who drew a two-out walk against reliever Javier Lopez, were on base when Cabrera became the first major league hitter to reach 19 homers and 56 RBIs this season.	"Tough game," Pirates manager John Russell said.	Pittsburgh has had a lot of those.	Detroit, meanwhile, got another win at home, where its 20-10 record has helped offset a 13-19 mark on the road to leave the Tigers 2 1/2 games behind AL Central-leading Minnesota.	Armando Galarraga gave up two runs in his first home start since his near-perfect game.	"It was an unbelievable experience here that night, but it is important that I keep it in the past," he said.	Brad Thomas (4-0) replaced Galarraga and got the final out in the eighth inning for the win. Jose Valverde closed it for his 13th save, but gave up a run to end his scoreless streak at 25 appearances	Garrett Jones hit a solo homer in the second inning and an RBI double in the fourth to put Pittsburgh ahead 2-0.	Alex Avila hit a solo shot to center in the seventh to pull the Tigers within a run. Cabrera put them ahead on a homer off Octavio Dotel the next inning, handing Lopez (1-1) the loss.	"Big-time players want to be up there in big situations," Leyland said. "That's why they're big-time players."	Cabrera simply shrugged when told Leyland said that.	"Everyone wants to be in that situation," he said. "I'm just doing my job."	Russell is having a hard time doing his, leading a team that is struggling to score runs and is getting spotty pitching.	Karstens was charged with two runs on six hits and a walk in seven-plus innings, his longest start this season.	"Karstens did a great job, and he turned it over to the bullpen and they couldn't finish it off," Russell said. "That doesn't change what he did, a great start when we really needed one."	The Pirates are averaging just 2 1/2 runs per game during their losing streak.	Jones has done his part. He hit his second homer in two days -- and 10th this season. He also had two hits for the third straight game and drove in two runs in the series finale.	"When you are in a slump like this, everything you hit hard goes right at someone," Jones said. "That's what happened to everyone but me."	Game notes	 Detroit rookie OF Austin Jackson left after a half-inning because of back spasms and is day to day. ... Magglio Ordonez (strained oblique) missed his sixth straight game, but said he will play Tuesday when Detroit hosts the Washington Nationals. ... Pirates RHP Charlie Morton (shoulder) is scheduled to make a rehab start with Triple-A Indianapolis. ... Pirates OF Jose Tabata has a hit in each of his four career games. ... Pittsburgh was swept by Detroit for the first time in eight matchups.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK -- Jorge Posada said several teammates joked with him before he caught his first game in nearly a month. No one needed to say a thing when it was his turn to bat with the bases loaded in the fifth inning.	Posada hit a grand slam for the second straight day, Robinson Cano connected for his 100th career homer and the New York Yankees completed a three-game sweep of the Houston Astros with a 9-5 win Sunday.	"To be in the position to hit two grand slams is just amazing," Posada said. "A lot of players were telling me where to go and stuff like that, but it was fun to be back there."	Shortly after their victory, the Yankees tied Tampa Bay for first place in the AL East when the Rays lost to Florida 6-1. The Rays had sole possession of first for 51 days.	Catching for the first time since he broke his foot May 19, Posada, who came off the disabled list June 2, connected for his ninth grand slam after the Astros walked the bases loaded with two outs for the second inning in a row. Ramiro Pena, subbing for injured Alex Rodriguez, followed the walks by Brian Moehler (0-3) in the fourth with a two-run single to back Phil Hughes, who struggled when the rain started in the sixth.	Posada walked in his first two plate appearances. As the designated hitter and batting right-handed on Saturday, he hit his first grand slam since 2004. On Sunday, Posada was batting from the left side when he faced reliever Casey Daigle. Posada drove a 2-0 pitch to a similar spot in right-center as his slam landed Saturday, giving New York a 7-1 lead.	The last Yankee to hit grand slams in consecutive games was catcher Bill Dickey in 1937, according to STATS LLC. The last player to do it in the big leagues was Mets center fielder Carlos Beltran on July 16 and 18, 2006.	Posada was replaced by Francisco Cervelli in the ninth inning and Posada said his foot "got tired."	"It was not about soreness," he said.	Posada said he would continue treating the foot in the same manner and hopes to be ready to face Roy Halladay and the Philadelphia Phillies on Tuesday night after the team has a day off Monday.	Yankees manager Joe Girardi, however, said Posada was sore but not in the same spot where he broke the foot. The team will wait to see how Posada responds Monday before thinking about his next catching appearance.	A steady drizzle started soon after Posada's big hit and the Astros scored four times with two outs in the sixth against Hughes (9-1). Tommy Manzella drove in two runs with a single off shortstop Derek Jeter's glove to end a 10-pitch at-bat, and Kevin Cash followed with a two-run shot that ended Hughes' day.	Hughes won his fourth straight start but matched his season high for runs allowed, five. He walked two and struck out six.	New York scored twice in the bottom half on RBI singles by Nick Swisher and Brett Gardner for a 9-5 lead.	"Tommy came up with the big hit, then I hit the home run and you're thinking, 'Hey, a bloop and a blast and we could get in it,' and they answered," Cash said. "That makes it hard because every time you scored they'd pull away again."	Batting in A-Rod's No. 4 spot while the third baseman rested his sore hip for the third consecutive day, Cano hit his 13th homer in the fourth. That tied the score 1-all and helped the Yankees win their eighth straight at home, matching their longest winning streak at the second-year ballpark.	With his parents, who flew in from Houston on a redeye flight, watching from the stands, Yankees right fielder Chad Huffman led off the third with an infield single in his first big league at-bat. Huffman was called up from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre before the game to replace Marcus Thames, who went on the 15-day disabled list with a strained right hamstring.	"I was just trying to calm myself down. ... Kind of got out in front, got lucky a little bit but that's part of it," Huffman said of his first hit. "I looked up at the Jumbotron and saw my family jumping up and down. It was a good feeling."	Huffman reached base three times but was thrown out at third in the fourth to end a rally.	Astros pitchers walked 10.	"That definitely was a killer," manager Brad Mills said. "We allowed those guys to get on and you can't do that with a good hitting lineup. They're going to hurt you. That was our kind of Achillies today."	Moehler lost his sixth straight, dating to Sept. 1. He gave up four runs on five walks and four hits in 4 2/3 innings.	Game notes	 Pena made a diving catch of Michael Bourn's hot shot down the line while he was playing on the infield grass. ... Slumping 1B Lance Berkman was not in the Astros' lineup. Sensing Berkman's frustration, Mills wanted to give the slugger two days off. Houston has an off day Monday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CINCINNATI -- Zack Greinke was due, and Reds manager Dusty Baker knew it.	"You're always a little apprehensive and nervous when a guy of that quality is 1-8," Baker said. "You figure the law of averages is on his side."	Greinke struck out 12 in a five-hitter, ending a personal four-start skid and leading the Kansas City Royals to a 7-3 victory over Cincinnati on Sunday.	Greinke (2-8) allowed two solo homers to Joey Votto but was in control throughout his first victory since May 13 against Cleveland and his second complete game of the season.	The reigning AL Cy Young Award winner benefited from some rare run support. Kansas City hadn't scored more than six runs in any game while Greinke was on mound.	"One or two runs don't matter, but getting four runs at the end of the game made it a lot easier to pitch," he said.	Billy Butler set season highs with four hits, including a homer, and four RBIs for Kansas City, which took two of three in the weekend series. David DeJesus went 3 for 3 with a homer and scored four times.	"We've had a stretch of games where we haven't scored a lot of runs," Butler said. "I hadn't been able to get the pitchers to come to me. They were pitching me tough -- pounding me inside. Today, I was able to get them to come to me. I was able to stay back on the off-speed pitches."	The Royals scored six runs with two out, including Butler's two-run shot in the fifth that gave them a 3-2 lead. DeJesus singled and stole second before Butler hit a 1-0 pitch from Sam LeCure over the wall in center for his sixth homer and first since May 26 against Texas.	Butler added a two-run double in the seventh after the Royals chased LeCure (1-3), making it 5-2.	"That double to right field was huge," Kansas City managed Ned Yost said. "As long as he's driving in runs, I don't care how he does it."	Butler also doubled in the ninth to make it seven hits in his last eight at-bats.	LeCure allowed four runs and six hits in 6 2/3 innings. The rookie right-hander has faced Cy Young winners Greinke and St. Louis' Chris Carpenter and tough San Francisco starter Matt Cain in his last three games.	"I plan to play this game a long time, and if I want to be considered legitimate, then I have to prove that I can beat those guys," LeCure said.	DeJesus connected in the ninth against Nick Masset, hitting the struggling reliever's first pitch to him deep to center.	Votto hit his 13th homer in the bottom half but Greinke responded by striking out Jonny Gomes and Jay Bruce to end the game.	"You can see why he won the Cy Young Award," Baker said.	Votto also went deep in the first and Miguel Cairo had an RBI groundout as Cincinnati took a 2-1 lead.	Game notes	 Royals C Jason Kendall went 0 for 5 and is mired in a 1-for-28 skid. ... Reds 2B Brandon Phillips was scratched with a cramp in his right hamstring, which also forced him out of a game against Pittsburgh on May 27. Phillips had started every game this season and missed just five innings. His 15-game hitting streak is Cincinnati's longest of the season and the longest current streak in the majors.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

BALTIMORE -- Empowered by a rare series sweep on the road, the New York Mets are ready to make a run at first-place Atlanta in the NL East.	David Wright hit two homers, Chris Carter and Jason Bay also connected, and the Mets amassed a season-high 18 hits Sunday in an 11-4 rout of the Baltimore Orioles.	New York came to Camden Yards with a 9-18 record away from home. Now, after their first three-game road sweep since September 2008, in Milwaukee, the second-place Mets have won eight of nine overall to move within 1 1/2 games of the Braves.	"It's well documented, our record at home (24-10). We know how well we play at home," Bay said. "At some point you have to win some games on the road. Otherwise you can't make up any ground. It's a good start."	The Mets next play three games in Cleveland before concluding their road trip with three more at Yankee Stadium.	Instead of dreading the journey, New York is eager to get it on.	"The road trip isn't over yet. You can't overlook it, but you couldn't have picked a better start," Bay said.	Bay entered in an 0-for-16 skid before going 4 for 4 and scoring four of New York's season-high 11 runs. Wright and Alex Cora each had three hits, and Carter hit his second homer in three games.	"If we play good baseball, then we can be among the top-tier teams. We're playing good baseball," manager Jerry Manuel said. "Right now a lot of things are going our way."	Mike Pelfrey (9-1) gave up three runs, nine hits and three walks in six rocky innings but received enough offensive support to win his fifth straight decision.	The Mets outscored Baltimore 19-6 during the sweep and now stand at a season-high seven games over .500 (35-28).	"We're having fun," Carter said. "There's a lot of confidence right now."	Three of New York's home runs came off Kevin Millwood (0-8), who has yielded a major league-high 19 homers in 14 starts this season. The right-hander gave up eight runs and 11 hits in 5 1/3 innings.	"I'm a little confused. I feel like I've been trying too many things," Millwood said. "I've just got a million things running through my head instead of just trying to execute pitches, and that's nobody's fault but my own."	Adam Jones had three hits and two RBIs for the Orioles (17-46), who have lost 15 of 17 and are 2-7 under interim manager Juan Samuel. Baltimore is 0-10-1 in its last 11 series.	"I'm trying to stay as positive as I can for these guys," Samuel said. "My job is to keep these guys going, keep them focused, continue to improve in some areas that we can improve."	Held to one run in each of the first two games, Baltimore got 11 hits, which served as a source of hope for the downtrodden team.	"We've seen some guys starting to swing the bats a little bit better, so hopefully it gives us a chance to do more of the things that we want to do," Samuel said.	The game was all but decided in the first inning, when the Mets batted around and got six hits, including a two-run drive by Wright and a three-run shot by Carter.	Luke Scott hit a sacrifice fly and Jones singled in a run in the bottom half, and Baltimore closed to 5-3 in the second on a sacrifice fly by Miguel Tejada.	But Cora hit an RBI single in the third, Bay's fourth homer made it 7-3 in the fifth, and Wright capped a three-run sixth with a two-run drive off Mark Hendrickson.	Bay doubled and scored on a sacrifice fly by Cora in the seventh. Jones hit an RBI single in the bottom half.	Game notes	 After the game, the Orioles activated RHP Alfredo Simon (hamstring) from the 15-day disabled list and optioned RHP Brad Bergesen to Triple-A Norfolk. Bergesen had been pitching out of the bullpen, but will return to his starting role in the minors. "This is a guy that we think is going to be a starter here for a long time and he just needs to go down there and pitch," Samuel said. ... It was the eighth time this year Baltimore has been swept. ... Wright has 25 RBIs in his last 26 games. He has more homers this season (12) than he did all last year (10). ... Millwood has given up 20 runs in his last three starts. ... New York C Henry Blanco made the last out in four innings.

Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

BOSTON -- Cole Hamels was at his best after losing a lengthy at-bat.	Hamels cooled off Boston's surging lineup with seven strong innings, helping the Phillies beat the Red Sox 5-3 on Sunday to salvage the finale of the weekend series.	Raul Ibanez hit a two-run homer for the Phillies, who snapped a six-game road losing streak with just their eighth win in their last 24 games overall.	Adrian Beltre hit his ninth homer for Boston, which plated double digits in each of the first two games of the series, winning by a combined score of 22-4.	Hamels (6-5) allowed one run and five hits, struck out eight and walked two, stopping a personal three-game skid. The left-hander has yielded three runs or less in each of his last eight starts.	It was an interesting contrast of pitchers between the hard-throwing Hamels and knuckleballer Tim Wakefield.	"When he's got a good fastball, that's when he's good. He was good today, man. He beat a good team," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said. "They really work the count on you, and they'll take the ball the other way. They're a good team. They're very good."	Hamels' best inning may have been the sixth. He walked Victor Martinez on the 15th pitch of the at-bat, putting runners on first and third, but he got Beltre to bounce into an inning-ending double play.	"I probably should have drilled him on the first pitch. I'm just kidding," Hamels said. "He's a tough hitter and after a few pitches you just don't want to give in. You keep going after him and you're hoping that all of a sudden he starts sitting on a different pitch. I didn't want to make it easy, and after that it's just grinding away. It's going after the next guy."	Boston manager Terry Francona was impressed with how Hamels responded after Martinez's walk.	"For him to do what he did after that shows what kind of pitcher he is," he said. "That can take a lot out of a pitcher."	Wakefield (2-5) tossed 7 1/3 innings for Boston, allowing four runs and five hits. The 43-year-old right-hander also became the third active pitcher to reach 3,000 innings.	"That's pretty special," he said. "Unfortunately we lost today. We were facing a tough guy over there in Cole Hamels. Reaching 3,000 is pretty cool. There's not many guys that can say that."	Jose Contreras relieved Hamels and pitched a scoreless eighth. J.C. Romero was charged with two runs in the ninth, but Brad Lidge got the final two outs for his fourth save.	Philadelphia, which had lost its last six games at Fenway Park, strung together five consecutive hits during its four-run fourth.	"I know this: I know we can hit," Manuel said. "We've been hitting for five or six years, I know that. We hadn't been hitting, but we're going to. I've got a lot of faith and confidence in our guys."	Jayson Werth hit a tying RBI single and Ibanez belted the next pitch into the Phillies' bullpen in right to make it 3-1. Ben Francisco doubled and Juan Castro added an RBI single.	It was a welcome sight for Philadelphia, which has had trouble scoring the past few weeks.	Castro also hit a sacrifice fly in the ninth to make it 5-1.	Wakefield reached 3,000 innings when Shane Victorino flied out in the third, joining Philadelphia's Jamie Moyer and the New York Yankees' Andy Pettitte as the only active pitchers to reach the mark. Pettitte accomplished the feat on Friday night.	Game notes	 Red Sox OF Daniel Nava almost wasn't in the lineup one day after he became the second player ever to hit a grand slam on the first pitch of his initial major league plate appearance. But Francona elected to rest OF Mike Cameron, bothered by an abdominal strain. ... Nava still didn't have a name plate above his locker Sunday morning. ... The Phillies went 2-4 against the Red Sox this season, with Hamels getting both wins. ... Boston 1B Kevin Youkilis, hit on the right arm by a pitch Saturday, was given the day off. "He's a little sore," Francona said. ... The Phillies have Monday off before Roy Halladay faces New York ace CC Sabathia at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday. "That's going to be a pretty good matchup," Manuel said. "That'll be real good."	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Chris Volstad and the Florida Marlins gained some confidence after a successful weekend at Tampa Bay.	Volstad pitched six solid innings to stop a personal six-game winless streak and the Marlins got two RBIs from rookie Mike Stanton in a 6-1 victory over the Rays on Sunday.	"It was good to win a series, especially against record-wise the best team in baseball," Volstad said. "We're playing great right now. Let's keep it going."	Volstad (4-6) gave up one run and four hits, struck out three and walked four. He was 0-4 with a 4.91 ERA in six starts since earning a win against Washington on May 7.	Jorge Cantu and Wes Helms homered for the Marlins, who won two of three in the weekend series.	Tampa Bay first baseman Carlos Pena was hitless in four at-bats, ending his streak of six games with at least one homer. He finished two games shy of the major league record shared by Dale Long (Pittsburgh 1956), Don Mattingly (New York Yankees 1987) and Ken Griffey Jr. (Seattle 1993).	"That is really cool, no doubt about it, I was very happy to be mentioned among those players," Pena said.	The Rays dropped into a tie for first in the AL East with the New York Yankees, who beat Houston 9-5 Sunday. Tampa Bay had held sole possession of first for the past 51 days.	"We expected all those teams to be in it the whole entire time," Rays center fielder B.J. Upton said. "We're not going to change a thing. If we keep playing the baseball we know how to play and how we've been playing it, things will end up working out our way."	Boston and Toronto are also in contention for the AL East title.	Rays right-hander Jeff Niemann (6-1) allowed five runs and nine hits over six innings. He was 8-0 in 16 starts at home since losing to Boston on May 2, 2009.	"Just a lack of execution on my part," Niemann said. "They didn't miss any mistakes."	The Marlins scored four times in the sixth to take a 5-1 lead. Cantu went deep, Stanton hit an RBI single and Helms added a two-run shot.	Stanton, a highly touted prospect, also singled in a run with two out in the fourth. Through his first five games since joining the Marlins from Double-A Jacksonville on Tuesday, Stanton is hitting .368 with four RBIs in five games.	"Pretty productive," Stanton said. "I'm learning a lot, still. I'm fine with it. There's always room for improvement but I'm satisfied for the first week. Just keep pushing forward."	The Rays tied it at 1 in the bottom half on Ben Zobrist's sacrifice fly, which was caught by second baseman Dan Uggla. With Uggla running away from the infield, Carl Crawford easily beat his spinning throw to the plate.	Tampa Bay loaded the bases with one out in the fifth, but Volstad got grounders from Crawford and Evan Longoria to stave off the threat.	"I think that's an inning he can grow up on and get better," Marlins manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "I hope he learned from that and keeps getting better."	Game notes	 Helms hit his first homer since Sept. 2 in Saturday's 6-5 loss to the Rays. ... Marlins LHP Nate Robertson, moved to the bullpen due to a rainout and off day, will return to the rotation and start Friday's game against Tampa Bay. ... Crawford hit into a first-inning double play. It ended his stretch of 239 at-bats without grounding into a DP. ... Florida LHP Renyel Pinto (strained left hip) is expected to be activated from the 15-day disabled list on Tuesday. ... Tampa Bay 2B Sean Rodriguez had three hits and has a career-best 14-game hitting streak. ... Cantu has a hit in 12 straight games.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MILWAUKEE -- Two strong seasons in Japan gave Colby Lewis another chance in the major leagues.	Lewis won two strikeout titles in the Central League during his time overseas, and all the hitting he did turned out to be a big bonus for the rejuvenated right-hander.	Lewis scattered three hits over eight innings and added a key two-out single with the bases loaded to lead the Texas Rangers to a 7-2 win over the Milwaukee Brewers on Sunday.	"The last two years, I was able to swing the bat kind of like a National Leaguer over there in Japan," said Lewis, who spent the previous two seasons with the Hiroshima Carp before signing in the offseason with Texas. "I feel like it was a little bit of an advantage just to see a lot of pitches the last two years, just getting at-bats in Japan."	Josh Hamilton homered for the AL West-leading Rangers, who won their fifth in six games and handed Brewers ace Yovani Gallardo (6-3) his first loss since April 10.	"On any given day, anybody can get beat," Rangers manager Ron Washington said. "Today was his day."	Gallardo trailed 2-1 when he intentionally walked Andres Blanco in the sixth to get to Lewis, who snapped a 25 at-bat hitless streak for Rangers pitchers with the first hit of his career past outstretched third baseman Casey McGehee.	"I've seen him bat before that, he'd put some good swings on it. I was praying he would get a hit," Hamilton said.	Lewis (6-4) finished with two, but was just as good on the mound with a career high-tying 10 strikeouts and one walk. His only mistakes came against Prince Fielder, who hit two solo homers for Milwaukee.	Hamilton has homered in four of the last five games to give him 15 this season. His 10-game hitting streak matches his career best and he leads the majors in RBIs in June with 19.	"He's swinging the bat as well as I've seen him swing it," Washington said.	The Rangers slugger drew oohs, then boos from the crowd in the fourth. Hamilton swung and missed on a breaking ball, flinging the bat out of his hands as it sailed more than 100 feet away and six rows deep, clanging off an empty seat.	"That's just normal me," Hamilton said. "For some reason, I just throw it away. It's amazing. That's my favorite bat. It's always my favorite bat, too."	Three pitches later with a new bat in his hands, he crushed Gallardo's offspeed offering to right field for a two-run shot to give Texas a 2-1 lead.	In the sixth, Vladimir Guerrero extended his hitting streak to 11 games with a leadoff single before Hamilton doubled. After two strikeouts, Blanco, hitting .204, was walked intentionally to bring up Lewis.	Lewis followed with a gritty eight-pitch at-bat. He fouled away several fastballs and hit another offering off his foot before taking Gallardo's low curveball down the left-field line to give Texas a 4-1 lead.	"I was kind of surprised he was able to keep it fair," said Gallardo, who struck out 10 but had his winning streak snapped at six. "I was pretty upset. I walked the guy in front to pitch to the pitcher and with two strikes he just fouled them off. He does have a bat in his hands so anything is possible."	Hamilton's run-scoring groundout in the seventh and Julio Borbon's two-out, two-run double in the eighth off the Brewers bullpen made it 7-2.	Fielder had been slumping at the plate recently, but looked more comfortable after finishing Saturday night's 4-3 loss 0 for 5, including the final out with the tying run at third.	The first baseman's second home run of the game, a towering shot in the sixth, bounced high off the batter's eye to give him 12 this season and cut Texas' lead to 4-2, but Milwaukee could get no closer. Fielder, who has played in 248 straight games, insists he's comfortable at the plate.	"It's the same. You just go out there and try to feel good before the game and after that let it fly," he said. "It's not easy, but I'm not going to take a day off so I've got to get ready for the next day."	Game notes	 The Brewers are an NL-worst 11-19 at home. ... Borbon also has an 11-game hitting streak. ... Rangers 3B Michael Young doubled in the fourth and is one hit away from tying Ivan Rodriguez's franchise mark at 1,747. ... Rangers 1B Justin Smoak went 0 for 5 with five strikeouts, the first time a Rangers player has done that in a nine-inning game. ... Brewers LHP Doug Davis (inflammation of heart membrane) and Brewers RHP Todd Coffey (right thumb) are expected to go on rehab assignments this week.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

MINNEAPOLIS -- After a pair of pitching duels, Atlanta's offense broke loose and powered the Braves to another series victory.	Troy Glaus homered twice and tied a career high with four hits to lead Atlanta past the Minnesota Twins 7-3 on Sunday.	"He's been just an unbelievable pickup," Braves manager Bobby Cox said. "He just keeps swinging."	The Braves scored four runs in the first inning and built on the lead to support Kris Medlen. Atlanta took two of three in an interleague series between division leaders, a rematch of the thrilling 1991 World Series won by Minnesota in seven games.	After struggling early in the season, the Braves have won or tied their last 12 series since dropping two of three games to Washington from May 4-6. Atlanta is 14-6 over the last 20 games, all played without an off day.	"It was a tough stretch, but it's our job to win ballgames," Glaus said. "Nobody's going to feel sorry for us."	Making his 11th major league start, Medlen (4-1) tossed a career-high eight innings and held the Twins scoreless until Delmon Young's three-run homer with two outs in the seventh.	The Twins didn't get a hit off Medlen until Jason Kubel lined a double with one out in the fifth. The right-hander allowed four hits and struck out five.	"They threw a guy out there today that did everything right," Twins shortstop Trevor Plouffe said.	Tim Hudson lost the series opener 2-1 and Derek Lowe started the next day, a 3-2 win for the Braves. The early offense Sunday helped Medlen settle in and attack a Twins lineup missing its two starting middle infielders.	"Lowe and Hudson were calling me a run hog today," Medlen said. "Any time you get the offense swinging like they did early, it gives you the confidence to go out there and just start throwing strikes."	Glaus, who had three RBIs, hit his 12th and 13th home runs in consecutive at-bats in the fifth and seventh. It was the 29th multihomer game of his career and first since Aug. 9, 2008.	The slugger played only 14 games for St. Louis last season because of shoulder surgery and did not hit a home run. He signed a one-year, $1.75 million contract with the Braves during the offseason.	Glaus hit just .194 in April, but got rolling in May. Since May 1, he leads the NL with 40 RBIs. His batting average has improved to .290.	Martin Prado homered in the second and had three hits, raising his season total to an NL-best 90.	Twins manager Ron Gardenhire gave center fielder and leadoff hitter Denard Span his first day off this season. Michael Cuddyer got his first start at center in Target Field and Nick Punto hit leadoff.	Twins starter Kevin Slowey (7-4) entered with a three-game win streak and a 0.64 ERA in June. After allowing six runs (five earned) on nine hits in 4 2/3 innings, the right-hander's win streak is over and his June ERA stands at 2.89.	Despite a solid 3.84 ERA, Slowey has failed to pitch past the fifth inning in nine of his 13 starts.	"It's disappointing to go out there and feel like you put your team behind the 8-ball right away," Slowey said. "Even in that inning I felt like I made some good pitches."	Atlanta took the final two games from the Twins despite playing without third baseman Chipper Jones. He was a late scratch from Saturday's game and sat out Sunday with an injured right ring finger. He is day to day.	Jason Heyward started the Braves' four-run first with a broken-bat RBI double down the right-field line.	"Any time you break a guy's bat, you don't expect it to go that far," Slowey said.	Glaus singled to drive in Heyward, and Eric Hinske's double scored Brian McCann. Glaus scored the first of his three runs on Punto's error trying to throw out Hinske at second.	Sunday's win was the perfect way to end a season-long 11-game road trip for Atlanta. Since May 18, the Braves are 19-7.	Several players have stepped up during the recent run. Brooks Conrad filled in at third base for Jones on Saturday and delivered the winning suicide squeeze bunt in the ninth. Medlen continues to pitch well in the absence of Jair Jurrjens, and Glaus is on a roll.	"That's what good teams do," Hinske said. "Everyone gets prepared to step up when needed and win ballgames. You're seeing that happen with us because everyone understands what needs to be done to compete."	Young's home run extended his hitting streak to 10 games. He has 13 RBIs during the streak and is second on the Twins with 43.	Game notes	 Twins 2B Orlando Hudson took batting practice and hopes to return from a sprained left wrist on Tuesday. ... Braves infielder Omar Infante remains out after fouling a ball off the top of his right foot Friday. Infante will likely miss the next two or three games. ... Twins RHP Clay Condrey, who has yet to pitch this season because of an elbow injury, went to Florida to get some work in extended spring training. ... Twins pitching coach Rick Anderson missed the game to attend his daughter's high school graduation.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

DENVER -- Jeff Francis finally got a win at Coors Field.	Francis pitched seven innings to earn his first home win in two years and the Colorado Rockies beat the Toronto Blue Jays 10-3 Sunday to complete a three-game series sweep.	"It's been a long time," Francis said, "but wins are wins, regardless of where they are. I think it was a good day for everybody. The bats broke out nicely."	Ryan Spilborghs homered twice and Carlos Gonzalez also connected for the Rockies, who picked up their second series sweep of the season. Gonzalez drove in three runs and Clint Barmes and Chris Iannetta had two RBIs apiece.	The Rockies had scored four or fewer runs in 10 of their previous 13 games before busting out for their highest total since they scored 11 runs May 29 against the Dodgers.	Francis (2-2) allowed two earned runs and five hits for his first win at Coors Field since June 18, 2008. The left-hander missed last season after undergoing shoulder surgery and didn't make his 2010 debut until May 6.	Jesse Litsch (0-1) lasted 2 1/3 innings in his first start for Toronto since undergoing Tommy John surgery last June. The right-hander gave up seven runs and nine hits.	"He threw a couple of strikes and couldn't put anybody away," Blue Jays manager Cito Gaston said. "What I saw today wasn't what I saw in 2008 before he left. I don't know what to think right now. I hope he is back."	Spilborghs also tripled, tying a career high with 11 total bases. Todd Helton, trying to shake a season-long slump, matched his season high with three hits and scored twice. He is 7 for 16 in four games since moving into the second spot in Colorado's lineup.	The Rockies finished a 4-3 homestand against Houston and Toronto and have not had a losing homestand since Jim Tracy took over as manager on May 29, 2009.	"We squared balls up," Tracy said. "We took some good two-strike at-bats."	Colorado scored three runs in the third to take a 7-3 lead. Spilborghs led off with his fifth homer, Barmes hit his second run-scoring double of the game and Francis added a sacrifice fly.	The Rockies' outburst came after they helped Toronto score three runs in the top half.	Jose Bautista led off with a single, breaking a string of 23 hitless at-bats, and second baseman Jonathan Herrera made a wide throw trying to complete a double play on Aaron Hill's bouncer. Left fielder Spilborghs let Adam Lind's single get past him, putting runners on second and third.	Vernon Wells drove in a run with a groundout and Alex Gonzalez had an RBI double. Herrera's error on Lyle Overbay's grounder allowed Gonzalez to score.	Francis retired the final 12 batters he faced after a leadoff walk in the fourth.	"The first four innings I was battling a lot of command issues," he said. "My last three innings were pretty smooth and [I] really was putting the ball where I wanted to."	The Rockies batted around in the first and jumped out to a 4-0 lead. Gonzalez had an RBI single, Iannetta singled in a pair with two out, and Barmes followed with a run-scoring double.	Gonzalez and Spilborghs went deep in the sixth. Gonzalez hit a two-run drive for his 10th homer. With two out, Spilborghs hit his sixth for the fifth multihomer game of his career.	Game notes	 Rockies SS Troy Tulowitzki, who strained his right groin Friday, rested for the second straight game. The Rockies are off Monday and Tulowitzki is expected to be in the lineup Tuesday at Minnesota. ...

SAN DIEGO -- Felix Hernandez wasn't happy to see Seattle manager Don Wakamatsu come out of the dugout in the ninth inning to replace him.	Hernandez came within one out of a complete game and the Mariners held on for a 4-2 win over the San Diego Padres on Sunday, snapping a five-game losing streak.	One day after a players-only meeting that followed a 7-1 loss Saturday night, Hernandez's gem couldn't have come at a better time for struggling Seattle.	"We talked about having a tremendous performance by Felix and he went out and did," Wakamatsu said. "A gutsy performance."	Hernandez pitched a dominant game to stem the tide of eight losses in nine games for the Mariners. They had dropped five of six on this road trip, getting outscored 44-14.	"It was a must-win," said Milton Bradley, who hit a two-run homer. "The way we've been playing was unacceptable. The way I've been playing has been unacceptable. It's time to do something about it, starting with myself."	Bradley's homer tied it in the fourth and Jose Lopez doubled home the go-ahead run in the eighth.	Hernandez (4-5) held the Padres in check other than a two-run, inside-the-park homer by Tony Gwynn in the third inning. The right-hander gave up four hits, tied his season high with nine strikeouts and walked one while throwing a season-high 128 pitches.	"He has turned into one of the true No. 1s on a major league staff," Padres manager Bud Black said.	While the Mariners were not willing to credit their closed-door meeting for Sunday's performance, Hernandez said it was positive.	"We talked about good things and then we went out there and fought," Hernandez said. "It's important for us, I'm not going to lie. Our minds are better."	Hernandez was within one out of his second complete game this season when he was replaced by David Aardsma. Wakamatsu's trip to the mound produced a lighthearted moment after the manager motioned for the pitching change when he came out of the dugout.	"I asked him, 'Why don't you come to the mound first and ask me how I feel?'" Hernandez said with a smile. "He said, 'I know the answer, that's why.'"	Adrian Gonzalez had reached on a one-out bloop single in the ninth before Scott Hairston forced him at second base for the second out. Aardsma then replaced Hernandez and retired Nick Hundley for his 13th save in 17 chances.	Hernandez threw first-pitch strikes to 20 of his 31 batters.	"Four hits tells you what kind of stuff he had," Wakamatsu said. "But to get deep in the game, you have to get ahead of the hitters. I thought he attacked the zone."	Bradley's homer, his fifth, came off starter Clayton Richard, and was his second in three games.	Lopez broke a 2-all tie in the eighth when he doubled into the left-field corner off Luke Gregerson (1-2). The hit scored Chone Figgins, who led off with a single.	Gregerson had his string of 13 2/3 scoreless innings snapped.	Ichiro Suzuki added an RBI double in the ninth off Joe Thatcher. Rob Johnson, who led off the inning with a single, finished with three hits to tie his career high.	Gwynn put the Padres ahead with his inside-the-park shot. Following Jerry Hairston Jr.'s leadoff double, Gwynn hit a sinking line drive to center field that Franklin Gutierrez failed to field as he tried for a diving catch.	The ball got past Gutierrez, who initially hesitated coming in, and rolled all the way to the wall before left fielder Bradley retrieved it. By that time, the speedy Gwynn was rounding third, and he scored standing up without a throw.	It was Gwynn's second homer of the season and his first inside-the-park shot.	"I knew that once he missed it, I figured that they were probably playing me a little shallow," Gwynn said. "I knew the ball was going to roll all the way to the wall, so I just put my head down and ran."	The only other hit off Hernandez was a single by Scott Hairston leading off the seventh.	Hernandez appeared to pick off Scott Hairston at first base before plate umpire Angel Hernandez called him for a balk, sending the runner to second. He advanced to third on a groundout, but Hernandez got out of the inning by striking out Will Venable and getting Hairston Jr. on a grounder.	Richard allowed five hits over seven innings. The left-hander walked four and struck out two.	Game notes	 Suzuki's ninth-inning double extended his interleague hitting streak to 17 games, the top active streak in the majors. Suzuki is batting .429 (33 for 77) during the streak. ... Gwynn's father, Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn, had two inside-the-park homers in his 20-year career. ... Black was back after missing Saturday's game to attend his daughter's graduation from Oregon State.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Aubrey Huff backed Matt Cain with two big swings, and cracked on the surging right-hander after another Giants win.	Huff hit a pair of two-run homers, Cain powered his way to his fourth consecutive win and San Francisco beat the Oakland Athletics 6-2 on Sunday to complete a three-game series sweep.	"I already stole your thunder Cain," Huff joked as the pitcher spoke with reporters in the clubhouse.	"That's the answer to all your questions," Cain laughed in response.	Huff signed a one-year deal with the Giants in the offseason and got off to a sluggish start. He batted .247 with two homers in April but has been a tear since then, hitting .336 since May 1.	The veteran slugger, who had 15 homers with Baltimore and Detroit last season, has six homers and 13 RBIs over his last 16 games alone.	"The first month of the season I really tried to beat it and got in a lot of bad habits," Huff said. "I just got to a point where I stopped caring and just started seeing the ball and hitting it. If it goes, it goes. If it doesn't you take your doubles and triples."	The Giants, who were swept by the A's last month in Oakland, improved to 8-4 in June after scuffling to a 14-14 mark in May. They moved a season-high eight games over .500 and pulled within 1 1/2 games of first-place San Diego in the NL West.	Manager Bruce Bochy altered his lineup before the game, moving Pablo Sandoval into the No. 2 slot while dropping Juan Uribe to fourth in the order.	The changes worked nicely.	Sandoval walked in the sixth and scored on Huff's ninth homer. Uribe, batting cleanup for only the sixth time this season, followed with a drive to left to make it 4-1.	Sandoval also walked in the eighth before Huff hit a 2-2 pitch from Craig Breslow over the wall in right for his 10th career multihomer game.	"We got shut down at their place and we certainly wanted to return the favor," Bochy said. "There's no getting around that. We wanted to get even with them and guys played well."	Cain (6-4) allowed one run and eight hits over seven innings. He is 4-0 with a 0.55 ERA in four starts since his last loss May 22 at Oakland, when the A's got an unearned run off the hard-throwing righty in a 1-0 victory.	"I'm just trying to get guys to swing early," Cain said. "I think I'm locating both sides of the plate a little better. That carries into being able to get other stuff working as well."	Jack Cust had three singles for Oakland, which dropped its sixth straight game at AT&T Park.	"We made too many mistakes," A's manager Bob Geren said. "There were some positive things but there were errors that led to runs. It wasn't a good series, it really wasn't. We had too many things go wrong in a three-game series to overcome."	Vin Mazzaro (2-1) pitched a season-best six innings for Oakland, yielding four runs, three earned, and six hits.	Cain ran his scoreless streak to 16 innings before Landon Powell hit a two-out RBI single in the fourth. Cliff Pennington then doubled to right but Powell was thrown out trying to score, ending the inning.	Cain pitched out of another jam in the sixth. With one out and runners at the corners, he struck out Adam Rosales and retired Powell on a bouncer to second.	San Francisco's bullpen nearly let Cain's latest gem get away. Reliever Dan Runzler's throwing error set up Kevin Kouzmanoff's RBI single in the eighth. Guillermo Mota then came in and walked two batters to load the bases before Santiago Casilla got pinch-hitter Mark Ellis to pop up for the final out of the inning.	The Giants grabbed a 1-0 lead in the second. Pat Burrell singled, took second on a throwing error by third baseman Kouzmanoff and scored on Bengie Molina's single.	Game notes	 Oakland 3B Eric Chavez (neck spasms) told manager Bob Geren he is not yet ready to begin his minor league rehab assignment. ... Giants 2B Freddy Sanchez got the day off. ... Kouzmanoff extended his career-high hitting streak to 14 games. ... The A's designated backup C Jake Fox for assignment, clearing the way for C Kurt Suzuki to return from the bereavement list.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

LOS ANGELES -- A few hours before the Los Angeles Angels left on a daunting 14-game road trip two weeks ago, slugger Kendry Morales broke his leg while jumping on home plate.	That already-infamous pratfall hardly seemed to be a good omen -- yet the Angels have barely made a misstep since, and they capped their remarkable odyssey with a little bit of history in their crosstown rivals' famous park.	Hideki Matsui had three hits and drove in two runs, Jered Weaver pitched into the seventh inning and the Angels swept an interleague Freeway Series at Dodger Stadium for the first time with a 6-5 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Sunday.	Mike Napoli hit an eighth-inning homer for the Angels, who improved to a season-best six games over .500 at 36-30 with their 10th win in 12 games, staying just a half-game behind first-place Texas in the AL West.	All that travel has turned around a slow-starting season for the Angels, who wrapped up their road work with 11 wins, the franchise's most on a single trip since 1962.	"Winning cures everything, and we're doing a lot of it," said Torii Hunter, who hit his 10th homer. "We were actually talking about wearing our grays tomorrow [at home against Milwaukee]. I don't know if that's illegal or what. We want to act like we're still on the road. I might keep my bags packed."	James Loney drove in three runs with two late doubles for the Dodgers, connecting against Kevin Jepsen in the seventh and Fernando Rodney in the eighth to trim the Angels' lead to a run. But closer Brian Fuentes capped the bullpen's rocky performance with his 10th save, getting speedy Rafael Furcal to ground into a game-ending double play.	"We always saw the potential for us to play better," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "You'd like to see it a little cleaner [in the late innings], but they held the lead, that's the bottom line. [The Dodgers] hit some good pitches. That double play in the ninth, I don't think you'll see a better turn than what Howie [Kendrick] did at second base."	Furcal hit a leadoff homer before stranding four runners in the final three innings for the Dodgers, who were swept at home for the first time since Houston did it in May 2008.	Manny Ramirez had two long doubles among his three hits for the Dodgers, who were on a remarkable 24-8 roll until running into their freeway foes this weekend. After ending their longest homestand of the season with eight wins in 13 games, they'll meet the Angels again in nine days in Anaheim.	"Is it incomprehensible for us to get swept at home? No," said outfielder Andre Ethier, who went 0 for 4. "I mean, if you go out and play like that, you're going to get swept. They picked up runners when they had an opportunity, and we didn't. It's as simple as that. That team is very good at getting the momentum to swing their way and using it to their advantage."	After Furcal's second homer of the season off the screen on the right-field foul pole, the Dodgers struggled mightily against Weaver (6-3), who yielded five hits and struck out seven while winning for just the second time in seven starts.	Weaver even struck out his older brother, Jeff, the Dodgers' long reliever who took over in the third inning for struggling Carlos Monasterios (3-1). The Venezuelan rookie took the first loss of his major league career in his 16th appearance, allowing seven hits and three walks.	The Weavers hadn't batted against each other since they were kids playing Wiffle Ball in their backyard in Simi Valley, Calif., although Jeff beat Jered last June 20 at Angel Stadium when they started against each other in the eighth matchup between brothers in baseball history.	"It's 1-0 Jered," the Angels' Weaver proclaimed with a grin. "We'll be saving that video, that's for sure. ... I tried not to look him in the eye, because I knew I'd be busting up laughing."	Two brothers hadn't faced each other in a major league game since Sept. 26, 2007, when Boston's Julio Lugo batted against Oakland's Ruddy Lugo.	Matsui got the day off on his 36th birthday Saturday, but returned with another sizzling game for the Angels. He had an RBI single in the first inning, a double in the third and another run-scoring single in the fifth, improving to 20 for 48 with 12 RBIs in June.	Game notes	Bobby Abreu also had three hits for the Angels. ... Ramirez had been in an 8-for-36 slump on the Dodgers' homestand before getting two doubles and a single, including a shot that bounced into the left-field stands behind the Mannywood sign. ... The first pitch was thrown out by Jonathan Goldsmith, the gray-bearded actor famous for his role as "The Most Interesting Man in the World" in a marketing campaign for Dos Equis beer. The 71-year-old Goldsmith's strong throw came in thigh-high and just off the plate, prompting public-address announcer Eric Smith to intone, "That was the most interesting pitch in the world."	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PHOENIX -- The Arizona Diamondbacks went from stunned to elated in one wild ninth inning.	Chris Young rescued Arizona's much-maligned bullpen with his second homer of the game, a two-run shot in the bottom of the ninth that gave the Diamondbacks a 7-5 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals.	"You talk about a range of emotions. What a game," Arizona manager A.J. Hinch said. "We scored a lot of runs [five] with two outs and that's a good sign."	Albert Pujols had three RBIs for the Cardinals, who trailed by three going into the ninth before rallying to tie it on a wild pitch by winner Esmerling Vasquez (1-2).	Kyle McClellan (0-2) retired the first two Diamondbacks in the bottom half before Miguel Montero singled and Young hit a drive to left.	"He put a good swing on a bad pitch," McClellan said, "and that's what big league hitters do."	Adam LaRoche doubled home two runs in the first inning and added an RBI single in the seventh for Arizona. Young hit a solo homer in the fourth.	The Diamondbacks' bullpen, with the worst ERA in the majors at 7.33 entering the day, couldn't hold the lead. Felipe Lopez doubled leading off the ninth and closer Chad Qualls was charged with an error when he bobbled a toss to first base on Colby Rasmus' grounder.	Pujols hit an RBI single and, one out later, Randy Winn drove in a run with a single. Vasquez came on for Qualls and uncorked a wild pitch that allowed Pujols to score the tying run.	Vasquez was charged with a blown save, but he retired Yadier Molina and Skip Schumaker with Winn on second to keep the score tied.	Moments later, Young ended it.	"Adrenalin was flowing and at that point, you're just trying to see it and hit it," Young said. "He gave me a good pitch to hit. I knew it had a chance."	Arizona starter Edwin Jackson got through 6 2/3 innings and scattered eight hits before departing with runners on second and third. He hasn't beaten the Cardinals in five appearances.	St. Louis ace Chris Carpenter wasn't sharp with his command through his six innings. He had to wiggle out of two bases-loaded situations in his last two innings of work and walked a season-high five. He struck out eight and allowed six hits.	The Diamondbacks got two runs in the seventh off reliever Dennys Reyes. Stephen Drew hit a leadoff double and scored on LaRoche's single. Montero then hit an RBI double high off the center-field wall.	Montero caught his first full game in two months after a long stint on the disabled list with a partially torn meniscus in his right knee.	Pujols lined a two-run double in the seventh off reliever Aaron Heilman, with both runs charged to Jackson. Pujols was 2 for 11 in the three-game series and finished the team's six-game road trip 3 for 22.	The Cardinals went 1-5 on their road trip through Los Angeles and Arizona.	"Tough loss and tough road trip," manager Tony La Russa said. "We gave ourselves a great chance and I thought we were going to pull it off but we didn't."	Game notes	 Diamondbacks LHP Dontrelle Willis has a minor infection in his left hand after splitting a nail during his last start, though Hinch said it can't get worse. Willis will be available out of the bullpen as a situational lefty when the Diamondbacks are in Boston starting Monday. Carpenter tied a career high with two hits.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO -- First, a championship celebration. Then, a near no-hitter.	It was quite a night at Wrigley Field and in the end it belonged to Ted Lilly -- no matter how close Gavin Floyd came to matching him.	Lilly took a no-hitter into the ninth inning before pinch-hitter Juan Pierre led off with a single, and the Chicago Cubs held on to beat the White Sox 1-0 Sunday night in a revved-up old ballpark.	"There was so much energy," Lilly said. "I can't remember that much energy. I guess I'd have to go back to 2001 in the World Series, some of the big game-winning homers, to get that kind of a feeling. It was awesome -- really, really special."	On a night when the NHL's Chicago Blackhawks were saluted for their Stanley Cup championship, Lilly and Floyd put on a jaw-dropping display on the mound.	"It was a fun game for everybody. Obviously it was an intense game to the end," Floyd said.	Floyd flirted with a no-hitter of his own for the White Sox before Alfonso Soriano doubled with two outs in the bottom of the seventh. Chad Tracy followed with a single, producing the game's only run.	That took care of Floyd's no-hit bid -- but Lilly was still going and the tension began to mount as he inched closer to the first no-hitter at storied Wrigley Field since Milt Pappas blanked San Diego on Sept. 2, 1972.	Fans booed loudly when Gordon Beckham of the White Sox tried to bunt for a hit in the eighth. He fouled it off and wound up popping up for the second out. The crowd roared after Jayson Nix popped out to end the inning.	"If you bunt in the ninth that's not professional, but in the eighth ... but Wrigley Field people, that's the only thing they can do is boo," White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen said. "They boo for every freaking thing here. That's part of the game, but the ninth, that's kind of a different thing."	Lilly couldn't close it out.	Pierre, batting for Floyd with rain falling in the ninth, lined an 0-1 slider to center for a clean single that chased Lilly, who left to a standing ovation but showed little emotion on his way to the dugout. The left-hander also took a no-hitter into the eighth inning for the New York Yankees at Seattle on April 27, 2002, losing the game 1-0 on Desi Relaford's RBI single.	"I was just looking for something out over the plate and he threw it there and I put a good swing on that," Pierre said.	For Lilly, the hit was a downer. He said he was "determined to get it done" but "made a bad pitch."	"In a situation like that there's a tendency to second-guess my pitch selection," he said. "I can do that. But also it wasn't a very good pitch, either. No question there's a little bit of a letdown. You kind of get over that and realize we're in a 1-0 game and we've got to somehow find a way to win this game."	Carlos Marmol came in and walked Andruw Jones before a balk put runners at second and third with nobody out. Marmol struck out Alexei Ramirez, then intentionally walked Alex Rios to load the bases for a surging Paul Konerko, who came into the game on a 20-for-42 tear.	With White Sox fans chanting "Paulie! Paulie!" he grounded into a force at the plate. Carlos Quentin flied to center to end the game, giving Marmol his 13th save in 16 chances.	It was the latest exceptional performance on the mound this season, which is becoming the year of the pitcher. Ubaldo Jimenez tossed a no-hitter for Colorado, while Oakland lefty Dallas Braden and Philadelphia ace Roy Halladay each hurled a perfect game.	And that doesn't even include Armando Galarraga's near-perfect game on June 2 for Detroit, spoiled when umpire Jim Joyce blew a call at first base.	The last time two big league teams were both held hitless through 6 1/2 innings was July 13, 1980, in a game between the Yankees and White Sox, according to STATS LLC.	In Chicago, it's been far from a perfect season, with both teams struggling.	The win was the first for Lilly (2-5) since he beat Milwaukee in his first start this season. He struck out three, walked one and hit two batters with pitches after going 0-5 in his previous eight starts. The Cubs won for only the fourth time in 13 games while avoiding a sweep against their crosstown rivals.	"There were probably three or four innings in a row I didn't have to move my glove much," catcher Koyie Hill said. "He was in a groove."	The White Sox had won five straight against the Cubs, and around the fifth inning, Floyd started thinking about a no-hitter.	"I remember both teams hitting some balls [hard] but I wasn't really paying attention," he said. "I just looked up at the scoreboard and there wasn't any hits. That's kind of neat."	Instead of making history, Floyd (2-7) took a tough-luck loss and the White Sox had their season-high four-game winning streak snapped.	Floyd allowed three hits and walked three while striking out a season-high nine in his fourth career complete game. He came up just short on a night when he and Lilly both were brilliant.	Game notes	 The only double no-hitter through nine innings in major league history was May 2, 1917, at Wrigley Field, with Cincinnati's Fred Toney and Chicago's Hippo Vaughn on the mound. The Reds beat the Cubs 1-0 in 10 innings.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

ST. LOUIS -- Albert Pujols has a souvenir from the St. Louis Cardinals' latest victory: a good-sized welt on the left side of his neck.	The three-time NL MVP took one off the noggin on a perfect day at the plate, stand-in cleanup hitter Ryan Ludwick homered and the Cardinals beat the Seattle Mariners 9-3 on Monday night behind a reworked batting order.	"You could have written that group any way you wanted to and we would have had some runs," manager Tony La Russa said.	Pujols singled three times and walked twice as the Cardinals bounced back after totaling 19 runs during a 1-5 West Coast swing that dropped them out of the NL Central lead. Plus, he stayed in the game after a throw to the plate struck him near the left ear flap in the fifth.	"Took it like a champ," Ludwick said in admiration.	Although Pujols' ear flap absorbed some of the impact, La Russa said the team was worried initially.	"We kept asking, 'Are you dizzy, do you have a headache or anything?' And he said 'No, no, no,'" La Russa said. "He's a tough guy, he's proven that over and over again."	Pujols said simply: "I'm alright."	Ludwick finished with four RBIs and Adam Wainwright (9-4) pitched into the eighth after a shaky start. Matt Holliday also was a success batting second for the first time in his career, getting two hits and scoring twice.	"Listen, bro, he's the head of this organization and he's the one that drives the ship," Pujols said of La Russa's batting order. "As a player, I'm happy just to be in the lineup. It doesn't matter where he puts us, you've got to perform.	"We know that we have to get it going."	The Mariners have lost six of seven, fizzling after Ichiro Suzuki hit the second pitch of the game for his 31st career leadoff homer -- tying Chuck Knoblauch for 10th place. Suzuki also doubled in the eighth for his major league-leading 31st multihit game.	Suzuki was the first left-handed hitter to homer off Wainwright this season.	"I've heard he could win the home run derby if he wanted to," Wainwright said. "Everybody knows he has power, especially on the pitch I threw him."	Luke French (0-1) replaced struggling Ian Snell in Seattle's rotation and allowed four runs in four innings.	"I wanted to go deeper and the first couple of innings were pretty rough," French said. "The last two innings, I felt like I made the adjustment, made better pitches, got more ground balls, but I was definitely frustrated with the number of quality strikes."	Colby Rasmus homered in a four-run fifth off Snell, one of the runs scoring when Pujols broke for the plate on David Freese's chopper to third and was struck by Jose Lopez's errant throw.	Pujols was helped off the field by teammate Yadier Molina after receiving treatment from a trainer, but just moments later was chatting with teammates in the dugout.	The Mariners had two runs on three hits in the first against Wainwright, and no runs and one hit over the next six innings. It was Wainwright's 21st consecutive home start with three or fewer runs on his line, the longest streak in major league history, according to research by the Elias Sports Bureau.	"You like the way the game started," Mariners manager Don Wakamatsu said. "To give a guy like Wainwright a lead right back, it took a lot of momentum away."	Ludwick batted fourth in place of Holliday, coming off a 3-for-22 trip. Ludwick hit a three-run homer in the first, a sacrifice fly in the third and doubled and scored in the fifth.	"I think the main thing is wherever you're at, just getting a good pitch to hit," Ludwick said. "I'm not reading too much into it, obviously. Matt's a great hitter."	Game notes	 The Mariners are 15-17 at home and 9-23 on the road. ... Entering the game, Ludwick had a single and no RBIs in 13 career at-bats against Seattle. ... Wainwright is 55-28 in 100 career starts with St. Louis. ... Suzuki has 245 interleague hits for fifth on the career list, one more than Ivan Rodriguez.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Casey McGehee's first game at Angel Stadium was an eventful one. Just ask Torii Hunter and Erick Aybar.	McGehee homered off the glove of the leaping Hunter in center field, then knocked Aybar out of the game with a hard but clean takeout slide in the seventh inning of the Milwaukee Brewers' 12-2 victory against the Los Angeles Angels on Monday night.	Ryan Braun hit his third career grand slam and finished with five RBIs for the Brewers. Corey Hart had three hits and two RBIs.	Hunter, a nine-time Gold Glove winner, timed his leap perfectly on McGehee's drive off Joe Saunders in the sixth. But the ball spun off the webbing of his glove and disappeared behind the center-field fence.	Hunter has pulled back home run bids by opposing players more than 30 times in his career -- including one by Barry Bonds in the 2002 All-Star Game at Milwaukee's Miller Park -- according to the Angels.	"I wasn't sure," McGehee said. "I know the ball was carrying pretty good during batting practice, but being my first time here, I didn't know how much it took to get one out over there. I kind of decided that it was just going to be another tough-luck out. I think someone could make a pretty good special on watching him take back homers and make great plays in the outfield."	McGehee was hit by a pitch from Trevor Bell during Milwaukee's five-run seventh, after Brewers starter Randy Wolf (5-6) had plunked Maicer Izturis and Howie Kendrick two innings apart. McGehee was forced at second on Carlos Gomez's grounder to fill-in first baseman Kevin Frandsen, who made shortstop Aybar stretch way to his right -- leaving him vulnerable to McGehee's straight-on slide.	The knee-on-knee collision left Aybar with a hyperextended left knee, and he had to be helped off by trainer Ned Bergert and an assistant.	"He's walking around a little bit, and tomorrow he'll get examined and we'll get a better indication of what's going on," manager Mike Scioscia said. "We're relieved to see him walking around in this clubhouse. Erick's a tough kid. We're cautiously optimistic."	McGehee was booed by the crowd of 39,289 as he left the field following the play, and got the same treatment when he came up in the ninth.	But Scioscia said it was a clean slide. When the manager's comments were replayed on the TV in the visiting clubhouse, McGehee made sure he heard every word -- as well as the update on Aybar's condition.	"By no means was I trying to hurt anybody. I've got a clear conscience. There was no intent," McGehee said. "I just went in hard, trying to break up a double play. Unfortunately, he was in an awkward position. Hopefully, he sees the video and sees that I wasn't going out of my way trying to do anything malicious.	"You never want to see anybody get hurt in this game, but it does happen," McGehee added. "They're known for playing hard-nosed, aggressive baseball, so hopefully they understand where I'm coming from. I play the game right."	Wolf allowed three hits over seven innings -- all of them in the second, including a two-run double by Frandsen. The left-hander retired his final 13 batters after hitting Kendrick on the left arm to load the bases with two out in the third. Wolf escaped that jam by retiring Juan Rivera on a fly ball.	It was a much better performance than Wolf's previous start, when he gave up a career-worst five homers against the Cubs.	"It took me a day to forget about that. I had a day of mourning," Wolf said with a smirk. "I was very discouraged after that game, but it may turn out to be the best thing that could have happened. Sometimes you need to get your butt kicked to get yourself in the right frame of mind."	Saunders (5-7) gave up six runs and six hits over 5 1/3 innings. The left-hander, coming off a complete-game victory last Wednesday at Oakland, is 1-6 with a 6.75 ERA in eight home starts -- compared to 4-1 with a 2.45 ERA in six outings on the road.	Frandsen started at first base for the first time in the major leagues, becoming the fourth player the Angels have started at that position in 16 games since Kendry Morales went down for the season with a broken left leg.	Game notes	 Saunders has a 9.41 ERA in his 29 career losses, and a 1.97 ERA in his 53 victories. He was 4-1 over his previous six outings. ... Braun is on track to become the first player in Brewers history to start in three consecutive All-Star games. He leads all NL outfielders in the fan balloting, after garnering the most outfield votes in each of the previous two years.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN DIEGO -- Toronto Blue Jays right-hander Shaun Marcum was chilling in the visitor's clubhouse, his night's work finished, when he heard on the TV broadcast that Petco Park had been hit by an earthquake.	"First earthquake. That was pretty fun," Marcum said after the Jays beat the San Diego Padres 6-3 on Monday. "I didn't feel it until they said something on TV. The TVs were moving a little bit and I started floating back and forth a little bit. That's always fun."	Play stopped momentarily in the eighth inning as Petco Park swayed during the magnitude-5.7 quake that was centered about five miles southeast of Ocotillo in Imperial County -- about 85 miles east of San Diego.	David Eckstein had just grounded out in the bottom of the inning when the stadium began shaking. The next batter, Chase Headley, stayed out of the batter's box for a few seconds, then stepped in.	The public address announcer asked that everyone remain calm. The crowd cheered.	Most fans felt the quake. The right-field foul pole swayed back and forth, as did TVs in the press box. Some players, such as Blue Jays second baseman Aaron Hill, said they didn't feel it. Manager Cito Gaston said he felt the dugout move side-to-side.	"They happen so fast that there's nothing you can do," Gaston said.	John Buck homered twice and Hill had three doubles and three RBIs for the Blue Jays, who jumped all over Jon Garland when he started to struggle while pitching on three days' rest.	Buck hit a two-run shot off Garland in Toronto's four-run second, and a leadoff drive against Sean Gallagher in the eighth, giving him 11 this season. It was his eighth career multihomer game and third this season.	The Blue Jays had lost six of seven, a span in which they were outscored 41-13.	Hill hit a two-run double with two outs in the second to give the Blue Jays a 4-0 lead against Garland (6-5), who was pitching on short rest after starting the second game of a doubleheader at the New York Mets on Thursday night.	Garland threw 26 pitches in the first inning and 34 in the second. He allowed Lyle Overbay's single ahead of Buck's homer to left. He walked Marcum with two outs and allowed DeWayne Wise's double ahead of Hill's double to right.	Garland struck out seven and walked four, throwing 114 pitches in five innings. He was angry because he thought he had Marcum struck out on a 2-2 pitch in the second but umpire Larry Vanover called it a ball.	"It's upsetting. He called that pitch for me, then he didn't call it," Garland said. "Just be consistent. Larry Vanover was not consistent tonight.	"I still had a chance to get out of that inning, but I mentally lost it. I was frustrated, upset because I thought I did what I needed to do."	Marcum (6-3) allowed solo homers by Jerry Hairston Jr. and Adrian Gonzalez among his six hits in seven innings. He yielded three runs, two earned, while improving to 6-1 in eight starts after Blue Jays losses.	Marcum escaped a bases-loaded jam with no outs in the seventh, allowing just one run on a groundout by Tony Gwynn Jr.	"That was our chance," Padres manager Bud Black said. "Bases loaded, no outs, and we only got one run. A big hit, anywhere in there, would have proved to be a different ballgame."	Hairston homered off the balcony on the third level of the Western Metal Supply Co. brick warehouse in the left-field corner leading off the third, his fourth. Gonzalez hit an opposite-field shot to left leading off the fourth, his 15th.	Kevin Gregg pitched the ninth for his 16th save in 19 chances.	Hill also had an RBI double in the sixth.	Game notes	 Gaston said Blue Jays RHP Dustin McGowan, who has been sidelined since July 2008 because of shoulder surgery and a subsequent knee injury, heard a pop in his shoulder during a rehab outing on Sunday and was shut down after eight pitches. He had an MRI exam on Monday and the team should know the results on Tuesday. ... San Diego's Yorvit Torrealba was ejected in the ninth for arguing with umpire Larry Vanover after taking a called third strike. ... Black said SS Everth Cabrera, on the disabled list for the second time this season with a strained right hamstring, is likely to go out on a three-game minor league rehab assignment later this week.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Pat Burrell spent a couple weeks at home after he was cut by Tampa Bay last month. He wasn't sure about his future, so he's definitely enjoying his time with the San Francisco Giants.	Burrell homered for the second time in four days, Freddy Sanchez drove in four runs and San Francisco beat the Baltimore Orioles 10-2 on Monday night.	"It's hard to have a better game than what we put together tonight," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "We just had quality at-bat after quality at-bat."	Burrell hit a leadoff drive in San Francisco's five-run second inning, giving the Giants a 2-1 lead. Burrell, who also homered in a 6-2 victory over Oakland on Friday night, signed a minor league deal with San Francisco on May 29 and is batting .407 since he was promoted on June 4.	"I just kept telling myself, 'You still have something to offer.' For whatever reason the timing was right and it worked," said Burrell, who grew up near San Francisco and graduated from Bellarmine Prep in San Jose. "Not many guys get that kind of a chance so I'm trying to enjoy every minute of it."	Also in the second, Pablo Sandoval and Andres Torres had RBI doubles, Sanchez singled in a run and Aubrey Huff added a sacrifice fly that made it 5-1.	Jonathan Sanchez pitched 7 2/3 innings for the Giants, allowing two runs and eight hits. He struck out five and walked one in his third victory in four outings after a 2-4 start.	Matt Wieters hit a solo homer for the Orioles, who have lost 18 of 21. Baltimore also fell to 1-6 in interleague play this season.	"If we keep giving up so many runs early it makes it hard to fight back," Orioles interim manager Juan Samuel said. "We tie it up and the guys are feeling good, then we give up five runs right away. That's not going to do it."	San Francisco has won four straight to move a season-high nine games over .500 and pull within a half-game of NL West-leading San Diego, which lost 6-3 to Toronto.	Jonathan Sanchez (5-5) lowered his ERA to 2.78. The left-hander, who threw the Giants' first no-hitter in nearly 35 years last July, has allowed eight earned runs over his last five starts.	Sanchez left after surrendering a leadoff single to Corey Patterson in the eighth and a two-out RBI double to Ty Wigginton. Sergio Romo and Jeremy Affeldt completed the eight-hitter.	Coming off a 2-7 homestand, the Orioles failed to put together back-to-back hits and only two runners reached third base.	Wieters connected on a 3-2 pitch from Sanchez in the second, tying it at 1. The second-year catcher had gone 102 at-bats without a homer, matching the longest drought of his career.	It was Baltimore's third homer in its last 10 games.	Chris Tillman (0-3) gave up six runs and six hits over two innings in his first career start against San Francisco.	The Giants took a 1-0 lead in the first when Torres led off with a triple and scored on Freddy Sanchez's sacrifice fly.	Torres also drew a bases-loaded walk in the eighth, one of two issued in the inning by Frank Mata.	Game notes	 Orioles OF Felix Pie, on the DL with a strained left shoulder, will begin taking batting practice from coaches Tuesday and could rejoin the team before the end of the month. ... Bochy didn't rule out using Buster Posey at catcher when RHP Joe Martinez makes his 2010 debut on Tuesday. Posey, who has played first base in 15 of his 16 games since being called up from the minors, caught Martinez when the two played at Triple-A Fresno. ... Giants SS Edgar Renteria, on a minor league rehab assignment, will play when he returns to the big league club but not at the expense of INF Juan Uribe, who leads the team in RBIs and is tied with Huff for the lead in home runs. Uribe has started 39 games at shortstop this season. ... Baltimore SS Miguel Tejada's homerless streak is at 166 at-bats, the second-longest stretch of his career.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

CLEVELAND -- When Jose Reyes gave his third-base coach the runaround, the Cleveland Indians never had a chance.	Reyes ran through a stop signal from Chip Hale, racing around him to score from second base on an infield single to help Johan Santana and the New York Mets to a 7-6 win over the error-prone Indians on Tuesday night.	"They say speed kills and tonight it did," Reyes said of his nifty scamper that helped New York overcome a 4-1 deficit to earn its fifth consecutive win. The Mets are 10-2 in June.	"One thing we can bring every game is speed," Mets manager Jerry Manuel said. "When Reyes gets on, he can be disruptive. The top of our lineup can run and we like to use it."	Reyes was not about to deny Santana (5-3) enough run support.	The left-hander (5-3) won for the first time in four starts. The included two no-decisions when he didn't yield a run over 15 innings in consecutive outings. He gave up four runs and seven hits over seven innings and struck out only one, but earned his first win since beating the New York Yankees in another interleague game on May 23.	"It's always great to get runs," Santana said. "I made some mistakes early, but tried to stay aggressive. Then I threw strikes and tried to protect the lead."	Santana dominated Cleveland early in his career with the Minnesota Twins, but went 0-5 against them in his final year in the AL in 2007 before being dealt to New York. The two-time AL Cy Young winner is 8-7 against the Indians and beat them for the first time since Aug. 15, 2006.	"As soon as he got the lead, he turned it up a notch," Indians manager Manny Acta said. "That's what good pitchers do."	Francisco Rodriguez worked the ninth for his 14th save in 17 chances despite yielding a two-out, two-run pinch homer to Shelley Duncan.	New York overcame a 4-1 deficit with a five-run fifth off Justin Masterson (2-6), capped by Ike Davis' two-run homer.	The Mets kept bunting and the Indians handled the ball like a hot potato before Davis delivered.	"We ended up beating ourselves in that inning by not being able to make those plays," Acta said. "You've got to play defense. That inning cost us the game."	Jeff Francoeur singled and Alex Cora got a bunt single when nobody covered first as catcher Carlos Santana fielded the ball. Reyes then bunted for a single. Masterson fielded the ball and threw wildly to first, scoring Francoeur and sending runners to second and third.	"It was like everything kept getting worse," Masterson said. "It's just crazy, kind of a weird night."	One out later, David Wright beat out a single to shortstop Jason Donald. Cora scored on the throw to first and Reyes surprised everybody -- particularly Hale -- by racing home, too. Reyes ran around Hale and slid in just ahead of the low throw from first baseman Russell Branyan that temporarily popped away, too.	"I knew I could score before I got to third," Reyes said. "He tried to stop me. I went on my own. I knew I had better make it."	Davis even attempted a bunt -- against a shift that had only one infielder on the third-base side, but the ball rolled just foul. The rookie then hammered his eighth homer over the centerfield fence to make it 6-4.	"That attempt shows what an unselfish ballplayer Ike is," Manuel said. "But it always appears as if his home runs are big home runs, too"	Davis was surprised Cleveland shifted, calling himself a gap-to-gap hitter.	"That was my second attempt in my life, I think," he said. "The shift takes some things away, but opens other opportunities, so I tried it.	"On the homer, I wasn't sure it was going out. It just kept going, though."	Travis Hafner started the Indians' three-run second with his fourth homer in six games, eighth this year, and fifth of his career off Santana. Trevor Crowe's two-out, two-run single made it 3-1.	Reyes opened the game with a walk, stole second and moved up on a groundout. He scored on an infield single by Wright.	Jhonny Peralta drew an 11-pitch walk in the Indians fourth. The slow-footed Indians third baseman, with nine steals in 891 career games, took off before the next pitch and Santana threw to first for an apparent easy pickoff. Second-base umpire Doug Eddings ruled it a balk, putting Peralta on second. Peralta took third on a groundout and scored on a single by Jason Donald to make it 4-1.	Masterson gave up 10 hits and six earned runs over seven innings. The right-hander threw a two-hit shutout against Boston in his previous start for his second straight win after going 0-11 in 17 starts since August.	Game notes	 New York has won 16 of 21. ... Mets RHP John Maine (shoulder) will start at Triple-A Buffalo on Friday, his second rebab appearance. ... Mets 2B Luis Castillo (bruised right heel) and OF Carlos Beltran (right knee surgery) are rehabbing at the team's spring training facility in Port St. Lucie, Fla. There is no timetable for a return by Beltran, who has been out all season. ... Peralta went 1 for 2 with a walk off Santana. He is 4 of 28 (.143) with 22 strikeouts against him. ... Wright has hit .453 (24 of 53) with 16 RBIs over his last 14 games.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.	Jhoulys Chacín has agreed to a guaranteed $1.25 million, one-year contract with the Rockies.	The Milwaukee Brewers acquired infielder Mike Brosseau from the Tampa Bay Rays for minor league pitcher Evan Reifert on Saturday in a trade between division winners.	After Mookie Betts rolls a 300 in the final qualifying round of the World Series of Bowling in Reno, Nevada, Betts discusses how his approach is similar in baseball.	Los Angeles Dodgers lefty Andrew Heaney is confident he will improve in 2022 based on numbers other than his combined 8-9 record and 5.83 ERA last season.

DETROIT -- Jim Leyland never believed that Ryan Raburn had forgotten how to hit.	On Tuesday night, Detroit got an indication that he was right.	Raburn, who came into the game hitting .165, had two hits and drove in four runs, including a tiebreaking three-run homer in the fifth inning as the Tigers went on to their fourth straight win, 7-4 over the Washington Nationals.	"Tonight was more like the Raburn we saw last year," Leyland said. "He's been pressing, but he had 16 homers last year, so we know he has some power."	Raburn's prolonged slump had caused him to lose his starting job to rookie Brennan Boesch. He was in the lineup Tuesday only because center fielder Austin Jackson was sidelined with back spasms, but he got a pregame tip from Tigers hitting coach Lloyd McClendon.	"Mac said he saw something -- my hips have been flying out, and I needed to stay closed," Raburn said. "We made a little adjustment, and it felt great."	Raburn drew a bases-loaded walk in the second inning, then hit a leadoff single that started a two-run fourth to tie the game at 4 before hitting his first homer of the year in the next inning.	"That was huge," he said. "It's about time that I helped win us a game. I've been waiting to do that all year, and it felt great."	Magglio Ordonez returned to the Detroit lineup and tied a career high with four hits. He had missed the Tigers' previous six games with a strain in his side.	Max Scherzer (3-6) struck out nine in six innings. He allowed three earned runs and seven hits.	"It feels really good around here, because this four-game winning streak is what we needed to get back toward first place," Scherzer said. "This has been at home, but usually when you do good things at home, they translate to the road."	Jose Valverde picked up his 14th save with a scoreless ninth.	John Lannan (2-4) took the loss, giving up six earned runs in 4 1/3 innings. In his past two starts, Lannan has allowed 12 runs in nine innings.	"I just couldn't get into any kind of rhythm, and that's twice in a row now," Lannan said. "I feel fine. I don't know what's going on."	Washington manager Jim Riggleman didn't think the two games had much in common.	"In his last start, Pittsburgh was able to lay off his good sinker and make him throw something else," he said. "Tonight, he wasn't getting anything to sink at all. That's not something we see often from him."	Nyjer Morgan manufactured the game's first run. With one out in the Nationals first, he reached on a bunt single, stole second and continued to third on catcher Gerald Laird's throwing error, then scored on Ryan Zimmerman's sacrifice fly to shallow right field.	"All season, catchers have been making perfect throws whenever Nyjer runs, but he finally got a break tonight," Riggleman said. "Laird can throw, and if he gets it on target, Nyjer's out, but the ball gets away, and we get an extra base out of it."	The Nationals got two more runs in the third on RBI singles by Josh Willingham and former Tiger Ivan Rodriguez.	The Tigers made it 3-2 in the bottom half when Miguel Cabrera beat the throw home on a grounder to first.	Mike Morse hit a leadoff homer in the Nationals fourth. Detroit tied it in its half of the fourth when Ordonez hit an RBI double and later scored on Carlos Guillen's sacrifice fly.	Laird led off the fifth with a single, and Danny Worth reached on second baseman Cristian Guzman's error before Raburn's first homer since Oct. 4.	"I wasn't rattled by the error -- I was focused on getting us out of the inning," Lannan said. "Instead, I made a terrible pitch."	Game notes	 The game was Washington's first in Detroit since the franchise moved from Montreal. The Expos played their only series at Comerica Park in June 2002. ... Rodriguez, making his second appearance in Detroit since being traded in 2008, received loud cheers from the crowd of 24,821 during his first at-bat. ... Jackson, who injured himself in the first inning of Sunday's win over the Pirates, is day to day with the back problem.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

NEW YORK -- Even after adding Roy Halladay, the Philadelphia Phillies can't seem to stop that New York Yankees lineup.	Nick Swisher and the Yankees handed Halladay a rare thumping, beating Philadelphia and its new ace 8-3 Tuesday night in a World Series rematch.	"We had a great approach," Swisher said. "We did a good job of getting him up in the zone and getting him on the plate."	Mark Teixeira, Curtis Granderson and Swisher all homered off Halladay to build a comfortable cushion for CC Sabathia in a marquee pitching matchup that fizzled early.	Brett Gardner laced a two-run triple in the second inning and the Yankees, still missing injured slugger Alex Rodriguez (groin), won their ninth straight home game -- the club's best streak in its second-year ballpark.	"We've got a lot of depth from top to bottom," Gardner said. "No matter the lineup we throw out there and no matter who's on the mound for us, we feel like we have the best team."	Coming off a three-game sweep of Houston, New York, which began the day tied with Tampa Bay for the AL East lead, moved a season-best 18 games over .500 at 41-23 with its seventh victory in eight games.	This one came against the slumping Phillies, the two-time defending NL champions who were beaten in six games by the Yankees during last year's World Series. Philadelphia responded by trading for Halladay in December, putting one of baseball's best arms at the top of its rotation.	The 2003 AL Cy Young Award winner with Toronto, Halladay has pitched extremely well for his new team -- even tossing a perfect game. But the Phillies are stuck in a surprising slide anyway.	Missing star shortstop Jimmy Rollins and a pair of key pitchers to injuries, they've dropped 15 of 21 while falling to third place in the NL East. The last time the Phillies were in New York, they were shut out in three straight games by the Mets from May 25-27.	"Everybody's concerned. You have to be. But you can't let that affect how you play going forward," Halladay said.	Sabathia (7-3) became the latest pitcher to stifle Philadelphia's previously powerful lineup. He went seven innings, allowing five hits and striking out seven while winning his third consecutive start. It was his first victory against a team other than Baltimore since he beat Texas on April 16.	The big left-hander is 4-0 against the last-place Orioles this season and 3-3 against everyone else. But he's 9-0 in his past 13 starts at Yankee Stadium since last year's All-Star break.	Making his third start since his perfect game at Florida on May 29, Halladay (8-5) matched a career high by serving up three homers -- the same number he allowed in his first 13 outings with Philadelphia.	"I knew I was missing, and I didn't get away with many of them," Halladay said. "It was just one of those games where you feel like you're grinding all the time and it takes a toll on you mentally."	It was the ninth time Halladay has yielded three homers in a game. The past three, and four of the past five, have come against the Yankees, according to STATS LLC.	"We've faced him a good bit. We know what to expect," Gardner said. "He pounds the zone and tonight he left some pitches over the middle of the plate and we were able to take advantage of it."	Swisher singled in the second, Jorge Posada walked and Gardner drove in both with a line drive that rolled all the way to the wall in right-center.	Granderson homered leading off the third and Robinson Cano doubled with one out. That meant the Yankees hit for the cycle in a span of nine batters against Halladay.	Swisher followed with his 11th home run on a 2-0 pitch, making it 5-0 before a rowdy crowd of 47,135.	"I saw a lot of people leaving in handcuffs today," Granderson said.	Philadelphia scored three times in the fourth, then left the bases loaded in the fifth. In the bottom half, Teixeira hit a high fly that landed just beyond the 314-foot sign in the right-field corner for a solo shot.	Halladay allowed six runs and eight hits in six innings, dropping to 2-4 in his past six starts and 18-7 against the Yankees overall. He is 1-2 in matchups with Sabathia, who is 2-1 in those games.	Francisco Cervelli greeted reliever David Herndon with a two-run single in the seventh, making him 6-for-8 with 13 RBIs with the bases loaded this season. All those at-bats have come with two outs.	"I don't know why we're not hitting as well as we can," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said. "Winning is hard -- way harder than people think it is."	Game notes	 Philadelphia flip-flopped starters for the final two games of the series. LHP Jamie Moyer will now pitch Wednesday night instead of Thursday. RHP Kyle Kendrick goes in the finale. ... Yankees RHP Chan Ho Park, who spent last season with the Phillies, appreciated receiving his 2009 NL championship ring from Philadelphia general manager Ruben Amaro Jr. before the game.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PITTSBURGH -- The White Sox are finding a way to focus the attention away from constantly feuding manager Ozzie Guillen and general manager Kenny Williams. Namely, win some games.	Gordon Beckham drove in three runs and the White Sox spoiled former first-round draft pick Brad Lincoln's first start at home, beating Pittsburgh 6-4 Tuesday night and extending the last-place Pirates' losing streak to nine games.	Ramon Castro doubled in a run while reaching base four consecutive times and the White Sox bullpen pitched 3 1/3 shutout innings following Freddy Garcia's uneven start. Chicago won its fifth in six games and sixth in eight games.	Williams is making his first road trip of the season, and Guillen said the two -- who often disagree over personnel matters and other issues, including the recent drafting of Guillen's son -- had a constructive talk during the flight to Pittsburgh.	"We've started playing really well this past week and getting hot and playing better baseball," Garcia said.	The Pirates, losers of 10 of 11 and 15 of 18, have plenty of problems while they're stuck in their longest losing streak since they also dropped nine straight from Aug. 28-Sept. 5. Maybe that's why they're calling up top prospect Pedro Alvarez, a third baseman and the No. 2 pick in the June 2008 draft, for Wednesday night's game.	"It will be a big boost for the ballclub," manager John Russell said.	Andrew McCutchen tried to provide one, matching his career high with three stolen bases and getting three hits and a walk. Ahead 5-4, Chicago was so preoccupied with McCutchen after he singled in the seventh, reliever Matt Thornton made 14 pickoff throws to first in a span of two batters to try to prevent him from stealing second -- which McCutchen eventually did, although he didn't score.	The Pirates tied it at 4 in the fifth after McCutchen singled in a run before stealing second and third on successive pitches and coming home on Ryan Doumit's two-out single.	Lincoln (0-1) followed up a 7-5 Pirates loss to Washington in his major league debut on Wednesday by again allowing five runs in six innings. The Pirates' top pick in 2006 twice created runs by walking the leadoff batter, and he walked three overall, hit two batters and allowed six hits.	"The leadoff walks hurt me and I've got to be able to shut teams down when we either take the lead or tie the game," Lincoln said. "I can't overdo anything or try to make a pitch better. Sometimes I left my curveball up because I was in too big of a rush to the plate. I've got to learn to slow down."	Garcia (7-3) was only slightly more effective -- he gave up eight hits and four runs in 5 2/3 innings -- but won his fourth in a run when Beckham singled in the go-ahead run in the sixth.	In the second, Castro's double preceded the light-hitting Beckham's RBI grounder that tied it at 2. Beckham, who came in batting .204, followed Castro's leadoff walk with a run-scoring double in fourth and scored on Juan Pierre's perfectly executed suicide squeeze bunt to make it 4-2.	The suicide squeeze is rarely seen these days, which might be why the unconventional Guillen called for it.	"That's Ozzie for you," Pierre said. "You've always got to be heads up with him. When guys get on, he likes to get things going. You don't ever see that, so it was a good time to use it."	Bobby Jenks finished up in the ninth for his 12th save in 13 opportunities despite giving up McCutchen's third hit in as many at-bats. Thornton and J.J. Putz pitched a scoreless inning each, and Sergio Santos struck out Neil Walker in the sixth with runners on second and third.	"The bullpen's gotten fresh. It's gotten stronger," Guillen said. "When our pitching staff is doing well -- and I said that at the beginning of the season -- our bullpen will be very, very effective."	Alex Rios' run-scoring single gave Chicago an insurance run in the top of the ninth after reliever Octavio Dotel walked Juan Pierre, then threw wildly for a two-base error on a pickoff attempt.	Game notes	 Former White Sox reliever D.J. Carrasco struck out three during two scoreless relief innings. ... Steelers coach Mike Tomlin attended, wearing a Pirates jersey. ... The White Sox are 5-2 in interleague play, the Pirates are 0-4.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

BOSTON -- David Ortiz's first-inning homer helped the Red Sox open a big early lead and gave the Boston fans a chance to watch the Celtics in the NBA Finals.	Clay Buchholz didn't mind it, either.	"That's big, going out to a three- or four-run cushion," the Red Sox right-hander said Tuesday night after pitching Boston to a 6-3 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks.	"He's a key to the success of this team. Whenever that guy's hitting, it's just a different lineup."	Buchholz (9-4) allowed three runs on seven hits and a walk, striking out eight in 5 2/3 innings for his sixth win in seven starts. Jonathan Papelbon pitched the ninth to earn his 14th save and send the Diamondbacks to their 11th straight road loss.	Ian Kennedy (3-4) gave up six runs on nine hits and a walk, striking out six in six innings while also throwing two wild pitches and hitting a batter. He is 0-3 with two no-decisions since May 19.	"I don't know if he was pitching away from the Monster or if he was trying to be fine when he was going away from these guys," Diamondbacks manager A.J. Hinch said. "When they get their arms extended, it's pretty lethal."	Dustin Pedroia, who batted .213 in May, had a pair of hits and scored three runs. He is batting .310 in June, with multiple hits in four of his last five games.	"That's the last guy I worry about," Ortiz said.	Pedroia was hit by a pitch in the first inning, and Ortiz followed with his first homer since June 2 -- his 13th of the season. In the third, Pedroia doubled in a run, Daniel Nava scored on a wild pitch and then Pedroia scored to make it 5-1 on an infield single by Victor Martinez that resulted in a close play for first base umpire Jim Joyce.	Replays showed he was right.	The Fenway Park crowd began a "Beat L.A.!" chant right around tipoff time for the Game 6 of the NBA finals between the Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers. It was 6-3 in the fifth when empty seats began appearing, and most of those in the luxury seats cleared out as fans left or went inside to watch TV.	It also helped calm down Buchholz.	"It's a good way to play," Red Sox manager Terry Francona said. "When your pitching's holding them down, every time you score after that [helps]."	Arizona scored two in the fourth to make it 6-3 when Miguel Montero doubled and took third on Chris Young's single. Young stole second, and they both scored on Justin Upton's double.	But Pedroia singled to lead off the bottom of the fifth, moved up on a groundout and scored on Kevin Youkilis' double.	"After the fourth, we didn't do much after that," Hinch said. "[Buchholz] settled in and made pitches. He lasted long enough to hand the ball to their bullpen and they completely shut us down."	Youkilis let Montero's first-inning grounder go through his legs at first base -- his first error of the season and first at first base since April 8 of last year.	But he also made two nice plays to field grounders to his right in the second inning, tossing to Buchholz at the bag for a 3-1 putout reminiscent of Joyce's blown call that cost Detroit's Armando Galarraga a perfect game. Neither one was as close as Martinez's infield hit on a grounder to shortstop in the third inning.	Game notes	 The Diamondbacks traded OF Conor Jackson to Oakland for minor league closer Sam Demel. Demel will report to the team in Boston on Wednesday, and the team will need to make another roster move then. ... Red Sox SS Marco Scutaro received a cortisone injection in the side of his neck on Monday to ease pains in his neck as well as elbow trouble. Scutaro wanted to play on Tuesday, but the Red Sox gave him another day to rest. ... Martinez, a native of Venezuela, was watching the Brazil World Cup match before the game, wearing a team shirt and colorful hat. ... Brothers J.D. and Stephen Drew faced each other for the 16th time.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ATLANTA -- David Price kept getting into trouble. No problem.	Carl Crawford fell face-first on the wet grass while rounding third. That worked out just fine, too.	Price became the AL's first 10-game winner, Evan Longoria hit a two-run homer and Crawford picked himself up to lead the Tampa Bay Rays to a 10-4 victory Tuesday night over the Atlanta Braves, who learned that longtime star Chipper Jones is considering retirement.	After a rain delay of nearly 2 1/2 hours at the start, a throwing error led to three unearned runs in a four-run first that sent Kenshin Kawakami (0-9) to another loss. He became the first starting pitcher in Braves franchise history to begin a season with nine straight defeats.	Price (10-2) was hardly dominating, lasting only five innings and throwing 113 pitches. But he got out of numerous jams, including striking out Brooks Conrad with two runners aboard on his final pitch of the night.	"I've had a rough stretch," he said. "I'm throwing the ball well. It's just not going where I want it to go."	The Braves had plenty of chances to bounce back after falling behind in a game that started late because of storms and didn't end until 1 a.m. But they failed to take advantage of a bases-loaded, no-outs situation in the second and wound up leaving 14 runners on base -- at least one in every inning but the ninth.	Tampa Bay stayed tied for first with the New York Yankees, who beat Philadelphia 8-3. The Braves' lead in the NL East fell to just a half-game over the other New York team; the Mets beat Cleveland 7-6.	The Rays put the game out of reach with two runs in the sixth -- including Crawford scoring even with his tumble between third and home -- and three more in the seventh off Chris Resop, who had a rough debut with the Braves after being called up from Triple-A earlier in the day.	After falling, the speedy Crawford hopped right up and managed to slide around catcher Brian McCann's attempted tag, after the throw from left fielder Melky Cabrera was up the third-base line.	"I just lost my footing," Crawford said. "He's wasn't blocking the plate."	McCann didn't have a chance to, darting out to his left to catch the throw, then trying to run back in time to get Crawford with a diving tag.	It wasn't a fair matchup.	"I'm not that quick," McCann said. "When I caught it, I knew it was going to be a foot race -- and I probably wasn't going to win it."	The Braves' day began with Jones saying that he's considering retirement at the end of another disappointing season. He met with team officials before the game and indicated that an official announcement could be coming soon.	But the 38-year-old Jones showed he's still got some pop in his bat. He doubled and scored in the third, then hit a solo homer into the center-field seats in the eighth.	"Home runs always make you feel better," said Jones, accompanied by his parents after the game.	The Rays did most of the scoring right from the start. With one out in the first, Crawford reached when shortstop Yunel Escobar's throw pulled first baseman Troy Glaus off the bag. Longoria followed with a towering drive into the left-field seats for his 12th homer. Cabrera barely moved on the play, other than turning to watch it land about halfway up in the lower desk.	Kawakami struck out Carlos Pena, but Ben Zobrist walked, B.J. Upton doubled and Sean Rodriguez brought them both home with a double just inside the third-base bag, extending his hitting streak to 15 games.	Kawakami went five innings, giving up seven hits and walking three. He was charged with five runs, but only two were earned. That didn't lessen the sting of another loss and further endanger his spot in the rotation, especially if Jair Jurrjens comes off the disabled list as expected in about two weeks.	"He's pitched so much better than his record," McCann said. "He's kept us in a ton of games."	Zobrist had a two-run single in the sixth, while Longoria added a run-scoring double in the seventh to give him three RBIs on the night.	"That whole game was a trip," Rays manager Joe Maddon said. "We had baserunners all day."	Game notes	 Resop was recalled from Triple-A Gwinnett after going 5-2 with a 1.84 ERA in 13 starts. The Braves farmed out struggling reliever Jesse Chavez, who was 0-1 with a 7.33 ERA in 18 games. ... Crawford reached base five times on two hits, two walks and Escobar's errant throw.

CINCINNATI -- Rafael Furcal had five hits, made a couple of nice plays in the field and pretty much did everything he could.	Except get six hits. He grounded out in the ninth.	"In a game like this, you want to take advantage," Furcal said. "You never know about the next game. You could go 0 for 5."	Manny Ramirez contributed with a homer four RBIs to help the Dodgers snap a three-game losing streak with a 12-0 win over the Cincinnati Reds on Tuesday night.	James Loney also had four hits to help the Dodgers finish with more runs than the eight they scored while being swept by the Los Angeles Angels in a three-game weekend series at Dodger Stadium.	A long rain delay obviously didn't bother Furcal, who was playing his 20th game since returning from the disabled list after pulling a hamstring.	"As soon as they said the game would start in a half hour, we started to stretch and move around," Furcal said. "I'm feeling better the last four or five days. The first week and a half when I came back, I was a little sore, but it's gone now. I feel like I do at the start of the season now."	The Reds, who spent the previous six days alone in first place in the NL Central Division, lost for the third time in four games and dropped into a tie with St. Louis after the Cardinals beat Seattle 4-2.	The Dodgers, who have scored 40 runs in four games at Great American Ball Park this season, tied a season high with 19 hits.	"They blew us out," Reds manager Dusty Baker said. "They got hit after hit after hit. That was not a good night for us tonight -- a long game and a drubbing to boot."	Hiroki Kuroda outlasted a rain delay of 2 hours, 24 minutes to win for the first time in four starts since beating Houston 7-3 on May 18.	Kuroda (6-4) allowed three hits with two walks and five strikeouts while picking up his third win in three career starts against Cincinnati.	"I felt good," Kuroda said. "I wanted to go back out there. I wanted to go all the way today. I have never waited this long. Generally, in Japan, they wait an hour. If it doesn't stop raining, they cancel the game. If I didn't go back out there, I thought my whole day would be wasted. I played catch with the bullpen coach three times during the delay."	Cincinnati starter Aaron Harang did not return after rain forced a delay with one out in the top of the fifth inning. Harang (5-6), who'd won his last three decisions, gave up seven hits and five runs with two walks and five strikeouts.	Furcal's double in the first sparked a three-run inning and the Dodgers added three more in the fifth after the delay on RBI singles by Ramirez, Loney and Casey Blake before Ramirez hit a two-run shot in the seventh.	Ramon Troncoso drew a bases-loaded walk for his first career RBI and Furcal drove in two runs with a line drive off the left field wall that went for a single when Troncoso stopped at second.	"Furcal was the star of the game," manager Joe Torre said. "He did everything but sell tickets."	Game notes	 The rain delay was the Reds' first of the season in Cincinnati in 38 games. ... The Reds recalled RHP Jordan Smith from Double-A Carolina and optioned RHP Enerio Del Rosario to Triple-A Louisville before the game. Smith, who's never pitched above the Double-A level in five professional seasons, was 1/3 with a 5.08 ERA in 27 relief appearances for the Mudcats. In two stints with the Reds this season, Del Rosario was 1-1 with a 2.08 ERA in nine games. ...
