WASHINGTON --  Bryce Harper sat out after a procedure to fix an ingrown toenail. Jayson Werth has been sidelined for a week with a bad hamstring and the plan is to put him on the disabled list.	So what if two of Washington's best hitters watched from the dugout Friday night? With extra-base hits coming from lower in the order, the Nationals extended their season-high winning streak to five games.	Ian Desmond's three hits included a two-run homer and an RBI double, and Danny Espinosa and Kurt Suzuki each drove in a pair of runs with a double, helping Washington beat the Chicago Cubs 7-3 for its seventh victory in the past eight games.	"When your 3-hole hitter's out of there," Washington manager Davey Johnson said, referring to Harper, "and you score a bunch of runs, that's big."	Desmond was reminded of the manner in which the Nationals compiled a majors-best 98 wins in 2012 despite a series of injuries to everyday players.	"Last year, we were missing guys throughout the whole season, pretty much," said Desmond, who singled and scored in the second, homered in the fourth and doubled in the fifth. "We just found a way."	Ross Detwiler (2-3) gave up two runs in 6 2/3 innings, and Craig Stammen got the last seven outs.	"He wasn't real happy when I hooked him," Johnson said about Detwiler. "That's good. I like that."	Chicago's Jeff Samardzija (1-5) lost his fifth decision in a row by allowing seven runs -- five earned -- and eight hits. He threw 73 pitches in his five innings, matching his shortest outing of the season.	Samardzija said he was not bothered by a cut on his right index finger from a start April 24.	"Felt good. Felt about as best as I could all year," the right-hander said. "That's the frustrating part of it, when you've got your pitches and you feel good and you get that outcome."	Making his first start in the leadoff slot this season, Chicago's Starlin Castro delivered doubles in each of his first two at-bats, including to begin the game. He made it 1-0 in the first on Anthony Rizzo's groundout.	Suzuki's two-run double off the wall in right-center put Washington ahead 2-1 in the second.	"I never complain about getting hits. My defense is my priority, but it definitely feels good," said Suzuki, a catcher. "Being in the bottom of the lineup, when guys are out there, you just want to drive them in."	One of the runners who scored reached on an infield single, while the other got aboard when Samardzija failed in two attempts to start a double play by fielding the ball with his pitching hand and was charged with an error -- making both runs unearned.	"That was kind of the big mess," Cubs manager Dale Sveum said. "We've got to field a ground ball back to us. We seem to make a mistake, and we can't make a pitch after that."	Chicago tied it in the third when Samardzija and Castro hit consecutive doubles. Castro later was thrown out at home when trying to score on Rizzo's single. Right fielder Roger Bernadina, starting because Harper and Werth were out, got his second assist of the season with his throw, and Suzuki dived to tag Castro.	Desmond put Washington back out front with his fifth homer, driving an 0-1 pitch barely over the wall in left to make it 4-2. Soon as the bat made contact with the ball, Samardzija spun around and yelled.	Things didn't get much better in the fifth, when the Nationals tacked on three more runs on consecutive doubles by Desmond and Espinosa.	"They're due," Johnson said, "to start doing their thing."	Game notes	 Samardzija's lone win came on Opening Day against Pittsburgh. ... Nationals GM Mike Rizzo said Werth has a "very slight strain" of his hamstring and the move to the DL would be backdated to May 2. Rizzo expects Werth to be able to return the first day he's eligible, May 18. Johnson indicated Eury Perez will be called up from Triple-A Syracuse. ... Harper tweeted a photo of his bloody right big toe. Rizzo and Johnson both said they expect Harper to be available Saturday. ... The Cubs activated RHP Kyuji Fujikawa from the DL and optioned RHP Rafael Dolis to Triple-A Iowa. Fujikawa, out since April 13 with a straight right forearm, pitched a scoreless seventh inning Friday. ... On Saturday, Nationals RHP Stephen Strasburg (1-4, 3.45 ERA) will face Cubs RHP Edwin Jackson (0-5, 6.39). Jackson was with Washington last season, then signed a $52 million, four-year deal with the Cubs as a free agent. "Been a slow start to say the least. Not exactly how I had it envisioned," Jackson said.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

DETROIT -- Before the game Friday, Jim Leyland called Miguel Cabrera and Prince Fielder the best 3-4 combination in the lineup he's ever had.	The veteran manager's timing was perfect.	Cabrera and Fielder each hit a long home run later that night, and the Detroit Tigers beat the Cleveland Indians 10-4. Fielder's third-inning solo shot landed near the No. 42 honoring Jackie Robinson on the brick facade beyond the wall in right-center field. Cabrera's three-run homer the following inning came down below Hank Greenberg's retired No. 5 in left-center at Comerica Park.	"I just kind of let 'em play, stay out of their way. ... I think that's what you're supposed to do," Leyland said. "We're very fortunate, obviously, to have both of them."	Detroit's Max Scherzer (5-0) allowed four runs and five hits in eight innings. He struck out seven without a walk.	Corey Kluber (2-2) allowed eight runs and 11 hits in 4 2/3 innings.	Andy Dirks also homered for the Tigers, and Omar Infante had three hits, including two doubles. Jhonny Peralta doubled twice as well.	The Tigers trailed 1-0 before Alex Avila's two-run double in the second. Torii Hunter drove home Avila with a single to right, although he was tagged out near first base on the throw back to the infield for the last out of the inning -- preventing another run from scoring on the play.	Fielder's homer went an estimated 460 feet -- according to a Tigers' spokesman, who cited ESPN Stats & Info.	"That was unbelievable," Cabrera said. "Every time he goes to the plate, it's like we expect he's going to hit the ball so far, because we know what kind of power he has."	The Indians answered with a run in the fourth when Nick Swisher tripled and scored on Carlos Santana's groundout.	Detroit broke the game open in the bottom half. With one out, Infante hit his second double of the game and took third on Austin Jackson's single. After Hunter struck out, Cabrera hit his seventh homer of the year. The defending Triple Crown winner has 40 RBIs in 33 games in 2013.	"When you get RBIs, that means people are on base, obviously," Leyland said. "We've done a good job of that for him, and he's taken advantage of that."	Avila had three RBIs on Friday -- his fifth-inning single scored Peralta to make it 8-2.	"I made too many mistakes with the cutter," Kluber said. "I left one over the plate to Cabrera, and they got a couple more hits off that exact same pitch."	Scherzer's previous start was Detroit's 17-2 victory over Houston last weekend. He received plenty of support this time, too, and he retired eight in a row after Swisher's triple.	"That's one of the best pitchers in the game, and we got four runs off him, so that's pretty good," Indians manager Terry Francona said. "He just pounds the strike zone and then he's got the wipe-out changeup, so you aren't going to get much off him without scratching and clawing. I wish we had gotten 10 off him, but that's not too likely."	Cleveland, which entered the day with a major league-leading 49 homers, didn't hit any Friday. The Indians did scratch out a couple runs in the seventh on an RBI groundout by Mark Reynolds and a sacrifice fly by Michael Brantley.	Dirks hit a solo homer down the line in right in the bottom of the seventh to make it 9-4, and Victor Martinez hit a run-scoring single in the eighth.	Scherzer threw 103 pitches. He has never thrown a complete game. ... The Tigers have won 29 of their last 37 games against Cleveland at Comerica. ... Avila was only able to advance from second to third on Infante's bloop double in the second -- second baseman Jason Kipnis almost caught the ball, so Avila had to stay near second. ... Detroit ace Justin Verlander (4-2) faces Cleveland's Ubaldo Jimenez (2-2) on Saturday night.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BOSTON --  Jon Lester was inducing Toronto's aggressive batters to make outs by getting them to swing at first pitches -- until Macier Izturis came up in the sixth.	First pitch. Two-out double to left field. End of bid for perfect game and no-hitter.	But Izturis was the only Blue Jay to reach base as the Boston Red Sox broke a three-game losing streak with a 5-0 win on Friday night.	"The no-hitter, perfect game, all that stuff, the stars got to be perfectly aligned for you," Lester said.	He should know.	Lester (5-0) threw a no-hitter on May 19, 2008, beating the Kansas City Royals 7-0. Just nine days shy of the fifth anniversary of that gem, the left-hander retired the first 17 batters before Izturis lined a clean double several feet over the outstretched arm of third baseman Will Middlebrooks that landed just inside the foul line. Lester then ended the inning by striking out pinch-hitter Adam Lind.	"If that ball's two feet to (the) left, it's right at him," Lester said. "Good pitch, what we wanted to throw especially to an aggressive hitter. He did a good job of hitting it."	Catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia could have a tough time forgetting it.	"As soon as the game was over I started thinking about it," he said. "Changeup, first pitch. I'm going to have nightmares about it to be honest with you."	The closest the Blue Jays came to another hit was Brett Lawrie's low liner starting the sixth that center fielder Jacoby Ellsbury caught easily.	"He was throwing everything," Toronto's J.P. Arencibia said. "I think he used our aggressiveness against us a little bit. He's pretty special when you could throw cutter, sinker, four-seam, hook, changeup, and on both sides of the plate. The guy's one of the best in the game for a reason. He showed that tonight."	Lester wasn't the only pitcher to give up only one hit Friday. St. Louis' Shelby Miller gave up a leadoff single then retired 27 in a row in a 3-0 victory over Colorado.	Lester finished with five strikeouts in the 10th complete game and third shutout of his career, effectively mixing his pitches and locating them precisely. He threw just 118 pitches -- only 58 in the first five innings -- and retired the first batter in each of the first three innings on one pitch apiece.	"We've always seen him good. He's one of the better ones in the game," Toronto manager John Gibbons said. "He carved us up pretty good tonight."	But the Red Sox led only 1-0 before scoring four runs in the seventh.	"In the seventh we were able to bunch some hits together, which was kind of elusive," Boston manager John Farrell said.	Boston continued to waste numerous opportunities. It left runners on base in each of the first seven innings after stranding runners in all nine innings of Thursday night's 5-3 win over the Minnesota Twins.	They scored in the second against Ramon Ortiz (0-1) when Daniel Nava walked, took third on a single by Saltalamacchia and scored when shortstop Izturis fielded Middlebrooks' grounder but his throw to start a potential inning-ending double play eluded second baseman Mark DeRosa.	The Red Sox finally built a comfortable lead in the seventh.	Singles by Ellsbury and Shane Victorino put runners at first and second and they moved up on a wild pitch by Brett Cecil. Dustin Pedroia singled in a run, but the next two batters struck out. Then Saltalamacchia doubled in two runs and Middlebrooks drove in another with his second double of the game.	Friday's outing was the fourth time Lester allowed just one hit while pitching at least seven innings -- and the third time against Toronto.	The other two were over eight innings in a 1-0 win in Boston on April 29, 2008, and seven innings in a 2-0 win at Toronto on April 28, 2010. He also did it against Kansas City in eight innings of a 1-0 win on July 18, 2006.	Then there was the no-hitter in his first full season when he relied on veteran catcher Jason Varitek to tell him what to throw.	"I feel like back then (I was) such a thrower, not really a pitcher. I think the best way to put it is, effectively wild for my no-hitter," Lester said. "Now, obviously going through this a couple of times and (I'm) a little bit more mature and understanding what I'm trying to do."	And that made his catcher's job simpler.	"My job was easy. I put the glove there and he hit it," Saltalamacchia said. "I don't think whoever we were facing could have hit him."	Game notes	 The last Red Sox pitcher to allow one runner in a complete game was Josh Beckett in a one-hitter at Tampa Bay on June 15, 2011. ... Toronto designated hitter Rajai Davis left the game with a left oblique strain. Lind pinch hit for him in the sixth. ... Clay Buchholz (6-0) pitches for Boston against Mark Buehrle (1-2) in the second game of the three-game series Saturday. ... Toronto's six-game winning streak at Fenway ended.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

CINCINNATI --  Brandon Phillips homered and made a spectacular rally-busting play -- using his left knee to get a forceout and start a double play -- as the Cincinnati Reds beat the Milwaukee Brewers 4-3 on Friday night.	Phillips had an RBI single off Yovani Gallardo (3-2) and added a solo homer in the seventh after making a saving play in the top of the inning. With two Brewers aboard, he got to Ryan Braun's grounder up the middle, tagged second base with his left knee while falling down and threw to first for a double play.	The Reds won for the fifth time in seven games. Cincinnati is 14-6 at Great American Ball Park, the most home wins in the majors.	Milwaukee got solo homers from Jean Segura and Braun, but lost for the seventh time in eight games.	Alfredo Simon (3-1) threw two innings in relief of rookie left-hander Tony Cingrani. Aroldis Chapman gave up a run on a wild pitch in the ninth while getting his eighth save in as many chances.	Carlos Gomez went 0-for-4 and grounded into a double play, ending his hitting streak at a career-best 14 games.	Neither Gallardo nor Cingrani lasted more than four innings on a wet night, testing both bullpens' depth. Both were stingy, but Cincinnati's had a one-run lead to hold. Reds relievers allowed three hits and four walks in five innings.	The Brewers gave up eight hits and nine walks.	The Reds pulled ahead 2-0 in the third on Phillips' two-out RBI single and Jay Bruce's double off the glove of Norichika Aoki in right field. Bruce improved to .419 against Gallardo.	Zack Cozart's RBI single in the fourth put the Reds up 3-2. Gallardo gave up five hits and five walks in his four innings, throwing 100 pitches.	Cingrani has relied on his fastball to retire batters, getting a lot of strikeouts while piling up high pitch counts. He's also given up a lot of homers -- six in five starts, tied with Bronson Arroyo for the team lead.	Segura led off the fourth with a homer that barely eluded the top of Bruce's glove in right field and bounced off the top of the wall before continuing into the stands. Braun homered to right field on the next pitch, giving him eight overall and a season-high 11-game hitting streak.	Cingrani lasted only four innings, giving up five hits and two walks while throwing 85 pitches. It was the third time in the Reds' past four games that their starter lasted five innings or less.	The Reds activated catcher Ryan Hanigan off the disabled list before the series opener. Hanigan, the Reds' best defensive catcher, had been sidelined since April 21 by a strained left oblique. Hanigan had a pair of singles and made a diving catch behind the plate on Segura's sacrifice bunt attempt.	Game notes	 Steady rain fell through the early innings. .... The Reds designated C Corky Miller for assignment, opening a roster spot. ... OF Chris Heisey is expected to start a rehab assignment soon. He's been sidelined since April 29 by a pulled right hamstring. ... Cingrani picked Aoki off first base in the third inning. Aoki reached in all five plate appearances. ...

NEW YORK --  The umpires got this one right.	Garrett Jones hit a three-run homer -- a call that was correctly overturned by baseball's beleaguered umps -- and Wandy Rodriguez pitched the Pittsburgh Pirates to a 7-3 victory over the New York Mets on Friday night.	With runners at the corners in the fifth inning, Jones hit a drive to right off Shaun Marcum (0-3) that just cleared a leaping Marlon Byrd. The ball caromed back onto the field off the bottom of a black retaining wall just above the fence and initially was ruled in play.	Jones ended up on third and Pirates manager Clint Hurdle came out for a quick chat with crew chief Joe West, who cracked a smile as the discussion began. The umpires went inside to look at the replay and, after a 1 1/2-minute delay, came back on the field and signaled home run.	"It was barely over the top of the fence and careened back," West said. "So everything worked like it's supposed to."	It's been a rough week for umpires, who botched a home run review Wednesday in Cleveland and goofed on a pitching-change rule the next night in Houston. Major League Baseball executive vice president Joe Torre said Angel Hernandez's crew made an "improper call" in Cleveland, and MLB suspended umpire Fieldin Culbreth for two games Friday because he was in charge in Houston.	Culbreth and the rest of his crew -- Brian O'Nora, Bill Welke and Adrian Johnson -- were also fined an undisclosed amount.	Hurdle wouldn't reveal what it was that made West grin: "That's between me and the Cowboy," he said with a smile of his own.	West explained that he simply inquired if the manager was "asking nicely" for a review.	"And he says, 'Yes.' And I said, 'Sure.' "	"I had Clint when he first started as a player," West said. "It was very professional, the way it should be."	Jones doubled twice and leadoff man Starling Marte also had three hits for the Pirates, who improved to 4-13 at Citi Field. Pittsburgh had lost four of five overall, including the opener of this four-game series Thursday.	Handed an early lead, Rodriguez (3-2) allowed six hits over six innings to win for the first time in four starts. He gave up Anthony Recker's first homer for the Mets but worked around a leadoff double in the fourth and held New York to 0 for 9 with runners in scoring position.	"He was able to get through innings and leave runners on base," Hurdle said. "He gave us what we needed."	Mets captain David Wright went down after fouling a pitch off the inside of his left knee in the first inning, but stayed in the game until he was lifted in the ninth.	"It was pretty sore, but he said he thought he could play," manager Terry Collins said.	Rodriguez improved to 4-0 in his last five starts against New York and 6-2 overall. Vin Mazzaro tossed two scoreless innings and Jason Grilli retired Ruben Tejada with two on, making him perfect in 14 save chances this season.	"We needed to win the game," Hurdle said, explaining why he went to Grilli.	Pirates reliever Jose Contreras gave up a solo homer to Jordany Valdespin and an RBI single to Andrew Brown in the ninth.	Marcum looked uncomfortable on the mound and worked deliberately all night. He has failed to get through the fifth inning in any of his three starts for the Mets since beginning the season on the disabled list.	"I feel good. The thing is, I'm just not making pitches," Marcum said. "When you don't throw 95 (mph) and the ball's up in the zone, they're going to get hit. The main thing is I've got to get back to locating and getting the ball down in the zone."	The right-hander had three 1-2-3 innings but still gave up six runs and nine hits. He also hit two batters with pitches.	Jones opened a three-run second with a double to left-center, the first of four straight hits off Marcum. Pedro Alvarez had an RBI single and Rodriguez drove in a run with a bases-loaded smash up the middle that knocked Marcum's glove off his left hand.	The play turned into a 1-4-6 forceout after the ball deflected to second baseman Justin Turner. Marcum was checked twice by a trainer but remained in the game.	"I'm very, very worried about his hand. I thought for sure he broke his thumb the way the ball came off it," Collins said. "But the X-rays were negative, so we'll just get him on the side and, hopefully, he continues to get a little bit better."	Marcum said his hand was "still a little sore, but it should be good to go."	Pittsburgh made it 3-0 when Tejada struggled to get the ball out of his glove and double-clutched a throw on Marte's run-scoring single to shortstop. The Pirates, who batted around in the inning, could easily have scored more if Jose Tabata hadn't been cut down at third for the first out on Alvarez's single to right.	The homer by Jones extended Pittsburgh's lead to 6-0. Even he wasn't sure if his drive cleared the wall.	"It looked like it hit the top of the fence a little bit and kind of ricocheted off the fence. I couldn't really tell so I just kept running," Jones said. "It always feels good when they're able to come on the field and twirl a finger."	The clutch hitting was a welcome change for the Pirates, who went 0 for 7 with runners in scoring position Thursday night. They entered 4 for 45 (.089) in those situations over the previous six games.	Pittsburgh has homered in 11 of its last 12 games.	Game notes	 It was the fourth home run review of the season for the Pirates. ... Pittsburgh C Russell Martin sat out and said his neck stiffened up again after he returned action Thursday. He hopes to be back in the lineup Sunday. ... LHP Francisco Liriano is set to come off the disabled list and make his Pirates debut Saturday against Mets LHP Jonathon Niese (2-3, 4.66 ERA). Liriano has been sidelined all season while recovering from a broken right arm. Niese's back was feeling much better than a week ago, Collins said.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Alex Cobb wasn't sure if he should be elated or disappointed.	The Tampa Bay pitcher struck out 13 in fewer than five innings against the San Diego Padres on Friday night. The Rays won 6-3; however, Cobb didn't feel as though he'd truly done his job.	"I don't know if that's a good thing," Cobb said when told he'd become the first player in major league history to fan that many batters and fail to make it through the fifth. "As a starting pitcher, you want to go at least five innings every time out."	The right-hander left after throwing 117 pitches. He recorded 12-of-14 outs on strikeouts -- four of them in the third, when a wild pitch on strike three allowed Will Venable to reach base.	The other outs were recorded on grounders to shortstop in the first and third base in the fourth.	"I can't really explain why or how that happened. It was just one of those weird days," Cobb said. "Obviously, that's not my goal. I never go into a game trying to strike everybody out. I was trying to put balls over the plate and have them make weak contact, and they were swinging and missing."	The Padres struck out 18 times.	"He had his changeup going and it was tough to differentiate that from the fastball, and he had us on our heels the whole night," Venable said. "He pitched really well, and we just weren't able to make the adjustment."	Roberts and Zobrist both delivered two-run singles in the seventh, when reliever Dale Thayer (0-2) inherited a 3-2 lead from Padres starter Edinson Volquez. Jake McGee (1-2) pitched one inning for the victory, and Fernando Rodney worked a scoreless ninth for his fifth save.	Venable and Carlos Quentin hit solo homers off Cobb in the first for San Diego. Chris Denorfia also singled twice off the Tampa Bay starter, who allowed three runs, five hits, one walk and hit a batter.	Trailing 3-2, Cobb struck out Chase Headley and Quentin to begin the fifth. He was removed after walking Yonder Alonso, ending a streak of Tampa Bay starting pitchers working at least five innings in every game this season at 34 -- the second-longest stretch to begin a season behind the 1981 Pittsburgh Pirates (45).	Rays manager Joe Maddon had no regrets about not allowing Cobb to continue.	"I just could not permit it and feel good about myself at that point. His career is way too important to him and his family and to us," Maddon said.	"At the end of the day it's about the Rays. And for me, it's about the future of these players. ... To have him injure himself because he's going to throw 125 pitches in five innings, that would be on me. You have to be careful at that point."	Umpires Fieldin Culbreth, Brian O'Nora, Bill Welke and Adrian Johnson worked the game. Earlier in the day, Major League Baseball suspended Culbreth for two games because he was in charge of the crew when it allowed Astros manager Bo Porter to improperly switch relievers in the middle of an inning on Thursday.	Culbreth, O'Nora, Welke and Johnson were also fined an undisclosed amount after MLB admitted its umpires made a mistake for the second straight day.	Culbreth told a pool reporter after Friday's game that he takes "all the responsibility" for what happened.	As for the discipline?	"I look at it that baseball has high standards for their umpires and I have high standards for myself and I didn't meet those standards last night, so I am absolutely OK with everything," Culbreth said.	Cobb had nine strikeouts in the first three innings. He worked an extended third, when his wild pitch enabled Venable to reach base. The Padres center fielder stole second and third base, then scored on a balk to make it 3-0.	The Rays starter became the second Tampa Bay pitcher to fan four batters in an inning, joining Jeremy Hellickson, who did it against Detroit on Aug. 25, 2011.	Volquez allowed three runs and three hits in six innings. Evan Longoria had two of the hits off the right-hander, including a RBI single in the third. Tampa Bay a second run in the third on a wild pitch.	Game notes	 RHP Burch Smith will make his major league debut for the Padres on Saturday night. The 23-year-old was called up from Double-A San Antonio, where he was 1-2 with a 1.15 ERA in six starts. Manager Bud Black has seen Smith pitch only once, in the 2011 Arizona Instructional League, and Smith has not pitched at the Triple-A level. "I'm happy for him," Black said. "Our minor league people thought that he was the guy, so we'll see it (Saturday)." ... The Rays placed RHP Brandon Gomes on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to May 8, with a strained muscle in his right side. To fill his spot in the bullpen, RHP Josh Lueke was recalled from Triple-A Durham. ... Tampa Bay C Jose Molina is day to day with a bruised right knee. He was injured when he was hit by a foul tip during Thursday night's victory over Toronto.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

CHICAGO --  The Los Angeles Angels aren't nearly where they want to be. At least they're making progress.	Mike Trout had two hits, including the go-ahead single in the seventh inning, to lead the Angels to a 7-5 win over the Chicago White Sox on Friday night. Los Angeles' bullpen pitched 5 2/3 scoreless innings for the win, and helped the Angels to their first consecutive victories since beating the Tigers three straight April 19-21.	They also improved to 6-13 on the road. Their seven runs were the most since they scored eight in a 10-8 loss April 29 at Oakland.	"They're all important," said Brendan Harris, who had three hits and a home run. "So if we can get two in a row and just get a little momentum, and everybody can exhale a little bit, it's going lend itself better to really getting on a roll to really get going as we get into May."	The Angels got their second win in a row thanks to a big third inning when they scored four times, and a bullpen that helped Los Angeles survive after expected starter Tommy Hanson was put on the restricted list early Friday.	In his first start of the season, Barry Enright replaced Hanson, lasting 3 1/3 innings, giving up four hits and five runs. Relievers Mark Lowe, Michael Kohn (1-0), Dane De La Rosa and Ernesto Frieri then combined to blank the White Sox, who have lost four of six.	Lowe relieved Enright and worked 1 2/3 scoreless innings, Kohn went an inning, De La Rosa two, then Frieri finished by striking out the side in the ninth for his sixth save in seven tries.	"I think the length that we needed, plus the effectiveness, those guys stepped up big," manager Mike Scioscia said.	Los Angeles, which won Thursday in Houston despite an umpiring error that led to a two-game suspension for crew chief Fieldin Culbreth, fell behind early.	Alejandro De Aza gave the White Sox a 1-0 lead in the first with a leadoff home run. The home run was De Aza's seventh of the season and seventh career leadoff homer. He's done it three times this season, including on Wednesday at New York. De Aza is the first Chicago player to start consecutive games with a home run since Kenny Lofton in July 2002.	The Angels scored four times in the third to take a 4-1 lead. Albert Pujols had a two-run double and Mark Trumbo an RBI single.	Los Angeles built a 5-1 lead after Harris homered in the fourth, but the White Sox rallied for four runs in the bottom half of the inning to tie it.	After that, the Los Angeles bullpen stifled the White Sox. Because of Hanson's status and injuries to the Angels bullpen, De La Rosa figured Friday might be a long night.	"When I do get the ball, I'm willing to throw however many innings they actually need me," he said.	In the seventh, Hank Conger reached on Conor Gillaspie's error to start the inning and scored on Trout's sharp single to right off reliever Matt Lindstrom that gave the Angels a 6-5 lead. J.B. Shuck then scored on a passed ball.	"We battled back, and you give them multiple opportunities and you're going to pay for it," White Sox manager Robin Ventura said. "That's just the name of it right there. You just can't give these guys a lot of opportunities."	In six-plus innings, Chicago starter Dylan Axelrod allowed six runs and seven hits. Axelrod (0-3) left after Gillaspie's error in the seventh.	"The whole game, I felt really good. It's just an unfortunate thing that they got some runs in the third. That's the frustrating part, where you feel great out there and still give up some runs," Axelrod said. "I can't be that disappointed in my effort because I felt I executed pretty well and they just happened to score."	Scioscia, meanwhile, saw his offense score seven runs and his bullpen finish off a needed win, both of which are some of "the components that you need to start to build momentum."	"It feels good to get this one and move on to tomorrow," he said.	Game notes	 Scioscia was asked Friday if owner Arte Moreno needed to give him a public vote of confidence and said, "Not for what I do. Not for my benefit." Los Angeles entered Friday having lost five of its past seven, fueling speculation about the job security of the Angels manager, who's in his 14th season. ... White Sox second baseman Gordon Beckham took 100 swings off a tee before Friday's game. Beckham is on the disabled list after breaking his left hamate bone April 9 in Washington and having surgery on April 16. ... Angels infielder Erick Aybar was not in the lineup after experiencing tightness in his right hamstring Thursday in Houston. Scioscia said Aybar and reliever Scott Downs, who injured his right foot Thursday, are both day-to-day.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  There's no Derek Jeter to lean on right now, no Alex Rodriguez or Mark Teixeira in the New York Yankees' high-priced lineup to provide clutch hits and big home runs.	Nope, there are just guys such as Lyle Overbay filling in with aplomb.	The low-key, aw-shucks Overbay hit a two-run homer and finished with five RBIs on Friday night, and Ichiro Suzuki also hit a two-run homer as the banged-up Yankees opened their only trip to Kansas City with an 11-6 rout of the scuffling Royals.	"Sometimes baseball doesn't make sense, and on a night we really needed some runs, we got them," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "Everyone seemed to help out tonight."	Overbay finished with a career-high four hits, Suzuki had three hits and Chris Nelson drove in a pair of runs for the Yankees, who gave Girardi his 500th win in pinstripes.	Girardi reached the milestone in his 844th game, one fewer than Billy Martin. The only Yankees managers to reach the mark faster were Casey Stengel, Joe McCarthy, Joe Torre and Miller Huggins.	"I've been blessed to have this opportunity," Girardi said. "As a child you dream about playing in the big leagues, and I don't know if you dream about managing, but as I got older, it's something I really wanted to do, and I got a great opportunity."	Phil Hughes (2-2) allowed six runs in 5 2/3 innings but still earned the victory for New York thanks to an offense that awoke from a slumber against Wade Davis and reliever Bruce Chen.	The struggling Davis (2-3) allowed seven runs in five-plus innings as the Royals lost for the fourth time in their past five games.	"I made it look a lot harder than it should," Davis said. "When you don't command your pitches, you can make anybody look a lot better. I didn't execute my pitches."	Jarrod Dyson hit a three-run shot for the Royals, just the second homer of his career, and Mike Moustakas went deep in his second straight game. Alex Gordon also drove in a pair of runs.	But it wasn't enough offense to keep up with the Yankees, who scored six runs total during a three-game series in Colorado, but surpassed that amount with the first of five runs during the sixth inning Friday night that broke open what had been a tie game.	It was the first time New York scored 10 or more runs since April 9, and allowed the Yankees to improve to 20-9 since their ragged 1-4 start to the season.	"The guys stepped up big and gave me a bunch of runs," Hughes said. "Thankfully, I was able to bring my not-so-good game on a day we scored a lot of runs."	The Yankees came into the night with 42 homers, fifth in the majors, and wasted little time adding to the total. Suzuki followed a walk by Travis Hafner with his two-run shot in the second inning, and Overbay followed a double by Jayson Nix with his two-run homer.	The Royals got most of their deficit back on Dyson's three-run shot in the bottom of the second. It was his first home run since Sept. 27, 2010, a span of 376 at-bats.	"He came in most of the time. I got my foot down on it and I was just trying to square him up," Dyson said. "I barreled it up. It was a big hit at the time."	Davis ran into more trouble in the fourth when Nix walked and Overbay drove him in with a double to make it 5-3. But the Royals answered again in the fifth, tying the game on a two-run double by Gordon, who has become the Royals' most reliable hitter.	The Yankees finally took control in the sixth inning.	Suzuki doubled and Nix singled to set up Overbay, who delivered his second double of the night. Nelson added a two-run single, and after Chris Stewart grounded into a fielder's choice, Brett Gardner's RBI triple and Robinson Cano's run-scoring single gave New York a 10-5 lead.	Moustakas added his solo homer in the sixth, but Yankees reliever Shawn Kelley retired the next seven Royals -- six of them by strikeout. Boone Logan finished up a quiet ninth to preserve the Yankees' third straight win.	"The bullpens are so important, especially in the American League," Girardi said. "Our guys have done a really good job. Shawn Kelley stepped up tonight. We've had other guys. ... It's been guy after guy doing the job."	Game notes	 Royals DH Billy Butler went 0-for-4, dropping his average to .236. ... Nix reached base four times. ... Royals RF Lorenzo Cain got hit on his left wrist by a pitch in the third inning. He remained in the game. ... INF Eduardo Nunez (ribs) hit in the cage before the game and was available off the bench, Girardi said. He did not play. ... New York LHP Andy Pettitte will start Saturday night against Royals RHP James Shields.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Thanks to the focus of guys such as Jim Johnson and the toughness of Manny Machado, the Baltimore Orioles don't play like the youngest team in their division.	Machado had a tiebreaking RBI single in a three-run 10th inning as the Orioles rallied for a 9-6 win over the Minnesota Twins on Friday night.	Machado -- who stayed in the game after fouling a ball hard off his ankle in the fifth -- rolled a single into right field that scored Chris Dickerson and broke a 6-all tie. Nick Markakis added a sacrifice fly and Adam Jones an RBI double to cap the scoring in the 10th.	"I told you many times, that's a mature group," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. "Even though it's the youngest team in our division, they stay within each other and do what they do."	Tommy Hunter (3-1) didn't allow a run in 2 1/3 innings. Jim Johnson pitched a scoreless bottom of the 10th for his 35th consecutive save -- dating back to last season -- to set an Orioles franchise record.	Johnson started getting questions about the save streak at the end of last season. He treated questions about finally setting the record with a shrug, the same way he answered when the streak began.	"I was just thinking about watching us chip away," Johnson said. "It's not really anything I'm real focused on. It's great, but our ultimate goal is the team record at the end of the year. Personal achievements are second."	Anthony Swarzak (1-1) allowed all three runs in the 10th.	Twins starter Mike Pelfrey had a 6-0 lead in the sixth inning and appeared to be cruising to his second straight win before Baltimore started smacking doubles all over the field.	"You've got to remember the offense over there, too," Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said. "That's a heck of a baseball team over there, and they can run some hitters up there. They can ambush you. They got some big, clutch hits. That's kind of what they're known for."	The Orioles hit four doubles off Pelfrey in the sixth to make it 6-3 and added two more off reliever Josh Roenicke in the seventh to tie the score.	"They're good. There's a reason they're in first place in the AL East," Pelfrey said.	Chris Davis's two-bagger off the scoreboard wall in right-center field scored Nick Markakis and made it 6-6.	Roenicke started the seventh and allowed three runs and four hits and only recorded one out.	"It's almost like we prefer to play from behind," Baltimore outfielder Chris Dickerson said. "As soon as it got to 6-3, we knew it was a different ballgame."	Markakis -- a career .535 hitter against the Twins -- started the barrage of doubles with a leadoff double in the sixth and finished with two hits and two RBIs.	Joe Mauer had three hits and two RBIs for Minnesota, which had won four of its previous five.	Adam Jones and Davis each had three hits for Baltimore.	Orioles starter Jason Hammel allowed six runs over four innings and failed to win on the road for the first time this season.	Game notes	 SS Pedro Florimon, who left Thursday's game in the bottom of the seventh inning because of a tight right hamstring, was not in the starting lineup but told Gardenhire his leg was feeling better. ... Orioles LHP Tsuyoshi Wada, who had Tommy John ligament replacement surgery on his elbow last May 11 and spent his entire first season in the majors on the DL, struck out 10 batters in seven no-hit innings in an extended spring training game in Sarasota, Fla. Showalter said Wada would start a rehab assignment next week. ... RHP Steve Johnson will come off the DL to start Saturday in his season debut for the Orioles in place of RHP Miguel Gonzalez, who is out with a blister on his thumb. For the Twins, RH Vance Worley (0-4, 6.95 ERA) will take the mound looking for his first win in 13 starts since last Aug. 1 for the Phillies.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

HOUSTON --  The Texas Rangers put on quite the power display Friday night against the Houston Astros.	Nelson Cruz hit a monstrous home run to tie the score in the sixth inning, Jeff Baker's shot put the Rangers ahead in the next inning and David Murphy added one in the ninth as Texas beat Houston 4-2.	Three relievers threw 3 1/3 perfect innings to help the Rangers get the win.	Baker greeted Wesley Wright (0-1) with a leadoff home run to right field in the seventh to give the Rangers, who entered the game last in the American League with 14 home runs on the road, their first lead of the night at 3-2.	"Any time you can contribute, it is awesome," Baker said. "Especially when you are in the utility role, and you are trying to make the most of your opportunities, getting a big hit. Getting the series started with a win is obviously huge for us."	Murphy's shot leading off the ninth inning against Travis Blackley extended the Rangers' lead and traveled 411 feet.	Cruz tied the score at 2-2 with a big solo home run to left field in the sixth off Houston starter Dallas Keuchel. The 416-foot shot bounced off the glass facade above the railroad tracks for Cruz's eighth homer of the season.	It ended a 0 for 12 skid for Cruz, who has tied games with four of his long balls this year.	"That one Cruz got was huge to get us back in the ballgame right there after they stole a run from us," Washington said. "And then Baker gets us the lead run and Murphy a little bit of insurance. It was all needed."	Robbie Ross (1-0) pitched 1 1/3 perfect innings before Tanner Scheppers pitched the eighth and Joe Nathan the ninth for his 10th save of the season.	"The bullpen was outstanding," Washington said. "For Robbie to come in and get us 1 1/3 innings and then Schep came in and had a good breaking ball tonight to go with that live fastball that he has. And then Joe did the rest. It was solid."	Nathan said the bullpen is in a pretty good rhythm.	"The young guys who were question marks coming into the year are throwing the ball great," Nathan said. "Obviously, we are passing the ball along pretty good. We are in a rhythm. We have good confidence down there. We are just trying to throw as many quality pitches as we can and get outs. We know coming out of the `pen, we got to be aggressive, throw strikes and get outs for us. Fortunately, it has gone well."	Trevor Crowe put the Astros in front 1-0 in the second with a solo home run to left field off Alexi Ogando.	The home run was Crowe's first in 234 at-bats since July 23, 2010, when he was with the Indians.	Elvis Andrus tied it at 1-1 in the third with a bases-loaded walk. The Rangers loaded the bases with one out on a walk by Geovany Soto and singles by Craig Gentry and Ian Kinsler. Following Andrus' walk, Keuchel struck out Lance Berkman and got Adrian Beltre to fly out to center to end the inning.	Houston responded with a run of its own in the bottom of the inning as Jose Altuve doubled with one out, advanced to third on Jason Castro's groundout and scored on Ogando's wild pitch to make it 2-1.	"That was a great reaction," Houston manager Bo Porter said. "He broke the minute the ball broke down. That was great anticipation by Altuve, and a good heads up play."	Ogando was rocky in the first, loading the bases on a walk to Chris Carter with two outs before inducing a flyout to center by Carlos Pena to end the inning.	Keuchel, making his first start of the season after appearing in six games this season out of the bullpen, allowed two runs on five hits with two walks and three strikeouts in six innings.	Keuchel said he felt good on the mound and felt he could have gone longer.	"Before the game I told some of the guys that, since I went to the bullpen and then had that one start down in Triple A, my body has been responding well," Keuchel said. "Even though I got a little hot early, I was able to settle in a little bit."	Ogando went 5 2/3 innings, allowing two runs and five hits with three strikeouts and a season-high four walks.	Game notes	 Texas C A.J. Pierzynski was placed on the disabled list Friday, retroactive to May 6 with a right oblique strain. C Robinson Chirinos was recalled from Triple A Round Rock Friday to take Pierzynski's place on the roster. ... Houston RHP Josh Fields, who has been on the disabled list since April 4 with a strained right forearm, began a rehab assignment Friday with Class A Quad Cities. ... Rangers RHP Yu Darvish, who is 5-1 with a 2.56 ERA, will take the mound Saturday for the first time against Houston since he threw 8 2/3 perfect innings against the Astros on April 2. Houston will counter with LHP Erik Bedard, who is 0-2 with a 7.36 ERA.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ST. LOUIS -- Shelby Miller gave up a single to start the game then nothing else. Not a walk or a hit batter. No one even reached on an error.	Nothing.	The St. Louis Cardinals rookie was perfect after that leadoff single by Eric Young Jr., retiring 27 in a row for his first career complete game, 3-0 over the Colorado Rockies on Friday night.	"I feel really good," Miller said. "It's definitely the best game I've thrown in my life. How it finished was unbelievable. It was a great experience. Yadi (catcher Yadier Molina) was calling a great game and they were making great plays for me. It was a start I'll remember the rest of my life."	Miller (5-2) struck out Young to end it with his 13th K, tying a Cardinals rookie record.	Young felt fortunate just to reach base at all.	"It was a jam shot and I just put it in a good location," Young said. "I was just fortunate enough to find grass.	"He was working both sides of the plate, using his fastball. He had great command," Young added. "His battery mate back there is obviously one of the best game. It was a good combo for them."	Miller agreed with Young's assessment of Molina.	"I say it time and time again, what Yadi calls, I throw," Miller said. "He was calling the right thing all night. He's done a terrific job all year and he's helping me out tremendously. I'm happy he's my catcher, that's for sure."	The one-hitter was the fewest hits allowed by a Cardinals pitcher since Bud Smith tossed a no-hitter on Sept. 3, 2001, and it was the second one-hitter of the night in the major leagues. Boston's Jon Lester was perfect until he allowed a two-out double in the sixth against Toronto.	In a near-perfect performance, Miller threw 113 pitches.	"It's pretty incredible," St. Louis manager Mike Matheny said. "How he held his composure, made real good pitches all night long against a very good offense."	Miller lowered his ERA to 1.39, which is the lowest for a Cardinals pitcher in his first eight starts since Howie Pollet had a 2.09 ERA in his first eight in 1941.	Carlos Beltran hit a solo homer -- his ninth -- for St. Louis. Pete Kozma added an RBI single and Jon Jay a sacrifice fly for the Cardinals, who are National League-best 22-12.	Molina had two hits to extend his hitting streak to 10 games, which is the longest for a Cardinal this season.	Rockies starter Jon Garland (2-3) gave up all three runs in five innings. Garland allowed seven hits and three walks while striking out five.	Garland retired the first five batters he faced before Jay singled to center with two outs in the second. David Freese walked, and Kozma drove home Jay with a single to left.	Beltran made it 2-0 when he hit Garland's first pitch of the third inning 409 feet into the seats in right. Jay gave the Cardinals a three-run cushion with a sacrifice fly in the fifth.	Game notes	Dick Hughes and Scipio Spinks also struck out 13 for the Cardinals as rookies. ... Molina is batting .461 (18 for 39) during his hitting streak. ... Colorado has not won a series in St. Louis since sweeping four games from June 5-8, 2009. ... Jay extended his hitting streak to seven games with his second-inning single. ... Garland is 1-6 with 6.61 ERA in his career against St. Louis. ... Former Cy Young award winner Chris Carpenter took another step toward possibly returning to the mound by tossing a pain-free bullpen session. The 38-year-old's career appeared as if it may be over when it was announced in February that he was unlikely to pitch in 2013 because he was still experiencing chronic pain in his neck, shoulder and arm. Friday's bullpen session was the fourth for Carpenter, who tossed about 70 pitches.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PHOENIX --  Arizona Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson moved Miguel Montero down to eighth in the lineup, hoping it would give him a spark, playing a hunch that he might come up in a big situation.	He was right on both counts.	Hitting before the pitcher for the first time in two years, Montero hit a tiebreaking homer off the right foul pole in the eighth inning, helping the Diamondbacks beat the Philadelphia Phillies 3-2 Friday night for their fifth straight victory.	"One of the things when you're hitting eighth is that you have to tell yourself you might come up in a situation where you can do something good, which he did," Gibson said. "It was huge for us."	The Diamondbacks struggled most of the night against Phillies starter Tyler Cloyd, managing two hits off him in 6 2/3 innings. They came through when he went out, though, scoring on a run in the seventh when Martin Prado broke a 29 at-bat hitless streak with runners in scoring position, then taking the lead when Montero hit the first pitch thrown by Mike Adams (1-3) in the eighth that curled toward the foul pole in right and just caught it.	Tony Sipp (2-1) got two outs in the eighth inning and David Hernandez worked out of a jam in the ninth for his first save, sending Arizona to its sixth win in seven games.	"I knew the ball was gone, but you have so much bad luck that I was running around and was like, wow, I can't believe that ball is going to go foul," Montero said. "I was fortunate enough to hit the pole. It feels great to help the team because I've been disappointed in myself not being able to the ball the way I wanted."	The Phillies jumped on Kennedy early, starting with Rollins' 44th career leadoff homer that tied him with Brady Anderson for fourth all-time. They scored another run in the first inning, but struggled the rest of the way against Kennedy and couldn't score against Hernandez with runners on second and third with one out in the ninth.	Laynce Nix made the second out in the ninth with a soft infield pop-up and Hernandez ended the game by getting Rollins to ground out to first.	"We broke through, but we made some mistakes," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said. "At the same time, we got four hits in that (first) inning, but we didn't capitalize on [a] better opportunity, then we didn't add on during the game."	Kennedy has labored since beating St. Louis on Opening Day, allowing four or more runs three times during a six-game winless streak. The right-hander lost to San Diego after allowing four runs in seven innings in his last outing and got off to a rough start against the Phillies.	Rollins hit the first pitch of the game out to right for his 44th career leadoff homer, matching Brady Anderson for fourth all time. Domonic Brown followed a walk and another hit with a run-scoring single that put the Phillies up 2-0.	Kennedy found a rhythm after that, allowing a single in the second inning and no other hits until Ben Revere led off the seventh with a single. He was lifted for a pinch hitter in the bottom half after allowing two runs on six hits with four strikeouts.	"It was his best outing of the season, especially those last two innings," Gibson said.	Cloyd was just as good.	The right-hander pitched six games for the Phillies in 2012, going 2-2, and opened this season in the minors.	He was called up to start against the Diamondbacks after Roy Halladay went out with a shoulder injury.	Making his season debut in one of baseball's most hitter-friendly parks didn't seem to bother the 25-year-old.	In the first inning, Eric Chavez lined a double to the right field corner off him and Paul Goldschmidt just beat John Mayberry's throw after running through -- almost literally -- third-base coach Matt Williams' stop sign.	Cloyd had the Diamondbacks guessing after that, working around a pair of walks in the fourth inning with a double play and allowing no hits until Cody Ross hit a one-out flare single to left in the seventh.	He was lifted after that, but didn't figure into the decision because Ross tagged up on Jason Kubel's long fly ball to get into scoring position and scored on Prado's run-scoring single off Antonio Bastardo.	Cloyd allowed two hits and struck out four, but is headed back to Triple-A Lehigh Valley. Right-hander Justin De Fratus will be called up to take his spot on the roster.	"They told me no matter what happened tonight, they were going to end up sending me down," Cloyd said. "I have to go down there and keep going, keep myself in a position to come back up and help them out again."	Game notes	 Rollins' leadoff homer gave the Phillies 14 straight solo shots. ... Phillies RHP Roy Halladay, who's out with a shoulder injury, thanked Philadelphia's fans for their support before Friday's game and apologized to the ones who were angry that he pitched while hurt. "I just want the fans to know I'm thinking about them," he said. "I don't take that for granted. I don't take playing for Philadelphia for granted." ... Arizona right-hander Trevor Cahill, who will start against the Phillies on Saturday, has allowed four runs in 20 innings (1.80) his past three starts. ... Left-hander Cliff Lee will start for the Phillies after allowing two runs in eight innings against the Giants his last start.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

SEATTLE --  With the blister on a finger of his pitching hand fully healed, Hisashi Iwakuma felt he could throw basically any pitch he wanted in an impressive seven innings.	It looked much the same as his previous starts.	Iwakuma retired 16 straight over one stretch, Raul Ibanez homered for the first time in nearly a month and the Seattle Mariners beat the Oakland Athletics 6-3 on Friday night.	"He repeats. He's so consistent with his delivery, his arm action, his arm slot, release point, it's tough to see what is coming out," Seattle manager Eric Wedge said. "That's what you have to do. If you're going to be a solid starting pitcher up here, you've got to do that."	Iwakuma (4-1) took a one-hitter into the sixth inning before running into trouble, putting together another strong outing to help cement himself and Felix Hernandez as one of the top rotation duos in baseball. Iwakuma has allowed five earned runs over his past five starts, and the number could have been even smaller if not for a scoring change that ended up tagging him with two earned runs against the A's.	Overshadowed by Hernandez, the ace of the Mariners staff, Iwakuma has been nearly as solid this season. He's pitched at least six innings in seven of eight starts despite being bothered by a lingering blister on his pitching hand, and has not allowed more than three earned runs in any start.	"Those two have just been on another level," Seattle third baseman Kyle Seager said. "Everybody knows Felix, obviously, but (Iwakuma) he's been flying under the radar a little bit but he's been just as impressive. It's been pretty fun to play behind those two especially."	Iwakuma gave up a solid leadoff single to right field to John Jaso and then was unhittable for the next five innings. He set down 15 straight with remarkable ease, through a combination of broken bats, weak ground balls and lazy flies. He struck out Yoenis Cespedes to close the first, struck out Derek Norris and Jaso in the third and retired Josh Donaldson and Daric Barton swinging to end the fifth.	Iwakuma's streak finally ended at 16 straight retired when Eric Sogard reached on an infield single -- originally ruled an error -- with one-out in the sixth inning. His ground ball bounced off the arm of shortstop Brendan Ryan and Sogard reached without a throw. Jaso followed with a bloop single, and the A's finally got to Iwakuma on Jed Lowrie's two-out, two-run double into the right-field corner. Lowrie had just one RBI in his previous 17 games before the double.	The scoring change cost Iwakuma a chance to have his ERA dip below Hernandez's for the best in the American League. Instead, Iwakuma's ERA rose from 1.61 to 1.74. He gave up four hits, struck out nine and walked none.  Tom Wilhelmsen pitched the ninth for his 10th save.	"It's a mental relief, being able to pitch with that much of a big lead is big for myself, so being able to pitch with a better rhythm helped me be able to go through seven innings," Iwakuma said through an interpreter.	Seattle scored twice in the first off Oakland starter Dan Straily (1-1). Seattle broke the game open with Ibanez's three-run homer in the third inning that came with two outs.  Oakland lost its season-high fifth straight and dipped below .500 since starting the season 1-2. The A's fell to 2-6 on their current 10-game road trip and only once has Oakland scored more than three runs.	"Everybody has to pick everybody up and we're not doing that right now," Oakland manager Bob Melvin said.	Straily struggled to get through five innings, but didn't get help from his defense starting in the first inning that led to two runs. Kendrys Morales' chopper to left side bounced past both third baseman Josh Donaldson and Lowrie at shortstop to put runners at the corners with one out instead of a possible inning-ending double play. Michael Morse followed with an RBI single and Justin Smoak lined an RBI double to give Iwakuma an early lead.	Seattle's runs in the third also came thanks to a fortunate bounce. Seager reached on an infield single that spun awkwardly off the end of his bat. Straily gave up a two-out walk to Smoak that proved costly when Ibanez turned on a 1-1 pitch for his third homer of the season and first since April 14.	"It's always nice to contribute and the last few games I've played I guess have been better," Ibanez said.	Game notes	 Seattle improved to 16-8 this season when its starting pitcher works at least six innings. They are 1-11 when the starter fails to get through six. ... Seager scored three of the four times he reached base. ... Oakland's Derek Norris hit a solo homer, his first of the season, in the eighth off Seattle reliever Oliver Perez.

LOS ANGELES --  Derek Dietrich will always remember his first major league home run, and the fact that it was a timely hit for the Marlins was a bonus.	Dietrich tied the game with a three-run shot, Juan Pierre singled in the go-ahead run in the seventh inning and Miami dealt the Los Angeles Dodgers their eighth straight loss, 5-4 on Friday night.	The Marlins tied the game 3-all in the fourth on Dietrich's three-run homer with two outs. Placido Polanco and Marcell Ozuna sandwiched walks around a strikeout by Justin Ruggiano and a pop foul by Greg Dobbs before Dietrich sent a 3-2 pitch into the right field pavilion while playing in his second major league game.	"How special," Dietrich said. "So many greats have played here. It kind of brings chills. I'm glad my family got to see it."	Miami ended its own three-game losing streak in the matchup of cellar dwellers. The Marlins have the NL's worst record at 11-25, and got outscored 11-1 during a three-game sweep in San Diego.	"We've been waiting on a big hit," Marlins manager Mike Redmond said. "Got a young kid up there who's taking advantage of an opportunity."	Rookie Jose Fernandez (2-2) allowed three runs and eight hits in six innings, struck out seven and walked two for his second major league win, having won at Philadelphia last weekend.	"I keep learning every start," he said.	Fernandez threw 17 consecutive strikes at one point in the game.	"He's one of those guys that you want to get to early because, as he gets settled, he's going to get better as the game goes on," Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said. "He was aggressive in the strike zone and he wasn't afraid of anybody. He was coming right after us."	Steve Cishek pitched the ninth to earn his fifth save in six chances.	Former Dodger Pierre singled to left field in the seventh, giving Miami a 4-3 lead. Adeiny Hechavarria grounded into a double play, scoring pinch-hitter Chris Coghlan, who doubled off the top of the wall in center field. The umpires reviewed the play and upheld second base ump Chris Guccione's original call after Marlins manager Mike Redmond came out to discuss it.	"It was a big play at the time and I just wanted to make sure they got it right, and they did," Redmond said.	The Dodgers blew an early lead for the second straight game in equaling their longest skid since dropping eight in a row from Aug. 22-29, 2008. Five of the losses have been at home, tying their longest such skid since May 28-June 11 last year.	At 13-21, the Dodgers are last in the NL West and have yet to win in May. Mattingly is facing rampant speculation about his future with his high-priced lineup failing to contend.	Ronald Belisario (2-4) took the loss, giving up two runs and three hits in one-plus innings. He walked one and struck out none.	The Dodgers have scored three runs or less seven times during their skid. Sluggers Matt Kemp and Andre Ethier continued to slump, combining to go 1 for 8. Kemp struck out twice.	Rookie Matt Magill made his third career start for the Dodgers, giving up three runs and five hits in five innings. He struck out two and walked four in his second straight poor outing. The right-hander didn't make it out of the second inning last weekend at San Francisco.	Los Angeles closed to 5-4 in the eighth when A.J. Ellis singled in Kemp, who led off with a single and stole second. They had the tying run on third when Dee Gordon grounded out to second base to end the inning.	The Dodgers loaded the bases with two outs in the sixth, but pinch-hitter Tim Federowicz flied out to center to end the inning.	After trailing early, Redmond noticed a change in Fernandez.	"He came out up in the zone in the first and then he turned it up after that and was lights out," the manager said. "He pounded the strike zone and kept guys off-balance."	The Dodgers staked Magill to a 3-0 lead in the first on Adrian Gonzalez's three-run homer. Carl Crawford led off with a single and Nick Punto walked to set up Gonzalez. They led 2-0 on Wednesday and ended up losing 3-2 to Arizona.	Fernandez said that his first pitch after the homer "I felt like now I'm pitching. I'm young and trying to get adjusted to the game."	Game notes	 Dodgers RHP Zack Greinke and LHP Scott Elbert made their first rehab appearances for Single-A Rancho Cucamonga in its game at Lake Elsinore on Friday night. Greinke allowed eight runs -- three earned -- and six hits in 4 1/3 innings, struck out four and walked none. He broke his left collarbone in a bench-clearing brawl at San Diego last month. Elbert was expected to throw one inning of relief while rehabbing from left elbow surgery. ... Marlins INF Chris Valaika had two pins inserted in his left wrist Friday in Miami. He's expected to be out six to eight weeks. ... The Marlins shuffled their rotation for Sunday's series finale. RHP Tom Koehler will start in place of LHP Wade LeBlanc. ... The Dodgers selected the contract of OF/1B Scott Van Slyke from Triple-A Albuquerque and optioned IF/OF Elian Herrera back to Albuquerque three days after he had been called up. They also transferred RHP Chad Billingsley to the 60-day DL. He had Tommy John surgery on April 24.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Facing Tim Hudson usually means bad news for the San Francisco Giants.	They turned the tables Friday night in an 8-2 victory over the Atlanta Braves, beating the veteran right-hander for the first time in seven years.	The Giants drove Hudson from the game in a six-run fourth inning that represented their biggest rally of the season.	That support proved plenty for Matt Cain (2-2), who went eight innings and turned in his second straight stellar outing after going winless over his first six starts.	The Giants' ace allowed just three hits and chipped in with an RBI single during the six-run rally. His effort was badly needed for a rotation that came in having posted just 16 quality starts in 35 games.	"When you get some run support like I did tonight, against a guy that's done what he's done in his career, that's always nice," Cain said. "It's always a battle with him."	The Giants hadn't beaten Hudson since April 8, 2006, a span during which he was 6-0 with a 2.48 ERA against San Francisco.	Hudson (4-2) was cruising until the fourth, when the Giants batted around and scored six runs. That rally featured two hits by Marco Scutaro, including a two-run single.	Buster Posey split the left-center gap with an RBI double to kick-start things. Hunter Pence dribbled an infield single to score another and Brandon Belt chopped a run-scoring double over Atlanta first baseman Freddie Freeman.	Brandon Crawford was intentionally walked with one out to load the bases for Cain, who stepped to the plate 0-for-11 on the season. He grounded a single through the right side to make it 4-0, and Scutaro capped the rally with a two-run single to left to drive Hudson from the game.	The six runs and seven hits were the most the Giants have managed in any single inning this season. Hudson tied his season high with six runs allowed in 3 2/3 innings, his shortest outing of the season.	"Obviously, it was a nightmare inning," Hudson said. "I made very good pitches to get the inning going and then it seemed when I needed a break here or there, their balls just found some holes. I had a hard time stopping the bleeding."	The Braves did their only damage off Cain when Brian McCann crushed a two-run homer to right in the fifth. It marked the 26th time an opponent knocked one into McCovey Cove on the fly, and it was the 88th "splash hit" overall since AT&T Park opened in 2000.	Cain delivered his best start of the season despite taking a liner off his hip from the bat of McCann in the second. He recovered and chased the ball down by the first-base line and got the out.	"What a great job, a clutch job," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "We needed a lot of length from our starter tonight and he did more than that. Eight solid innings -- especially after getting hit."	McCann was the bright spot for Atlanta. After missing the first 31 games of the season while recovering from shoulder surgery, he's 5-for-16 with two homers and seven RBI in four games.	"I've felt good since spring training and I carried it into the season and on my rehab stints," McCann said.	Game notes	 Scutaro has a 10-game hitting streak during which he's hitting .487 (19-for-39). However, his sore back acted up during the game and Bochy wasn't sure if the second baseman would play Saturday. ... Struggling Giants right-hander Ryan Vogelsong will make his next start as scheduled Wednesday at Toronto, Bochy said. There was speculation that Vogelsong, 1/3 with a 7.78 ERA, might be skipped for a turn.  ... Madison Bumgarner, who takes the ball Saturday against Atlanta, has received just four runs of support over his past four starts. ... Carlos Tosca served as the Braves' interim manager Friday in place of Fredi Gonzalez and will do so again Saturday, with Gonzalez in Georgia to attend his daughter's college graduation. ... Right fielder Jason Heyward did not play Friday for Triple-A Gwinnett, one day after beginning a rehab assignment following his emergency appendectomy April 22. GM Frank Wren said Heyward was experiencing "normal soreness" after the long layoff. ... Left-hander Paul Maholm, who starts Saturday, is 2-2 with a 3.43 ERA in nine career starts against the Giants.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

NEW YORK --  Francisco Liriano finally got to pitch for Pittsburgh and, just like that, the Pirates looked like a much better team.	He struck out nine and the Pirates teed off on New York's pitching for an 11-2 win over the Mets on Saturday.	"He's pitched before and he's been good," Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said. "Good to have him in the fold now, for me it's -- three left-handers in the rotation, I like that a lot. Especially in the division we're in, the way we match up against the team.	Jordy Mercer homered twice and Jose Tabata had four hits, including a two-run shot for the Pirates.	The Mets have struggled to score at home, but the start by Jonathon Niese (2-4) would have put any team in a hole. He tied a career high by allowing eight runs, and walked more batters than he struck out for the fourth time in eight starts this season.	Liriano (1-0), returning from a broken non-throwing arm, allowed one run in 5 1/3 innings and 90 pitches. He gave up six hits and two walks.	"Today went good. Really good location and just using a lot today," Liriano said. "It was a little weird, nervous. But that went away and it just feels good to get the first one out of the way."	After a late-spring injury to Jeff Karstens and the release of Jonathan Sanchez, the Pirates needed the help in their rotation. Now they can line up Liriano after fellow lefties Jeff Locke and Wandy Rodriguez.	"Three left-handers in the rotation, I like that a lot," Hurdle said. "You can probably count the teams on one hand that have really good offensive splits more so against left-handed pitchers than against right-handed pitching."	The Pirates jumped on Niese early, and finally drove him out of the game in the fifth.	Mercer hit a solo shot after third baseman David Wright made a nifty barehanded play to throw out Starling Marte, and Tabata hit an RBI double off the base of the wall in center field.	Michael McKenry followed with a two-run single off reliever Scott Atchison and Clint Barmes followed with an RBI single before Liriano popped foul to end the inning.	Liriano agreed to a contract with Pittsburgh in the offseason, but broke his right arm on Dec. 25, the day before he was supposed to fly to Pittsburgh and sign a $12.75 million, two-year contract. Liriano, who said he was injured when he slapped a door in his house, signed a revised offer and prepared for a delayed start to the season.	And Liriano delivered. He set the first seven batters down in order, and the Mets didn't get anyone to third base until the sixth inning, when Justin Turner singled with Wright on first and one out. Marlon Byrd hit a tough dribbler down the third base line that Brandon Inge charged, but he mishandled the transfer to his throwing hand on a play that was ruled a single.	The Mets put two runners on in the fourth inning after Byrd's two-out single. But Liriano struck out Andrew Brown. He fanned Daniel Murphy to end the fifth after Tejada's double.	Barmes hit an RBI single in the second inning and Tabata hit a two-run homer in the third, after McCutchen's RBI single.	The game was delayed 47 minutes by rain in the middle of the ninth. When play resumed, Brown led off with a solo home run off left-hander Tony Watson. The ball went deep to left, where both of Mercer's home runs landed.	"For our guys to swing the bats today the way they did in a big ballpark, I think that was a feel good for the offensive side of our game," Hurdle said.	In the bottom of the seventh, reliever Bryan Morris hit pinch-hitter Jordany Valdespin with his first pitch. The night before, Valdespin hit a long home run and took plenty of time time admiring its trajectory.	When he returned to the dugout after the inning, he threw his helmet in the corner and tore off his batting gloves while no one acknowledged him. Over on the Pittsburgh side, Morris received fist bumps from manager Clint Hurdle and many of his teammates.	Through Mets team spokesman Jay Horwitz, Valdespin said the issue was closed and that he wasn't going to talk about it.	Niese gave up eight hits and three walks with a strikeout before leaving with one out in the fifth. He also allowed eight runs July 27 at Arizona last season.	"It's a tough time to go through this and I know the bullpen needs their rest. It's very frustrating not being able to go into the seventh inning, but, hopefully, it's something I'm going to work on and get it corrected," Niese said. "I think I created a bad habit of dropping down lower and kind of opening everything up. So, it's something I'm going to work on in the bullpen."	Game notes	  Saturday was Banner Day at Citi Field. Fans trooped Mets-themed banners around the warning track before the game, in the second year of revived tradition that had gone from 1963-1996. ... The Pirates have homered in 12 of their last 13 games and 19 of 22. ... New York has scored 31 runs in its last 12 home games. The 11 they allowed were a season worst at home. ... Pittsburgh right-hander Jeanmar Gomez (2-0) is expected to make his third start of the season in the finale of the four-game series on Sunday. He'll face Mets rookie RHP Matt Harvey (4-0). ... Tabata singled in the seventh for the third four-hit game of his career.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ST. LOUIS --  Shelby Miller retired the last 27 batters Friday night, finishing with a one-hitter. A day later, the St. Louis Cardinals rookie sat in the dugout and watched Adam Wainwright nearly top that feat.	Wainwright pitched no-hit ball into the eighth inning and finished with a two-hitter Saturday against the suddenly punchless Colorado Rockies in a 3-0 victory.	"I thought for sure he was going to throw a no-hitter," the 22-year-old Miller said. "He was locked in. We both threw well and his was exciting to watch, especially."	Wainwright doesn't mind getting pushed by the team's electric fifth starter who's 5-2 with a 1.58 ERA.	"You follow Roger Clemens a couple times like I have been, it makes you focus a little bit more," Wainwright said. "Once you see Shelby mow through a lineup like he has all year, you want to go out there and do it, too.	"Those guys will think there's a new sheriff in town," Wainwright added.	The Rockies had been hitless in 49 consecutive at-bats before Nolan Arenado lined a clean hit to center field with one out in the eighth. Eric Young led off Friday night's game with a broken-bat single off Miller then failed to put a runner on until Todd Helton walked with one out in the fifth inning a day later.	"I'm just trying to hit the ball hard," Arenado said. "I knew he wanted to get ahead with a strike and he threw one down and away. I got pretty lucky, I guess."	The 49 at-bats is the longest hitless stretch since Sept. 25-27, 1981, when the Los Angeles Dodgers went 50 at-bats without a knock, according to STATS.	"I thought we were going to witness something pretty special," manager Mike Matheny said. "You could see him finishing that off.	"What a great couple of days," Matheny said.	After the hit, Wainwright (5-2) doffed his cap in appreciation during a prolonged standing ovation from a sellout crowd of 43,050, then quickly retired the next two hitters. He gave up a two-out single to Dexter Fowler in the ninth and matched his career best with a two-hitter.	"About the third or fourth inning, I could tell he was throwing everything for a strike and was doing whatever he wanted to do," right fielder Allen Craig said. "You just never know how it's going to go from there, but that was a lot of  fun to be out there.	"He was close. Maybe next time," added Craig.	Wainwright struck out seven for his second shutout of the season and sixth of his career. The Rockies have been shut out for 26 consecutive innings since Carlos Gonzalez hit a first-inning sacrifice fly against the Yankees on Thursday, and have had just one runner in scoring position the first two games of the series.	The Rockies entered Saturday as the highest-scoring team in the National League. Manager Walt Weiss wasn't planning a meeting.	"You leave it alone," Weiss said. "You know, everyone gets beat up a little bit in this game at some point, but our guys will keep grinding and we'll to come out and try to turn it around (Sunday)."	Craig had three hits and a sacrifice fly and Yadier Molina had two hits and an RBI for the Cardinals, who have won nine of 10 and are a major league-best 23-12.	Wainwright has won five of his last six starts, recapturing his form as the staff ace in his second season coming off reconstructive elbow surgery. He has thrown a pair of two-hitters, the last on Aug. 6, 2010 at Florida.	Wainwright bounced back from his lone poor outing when he gave up five runs in 5 1/3 innings at Milwaukee his last time out. He's 5-1 against the Rockies.	"I wanted to get back to the basics after the last start," Wainwright said. "I wanted to attack the strike zone right away. Keep it simple, that was my focus today."	Wainwright and Miller retired 40 consecutive batters with 18 strikeouts before Helton walked. He was stranded when Arenado fouled out and Reid Brignac grounded out.	All things appeared headed toward the no-hitter after Matt Carpenter made a sliding stab of a grounder about 10 feet onto the outfield grass behind second base for the first out in the eighth. Wainright smiled broadly at the play. Arenado, though, then singled.	The Cardinals loaded the bases with one out in the second and fourth, both times with the eighth and ninth-place hitter coming up. Both times, Jhoulys Chacin (3-2) escaped by striking out Pete Kozma and Wainwright.	They loaded them again in the fifth on singles by Carpenter, Jon Jay and Matt Holliday and took the lead on Craig's sacrifice fly, with Matt Adams adding a two-out RBI single.	Matt Holliday, Craig and Molina hit consecutive singles off Josh Outman in the seventh to make it 3-0.	The Cardinals haven't thrown a no-hitter since Bud Smith at San Diego in 2001, and haven't had one at home since Bob Forsch threw the second of his career on Sept. 26, 1983, against the Expos.	Gonzalez and Troy Tulowitzki have each struck out five times the first two games.	Game notes	Carlos Beltran, 1 for 8 with double-play balls against Chacin, was not in the lineup. ... Lefty Jaime Garcia (4-1, 2.25) faces Jorge De La Rosa (3-3, 3.52) in the series finale Sunday. .. Chacin's comebacker to end the third ended a string of eight straight strikeouts by the pitcher's spot on both teams to start the series. ... At the start of Miller's one-hitter on Friday, the Rockies' 3-4-5 hitters took eight consecutive called strikes. ... Michael Cuddyer missed his third straight game with neck stiffness.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

BOSTON -- Mark Buehrle was in one of those rare grooves where he never thought he'd allow a hit. He's got the resume to know what that feels like.	Buehrle pitched shutout ball into the eighth inning before Toronto's bullpen blew a 2-0 lead and the Blue Jays rallied for a 3-2 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Saturday.	Adam Lind hit a tiebreaking homer off Boston closer Junichi Tazawa leading off the ninth to lift the struggling Blue Jays to just their fifth win in 16 games.	But it was Buehrle's day. He outdueled Clay Buchholz and put the Blue Jays in position to send Buchholz to his first loss of the season before the Red Sox came back.	"I felt like everytime I was throwing a pitch it was like, 'You're not going to hit it,'" the 35-year old left-hander said. "That's how I felt today."	And he should know, having tossed two no-hitters in his career, including a perfect game against Tampa Bay July 23, 2009.	After walking the leadoff batter in the eighth, Buehrle was pulled. Darren Oliver (2-1) got the win despite giving up the tying run.	"That's vintage Buerhle right there," Toronto manager John Gibbons said. "He had it going today. A tough day to pitch. A short left field wall and you had the wind the blowing out. That's as good as it gets."	Lind belted a 2-2 pitch from Tazawa (2-2) into the center field bleachers, sending Boston to its seventh loss in nine games.	Casey Janssen pitched the ninth for his 10th save in 10 chances. He allowed a leadoff double, but got the next three hitters.	It was Buchholz's first meeting with the Blue Jays since Toronto broadcaster Jack Morris accused him of throwing a spitball after he beat them in a game on May 1.	"He was normal, good," Lind said when asked about the controversy with Buchholz. "He doesn't need it -- a power sinker, cutter, curve. He's got everything you want in a starting pitcher."	Gibbons said, "That's over. We're not talking about it."	Buehrle had baffled Boston's batters for seven shutout innings, but he walked David Ross to open the eighth. Oliver relieved and Jacoby Ellsbury tripled over center fielder Colby Rasmus' head. One out later with the infield in, Dustin Pedroia's hard-hit grounder bounced off shortstop Munenori Kawasaki's glove and into short left, allowing Ellsbury to race home with the tying run. The play was ruled an error.	Buehrle was charged with a run, allowing five hits, striking out five and walking two.	Buchholz gave up two runs, six hits, striking out four and walking three in eight innings.	The start was delayed 51 minutes by rain before Buehrle and Buchholz began their work in a contest that saw the first seven innings played in about two hours.	"Both guys settled in and pitched extremely well on both sides," Boston manager John Farrell said. "Seemingly, after the second inning, Buehrle really settled into a very good rhythm. As we know he works extremely fast. Lived on the edge the whole game."	Buehrle had given up five runs or more in five of his previous seven starts, but he had the Red Sox hitters looking confused as he changed speeds, mixing a below-average speed fastball with cutters, curves and change-ups to get a number of off-balanced, poorly timed swings.	The left-hander retired 13 straight batters from the third through seventh innings, with Boston hitting just two balls out of the infield and striking out three times.	He needed just seven pitches in fifth and 12 in both the sixth and seventh.	Buchholz acknowledged how impressive Buehrle pitched.	"He's been around for a long time," he said. "It's not frustrating because of who he is. It's frustrating to lose in general."	Facing the Blue Jays for the first time since Morris' accusations that lasted into his next start, Buchholz breezed through a perfect first inning on eight pitches, throwing seven strikes and getting a strikeout.	But Toronto scored a run in both the third and fourth before Buchholz got into a groove, too.	The Blue Jays, who were two-hit over seven innings by Buchholz in that 8-0 loss to the Red Sox in Toronto, grabbed a 1-0 lead on Melky Cabrera's RBI single in the third.	In the fourth, Rasums' run-scoring single made it 2-0 after Lind singled leading off and advanced on Brett Lawrie's slow roller to third.	After the Blue Jays scored twice, Buchholz retired 11 of 12, walking one batter.	The Red Sox had two on and one out in the first and second, but Buehrle escaped both jams.	The Blue Jays placed OF Rajai Davis on the 15-day DL with a strained left oblique muscle before the game and recalled RHP Chad Jenkins from Double-A New Hampshire. ... Red Sox closer Joel Hanrahan said he needs season-ending surgery on his right forearm. The recovery time is expected to be six to nine months. ... Neither team had BP on the field with showers in the area. ... Heather Abbott, of Newport, R.I., who was injured in the Boston Marathon bombings, threw out the ceremonial first pitch to Boston C Jarrod Saltalamacchia. ... Buchholz remains unbeaten at 6-0.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

WASHINGTON -- Stephen Strasburg was at his dominant best in the early going Saturday, retiring 13 of the first 14 Chicago Cubs he faced, seven via strikeout.	And then it all fell apart for the Washington Nationals' right-hander after a teammate's error. The No. 1 overall draft pick in 2009 and NL All-Star in 2012 wound up dropping his fifth consecutive decision of 2013, slumping his shoulders and bowing his head while laboring through a 42-pitch fifth inning during an 8-2 loss to the Cubs.	"I tried to tell him ... 'You have to keep your head up, every time. You never can put your head down,' " Nationals catcher Wilson Ramos said. "Because every time, when he puts the head down, he loses focus."	Strasburg (1-5) hasn't won since Opening Day, April 1, against the lowly Miami Marlins.	"It's hard to explain. He was throwing good, good stuff. Hitting his spots," manager Davey Johnson said. "And then it seemed -- where we needed him to pick us up, the air went out."	The first of Washington third baseman Ryan Zimmerman's pair of errors came with two outs in the fifth of a scoreless game, an off-target throw (he made a fielding error in the seventh).	Strasburg followed with his first walk, to No. 8 hitter Darwin Barney, who has a .160 batting average. Then up came opposing pitcher Edwin Jackson, who delivered a full-count double to right-center that made it 2-0. That accounted for Jackson's first hit and RBIs of the season; he'd been 0 for 10.	"If Strasburg punches him out there," Cubs manager Dale Sveum said, "it's a whole different ballgame."	Unraveling, Strasburg walked another batter and gave up Starlin Castro's single to load the bases. Anthony Rizzo grounded a single up the middle, the ball bounding into center to score two more runs. Instead of backing up home plate on the play, Strasburg ambled around on the infield grass and looked into the dugout.	All four runs were unearned, and Strasburg's ERA actually dipped to 3.10.	"I feel like I'm going out there and pitching well. Just not happening on the days I pitch right now," Strasburg said. "It's all going to change. It's still early, and all I can do is just go out there and give everything I have every fifth day. Whatever happens, happens."	Jackson (1-5), meanwhile, retired 12 of Washington's first 13 batters and allowed two runs and four hits in 5 1/3 innings. He earned his first victory under a $52 million, four-year contract he signed after leaving Washington as a free agent, and in doing so, ended the Nationals' five-game winning streak.	"It was definitely nice to get that monkey off my back. ... It felt about the same size as me," Jackson said.	"When things are going bad, you can fold and collapse," he added, "or you can continue to work hard and climb your way out of the hole."	Sounds like advice Strasburg might want to heed.	He entered Saturday with a 3.45 ERA and was averaging 6 1/3 innings per start; his five-inning stint against Chicago was his shortest outing of the season. And, to think, he actually got some defensive help right before the problems arrived.	With one out in the fifth, Luis Valbuena laced a shot into the right-field corner for what should have been a stand-up double. Valbuena tried to stretch it into a triple and was thrown out at third, injuring the pinky on his right (throwing) hand in the process.	Strasburg, backing up third base on the play, pumped his right fist to celebrate.	Moments later, he was in a vastly different mood.	"He's too good a pitcher to let adversity behind him let him down," Johnson said. "He's certainly capable of picking us up. It's a team effort. And errors are a part of the game."	Shortstop Ian Desmond was asked whether he noticed Strasburg's demeanor change.	"It's hard to see emotion and things like that on the field, because I'm trying to watch the hitter, watch the pitch sequence, stuff like that. I would say (the media), the fans, things like that, probably have a little better visual of that than I do. But," Desmond said, pausing before adding, "it clearly wasn't the same."	Game notes	Desmond drove in both of Washington's runs. He had three hits -- a homer, double and single -- for the second game in a row. ... In the eighth, Cubs 1B Rizzo made a juggling catch of Zimmerman's popup to shallow right, tumbling head-over-heels and barely avoiding a collision with a teammate. ... Cubs 3B Valbuena was replaced in the bottom of the fifth because of the hurt finger, but Sveum said X-rays showed it wasn't broken. Sveum listed Valbuena as day-to-day. ... In Sunday's series finale, Nationals LHP Gio Gonzalez (3-2, 4.97 ERA) faces Cubs RHP Scott Feldman (3-3, 2.70).	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Madison Bumgarner didn't take any personal satisfaction from his first career victory over the Atlanta Braves.	There's no doubt what it meant to his team.	Bumgarner struck out a season-high 11 over seven innings, Gregor Blanco entered in the fifth as a pinch hitter and drove in four runs, and the San Francisco Giants routed the Atlanta Braves 10-1 on Saturday.	The North Carolina native grew up rooting for the Braves and had been winless against them in four previous starts. Bumgarner (4-1) gave up just four hits and walked two, winning for the first time since April 13.	"They've got as good a shot as anybody to play October baseball," Bumgarner said of the Braves. "When you play a team like that, you want to play your best baseball, too."	Blanco had a three-run double and triple in setting a career high for RBIs.	San Francisco's rotation, considered one of the best in the majors, has struggled early this season. But ace Matt Cain tossed eight innings of three-hit ball in Friday's win, and coupled with Bumgarner's effort, the Giants can claim the four-game series with a victory in Sunday's finale.	It was a frustrating day for the National League East-leading Braves. Dan Uggla struck out four times and Chris Johnson went down swinging three times. After a victory in Thursday's opener, the Braves have mustered just 10 hits and been outscored 18-3.	"He's nasty," Johnson said. "For me, he is one of the best lefties in the game. He throws his cutter in to righties. He makes righties feel uneasy."	They hurt themselves defensively Saturday, and lefty Paul Maholm (4-4) lasted just 4 1/3 innings and was charged with six runs on eight hits.	The Giants led 2-1 when they broke the game open with a four-run fifth, aided by the adventures of Braves right fielder Justin Upton.	Upton let Marco Scutaro's liner skip past him for a one-out triple. After Pablo Sandoval was hit by a pitch, Buster Posey drove an RBI double deep to right that Upton made an awkward attempt on as it bounced up against the wall. Hunter Pence was intentionally walked to load the bases, and Braves interim manager Carlos Tosca called on Cory Gearrin to relieve Maholm.	Giants manager Bruce Bochy sent up Blanco to hit for Francisco Peguero, and Blanco delivered a three-run double to right-center that extended the Giants' lead to 6-1.	"It is definitely a difficult outfield," Upton said. "You definitely have to make a decision pre-pitch on how aggressive you want to be."	Blanco was at it again in the eighth, when the Giants batted around and tacked on four more. His liner to left field skipped past a charging Evan Gattis and went for an RBI triple. Blanco is 9 for 19 this season with runners in scoring position.	San Francisco's starting pitchers entered the day with a 4.48 ERA, which ranked 13th out of 15 NL teams. Bumgarner rebounded after his worst outing of the season, when he gave up five runs in six innings against Philadelphia on Monday.	"That's a tough lineup to go through and he did quite a job for us," Bochy said.	Johnson, the Braves third baseman, struck out swinging in all three at-bats against Bumgarner.	"He's nasty," Johnson said. "For me, he is one of the best lefties in the game. He throws his cutter in to righties. He makes righties feel uneasy."	Sandoval's homer in the first gave the Giants an early lead. Brandon Crawford doubled in a run in the fourth to make it 2-0, one of two hits the left-handed hitting Crawford had off Maholm.	Maholm entered Saturday having yielded just four hits to lefties all season.	Game notes	Giants reliever Santiago Casilla was scheduled to run during batting practice to test his sore right knee, but Bochy wasn't planning on having Casilla available until Tuesday's road trip opener at Toronto. ... Tim Lincecum, who starts Sunday for San Francisco, has lost his last four starts against Atlanta. Kris Medlen will take the ball for the Braves, looking to snap a five-start winless streak. ... Scutaro has an 11-game hitting streak. ... Johnson is 0 for 17 with eight strikeouts this month.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CINCINNATI -- Jay Bruce has been getting pitches to hit all season. Lately, he's doing something with them.	Bruce homered his first time up, then doubled twice during a seven-run burst as the Cincinnati Reds delighted a sellout crowd, battering the Milwaukee Brewers 13-7 on Saturday.	"It's a long season," said Bruce, who's hit just three homers after leading the Reds with 34 last season. "I'm trying to get pitches to hit. Lately, I've been missing them less."	Manager Dusty Baker has seen his two-time All-Star starting to put it together.	"I told Jay he's on his way," Baker said. "You could tell the way he's been swinging the bat the last couple of days."	Six different Reds players drove in two runs each, including starting pitcher Mat Latos (4-0).	Baker never is comfortable against the hard-hitting Brewers.	"You've got to get a lot of run support," said Baker, whose defending NL Central champions moved five games over .500 for the first time this season. "Those guys can hit. You've got to keep scoring and scoring and scoring."	The bottom five hitters in Cincinnati's lineup were a combined 8-for-9 in the first three innings, scoring 10 runs and driving in six against Hiram Burgos (1-1). The rookie allowed 12 runs on 11 hits and three walks in those three innings.	"You feel kind of bad for the kid, but you can't be called off," Baker said. "You could tell it was going to be one of those-high scoring games."	Milwaukee manager Ron Roenicke felt as if he had no choice but to leave Burgos in the game.	"I don't ever want to do that to somebody again," he said. "We're hurting in the bullpen."	A promotion featuring Aroldis Chapman bobbleheads drew a crowd of 41,678. The Reds never needed their closer after romping early.	Bruce led off a five-run second that was helped by a pair of fielding mistakes by left fielder Ryan Braun. Bruce opened the seven-run third with a double and capped it with an RBI double that made it 12-4.	Bruce became the first Reds player with two hits in one inning since Drew Stubbs on April 25, 2011, at Milwaukee and the first Reds player with two doubles in one inning since Sean Casey on Aug. 7, 1998, also against Milwaukee.	Latos won his fourth straight start. He allowed a total of 14 runs in his previous seven starts, but gave up seven in this win, including solo homers by Jean Segura and Norichika Aoki.	"Give the `W' to the offense," a plainly disgusted Latos said. "They deserve it. I felt all right. I didn't allow myself to have my best stuff. I was aggravated with myself. It was a poor performance."	Latos got two hits and scored twice.	"I could't care less," he said. "I gave up seven runs. ... I couldn't care less about the hits."	Latos almost didn't last long enough to qualify for the win, Baker said.	"I was tempted (to pull Latos) in the fifth," Baker said. "I told him, `You're about to blow this victory.' We helped him."	Latos gave up a homer to Segura with one out in the first and Aramis Ramirez hit an RBI double off the wall later in the inning.	Baker believes the Brewers are even more dangerous with Segura, who's in his first full season with Milwaukee after being acquired from the Angels in the Zack Greinke deal last July.	"With Segura,you've got to score even more," Baker said. "He's a heck of a player. That was a heck of a trade."	After Bruce opened the Reds' second with a 437-foot homer for his second shot in three games, Braun allowed what looked like an easy fly ball by Xavier Paul to drop behind him for a two-base error. Braun later overthrew the cutoff man on Zack Cozart's sacrifice fly, allowing runners to advance and setting up Joey Votto's RBI groundout.	Milwaukee got two runs back in the third on Braun's RBI double and Ramirez's run-scoring single, but the Reds pulled away in the bottom half.	Cincinnati's spree included Latos' RBI groundball single up the middle through a drawn-in infield.	Aoki added his fourth homer of the season in the sixth.	Game notes	The win clinched the three-game series for the Reds, giving them six wins in seven home series this season. ... Reds OF Chris Heisey is scheduled to start a rehab assignment Monday at Double-A Pensacola. Heisey has been on the disabled list since April 29 with a strained right hamstring. ... For the first time in franchise history, the Reds wore red jerseys with "Los Rojos" written in script across the front. ... Aoki's strikeout leading off the game snapped at 37 his streak of consecutive plate appearances without fanning. ... RHP Bronson Arroyo (2-4) starts Sunday's series finale for the Reds against RHP Wily Peralta (3-2).	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- One swing of Evan Longoria's bat erased another night of frustration for the Tampa Bay Rays.	Longoria hit a two-run homer with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning off Padres closer Huston Street on Saturday night, rallying the Rays to an 8-7 victory over San Diego.	Street (0-2) retired the first two batters in the ninth before walking Ben Zobrist on a full count. Longoria followed with his ninth home run, handing Street his first blown save in nine tries this season.	"You need games like this, whether it's myself or anybody coming through in the clutch, to kind of boost morale and jump-start everything," Longoria said.	Failing to finish off Zobrist is what bothered Street the most.	"You get him 1-2, you've got to make a pitch," he said. "I'm frustrated about that just as much as leaving a pitch to Longoria in the middle of the plate."	It was the fourth straight win for the Rays, who had to come back after Jesus Guzman's pinch-hit grand slam off Jeremy Hellickson helped San Diego overcame a 6-2 deficit in the seventh. If the Padres had held on, it would have been the 14th game the Rays lost this season after leading. They had lost twice this week after taking big leads into the late innings.	"It would have been among the top three worst losses of the year," said manager Joe Maddon, who was uncharacteristically perturbed about another blown lead.	"That's not going to happen very often," Maddon said. "We were fortunate Longo was in the right spot, fortunate that Zo gets it as a hitter. You had all this talent coming together at that particular moment. But you can't go to the dance playing like that. When you get leads, you've got to put the other team away. I'm not happy with that. That's inappropriate. That's got to stop."	Cesar Ramos (1-0) got the win as the Rays moved up to .500 for the first time since April 7.	James Loney hit a two-run homer as the Rays roughed up San Diego's Burch Smith in the second inning of his major league debut. The Rays scored six runs on five hits and a couple of walks in the inning and drove Smith out of the game.	"I feel the difference between the first and second inning was I was locating the fastball better. The second inning I was leaving pitches over the plate," said Smith. "Hitters at this level are going to take advantage of mistakes. (I'll) come back next time and do better."	Hellickson retired 16 straight batters after giving up three hits, including Chase Headley's two-run homer, in the first.	Hellickson took a four-run lead into the seventh, when he walked Carlos Quentin to start the Padres' rally. After Guzman's slam, Quentin walked again in the same inning, this time with the bases loaded against Jamey Wright to force in the lead run that made it 7-6.	"It was a huge blow at the time, but our spirit didn't wane," Longoria said. "We stayed in the game, continued to have good at bats, and we're happy to get the results that we did."	Smith, a 23-year-old righty called up from Double-A San Antonio, got three quick outs, including a couple of strikeouts in his first inning. But he walked Longoria to lead off the second and Loney followed with his second homer of the season. Smith threw 26 pitches in the inning without getting an out. Tyson Ross finished the inning for the Padres and pitched four shutout innings of relief.	Hellickson pitched 6 2/3 innings, giving up six earned runs on six hits while striking out eight. He has had leads in each of his last four starts, but has not won any of them.	Game notes	San Diego optioned RHP Brad Boxberger to Triple-A Tucson to open a roster spot for Smith. Boxberger appeared in two games for the Padres. .... Padres LHP Clayton Richard, recovering from an intestinal virus and eligible to come off the disabled list on May 20, will pitch for Triple-A Tucson in a rehab game on Thursday . . . Rays CF and leadoff hitter Desmond Jennings was out of the lineup for the second straight night. Manager Joe Maddon said he's simply giving Jennings, who's batting .244 and has a season-best seven-game hitting streak, some rest. "I think with a little respite, this guy is going to be even better when he comes back. There's nothing wrong. I just want to give him a break," Maddon said. Sam Fuld made his second straight start in center field. . . . Smith was the 443rd player drafted in 2011 and the ninth to make it to the majors.

DETROIT -- On a night when it seemed the 27th out might never come for the Cleveland Indians, Chris Perez threw one last fastball to Miguel Cabrera and hoped the Detroit slugger would hit it on the ground.	"He chopped it," Perez said. "I wanted him to put something in play, but down. Luckily, he did."	Perez got Cabrera to hit a game-ending groundout with two on in the ninth inning, and Cleveland held on for a 7-6 win over the Tigers on Saturday night. Ubaldo Jimenez outpitched Justin Verlander, but Detroit's late rally forced the Indians to sweat out a tense finish.	Perez came on to pitch the ninth with Cleveland ahead 7-5. He was in a jam after a one-out error by first baseman Nick Swisher and a single by Omar Infante, but second baseman Jason Kipnis made a sparkling play behind second, fielding Austin Jackson's grounder up the middle and flipping behind his back to shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera for a force.	"Awesome -- that saved me," Perez said. "It made up for Swish's play. Baseball kind of works out that way. He picked me up."	That was out No. 26. The Indians still needed one more, and Torii Hunter's RBI single gave Miguel Cabrera another trip to the plate with men on first and second.	The count ran from 0-2 to 3-2, but Cabrera -- who entered the day leading the majors in batting average and RBIs -- hit a slow grounder to third to end it.	It was Perez's sixth save.	"We fought tooth and nail to get the right guy up there," Tigers manager Jim Leyland said. "I'll take that situation every time, but even that guy can't come through every time. We just put ourselves in too big a hole."	Verlander (4-3) was erratic early, allowing three runs in the first two innings. He settled down a bit after that, but the Indians took a 6-1 lead before Detroit closed the gap with a four-run seventh.	Jimenez (3-2) allowed a run and three hits in six innings, striking out eight with one walk. He's won three straight starts for the first time since the Indians acquired him in a trade in 2011.	Jhonny Peralta hit a solo homer for Detroit.	Swisher opened the scoring with an RBI double in the first, and Jason Giambi drew a bases-loaded walk to make it 2-0. That was Verlander's third walk of the first inning.	The Detroit ace got the first two outs of the second but allowed another run when Kipnis hit a single and Asdrubal Cabrera followed with a double.	"My fastball control just wasn't good at all," Verlander said. "I was trying to get ahead with the fastball and then throw off-speed stuff, hoping I could grind out six innings, but I didn't even do that."	Verlander allowed six hits and five walks in five innings, striking out seven and leaving after 110 pitches. After Peralta's homer got the Tigers on the board in the third, Cleveland added an unearned run off Verlander in the fifth to make it 4-1.	Swisher walked to lead off that inning, and Carlos Santana hit what looked like a double play grounder to first baseman Prince Fielder, who stepped on first and threw to second to trap Swisher between bases. Miguel Cabrera, the third baseman, was involved in the rundown because a defensive shift had him playing close to second, and he threw the ball away for an error. Swisher eventually scored on a two-out single by Mark Reynolds.	Asdrubal Cabrera's RBI single in the sixth made it 5-1, and pinch-hitter Mike Aviles added a run-scoring single of his own in the seventh, but the Cleveland bullpen almost gave up the lead. Jimenez left after 93 pitches, and Nick Hagadone allowed a double and two walks to start the Detroit seventh.	Cody Allen came on and allowed a sacrifice fly to pinch-hitter Brayan Pena. Infante added a two-run triple and scored on Jackson's groundout to make it 6-5.	A sacrifice fly by Giambi in the eighth gave Cleveland an insurance run the Indians would end up needing.	When Jimenez was acquired two years ago, the Indians hoped they were getting an ace who could help them compete with teams like the Tigers. The right-hander hasn't come close to expectations, but he's pitching better now.	"I think it's all about my mechanics," Jimenez said. "I think the last three games I've been able to repeat my mechanics with every pitch."	This was Cleveland's seventh game this season against a former Cy Young Award winner, and the Indians are 6-1 in those games.	Game notes	It rained a bit early in the game, but not hard enough to halt play. ... Peralta and Miguel Cabrera extended their hitting streaks to 10 games. ... Fielder was hit in the left thigh in the eighth and went hobbling toward the mound, but he wasn't charging reliever Joe Smith. He was just trying to run through the pain a bit and his momentum took him in the direction of the pitcher. ... Jimenez's previous three-start winning streak was in July 2011, less than a month before the trade to Cleveland. ... The Indians have not lost any of their last six series. The rubber game of this three-game set is Sunday, with Cleveland's Zach McAllister (3-3) facing Detroit's Rick Porcello (1-2).	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

CHICAGO --  After a slow start, Mike Trout is showing signs of getting back to his dominant 2012 form.	Trout hit a two-run homer and Jerome Williams pitched into the seventh inning to help the Los Angeles Angels beat the Chicago White Sox 3-2 on Saturday night.	Williams (2-1) allowed two runs and scattered seven hits in 6 2/3 innings. He struck out three and walked one. After eight appearances out of the bullpen, Williams made his second start after he replaced the struggling Garrett Richards, who was filling in for injured Los Angeles ace Jered Weaver.	Alberto Callaspo led off the game with a bloop single, two pitches later, Trout put the Angels ahead with a two-run shot to left for his sixth of the season. The home run was Trout's fourth in 10 games.	"It was about 130 games last year he was pretty good. You're not going to be locked in all the time, but there is no doubt he is finding a comfort zone in the box and it is good to see him drive the ball," said Scioscia.	White Sox starter Jose Quintana (2-1) allowed three runs in the loss. He gave up five hits and struck out five.	The Angels tied a season-high three-game winning streak, but are currently nine games behind the Rangers in the AL West and are finally showing signs of getting back to the top of the standings.	"Everything is getting back to normal, playing like how we are supposed to be playing baseball. Everybody is doing their jobs, shut-down innings and everyone is swinging the bat. Everything is turning around now," Williams said.	Scott Downs got one out in the seventh, Richards pitched a perfect eighth and Ernesto Frieri pitched a scoreless ninth for his seventh save in eight chances.	"I think the one thing you can point to is our bullpen. Our bullpen has responded to the challenge of getting outs that we need," said Scioscia.	It was Williams' first win as a starter since June 1, 2012 against the Rangers.	"I didn't really have my best stuff but I battled through it any way possible," said Williams.	The White Sox, who committed three errors, have lost eight of its last 12 games.	"Everybody's working. It's a tough thing sometimes," White Sox first baseman Paul Konerko said. "This year, it's been the mistakes we make, the hits we don't get. It's coming from a place of trying too hard."	The White Sox loaded the bases in the second inning. With two outs, Tyler Greene hit a slow roller to shortstop Brendan Harris. Harris fielded the ball while moving to his left, but his throw to first was off-balanced and late, allowing Paul Konerko to score. Alejandro De Aza followed with an RBI single to right to tie the game, Jeff Keppinger tried to score from second on De Aza's single but was thrown out at the plate by Josh Hamilton.	The Angels got the lead back in the third inning thanks to an error and a passed ball.	With two outs, Hamilton hit a routine grounder to Greene at second base. Greene made a lackadaisical throw to first base that got away from Dunn. Albert Pujols, who was on first, advanced to third on Greene's throwing error. Pujols later scored when catcher Tyler Flowers couldn't keep Quintana's pitch to Howie Kendrick in front of him. On Flowers' flip, Quintana had a shot to tag Pujols at the plate, but Pujols avoided the tag with his slide.	The three errors in the game for the White Sox tied the Angels for most errors in the American League with 27.	"I don't think that's anything mental. Not being in the right position or things like that. Physical stuff, you get. But you know it's just one of those that you do have to do it better. It's that simple," said White Sox manager Robin Ventura.	Game notes	 White Sox INF Conor Gillaspie was scratched from the White Sox lineup due to an upper respiratory infection. Keppinger moved to third base and Greene started at second base. ... Angels reliever Ryan Madson (Tommy John recovery) threw one inning in an extended-spring training game on Saturday. Angels manager Mike Scioscia was encouraged with Madson's velocity, which was between 91-94 mph. He will pitch again on Monday then receive his minor league rehab assignment. ... INF Erick Aybar missed his second straight game with tightness in his right hamstring. ... By taking the first two games of the series, the Angels won its third series of the season. ... Dunn struck out three times to drop his average to .137.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Andy Pettitte finally stopped beating himself up long enough to look at video of his past couple of outings, subpar efforts by any stretch and certainly his own lofty standards.	It turned out that all the 40-year-old left-hander needed to do was a make a couple of minor adjustments -- alter his arm angle ever so slightly, for one thing -- to get back on track.	Pettitte pitched seven stellar innings Saturday night, and Vernon Wells hit a go-ahead two-run homer before making a long running catch for the final out, giving the New York Yankees a 3-2 win over the Kansas City Royals.	Pettitte (4-2) allowed seven runs against Houston and only lasted five innings his last time out against Oakland. But he looked more like he did early in the season against the Royals, with a piercing cutter and pinpoint control that kept Kansas City at bay all night.	"Whenever you get knocked around, it's not a good feeling. You never want that doubt to creep in that you're not able to get it done," Pettitte said. "Hopefully I can continue to get sharper and sharper."	Pettitte allowed only a run-scoring groundout by Lorenzo Cain and a solo homer by Billy Butler while improving to 15-3 in his career against the Royals. Kansas City hasn't beaten him in 14 starts dating to Sept. 4, 2000.	"I really don't think he's forgotten how to pitch, forgotten how to throw a cutter or any of that," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "I always say, when you're old or overweight -- and you don't want to be both -- and you're struggling, people are always going to be saying, 'Is something wrong? Is something wrong?' It's baseball. Everyone struggles."	Everyone except Mariano Rivera, it seems.	After David Robertson struck out the side in the eighth, Rivera worked around a two-out double by Salvador Perez for his 14th save. But it wasn't without some tension: Mike Moustakas hit a liner to right that landed just foul, and then scorched a pitch into the left-center field gap that Wells tracked down on the run to end the game.	It was Rivera's 14th save to start the season, and his 28th straight against the Royals. It came just over a year after he tore the ACL in his right knee while shagging balls in the Kauffman Stadium outfield during batting practice.	"I think Mo said it best, as an athlete, you can get hurt anywhere," Girardi said. "It just happened to be here. ... I'm sure it was good for him to get out there."	James Shields (2-3) was hurt by a throwing error on Moustakas at third base in the second inning that resulted in the Yankees' first run. He also gave up Wells' two-run shot in the fifth, moments after Butler's home run had staked Kansas City to 2-1 lead.	Shields wound up going eight innings for the third time in his last four outings, and each of those times he's failed to pick up the win. He dropped to 7-15 in his career against New York.	"You've got to pitch better," Shields said. "That's it."	It was the Royals' fifth loss in six games.	"Andy Pettitte threw the ball great," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "Kept the ball down. Changes speeds. Hit his spots really well. We never mounted much of an attack."	The bounces certainly seemed to be going the Yankees' way most of the night.	Travis Hafner hit a slow grounder toward first base in the fourth inning, and Shields and first baseman Eric Hosmer had trouble deciding who should grab it. Neither of them did until it was too late, and Hafner coasted across the bag for an infield single.	Lyle Overbay hit another grounder in the sixth inning that Elliot Johnson fielded at second base, but only after shortstop Alcides Escobar bumped into him. The slight hiccup allowed Jayson Nix to reach second safely and Overbay to be safe at first.	Meanwhile, a hard-hit ball by Moustakas leading off the seventh inning caromed off Pettitte's glove and right to Robinson Cano. The Yankees' second baseman made the soft toss to first, turning a potential base hit into an easy groundout.	Cano had another rough night in Kansas City, though.	The Yankees' All-Star was booed mercilessly for the second straight night by Royals fans who no doubt still remember his decision to snub Butler for the AL squad during last year's home run derby, which was hosted by the Royals as part of All-Star festivities.	Cano went 0 for 4 and struck out looking in the seventh, arguing with plate umpire Mark Wegner over the third strike. First base coach Mick Kelleher got between them and Girardi also ran onto the field to make sure Cano wouldn't be tossed from the game.	Game notes	The Yankees plan to use a pitcher to fill the 26th player on the roster for Monday's doubleheader at Cleveland. Girardi didn't know who it would be. ...

MINNEAPOLIS -- One night after its bullpen struggled mightily, the Minnesota Twins got a stellar performance from a different group of nonstarters.	Brian Duensing pitched two innings of scoreless relief, Casey Fien got two outs and Jared Burton earned his first save with a perfect ninth as the Twins beat the Baltimore Orioles 8-5 on Saturday night.	Ryan Doumit homered and Joe Mauer and Justin Morneau each had three hits for the Twins.	Vance Worley struggled through 5 1/3 innings, but earned his first win in 13 starts dating to Aug. 1, 2012.	Baltimore got within 6-5 in the sixth to chase Worley, and had runners on first and second when Duensing came into the game. The left-hander promptly got Nick Markakis to ground into a double play to end the threat.	"That kind of turned the momentum back in our direction," Duensing said. "With that team, momentum can be troublesome. They're a good offensive team."	Josh Roenicke gave up three runs late in Friday's game and Anthony Swarzak allowed three in the 10th inning as Baltimore overcame a six-run deficit to win 9-6.	"I think just for confidence for the whole group out there to do what we did tonight was real important," Duensing said.	Fien got the final two outs of the eighth inning and Burton retired the Orioles No. 2-4 hitters -- Manny Machado, Markakis and Adam Jones -- for a perfect ninth. Minnesota's normal closer, Glen Perkins, was unavailable with left side soreness.	"Burty told me last night after the game that he's feeling really good, he feels like he's found his pitches and the ball is coming out of his hand real good," manager Ron Gardenhire said.	Doumit hit his third home run of the season in the sixth, a two-run shot into the second deck in left field to give Minnesota a little breathing room at 8-5.	Worley (1-4) gave up 11 hits and five earned runs. He struck out one but threw 111 pitches.	He left balls up in the zone and was hit hard in the opening frame when Baltimore took a 3-0 lead. Machado and Jones had doubles, and Markakis and Chris Davis had RBI singles in the inning. Matt Wieters added a sacrifice fly to deep left-center.	"After that I went out there and I wasn't thinking so much," Worley said. "I'm here for a reason. I got to the big leagues pitching and I don't need to think too much about what I need to do out there, just make my pitches."	He got out a bases-loaded jam in the fifth by getting J.J. Hardy to fly out, and allowed an RBI single in the sixth before being pulled.	"I'm just glad (Duensing) came in and finished it for me," Worley said.	Making his season debut for the Orioles, starter Steve Johnson (0-1) cruised through the first two innings, before he began to get behind in counts and the Twins took advantage.	Trailing 4-2 and with two outs in the fourth, Brian Dozier laced a two-run double into the left-field corner to tie it. After an intentional walk to Mauer and a walk to Doumit, Morneau lined a two-run single over the shortstop for a 6-4 lead.	"I couldn't get a good feel for my pitches," said Johnson, who was optioned back to Triple-A after the game. "I couldn't get my secondary stuff over. I started off all right, but I couldn't make a pitch to get out of that inning. It's unfortunate that the team gives you that lead they gave you to not being able to make a pitch and limit the damage. It's not good."	Johnson, who was 4-0 with a 2.11 ERA in 12 games (four starts) for Baltimore last season, hoped to make the Orioles as the team's fifth starter out of spring training, but strained his right lat muscle in late-March. In three Triple-A rehab starts, the right-hander was 1-1 with a 4.41 ERA.	In four innings, he allowed seven hits and six earned runs while striking out three. However, he walked four batters and just 48 of his 88 pitches were strikes.	"Steve came out, hot and ready to go, started out really well, just couldn't maintain it," manager Buck Showalter said. "The first two innings, same type of approach (as last year). He's got some late life on his fastball. The curveball wasn't really there like it normally is. He got some outs with his changeup, but he then he elevated some that hurt him."	Trailing 3-0, Eduardo Escobar doubled leading off the bottom of the third and scored on a double by Mauer. It was the 600th career RBI for Mauer, who scored on Morneau's single.	Wieters homered in the fourth for a 4-2 Baltimore lead.	Game notes	With Johnson being sent down, the Orioles will make a corresponding roster move Sunday. ... Johnson is the ninth pitcher to start for Baltimore this season, tying the Orioles with the Los Angeles Dodgers for most in the majors. ... To make room for Johnson on the roster, Baltimore optioned RHP Alex Burnett to Triple-A Norfolk. ... With Twins LF Josh Willingham getting the day off, Doumit hit third for the first time since Sept 16, 2011, when he was with Pittsburgh. ... Wei-Yin Chen (2-3, 3.40) is scheduled to start for Baltimore on Sunday against Scott Diamond (3-2, 3.03).

HOUSTON -- There's something about the sixth inning in the last week for Nelson Cruz.	He's hit game-tying home runs in the frame in three games in a week for the Texas Rangers.	The latest one came on Saturday night when Cruz, Adrian Beltre and Lance Berkman all homered to back up another solid outing by Yu Darvish, and the Rangers held on for an 8-7 win over the Houston Astros.	His first one came Sunday in a win over Boston, and he also did it in a victory over Houston Friday.	"I wish we could play the sixth inning to start every (game)," Texas manager Ron Washington said. "That was a big hit. That was a real big hit."	Cruz struggled to quantify what's been different for him lately.	"I guess I get more focused," said Cruz, who has nine homers this season. "It's something you can't explain; it's baseball. It's something I've been doing all my career, late in the innings making sure I get my focus."	Darvish (6-1) yielded three hits and three runs, leaving after the seventh with an 8-3 lead. In his previous outing against the Astros, he came within one out of pitching a perfect game at Houston on April 2.	Matt Dominguez homered twice off Darvish. Dominguez didn't play in the first game against the Japanese star this season.	"I think the only thing he struggled with today was Dominguez," Washington said. "Other than that, I thought he did a good job. He handled the rest of the lineup. He just threw two pitches to Dominguez that he didn't miss."	Darvish didn't think any player had ever taken him deep more than once in a game before Saturday, but then he realized that wasn't true.	"That's what I thought, but then I recalled in high school I think I gave up two home runs to the same hitter in a game," he said through a translator.	Dominguez, who didn't have a homer before Saturday, was excited to face Darvish, since he missed him the first time around.	"That's kind of big for me," he said. "I was waiting for my first home run to come, and it took a while. But to go out and face him and be able to do it off him, such a great pitcher, it's a big confidence boost."	Houston led 3-1 before it was done in by its bullpen during a six-run sixth inning by the Rangers. Cruz, who also homered on Friday night, got things going with his two-run homer off reliever Philip Humber (0-8) that tied it. Pinch-hitter David Murphy put the Rangers on top with an RBI double.	Humber, who was moved out of the rotation this week, was rocked for five hits and five runs while getting only two outs.	"Obviously that one is on me," Humber said. "I didn't execute some pitches I needed to execute, and they made me pay for it."	The Astros scored three times in the ninth to cut the lead to one run, but closer Joe Nathan settled down to retire pinch-hitter Chris Carter to end it and get his 11th save.	Darvish fanned eight and leads the majors with 80 strikeouts. With 301 career strikeouts, he joined Dwight Gooden (319) as the only pitchers in major league history to reach at least 300 in their first 37 major league starts.	Darvish improved to 3-0 with 33 strikeouts in three career starts against the Astros.	The Houston bullpen trouble ruined a nice night for starter Erik Bedard, who allowed four hits and two runs with seven strikeouts in five innings.	Beltre put Texas up 1-0 with a solo homer to start the second.	Darvish retired the first seven batters before Dominguez launched a solo drive in the third. Marwin Gonzalez, who singled to break up Darvish's perfect game with two outs in the ninth last month, followed with an infield hit.	Dominguez's two-run homer in the fifth put Houston ahead 3-1. It was the first multihomer game of his career.	Berkman extended his hitting streak at Minute Maid Park to 17 games with a single to start the sixth inning that chased Bedard. Humber took over and struck out Beltre before the trouble began.	Cruz tied it at 3 with a homer that landed in Houston's bullpen in right-center field. Moreland followed with a soaring triple, which landed on Tal's Hill just in front of the center-field wall at the 436-foot mark. Murphy's ground-rule double made it 4-3.	Geovany Soto walked, pinch-hitter Leonys Martin hit a two-run triple and Elvis Andrus had an RBI single for a 7-3 lead, chasing Humber.	Berkman hit a solo homer to left-center field off Jose Cisnero to start the seventh inning.	A sacrifice fly by Jose Altuve got Houston within 8-4 in the eighth inning.	Carlos Corporan singled and Carlos Pena doubled to start Houston's ninth, and the Rangers replaced Michael Kirkman with Nathan.	Trevor Crowe hit an RBI single to make it 8-6, Nathan threw a wild pitch that scored a run and Gonzalez had a sacrifice fly. Robbie Grossman walked before Carter's fly ball ended the game.	Game notes	Murphy was shaken up when he crashed into the wall in left field trying to catch a double by Grossman in the eighth inning, but he remained in the game and Washington said he was OK. ... Texas pitching coach Mike Maddux missed Saturday's game to attend daughter Makayla's graduation from TCU. Bullpen coach Andy Hawkins filled in for him, and minor league pitching coordinator Danny Clark joined the team as bullpen coach for the night. ... Houston OF Fernando Martinez cleared waivers and will be outrighted to Triple-A Oklahoma City. ... OF Rick Ankiel, who was released by Houston on Monday, has cleared unconditional release waivers and can sign with any club. ... The series wraps up on Sunday when Houston's Jordan Lyles opposes Nick Tepesch.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PHOENIX -- With his team struggling to score runs behind him, Cliff Lee pitched in himself.	Lee threw seven scoreless innings and helped out with three sacrifice bunts as the Philadelphia Phillies beat Arizona 3-1 Saturday night, ending the Diamondbacks' five-game winning streak.	"It feels good to bunt a guy over and watch him score," said Lee, who said he hadn't been asked to bunt in three straight plate appearances before. "It makes you feel like you contributed."	In fact, twice Lee's bunts set up runs.	Lee (4-2) gave up six hits, struck out three and walked two in winning consecutive road starts for the first time since August 2011.	Philadelphia had been shut out in two of Lee's past starts and the Phillies have scored 23 runs total in his seven starts -- eight coming in one game.	"I just need to keep grinding and give the team a chance to win every time," he said.	The Diamondbacks threatened against Lee only once, loading the bases with two outs in the seventh while trailing 2-0 before Wil Nieves grounded out.	"I really didn't pay attention to the bullpen, to be honest with you," Lee said. "I never want to come out, and with the bases loaded, for sure."	Jimmy Rollins had two hits and drove in two runs. Domonic Brown added an RBI single in the seventh for the Phillies, who snapped a three-game losing streak.	"I usually have success when I get runners on, though not so much this year," Rollins said. "Obviously, you adjust your swing because you've got to get a good swing first. Now that I'm starting to get there, the confidence comes that I can put on the same swing in any situation."	Jonathan Papelbon pitched the final 1 2/3 innings for his sixth save in as many chances.	The Diamondbacks put runners on second and third against Papelbon with one out in the ninth. He struck out pinch-hitter Eric Hinske and A.J. Pollock for his first five-out save since July 14, 2012, at Colorado. Pollock had doubled twice earlier.	"Yeah, I asked him to do it," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said. "But I don't like doing that."	Arizona starter Trevor Cahill (2-4) could commiserate with Lee's lack of offensive support. The Diamondbacks have scored 22 runs in his seven starts, nine coming in a 9-2 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers on May 6.	"We had a chance to win tonight but things didn't go our way," Arizona manager Kirk Gibson said. "Any runs that they tacked on, you know it's going to make it tougher on yourself."	Cahill allowed only three hits and one run in five innings, struck out five but walked four.	"I felt like I was fighting myself the whole time," Cahill said.	The Phillies manufactured a run to take a 1-0 lead in the fifth. Ben Revere walked, was sacrificed to second by Lee, went to third on a wild pitch and scored on a sacrifice fly to deep center by Rollins.	Philadelphia made it 2-0 in the seventh when Revere singled off Josh Collmenter, stole second, moved up on Lee's third bunt and scored when Rollins singled.	Michael Young walked and later scored on Brown's single against Tony Sipp in the eighth to extend the Phillies' lead to 3-0.	"We just need to stay balanced," Manuel said. "We don't need to get down or anything. We need to stay even-keeled and come out every day like we're going to hit, keep your head up and keep going at it. If you don't hit, there ain't anything you can do about it but go out and try to be more prepared the next day."	Game notes	Diamondbacks RHP Matt Reynolds notched his 22nd scoreless appearance dating back to last season. He matched a franchise record with his 19th straight scoreless outing to start the season, first set by Joe Paterson in 2011. ... Phillies 1B Ryan Howard went 0 for 5 with four strikeouts. Since homering in his final at-bat Tuesday at San Francisco, Howard is 0 for 14 with nine strikeouts, dropping his batting average from .320 to .252. ... Pollock leads the NL with 14 doubles. ... Lee helped his cause in the third when he picked off Pollock at second base. ... Diamondbacks LHP Daniel Hudson, who is working his way back from Tommy John surgery last July, threw 46 pitches over three innings of a simulated game earlier Saturday. ... Arizona OF Adam Eaton has been transferred to Visalia of the Class A California League to continue his rehab from a left elbow strain. ... Phillies RHP Kyle Kendrick will start the series finale Sunday against Diamondbacks RHP Brandon McCarthy, who is looking for his first win since signing with Arizona in the offseason. Kendrick is unbeaten in his past six starts, posting a 4-0 record and allowing two or fewer runs in each game.

SEATTLE -- After losing five games in a row, the Oakland Athletics were ready for something to go right. So when Josh Donaldson gave the A's an early lead with a solo home run in the second inning, his teammates got a confidence boost.	"It was nice," Donaldson said. "I could tell on the bench a little bit, everybody could just -- there was a little sigh of relief. We got a lead, and let's play the game the way we know how."	A couple more homers by Daric Barton and Brandon Moss helped Oakland add to the lead, just enough to hold off the Seattle Mariners' late comeback attempts as the Athletics earned a 4-3 win Saturday night.	Jarrod Parker (2-5) did his part on the mound, holding the Mariners hitless until Kelly Shoppach's two-out, two-run homer on a 3-2 pitch in the fifth inning.	Parker left in the seventh after giving up another two hits and a run. From there, the Mariners made several pushes for a comeback but came up short, stranding runners in scoring position in each of the last three innings as the Athletics' bullpen kept pitching out of jams.	"That's something they do," Parker said. "They're a confident bunch of guys. For them to get themselves in a little bit of trouble, I don't think they fret. Nobody else does."	Jed Lowrie had three hits and an RBI for Oakland, which ended its season-long losing streak.	The Mariners were hoping starter Brandon Maurer (2-5) would benefit from 10 days rest -- his spot in the rotation was skipped after he gave up four runs in four innings against Baltimore on April 30 -- but the rookie had another tough outing, allowing three runs on six hits in five innings.	"It took a while to settle in there, so I was rushing quite a bit at the beginning," Mauer said.	Donaldson opened the scoring in the second, hitting his fifth homer into the visitors' bullpen in left field. The Mariners barely escaped falling behind further after Maurer walked Derek Norris and Eric Sogard -- the Nos. 8 and 9 hitters -- on eight straight pitches. Second baseman Dustin Ackley ranged to his left and made a diving stop of John Jaso's grounder in the hole to end the inning.	Barton added his first homer of the year in the fourth inning to make the score 2-0, and the Athletics added another run in the fifth as Seth Smith doubled and scored on Lowrie's RBI single.	"When you score early, it's always huge," Barton said. "Especially right now with the funk we were in."	The Mariners' offense couldn't muster more than a few walks until their half of the fifth, when Shoppach hit his second homer of the season to right field with two outs and a man on.	Moss hit his solo homer in the sixth to push Oakland's lead to 4-2.	The Mariners mounted several comeback efforts in the late innings. Justin Smoak and Raul Ibanez hit back-to-back one-out singles off Parker in the seventh, who was relieved by Sean Doolittle. Ackley then followed with another single to score Smoak before Doolittle got out of the jam.	The 6 1/3 innings tied Parker's longest outing this season.	"We want to get him on a roll," Oakland manager Bob Melvin said. "One good start's one thing, but we'd like to see him get on a roll. And certainly, with losing a few games in a row, it was a performance we needed out of him."	Reliever Ryan Cook came on in the eighth and gave up two singles and a walk, loading the bases with two outs. Endy Chavez, who had come on as a pinch runner for Ibanez in the seventh, struck out to end the rally -- Cook's third strikeout of the inning.	Grant Balfour pitched the ninth for his sixth save in six chances. The Mariners did have men on second and first with two outs, but Balfour got Kyle Seager to ground out for the final out.	"It's a good feeling to win," Balfour said. "I just thought it was an all-around great game tonight."	Game notes	Oakland OF Chris Young (strained left quadriceps) will start a rehab assignment Monday at extended spring training in Arizona, and manager Bob Melvin said he hopes Young will be activated from the DL on Wednesday. ... Ibanez started in LF for Seattle for the second straight game. Manager Eric Wedge said he's trying to help the veteran get comfortable at the plate, although Jason Bay will likely start Sunday. Ibanez was 1 for 3. ... The Mariners are now 1-12 when their starting pitcher doesn't complete the sixth inning and 0-17 when trailing after seven innings.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

LOS ANGELES -- The Dodgers don't like the view from the NL West basement, and Saturday night they did something about it.	Andre Ethier had a pair of doubles among his season-high four hits, Dee Gordon hit a rare home run and Los Angeles snapped an eight-game losing streak with a 7-1 victory over the Miami Marlins.	"It feels great to shake hands after a game," catcher A.J. Ellis said. "Every win is important and every win counts. And when you're in the midst of a losing streak, you definitely want to break it as soon as you can."	"Hopefully it's something we can build on. Having great at-bats, getting guys on and moving guys up and getting guys in has been our struggle this year. So tonight was good for us," he said.	The Dodgers have had four losing streaks longer than eight games since moving from Brooklyn to Los Angeles in 1958. Two of them were nine games (1973 and 1987), the others 10 games each (1961 and 1992). The franchise record is 16, which occurred in 1944.	"It all starts with one win," center fielder Matt Kemp said. "Right now everybody's having fun, and the kids are laughing and running around in the clubhouse. We missed that. I don't think anybody wanted to be around kids until they got home, because of the way the locker room has been the last week."	"We want to see everybody happy. I think a lot of us looked good at the plate tonight and I'm just glad we got a win. We've just got to keep grinding this thing out and take it game by game," he said.	Hyun-Jin Ryu (4-2) allowed one run and five hits in 6 2/3 innings. The left-hander took a three-hit shutout into the seventh before Miguel Olivo homered.	Ethier's four-hit game was his first since last Aug. 24-25, when he had back-to-back four-hit efforts against the Marlins at Dodger Stadium -- each of which included a home run. The two-time All-Star is batting .403 against the Marlins during his eight-year career.	"He's been grinding and working so hard in the cage to get his swing right," Ellis said. "I was with him today down there with (coaches) Mark McGwire and John Valentin, and they really put a good session in. They had a new plan of attack and he was able to execute. Those were four great at-bats and four great swings.	"One of the highlights for me as a player is hitting behind Andre at Dodger Stadium and being in the on-deck circle while he's hitting. It's such a pretty picture for me to see that open side when he's squaring the ball up and doing that. It's fun to watch," Ellis said.	Kevin Slowey (1-3) gave up five runs, 11 hits and three walks in 4 2/3 innings.	"We just went in there against him being ready to hit," said Adrian Gonzalez, who got two hits. "He's got a sneaky fastball, and we knew it going in from the guys that have already faced him. Don't let the radar gun fool you. Even though it's in the 80s to low 90s (mph), it feels harder. It plays harder. He's not the kind of guy you want to let get the ball deep on you because it'll be by you. So you have to treat him like a hard thrower."	Slowey, who pitched seven scoreless innings of two-hit ball against Philadelphia last weekend, hasn't won consecutive starts since Sept. 12-18, 2010 with Minnesota. He acknowledged that it was a battle for him.	"There will be those games over the course of the season, and you hope to survive it probably a little better than I did today," Slowey said. "I made some good pitches that they were able to fight off into the outfield. And when I left the ball over the plate, they hit it pretty well. I had opportunities to get out of some innings, and work around some walks. I just have to execute a little better earlier in counts."	Ethier led off the Dodgers' second with a double, ending a drought of 30 at-bats between extra-base hits. He advanced on Ellis' first sacrifice bunt of the season and scored the game's first run on a broken-bat bloop single by Skip Schumaker.	Gordon led off the third with a drive that just cleared the fence in right-center. It was his second homer in the big leagues and first since May 1, 2012.	"Slowey has been great," Marlins manager Mike Redmond said. "Today, you could tell he was battling from the start. But he went out there and continued to compete and tried to keep us in the game. That's what he's done. He's done a great job for us. Today was a little bump in the road. Offensively, we didn't really get anything going either."	Schumaker, starting at second base for the sixth time in 13 games while Mark Ellis has been sidelined with a right quad strain, turned in the defensive play of the game in the fifth -- robbing Matt Diaz of a hit with a diving stop in the hole and throwing him out with runners at first and second to end a Marlins threat.	"(Dodgers third base coach) Tim Wallach moved me the pitch before. He's always looking at charts and he's right on top of everything," Schumaker said.	In the bottom half, Schumaker singled home a run and Juan Uribe hit a sacrifice fly to extend the Dodgers' lead to 5-0. The Dodgers tacked on two more runs in the seventh against A.J. Ramos with Uribe's RBI single and a passed ball by Olivo that let Ethier score.	Game notes	Ethier, a 2011 Gold Glove winner in right field, robbed Diaz of extra bases in the eighth with a diving catch in the alley. ... Olivo has three home runs in his last four games against the Dodgers. ... Kemp is two hits shy of 1,000.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

DETROIT --  Terry Francona's Cleveland Indians passed their first test against the defending American League champions.	They beat Justin Verlander on Saturday night and rallied against Jose Valverde on Sunday. When it was over, Cleveland had taken two of three from the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park.	Pinch-hitter Mark Reynolds had a tiebreaking single in the 10th inning to give the Indians a 4-3 victory in the series finale. Cleveland tied the game with a run off Valverde in the ninth.	"That was as good a team effort as you are ever going to see," said Francona, who took over as Cleveland's manager before this season. "We left some guys on base early, and that's tough against any team, much less that one. But we kept playing and we got it in the end."	Cleveland tied it in the ninth when Michael Brantley hit a two-out RBI single off Valverde. Joe Smith (1-0) pitched the bottom of the inning, and the Indians took the lead in the 10th.	With men on first and third and one out in the 10th, Michael Bourn hit a slow grounder to shortstop Jhonny Peralta, who threw home in time to get Asdrubal Cabrera. Reynolds followed with a single to left off Darin Downs (0-1) that slipped past third baseman Miguel Cabrera's diving attempt.	"With two strikes, I'm just trying to shorten up my swing and get something into play," Reynolds said. "He threw me a changeup, and I was able to get it on the ground and past Cabrera. That felt good."	The game wasn't over yet, though. Cleveland closer Chris Perez, who retired Miguel Cabrera with the potential winning run on base Saturday night, wasn't available, so Rich Hill got the first two outs of the Detroit 10th, and Cody Allen finished for his first career save.	"He had a taxing outing 12 hours ago, so I told him I wanted him to be honest with me when he started to warm up," Francona said of Perez. "To his credit, he did just that, so I told him we'd find another way to win the game."	The Indians have won 15 of 20, and Sunday's win brought them even with the Tigers atop the AL Central.	Cleveland has not lost any of its last seven series.	The Tigers were prepared to let Valverde leave via free agency in the offseason, but they ended up bringing him back on a minor league deal. He was back in Detroit as the closer by the end of April, and he hadn't allowed a run in five appearances before Sunday.	But he walked two in the ninth before Brantley's tying single.	"You have to respect the hitter, too," Valverde said. "You have to remember, this guy is a big leaguer, too."	Detroit threatened in the bottom of the ninth when Andy Dirks led off with a single, but Torii Hunter couldn't get a bunt down and ended up hitting into a 1-6-3 double play -- Asdrubal Cabrera had to spin awkwardly near second because of Smith's slightly inaccurate throw, but he made the turn successfully.	"That's just a fantastic, athletic play," Francona said. "The throw was tailing away from him, but he caught it, managed to keep his foot on the bag and then throws Torii out with nothing but arm strength."	That meant Miguel Cabrera had to hit with the bases empty, and his flyout sent the game to extra innings.	Asdrubal Cabrera doubled leading off the 10th and went to third on Nick Swisher's tapper to the pitcher. After Carlos Santana was intentionally walked, the Tigers got a big out when Asdrubal Cabrera was thrown out at home.	But Reynolds came through for the Indians, driving home Santana from second.	Brayan Pena homered for the Tigers, and Detroit starter Rick Porcello allowed two runs and four hits in six innings. He struck out six and walked two.	Zach McAllister allowed two earned runs and eight hits in six innings for the Indians.	Pena's two-run homer in the second opened the scoring. The Indians tied it the following inning on a two-run double by Jason Kipnis.	Detroit scored an unearned run in the fourth after Cleveland third baseman Lonnie Chisenhall threw wildly to first on Peralta's grounderl for a two-base error. Pena's grounder up the middle hit second base for an infield single, and Omar Infante drove in Peralta with a sacrifice fly.	Game notes	 There was some light rain during the middle of the game on a chilly day at Comerica Park. ... Detroit OF Austin Jackson had the day off with a sore right hamstring. ... Cleveland OF Ryan Raburn started against his former team. He made a shoe-top catch in the first on a line drive by Prince Fielder and was hit by a pitch in the fourth. ... Miguel Cabrera extended his hitting streak to 11 games. ... Detroit hosts Houston on Monday night. Anibal Sanchez (3-3) starts for the Tigers against Bud Norris (4-3). The Indians play a doubleheader at home against the New York Yankees. Justin Masterson (3-3) takes the mound for Cleveland in the opener, and Trevor Bauer (1-1) will pitch the second game for the Indians.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CINCINNATI --  Don Lutz's mother didn't like the sound of his voice when he called her at home in Germany an hour before he started in left field for the Cincinnati Reds on Sunday.	"I've been sick, and she said, `What's wrong with your voice?" Lutz said. "She said, `Take your vitamins."	Lutz wasted no time proving to his mom, Marlen, that he was healthy. The rookie, who was born in the United States and grew up in Germany, hit his first career home run, a three-run drive off the right-field foul pole in the second inning that led Cincinnati over the Milwaukee Brewers 5-1 for a three-game sweep.	Lutz, who made his big league debut on April 29, homered off Wily Peralta (3-3). Pinch-hitter Xavier Paul homered in the seventh, sending Milwaukee to its fourth straight loss and ninth in 10 games.	Bronson Arroyo (3-4) ended a four-start winless streak, allowing five hits in 6 2/3 scoreless innings with one walk and five strikeouts. He had been 0-3 since beating Philadelphia on April 15, and he snapped out of the slump despite not feeling well, manager Dusty Baker said.	"I'm not sure what he had," Baker said. "Sometimes, you just don't feel right. It's not something you can name. We knew about the seventh that he was about out of gas."	Arroyo rarely feels well in day games, he said.	"I didn't have a whole lot of stuff," he said. "I was grinding from the first inning on. I knew I was getting away with pitches that I normally wouldn't. Luckily, they were beating them into the ground."	Sam LeCure struck out Jeff Bianchi looking to end the seventh, Jonathan Broxton allowed an unearned run in the eighth and Aroldis Chapman pitched the ninth.	Peralta (3-3) gave up four runs -- three earned -- on five hits and two walks in six innings.	Baker got his 1,603rd win as a manager, moving past Hall of Famer Fred Clarke into sole possession of 17th place on baseball's career list, 16 behind Ralph Houk. Baker, in his 20th season as a manager, is 1,603-1,448 (.525).	The Brewers have lost 10 of 12 against Cincinnati. The Reds have won the last four series against Milwaukee in Cincinnati and five of the last six overall.	Brandon Phillips and Jay Bruce opened the second inning with singles and, one out later, Lutz lined a 1-0 pitch off the foul pole. He is 6 for 13 during a six-game hitting streak.	"It was awesome," Lutz said. "My mom and grandma were watching (on television). I'm sure they were pretty excited."	He hadn't promised to hit a home run during his pregame Mother's Day phone call.	"I didn't want to get ahead of myself," Lutz said.	Peralta had no problem with the pitch.	"I made a great pitch," he said. "There's nothing I could do. If I had to put it right there again, I would. I don't think he'd hit it."	Cincinnati scored an unearned run in the third. After a throwing error by Peralta on a comebacker, Bruce hit a potential inning-ending, double-play grounder, but shortstop Jean Segura's relay sailed over first baseman Yuniesky Betancourt for another error.	The Brewers have been their own worst enemies, according to manager Ron Roenicke.	"We haven't played well," he said. "We can't do the little things against good teams."	Paul led off the seventh with his second homer of the season, a 404-foot drive into the right-field seats on an 0-2 pitch from Mike Fiers, recalled from the minors Saturday and making his first big league appearance since April 16. Paul has four career pinch-hit homers, including two this season.	Alex Gonzalez scored on Ryan Hanigan's passed ball in the eighth.	Game notes	 Reds RHP Johnny Cueto is scheduled to make his second injury rehabilitation start Tuesday for Class-A Dayton. Cueto has been on the DL since April 15 with a strained muscle in his upper right arm. LHP Manny Parra, on the disabled list since April 26 with a strained left pectoral muscle, and OF Chris Heisey, out since April 29 with strained right hamstring, both are due to start rehab assignments on Monday with Double-A Pensacola. ... The Reds are off Monday before opening a nine-game trip Tuesday at Miami. ... Milwaukee's 10-game trip resumes Monday with the opener of a four-game series in Pittsburgh.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

NEW YORK --  Reliever Mark Melancon said his heart sunk. Second baseman Brandon Inge figured, that's it, two runs. Pedro Alvarez watched from third base and tossed his head back, disappointed.	Still, Inge tracked Lucas Duda's scorching grounder up the first-base line and Melancon broke for the bag.	Good thing, too. The baseball struck first base and shot straight up in the air, maybe 20 feet.	With Duda lumbering down the line, Inge ranged behind first and took a small hop to catch the ball. He then whipped a throw to Melancon for the final out of the eighth inning, possibly saving two runs and helping Pittsburgh beat the New York Mets 3-2 Sunday.	"Inge stayed with the play, Melancon finished his route right to the bag, and we get the out," Pirates manager Hurdle said. "Our guys didn't quit once maybe a little adversity was thrown at them."	Alvarez hit a tiebreaking RBI single in the top of the eighth against New York's overworked bullpen. Clint Barmes homered, Garrett Jones had a sacrifice fly and Jeanmar Gomez left with a lead against young ace Matt Harvey as the Pirates finished the four-game series with their third straight win.	Mets relievers had pitched 13 innings over the previous three games, so manager Terry Collins was looking for another deep effort from Harvey in his 18th big league start following a nine-inning, one-hit gem on Tuesday. Harvey went seven, lifted for a pinch-hitter with the score 2-all.	Scott Rice (1-2) walked Pirates slugger Andrew McCutchen with one out in the eighth before Brandon Lyon walked pinch-hitter Gaby Sanchez. Lyon struck out pinch-hitter Jose Tabata, then gave way to closer Bobby Parnell.	Alvarez, who played high school ball in New York City, singled to left-center for a 3-2 lead.	"It's always good to come back home and have a good series," said Alvarez, who was 6 for 11 against the Mets to raise his average above .200 for the first time since the opening week of the season. "It's icing on the cake."	The Mets had an opportunity in the eighth against Melancon, putting runners on first and third with one out. Ike Davis struck out as David Wright swiped second -- New York's fourth stolen base of the day -- before Duda hit the wicked grounder. When Inge caught the ball, he made a strong throw to Melancon, drawing gasps from many of the 28,404 in attendance.	"I assumed the worst," Inge said. "Threw a bullet to him. At that point I figured it was a make-or-break play -- the catch was on him."	Melancon threw his arms up in the air after stepping on first, not in celebration but to show the umpires he had caught it. Melancon said the ball skipped off the heel of his glove, rolled up his arm and across his chest before grabbing it with his bare hand.	"I don't remember seeing the ball," Melancon said of Inge's throw.	Said Duda: "Anything could happen in that situation. You didn't know which way it was going to ricochet or what's going to happen. But it is what it is."	Jason Grilli had a much easier time in the ninth, finishing with a perfect inning for his 15th straight save to start the season.	Gomez gave the Pirates another solid start in place of injured James McDonald, yielding one run in five innings. He said he came out after five because of tightness in his right calf. He expects to be fine for his next start.	Unlike Gomez's previous outing, when five relievers combined to finish the victory, Pittsburgh's bullpen gave up the lead in the seventh on Mike Baxter's looping single off Justin Wilson (3-0) that tied it at 2.	The Mets finished their homestand 2-4 and were 7 for 40 with runners in scoring position -- including 1 for 7 on Sunday.	"You talk about how we're snake bit, but that's just part of the game," Collins said. "What's the next thing that's going to keep us from having a big game? But we won two games on this homestand by getting a couple of big hits.  We've just got to start hitting with guys in scoring position like we did early and we did last year in the first half."	Collins tried to jolt his lineup by restoring slumping sluggers Ike Davis and Duda back into the middle of the order, and the move paid quick dividends when Duda homered to center field. He ran around the bases in his pink spikes on Mother's Day as New York went up 1-0.	But the no-nonsense Harvey appeared out of sorts from the start -- maybe it was Buck using pink stick-ons on his fingernails rather than the usual white to make pitch signs more easily readable.	Relying more heavily on his slider and curveball than a fastball that reaches 98 mph, Harvey gave up two runs in the third, and it could've been worse if Juan Lagares hadn't made a sensational catch in center field.	After Barmes led off with his second homer of the season, Gomez hit a sinking liner and Lagares reached low to get his glove on the ball, which popped out as he stumbled forward. Lagares' momentum carried him into a dive and he made the catch -- for good -- as he fell to the turf.	Harvey then loaded the bases on two walks sandwiched around a single. Jones hit a sacrifice fly for a 2-1 lead and Jordy Mercer popped out to end the inning.	Game notes	 Pittsburgh improved to 6-13 at Citi Field since it opened in 2009. ... Pirates RHP Charlie Morton (elbow surgery) is scheduled to make a rehab start Thursday at Double-A Altoona. He is targeted to throw four innings and 65 pitches. ... Pirates RHP Jeff Karstens (shoulder inflammation) is set to make a rehab start in the Class A Florida State League on Monday. He is slated to throw 50 pitches and three innings.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

BOSTON --  Jose Bautista looks comfortable in the No. 2 slot in the Toronto Blue Jays' batting order.	Bautista hit two of Toronto's five home runs, and the Blue Jays beat the Boston Red Sox 12-4 Sunday to take two of three in the weekend series.	"You get three or four runs ahead," Bautista said, "that's when some guys come out and are able to take some big hacks and we get the types of results we got today."	Bautista batted second for the second straight day after hitting No. 3 through his first 31 games. He went 2 for 3 with a walk Sunday and is 4 for 7 with two homers and a pair of walks batting second.	Different spot. Same approach.	"Pitchers know who I am, and I know who they are, and I know how they're going to try to get me out," he said. "If they execute, they get me out, and if I execute, I'm probably going to hit a ball hard somewhere."	Bautista hit 54 homers in 2010 and 43 a year later, then dropped to 27 last season as a wrist injury caused him to miss 70 of the final 72 games. He entered Sunday's game hitting just .236 with seven home runs.	"He'll get on his rolls," Toronto manager John Gibbons said. "When it's all said and done, he's going to have a great year for us. Maybe this is the start of something? We'll find out."	Emilio Bonifacio, Edwin Encarnacion and Brett Lawrie also homered for the Blue Jays, who have won just seven of their last 20 and are last in the AL East at 15-24. They finished a 4-3 trip.	"It's a great way to bounce back because we were playing pretty bad," Bautista said. "It's good to just be playing good baseball. We're playing way better baseball than when we were struggling and that's a bright spot for sure."	Chad Jenkins (1-0) got his second major league win and first since Oct. 2, allowing two runs and seven hits in five innings-plus. It was just the fourth big league start and 14th appearance for Jenkins, who missed most of spring training and the start of the season with shoulder inflammation.	"To see the guys come out and put up that kind of run support, it really makes it easier on me, knowing I've got a little bit of wiggle room to work with," Jenkins said. "Last night we got clutch hits, and then today they were just pounding balls left and right, and that was awesome to watch."	Mike Napoli and Pedro Ciriaco homered for Boston, which has lost eight of 10 following a 20-8 start under new manager John Farrell.	"I know it's a cliche, but things are evening out," Farrell said.	Ryan Dempster (2-4) gave up six runs and seven hits -- including three homers -- in five innings, his shortest start this season. The British Columbia native had been 6-0 against Toronto and Montreal in his big league career.	Boston's Shane Victorino crashed into right-field wall in the fourth while catching Colby Rasmus' drive and fell to the ground, writhing in pain. After being attended to by team personnel, Victorino remained in the game but left after the sixth inning and was taken to a hospital for further evaluation.	"Oh man," said Toronto reliever Darren Oliver, who was in the bullpen at the time. "He hit that wall hard."	Munenori Kawasaki hit a two-run single in the second, and Bautista sent Dempster's first pitch of the third into the seats above the Green Monster in left.	"I'm sure he didn't want to throw it in that spot," Bautista said of Dempster's fastball. "He was painting away on me all game long, and that ball crept up to where I like it more -- over the heart of the plate, middle in -- and I was able to connect."	Bonifacio hit a two-run homer in the fourth for a 5-0 lead, his first home run since last July 23 for Miami.	Napoli led off the fourth with his seventh homer, and Encarnacion homered in the fifth to make it 6-1. Lawrie homered off Andrew Miller leading off the sixth and Bautista hit a two-run drive off Clayton Mortensen later in the inning for a 10-1 lead, Bautista's ninth homer this year. He has 18 career multihomer games.	"He left it up in the zone where offspeed pitches get punished," Bautista said, "and I was able to connect on that as well."	Ciriaco opened the eighth with his first home run since Aug. 26.	"I think we've got a number of guys dealing with frustration right now," Farrell said. "The key for us is maintaining our level of preparation and our work routine. Those are the two things that we can control. I know with the attitude of this group, we're going to continue to work, but we're getting tested right now. There's no question about it."	Game notes	 Red Sox DH David Ortiz had a scheduled day off after playing in 19 games since returning from an injury April 20. He is in a 1-for-17 slump after hitting .414 with four homers and 17 RBIs through his first 15 games. ... Bautista has reached safely in 18 of his last 19 games. ... Farrell said RHP Andrew Bailey, on the DL with a right biceps strain, likely will throw off a mound Tuesday and the team then will decide whether he will require a rehab stint. ... Boston C David Ross was placed on the seven-day concussion DL. The team recalled C Ryan Lavarnway from Triple-A Pawtucket. ... Ciriaco entered as a defensive replacement in the seventh, making his first big league appearance at first base.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

WASHINGTON --  Welington Castillo got his bat on the ball at precisely the right time.	Even though it was a complete accident and Castillo didn't get credit for a hit, his bat essentially won the game for the Chicago Cubs.	Alfonso Soriano scored the tiebreaking run in the ninth inning after a one-of-a-kind throw by Washington catcher Kurt Suzuki went for an error, and the Cubs rallied to beat the Nationals 2-1 Sunday.	The Cubs didn't have a baserunner through the first five innings and trailed 1-0 entering the eighth before coming back in the deciding matchup of a three-game series.	Facing Nationals closer Rafael Soriano (0-1) in the ninth, Alfonso Soriano singled and took second on a single by Julio Borbon. After Ryan Sweeney struck out, both runners took off on a double steal with Castillo at the plate.	Suzuki's throw hit Castillo's bat. The ball veered well to the left of third base and into foul ground, allowing Alfonso Soriano to scoot home.	"I was just standing there and I just feel the ball hitting my bat and the ball fly into the outfield," Castillo said.	If Castillo moved into the throw, interference would have been called.	"I didn't move. I just looked," Castillo said. "Only thing that I say when (Suzuki) said something to the umpire is, 'I didn't move.' And the umpire said, 'I see you didn't move.'"	Cubs manager Dale Sveum said, "The way you draw it up, that's the way you do it. Make the catcher get around you. Don't let him have the throwing lane."	Suzuki shrugged his shoulders afterward and said, "That's the first time I have ever done something like that, let alone saw it. It's one of those things, where a freak thing happens like that."	Alfonso Soriano concluded: "It's a huge play for us and we score a run and we don't have to hit the ball."	James Russell (1-0) worked the eighth and Kevin Gregg got three outs for his sixth save.	"A very big win for us," Alfonso Soriano said.	The Cubs won the final two games of the series, even though the Nationals started Stephen Strasburg and Gio Gonzalez.	"To come back and win both games obviously against the two best pitchers in baseball showed me a lot about these guys," Sveum said.	Ryan Zimmerman drove in the run for the Nationals, who went 1 for 9 with runners in scoring position. After missing the first two games of the series with an ingrown toenail, Washington's Bryce Harper went 0 for 2 with two walks and is mired in 4-for-35 skid.	Gonzalez retired the first 15 batters he faced, finished with seven innings of two-hit ball and left with a 1-0 lead. But the bullpen couldn't make the advantage stand up.	"I feel like we have a great bullpen," said Gonzalez, who was pulled after throwing only 86 pitches. "You turn the page, move forward and go to the next series."	Gonzalez walked one and struck out six. He was flawless until Dioner Navarro opened the sixth by beating out a grounder deep in the hole that shortstop Ian Desmond gloved before opting not to attempt a throw.	The Cubs then used a walk and a single to load the bases with two outs before Gonzalez retired Anthony Rizzo on a grounder to first base.	Gonzalez concluded his performance with a perfect seventh.	In the eighth, however, Chicago pulled even against reliever Drew Storen. Navarro drew a leadoff walk and was replaced by pinch-runner Travis Wood, who advanced on a sacrifice and scored on a two-out single by Starlin Castro.	Cubs starter Scott Feldman gave up one run, five hits and three walks in six innings.	The Nationals hit two doubles and drew two walks in the first inning, but they left the bases loaded after Zimmerman doubled in a run.	Washington also stranded a runner in scoring position in the second and third innings. By that time, Feldman's pitch count was at 61.	Game notes	 Cubs 3B Luis Valbuena, who jammed his right pinky finger Saturday, was available to pinch hit but did not play. ... The Montreal/Washington franchise missed a chance to earn its 300th win against the Cubs. The teams next meet in Chicago for a four-game series August 19-22. ... After going 3-2 on their homestand against Detroit and Chicago, the Nationals begin a West Coast trip Monday night with Jordan Zimmerman (6-1) on the mound against the Dodgers.  ... Travis Wood (3-2) will start for the Cubs on Monday night in the opener of a three-game home series against Colorado.

Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  The Tampa Bay Rays went back to an old formula that has served them well.	They got solid starting pitching, game-changing defensive plays, hits at the right time and most noticeably, shutout relief pitching from Jake McGee in the seventh inning, Joel Peralta in the eighth and Fernando Rodney in the ninth.	That was enough for a 4-2 victory over the San Diego Padres on Sunday.	"It felt like it was back to normal," said Sean Rodriguez, who delivered one of the key hits in a sixth-inning rally. "You can never lose that confidence in your bullpen. They've earned that respect from us. They're going to turn it around."	Rodriguez, Yunel Escobar and James Loney drove in late runs for the Rays, who won their fifth straight and moved above .500 for the first time since April 5.	Roberto Hernandez (2-4) pitched six innings, giving up five hits and two runs. Rodney, who pitched the ninth for his 11th save, was preceded by McGee and Peralta, who have been less than automatic in the early stages of the season.	"We've been through a bad stretch," said Peralta, "and everybody has expected us to do what we've been doing the last couple days. It feels great to go out there and win games, especially McGee because I know when he gets going, he's going to be unstoppable."	McGee came into the game with a 1-2 record and a 10.38 earned run average in 16 games.	"It's been good to go out there and have some 1-2-3 innings instead of battling through every pitch," said the left-hander.	The Rays trailed 2-1 in the sixth when Evan Longoria, who hit a winning two-run homer with two outs in the ninth Saturday night, led off with a double. Rodriguez hit a tying single off Eric Stults (3-3), moved up on a wild pitch by Brad Brach and scored on Escobar's double for a 3-2 lead.	Loney, hitting .456 in his last 24 games, connected for his third homer of the season in the eighth off Dale Thayer.	It wasn't a big offensive game for the Rays, who have scored 90 runs in their last 14 games. But with the pitching and defense back in form, it was enough.	"It's funny to be talking about the pitching in that way because we're normally about pitching and not getting enough offense," said manager Joe Maddon. "But you cannot score enough runs if you don't pitch well. The pitching is starting to look like it's supposed to and while all that's happening, let's maintain this offensive production and see where it takes us."	Yonder Alonso drove in San Diego's first run with a single in the fourth, and Alexi Amarista's second home run of the season put the Padres ahead 2-1 in the fifth.	But that was all for the Padres, who were robbed by Sam Fuld's catch crashing into the center-field wall in the first inning; by Escobar's diving stab behind second base with two men on base in the fifth; and by Matt Joyce's basket catch on the warning track in the ninth.	The Rays' bullpen has now pitched 13 2/3 straight shutout innings, including 9 2/3 against the Padres.	"We had some opportunities and couldn't get the big hit, and they did. That was the key," said Padres manager Bud Black. "They got a couple of big hits, along with the home run. We just couldn't mount any sustained offense today."	The Padres were swept despite hitting five home runs and having led in all three games.	Game notes	 RHP Burch Smith, who pitched only 1 1/3 innings for the Padres in his major league debut Saturday night, will start at home next weekend against Washington. Manager Bud Black said he plans to use "the same rotation for the foreseeable future." ... Rays CF Desmond Jennings was out of the lineup for a third straight day with a mild groin strain. Maddon said he will probably play Tuesday . . . Amarista's home run was the Padres' 19th in 14 games. They hit only 12 in their first 23.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  After enduring the embarrassment of failing to go deep in the Home Run Derby, and the near-constant jeering from fans of the Kansas City Royals, Robinson Cano finally hit one into the seats at Kauffman Stadium on Sunday.	It proved to be important, too.	The two-run shot by the Yankees second baseman gave his team the lead in the third inning, and that was just about all the offense Hiroki Kuroda needed on the mound. He pitched into the eighth inning as New York beat Kansas City 4-2 to finish off a three-game sweep.	"This ballpark is big," Cano said. "I mean, this is a tough place to hit home runs."	Cano, of course, was captain of the AL squad for last year's derby in Kansas City, and had said he would choose the Royals' Billy Butler for his team. But he went back on his word, and was booed lustily by the home crowd while failing to hit a single home run himself.	The jeers continued during the All-Star Game, and didn't let up when the Yankees returned to town for their only visit this season -- at least, until Cano finally went deep.	"He's just a really good hitter," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "That's probably the best way to say it. He's just a really good hitter."	Lest he need any advice on going deep in Kansas City, he might try asking Vernon Wells.	The Yankees outfielder homered for the second straight game on Sunday, helping to pace a New York offense that scored just enough for Kuroda (5-2) to win for the fifth time in six decisions.	He allowed only a sacrifice fly by the Royals' Alex Gordon and an RBI groundout by Alcides Escobar over 7 2/3 innings. The right-hander at one point went 15 batters without allowing a hit, and was so fired up that he argued with plate umpire Laz Diaz over a call in the eighth inning.	"I guess it was the heat of the moment," Kuroda said through a translator, without relaying exactly what he said to Diaz. "I was fired up. It's not something I would normally do."	David Robertson retired Butler to end the Royals' eighth-inning rally, and Mariano Rivera worked around a leadoff single in the ninth to remain perfect in 15 save opportunities.	Rivera has converted his last 29 chances against the Royals dating to Aug. 18, 1998, his longest active streak against any team. His only other blown save against them happened in 1996.	"It's amazing. He just continues to do it," Girardi said. "Anyone who wants to argue he's not the greatest closer of all time, I don't know who it is."	Ervin Santana (3-2) gave up Cano's two-run shot in the third inning, Wells' solo homer two pitches later and an RBI single by Wells in the fifth. He departed with one out in the sixth and with the Royals well on their way to their sixth loss in their last seven games.	"I didn't have my best stuff today, but I just tried to keep my team in the ballgame," he said. "Just a couple of pitches. That's how it is against the Yankees."	Santana, who hadn't lost since his season debut April 3 at the White Sox, began his career 5-1 against the boys in pinstripes. He's now 0-6 in his last nine starts against them.	The Royals struck first when Jarrod Dyson doubled leading off the game. He advanced to third on a bunt by Escobar and then scored on Gordon's sacrifice fly.	That was all they'd get off Kuroda until the eighth inning.	New York pulled ahead in the third when Chris Stewart singled and Cano pounded the first pitch he saw over the bullpen in right field. It was his sixth career homer off Santana, two more than the All-Star second baseman has had against any other pitcher.	It was especially gratifying given his history at the K.	Wells, who hit the go-ahead two-run homer on Saturday, followed with a solo shot, and then drove in Brett Gardner with a single down the third-base line in the fifth inning.	That was enough to ensure the Royals would be swept for the first time this season.	"I don't know the reasoning behind it," Royals manager Ned Yost said, "but you're just one hit away from opening up the flood gates. Sometimes that one hit in a crucial situation just relaxes everybody and all of a sudden you go on an offensive tear for a weak or 10 days. So we just wait for that to happen."	Game notes	 The Yankees put INF Eduardo Nunez on the 15-day DL, selected SS Alberto Gonzalez from Triple-A Scranton-Wilkes Barre and put 1B Mark Teixeira on the 60-day DL. ... Royals GM Dayton Moore and Hall of Famer George Brett honored Rivera prior to the game with a donation to the church where his wife, Clara, is the pastor. Rivera intends to retire after the season. ... RHP Luis Mendoza will start Monday for the Royals at the Angels. The Yankees head to Cleveland for a doubleheader with RHP David Phelps on the mound in Game 1 and LHP Vidal Nuno starting Game 2.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Wei-Yin Chen was on his way to pitching another strong game Sunday, then he felt some pain.	His Baltimore teammates made sure the abbreviated effort did not go to waste.	Chris Davis, Adam Jones and Steve Pearce homered and the Orioles defeated the Minnesota Twins 6-0.	Chen pitched five strong innings before leaving with a right oblique strain, and the Orioles won for the sixth time in eight games.	"In the fifth inning after the last batter, after two strikes, I just had a weird feeling and I just tried to be strong and finish out the inning," Chen said through a translator.	Chen (3-3) was breezing through the Twins lineup, allowing no runs and five hits while striking out three in five innings. He has allowed no more than three runs in seven of his eight starts this year.	Manager Buck Showalter indicated the left-hander would be re-evaluated Monday.	"It could be a cramp, it could be something else. We'll take a look and see where we're at," he said. "I'm going to think good things."	Tommy Hunter, Darren O'Day, Brian Matusz and Pedro Strop combined for four innings of three-hit relief for Baltimore.	"We've been swinging the bats well the last few days, and it feels good to win a game by a pretty good margin," Davis said. "It takes a little bit of pressure off the bullpen and really lets us enjoy the win."	Looking for his fifth straight quality start, Scott Diamond (3-3) struggled all day. In 5 2/3 innings, he allowed nine hits and tied a career high by giving up six earned runs. He walked three after allowing that many free passes in his previous five starts combined.	"I definitely left a lot of balls up in the zone today and paid for it," he said. "I was struggling to get a grip on the ball a little bit and it seemed like I was pushing a lot of pitches rather than trying to stay on top of them. I tried to make an adjustment as the game went on and really just continued to struggle."	Nick Markakis and Manny Machado began the game with singles. After Jones grounded into a double play, Davis unloaded a 442-foot shot to straightaway center field. His 11th homer made it 2-0.	Chris Snyder had an RBI single in the second, but ended the inning when he was thrown out at the plate trying to score from first on a double by Markakis.	Markakis went 2 for 4 and is hitting .519 (27 for 52) against Minnesota since the start of last season. It is the highest average by any major league hitter with at least 40 plate appearances against any opponent in that span.	Markakis also had an outfield assist in the second, throwing out Justin Morneau, who tried to stretch a single into right into a double.	Jones lined a solo home run to left in the third, with the ball ricocheting off a railing just over the wall and up into the second deck.	"Right away (catcher Matt) Wieters wanted to know if he gets credit for where it landed, up top or down below," Showalter said.	Baltimore loaded the bases with one out in the fifth, but could only push across one run -- on Davis' groundout -- to make it 5-0.	Pearce hit a solo homer in the sixth.	"Scotty was basically up, couldn't get the ball down. They jumped him early in the count and never let him get into any kind of pattern, and every time he got one up they seemed to make him pay for it," Minnesota manager Ron Gardenhire said.	Four times in the first five innings, Minnesota's leadoff man singled, but the Twins failed to score. Brian Dozier was caught stealing, Morneau was thrown out by Markakis, Joe Mauer was stranded at first and Trevor Plouffe stuck at second.	"It's just one of those games. It happens. Through a 162-game season, you're going to have one of those games where you don't get runners on board and you don't score them," Plouffe said.	Game notes	 Minnesota was shut out for the second time this season. ... Baltimore recalled LHP Mike Belfiore from Triple-A Norfolk as a corresponding roster move for optioning RHP Steve Johnson to the Tides after Saturday night's game. ... The Twins have allowed 37 first-inning runs, more than double any other inning total. ... Twins SS Pedro Florimon missed his third straight game with a tight right hamstring. ... Minnesota's Pedro Hernandez (1-0) is scheduled to face Chicago's Hector Santiago (1-1) when the Twins and White Sox start a three-game series Monday in Minnesota. ... Baltimore's Chris Tillman (3-1) is scheduled to get the ball Tuesday when the Orioles welcome San Diego to Camden Yards. Andrew Cashner (2-2) is the Padres' scheduled starter.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

HOUSTON --  Texas manager Ron Washington wasn't sure what to expect from a couple of reserves he started on Sunday to give his Nelson Cruz and Ian Kinsler a day off.	The veteran manager was pleasantly surprised.	Leonys Martin and rookie Leury Garcia combined to get five hits, score six runs and drive in two as the Rangers completed a three-game sweep by romping past the Houston Astros 12-7.	Adrian Beltre's three-run homer was one of his four hits, and David Murphy and Martin also homered for Texas.	"The type of team that I have this year, guys have been getting opportunities to play a little more than I have in the past," Washington said. "So I think they're more prepared and more ready to go up there when there's opportunity for them to play and do the job."	He was particularly impressed with Garcia, who had three hits and scored four runs -- both career highs -- to become the first Texas rookie to record both since Jarrod Saltalamacchia in 2007.	"Leury Garcia was the one guy today that I didn't expect to make a whole lot of contact because he's the one guy that's in that lineup who hasn't been doing a whole lot of playing," Washington said. "He had a good game: scored four runs, got three hits, stole a bag, played good defense. That's what you like to have in extra guys."	Garcia was excited to contribute.	"It was awesome," he said. "I feel really good. I had a few days that I hadn't played but I was waiting for my time and I took advantage of it."	The Rangers set a season high for runs, and did it quickly. Martin led off the fifth with a home run and Beltre connected later in the inning for a 12-1 lead.	Beltre doubled twice and drove in four runs. He homered for the second straight day, hitting a drive that was originally called a double and changed to a homer after the umpires went to video review. Beltre connected off Edgar Gonzalez, signed by the Astros earlier in the day.	Beltre has heated up lately with 12 of his 23 RBIs coming in the last 10 games. He's raised his average from .214 to .260 in that span.	"Outstanding. Certainly what we needed," Washington said of Beltre's day. "He's been swinging the bat well and that average is climbing and RBIs are starting to pile up. He's my RBI guy, so I'm very happy."	Chris Carter hit a three-run homer for Houston, Brandon Barnes added a two-run shot and Jason Castro had a solo homer. The Astros have dropped 10 of 12.	At 10-28, the Astros are off to their worst 38-game start, according to STATS, breaking their 12-26 mark from 1967 and 1975.	Murphy's two-run homer came in a four-run third. Beltre hit an RBI double as the Rangers added three in the fourth, and Texas broke it open in the fifth.	Nick Tepesch (3-3) rebounded from two rough starts to allow four hits and one run in six innings, striking out a career-high eight.	The Rangers jumped on starter Jordan Lyles (1-1) for 11 hits and a career-high eight runs in four innings. He also balked home a run.	"I wasn't throwing the ball over the plate," he said. "I was missing by a little bit and missing by a lot, they hit me around pretty good, then I walked some guys, and they hit me around some more. The loss is definitely on my shoulders, and I've got to do a better job of competing."	Lyles was replaced by Gonzalez and he didn't fare much better, allowing six hits and four runs in four innings.	Lance Berkman extended his hitting streak at Minute Maid Park to 18 games with an RBI double in the first inning to make it 1-0.	Garcia singled to start the third, stole second base and advanced to third on an error by catcher Castro. Garcia scored on a groundout by Berkman.	Beltre doubled and scored on a one-out single by Craig Gentry in the third. Murphy then launched a 91 mph fastball into the seats in right field to extend the lead to 5-0.	Tepesch had allowed 11 runs and 14 hits in his last two games -- both losses -- but he was in control from the beginning on Sunday.	Carlos Pena singled with one out in the first inning, and the Astros didn't get another hit until Castro's homer with two outs in the fourth inning made it 8-1.	Martin opened the fifth with a towering homer to right field before back-to-back singles by Andrus and Garcia. Beltre connected on his homer and feel to his knee at the end of the swing before hustling to his feet. It was initially ruled a double, but a video review showed the ball hit on the center field wall above the yellow line and it was changed.	Castro had an RBI single in the eighth before Carter hit his team-leading ninth homer to the Crawford Boxes in left field off Derek Lowe to cut the lead to 12-5.	Barnes got Houston within 12-7 with a two-run homer in the ninth.	Game notes	Bud Norris pitches for Houston when the Astros open a three-game series at Detroit against Anibal Sanchez on Monday. ... The Rangers travel to Oakland where Texas RHP Justin Grimm opposes A.J. Griffin. ... Houston designated RHP Philip Humber for assignment on Sunday and signed Gonzalez. ... Texas LHP Martin Perez was activated from the 15-day disabled list and optioned to Double-A Frisco. He had been on the disabled list since March 31, retroactive to March 22, after breaking his left wrist. ... The Astros struck out 12 times, giving them a big league-leading total of 381.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ST. LOUIS --  Jorge De La Rosa answered a pair of pitching gems by the St. Louis Cardinals with one of his own. The Colorado Rockies' offense woke up, too.	De La Rosa held St. Louis hitless into the seventh inning and Troy Tulowitzki's three-run homer ended Colorado's scoreless streak at 28 innings, sending the Rockies to an 8-2 victory Sunday.	"I definitely think it was a big hit and it took some pressure off Jorge," Tulowitzki said. "He didn't feel like he had to be perfect, even though he was real close to being perfect."	De La Rosa did not allow a hit until David Freese's two-out single in the seventh.	"You try to stay calm," the pitcher said. "I think that helps, but I started feeling tired the last few innings. I think that's why I left a couple of pitches up and they hit (them) very good."	Mets lefty Johan Santana pitched a no-hitter against the Cardinals last year. Freese flashed back to that game, which ended when he struck out.	"You never want to lose a game. You never want to get no-hit, either," Freese said. "I remember last year it was pretty frustrating against Santana and it was creeping up on us.	"So it was nice to get it out of the way."	Charlie Blackmon added a two-run homer off Jaime Garcia (4-2) for the Rockies, who snapped a four-game skid. They finished with 11 hits after totaling three in consecutive shutout losses to rookie Shelby Miller and Adam Wainwright.	"Jaime definitely had a couple of pretty tough acts to follow," Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said. "He came out and looked pretty good at the beginning, and had a couple things happen that didn't quite go his way."	Nolan Arenado, who singled with one out in the eighth to break up Wainwright's no-hit bid Saturday, was among four Rockies with two hits apiece.	"It's too good of an offensive lineup to stay down too long," manager Walt Weiss said. "Tulo had a big home run that got us going."	The Cardinals lost for just the second time in 11 games. Pinch hitter Matt Adams' RBI single off Matt Belisle in a two-run ninth ended Colorado's shutout bid.	De La Rosa (4-3) struck out seven and allowed two hits in seven innings, baffling the Cardinals until Freese singled sharply to right off the glove of diving first baseman Jordan Pacheco and Jon Jay followed with a double. De La Rosa finished his longest outing of the season, and his best showing on the road by far, by getting Pete Kozma on a lineout to first.	De La Rosa entered 1-3 with a 5.13 ERA on the road and 2-0 at home with 12 scoreless innings. This was the fourth time he worked six or more scoreless innings, and he carries a 13-inning scoreless streak into his next outing.	Tulowitzki's eighth homer and first on the road since April 9 stopped the Rockies' scoreless streak two innings shy of the team record. They went 30 innings without a run from Sept. 30 to Oct. 3, 2010, according to STATS.	The Rockies entered the weekend with the top offense in the National League and still led with a .266 batting average going into the finale of the three-game series. Tulowitzki was 0 for 6 in the first two games with five strikeouts and Carlos Gonzalez had been hitless in 15 at-bats before finishing with two singles and a walk.	Blackmon batted eighth after being called up earlier in the day to replace Michael Cuddyer, placed on the 15-day disabled list with a neck injury. Blackmon got a nice ovation for his fourth career homer after mistakenly getting introduced as a player making his major league debut during his first at-bat.	"Oh my gosh," Blackmon said. "That's unbelievable. Who does that? It wasn't my first home run, but they thought it was."	Colorado had five hits in the first three innings after totaling three and going 40 consecutive at-bats without a hit the previous two days. The Rockies have never been shut out three straight times.	Garcia had won three straight starts before giving up five runs in six innings and falling to 0-3 with a 10.53 ERA against the Rockies in four starts -- his highest against any opponent. He entered as the career ERA leader at 8-year-old Busch Stadium at 2.41.	"How many starts have I made against them?" Garcia said. "You know what, I didn't even think about that at all. Obviously, they have a really good lineup but I don't think about those things."	The lefty gave up just two homers in his first seven starts and entered with a 2.25 ERA overall.	Pacheco doubled with one out in the first to stop a 34-inning drought since the team's last extra-base hit, also according to STATS. The Rockies finished with five extra-base hits, including a two-run double by pinch hitter Reid Brignac off Carlos Martinez in the eighth.	The Cardinals' streak of retiring 40 straight batters is tied for the second-longest in the majors since 1974, two shy of the record set by the Seattle Mariners from Aug. 14-17 last year, with Felix Hernandez throwing a perfect game on Aug. 15. Rangers pitchers retired 40 in a row in 1996.	Game notes	 Gonzalez had two singles and a walk and is 6 for 12 against Garcia. ... Cardinals pitchers had a 2.02 ERA the previous 10 games. ... Cardinals C Yadier Molina was 0 for 3, ending an 11-game hitting streak. He had five hits in the first two games of the series. ... Jay has a nine-game hitting streak with 14 hits.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

SAN FRANCISCO --  With all the ups and downs in recent seasons, including his demotion to the bullpen for the playoffs, Tim Lincecum can appreciate the strong starts when most everything goes right -- reminding himself, from his own experiences, how quickly things change.	Backed by solo home runs from Pablo Sandoval, Brandon Belt and Marco Scutaro, Lincecum looked in his best form so far in 2013 as the San Francisco Giants beat the Atlanta Braves 5-1 on Sunday to wrap up an impressive homestand.	Lincecum (3-2) struck out seven in seven scoreless innings to end a three-start winless stretch in which he went 0-2. The two-time NL Cy Young Award winner also stopped a four-start skid against Atlanta, beating the Braves for the first time since April 11, 2010.	"I'll take it," Lincecum said. "But I'm not jumping up in the air right now. ... I'm happy about it, but it's still a work in progress. I'm still working to get better."	Belt hit a solo homer in the second, Sandoval connected in the third and Scutaro went deep leading off the fifth. Gregor Blanco had an RBI double.	Brandon Crawford added an RBI single in the fourth for the Giants, who concluded a 7-3 homestand. San Francisco won a home series against the NL East for the first time since April last year.	Sandoval's two-out drive in the third cleared the elevated right-field arcade and found the water in McCovey Cove, setting off a kayaking commotion in a frenzy to retrieve the souvenir ball.	"Any time Pablo's got a smile on his face it's hard for the whole team not to jump on that energy and feed off it," Lincecum said.	It was the 63rd splash homer by the Giants -- home run king Barry Bonds has 35 -- seventh by Kung Fu Panda and second for San Francisco this year. There have been 89 in the 14-season history of AT&T Park, including one by the Braves' Brian McCann on Friday night.	"My wife asked me to hit a home run into the water for her for Mother's Day," Braves starter Kris Medlen joked. "I must have misunderstood her, and gave up a home run that went into the water."	In just his third quality start in eight outings, Lincecum allowed a season-low two hits after being tagged for 19 over his previous two appearances. Giants closer Sergio Romo, San Francisco's fourth reliever, allowed an RBI double to pinch hitter Evan Gattis for Atlanta's lone run.	Lincecum said he chatted with the other starters after his last outing about getting back on track collectively as a rotation.	"It's just kind of one of those things, we kick each other in the (rear end)," he said after a 111-pitch performance. "It's just, here we go, this is the start of something hopefully good."	The NL West-leading Giants make a quick, two-game stop starting Tuesday in Toronto, where former San Francisco outfielder Melky Cabrera will receive his World Series ring for contributions last season before his 50-game suspension for a positive testosterone test.	San Francisco then heads to Coors Field in Denver for four games against the Rockies.	"It's not going to be easy travel for these guys," manager Bruce Bochy said. "We get into Colorado late, but that's part of the schedule."	Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez rejoined his team after two days away to attend his daughter Gigi's college graduation in Georgia. But Atlanta lost its third straight since taking the opener Thursday night -- outscored 23-4 over the final three games.	"We haven't been real fun to watch right now," Gonzalez said. "What did we score, four runs the past couple games? They have a good club and any time we made a mistake they took advantage. We didn't get much of anything going until the end when we scored a run."	The Braves continue their 10-game trip at Arizona, where left fielder Justin Upton will face his former Diamondbacks teammates.	Medlen (1-5) lost his fourth straight decision and saw his winless stretch reach six outings since his lone victory his first time out this year, April 4 against the Phillies.	The right-hander allowed five runs, three earned, walked a season-high five and struck out one in 5 1/3 innings.	Umpires went to a replay review after Scutaro's fly ball in the sixth was interfered with by a fan, preventing a possible catch by Upton. It was ruled a double, giving Scutaro six straight multihit games during his 12-game hitting streak.	Game notes	 Lincecum went seven or more innings allowing two or fewer hits for the first time since Aug. 13, 2011, at the Marlins. "It looked nasty from my perspective," Belt said. ... Bochy on all the pink bats, sleeves, cleats and wristbands for breast cancer awareness on Mother's Day: "It's a great day for all of us to have a chance to honor our mothers, and really for me to reflect back and realize how blessed I was to have such a great mother, not just in raising me but she was a big part of my baseball life, with my father being in the service," he said. His mother, Melrose, died in March 2007. ... Bochy hadn't decided on his designated hitter for the two games against the Blue Jays.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

SEATTLE --  Joe Saunders has no idea why he can't win on the road when he can't lose at home.	The Seattle pitcher won his ninth straight decision at Safeco Field, throwing 6 1/3 effective innings Sunday as the Mariners beat the Oakland Athletics 6-1.	Saunders is 3-0 with an 0.94 ERA in four home starts this year, but is 0-4 with a 12.54 ERA on the road.	"It's killing me," Saunders said. "I know I have it in me, it's just a matter of doing it on the road. Hopefully we can turn the page a little bit and get a good start on the road."	In 13 career appearances at Safeco, Saunders is 9-0 with a 1.72 ERA.	"I don't think that's going to keep up. It's kind a fluky trend here early on," Seattle manager Eric Wedge said. "He's smart, he has a good feel, his stuff's been really good. I've been impressed with his stuff, so I don't think that's going to continue."	Saunders (3-4) allowed one run and five hits, striking out six and walking three.	Kendrys Morales gave Saunders an early cushion with a three-run homer in the first inning, and the Mariners kept adding more.	Tommy Milone (3-5) lost his fifth straight start, giving up five runs, six hits and three walks in five innings. This was the first time during the skid he failed to pitch into the seventh inning, and he has a 3.62 ERA over that span.	Milone walked two in the first -- more than he had allowed in all but one of his seven previous starts this season.	"I was maybe trying to be a little too fine in the first inning," Milone said. "Just tried to paint the black and that's probably what caused me to get behind."	Defending AL West champion Oakland has lost six of seven. The A's start a series Monday at division-leading Texas.	"You go through ups and downs, but this is not very fun now," said Oakland's Brandon Moss, who struck out four times.	Morales hit his fourth home run of the season in the first, a drive into the Oakland bullpen in left field that followed Michael Saunders' leadoff single and Kyle Seager's one-out walk.	"Kendrys came up with a huge hit and kind of got the ball rolling. Three runs in the first is kind of setting us up for a big game," Michael Saunders said. "We continued to keep adding runs throughout the game, and it was a great team game today."	Josh Donaldson and Luke Montz hit consecutive doubles in the second, and the A's had runners at the corners with no outs when Nate Freiman grounded to shortstop Brendan Ryan, who threw out Montz at the plate. Saunders retired the next two batters.	"Not too many shortstops make that play," Wedge said. "His awareness out there is tremendous. It would be a tough double-play the way the ball was hit."	Joe Saunders was as surprised as anyone when Ryan threw home.	"He about took my head off," Saunders said. "It was a heads-up play, he made a great throw and great tag."	Seattle stretched its lead on Jesus Montero's run-scoring single in the fourth and Seager's sacrifice fly in the fifth. Jason Bay added his fourth home run in the seventh inning, a drive to center off Jerry Blevins.	"We're playing good baseball right now," Michael Saunders said. "We're doing all the little things right, and it's showing."	Game notes	 Oakland manager Bob Melvin said OF Coco Crisp, on the DL with a strained left hamstring, may run the bases Monday. If it goes well, a Wednesday return for Crisp is "not out of the question," Melvin said. ... Wedge batted Seager third and moved Morales and Michael Morse both down a spot in the lineup, to Nos. 4 and 5. Wedge said the moves were designed to take some pressure off Morales and Morse. "I've seen them both chasing more than they should be chasing," Wedge said.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

LOS ANGELES --  Scott Van Slyke became the fourth Dodgers player to match Matt Kemp's season total for home runs since the two-time All-Star slugger hit his first of the year April 24 in New York. That's still the only one Kemp has after 137 at-bats.	Kemp had two singles for Los Angeles on Sunday in a 5-3 victory over the Miami Marlins, giving him 1,000 career hits and extending his hitting streak to 11 games. But manager Don Mattingly insists it's only a matter of time before the homers come in bunches for Kemp, who hit a career-high 39 in 2011.	"I feel like he's still going to hit his homers," Mattingly said. "They're going to come, but when you're forcing them, they don't seem to come. That's the one thing I don't want him to do -- try to force home runs. When he's having good swings and starts to get his hits, the power is right there with it."	Dodgers starter Chris Capuano (1-2) allowed a run and five hits in 6 1/3 innings with seven strikeouts and one walk. Last Monday, in his second start of the season and first off the disabled list, the left-hander gave up six runs over four innings against Arizona and threw a mini-tantrum in the dugout after being taken out.	"It's been a bit of a nightmare the past week. It's nice to wake up from it," Capuano said. "I was trying to watch some of the good games I had last year, look at what I did to be successful and try to stick with my strengths instead of worrying about getting to the hitters' weaknesses. I think it's a good approach with any lineup, not trying to get too caught up in a hitter's weaknesses. I had a pretty good changeup working today. And with the humidity and the moisture, I had that pitch working."	Capuano started against the Marlins for the first time since last Aug. 12, when he threw eight innings of two-hit ball in a 5-0 win at Miami.	"The last time I remember him being a little more fastball-friendly, to be honest. Today he just kind of off-speeded us to death and did a good job mixing his pitches," said Marlins center fielder Justin Ruggiano, who homered off Capuano in the sixth. "We swung at a lot of pitches we shouldn't have been swinging at, so that shows you that they were pretty good off-speed pitches. But we've got to take some of the blame for that, too, because we've got to get the ball up on him."	Brandon League finished in a non-save situation, giving up a two-run double by Adeiny Hechavarria with two outs in the ninth after allowing a game-deciding home run in each of his previous two appearances.	The Dodgers, who ended an eight-game slide Saturday night with a 7-1 victory, took two of three in the series. This is the first time they've won consecutive games against the same team since April 10-11 at San Diego. Los Angeles remains last in the NL West with a 15-21 record and trails division-leading San Francisco by seven games.	"Well, that's two," Mattingly said. "Once you've lost eight in a row, it doesn't sound like much to win a series. But it's a start. That's the way it feels."	Van Slyke, recalled from Triple-A on Friday, opened the scoring against rookie Tom Koehler (0-1) with his third big league homer leading off the second.	"That home run was off a guy I'd actually faced a lot the last two to three years (in the minors)," Koehler said. "He kind of sped up his bat with a cutter right there and he did a good job of staying on it. But the first run's not the one that kills you, so the key there is basically making sure that's the only one. And that team, with all the veterans they have, if you let them start building momentum, they can put up a crooked number real quick."	Koehler threw 79 pitches over five innings in his second big league start and first this season, allowing two runs and seven hits. The 26-year-old right-hander was recalled from Triple-A New Orleans on April 19 and made six relief appearances before replacing a struggling Wade LeBlanc in the rotation.	Koehler faced a lineup loaded with left-handed hitters except for Kemp, Van Slyke and Tim Federowicz, who were a combined 4 for 7 against him. During his stint in the bullpen, righties were 1 for 23.	"I don't feel much different than if I would have been starting consistently. So I guess that's a good sign, and now I can build off it," Koehler said.	After Nick Punto's sacrifice fly gave Los Angeles a 2-0 lead in the fourth, Ruggiano got the Marlins on the board in the sixth with his seventh homer -- all on the road.	The Dodgers extended the margin to 5-1 during a three-run seventh, as Mike Dunn gave up RBI singles to Van Slyke and Carl Crawford and a bases-loaded sacrifice fly by Andre Ethier that followed an intentional walk to Kemp. The first two runs in the inning were charged to Jon Rauch.	Game notes	 Miami RF Marcell Ozuna turned Kemp's first-inning fly ball into a double play with a perfect, one-hop throw to third to get Crawford after he tagged up. ... Marlins reserve OF Austin Kearns, who has eight hits in 14 career at-bats against Capuano, was moved from the bereavement list to the restricted list. He will be spending more time with his mother, who had a heart attack on May 5. ... Dodgers 1B Adrian Gonzalez, who is 14 for 28 with runners in scoring position, got the day off because of persistent discomfort in his neck, which affects him in the field but not at the plate.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

PHOENIX --  After rallying to tie the game in the ninth inning, the Philadelphia Phillies had just the man they wanted up with two on in the 10th: Ryan Howard.	It didn't matter that Howard had been hitless in his previous 18 at-bats, striking out in half of those. No matter that he was facing a pitcher who hadn't given up a run all season, either.	With the game on the line, few players are better than the Phillies' bashing first baseman.	Shaking off what had been a disappointing day and series, Howard looped a two-run single to right field, lifting the Phillies to a 4-2 comeback victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Sunday.	"When he's going bad, he looks bad, but he can take one swing and get the game over," Philadelphia manager Charlie Manuel said.	Shut down by Brandon McCarthy for the first eight innings, the Phillies scored two runs in the ninth against fill-in Diamondbacks closer Heath Bell. Delmon Young drove in one with a double and Domonic Brown tied it at 2 with a single up the middle.	Justin De Fratus (1-0) got a huge out with a runner on in the bottom half, striking out Paul Goldschmidt -- who began the day second in the NL with 30 RBIs.	Jimmy Rollins then singled with one out in the 10th off Matt Reynolds (0-1), and Chase Utley followed with his fourth hit, a double to the corner in right.	Howard was hitless in four previous at-bats and came up against Reynolds, who had not allowed a run in 19 straight appearances to open the season.	Howard came through, though, just as the Phillies expected.	Swinging on an inside pitch, Howard muscled a ball to right that likely would have been caught had the Diamondbacks been in their usual shift for the slugger. Instead of sending the second baseman out to shallow right against Howard, Arizona had its infield drawn in and the ball landed safely on the outfield grass, allowing Rollins and Utley to score.	Jonathan Papelbon worked a one-hit 10th for his seventh save in as many chances and the Phillies had 15 hits -- none bigger than Howard's.	"That was big for Ryan to get a big hit like that," said Phillies starter Kyle Kendrick, who shook off a shaky first inning to give Philadelphia a chance. "I'm not saying that just because I was pitching, but it's just nice to see later in the game like that."	McCarthy had an early lead after Gerardo Parra hit his second career leadoff homer and A.J. Pollock drove in another run in the first inning off Kendrick.	Inconsistent through most of his first season with Arizona, McCarthy was sharp in his eighth start for the Diamondbacks, scattering seven singles over eight scoreless innings.	The right-hander had only thrown 88 pitches, but Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson opted to pull him for Bell, who had earned three straight saves since closer J.J. Putz went on the disabled list.	Bell blew the lead in the ninth and Reynolds was uncharacteristically shaky in the 10th, giving up four hits to see his overall scoreless outings streak end at 22 games, dating to last season.	"I guess we went the way we thought was the best way to go," Gibson said. "It didn't work out. We know now it didn't work out and even if we left him in we don't know how that would have worked out. Sometimes you make decisions and it doesn't work out. That was my decision."	McCarthy was solid in his previous outing, giving up three runs over 6 2/3 innings against the Dodgers, but didn't figure in the decision after the Diamondbacks pulled out a victory in the ninth inning.	Staked to an early 2-0 lead this time, he was sharp against Philadelphia, shaking off a pair of singles in the second inning by getting groundouts and stranding runners every time the Phillies got hits.	First baseman Eric Hinske gave McCarthy some help in the sixth with a diving stop on a hard-hit ball by Howard, and shortstop Didi Gregorius ended the seventh with a double play after coming up with a tough one-hopper.	McCarthy induced another double play after pinch-hitter Michael Young led off the eighth with a single. McCarthy pitched eight scoreless innings for the first time since Sept. 3, 2011, against Seattle.	"At 88 (pitches) I was a little tired but I felt that I was at least shoring some things up," McCarthy said. "It is an inning that I always like to go back out. The last few weeks haven't been smooth and I haven't really been a guy that you counted on. I would like to get that reputation back where it is a no-brainer and I get the ball in the ninth."	Kendrick, who has struggled against Arizona, was in trouble right away on Sunday, leaving a 1-2 pitch up in the zone that Parra hit out to right. Gregorius followed with a triple to the gap and Pollock added a run-scoring single to put Arizona up 2-0 after one inning.	Kendrick settled down after that and got some help in the third, when Brown nonchalantly reached over the wall in left to rob Eric Chavez of a homer.	Kendrick allowed two runs on six hits and struck out four in seven innings.	"I just made a couple of bad pitches, pitches that were up over the plate," he said. "The guy on the other side was pitching well, so it was good to see us go out and get that win."	Game notes	 McCarthy hasn't won since Aug. 31 against Boston while pitching for Oakland. ... Reynolds' 19 straight scoreless outings matched Joe Patterson's 2011 team record. ... Diamondbacks LHP Wade Miley, who starts Monday's series opener against Atlanta, has allowed two earned runs in 11 innings in two home starts this season. ... The Phillies have a day off before RHP Jonathan Pettibone (2-0) pitches against Cleveland LHP Scott Kazmir to open a two-game series Tuesday.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CHICAGO --  The Chicago White Sox needed a big start from ace Chris Sale, and he nearly gave them something historic.	Sale took a perfect game into the seventh inning before finishing with a one-hitter, and Chicago beat the Los Angeles Angels 3-0 on Sunday night to avoid a three-game sweep. The left-hander retired the first 19 batters he faced before Mike Trout's sharp single to center ended the perfect game bid with one out in the seventh, on his 70th pitch.	"I knew warming up in the bullpen I felt loose. My arm felt good tonight," Sale said. "Warming up in the bullpen I felt like I was creating some good stuff and just wanted to transfer that out to the field, and it ended up working out tonight."	Sale (4-2) struck out seven on just 98 pitches for his first career shutout and third win in his last four outings. The one-hitter was Chicago's first since Zach Stewart had one on Sept. 5, 2011, at Minnesota.	The White Sox had lost two straight and were on the verge of being swept by a struggling Angels team. Before Saturday's loss, manager Robin Ventura called a meeting to discuss the team's woes.	"He understands how it's been going," Ventura said of Sale. "So it's one of those you need a guy like that that can go out and put together a game like that and give you a chance."	Sale pitched the third one-hitter in three days in the majors, joining St. Louis' Shelby Miller and Boston's Jon Lester, who both had theirs on Friday night.	Alexei Ramirez's two-run two-out single in the bottom of the seventh drove in Tyler Flowers and Tyler Greene to give Sale the lead and chase Los Angeles' C.J. Wilson. Alex Rios then doubled off reliever Michael Kohn to drive in Ramirez, who had three hits and scored a run.	Sale didn't require much more support than that in a game the White Sox needed badly.	"I think he (Sale) just likes the big games," Flowers said. "I guarantee you he knows everyone was watching on ESPN and that whole thing."	Wilson (3-2) gave up three runs and six hits while striking out three and walking four in 6 2/3 innings. He lost his second straight decision after losing to Houston on Tuesday.	Wilson got no support from his offense. Other than Rios' running catch against the wall on Howie Kendrick's drive in the second, there weren't any close calls for Sale.	"It just goes back to that competitive streak in you. You want to get that guy out there," said Josh Hamilton, who was 0 for 3. "Even though he is having a phenomenal night, you want to hit it hard somewhere, or barrel it up, if they make a play, they make a play, tip your hat. He did a good job."	Except for the seventh, Wilson pitched well enough to give the Angels what would have been a welcome sweep and four-game winning streak. They had lost five of seven before the series and won the first two in Chicago but fell Sunday to 10 games behind in the AL West.	"We need to carry some of the things we did well in this series forward," manager Mike Scioscia said. "I think if there is one thing we saw in this series, is that we have the ability to pitch well and I think we have to carry that forward."	For their part, the White Sox would like to prolong what happened Sunday.	Sale was eight outs away from the White Sox's 19th no-hitter in team history and their fourth perfect game after Philip Humber (2012), Mark Buehrle (2009) and Charles Robertson (1922).	The 24-year-old said he started thinking about a perfect game or no-hitter around the fourth or the fifth, but didn't sound disappointed with the one-hitter.	"I didn't wake up this morning and say I'm going to throw a perfect game or a no-hitter," Sale said. "I come to the ballpark every day when I'm pitching and say I just want to keep my team in this game and I want to win this game."	Game notes	 Scioscia said there's no timetable for starting pitcher Tommy Hanson's return. Hanson was placed on the restricted list on Friday. ... Ventura gave DH/1B Adam Dunn "a day off." Dunn is hitting .137 overall, including .105 against left-handers. ... Angels shortstop Erick Aybar missed his third straight game with a tight right hamstring suffered Thursday against Houston. Scioscia said Aybar might be available Monday. ... White Sox LHP John Danks threw 101 pitches over six innings in a rehab start for Triple-A Charlotte. Danks will make another rehab start May 18 at Triple-A before the White Sox will determine whether to bring him back. Danks hasn't pitched this season after being placed on the disabled list last May 25. ... On Monday, the White Sox's Hector Santiago (1-1, 1.69) will face the Twins' Pedro Hernandez (1-0, 5.96) in Minneapolis, while the Angels' Joe Blanton (0-6, 5.66) is scheduled to pitch against Kansas City's Luis Mendoza (0-2, 6.38). ... Ventura became the 27th White Sox manager to win 100 games.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CLEVELAND -- The Indians handed Justin Masterson the balland he never gave it back.	Masterson pitched a four-hitter for his second shutout thisseason, leading Cleveland over the New York Yankees 1-0 in the first game of a traditional doubleheader on Monday.	Masterson (6-2) overpowered baseball's hottest team for his third career shutout. He also had one against the Chicago White Sox on April 12. The right-hander is the first Cleveland pitcher to	record two complete-game shutouts in the same season since BudBlack and Greg Swindell in 1989.	"Masty went out and did exactly what you want your ace to do," Indians manager Terry Francona said. "From the very first pitch of the game he had power, he had a breaking ball, he attacked hitters."	Jason Kipnis homered in the first inning off David Phelps (1-2) as the Indians ended the Yankees' winning streak at five. New York came in a major-league best 22-9 since April 7.	Masterson had little trouble with a New York lineup lacking injured stars Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez, Curtis Granderson and Mark Teixeira. He retired the side in order four times, struck out nine and was backed by solid and sometimes stellar defense.	Shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera took a hit away from Ichiro Suzuki in the first with a barehanded throw, and he prevented a run from scoring in the second with a diving stop behind second on Chris	Stewart's grounder.	"There was no wiggle room because we had one run," Francona said, "and he made it stand. I get a big kick out of watching him because he enjoys pitching."	Francona got Indians closer Chris Perez up in the ninth to be ready in case Masterson couldn't finish.	There was no need for the bullpen.	Masterson retired Robinson Cano and Travis Hafner before Brennan Boesch singled with two outs -- New York's only hit to reach the outfield. But Masterson fanned pinch-hitter Vernon Wells for the final out as New York fell to 7-2 in one-run games.	"We ran into a guy who was really on his game," Phelps said. "You kind of have to tip your cap to him."	Cleveland, which moved into a tie atop the AL Central by winning two of three at Detroit last weekend, has won 13 of 15 and is 16-5	since April 20.	The teams played the one-admission doubleheader because of consecutive rainouts last month. The Yankees stopped in Cleveland on their way back from Kansas City, while the Indians returned home	for one day from a trip to Detroit and Philadelphia.	The Yankees would have preferred a visit to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame than an afternoon against Masterson, who allowed two infield singles in the second and a bunt in the sixth before Boesch	finally grounded a ball into the outfield in the ninth.	Masterson has won four of his past five decisions against New York.	New York's best scoring threat came in the second when the Yankees loaded the bases on a pair of two-out infield singles sandwiched around a walk. But Masterson struck out No. 9 hitter Alberto Gonzalez.	Masterson credited his defense, and said he didn't take any extra satisfaction by beating the Yankees or posting the one-run shutout.	"It's really just being able to win the game, whether it's 1-0, 1,500 to zero, it doesn't matter," Masterson said. "Guys were making great plays, that's what pumps you up as the game goes on.	We're all in it together."	Kipnis put the Indians ahead in the first with his fifth homer, a 414-foot shot into the right-field seats. It could have been a two-run homer, but Michael Bourn was called out at second trying to steal. TV replays appeared to show Bourn got his foot in ahead of	the tag, and he and Francona argued with second-base ump Brian Knight.	All five of Kipnis' homers have come in the first inning.	Other than that, Phelps settled in and held the Indians to four hits. He was replaced in the eighth after giving up a double and walk. Boone Logan threw a wild pitch but struck out Kipnis.	NOTES: Cano came in 8 for 19 in his career against Masterson, but went 0 for 4 with a strikeout. ... The Indians optioned struggling 3B Lonnie Chisenhall to Triple-A Columbus. Chisenhall, who was given the everyday starting job in training camp, was	batting .213 with three homers and 11 RBIs. ... Indians RHP Vinnie Pestano, on the DL with right elbow tendinitis, was to throw 15 to 20 pitches off a bullpen mound.

CLEVELAND --  There wasn't enough time for the Yankees to tour the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame or do much else on their short layover before going home.	So during a quick stop in Cleveland, they went to Progressive Field and split a doubleheader that wasn't on the schedule when the season started.	Vidal Nuno pitched five innings of three-hit ball to win his first major league start and Vernon Wells and Lyle Overbay drove in two runs apiece as the Yankees beat the Indians 7-0 in Monday's second game.	After being blanked 1-0 on Justin Masterson's four-hitter -- with three infield singles -- the Yankees were held to one run in the first six innings of the second game by Trevor Bauer (1-2) before rolling to their sixth win in seven games.	Pitching in just his second game for the Yankees, Nuno walked three and struck out three before handing a 1-0 lead to his bullpen. The former Cleveland draft pick became the only left-hander other than CC Sabathia or Andy Pettitte to start for New York since 2008.	"He did an unbelievable job, considering he hasn't pitched in a while," Girardi said of Nuno, who hadn't pitched since making his big league debut on April 29. "He's very poised out there. Nothing seems to bother him. He was ahead of hitters all day."	Rookie Adam Warren finished the five-hitter for his first big league save as the Yankees improved to 23-10 since a 1-4 start.	Consecutive rainouts last month forced the teams back to Cleveland for the rare, one-admission twinbill. The Yankees detoured into Ohio on their way back from Kansas City, while the Indians returned home for one day from a trip to Detroit and Philadelphia.	Still missing some of their biggest stars, the Yankees went 6-2 on a three-city, eight-game swing through Colorado, Kansas City and Cleveland.	"This is a great road trip for us," Girardi said. "We played three teams that were playing well. Colorado was a game or two out when we played them. Kansas City was tied for first and these guys are in first. To do that, it's a really good road trip."	Held to one run and three hits through six innings, the Yankees scored six times in the seventh and handed the Indians just their third loss in 16 games.	Selected by Cleveland in the 48th round of the 2009 amateur draft, Nuno gave the Yankees everything they could have hoped for.	Girardi had wanted to limit Nuno to 75 pitches, but the 25-year-old had surpassed that when he gave up consecutive two-out singles in the fifth. However, Nuno struck out Asdrubal Cabrera with runners at first and third to end the threat and preserve his 1-0 lead.	"If I give up that run they take me out of the ballgame," Nuno said. "That was crucial. I was getting tired. I was trying to keep my poise and make pitches."	The Indians were impressed by Nuno.	"I'd never seen him before but he went out there and put it on us," said first baseman Nick Swisher, who spent the previous four seasons with New York. "He put it on us really good, so next time around we'll remember that."	Nuno's first career win was hardly guaranteed when he was replaced, but the Yankees broke it open in the seventh, highlighted by Overbay's two-run double.	"To be able to shut this team down, this team has been swinging the bats," Girardi said. "They're very balanced. They have switch-hitters, right-handers, left-handers, they have speed. It was an unbelievable job."	In the opener, Masterson (6-2) gave up four singles. The right-hander overpowered the AL East leaders for his third career shutout and second this year following a blanking of the Chicago White Sox on April 12.	Jason Kipnis homered in the first inning off David Phelps (1-2) for the Indians, who were outscored 25-7 by the Yankees in two losses last month.	In the opener, Masterson had little trouble with a New York lineup lacking injured All-Stars Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez, Curtis Granderson and Mark Teixeira. He retired the side in order four times, struck out nine and was backed by solid and sometimes stellar defense.	New York's best scoring threat came in the second inning, when the Yankees loaded the bases on a pair of two-out infield singles sandwiched around a walk from Masterson. But he struck out No. 9 hitter Alberto Gonzalez and easily handled the Yanks' makeshift lineup.	"Masty went out and did exactly what you want your ace to do," Indians manager Terry Francona said between games. "They loaded up with their lefties and, from the very first pitch of the game, he had power, he had the breaking ball, he attacked hitters."	Game notes	  Girardi hinted Granderson (broken arm) is close to returning. "I've always said when Grandy feels that he's ready, then come on," said Girardi, who planned to speak with GM Brian Cashman about the center fielder. "We want him back in our lineup. If he feels he's ready to go, he's ready to go." ... Yankees rookie INF Corban Joseph led off the seventh inning of the second game with his first career hit, a double.  ... Making his final visit to Cleveland, Yankees closer Mariano Rivera was presented with a framed gold record album from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  "It was great," Rivera said. "I appreciate that. I know it will have a special place in my house." Rivera has saved each of his last 17 chances against the Indians, dating to 2003. ... Yankees INF Kevin Youkilis (spine sprain) has resumed limited on-field work, playing catch and fielding grounders on the infield grass. ... Rodriguez, coming back from hip surgery, continued hitting drills in an indoor cage and jogged as he started his second week of workouts at the Yankees' complex in Tampa, Fla. Teixeira (right wrist) continued taking batting practice and running the bases.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

ST. LOUIS --  After finally dialing in his delivery, Lance Lynn kept the Cardinals in the game just long enough.	Lynn overcame early control woes and St. Louis used a three-run seventh inning to snap a tie and beat the New York Mets 6-3 on Monday night.	"Early on I was just missing and I got a little bit upset with myself and got a little bit out of my game," Lynn said. "I was able to stay in and give my team a chance to win, that's what it's all about."	Lynn (6-1) allowed three runs on three hits and four walks the first two innings, and manager Mike Matheny said he was often missing to the third-base side of the plate. He only gave up one hit and one walk in his last five innings. He is 4-0 at home this season. It was the Cardinals' 10th win in the past 12 games.	"That really could have gone bad early on, but he fought his way through it," Matheny said. "He's a horse."	Rick Ankiel, signed by the Mets earlier in the day after clearing waivers and playing against the team that revived his career as a position player, just missed a diving catch on Ty Wigginton's pinch-hit bloop double to shallow center off Scott Rice (1-3) to open the seventh.	Ankiel's equipment didn't arrive and couldn't hang onto the ball using pitcher Jonathon Niese's glove.	"I do think if I have my glove it stays in there," Ankiel said. "I'm the type of person, if I get a glove on it I feel I should have caught it.	"I didn't. It stinks."	Matt Carpenter followed Wigginton's hit with a sharp grounder off Rice's leg and the ball rolled into foul territory down the first-base line. Wigginton never stopped running and his head-first slide barely beat the tag to snap a 3-3 tie. Matt Holliday homered with one out and Yadier Molina had an RBI double with two outs, both off Scott Atchison for the three-run cushion.	On his way to third, Wigginton saw catcher John Buck chasing after the ball "and obviously home plate was going to be open. So I took a chance."	Wigginton has two consecutive hits as a pinch hitter after a 1 for 12 start. He said the decision to keep running didn't need input from third base coach Jose Oquendo.	"The play's in front of me," Wigginton said. "So I believe you're probably your best base coach. To be honest, you're just playing baseball."	Mets manager Terry Collins said Rice deflected Carpenter's grounder on purpose to keep the ball in the infield, but then joined Buck in the chase to retrieve it and then was late covering the plate.	"John was yelling 'Get the plate, get the plate," Collins said. "He was caught up in the moment."	Atchison has been pitching since last year with a torn elbow ligament, and said after the game that his fingers were numb and tingling during the outing.	"If I can't grip the baseball, then I can't make the ball do what I want," Atchison said. "I feel like I've been managing it pretty good all year. Today, for whatever reason, the tingling came back."	Daniel Murphy had three hits with a two-run double for the Mets, busting out of a 7-for-54 slump with one RBI the previous 14 games. The Mets have dropped four straight.	Lynn threw a career-high 124 pitches, topping his previous high exactly one year ago in a loss to the Braves. Three relievers worked the last two innings with Edward Mujica earning his 10th save in 10 chances.	Lynn threw 54 pitches and Mets starter Jeremy Hefner needed 46 the first two innings in a game tied at 3, a distinct change after three straight days of pitching brilliance. Colorado's Jorge De La Rosa carried a no-hitter into the seventh Sunday, the Cardinals' Adam Wainwright went 7 2/3 innings before his no-hit bid ended Saturday and St. Louis rookie Shelby Miller retired the final 27 hitters after allowing a leadoff hit on Friday.	Three of the first four batters reached against Hefner including Allen Craig's RBI double just inside the third-base line for the lead and Jon Jay added a bases-loaded sacrifice fly that barely counted when Matt Holliday sprinted home just ahead of third baseman David Wright's tag on Craig, attempting to advance on left fielder Lucas Duda's throw.	Murphy tied it in the second with a two-run double, a liner that right fielder Carlos Beltran lost running out of the shadows into a patch of sunlight in right. Murphy scored from second on an infield hit after shortstop Daniel Descalso could not handle Wright's slow roller and the ball rolled free.	Game notes	 LHP John Gast makes his major league debut for the Cardinals in place of injured Jake Westbrook on Tuesday night against Dillon Gee (2-4, 5.55). Gast was 3-1 with a 1.16 ERA at Triple-A Memphis and began the year with 32 consecutive scoreless innings. ... Chris Carpenter, all but ruled out for the season in February due to nerve issues in his shoulder, threw another bullpen session Monday and remained on track in his bid to return as a reliever, but there's no specific timetable. "When he puts his mind to something and his body cooperates, we know what kind of talent he has." ... Descalso got his third start at SS for St. Louis. ... Buck struck out three times for a total of 13 the last six games.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

PITTSBURGH --  The way the Milwaukee Brewers figure it, they were due. Then again, they always seem due when they play the Pittsburgh Pirates.	Marco Estrada allowed three hits over seven innings and the Brewers ran wild over the Pirates in a 5-1 victory on Monday to snap a four-game losing streak. Milwaukee began the night just 1-9 in May but stole a season-high six bases against Pittsburgh backup catcher Michael McKenry and took advantage of three Pirate errors.	"We needed to get back on the right track," manager Ron Roenicke said. "We got a couple breaks, a couple choppers, that went our way. So that was nice to see, but we played a good game."	Norichika Aoki went 3 for 5 with three RBIs and two stolen bases for the Brewers. Jean Segura added three hits and three stolen bases as Milwaukee at will against A.J. Burnett (3-4) and McKenry, filling in while starter Russell Martin deals with a neck problem.	"I did what I could, Mike did what he could," Burnett said. "It's not for not trying. They're going to run on everything and when you have speed most of the time it's going to play in your favor. It's my fault for not keeping them off the bases."	Burnett allowed four runs in seven innings and pushed his National League-leading strikeout total to 72, but Pittsburgh couldn't extend its winning streak to a season-high four games as the Brewers used their speed to take advantage of several rallies in which the ball barely got out of the infield.	"Sometimes you'd rather have them hit balls 800 feet," Burnett said.	Estrada (3-2) bounced back from a rough start against St. Louis by striking out five and issuing just one walk to improve to 4-0 in his career against Pittsburgh. Roenicke pushed back Estrada's next start to give him some time to work on some things. It paid off with his best performance of the season.	"You get more days to work on stuff and I think mentally it helps because you forget about whatever," Estrada said.	The Brewers needed to find ways to generate offense while playing without star Ryan Braun, given the night off as a precaution after a neck issue that bothered him earlier this season against Los Angeles flared up.	Aoki and Segura more than picked up the slack, taking the extra base whenever the opportunity presented itself.	"It's the same as every night, we just try to stay aggressive on the basepaths and if you can go for the next base, we go for it," Aoki said. "That just showed tonight."	While McKenry can be a sparkplug at times offensively, his defense remains an issue. He allowed the New York Mets to steal four bases on Sunday, and things only got worse at the start of a 10-game homestand -- all against sub-.500 teams -- the Pirates hope will allow them to make inroads on streaking St. Louis in the NL Central.	The trouble started early. Aoki doubled to lead off the game and Segura reached on an infield hit. Segura promptly dashed to second even though McKenry called a pitchout. Aoki scored when Carlos Gomez's chopper to the mound skipped of Burnett's glove and rolled away.	Burnett escaped the first by allowing just the one run, but Aoki and Segura struck again in the fifth. Logan Schafer led off with a double and moved to third on Estrada's sacrifice bunt. Aoki followed with a double then swiped third and scored on a swinging bunt by Segura.	The Pirates, meanwhile, could manage nothing against Estrada, who gave Milwaukee's beleaguered pitching staff a much-needed quality start. The Brewers have the worst ERA (4.70) in the NL, a number that took a serious uptick when Estrada was shelled in his previous start, giving up eight runs in 3 1/3 innings against the Cardinals.	There were no such issues against the Pirates. Estrada improved to 4-0 against Pittsburgh. The Pirates touched him for a run in the seventh on Pedro Alvarez's RBI-groundout but by then he was staked to a 4-1 lead thanks to a bumbling sequence in Burnett's final inning of work.	Schafer hit a dribbled to first to lead off the seventh but reached when Gaby Sanchez couldn't collect the ball and step on the bag. Schafer then moved to second when Burnett threw wildly to first trying to keep Schafer near the bag. One batter later Aoki dribbled a grounder that Burnett mishandled for his second error of the inning. Schafer scored and Milwaukee was firmly in control.	"Tonight it was a storm we didn't have answers for out there," Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said. "This has not been the norm, this has been abnormal for us. I'm going to go, take a shower, head to the house and get ready to play tomorrow."	Game notes	 Milwaukee 2B Rickie Weeks did not start for the first time this season. Manager Ron Roenicke felt Weeks could use the rest. Weeks entered the game in the ninth as a pinch hitter and struck out to drop his average to .181. ... The series continues Tuesday. Kyle Lohse (1-4, 3.53 ERA) starts for the Brewers against Pittsburgh's Jeff Locke (3-1, 2.95) ... Pirates closer Jason Grilli left the ballpark for a few hours Monday afternoon due to a personal issue but the NL leader in saves returned by the middle of the game ... Pittsburgh 2B Neil Walker went 0 for 4 in his return from the 15-day disabled list with a hand injury.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

DETROIT --  Batting leadoff because of an injury to Austin Jackson, Detroit's Andy Dirks hit a drive to center field for a double in his first at-bat.	Three innings later, the 27-year-old outfielder made an even better impression.	Dirks hit his first career grand slam, part of a six-run fourth for the Tigers in their 7-2 victory over the Houston Astros on Monday night. He was at the top of the lineup because Jackson went on the disabled list earlier in the day with a pulled left hamstring.	"I've hit leadoff in college and I've hit leadoff in the big leagues and in the minor leagues," Dirks said. "It's really nothing different. The way I approach it, I just try to get on base for the big guys."	In the fourth, Dirks came to the plate in a good RBI situation -- bases loaded and one out. He drove an 0-2 pitch to right field for his fourth homer of the year.	Houston starter Bud Norris said it was a hanging slider.	"It was the worst 0-2 pitch of my career," he lamented.	The pitch looked just fine to Dirks.	"I liked it," he said. "It's just one of those things in baseball. He didn't mean to leave a pitch over the plate like that, and I was fortunate enough to be on time with it and hit it."	Victor Martinez also homered for the Tigers, who swept four straight from the Astros in Houston earlier this month and opened this three-game series at Comerica Park with another convincing victory.	Anibal Sanchez (4-3) allowed two runs and six hits in seven innings for Detroit. He struck out eight with one walk.	"I feel good," Sanchez said. "My pitches were working good today. I just had a bad inning. That's part of the game."	Houston scored two runs off Sanchez in the third, shortly after Astros second baseman Jose Altuve left the game with a jaw injury following a collision with right fielder Jimmy Paredes on a pop-up. Norris (4-4) left with lower back spasms after allowing seven runs and nine hits in five innings.	"Altuve came out for precautionary reasons, and he's already told me that he's playing tomorrow," Houston manager Bo Porter said. "Norris wanted to stay out there, but we'll see how he feels in the next day or two. That's always the question when it comes to back injuries."	Houston has lost five straight and 15 of 18.	Detroit trailed 2-1 when Martinez hit a two-run homer in the fourth to give the Tigers the lead. They weren't done. Jhonny Peralta and Don Kelly both singled with one out, and after a walk to Omar Infante, Dirks hit his home run.	Dirks finished with three hits.	Torii Hunter's double in the first scored Dirks to give the Tigers a 1-0 lead. Altuve left the game after colliding with Paredes, but Houston scored a couple of runs in the third to take the lead. Marwin Gonzalez singled and stole second, then scored on a single by Robbie Grossman.	Ronny Cedeno, who came into the game when Altuve left, added an RBI groundout.	But Norris, who has pitched well so far amid Houston's struggles, couldn't hold onto the lead, and his start was cut short by back problems. He left the game after a conference at the mound at the start of the Detroit sixth.	Martinez's homer was his second of the year after he missed all of 2012 with a knee injury.	The Tigers have outscored Houston 44-10 in five games this year.	Game notes	 Detroit slugger Miguel Cabrera had his hitting streak snapped at 11 games. ... Tigers RHP Doug Fister (4-1) takes the mound Tuesday night against Houston RHP Lucas Harrell (3-3).	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

CHICAGO --  The Chicago Cubs started Monday by locking up one part of their future, and then pitcher Travis Wood made his case to be the next on the list.	Wood pitched seven scoreless innings and the Cubs came within two outs of their first shutout since last August in a 9-1 win over the Colorado Rockies.	Wood (4-2) allowed two hits while striking out two for his major league-leading eighth quality start. He's the first Cubs pitcher since Hippo Vaughn in 1919 to start with eight quality starts. Wood also had two hits and an RBI for Chicago, which has won three straight for the second time this season.	Earlier in the day, the Cubs gave first baseman Anthony Rizzo a 7-year, $41 million contract extension. Wood, acquired in December 2011, doesn't have an extension like that, but is showing perhaps he might deserve one.	"I would love to be here for a long time with the Cubs, but that's out of my hands and I'm not really thinking about that right now at all," Wood said. "We've got to go out and win tomorrow, and I've got four more days to get ready for my next start and hopefully we can keep going on."	Wood started last season in Triple-A and wasn't called up to the Cubs until May 6 and didn't stay with Chicago for good until May 22. Now he's leading baseball in quality starts and, to manager Dale Sveum, becoming a major part of the "core" of the team.	He continued his run against a team that began Monday hitting .277 against left-handed pitching.	"That's as good an outing ... to throttle those guys the way they hit left-handed pitching is very, very impressive," Sveum said.	The Cubs offense wasn't bad, either.	With two outs in the first, Alfonso Soriano gave the Cubs a 2-0 lead with his fourth home run. It was Soriano's 376th of his career, tying him for 69th all-time with former Red Sox and White Sox catcher Carlton Fisk.	Chicago added to its lead with three in the third on two-out RBI doubles from Wood and Starlin Castro.	Wood's RBI was his first of the season and just his third hit.	The Cubs offense had 14 hits, one short of a season high. Along with Wood, Nate Schierholtz, David DeJesus, Soriano, Castro and Castillo each had two hits.	Colorado starter Juan Nicasio (3-1) worked around a leadoff Soriano double in the third, but the five earned runs increased his ERA over the first three innings to 6.38.	"We tried to be aggressive against him," Castillo said. "Trying to get a pitch on top of home plate and trying to hit and trying to get Wood a couple runs."	Wood and the Cubs didn't need much more than that.	Josh Rutledge hit a home run off Carlos Marmol with one out in the ninth, ruining the Cubs' bid for their first shutout win since they beat Colorado on Aug. 26. The Cubs have gone 74 games between shutouts, their longest streak since going 75 in a row from May 15 until Aug. 6, 1999, according to STATS.	The Rockies have lost five of six and have scored 12 runs over those games. They were shut out twice over the weekend by St. Louis before scoring eight runs Sunday.	"We need to be more consistent. We've struggled, there's no question, lately offensively," Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. "It looked like yesterday we busted out, but we need to be a little more consistent and put together some offense on a daily basis."	Nicasio recovered from a shaky first two innings to last six, allowing five runs and eight hits in his first loss of the season. Nicasio, who hasn't won since beating Arizona on April 26, allowed all five runs over the first two innings but finished with four scoreless.	"When you don't have the offense and they score nine runs, you don't deserve to win," Carlos Gonzalez said. "The last series, we faced some really good pitchers and the same stories."	Wood just wants to continue his own story.	"Tomorrow's a new day. You've got to get after it and put my work in," Wood said. "If I feel like I need to work on something, work on it and take the ball that fifth day and hopefully be able to keep it going."	Game notes	 Cubs pitcher Matt Garza threw a bullpen session Monday.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Ron Gardenhire has seen center fielders like Kirby Puckett, Torii Hunter and Ben Revere make some spectacular catches during his time coaching and managing the Minnesota Twins.	After Monday night, he's adding Aaron Hicks to the list.	Hicks hit two home runs and made a leaping catch in center field to take a home run away from Adam Dunn in the Twins' 10-3 win over the Chicago White Sox.	"We've definitely had our share of great ones here and that ranks right up there," Gardenhire said. "That catch is going to rank right up there, especially the moment he caught the ball. A big moment, a big play."	Justin Morneau extended his hitting streak to nine games with three hits and four RBIs, including a bases-clearing double that capped the scoring in the eighth.	Hicks, who missed the previous two games due to a sore right elbow, led off the fourth inning with a 416-foot solo homer that bounced in front of the black batter's eye in center field and gave the Twins a 5-2 lead.	With a runner on third and the Twins holding a 5-3 lead in the sixth, Dunn drove a pitch from reliever Josh Roenicke deep to center that appeared to be headed for the same spot Hicks' blast landed. However, the Twins' rookie sprinted back, leaped high, and caught the ball above the wall, falling to the ground and grinning as he opened his glove to show the ball to the umpire.	After getting congratulated by teammates jogging off the field, Hicks hit his second home run in the bottom of the sixth, this one landing in the bullpen in left-center.	"Right after the catch I felt amazing, I felt loose. To hit that one, it just capped it off," Hicks said.	Fans at Target Field stood and cheered for a curtain call, and Hicks finally obliged after Pedro Florimon popped out.	"I heard `em, but it's my first one so I don't really know," said Hicks, whose teammates doused him with Gatorade and shaving cream after the game. "Morneau's saying, `Hey these don't happen that often.' Florimon ended up popping out, so I had to kind of wait. Then I went out and got it."	Dunn and Hicks entered the game tied for the lowest batting average in baseball (.137) among qualifiers. When the night was over, Hicks' average was .152 and Dunn's .133.	"Yeah, the kid made a great play," said White Sox manager Robin Ventura, whose team allowed three unearned runs. "I think that one was one he hit well, but you don't get anything out of it. But again we are not helping ourselves on the other side."	Twins starter Pedro Hernandez (2-0) allowed three runs and six hits in 5 1/3 innings. The left-hander, who came to the Twins in a trade with the White Sox for Francisco Liriano, retired 14 of the next 15 batters he faced after giving up two runs in the first inning.	Alex Rios had two RBIs for the White Sox, who are last in the American League in batting average and runs scored. Alejandro De Aza and Alexei Ramirez each had three hits.	Hector Santiago (1-2) allowed six runs -- three earned -- on eight hits in 5 2/3 innings. He had only allowed one earned run in his previous two starts.	The Twins loaded the bases with nobody out and took advantage of Ramirez's error at shortstop to score four runs in the third. The inning was capped by Trevor Plouffe's two-run double.	"Yeah, it seems like every day we have one play that could change the game and it does wind up changing the game," Santiago said. "I mean that play there, if he makes that play we are out of it and we're up 2-0. You can keep the pitch count down. It was a big play in the game, and of late it's been something like that, just one play each and every game."	The White Sox loaded the bases against Jared Burton in the eighth, but pinch-hitter Conor Gillaspie grounded out to first.	Game notes	 White Sox LHP Chris Sale, who threw a one-hit shutout in Sunday's win against Los Angeles, woke up in pain with an abscessed tooth that needed to be pulled. Manager Robin Ventura said that won't affect Sale's next start, a rematch on the road against the Angels. ... White Sox LHP John Danks gave up three runs in six innings on Sunday in a rehab start for Triple-A Charlotte. Recovering from shoulder surgery last August, Danks will make at least one more start in the minors, Ventura said ... Florimon, who missed all three games of the series over the weekend against Baltimore because of a tight right hamstring, returned to the lineup. ... Kevin Correia (4-2) face Jake Peavy (4-1) on Tuesday in the second game of this three-game series.

PHOENIX --  Justin Upton put on quite a show in his return to Phoenix.	Upton snapped a 14-game homerless drought and had four hits to help the Braves snap a three-game losing streak.	"It was the Justin show," Braves third baseman Chris Johnson said with a smile.	Upton, the first overall pick by Arizona in the 2005 amateur draft, was playing his first game at Chase Field since the offseason trade that sent him and Johnson to Atlanta in a seven-player deal.	Upton received a mixed reaction throughout the night, with the cheers barely outweighing the boos when he stepped in or took the field for the first time.	"It was mixed, and that was what I expected," Upton said. "It is what it is. I tried to have fun with it. This time the fans were yelling at me instead of cheering me, but it was good."	Upton followed his brother B.J., who was hit on the left shoulder by Wade Miley (3-2) to lead off the sixth, and powered a changeup onto the porch above the center-field fence for his 13th home run and first since April 27 at Detroit. Despite the drought, he still leads the majors in homers.	Johnson hit a two-run homer to cap Atlanta's three-run fifth and Brian McCann also homered for the Braves.	"It usually works out like this," said Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez. "When guys are traded, they have a good night."	Mike Minor (5-2) allowed one run on eight hits over 6 2/3 innings.	"It wasn't really about me," Minor said. "It was about everybody else, because I didn't have my best stuff tonight."	Paul Goldschmidt hit his 10th home run for the Diamondbacks, who have lost three straight.	Miley started strong but faded in the fifth and never recorded an out in the sixth.	After Justin Upton's home run made it 5-1, Freddie Freeman doubled, Evan Gattis walked and both runners advanced on a wild pitch. McCann singled to right, scoring Freeman to make it 6-1. Johnson added a one-out double to left off reliever Josh Collmenter, driving in Gattis for a 7-1 lead.	"We've been scuffling to score some runs on this road trip, so to go and score some runs feels nice," Upton said.	Miley allowed seven runs on six hits over five innings. He walked two, hit a batter, struck out one and threw two wild pitches. Miley threw only 47 pitches in the first four innings but another 39 to the final 11 batters he faced.	"I was sort of messing up," Miley said. "Early in the game I was hitting spots and pitching down in the zone, but then, just like that, I couldn't get it down anymore. I left pitches up and they capitalized."	The seven runs allowed were the second-most of Miley's career.	"He didn't make the pitches he needed to make," said Arizona manager Kirk Gibson. "This team, you don't want to give them anything because you know they are going to hit a home run. That is what they do well. We put guys on and they hit home runs."	Goldschmidt gave the Diamondbacks a 1-0 lead in the first with a home run deep into the left-field bleachers.	Arizona had other scoring chances against Minor, but Prado was thrown out at the plate in the fourth by B.J. Upton on a Gerardo Parra single and Cody Ross was tagged out at home in the sixth on a double to left by Prado.	Diamondbacks Didi Gregorius ended the bottom of the fifth when he was caught attempting to steal second base.	Game notes	 Atlanta is 4-1 in its past five games at Chase Field. ... B.J. Upton was pulled for a pinch hitter in the top of the seventh with a left shoulder contusion and is day-to-day. ... Braves 2B Dan Uggla doubled in the eighth to end an 0-for-14 streak. ... Justin Upton has his 68 of his 121 career home runs at Chase Field. ... According to MLB.com, entering the game Miley had held hitters to a .178 batting average on his first 45 pitches, but batters had hit .353 from his 46th pitch on. ... Goldschmidt is the ninth Diamondbacks player to hit 10 home runs in fewer than 40 games and the first since Kelly Johnson (11 homers) and Mark Reynolds (10) each did so in 2010. ... Johnson snapped an 0-for-18 skid with a single in the third, the Braves' first hit. ... Atlanta OF Jason Heyward went 1-for-2 with an RBI double in the Triple-A Gwinnett Braves' 3-2 win over Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on Monday. Heyward was placed on the 15-day disabled list April 23 after an appendectomy April 22.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  So much for Billy Butler's offensive drought.	Butler broke out of a severe slump with five hits and five RBIs, and the Kansas City Royals kept Joe Blanton winless in eight starts this season with an 11-4 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Monday night.	"I knew I had been getting closer, but it's just one game," Butler said. "You've got to come out and do it consistently. Hopefully, I'm on that upward streak now."	Butler's hit total tied his career high, established on July 27, 2009, at Baltimore. The designated hitter has three games with five or more RBIs in the majors -- including a franchise record-tying seven on April 7 at Philadelphia, when he hit his first career grand slam. He began the day in a 4-for-35 rut with a .228 average and one RBI in 23 at-bats over his previous six games.	"Billy's one of the best hitters I've ever seen," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "I've seen a lot of really good hitters go into little slumps, and Billy's slumps are usually 0-for-9 or 0-for-10. But you also know that any day he's capable of breaking out and really carrying the team for a period of time. Billy's like a light switch. All of a sudden he can walk in, flip it, and there he goes."	Luis Mendoza (1-2) allowed three runs and six hits over six innings, striking out six and walking none as the Royals began a nine-game road trip following a three-game sweep by the New York Yankees.	"We needed to get a win," Yost said. "We knew the offense would click sooner or later, and it did tonight. We knew Billy had been struggling, and that it was just a matter of time before he got back on track. And he did it in a big way tonight."	Mendoza was staked to a 10-1 lead and took a three-hitter into the sixth before giving up a pair of runs. Luke Hochevar pitched three innings for his first save in seven big league seasons.	"Everybody contributed offensively. We got a bunch of hits and a bunch of runs and made it easy for Mendy," Yost said. "But Mendy was pretty darn good tonight. When he missed, he missed down. He had a good two-seamer, a good sinker and good action to his pitches. He also had a good curveball that he kept down in the zone."	Blanton (0-7) threw 99 pitches through 4 2/3 innings, giving up seven runs and 12 hits with seven strikeouts and no walks. The right-hander's ERA shot up to 6.46.	"I felt like I threw the ball good tonight and my stuff was good," Blanton said. "When they made contact they found holes, broken-bat balls fell in for singles and balls bounced their way down the lines. It was one of those weird games. There were a couple of innings where I was one pitch away from it. But they got a couple of two-out hits that cost me three or four of those runs."	It's the first time in the Angels' 53-year history that they have been on the losing end in all of a pitcher's first eight starts in a season. The last time one of their pitchers was winless in his first eight starts was 1997, when lefty Matt Perisho started eight times as a rookie and was 0-2. The Angels were 4-4 in those games.	Kansas City opened the scoring in the first when Alex Gordon singled with two outs and came all the way around on Butler's double off the right-field wall. Two innings later, Butler drove in two more with a two-out single.	"He's a good hitter," Blanton said. "I threw him a little bit of everything."	The Angels got on the board in the third with an RBI single by Chris Iannetta, who had one hit in his previous 27 at-bats. But the Royals increased the margin to 4-1 in the fourth with Jarrod Dyson's two-out RBI double and tacked on three more in the fifth with an RBI single by Lorenzo Cain and a two-run double by No. 8 hitter Salvador Perez that chased Blanton.	"Probably the biggest one was that last double," Blanton said. "I threw a cutter and left it up in the zone. Other than that, I thought my pitches were pretty crisp and had a lot of movement down in the zone. I felt like I had located, for the most part."	Even the Angels' improving bullpen couldn't contain Butler, whose two-run double highlighted a three-run sixth against rookie Michael Roth and gave the Royals a 10-1 cushion. The hit increased his RBI total to 25 and snapped a string of scoreless innings by Angels relievers.	Game notes	 Angels RF Josh Hamilton was 2-for-3, including a ground double to the left side against the shift. He left the game in the seventh inning because he was "a little lightheaded," manager Mike Scioscia said.  Butler, an All-Star for the first time last season, was moved into the cleanup spot five games ago after batting third most of the season.  Blanton struck out the side in the second, his only 1-2-3 inning. The only time this season that he has left a game with a lead was April 22 against Texas, when the bullpen blew a 6-3 advantage and he ended up with a six-inning no-decision.  Royals RF Jeff Francoeur, 3-for-24 with no RBIs in his past seven games, did not start even though he is 6-for-14 against Blanton.  Kansas City's five doubles were a season high.  The entire seven-game season series will take place this month, including a four-game set at Kansas City starting May 23.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  Sure, it's the Texas Rangers in town. The very team the Oakland Athletics rallied to beat in Game No. 162 last October for a stunning sweep to steal away the AL West crown from the two-time reigning AL champions.	The opponent hardly mattered Monday night. Oakland needed to bounce back and win.	Yoenis Cespedes and Brandon Moss hit consecutive home runs in the third inning, A.J. Griffin matched his season high with eight strikeouts and the A's beat the Rangers 5-1 to start an important stretch on the heels of a really rough one.	This marks Texas' first trip to Oakland since losing those final three games of the 2012 regular season to give away the division title to the surprising A's, whose latest victory ran their home winning streak in the rivalry to five.	"It was big. It was welcomed," said manager Bob Melvin, sporting a bright yellow Golden State Warriors T-shirt under his uniform. "It just felt like we were back in sync."	Back home, Oakland looked refreshed after losing six of seven on a 3-7 road trip through New York, Cleveland and Seattle. The A's avoided dropping a season-low two games below .500 for the first time since Game 2 on April 2.	Griffin (4-3) went seven innings and didn't walk a batter for the first time this season, earning his second victory in six outings since he won back-to-back appearances to start the year.	Mitch Moreland homered to give the Rangers the lead in the second, then Eric Sogard and John Jaso hit RBI singles for the A's in the bottom half.	Griffin faced either the minimum or one more batter in each of his final five innings, helped by a pair of double plays. He improved to 3-0 in four starts against division opponents.	"It's the best start command-wise I've had in the pros, in the major leagues," he said.	The right-hander got a scare when he ducked out of the way of Adrian Beltre's sharp single up the middle leading off the seventh, and the pitcher patted his hand on his pounding heart once back on his feet.	"He was keeping the fastball down and making good pitches," Texas' Elvis Andrus said. "There was nothing more we could do. His breaking ball is really slow and it's not that easy to adjust to so many mph lower than his fastball."	Next, Sean Doolittle came in and struck out the side in order on 12 pitches in the eighth.	Cespedes hit an 0-1 pitch just over the center-field wall above leaping Leonys Martin in the third. But the Cuban slugger came out of the game in the top of the fifth with a stomach bug.	"It came on during the game," Melvin said. "He threw up a couple times in the bathroom. They're calling it a stomach ailment, they don't think it's a stomach virus. They think he should be in good shape to play tomorrow."	The Rangers (24-14) arrived in the Bay Area having won seven of nine and began the day with the best record in the majors, but again ran into their division nemesis.	Oakland became the first team in major league history to win a division or pennant after trailing by five games with fewer than 10 to play, beating the Rangers in the regular-season finale. Oakland trailed by 13 games on June 30.	"We're not in here for any revenge," Rangers manager Ron Washington said before the game. "They beat us, we understand that, but there's nothing we can do about that. ... I'm not coming up in here thinking about what happened in the past. Learn from that, but that certainly isn't fueling us. What's fueling us is we're healthy and we're playing good baseball, that's it."	The Rangers had their four-game winning streak snapped. They haven't won five in a row since June 26-30 last year.	Texas righty Justin Grimm (2-3) lost his third straight after receiving one extra day of rest between outings. He gave way to Joseph Ortiz after plunking Daric Barton to begin the sixth. Ortiz immediately allowed Derek Norris' double.	Moss struck out on four pitches to start the second after fanning four times on 14 total pitches in a 6-1 loss at Seattle. Then, he connected for his sixth home run with a drive to nearly the same spot as Cespedes moments before. It marked the second time this season the A's hit back-to-back homers, also done by Jed Lowrie and Chris Young on April 3 against Seattle.	Moss' homer was the 7,000th in Oakland history. Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson hit the first on April 10, 1968.	Game notes	 Rangers RHP Colby Lewis, a former A's prospect who had surgery last July to repair a torn flexor tendon, was examined by team doctor Keith Meister in Texas and diagnosed with mild tendinitis in his triceps. He is scheduled to throw again this weekend in Arlington and pitch his next rehab outing for Double-A Frisco as soon as Monday. ... Oakland Gold Glove RF Josh Reddick is yet to swing a bat to test his injured right wrist, but hopes to do so soon. There is no tear, so he is encouraged he can avoid surgery, which he had on the left wrist two years ago. ... A's CF Coco Crisp (strained left hamstring) ran, hit and shagged flies. If all goes well, he will be activated from the disabled list Wednesday. Fellow OF Chris Young (strained left quadriceps) went 1-for-5 with a home run in an extended spring training game, but didn't feel that good. He is set to play again Tuesday. ... Announced attendance was just 11,030, a far cry from those lively sellouts to end last season.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BALTIMORE -- Instead of blowing a lead, the San Diego Padres erased a deficit.	What's more, the comeback came against a guy who hadn't blown a save opportunity since last July.	Chris Denorfia and Everth Cabrera hit two-out RBI singles off Jim Johnson in the ninth inning, and the Padres got a home run from Carlos Quentin in a 3-2 victory over the Baltimore Orioles on Tuesday night.	After the Orioles took a 2-1 lead in the eighth, Johnson (1-3) entered with a franchise-record streak of 35 straight converted saves. He immediately gave up two consecutive singles before getting Jedd Gyorko to hit into a 6-4-3 double play. But Denorfia followed with a single up the middle and, after Johnson hit Nick Hundley with a pitch, Cabrera singled to center for a 3-2 lead.	The win came after San Diego lost three straight in Tampa Bay, despite holding the lead in the fifth inning or later in each game.	"To get to (Johnson) is a great accomplishment for us," Padres manager Bud Black said. "Those are great on the road, they really are, to snatch one back when they took the lead."	Johnson hadn't blown a save opportunity since July 27, 2012, against Oakland. His streak of 35 broke the Orioles mark of 34, set in 1997 by Randy Myers.	"I really didn't put a whole lot of stock into it," the right-hander said. "It was just something you guys like to talk about."	He blamed his reversal of fortune on poor location.	"As soon as I got off the field I looked, and pitches were in different spots than they're normally at," Johnson said. "It's about execution. At this level the talent is too good. You have to execute and tonight I didn't and wasted a good effort from a lot of guys on this team."	Cabrera's hit was the 60,000th in Padres history.	Luke Gregerson (2-2) got the last out in the eighth and Huston Street earned his ninth save. The Padres were 0-18 when trailing after eight innings.	Street gave up a game-ending homer in the ninth against Tampa Bay on Saturday, so he was determined to make things right.	"The one in Tampa frustrated me more than any save in my life," Street said. "I took a lot of responsibility for not making those pitches. It bugged me, so tonight was one I really wanted."	He then said something that Johnson can take to heart.	"You can come back and get it done," Street said. "That's what this game is all about. It's bouncing back. It's just moving on to the next day and making the next pitch. You make the next pitch and good things will happen."	Ryan Flaherty homered for the Orioles, who fell to 18-2 when leading after eight.	With the score tied at 1 in the eighth, Flaherty drew a one-out walk from Andrew Cashner and was replaced by pinch-runner Alexi Casilla. After Cashner threw to first base several times to check the runner, Casilla took off for second. The throw from Hundley came up short and bounced into the outfield, allowing Casilla to reach third on the error.	Steve Pearce followed with a line-drive single to left to chase Cashner, who matched a career high by working 7 1/3 innings.	Orioles starter Chris Tillman allowed one run, four hits and two walks in seven innings. Although the right-hander wasn't involved in the decision, he lowered his ERA to 3.40 and remained unbeaten since April 17.	It was the first meeting between the teams since 2010 and first in Baltimore since 2002. The series is tied at 5.	Quentin led off the second inning with a drive to left to put the Padres up 1-0. San Diego then loaded the bases with two outs before Tillman struck out Cabrera.	Flaherty tied it in the third with an opposite-field fly that dropped into the front row of the left-field seats. It was only the second home run off Cashner in his five starts this season.	In the sixth, Quentin's bid for another home run was denied by center fielder Adam Jones, who made a leaping catch at the top of the 7-foot wall.	Game notes	The Orioles placed LHP Wei-Yin Chen (strained right oblique) on the 15-day disabled list and recalled RHP Alex Burnett and INF Yamaico Navarro from Triple-A Norfolk. ... The Padres have hit 20 homers in their last 15 games. ... Orioles LHP Tsuyoshi Wada, recovering from elbow ligament replacement surgery, will make his first rehabilitation start Thursday for Norfolk. ... Jason Marquis (4-2) starts for the Padres against Freddy Garcia (0-1) in the series finale Wednesday afternoon. ... Gyorko snapped an 0-for-12 slide with a second-inning single. ... Of the 47 home runs Tillman has allowed in his career, 32 have been solo shots. ... Baltimore's J.J. Hardy singled in the fifth to extend his hitting streak to 10 games.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

NEW YORK -- Once Felix Hernandez tweaked his back, the whole game took an odd twist.	Robinson Cano hit a two-run double, Lyle Overbay delivered a tiebreaking sacrifice fly and the New York Yankees rallied in the seventh inning after King Felix was forced to make an early exit, beating Seattle 4-3 Tuesday night.	"It was hard luck," Hernandez said.	The Mariners' ace was in the midst of another top outing at Yankee Stadium, outpitching CC Sabathia in the first matchup between the former Cy Young Award winners and taking a 3-0 lead into the sixth inning.	But with a runner on first and one out, Hernandez fielded a soft comebacker by Curtis Granderson in front of the mound, quickly pivoted and snapped a throw to second base for a forceout.	The swift play, however, came with a price. Hernandez twice kicked his left leg near the mound, trying to get loose, and seemed to say "ouch" a few times. Not a significant setback, yet enough to cause concern.	"He was feeling it," Mariners manager Eric Wedge said.	Wedge and a trainer visited Hernandez and left him in. Overbay followed with an RBI double that made it 3-1. After a walk and an inning-ending fly ball, Hernandez was pulled.	"I'm going to be fine," said Hernandez, adding he'd treat his back with ice. "Nothing serious."	Wedge said Hernandez, who's dealt with a stiff back this season, wanted to pitch the seventh.	"I didn't want to take any chances," Wedge said. "Under any other circumstances, I'm sending him out there. And I wanted to send him out there."	Hernandez allowed one earned run and five hits, and leads the AL with a 1.53 ERA.	"We had some chances off him, but he basically did what he usually does. He gets people out when they get on. He even gets better," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.	Sabathia, who had won his last eight starts against Seattle, struck out 10 in 6 1/3 innings while giving up 10 hits.	Raul Ibanez hit a two-run homer for Seattle in his return to Yankee Stadium. Granderson came off the disabled list and went 0 for 3 with a walk in his season debut.	Down 3-1, the Yankees rallied for three runs in the seventh to win for the seventh time in eight games.	Mariners reliever Yoervis Medina gave up a leadoff single to Chris Nelson, who went to second on a wild pitch. Charlie Furbush (0-2) entered with one out and walked Brett Gardner before Cano tied it with his double off the base of the wall in right-center.	Vernon Wells was intentionally walked, Granderson walked to load the bases and Overbay hit a sac fly to center that put the Yankees ahead.	Shawn Kelley (2-0) got two outs in the seventh. Mariano Rivera pitched the ninth to remain perfect in 16 save chances this season.	Granderson broke his right forearm in his first at-bat of spring training, and the public-address announcer said "Welcome back" when introducing the starting lineups.	Granderson was the first of the injured Yankees' stars to return to the team. Derek Jeter, Mark Teixeira and Alex Rodriguez still haven't played this year.	"It was like another opening day. Nerves coming into it since it's the first game of the 2013 season, to be here in Yankee Stadium since the first time last season, and all those different things ran through in terms of emotions and excitement," Granderson said.	Ibanez got a nice ovation before the game from fans who remembered his clutch homers last October for the Yankees -- when he connected this time, the crowd responded with a mix of boos and calls of "Ra-uuuul."	Hernandez was involved in a weird play in the fourth when he ran over to cover first base on Overbay's grounder to the right side. Hernandez was called for obstruction -- and charged with an error -- when Overbay ran into him near the bag as first baseman Kendrys Morales took the throw from second baseman Robert Andino for an apparent out.	"I was in the middle," Hernandez said.	Wedge said he argued Overbay was already out before the obstruction occurred.	On a groundball, "it doesn't matter if the runner is 89 feet away when he gets obstructed or he is 1 inch away. If he is obstructed before first base, the ball is dead and he is awarded," umpire crew chief Jerry Layne said.	Seattle took a 1-0 lead in the third on Kyle Seager's double.	The Mariners committed two errors in a game for the first time this season. C Kelly Shoppach made a wild throw to first, trying to get Nelson when he struck out and reached on a wild pitch in the third. ... DH Travis Hafner was out of the Yankees' lineup because of a sore right shoulder. Girardi said Hafner would have an MRI and get a couple days off as a precaution.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PHILADELPHIA --  With each start, Jonathan Pettibone is building a strong case to stay in the majors.	Pettibone pitched neatly into the seventh, Kevin Frandsen and Domonic Brown hit solo homers and the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Cleveland Indians 6-2 on Tuesday night.	John Mayberry Jr. had three hits and three RBIs, including a go-ahead two-run double for the Phillies, who won their third straight game to get within two games of .500.	Pettibone (3-0) allowed two runs and four hits in 6 2/3 innings, the longest of his five career starts. Three relievers got the next four outs and Jonathan Papelbon finished in a non-save situation after Philadelphia tacked on two runs in the eighth.	Pettibone, a 22-year-old righty, came up from Triple-A when John Lannan went on the disabled list. With Roy Halladay now out indefinitely, Pettibone isn't going anywhere, especially if he keeps pitching like this.	"He does a tremendous job," manager Charlie Manuel said. "He pitched a good game, kept his composure, stayed focused on what he was doing."	The Phillies improved to 12-4 when Pettibone, Kyle Kendrick or Lannan start. They're 7-16 in games started by the $64.5 million trio of Cole Hamels, Halladay and Cliff Lee.	"My first start, I didn't get any sleep the night before," said Pettibone, who lowered his ERA to 3.41. "Now I can get a full night's sleep. You just build confidence and try to build off each start."	Cleveland's Scott Kazmir (2-2) gave up four runs and six hits in five-plus innings.	The Indians had won seven of nine. They swept a two-game series at home against the Phillies two weeks ago, outscoring them 20-2.	"I thought he did a good job, unfortunately," Indians manager Terry Francona said of Pettibone. "When he needed to, he got a double play. He kept us off balance. I thought he pitched a pretty good game."	Brown got Philadelphia's rally going in the fourth by lining a one-out single. Carlos Ruiz then walked to bring up Mayberry. He ripped a two-run double to left-center to put the Phillies up 3-2.	Brown roped his seventh homer into the right-field seats to make it 4-2 in the sixth. Since Brown hit a three-run homer against the New York Mets on April 27, the team's last 16 homers have been solo shots.	"I think it's a matter of time and we can end up having a good offense," Manuel said.	Mayberry and Freddy Galvis had RBI singles in the eighth.	Frandsen hit a 1-2 pitch into the flower bed just beyond the left-field wall to give the Phillies a 1-0 lead in the first.	"They really took it to us," Frandsen said, recalling the previous interleague meeting. "They just kicked our butt. You don't want to be embarrassed and we felt we got embarrassed there. It's a big win tonight."	Nick Swisher led off the second with a single and Carlos Santana followed with an opposite-field double down the left-field line. After Mark Reynolds popped out to shallow right, Michael Brantley hit a two-run single up the middle off a 1-2 pitch.	Asdrubal Cabrera led off the eighth with a triple off Antonio Bastardo, but was stranded. Bastardo struck out Nick Swisher looking. After Santana walked, Justin De Fratus entered and retired Reynolds on an infield pop. Jeremy Horst then came in and fanned Brantley to end the inning.	Pettibone had location issues in the third when he loaded the bases on a walk and hit consecutive batters. But he retired Reynolds on a pop-up to escape the jam.	The surprising Indians, coming off a 68-94 season, are 21-17 under first-year manager Terry Francona, who managed the Phillies to four losing seasons from 1997-2000 before leading Boston to two World Series titles in 2004 and 2007.	Game notes	 Kazmir hit Frandsen twice. Frandsen, who started to give Chase Utley a day off, is 7 for 15 with two homers and four RBIs against lefties. ... The Indians are 0-4 at Citizens Bank Park. ... Cleveland's starters are 11-4 in the last 17 games. ... Philadelphia is 14-4 when scoring at least four runs. .... Hamels (1-5, 4.18) faces Cory Kluber (2-2, 5.64) Wednesday afternoon. The Phillies are 1-7 in Hamels' starts this season.	---	Follow Rob Maaddi on Twitter: https://twitter.com/RobMaaddi	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

PITTSBURGH -- Andrew McCutchen figured if he kept hitting the ball hard that something good eventually would happen.	After flying out to the warning track twice earlier in the game, McCutchen homered leading off the bottom of the 12th inning to lift the Pittsburgh Pirates to a 4-3 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers on Tuesday night.	McCutchen hit a 2-2 pitch from Mike Fiers (0-2) into the right-center field stands for his fifth home run of the season and the fourth game-ending shot of his career.	McCutchen sprinted out of the box upon contact and quickly made his way around the bases, raising his right fist in the air between first and second base.	"After the other two balls I hit, I wasn't taking anything for granted," he said. "I didn't know if it was going to go out or not when I hit it, so I just started running. Once I saw it was a home run, I just kept running."	McCutchen hit a drive to deep center field in the first inning with two runners on base that center fielder Carlos Gomez caught just in front of the fence. In the seventh, right fielder Norichika Aoki hauled in McCutchen's drive to the 375-foot sign in right-center field.	"I thought both of them were gone but I guess it's the cool weather keeping the balls in the park," McCutchen said. "It's been a cool spring and the ball doesn't seem to be carrying anywhere. Summer is just around the corner so hopefully the weather will warm up and balls will start flying pretty soon."	Pittsburgh's Jose Tabata had three hits, Russell Martin hit two doubles and Neil Walker had two hits.	Vin Mazzaro (2-0) pitched two scoreless innings to help the Pirates beat the Brewers for the just the second time in their last 12 meetings. Milwaukee had won five straight games at PNC Park.	"Everyone knows the success the Brewers have had against us, it's like they have a horseshoe (in their back pocket) every time they play us," McCutchen said. "It's awesome to be able to scratch out a win like this against them."	Ryan Braun had three hits, including a pair of doubles, for the Brewers after sitting out Monday night's win over the Pirates with stiffness in his neck and upper back. He also made a diving catch to rob John McDonald of extra bases leading off the 11th inning.	Aoki also had three hits for Milwaukee, Gomez added two hits and Jean Segura hit a home run and drove in two runs.	"It's tough to lose when you have a lead late and can't hold onto it," Brewers manager Ron Roenicke said. "We kind of let this one slip away."	Milwaukee starter Kyle Lohse did not receive a decision after losing his previous three starts. He gave up three runs, five hits and five walks in 5 2/3 innings while striking out three.	The five walks were as many as he had allowed all season coming into the game.	Lohse is 1-4 in eight starts after signing a three-year, $33-million contract late in spring training as a free agent. The Brewers have scored only 15 total runs in his eight starts.	Jeff Locke, who has won his last three decisions for the Pirates, pitched six innings and allowed three runs on seven hits with one walk and six strikeouts.	Pittsburgh had a chance to win the game in the bottom of the ninth when Tabata doubled with one out and McCutchen was intentionally walked. However, Alfredo Figardo induced Garrett Jones to ground into an inning-ending double play.	The Pirates tied the game at 3-3 in the eighth inning on Martin's run-scoring double off John Axford. Walker led off the inning with a looping single to left field and then scored all the way from first with one out when Martin doubled into the left-field corner.	"I made one mistakes and it cost me and it seems to be happening just about every time I pitch," said Axford, whose ERA is 9.20 in 18 games. "I threw the ball well. I felt really good and then it was one mistake pitch and they score a run. It's frustrating, I'm not going to lie to you."	Walker also scored in the sixth to get the Pirates within a run. He walked, moved to third on Martin's first double of the game and scored on Clint Barmes' groundout.	"It seems like every other night, somebody is coming through with a big hit late in the game," Martin said. "There's a lot of fight in this team. We never feel we're out of a game."	Game notes	Home plate umpire Fieldin Culbreth was forced to leave the game in the top of the 11th inning when he was struck in the collarbone by a foul ball off the bat of Milwaukee 1B Yuniesky Betancourt. Second base umpire Bill Welke took over behind the plate. ... Brewers 2B Rickie Weeks returned to the lineup after being limited to pinch-hitting duty Monday as manager Ron Roenicke wanted to give him a mental break. Weeks had started every game this season. ... Martin started for Pittsburgh after missing four consecutive games and six of the last seven because of a stiff neck. The Pirates were the last team in the majors that had not played an extra-inning game this season. ... Yovani Gallardo (3-2, 4.70 ERA) will pitch Wednesday night for Milwaukee against left-hander Wandy Rodriguez (3-2, 3.62).	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

TORONTO -- Melky Cabrera beat his old team with some old bats.	R.A. Dickey snapped a four-start winless streak, Cabrera had four hits against his former team and the Toronto Blue Jays beat the San Francisco Giants 10-6 on Tuesday night.	Cabrera matched a career-high by going 4-for-5 with two RBIs. He reached on an error and hit an RBI single in Toronto's six-run first, singled again in the fourth and sixth, and doubled home a run in the seventh.	"He's been on a nice little roll lately," Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. "He can hit; he's always been a good hitter. Early on he struggled, just like everybody else. Now he's starting to feel it a little bit."	Cabrera's big night came with bats he used while playing for the Giants last year, black bats stamped with an orange 53, his jersey number.	"I left some bats last season and Murph (Mike Murphy, the Giants equipment manager) sent them to me and I was using them today," Cabrera said through a translator.	Before the game, Giants manager Bruce Bochy presented Cabrera with his 2012 World Series ring in a private ceremony in the weight room.	"It was brief," Bochy said. "He was thankful and excited that he got the ring. I thanked him for his contributions, it was pretty simple. I think he was looking forward to getting it and he seemed really excited to get his ring."	The MVP of last year's All-Star game, Cabrera was suspended 50 games Aug. 15 for a positive testosterone test, and was later left off San Francisco's postseason roster. He signed a two-year $16-million deal with Toronto in November.	Edwin Encarnacion drove in two runs and scored twice as the Blue Jays had a season-high 18 hits and won three straight games for just the second time this season.	"We did a lot of good things tonight," Dickey said. "That's what we've seen more and more of over the course of the last week and a half to two weeks. I certainly think it can be a jumping off point for us."	Dickey (3-5) struck out a season-high 10 in six innings, allowing two runs and six hits, to win for the first time since April 18 against the Chicago White Sox.	"Great job," Gibbons said. "The knuckleball was alive."	Brett Cecil worked the seventh and Brad Lincoln pitched the final two innings.	Brandon Belt hit a solo homer and Pablo Sandoval added a three-run shot off Lincoln in the ninth but it wasn't enough for the NL West-leading Giants, who came in having won three straight and 10 of 13.	Barry Zito, who has won just once in six starts, allowed eight runs, five earned, and a season-high 12 hits in 5 2/3 innings. The lefty, who walked two and struck out two, fell to 1-4 with a 5.40 ERA in six career starts at Rogers Centre.	"He did a great job of putting that (first) inning behind him and pitching well," Bochy said. "He didn't cave in, he kept going."	The Blue Jays jumped on Zito (3-2) in an 11-batter first, taking advantage of two Giants errors. Cabrera reached on a throwing error by Sandoval and Jose Bautista walked before Encarnacion hit an RBI single, advancing to second when Hunter Pence threw home.	Mark DeRosa followed with a liner to center, driving in Bautista, and Encarnacion scored when outfielder Angel Pagan bobbled the ball.	"We made a lot of mistakes today," Bochy said.	Colby Rasmus, Emilio Bonifacio and Cabrera added RBI singles, giving the Blue Jays their biggest inning of the season.	The Giants got one back in the second on a two-out RBI single by Nick Noonan after back-to-back walks by Dickey.	Belt's fifth homer, a solo shot off the facing of the second deck in right in the fourth, cut it to 6-2, but the Blue Jays chased Zito and scored three more runs with a two-out rally in the sixth.	George Kontos came on after singles by Cabrera and Bautista, then gave up an RBI double to Encarnacion, an RBI single to pinch-hitter Adam Lind and an RBI double to Brett Lawrie.	Belt had an RBI double off Lincoln in the eighth, and Sandoval made it 10-6 with his seventh homer in the ninth.	Former Blue Jays infielder Marco Scutaro, who started at DH, extended his hitting streak to 13 games with a single in the third. He finished 3 for 5.	Game notes	Toronto is 12-0 when scoring five or more runs. ... Blue Jays RHP Sergio Santos will have surgery this week to remove bone spurs from his elbow. He's expected to miss six weeks. ... Toronto SS Jose Reyes (sprained left ankle) is out of his walking boot. General manager Alex Anthopoulos said Reyes could be ready to return by the end of June. ... Cabrera, who has played every game this season, will have an MRI Wednesday because of persistent pain in his legs, particularly his left hamstring. ... Bochy said C Buster Posey will start at DH Wednesday. ... Blue Jays RHP Brandon Morrow (neck) has been pushed back to Saturday, and RHP Ramon Ortiz will start against the Giants on Wednesday. ... Toronto RHP Josh Johnson (triceps) is throwing at 120 feet on flat ground is set to pitch off a mound. ... Blue Jays RHP Dustin McGowan has joined Class-A Dunedin on a rehabilitation assignment.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

DETROIT -- By the time Miguel Cabrera's homer sailed deep into the seats in left field, the Detroit Tigers were already in control -- thanks to some unexpected contributions from the bottom of their batting order.	Don Kelly and Ramon Santiago drove in a run each during a two-out rally in the fifth inning, and the Tigers went on to beat the Houston Astros 6-2 on Tuesday night. Detroit scored three runs in the fifth and two in the sixth before Cabrera gave the Tigers their final run with a solo shot in the seventh.	Kelly entered the game with one RBI, and Santiago didn't have any.	"It's good for the team," Kelly said. "All you want to do is win, and any way you can help out is big."	Doug Fister (5-1) allowed two runs and five hits in seven innings. He struck out seven without a walk.	Lucas Harrell (3-4) allowed five runs and seven hits in five-plus innings. The Astros have lost six straight and 16 of 19.	Harrell was impressive for the first four innings but couldn't hold off the Tigers, even on a night when Santiago was filling in for shortstop Jhonny Peralta and Kelly was in center field in place of injured Austin Jackson.	Kelly was hitting .200 entering the game, but his two-out RBI single in the fifth got the Tigers on the scoreboard. Santiago, who was hitting .154 coming in, drove in Kelly with a tying double.	"You don't want to be the last out. You want to keep going," Santiago said. "Those RBIs with two outs, they are big."	Andy Dirks put Detroit ahead 3-2 with a double to right-center that bounced over the tallest section of the Comerica Park wall, scoring Santiago.	"We're trying some new things with our defense, and I thought they worked against me tonight," Harrell said. "The ball that Dirks hit was up there forever, and I thought someone might have caught that one. He hit it hard, and that's my fault, but I was hoping someone would get there."	The Tigers added two more runs in the sixth on an RBI single by Victor Martinez and a wild pitch by reliever Travis Blackley that allowed Prince Fielder to score.	There was no doubt about Cabrera's eighth homer of the year. J.D. Martinez, the left fielder, stared into the crowd for several seconds in apparent disbelief after the ball cleared the fence with plenty of room to spare.	Detroit has won all six matchups with the Astros this season, by a combined 50-12. This one was more competitive than Harrell's previous start against the Tigers, which Detroit won 17-2 earlier this month.	Houston was without standout second baseman Jose Altuve, who went on the bereavement list Tuesday following the death of his grandmother.	The Astros had turned a major league-high 52 double plays entering Tuesday's game, and they added two more to that total in the first four innings. Houston took the lead in the second when J.D. Martinez hit an RBI double and Jimmy Paredes added a sacrifice fly.	But Fister retired 12 in a row after a third-inning single by Jake Elmore. He gave up a double to J.D. Martinez in the seventh but struck out the next two hitters to finish his night on a high note.	"We have spurts where we have good at-bats, but there are other times where we miss the pitch we need to hit, or when we are taking the pitches we need to attack," Astros manager Bo Porter said. "The key to making it in this league is figuring out the pitchers and how they are trying to get you out. You need to be able to adjust to the way they are attacking you, and we aren't there yet."	Game notes	Houston is 10-30, the worst start by a major league team since Kansas City was also 10-30 en route to a 100-loss season in 2006, according to STATS. ... The Tigers go for a three-game sweep Wednesday. Detroit's Max Scherzer (5-0) takes the mound against Houston's Dallas Keuchel (0-1).	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MIAMI -- One pitch from being pulled, and one strike from victory, Homer Bailey unleashed a 97 mph fastball to finish off the Marlins.	With his 125th pitch -- a career high -- Bailey completed a six-hitter and helped the Cincinnati Reds extend their winning streak to four games by beating Miami 6-2 on Tuesday night.	Bailey went to a full count on the final batter, Greg Dobbs, and wouldn't have faced another, manager Dusty Baker said.	"We were counting pitches in the ninth inning," Baker said. "We were like, 'Come on, Homer. Quit fouling them off, Dobbs.' "	Dobbs finally lined out weakly, and Bailey earned his first victory since April 5. The Reds climbed a season-best seven games above .500 as they began a nine-game trip.	The Marlins, who have the NL's worst record, lost their third game in a row and fell to 5-12 at home.	Bailey (2-3) tied a career high with 10 strikeouts and walked none in his fourth complete game. He was glad to give the Reds' relievers a break.	"They've been griping at me," he said. "The last couple of games I only went five or six. It's about time I gave them a day off."	The right-hander has endured spotty run support this season, but the Reds scored five times in the second inning to go ahead 6-1.	"With that kind of lead I was just trying to be really aggressive," Bailey said.	He retired his final eight batters and allowed only four hits over the final 8 2/3 innings.	"He worked with tremendous control," Miami's Adeiny Hechavarria said. "He located the pitches where he wanted and fooled us several times."	A brief, uncharacteristic bout of wildness proved costly for Ricky Nolasco (2-5), who gave up six runs in five innings. He hit a batter with a pitch and walked two -- both with the bases loaded.	Xavier Paul hit a three-run double for the Reds. Brandon Phillips, who began the night tied for the NL lead in RBIs, drove in two runs.	Joey Votto drove in a run and had three hits to hike his average to .322. Ryan Hanigan added two hits to raise his average to .149.	Miami batted rookies Derek Dietrich and Marcell Ozuna third and fourth, but the strategy failed to jump-start an offense ranked last in the majors in runs, batting average and homers.	The Marlins have totaled three runs in Nolasco's past three starts. Manager Mike Redmond blamed the feeble attack for Nolasco's costly bases on balls.	"It kind of stems from our offense, with him going out there he knows he can't give up much," Redmond said. "He's trying to be perfect; he ends up walking a couple of guys."	Cincinnati broke the game open in the second inning, when they scored five times with two outs. Nolasco hit Shin-Soo Choo with a pitch and, after the Reds loaded the bases, walked Votto and Phillips to force in runs.	Nolasco then grooved a 3-1 pitch to Paul, who hit a three-run double.	"One out away -- frustrating," Nolasco said. "I've been doing a good job of staying away from that big crooked inning all year but it got me today."	A five-run lead was plenty for Bailey.	"Homer to me has turned into one of those guys where you could maybe consider him the ace of your staff," Votto said. "He has consistently gotten better over his career, and it's really impressive to see him improve and grow."	Game notes	With a temperature of 77 degrees at game time, the retractable roof was open for the ninth time this season. It was open only eight times last year. ... Reds OF Chris Heisey, who is on the disabled list, aggravated a strained right hamstring Monday playing for Double-A Pensacola. His projected date to rejoin the team was pushed back to next week. ... Cincinnati LHP Manny Parra, on the DL with a strained left pectoral muscle, began a rehab assignment Monday with Pensacola and threw one scoreless inning. ... The Reds flipped RHP Mat Latos and LHP Tony Cingrani in the rotation to give the latter extra rest as he deals with shoulder soreness. Latos will now start the series finale Thursday, and Cingrani will pitch Friday in Philadelphia. ... Reds RF Jay Bruce, who had played in every game, was given the night off. ... The Marlins began the homestand averaging 18,865 fans per game, which ranked ahead of three other teams: Oakland, Tampa Bay and Cleveland.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- As good as Matt Moore has been, the Tampa Bay Rays believe he can be even better.	The 23-year-old lefty pitched six strong innings and beat the Boston Red Sox 5-3 Tuesday night to remain undefeated and claim a share of the major league lead in victories.	"It's pretty incredible," manager Joe Maddon said after Moore (7-0) yielded a double to Dustin Pedroia and a three-run homer to David Ortiz in the first, then limited the struggling Red Sox to one hit over the next five innings.	Moore, who's in his second full season in the majors, walked two and struck out eight. He also tied Washington's Jordan Zimmermann for the major league lead in victories, became the first Tampa Bay starter to begin a season 7-0 and tied a club record by winning his eighth straight decision dating to September.	"The first inning wasn't as heartbreaking as you would think it would be just because of the way we've been swinging the bats," Moore said.	"It's one of those things where you have faith in our team and what our offense is going to do," he added, "and as long as I put up zeroes and leave their lead at three, we're going to make it interesting down the road."	The Rays overcame the early deficit with a five-run fourth off John Lackey (1-4). Jose Molina and Matt Joyce each drove in two runs in the inning, helping Tampa Bay extend its winning streak to a season-high six games.	Boston has lost six of seven, including three straight. The Red Sox dropped to 4-9 in May after going a major league-best 18-8 in April.	"We've seen the past couple years when we was in a funk, it's pretty much everybody," Ortiz said. "It's like when we're playing well, everybody is performing well at the same time. Kind of strange. If you look right now, it's pretty much everybody struggling. Hopefully we bounce back and good things happen."	Relievers Jake McGee, Josh Lueke and Joel Peralta got the Rays to the ninth, and closer Fernando Rodney struck out the side to finish the combined three-hitter and earn his seventh save.	Ortiz's homer was his fifth this season and 27th of his career at Tropicana Field, the most by any opposing player. The designated hitter's 67 RBIs at the Trop are second to Manny Ramirez's 72.	Moore settled after the home run to retire 12 in a row until Stephen Drew doubled off the right field wall with one out in the fifth for Boston's third hit.	"Matt's been wonderful, and again he's going to keep getting better. There's more within Moore," Maddon said. "We've talked a little bit about the command issue, but he doesn't give up a lot of hits. He might walk a couple of guys, but they're not beating him up with hits. So there's kind of a balance there."	Lackey breezed through the first two innings before working through a tight spot in the third, when Tampa Bay loaded the bases with two outs but did not score. The Red Sox weren't as fortunate during a fourth inning in which the Rays turned five singles and Luke Scott's RBI double into five runs.	Molina's two-run single made it 3-3, and Boston first baseman Mike Napoli misjudged Joyce's infield pop fly that dropped for a two-run single and gave Moore a 5-3 lead.	"That was an odd inning to say the least," Red Sox manager John Farrell said. "Check-swing double by Scott the other way and with two outs and the tie score, a pop up that looks at the time seemingly harmless, looked like Mike just over ran it a little bit, didn't get good read on it and the ball ends up staying fair for two runs and the difference in the game."	Lackey, making his 299th career start and 300th major league appearance overall, allowed five runs and nine hits in 4 1/3 innings. He walked one and struck out three in losing his third straight decision.	Despite not having a hit after the fifth inning, the Red Sox managed to put the potential tying runs on base in the seventh when Drew and Jacoby Ellsbury before Shane Victorino lined out to end the threat.	Game notes	CF Desmond Jennings was back in Tampa Bay's lineup after sitting out three games with a sore groin. ... Boston RHP Andrew Bailey (right biceps strain) threw 25 pitches off a bullpen mound and will face hitters on Thursday. Farrell said a decision on whether the reliever will go on a short minor league rehab assignment or be activated from the 15-day disabled list will be made after Thursday's outing. ... Rays LHP David Price, who's been bothered by allergies since spring training, said part of the problem has been chemicals the team uses to wash laundry. In addition to having to deal with a rash on his neck and arms, his allergies have affected his vision at times. He was given some eye drops after undergoing a test for allergies on Tuesday. ... Victorino (ribs) said he feels physically fine and was in the starting lineup two days after crashing into the right field wall at Fenway Park. ... Boston C David Ross (concussion) will be re-examined in the next couple days.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

CHICAGO -- Carlos Gonzalez provided the Colorado Rockies with a much-needed offensive boost.	He homered twice and finished with a career-high five hits to lead the struggling Rockies to a 9-4 victory over the Chicago Cubs on Tuesday night.	Gonzalez was 5-for-5 and fell a triple shy of a cycle, and Eric Young Jr. also homered for the Rockies, who had lost five of their last six. Colorado had scored 12 runs in those games, including eight Sunday at St. Louis.	Colorado increased its lead to 5-0 in the third when Gonzalez hit his eighth of the season deep into the right-field bleachers. His home run in the ninth put the Rockies up 8-3 and gave him nine multi-home run games in his career.	He also continued to torment the Cubs, raising his lifetime average against Chicago to .427, while getting to seven home runs and 16 RBIs in 19 games.	Gonzalez became the first Rockies player to have five hits since Miguel Olivo on May 12, 2010, and his outburst was well-timed for a struggling Colorado team.	"It was a bad stretch, not being able to score runs or be able to help the team," Gonzalez said. "I think the pitchers did a tremendous job every single game but it's frustrating when you're not able to put runs on the board."	That wasn't an issue for the Rockies, whose 17 hits matched a season-high allowed by the Cubs. Troy Tulowitzki had three while Eric Young Jr., Todd Helton, Nolan Arenado had two apiece for the Rockies.	Along with Young, who hit his first home run of the season, Gonzalez paced the Rockies, who were in danger of falling to one game above .500 for the first time since April 10.	"(Gonzalez) is one of those players that's always a day away from doing something like that, or doing something you rarely see in this game," Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. "He's got that kind of ability. It was nice to see not only him, but our offense bust out tonight."	Pitcher Jeff Francis also returned to form for the Rockies.	Francis (2-3), winless since April 5, pitched six innings and gave up one run and three hits while striking out seven. After winning his first start, Francis was 0-3 with an 8.25 ERA over his next six outings.	Francis slid awkwardly into second base in the sixth, tweaking his right knee and was taken out after pitching the inning, throwing just 80 pitches.	The early exit, however, did little to diminish his night.	"It was one of those nights where you kind of feel you had it going a little bit," Francis said. "Unfortunately that happened but we've got guys down there who are capable of doing what they did."	Cubs starter Carlos Villanueva, meanwhile, did not have it going.	Villanueva (1-3) allowed six runs and 12 hits in five innings for the Cubs. He is winless since April 18 and has allowed 18 earned runs in his last four starts after giving up five in his first four.	With Matt Garza's return from the disabled list looming, Villanueva's time in the starting rotation could be short.	"We will be a stronger team when (Garza) comes back. Obviously I have my own opinions, obviously a move will be made. Tonight didn't help my cause," Villanueva said. "For me I will take the ball whenever they need me."	Cubs manager Dale Sveum wasn't really talking about any potential changes to the rotation. He said Tuesday wasn't a "tryout" for Villanueva.	Perhaps that was a good thing for the Cubs starter.	"Tonight he didn't have any one of his pitches," Sveum said.	That was apparent early, with the Rockies scoring five times in the first three innings. Young hit his home run in the second, Gonzalez got his first homer in the third, and the Rockies built their lead.	"We have a lineup that can explode at any time. We've got a lot of offensive talent and we've had to grind through this tough time the last week or so," Weiss said. "I always feel like we're capable of busting out with the group we have."	Game notes	Roy Oswalt threw 64 pitches in an extended spring training start for the Rockies. He is scheduled to pitch again Saturday, and if that start goes well he is expected to join Double-A Tulsa. ... Garza, who hasn't pitched in the majors this season after straining a lat during spring training, is expected to make a rehab start Thursday for Triple-A Iowa. Following that outing, he and the team will decide if he'll come back. Sveum didn't rule out going to a six-man rotation when Garza does come back. ... Rockies manager Walt Weiss said there hasn't been a decision made on whether Juan Nicasio will take his next start in the rotation. ... Cubs 3B Luis Valbuena was out of the lineup for the third straight day after suffering a jammed right pinky finger Saturday in Washington. Sveum said Valbuena will be in the lineup Wednesday in the finale of the three-game series. ... Wednesday's pitching matchup is Colorado's Jon Garland (3-3, 4.83) against the Cubs' Jeff Samardzija (1-5, 3.70).	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Start by quality start, Jake Peavy is putting the shoulder problems that once threatened to derail his career further and further behind him.	Adam Dunn and Dayan Viciedo hit consecutive homers to back another strong start from Peavy and lead the Chicago White Sox to a 4-2 victory over the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday night.	Peavy (5-1) gave up two runs and five hits with six strikeouts in seven innings and Tyler Flowers' double in the eighth scored the go-ahead run for the White Sox. Addison Reed picked up his 12th save.	"I think he's got a little more velocity," White Sox manager Robin Ventura said. "He's further removed from surgery. He's just stronger. He has more belief as far as in his mind he doesn't have any hesitation of letting it go. I think last year he might have held back a little bit. But this year he's pitching free."	Peavy was one of the best pitchers in the game from 2004-08, winning a Cy Young Award and pitching in two All-Star games for the San Diego Padres in that span.	But he had right shoulder surgery in 2010, and it's been a long, slow climb back. Now Peavy is 4-0 with a 2.10 ERA in his past five starts and looking more and more like the ace he was in San Diego.	"You can't say enough about the way that guy goes out there and competes and demands perfection out of himself," said Flowers, who went 2 for 4 with a double. "Our other pitchers are trying to do what he does."	Kevin Correia (4-3) gave up four runs and nine hits with two strikeouts in seven innings and Joe Mauer extended his hitting streak to 13 games for the Twins. Justin Morneau added a single and a double to increase his hitting streak to 10 games.	Dunn, who entered the game hitting a league-worst .133, and Viciedo got the Sox off to a roaring start with nearly 1,000 feet of home runs in the second inning.	One night after watching Aaron Hicks rob a home run in center field, Dunn put a little extra on a pitch that soared an estimated 413 feet into the bullpen.	Viciedo followed three pitches later with a blast that landed in the first row of the third deck in left field, some 424 feet from home plate for a 2-0 lead, but the fun was just beginning.	Proponents of expanded replay picked up some more fodder in this game and Peavy may be at the front of the line now.	The Twins caught their first break in the fifth when home plate umpire Jordan Baker missed Flowers' initial tag of Morneau at home plate. When Morneau saw that no call was made initially, he sneaked his arm into home plate and was ruled safe. Peavy and Ventura argued vehemently to no avail, and the Twins were on the board.	"He said he didn't see it," Peavy said. "I saw it pretty clearly from farther away both times. Just, you know, I understand they are going to miss some. But it cost runs, cost the tying run coming to the plate there."	First base umpire Dan Bellino missed another call in the seventh when Dunn beat Brian Dozier's throw to first by a full step but was ruled out anyway. Ventura again came out to argue briefly before heading back to the dugout.	Trevor Plouffe's single in the seventh scored Josh Willingham to tie the game 2-2, and suddenly Baker's call at home loomed very large.	"I think in the end to do all that stuff, they just want to get it right," Ventura said. "I don't know if the answer is to go more (replays), but in the end you just want it to be right."	But Peavy posted his fifth straight quality start -- he is 4-0 with a 2.10 ERA during the streak -- and Flowers and Alexei Ramirez delivered RBI hits in the eighth inning to put Chicago back on top.	The Sox were even able to overcome an error charged to Dunn at first base when a throw from Ramirez broke the webbing of his glove and popped out.	"We're getting creative; gloves breaking. So, you just scratch your head," said Ventura, who conducted a 45-minute defensive workout before the game after seeing eight errors in the past five games. "But it's a focal point. It's important and it's going to stay important. I don't know if we're going to come out here at 8:30 tomorrow, but I was thinking about it."	Game notes	 The White Sox rested struggling slugger Paul Konerko for a second consecutive day. ... Dunn and Viciedo gave the Sox their first back-to-back homers of the season. ... Twins GM Terry Ryan said RHP Cole De Vries, who has been on the disabled list all season, was scheduled to make a rehab start on Wednesday and would be evaluated after that. ... In the "great timing" department: After a month and a half of frigid temps, the Twins gave out a fleece blanket on Tuesday night. The temperature at first pitch was 92 degrees.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

ST. LOUIS -- Mike Matheny is still waiting for rookie left-hander John Gast to show some emotion.	"He's the same all the time ... he never smiles," the St. Louis manager said. "Real even keel."	Gast used that business-like approach to pick up a win in his major league debut Tuesday night.	Carlos Beltran drove in four runs and Gast threw six solid innings, helping the Cardinals cruise past the New York Mets 10-4.	Gast (1-0) tossed five shutout innings before giving up four runs in the sixth. He surrendered six hits, struck out three and walked one in a 71-pitch effort to help the Cardinals win for the fifth time in six games and 11th in their last 13.	"I was excited, ready to go," Gast said. "There was some excitement. I was able to refocus the adrenaline to make my pitches."	Matheny was pleased with the poise of the 24-year-old, who held the Mets scoreless on three hits and 50 pitches through the first five innings.	"He was fine on the corners," Matheny said. "You could tell he was working the bottom of the zone. Once he started going, he was making some really good pitches."	Beltran slammed a three-run homer in the fifth inning, his team-high tenth, to give St. Louis a 9-0 lead. He also added a run-scoring hit in the third.	"It was a fastball in the middle of the zone," Beltran said of the 437-foot blast that landed in Big Mac Land. "I was able to stay inside and hit it good."	The veteran outfielder was also impressed with Gast.	"It was fun to see," Beltran said. "That just shows the depth of our minor league system. They have a lot of guys like that who can come in and do the job."	New York right-hander Dillon Gee (2-5) gave up six runs, five earned, in four innings for the Mets, who lost their fifth straight despite scoring more than three runs for the first time in eight games.	Gee has allowed four earned runs or more in five of eight starts this season.	"I don't know what to say, I didn't feel all that bad tonight," Gee said. "I'm a ground ball guy and I think seven ground balls got through. I don't know what else to do."	Marlon Byrd hit a two-run homer in the sixth as New York also lost for the 11th time in its last 14 games at Busch Stadium.	Gast began the season with 32 consecutive scoreless innings for Triple-A Memphis. He was called up in part to fill the rotation spot of Jake Westbrook, who is on the 15-day disabled list with right elbow inflammation.	Jon Jay also homered for St. Louis, a solo shot in the sixth, his fourth of the year. Beltran went 3 for 5.	"It's fun, we're playing good baseball," Beltran said. "We're getting good starting pitching and the offense is doing enough to win ballgames."	St. Louis scored three times in both the first and third innings to take a 6-0 lead.	Allen Craig capped off the early uprising with a two-run single. Matt Holliday doubled in Matt Carpenter for the first run. The first four St. Louis hitters reached safely and the Cardinals scored three times on Gee's first 11 pitches.	Pete Kozma and Carpenter added run-scoring singles in the third. Carpenter reached safely four times.	The Mets' five-game skid is their longest since losing six in a row April 25-30.	"We've gone through a bad streak and it's been two weeks long," Mets manager Terry Collins said. "We can't sit here and try to make something positive out of it."	Former St. Louis pitcher/outfielder Rick Ankiel, who was signed by the Mets on Monday, grounded out as a pinch-hitter in the seventh. Ankiel received a warm ovation from the crowd.	Game notes	St. Louis rookie Shelby Miller (5-2, 1.88 ERA) will face Shaun Marcum (0-3, 8.59) in the third game of the four-game set tomorrow. Miller retired 27 successive batters after giving up a leadoff hit to Eric Young in a 3-0 win over Colorado on Friday. ... New York C John Buck broke out of a 2-for-27 slump with a single in the sixth. ... Ankiel is getting paid at a pro-rated share of the major league minimum $490,000 from the Mets, which comes to $382,896, and that amount is off-set against the $775,000 he was guaranteed under the deal he was released from by the Astros. He can earn an additional $775,000 in performance bonuses from the Mets based on plate appearances.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

PHOENIX --  The Arizona Diamondbacks scored their only runs with the help of an infield double.	The way Patrick Corbin pitched Tuesday night, that was all they needed.	Corbin allowed three hits in seven innings and joined Randy Johnson as the only left-handers in team history to win their first six starts, lifting the Diamondbacks to a 2-0 win over the Atlanta Braves.	"That guy is tough," Braves catcher Gerald Laird said. "It seems like he is effectively wild."	Corbin (6-0) was certainly wild at times, walking five and going into deep counts on seemingly every batter. He managed to miss in the right spots, though, and induced three double plays while striking out five in his career-best sixth straight win.	The young left-hander also helped keep Braves slugger Justin Upton in check after his impressive performance the night before and became the first Diamondbacks pitcher to start 6-0 since Brandon Webb won nine straight decisions in 2008.	Johnson won his first six starts in 2001 and went 7-0 in 2000, putting Corbin in the same company as a five-time Cy Young Award winner.	"I feel good and I just want to keep it going," Corbin said. "Anytime I can go out there and pitch like this is awesome."	David Hernandez struck out the side in the eighth and Heath Bell worked around an error in the ninth for his fifth save to help Arizona end a three-game losing streak.	Julio Teheran (2-1) matched Corbin most of the way, but crossed signals with first baseman Freddie Freeman on Gerardo Parra's infield double in the third inning. Didi Gregorius, who made some stellar plays at shortstop behind Corbin, followed with a two-run single.	That turned about to be enough against the Braves, who had four hits -- two by Reed Johnson -- and went 0 for 4 with runners in scoring position to lose for the fourth time in five games.	Atlanta was shut out by Arizona for the first time since May 16, 2009, and the first time at Chase Field since May 20, 2006.	"I thought our hitters, it was a great plan of attack against them, and hit some balls hard," Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "That is all you can do, really. We had people on base almost every inning. (Corbin) wiggled out of there in the seventh inning with some people on base. That's the nature of the game sometimes."	Corbin has been Arizona's best pitcher early this season, setting a club record by allowing two runs or fewer and lasting at least six innings in his first eight starts.	He struggled with his control a bit against the Braves, walking four -- Upton twice -- in the first four innings. He worked around the extra baserunners, though, erasing two of them with double plays	A walk in the sixth also went nowhere when first baseman Paul Goldschmidt snared Freeman's liner and stepped on the bag for another double play. Corbin also got some help from Gregorius, who made a tough play in the hole to throw out Laird by a step in the fifth.	Corbin also helped contain Upton, who made a statement in the series opener.	Back at Chase Field for the first time since being traded to the Braves this past offseason, he hit a towering, two-run homer and had four hits against the team that selected him No. 1 overall in the 2005 amateur draft.	The two-time All-Star in six seasons with the Diamondbacks wasn't as good in his encore, striking out with a runner on in the eighth and finishing 0 for 2.	"What he did with Justin tonight was keep it out of spots where he could hurt him," Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson said about Corbin.	Teheran's otherwise-impressive start against the Diamondbacks was derailed, by all things, by an infield double.	The play happened when Parra hit a chopper to the right side in the third inning. Teheran chased after the ball and so did Freeman before both pulled back at the last second. The ball rolled past second baseman Dan Uggla, who was racing to cover first, and Parra ended up at second.	Gregorius followed with a two-run single to center.	Teheran allowed two more hits after that and was lifted for a pinch hitter in the seventh. He allowed two runs on seven hits with three strikeouts and was hurt most by a double that barely left the infield.	"It was my good stuff today," said Teheran, who took his first loss since his major league debut on May 5, 2011, at Philadelphia. "I made good pitches, was getting ahead in counts. It was just one bad play. A difficult play."	Turned out to be just enough for the Diamondbacks and Corbin.	Game notes	 Atlanta CF B.J. Upton didn't play after being hit on the shoulder by a pitch the night before. ... Arizona has scored three runs or fewer in seven straight games. ... Atlanta's Andrelton Simmons snapped an 0-for-21 skid with a bloop single in the eighth. .. Atlanta RHP Tim Hudson will try to bounce back from a shaky outing in the series finale. He allowed six runs on seven hits in the fourth inning against the Giants, but is 4-0 with a 0.94 ERA in five career starts in Arizona. ... RHP Ian Kennedy will start for Arizona after a solid previous start. He allowed two runs in the first inning against the Phillies, but settled down and didn't allow a run over the next six innings. Kennedy has not won since opening day.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Albert Pujols, Josh Hamilton and the Los Angeles Angels did more than just end Jeremy Guthrie's 18-game unbeaten streak. They smashed it to smithereens.	Pujols, Hamilton, Howie Kendrick and Mike Trout all homered off the right-hander in a 6-2 victory over the Kansas City Royals on Tuesday night.	"As you saw tonight, up and down the lineup, we're capable of doing that," Hamilton said. "When you look at what he's been doing as of late, he's been throwing the ball well. So it's encouraging to know you've had good at-bats against a guy like that. It's just good to create a little bit of fuel to the fire. The guys were smiling and having fun."	Guthrie (5-1) yielded five runs and 11 hits over seven innings. He held the franchise record for consecutive starts without a loss while winning his previous 10 decisions. It was his first defeat since Aug. 3 last year, when Texas beat him 5-3 at Kansas City.	"The streak was because of 25 guys that played well behind me every time I was on the mound, and they really picked me up. That's how a streak like that happens," Guthrie said. "Tonight they tried to battle for me, and I couldn't get any momentum on our side. It was one of those nights where I didn't have a good feel and wasn't able to execute pitches."	Hamilton, who batted .212 with 11 RBIs in his first 38 games with the Angels after signing a five-year, $125 million contract in December, drove Guthrie's first pitch to him in the sixth inning far beyond the trees in center field with two outs to increase the lead to 4-2.	"I went back and looked at (some tape from) 2010 -- the end of May and early June, because I struggled the first month and a half of that season," Hamilton said. "I looked at what kind of adjustment I made then and tried to simulate that in BP today and in the game. As the game went on, I saw more pitches and felt good."	The Angels' right fielder, who was the AL MVP in 2010, made his fourth start at designated hitter after being removed from Monday night's series-opening 11-4 loss in the seventh inning because of lightheadedness caused by sinus congestion.	"It was good in Houston and it felt OK in Chicago. Today it felt better," Hamilton said. "I felt like I was seeing the ball better and had a little better pitch selection throughout the game. I felt OK while I was hitting. But like last night, once I would run, I'd kind of feel a little off. So we'll give the medicine a couple of days and see if it kind of works its way out."	Trout ended the scoring in the seventh with his seventh homer, a towering drive over the double-decker bullpen in left field. It was the first time in Guthrie's 10-year career that he allowed four homers in a game.	Jason Vargas (2-3) gave up five hits in seven-plus innings and struck out seven. Both runs against the left-hander were knocked in by the suddenly hot Billy Butler, who had an RBI double in the fourth and a homer in the sixth.	"He mixes speeds well, locates, and he just knows how to pitch," Butler said. "Over the years he's gotten better and better. He knows what he has, knows his stuff and basically knows how to approach hitters. He's a lefty and he throws in the upper 80s (mph), so you have to make him come to you and bring the ball up. That's easier said than done."	Butler opened the scoring with an RBI double. But the Angels responded with two runs in the bottom half, as Pujols launched his sixth homer over both bullpens leading off the inning and Kendrick hit his sixth of the season with two outs.	Trout made it 3-1 in the fifth with a sacrifice fly after the Angels put runners at the corners on singles by J.B. Shuck and Erick Aybar, who returned to the lineup after missing four games because of tightness in his right hamstring.	"It just shows you how fragile a streak like that is and how impressive it is," Butler said. "Jeremy's going to pitch well all year, and he's pitched well to this point. We all have confidence in him, and we know when he goes out there we have a great chance to win every time."	Game notes	 Los Angeles got two runners thrown out at third base by catcher Salvador Perez in the third. ... The Angels are 4-0 when Hamilton is the DH. He is 8-for-25 against Guthrie with three home runs. ... The last pitcher to give up four homers against the Angels in a game was Oakland's Dan Straily on Aug. 8, 2012, in his second big league start. ... Angels LHP C.J. Wilson will match up against LHP Chris Sale of the White Sox for the second time in six days on Friday night. Sale outpitched Wilson with a one-hitter Sunday at Chicago, beating the Angels 3-0.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  Rangers manager Ron Washington kept calm and stuck with his reliable closer even as Joe Nathan pitched himself into serious trouble.	Nathan delivered for his toughest save of the year after Adrian Beltre hit a tiebreaking home run in the 10th inning and Mitch Moreland followed with his second of the game to help Texas edge the Oakland Athletics 6-5 on Tuesday night.	Nathan gave up a run in the bottom of the 10th but escaped a bases-loaded, one-out jam to snap Texas' four-game losing streak to the A's.	"When you've got your closer out there, you tell yourself, 'This is the end, this is your closer, the guy I have to live or die with,'" Washington said. "It was very relaxing. I had all the confidence in the world Joe would get us the three we needed."	Beltre sent a 3-0 pitch from Chris Resop (1-1) to center field with one out in the 10th for his ninth homer of the year. Moreland connected two batters later, giving him three of his nine home runs in the past two games. He also hit a two-run shot in the fourth.	Nathan needed 31 pitches to nail down his 12th save in as many chances this season.	After a pair of one-out walks and a mound visit from pitching coach Mike Maddux, Seth Smith doubled in a run. Nathan intentionally walked Brandon Moss before striking out Daric Barton on seven pitches. The All-Star closer then retired pinch hitter Eric Sogard on a first-pitch groundout to end a game that took 3 hours, 43 minutes.	Tanner Scheppers (3-0) pitched two scoreless innings for the win. Nelson Cruz's second sacrifice fly of the game tied it in the eighth against Ryan Cook.	A's manager Bob Melvin was ejected by first-base umpire D.J. Reyburn for arguing a close call on Barton's groundout that ended the eighth, the third time the reigning AL Manager of the Year has been tossed in 2013.	"I thought for sure from where I was that he was safe, and it wasn't the case," Melvin said. "I think it was very close, but it looked like he was out and he got the call right. I deserved to be thrown out."	The AL West-leading Rangers (25-14) bounced back a night after having their four-game winning streak snapped in a 5-1 loss Monday to the 2012 division champions, who swept Texas in the final three regular-season games last fall to steal away the West crown.	Texas also stopped a five-game skid in the Coliseum with the club's first victory here since July 17 last year. It marked the longest home unbeaten run for the A's in the rivalry since winning eight in a row from June 17, 2003, to April 6, 2004.	"They've had a good run against us here," Nathan said. "They're a tough ballclub and they know how to win games."	Nate Freiman hit a go-ahead double in the sixth after Luke Montz's tying sacrifice fly, but Cook couldn't hold a one-run lead in the eighth.	Josh Donaldson doubled twice among his career high-matching four hits for the A's. But there was no celebratory walk-off this time after Oakland had 14 of them last year.	"We always feel like we have the capability to win at any time, especially when it's late in the game and we're at home," Donaldson said.	A's starter Bartolo Colon allowed three runs and four hits in six innings. He didn't strike out a batter in an outing of at least four innings for the first time in his 16 big league seasons. He issued just his second walk all year in 47 1/3 innings.	Yoenis Cespedes went 0-for-5 a night after he left before the fifth inning with a stomach bug that caused him to vomit twice in the dugout bathroom.	The A's loaded the bases with no outs in the fifth against Rangers starter Derek Holland, who allowed consecutive singles to Smith and Freiman and walked No. 9 hitter Michael Taylor. Holland then induced a double play that brought home Smith, followed by Jed Lowrie's RBI double.	Donaldson doubled leading off the sixth and Oakland tied the game at 3 on Montz's sacrifice fly. Smith then singled to chase Holland, who appeared on track for a third straight win until running into trouble in the fourth and fifth.	Game notes	 The Rangers had three sacrifice flies all season before Nelson's two. ... Moreland became the first Rangers player with a two-homer game this season. It was his fifth career two-homer game, and first since May 17 last year against the A's in Texas. ... Lance Berkman hit his 30th career triple in his 15th big league season. ... A's INF Hiroyuki Nakajima, on the disabled list all season with a strained left hamstring, played for a third consecutive game in a rehab assignment with Triple-A Sacramento. He will have Wednesday off, then play four in a row. ... A's CF Coco Crisp is set to be activated from the disabled list Wednesday after working his way back from a strained left hamstring. Fellow OF Chris Young (strained left quadriceps) will be examined in Oakland, back from his rehab assignment with the River Cats. ... Taylor was optioned to Sacramento after the game to clear roster room for Crisp. ... Oakland pitchers have begun taking batting practice ahead of interleague play at San Francisco on May 29-30. ...

LOS ANGELES --  Clayton Kershaw wanted to give the Dodgers' tired bullpen a rest. He did just that.	Kershaw scattered five hits, struck out 11 and pitched 8 2/3 innings in the Dodgers' 2-0 victory over the Washington Nationals on Tuesday night.	The victory was Kershaw's first since April 28, when he beat the Milwaukee Brewers by a 2-0 margin, and it was his most impressive since his shutout of the San Francisco Giants on opening day.	"Clayton was pretty special from the beginning," Dodger manager Don Mattingly said. "He was rolling right away. He seemed to be on a mission."	Kershaw (4-2) was pulled after Adam LaRoche singled with two outs in the ninth on his career-high 132nd pitch, most by a major league starter since Detroit ace Justin Verlander also threw 132 on Aug. 6 last year against the Yankees, according to STATS. Los Angeles' bullpen had to go six innings on Monday.	The Nationals got an early jump on Kershaw but were unable to take advantage of it. Ryan Zimmerman and Ian Desmond singled with two outs in the first inning, and LaRoche walked to load the bases. However, Kershaw struck out Tyler Moore to end the inning.	"The big thing for me was that first inning," Kershaw said. "I threw 29 pitches, so I really had to fight that pitch count and go deep in the game. We needed a deep game and fortunately I got the pitch count back under control."	The first out of the game, a strikeout of Danny Espinosa, gave Kershaw 1,000 career innings.	"He's an unbelievable pitcher, the best in the game in my opinion," Desmond said.	Nationals pitcher Dan Haren (4-4) was looking to secure his fourth consecutive victory but a troublesome third inning turned out to be costly.	The Dodgers got runners at first and second with two outs in the second inning, but Haren worked his way out of the jam by getting No. 8 batter Dee Gordon to hit a fly ball to right field for the third out.	The Dodgers also got multiple runners on base in the third inning but were better prepared to cash in. Kershaw was hit by a pitch to start the inning and Matt Kemp added a one-out single. Both runners advanced on a wild pitch and scored on cleanup hitter Andre Ethier's sharp single to center.	"Danny made some good pitches, but he had some pitches hit and I think he's trying to do too much," Nationals manager Davey Johnson said. "It's kind of been like that the whole year. He hasn't been himself."	Kershaw kept the Nationals in check after the first inning, retiring 23 of the last 26 batters he faced after the first inning. Zimmerman had three of the Nationals' five hits.	"Zimmerman, I can't get that guy out," Kershaw said. "He owns me so I have to figure that out."	Zimmerman wished he knew the secret.	"He's obviously one of the best pitchers in the game," he said. "I guess you just have to kind of keep it simple. I wish I knew what I was doing so I could tell everyone."	Zimmerman was finally retired with a fly ball to deep right field in the ninth inning.	Game notes	 Nationals OF Bryce Harper sat out after running headfirst into the right-field wall while chasing a fly ball Monday night. The violent collision left the 20-year-old slugger with 11 stitches in his chin and soreness all over his body. He is expected to miss the series finale Wednesday night, too. ... Nationals outfielder Jayson Werth (right hamstring) was scheduled to make two rehabs starts, beginning Tuesday at Potomac, before joining the team in San Diego on Thursday. ... Dodger pitcher Zack Greinke will be activated from the disabled list and start the series finale against the Nationals on Wednesday. Greinke was placed on the disabled list on April 12 after breaking his clavicle in a fight with San Diego Padres outfielder Carlos Quentin. ... Outfielder Matt Kemp batted second in the Dodgers' batting order for the first time this season, and ran his hitting streak to 13 games. It's the first time he's batted from that spot since the 2010 season. ... Pitcher Ted Lilly (strained right rib cage) is scheduled to make a rehab start on Wednesday for Rancho Cucamonga, the Dodgers' Single-A team.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

BALTIMORE --  Not so long ago, the Padres were scuffling for victories no matter the opponent. Now a scrappy roster minus high-profile names is finding ways to win even against one of the American League's best.	Alexi Amarista homered and doubled twice and the San Diego Padres matched their season-high with 17 hits, beating the Baltimore Orioles 8-4 Wednesday for a two-game sweep.	Everth Cabrera had four hits and a walk, and Jedd Gyorko had three singles for the Padres, who are 13-6 after a 5-15 start.	John Baker hit a go-ahead, two-run single in the second against Freddy Garcia (0-2), and Kyle Blanks hit a solo homer in a two-run fourth as San Diego took a 4-1 lead.	"We've been playing well the last three weeks," said Padres manager Bud Black, whose club rallied after losing three straight at Tampa Bay. "Things have turned in a good way. We had a tough series down in Tampa. I liked the way the guys responded today. It was outstanding. We got to their starter. We kept the pressure on, got a lot of base hits."	Every starter had at least one hit for the Padres, including Amarista, who entered the game batting .233 in 73 at-bats. Slotted eighth in the lineup between Blanks and Baker, the lefty-swinging outfielder went the opposite way for a two-run homer off Tommy Hunter in the seventh.	"Every time you have an opportunity to get in there and produce, you have to take advantage of that so you can have some more opportunities to help the team," Amarista said through a translator.	J.J. Hardy and Matt Wieters homered for the Orioles off Jason Marquis (5-2), who won his fourth straight start. Manny Machado had four hits.	In getting swept for the first time this season, the Orioles allowed a season-high 17 hits.	Marquis allowed two runs, seven hits and four walks in five-plus innings. He has a 2.45 ERA in his last four starts.	Garcia gave up four runs and seven hits in 3 2/3 innings, his shortest outing in three starts for the Orioles.	"Not quite as crisp," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. "We just didn't pitch well today. What did we give up, like 17 hits? It wasn't just Freddy. They had some good fortune, too, but they hit a lot of balls hard too. They came in here and swung the bats well."	Baltimore loaded the bases in the first before Wieters hit an inning-ending groundout. The sinkerball-throwing Marquis also escaped damage in the second and fifth by inducing double-play grounders.	"Some days you're not going to feel as good as others, but at the end of the day you have to make pitches in big situations," Marquis said. "I don't want to keep putting myself in those situations, but if you do, got to find a way."	Dale Thayer relieved Marquis with two on in the sixth and retired three in a row.	Baker's second-inning single was one of three straight two-out hits. The fourth inning included Blanks' homer, Amarista's second double of the game and Will Venable's RBI double off T.J. McFarland.	"Baker, Amarista, Blanks get in the lineup, those guys want to be a part of the contribution," Black said. "Today they were."	Machado has at least three hits in four of his last five games and is batting .560 (14 of 25) in that span.	The Orioles finished the first quarter of the season with a 23-17 record, not that Showalter is interested in such road markers.	"This is an impossible game to be perfect at," Showalter said. "I'm not going to get too reflective at the . that's for the Preakness or whatever it is, where they go a quarter-mile and all that other stuff."	Game notes	 The Padres have four series sweeps. ... After throwing 35 pitches on Wednesday, Orioles RHP Miguel Gonzalez (blister) is expected to pitch Friday either in a simulated game or in the minors. Placed on the 15-day DL on May 4, Gonzalez is 2-2 in six starts. ... Padres INF Logan Forsythe (right foot plantar fasciitis) is eligible to come off the 60-day DL on May 22, but will not begin baseball activities this week, Black said. ...Following an off day, the Orioles start a three-game series against Tampa Bay. Jason Hammel (5-1) is slated to start Friday's opener against Jeremy Hellickson (1-2). ... The Padres return home for four games against Washington. Edinson Volquez (3-3) starts for San Diego on Thursday against fellow RHP Stephen Strasburg (1-5).	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DETROIT --  Brandon Barnes stood in center field and felt the wind blowing out a bit -- an ominous sign when Miguel Cabrera is at the plate with the bases loaded and two out in the ninth inning.	Sure enough, Cabrera lifted a deep flyball to right-center, forcing Barnes to race over with the game on the line.	"I just knew if he hit it out there, I'd have to get a good bead on it," Barnes said. "Just try to get under it and not stop until the catch was made."	Barnes caught Cabrera's drive against the wall for the final out, and the Houston Astros avoided a season sweep against the Detroit Tigers with a 7-5 victory Wednesday. Carlos Corporan hit a tiebreaking double in the top of the ninth for the Astros, who lost their first six meetings with the Tigers by a combined 50-12.	Houston barely held on in this one after scoring two runs in the ninth to take the lead. Jose Veras pitched the ninth for his fifth save in seven chances, but he walked two, and when he hit Torii Hunter with an 0-2 pitch, the bases were loaded with two out and Cabrera coming up.	The Triple Crown winner came a few feet from a grand slam, but Barnes -- who entered as a pinch-runner in the top of the inning and stayed in to play center -- had enough room to run it down and make the catch while jumping back a bit into the out-of-town scoreboard.	The previous night, Detroit's Andy Dirks hit a double to almost that same spot. Houston right-hander Lucas Harrell expressed frustration that the ball wasn't caught, and manager Bo Porter met with Harrell before Wednesday's game to discuss the team's philosophy on defensive shifts.	Barnes said he was playing a bit deep for Cabrera, but wasn't too far to either side.	"I was pretty straight up," Barnes said. "I mean, he can hit the ball anywhere."	Corporan and J.D. Martinez homered for Houston, and Avisail Garcia went deep for the Tigers.	Detroit's Al Alburquerque (0-1) walked Martinez starting the ninth, and manager Jim Leyland pulled him.	"It's depressing," Leyland said. "If I had seen any signs that he was going to throw the ball over the plate, I would have left him in. I didn't really want (Phil) Coke against a switch-hitter."	Coke, a left-hander, came on and allowed Corporan's double to the gap in left-center. Matt Dominguez added a sacrifice fly.	Alburquerque has struck out 26 in 14 1/3 innings this year, but he's also walked 13 and thrown six wild pitches.	"Maybe not getting enough work -- I don't know the answer," Leyland said. "He's struggling with his control."	Hector Ambriz (1-2) got the win as Houston stopped a six-game losing streak.	"Sometimes we pitch good but we don't hit. Sometimes we hit but we don't pitch good. Sometimes we put it together like today," Corporan said. "We've been scoring some runs. It takes things like this to turn around some things."	The Astros are without standout second baseman Jose Altuve, on the bereavement list following the death of his grandmother.	The 21-year-old Garcia, playing center field because of Austin Jackson's hamstring injury, hit his first major league homer in the second, a three-run shot to left-center that gave the Tigers a 4-1 lead.	Detroit starter Max Scherzer couldn't hold it. He allowed a double to Jake Elmore to start the fourth, then balked him to third. Carlos Pena hit a run-scoring single, and after a walk to Chris Carter, Martinez hit his third homer of the year, a no-doubter to left-center that landed near Willie Horton's retired No. 23 on the brick facade well behind the visiting bullpen at Comerica Park. The three-run shot put the Astros ahead 5-4.	Scherzer allowed five runs and five hits in seven innings. He struck out seven and walked three.	Houston starter Dallas Keuchel allowed five runs -- four earned -- and seven hits in 5 2/3 innings.	Detroit tied it at 5 with an unearned run in the sixth. With two out, shortstop Marwin Gonzalez misplayed Victor Martinez's grounder for an error. Jhonny Peralta followed with a single, and Matt Tuiasosopo tied it with a single.	Corporan opened the scoring with a second-inning solo homer. The Tigers tied it in the bottom of the inning on an RBI single by Brayan Pena, and Garcia followed with his home run.	Game notes	 Keuchel and Detroit reliever Drew Smyly were roommates while playing college baseball at Arkansas. ... The Astros have Thursday off. Detroit sends ace Justin Verlander (4-3) to the mound at Texas in a terrific pitching matchup against Yu Darvish (6-1) of the Rangers.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MINNEAPOLIS -- Adam Dunn homered twice, doubled and drove in five runs, powering the Chicago White Sox past the Minnesota Twins 9-4 on Wednesday.	Dunn hit a pair of two-run shots for his 35th career multihomer game. He's hit three home runs in the last two games and has nine this year. Dayan Viciedo also went deep for the second straight day, helping Dylan Axelrod (1-3) pick up his first victory this season.	Mike Pelfrey (3-4) was hit hard yet again, failing to record an out in the fifth inning. Dunn was the last batter he faced, delivering an RBI double that put the White Sox ahead 4-2. The 33-year-old slugger hit both of his homers with two outs, in the third against Pelfrey and the eighth off Josh Roenicke.	Dunn went 3 for 4 with a walk and still has the third-worst batting average in the majors, at .156, for players with the minimum amount of at-bats. But the White Sox didn't sign him to hit singles, and the 6-foot-6, 285-pound first baseman can still drive a ball deep with the best of them.	Nine of his 20 hits this season are home runs. After leading the majors with 222 strikeouts last year, Dunn has fanned 48 times in 2013, another 200-plus pace. Houston's Chris Carter has 60 strikeouts, tops in either league.	Axelrod finished 5 1/3 innings, allowing nine hits, three runs and one walk. The right-hander struck out four, including Ryan Doumit and Oswaldo Arcia in consecutive at-bats in the fifth after Josh Willingham was hit by a pitch and Justin Morneau singled to start the inning.	Chicago trailed 2-0 after two, but the Twins squandered opportunities to build Pelfrey a bigger lead he could've used.	They started the game with three straight hits for the first time this season but had runners on first and second with no outs who didn't score. Then they stranded men at the corners at the end of the second inning.	Jamey Carroll and Joe Mauer each had three hits, and Morneau added a pair of singles on his 32nd birthday. Eduardo Escobar homered off Axelrod, Willingham drove in two runs and Carroll added an RBI single against reliever Matt Lindstrom.	Pelfrey's hold on a spot in the rotation has been slipping. The right-hander, barely one year removed from Tommy John ligament replacement surgery in his throwing elbow, saw his ERA spike to 6.57, the third-highest in the majors among those with a qualified number of innings.	Opponents are batting .339 against him, also the third-highest in the majors. Pelfrey allowed eight hits, five runs and two walks while striking out three.	Game notes	Twins RHP Vance Worley's ERA (7.15) and BAA (.379) are still worse than Pelfrey's. ... The White Sox sent 2B Gordon Beckham (broken left wrist) and INF Angel Sanchez (back injury) on minor league rehab assignments. "You feel good that they're going back out," manager Robin Ventura said. "They'll see how it feels and they'll make sure they're healthy. The main thing is to get them going again." ... The White Sox have won 24 of their last 33 games against the Twins. ... The Twins are off Thursday before starting a three-game series against the Red Sox. Worley will pitch for the Twins against Clay Buchholz, who is unbeaten in six decisions this season. ... The White Sox travel west to finish the road trip with a four-game series against the Angels on Thursday. LHP Jose Quintana (2-1, 3.72 ERA) will take the mound for the White Sox against RHP Jerome Williams (2-1, 3.06) of the Angels.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- If he had to choose one highlight play, Nelson Cruz preferred his run-saving, diving catch to his towering, three-run homer.	Those contributions with the bat and glove played a huge part in the first-place Texas Rangers holding momentum in the AL West with a 6-2 victory against the Oakland Athletics on Wednesday for a winning series.	Cruz connected for his 10th homer in the fifth, then chased down Brandon Moss' line drive to the gap in right-center for a defensive gem to end the sixth with Oakland runners on first and second.	"I had four or five steps before I got to the ball, I thought I had a chance before I dived," Cruz said. "I think the catch in that situation was nice."	Alexi Ogando thought so. He went on to earn his first career win against Oakland.	Ogando (4-2) didn't allow a hit until Eric Sogard's leadoff double in the sixth. The right-hander won his second straight decision and earned only his second victory in seven outings since consecutive wins starting the season.	Cruz greeted reliever Jesse Chavez in the fifth with a first-pitch drive to left, highlighting the Rangers' four-run inning.	"Hey, I'm an aggressive hitter," Cruz said, "I'm not going to change my approach."	Lance Berkman hit a two-run single and Adrian Beltre added an RBI single a day after hitting a 10th-inning home run. Elvis Andrus stole his ninth and 10th bases as the Rangers won their first series in Oakland since Sept. 20-22, 2011.	Ogando was thrilled with Cruz's day -- especially that pretty catch.	"Wow," the pitcher said. "It was an excellent play that helped so much. It's what we needed at that moment."	Derek Norris hit a sacrifice fly in the sixth for Oakland's first run. Coco Crisp, fresh off the disabled list, added one of his own in the seventh.	Last Oct. 3, Ogando entered in relief of the Rangers' 12-5 loss in Game No. 162 and was tagged for four runs in the eighth inning as the A's rallied to grab the AL West crown away from the Rangers.	Now, with the AL West-leading Rangers on a nice roll in mid-May, Ogando's first road win in his last six outings gave Texas some momentum heading home for a key four-game series with the Tigers starting Thursday.	The right-hander allowed two runs on four hits in six innings in his majors-leading seventh road start, his second ever against the A's and first in the Coliseum.	Cruz's home run gave the Rangers 14 in their last six games -- including three Tuesday night, two of them by Moreland.	"We've been playing real well all season long," Cruz said. "The offense has been getting clutch hits all year long, and the way Ogando threw was nice."	The Rangers wrapped up a 6-3 trip, and these clubs meet again for three games beginning Monday in Arlington. Texas played its majors-high 25th road game, but begins a four-game series against AL champion Detroit on Thursday night.	After losing the series opener 5-1, first-place Texas snapped a five-game losing streak in Oakland with a 6-5 win in 10 innings Tuesday night on the way to a third winning series in the last four.	"We wanted to come here and play good baseball and we're fortunate we did," manager Ron Washington said.	The A's loaded the bases with one out against Rangers reliever Michael Kirkman in the seventh, but got only Crisp's sacrifice fly.	Oakland starter Dan Straily (1-2) had his problems, too.	He plunked Ian Kinsler and Andrus back to back to load the bases with two outs in the third, then Berkman's single up the middle gave the Rangers the lead.	Straily avoided further damage in the fourth. After consecutive one-out walks to Mitch Moreland and David Murphy, and a wild pitch that advanced them both, Straily got a pair of flyball outs to escape unscathed. He walked four and struck out two in 4 1/3 innings of his second straight losing start and fourth consecutive winless outing.	"We're not playing well right now and we have to power through this, win some games and get on a roll," manager Bob Melvin said.	Crisp returned from a strained left hamstring and went 0 for 3 in his usual leadoff spot and playing center field.	Game notes	Rangers C Geovany Soto got a day off. ... A's LHP Brett Anderson experienced further soreness in his sprained right ankle after going through pitcher's fielding practice Tuesday. "Brett won't pitch tomorrow and maybe not in the foreseeable future here," Melvin said. "We're just not past the soreness that he's getting." ... After getting a break Wednesday, Oakland OF Chris Young (strained left quadriceps) is scheduled to play one more rehab outing Thursday with Triple-A Sacramento with the hope he will be activated from the DL on Friday ahead of a home weekend series against the Kansas City Royals. ... Melvin will spend Thursday's off day next door at Oracle Arena cheering on the Golden State Warriors in Game 6 of the Western Conference semifinals against San Antonio. ... Texas RHP Yu Darvish (6-1) faces Tigers ace Justin Verlander (4-3) in an anticipated matchup Thursday. The Rangers won seven of 10 vs. Detroit last year for their most victories in the season series since going 8-3 in 1998. "I'm just looking forward to beating Verlander," Rangers manager Ron Washington said. ... Rangers RHP Justin Miller is scheduled to be sent on rehab assignment Friday. He is on the 60-day DL recovering from elbow ligament-replacement surgery.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PHOENIX -- Tim Hudson threw Eric Chavez a steady diet of cut fastballs and sliders Wednesday and the Arizona Diamondbacks third baseman feasted.	Chavez drove in three runs, Paul Goldschmidt hit three doubles and the Diamondbacks beat Hudson and the Atlanta Braves 5-3.	With the Diamondbacks trailing 3-1 with one out in the fifth, Jason Kubel pinch-hit for Kennedy and walked. Gerardo Parra reached on an infield hit and Didi Gregorius followed with an RBI single.	Hudson struck out Goldschmidt looking and had two strikes on Chavez before his one-time Oakland Athletics teammate doubled to left, scoring Parra and Gregorius to make it 4-3.	"He was throwing me a lot of sliders today," Chavez said. "I'm not really sure why. I don't know if they picked up something on film. He told me that was a really good at-bat and I told him I was (mad) because he broke two of my bats. It was just good old fun. I love Huddy like a brother."	Hudson agreed he may have gone to the cutter one time too many.	"I thought I made some good pitches to Chavez, especially the last one," Hudson said. "But he stayed with it and hit it the other way. I felt like I really had him where I wanted him. Looking back, we might have gone back to that cutter a little too much in that at-bat."	Cody Ross added an RBI single to cap the fifth as the Diamondbacks won the final two games of the series after a 10-1 loss in the opener.	Ian Kennedy (2-3) yielded three runs and five hits in five innings. He struck out seven and walked three for his first win since Opening Day.	"It's been awhile since it was a win," Kennedy said. "I'll take any one. After a while, it does get frustrating. I want to get my innings up but I didn't have my best stuff."	Heath Bell pitched the ninth for his sixth save in eight chances.	The Diamondbacks finally responded with runners in scoring position. After going 5 for 56 of its past eight games, Arizona was 5 for 8 with runners in scoring position.	"We hope it gets much better," said Arizona manager Kirk Gibson. "I saw better approaches as well."	Hudson (4-3) had been 7-0 in nine career starts against Arizona before he got tagged. He allowed five runs and eight hits in five innings -- he's given up 11 runs over 8 2/3 innings in his last two starts.	Freddie Freeman doubled twice and singled for the Braves.	The Braves put runners on first and second against David Hernandez in the eighth but Jordan Schafer flied out and Goldschmidt fielded a hard shot by Andrelton Simmons to first base to end the inning.	After cruising through the first two innings, Kennedy was undone partially by a botched defensive play in the third.	Schafer reached on a two-out infield single and Simmons followed with a line drive toward third base. Chavez jumped, but the ball bounced off the palm of his glove and fell to the ground as Simmons sprinted to the bag for an infield single.	Kennedy then walked Justin Upton on five pitches to load the bases, then walked Freeman on four pitches to score Schafer for a 1-0 lead.	Freeman hit a two-run double in the fifth that put Atlanta ahead 3-1.	"For losing two of three, you feel like we won a couple of those games the way we hit the ball," said Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez. "It's just the way it goes sometimes. I don't know how many times I felt like the ball was going to go through the infield and it was a line drive at somebody."	Arizona took a 1-0 lead in the first when Goldschmidt doubled and Chavez singled.	Game notes	Chavez has hit safely in six of his past seven games and is 9 for 18 in that stretch. ... Upton went 1 for 3 with a pair of walks to finish his first series back at Chase Field 5 for 10 with a home run. ... Goldschmidt's 11 doubles make him the first NL player with at least 10 doubles and 10 home runs. ... Freeman has 14 RBIs in 21 games since coming off the disabled list on April 22. ... Both teams have off days on Thursday. ... Diamondbacks RHP Trevor Cahill (2-4) will get the start Friday at Marlins Park against Kevin Slowey (1-3) and Miami. Braves LHP Paul Maholm (4-4) faces Hyun-Jin Ryu (4-2) and the Dodgers at Turner Field on Friday. Cahill was allowed two runs or fewer in four straight starts.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- The Boston Red Sox pulled out of an offensive funk to help Jon Lester stay unbeaten.	Lester pitched seven solid innings and Stephen Drew hit his second career grand slam during an eight-run third inning that keyed a 9-2 victory over AL Cy Young winner David Price and the Tampa Bay Rays on Wednesday night.	"It's bound to turn around," Drew said after the Red Sox won for just the third time in their last 12 games. "We know the past couple games haven't been too good with runners in scoring position, so tonight was a great night to have and hopefully we can keep it going."	Price (1-4) departed from the marquee pitching matchup because of a left triceps strain during Boston's eight-run third inning, which Drew finished with his towering homer off Jamey Wright.	Rays manager Joe Maddon said Price had a MRI and that the injury doesn't appear to be serious. Price said he hasn't ruled out the possibility of making his next scheduled start on Monday, although Maddon said that's unlikely.	"It's just something I take pride in, being available every fifth day and being out there for my team," Price said. "I don't know how that's looking right now, but I'll just get re-evaluated (Thursday). The biggest thing is going to be how I feel. Hopefully I can come in and play catch. That's what I have on my mind right now, so we'll see."	Coming off a one-hit, complete game shutout of Toronto, Lester (6-0) allowed two runs and eight hits to help end the Rays' season-high six-game winning streak.	The Red Sox, meanwhile, stopped a three-game losing streak that's been part of a May slide. They are 5-9 this month after going a major league-best 18-8 in April.	"We haven't been scoring a bunch of runs lately and (the 8-run inning) takes a lot of pressure off so I could just go out and execute pitches," Lester said.	"We broke out with eight runs in the one inning, and it gave Jon a cushion to pitch," Boston manager John Farrell said.	"It goes back to us controlling the strike zone, putting up quality at-bats," Farrell added. "When we're right and we're clicking offensively, that's when we grind deep into each at-bat, and I thought we did that multiple times tonight. ... We had a good offensive approach."	Price left with one out in the third inning after giving up an RBI single to David Ortiz. The left-hander walked toward the plate after delivering the pitch to the Red Sox designated hitter and appeared to grimace.	Maddon, pitching coach Jim Hickey, a team trainer and the entire Rays infield joined Price on the mound. Price walked off the field after a brief consultation and was replaced by Wright.	"I didn't see exactly when it happened. I saw him motion to come on out to the mound," Maddon said, adding that he wasn't sure if Price was injured on his final pitch to Ortiz or earlier in the inning.	"We had him checked out, had the MRI done," the manager said. "Nothing seems to be serious, but we'll make a better call (Thursday)."	A 20-game winner last year, Price has struggled this season. Tampa Bay has lost seven of his nine starts, and Price uncharacteristically has given up eight leads over his last seven outings.	The Rays' ace has been bothered by allergies since before the start of spring training, but Price said this week he'd never use that as an excuse for his performance. He gave up two-out doubles to Dustin Pedroia in the first and Will Middlebrooks in the second without allowing further damage.	The Rays weren't as fortunate in the third, when Price walked Drew and gave up a single to Jacoby Ellsbury to begin Boston's biggest inning of the season.	Pedroia's RBI single gave the Red Sox a 1-0 lead. Ortiz's opposite-field single that just eluded diving third baseman Evan Longoria made it 2-0.	Mike Napoli doubled and Jonny Gomes singled off Wright to drive in the final two runs charged to Price, who allowed four runs and five hits in 2 1/3 innings. Jarrod Saltalamacchia walked with two outs to load the bases for Drew, who lifted a 1-1 pitch into the half-filled right-field stands at Tropicana Field.	Pedroia has a seven-game hitting streak, and he's had multiple hits in six of those games. Middlebrooks hit a solo homer off Kyle Farnsworth in the eighth.	Desmond Jennings tripled to drive in Tampa Bay's first run, then scored when Ben Zobrist grounded out.	Price has not won at Tropicana Field since July 19, 2012, a stretch covering eight starts. ... Boston RHP Andrew Bailey (right biceps strain) felt fine one day after a bullpen session and will pitch in a simulated game Thursday. A decision on whether he will be activated from the 15-day disabled list or pitch in a minor league game will be made after the outing. ... Red Sox LHP Franklin Morales (lower back strain) is scheduled to make his fourth minor league appearance Saturday with Triple-A Pawtucket. ... Tampa Bay's Alex Cobb (4-2) will start Thursday night's series finale, his first outing since striking out 13 in 4 2/3 innings against San Diego to become the first pitcher in major league history to fan that many batters in an appearance lasting fewer than five innings. The Red Sox will counter with LHP Felix Doubront (3-1).	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

NEW YORK --  Raul Ibanez was more than happy to turn those welcome back calls of "Ra-uuul!" into a good old Bronx cheer.	Ibanez again treated Yankee Stadium as his personal playground, hitting a grand slam and two-run homer Wednesday night to help the Seattle Mariners rout New York 12-2.	"I can't tell that much of a difference even though when you hear it, depending on how you're doing, you know," Ibanez said with a sly smile.	Ibanez's slam came during a seven-run first inning. Yankees backup shortstop Alberto Gonzalez got the final out in the ninth inning in his first professional pitching appearance.	Every Seattle starter had at least one of its season-high 16 hits and Jesus Montero was the only starter who failed to score a run in the Mariners' best output this year.	The Mariners chased Phil Hughes after he got only two outs in the first. Trying to preserve his bullpen, Yankees manager Joe Girardi had Brett Marshall throw 108 pitches in his big league debut, then brought in Gonzalez.	"We need one out," Girardi said. "It's not something I want to do, but for me to bring in another pitcher. I think it doesn't make a lot of sense there."	Ibanez has connected three times in the first two games of his return to the ballpark in which -- last season at 40 years old -- he electrified crowds in late September and October with several key homers in the Yankees' run to the AL championship series.	This time, the cheers were replaced by boos for Hughes (2-3) when Ibanez connected for his 11th career slam. Ibanez homered again in the fifth inning off Marshall.	"I said silliness happens here. There's also something that happens here with Raul," teammate Brendan Ryan said. "It's awesome."	Ibanez thinks it's a coincidence that he had another special performance here. He says it's not Yankee Stadium; his swing has been improving the past week or so. Ibanez raised his average that was .158 at the end of April to .224 after his 2 for 5 night.	Kendrys Morales, Michael Morse and Michael Saunders each drove in a run in the highest-scoring first inning at the stadium that opened in 2009.	Kyle Seager added a three-run shot off Marshall in the sixth.	"He saved the bullpen is what he did for us," Girardi said of Marshall's 5 2/3 innings. "That's not easy being a rookie, first time out there, and being asked to do that."	The first inning outburst made it easy for Japanese right-hander Hisashi Iwakuma (5-1), who came in with a 1.74 ERA. He gave up solo homers to Vernon Wells -- his 10th -- and Chris Stewart.	Delivering dastardly breaking pitches with a motion that has a lengthy pause when he reaches the top of his high leg kick, Iwakuma kept the Yankees off-balance. He gave up a season-high eight hits and two runs without walking a batter for the second straight start. Iwakuma struck out four.	"Those were big gifts," Iwakuma said through a translator of the run support.	After getting Saunders to lead off the game with a fly to left field on the second pitch of the game, nothing was easy for Hughes in the shortest start of his career.	Dustin Ackley walked and Seager singled before Morales had an RBI single. Morse followed with another RBI hit before Hughes walked Justin Smoak to load the bases ahead of Ibanez.	Former Yankees prospect Montero singled and, after a forceout, Saunders, the 10th batter of the inning, doubled in a run to make it 7-0 and chase Hughes. The right-hander never failed to make it out of the first in his 110 previous starts.	"When I tried to go to changeup, slider, curveball, it seemed like nothing was there," Hughes said. "Nothing I could really go to to try and find a way out of it, and that's what happens."	Ibanez hit an opposite-field drive to left field in the fifth and Seager's long ball came in the sixth to make it 12-2. The Yankees bullpen remained empty, leaving it up to Marshall to pitch deep into the game.	With a chance for his first career three-homer game, Ibanez popped out foul in the sixth to David Adams, another Yankees player making his big league debut -- on his 26th birthday.	Ibanez flied out in the eighth. He has 17 career mulithomer games. His previous came in the Bronx against Oakland on Sept. 22 for the Yankees against Oakland.	Gonzalez, acquired last week from the Chicago Cubs, moved from shortstop to the mound with two outs in the ninth and runners on first and third. He retired Robert Andino on a routine flyball.	Game notes	 Adams got his first career hit in the sixth. ... Mariners manager Eric Wedge said LHP Felix Hernandez was "pretty sore this morning" but the ace should be fine after tweaking his back Tuesday night. Wedge said he doesn't think there will be any alteration of his routine between starts. ... Seattle OF Franklin Gutierrez (strained right hamstring) ran Tuesday and could begin a rehab assignment Thursday or Friday. ... The Yankees designated 3B Chris Nelson for assignment.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PITTSBURGH -- Yovani Gallardo has spent much of his career toying with the Pittsburgh Pirates.	On Wednesday night, the Pirates finally found a way to flip the script on their nemesis.	Neil Walker laced a two-run single off the Milwaukee right-hander in the sixth inning, Wandy Rodriguez pitched seven strong innings and the Pirates beat the Brewers 3-1 on Wednesday.	Gallardo (3-3) came in 7-0 in his last eight starts against the Pirates but was outdueled by Rodriguez and outsmarted by Walker, who guessed right when he stepped to the plate with the bases loaded and one out.	"He has to come to you," Walker said. "He has to throw strikes and if you stay in your own approach and don't go chasing pitchers pitches and more often than not you're going to at least hit a barrel."	When the switch-hitting Walker, batting left-handed, saw the cutter he was expecting, he slapped it up the middle for his first RBIs in nearly a month. The second baseman came off the 15-day disabled list with a hand injury on Monday then gave the Pirates the jolt they needed to post consecutive victories over the Brewers for the first time in nearly four years.	"These are important moving forward for confidence," Walker said. "But being at home here, we feel like it doesn't matter who we play, we need to take advantage of that home field advantage."	The Pirates moved six games above .500 for the first time this season with the victory. Rodriguez (4-2), who was knocked around by the Brewers when he faced them last month, responded by expertly working himself out of trouble spots the first four innings before eventually giving away to Pittsburgh's red-hot bullpen.	Rodriguez (4-2) gave up six hits, walking one and striking out five then watched Jason Grilli worked the ninth for his National League-leading 16th save.	"It was the start we needed, a little bit better than their guy," Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said. "Their guy was good too."	Gallardo almost always is when he faces Pittsburgh. He entered the game with a 10-2 lifetime record against the Pirates and was solid enough to make it 11-2 after surrendering three hits over six innings, walking four and striking out four. He just received little help offensively.	Rickie Weeks hit his third homer to provide Milwaukee's only run. Norichika Aoki had two hits for the Brewers but couldn't stop Milwaukee from falling to 2-10 in its last 12 games.	"Guys are giving it all they have," Gallardo said. "It's not like we're trying hard. It's just the way the game is, sometimes. You've just got to keep grinding it out."	Milwaukee has dominated the Pirates over the last six years, winning 73 percent of the meetings between the two clubs and knocked Rodriguez around during his last start against the Brewers two weeks ago.	The left-hander was rocked for seven runs in 4 2/3 innings of an eventual 10-4 loss on April 29.	Things were decidedly smoother this time around.	Working both sides of the plate, Rodriguez kept the Brewers off balance and buckled down when pressed. Milwaukee put runners in scoring position in each of the first four innings but had nothing to show for it.	No missed opportunity loomed larger than the one the Brewers created in the fourth when Jonathan Lucroy led off with a triple to right. Rodriguez induced Carlos Gomez and Weeks to hit harmless infield flies before Alex Gonzalez rolled a routine grounder to shortstop to end the threat.	"He picked it up and laid it down for us and he battled from start to finish," Hurdle said.	Gallardo was just as sharp. Pittsburgh managed just one hit through the first six innings before Starling Marte doubled to center leading off the sixth. Andrew McCutchen and Gaby Sanchez worked one out walks to load the bases to set up Walker's tiebreaking single.	The hit ended an 0-for-23 skid with runners in scoring position by the Pirates and was just enough to deal Gallardo a rare loss to Pittsburgh	"The pitch was off the plate and below the knees," Gallardo said. "Sometimes, you've got to tip your cap to the hitter. I threw it where I wanted to throw."	Weeks drew the Brewers within a run in the seventh with a homer to the bleachers in left field off Rodriguez but baseball's best one-two punch out of the bullpen shut the door.	Set-up man Mark Melancon retired the Brewers in order in the eighth and Grilli did the same in the ninth as Pittsburgh remained undefeated (17-0) when leading after seven innings.	The Pirates gave Grilli a little extra cushion in the eighth when McCutchen scored from third after Weeks threw wide of first after making a diving stop on a grounder by Walker.	Game notes	Pittsburgh recalled INF Jordy Mercer on Wednesday after placing John McDonald on the 15-day disabled list with a bad back. Mercer started at shortstop and went 1 for 2 ... The Brewers plan to call up veteran reliever Francisco Rodriguez on Thursday. The 31-year-old Rodriguez signed a minor-league deal with the Brewers in April. The four-time All-Star went 2-7 with a 4.38 ERA in 78 games with Milwaukee in 2012 ... ... Umpire Fieldin Culbreth worked at third base on Wednesday night. He left Tuesday night's game after being struck in the neck with a ball ... The series concludes on Thursday. Hiram Burgos (1-1, 6.86 ERA) starts for the Brewers against Pittsburgh's Francisco Liriano (1-0, 1.69).	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

TORONTO -- Ryan Vogelsong's 100th career start might have been his last for a while.	J.P. Arencibia and Adam Lind each hit two-run home runs, Ramon Ortiz won for the first time since 2011 and the Toronto Blue Jays won their season-high fourth straight game Wednesday night, beating Vogelsong and the San Francisco Giants 11-3.	Vogelsong (1-4) allowed a season-high eight runs, three earned, in two innings, his shortest start of the season. The struggling right-hander, who has lost three of his past four starts, walked two and struck out one. His ERA rose to 8.06.	"They hit some pitches that were really good and they hit some pitches that were bad," Vogelsong said. "That's been the theme."	Giants manager Bruce Bochy wouldn't say whether Vogelsong, who has allowed 11 homers in 41 1/3 innings, would make his next start, scheduled for May 20 against Washington.	"I'm not going to guarantee anything right now," Bochy said.	Bochy also acknowledged having postgame discussions with general manager Brian Sabean and said there'd be more discussions as the Giants went to Colorado to begin a four-game series with the Rockies.	"We'll talk about this internally," Bochy said. "I don't have much to say right now about what we may do, our options or whatever. (Vogelsong) is fighting, I'll say that. I know he's taking it hard. He'll get on track."	Like his manager, Vogelsong remains convinced there'll be better days ahead.	"Things have got to turn in my favor here eventually," he said. "I shattered two bats and sawed them off really good and they both went for hits. It's got to change here, I've just got to ride it out."	The NL West-leading Giants allowed double-digit runs in consecutive games for the first time this season. One night after allowing six runs in the first, they gave up five runs in the opening inning of this one.	"Groundhog day," Bochy said. "That's unlike us. I can't think back to when we had two games, identical games, where we made mistakes there in the first inning. The big number there killed us, took us out of our game. It's hard to explain. But it happened and now we've got to move on."	Toronto, who had an 11-batter first in Tuesday's win, recorded consecutive bat-around first innings for the first time since April 1994.	"We're really swinging the bats now," manager John Gibbons said. "We're on a nice little roll."	The last-place Blue Jays, who came in with the fewest runs of any AL East team, have 33 runs and 41 hits in their past three games. They beat Boston 12-4 on Sunday and won 10-6 in Tuesday's series opener against the Giants.	"Earlier in the year we were having a tough time scoring runs but, like we've said before, there's a track record with the guys in this clubhouse," Arencibia said. "There's too many guys that have done a lot of good things offensively for a long time to have that happen for an extended period."	Ortiz (1-1) allowed one run and six hits in seven innings for his first win since beating the New York Mets in a relief appearance with the Chicago Cubs on Sept. 11, 2011. He had not won as a starter since beating Seattle while pitching for Minnesota in April 2007.	"The key right now is that I have a lot of confidence in all my pitches," Ortiz said. "When you have confidence in your pitch you can throw it any count and that's what we are doing right now."	Mickey Storey worked the final two innings for the Blue Jays, who have won seven of 10.	Pablo Sandoval gave the Giants an early lead with a sacrifice fly off Ortiz in the first, but the Blue Jays answered with five in the bottom half, taking advantage of two San Francisco errors.	Melky Cabrera flied out, Jose Bautista reached when Marco Scutaro dropped a bloop into shallow right and Edwin Encarnacion walked before Arencibia hit a liner to center that got past Angel Pagan for a two-run error.	"Our outfielders seemed like they were struggling at times picking up the ball," Bochy said. "The ball was carrying well. Still, we're disappointed we came in here and put together two games like this. It's not our type of baseball. Really, it's amazing that we had two games, very similar, where in the first inning we got knocked out."	Lind followed with a two-run blast to right, his third homer. Three batters later, Emilio Bonifacio capped the rally with an RBI single.	The Blue Jays added three more in the second. Cabrera led off with a double over the head of Hunter Pence in right and scored on Bautista's single. Encarnacion flied out before Arencibia homered into the second deck in left, his 10th.	Toronto made it 10-1 with two runs off Chad Gaudin in the third. Bautista hit an RBI double and Encarnacion added a sacrifice fly. The Blue Jays got one more in the sixth when Colby Rasmus doubled home Brett Lawrie from first base.	Buster Posey hit an RBI double off Storey in the eighth and Brett Pill added a sacrifice fly.	Scutaro went 1 for 3 with a ninth-inning single, extending his hitting streak to 14 games. Scutaro had recorded seven consecutive multihit games, the longest streak by a Giants player since Bill Terry had eight straight in 1934.	Game notes	Cabrera underwent an MRI before the game and was diagnosed with irritation in his left hamstring and right quadriceps. ... The Giants failed to homer for the first time in seven games. ... Posey started at DH Wednesday, with Bochy saying there's a "good chance" Posey will catch all four games at Colorado. ... Giants RHP Matt Cain did not travel to Toronto for this brief series, remaining behind in San Francisco. Cain is scheduled to start Thursday at Colorado against Rockies RHP Jhoulys Chacin.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

MIAMI -- Shin-Soo Choo's first home run landed in the nightclub beyond the left-field fence, catching by surprise revelers distracted by the Miami Heat on TV.	His second homer dropped into the right-field bullpen amid Marlins relievers, who saw ball coming.	Clearing the hard-to-reach fence both ways, Choo went 4-for-5 Wednesday and helped the Cincinnati Reds extend their winning streak to a season-best five games by beating Miami 4-0.	Mike Leake and three relievers combined on an 11-hitter for the Reds.	Choo hit solo homers in the fourth and sixth innings, giving him nine this season. His ninth career multihomer game came in a spacious stadium where sluggers tend to struggle.	"This ballpark is big," Choo said. "Some balls fly, some don't. I'm not thinking about hitting homers. I'm just swinging hard."	The two-homer effort was his second in eight days, but he came into the game batting only .225 in May.	"I haven't been feeling great," he said, "but tonight I hit the ball on the barrel."	Leake (3-2) went 6 2/3 innings, pitched around nine hits and lowered his ERA to 3.72. Reds ace Johnny Cueto is expected to return next week after being sidelined since mid-April by a sore arm, and manager Dusty Baker bristled when asked if Leake's performance saved his spot in the rotation.	"Who's talking about keeping his spot?" Baker said. "He's doing better than some of the guys on our staff. I don't understand why it was coming down between him and somebody else anyway. Leake has pitched well. It shouldn't have been thought of. We'll worry about that when we get there."	Leake walked one and hit a batter. The Marlins had 14 baserunners but stranded 12 and hit into two double plays.	"I definitely was out of the stretch quite a bit," Leake said. "They hit a few balls hard, but a few of them weren't hit too hard."	Miami managed three infield hits among their 10 singles but went 1-for-10 with runners in scoring position.	"We're just not getting it done," manager Mike Redmond said. "I don't know how to dress it up any more than that. I'm trying to be patient, but at the end of the day, somebody's got to step up and get a hit with a guy in scoring position."	With the home team giving the crowd of 14,866 little to cheer about, the biggest roars came when highlights of the Heat's playoff victory over the Chicago Bulls two miles away were shown on the video scoreboard.	The Marlins were shut out for the seventh time, most in the majors. Cincinnati climbed a season-high eight games above .500 and improved to 5-1 against Miami, which has lost four in a row.	The Marlins fell to 0-10 this year with the retractable roof open in their stadium. The ball carries better in those conditions, and Choo twice sent it flying off Alex Sanabia (2-6).	Choo also led off the game with a single and scored on a double by NL RBI leader Brandon Phillips. Joey Votto added two hits and an RBI for the Reds, who improved to 20-6 when they score first.	Choo's four hits tied a career high, and he raised his average to .322. He improved to 5-for-5 lifetime against Sanabia.	"Other than that he's batting like 1.000 off me, there's not much to say," Sanabia said. The right-hander allowed four runs in six innings and has lost five consecutive starts.	The Reds led 4-0 in the seventh when Miami mounted a threat. With runners at second and third, Sean Marshall came on and struck out rookie Derek Dietrich with a 3-2 curve to end the inning.	Miami put two runners aboard again in the ninth. Aroldis Chapman then threw seven fastballs of at least 100 mph to Dietrich, who finally struck out looking on a changeup.	"That guy can bring it," Dietrich said. "He made a great pitch when he needed to."	The Marlins rank last in the majors in wins at home, where they're 5-13.	Game notes	Cincinnati 3B Todd Frazier, batting .229, was given the night off. ... Reds starters have allowed one earned run in 22 1/3 innings over the past three games. ... ... Miami's Chris Coghlan singled in the seventh to improve to 6 for 18 as a pinch hitter. ... Cincinnati RHP Mat Latos will try to win his fifth consecutive decision in the series finale Thursday against rookie Jose Fernandez.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CHICAGO -- Jeff Samardzija mixed a strong start with an impressive performance at the plate.	Samardzija hit a two-run home run and pitched eight sharp innings for his first win since Opening Day and the Chicago Cubs beat the Colorado Rockies 6-3 on Wednesday night.	David DeJesus led off the first inning with a home run and Anthony Rizzo had two hits for the Cubs, who won back-to-back series for the first time this season.	Reid Brignac hit a pinch-hit homer for the Rockies, who finished a 2-4 road trip.	Samardzija (2-5) allowed two runs and five hits. He struck out seven and walked two, but the highlight came on his two-run homer in the second inning.	"I need to slow down around the bases and enjoy it a little bit. It doesn't happen too often. We work a lot in hitting. (Pitching coach Chris) Bosio has us hitting out there every day in the cages. It's an important at-bat," Samardzija said. "You just can't accept the out as a pitcher. It's the same out as every other. You roll the lineup over and get the top coming up and it changes the game."	Colorado starter Jon Garland (3-4) allowed three runs and seven hits in five innings. He struck out four and walked one.	"I don't want to come out of these games, it's not my choice. I'd like to keep going and see if I can continue to give the team a chance. It almost seems like I'm hurting the team more than I'm helping the team only going five," Garland said.	DeJesus snapped Garland's 18 1/3 scoreless inning streak against the Cubs with a leadoff home run into the left-field bleachers in the first inning. It was DeJesus' second leadoff homer of the season and 14th of his career.	Samardzija gave up the lead in the second inning on Josh Rutledge's RBI single. After a two-out double by Darwin Barney, Samardzija got the lead back on a two-run shot to left to make it 3-1. It was Samardzija's first of the season and second of his career.	Yorvit Torrealba grounded into a double play to end the second inning which set off a string of 10 consecutive batters retired by Samardzija.	"He just used his whole repertoire tonight. He knew what he was doing tonight, he was pitching, he just wasn't out there throwing. He was mixing it up, keeping them a little off-balanced, broke a lot of bats again tonight," Cubs manager Dale Sveum said.	Samardzija bounced back from his worst outing of the season. He allowed a season-high eight hits and seven runs -- five earned -- in five innings of a 7-3 loss at Washington.	"Call me crazy, but I thought I did some good things in Washington. I thought I got back on track with my fastball. I just didn't pitch in enough against Washington, but overall when I looked back at the film I was happy with the way I threw. The outcome wasn't what you wanted but I knew I just had to carry that into tonight," Samardzija said.	In the sixth inning, Brignac led off with a pinch-hit home run to center. It was his first career pinch-hit homer and cut the Cubs lead to 3-2.	Samardzija got help from his defense in the seventh inning. With two outs, Rutledge lined a double off the wall in left field, Alfonso Soriano made a good relay throw to shortstop Starlin Castro, who was able to throw out Rutledge attempting a double.	The Rockies have not won back-to-back games since a season-high eight-game winning streak April 12-20. They have not won a three-game series at Wrigley Field since Sept. 29 to Oct. 1, 2006.	"We gotta put together some consistent performances. But overall, we've played fairly well on the road," Rockies manager Walt Weiss said.	In Samardzija's seven other starts, he endured a shaky bullpen and lack of timely hitting from his offense before getting his first win since April 1.	The Cubs added to the lead in the seventh. After a sacrifice bunt by Samardzija, Castro and Rizzo hit back-to-back RBI singles. Castro's hit came on a hit-and-run and Rizzo hit a hard grounder between the legs of Todd Helton at first base. Castro came around to score on Soriano's fielder's choice to make it 6-2.	In the ninth inning, Cubs closer Kevin Gregg gave up a two-out RBI single to Rutledge in a non-save situation. It was the first run he allowed in 11 appearances. He finished the game by getting Wilin Rosario to fly out to center with runners on first and third.	Game notes	Samardzija's other home run came on Sept. 23, 2009 at Milwaukee. ... RHP Jhoulys Chacin is Colorado's scheduled starter against San Francisco on Thursday. He is on a three-game losing streak against the Giants. ... The wave got going in the bottom of the seventh inning, an oddity at Wrigley Field. ... Rizzo has not struck out in his past 32 plate appearances, dating back to May 7th against the Cardinals.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

ST. LOUIS --  This time around, Shelby Miller battled for outs.	The St. Louis Cardinals rookie right-hander had trouble controlling his fastball, and finishing off hitters.	A pitch count headed for triple digits in the sixth inning was the only battle he lost.	The 22-year-old Miller followed up his nearly perfect one-hitter with 5 2/3 scoreless innings, and the Cardinals scored the go-ahead run in the seventh on a wild pitch in a 4-2 victory Wednesday night.	"It's not always going to be smooth," said Miller, who threw 96 pitches. "I got away with some mistakes. We won the game, so that's all that matters."	Rick Ankiel's two-run homer off rookie Seth Maness (3-0) tied it in the top of the seventh and was his first against the team that converted the former left-handed pitcher to an outfielder in 2005. Ankiel has 75 career homers, including six this year.	"It's unfortunate we didn't win but for me it's a positive, so I'm happy about it," Ankiel said. "For me it was just fun to do because it was against that team."	Shaun Marcum (0-4) made it out of the fifth for the first time in four starts since beginning the year on the 15-day disabled list and singled twice for his first career multihit game.	"I'm still not where I want to be," said Marcum, who visited a chiropractor in St. Louis the day before his start. "The important thing is the team, and we lost, so it doesn't matter what I did on the mound."	Marcum left the game with two on and two out in the seventh and Scott Rice's wild pitch to pinch hitter Ty Wigginton allowed Daniel Descalso to score the go-ahead run.	"Didn't even swing," said Wigginton, who ended up getting intentionally walked. "I just watched it slide by."	Jon Jay and Tony Cruz had an RBI apiece in the fourth and pinch hitter Yadier Molina added a pinch-hit RBI single in the eighth for the Cardinals, who have won 12 of 14 and handed the Mets their sixth straight loss.	St. Louis will go for a four-game sweep Thursday with ace Adam Wainwright (5-2, 2.30) facing Jonathon Niese  (2-4, 5.93).	Rice bounced a 1-0 pitch past catcher John Buck. The lefty took the loss his previous two appearances, including the series opener when Wigginton scored from second on Matt Carpenter's infield hit off Rice's leg.	Miller labored five days after retiring the final 27 batters with 13 strikeouts in a one-hitter over Colorado and as in some earlier starts had trouble finishing off hitters.	Buck coaxed a 12-pitch walk on a full count, fouling off six pitches after the count was 2-2.	"It's not like he's erratic and not efficient," manager Mike Matheny said. "He's challenging guys and they're getting a piece of it."	On Wednesday, he allowed four hits, a walk and a hit batter to lower his ERA to a major-league leading 1.40. Miller had three of his six strikeouts in the first when David Wright bounced a two-out single up the middle to end the streak at 29 in a row and then stole second before Ike Davis fanned to end the inning.	Marcum entered with an 8.59 ERA after getting a late start due to biceps tendinitis and has lost four consecutive decisions for the first time in his career. He retired the side in order on just eight pitches followed by a 10-pitch second, and retired 10 of the first 11 hitters.	Miller went to a full count for the fourth time in six hitters before walking Buck with one out in the second, and Ankiel fisted a bloop single to shallow center. But Buck ran the Mets out of the inning when he was easily doubled off second on Ruben Tejada's liner to center.	Cruz made just his second start of the season and first since April 19 at the backup catcher behind Molina, who was 0 for 11 the previous three games. Molina called Miller's gem on Friday, in which the 22-year-old right-hander allowed a leadoff single to Eric Young and then retired the final 27.	The Cardinals had one hit and one runner in scoring position the first three innings against Marcum before breaking through with three hits and a botched rundown play to take a 2-0 lead in the fourth.	The Mets allowed a run and cut off the relay after Jay's two-out RBI double to the gap in right-center. Jay was marooned between bases when Wright charged hard from third to make the tag and the ball bounced out of his glove.	Jay ended up at third and scored on a single by Cruz.	Edward Mujica worked the ninth for his 11th save.	Game notes	 Miller had a major-league best 1.39 ERA his first eight career starts, counting one in 2012, bettering Milo Candini's 1.09 ERA in 1943 for the Washington Senators. It's the Cardinals' best, topping Howie Pollet's 2.09 start in 1941. . ... Marlon Byrd homered and doubled Tuesday for his first multihit game since Aug. 7, 2011, with the Cubs against Cincinnati. ... Rookie John Gast was the first Cardinals' lefty starter to make his debut as a starter since Ankiel broke in at age 20 in August 1999 and the first to win in his debut since Allen Watson beat the Braves on July 8, 1993.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  After getting swept in a three-game series by the New York Yankees at the end of their homestand, the Kansas City Royals turned things around somewhat against the underachieving Los Angeles Angels.	Lorenzo Cain hit a three-run double and Billy Butler capped his most productive series of the season with a two-run single, leading the Royals to a 9-5 victory Wednesday night and helping them climb within 1½ games of AL Central-leading Detroit. They won two of three from the Halos to record their second winning series on the road.	"It was huge, because we struggled with the Yankees. So coming in here and taking two from these guys was big for us," Cain said. "Keeping those losing streaks down is definitely key throughout a long baseball season. So if we just continue to pitch the way we've been pitching and hit like we know how to hit, we'll be fine. Now we've got the momentum swing going, and hopefully we'll keep it going against Oakland."	Wade Davis (3-3) was charged with four runs and nine hits over 5 1/3 innings.	Butler, who entered this series in a 4-for-35 rut, went 8-for-13 with a homer and nine RBIs -- as many as he had in 103 at-bats over his previous 25 games. He was the top designated hitter in the league last season and won his first Silver Slugger Award with a .313 average, 29 homers and 107 RBIs.	"Billy doesn't stay down for long," manager Ned Yost said. "He had a great series, and once he heats up a little bit, he stays pretty consistent."	Barry Enright (0-2) gave up four runs, five hits and two walks in two-plus innings, leaving with the bases loaded and none out in the Royals' seven-run third.	"That's their decision. Obviously, it's not up to me," Enright said. "I felt I could have worked out of things, but they felt they were doing what's best for the team."	The right-hander threw 47 pitches before he was replaced by Mark Lowe, who gave up Butler's two-run single, followed by a walk to Eric Hosmer and Cain's bases-clearing double into the left-field corner.	"He was wild at first, so I definitely wanted to wait until he threw me a strike," Cain said. "On a 1-1 count, I was looking for that fastball up and he threw it right where I could do damage with it. I put a good swing on it and got it down the line."	Cain scored on a passed ball by Chris Iannetta after advancing on an infield hit by Elliot Johnson, and Jarrod Dyson capped the rally with an RBI triple to right-center. It was the Royals' most productive inning since Aug. 20, 2011, when they plated eight runs in the sixth.	"We're just trying to play good baseball and move in the right direction, and we feel like we did by winning the series," Butler said. "Tonight we made the pitcher come to us. We swung at the pitches we wanted to and we had good results."	The Angels started chipping away with an RBI single by Albert Pujols in the bottom of the third and a run-scoring single by Iannetta in the fourth, trimming the deficit to 8-2. They loaded the bases later that inning, but Davis retired Erick Aybar on an inning-ending double-play grounder after walking No.9 hitter J.B. Shuck.	The Halos got to the Royals' bullpen in the sixth and sliced Kansas City's lead to 8-4 with Alberto Callaspo's sacrifice fly and Aaron Crow's bases-loaded walk to Mike Trout. But Pujols followed with a rally-killing groundout to third base. The Angels ended up stranding 11 baserunners.	"We were swimming upstream from the beginning, but we kept firing on the offensive side," manager Mike Scioscia said. "I thought our at-bats were good, we took some walks when they were there. But we couldn't get the one big hit with runners in scoring position to get us back close and give us a chance to take a lead."	Trout made the final outcome a little more respectable with his eighth home run, a solo shot to center field in the eighth against hard-throwing right-hander Kelvin Herrera. Dyson scaled the thinly padded fence on a ball he had no chance to catch and sprained his right ankle, forcing him out of the game.	Mike Moustakas doubled with two out in the Royals' second, ending an 0-for-18 drought going back to his home run off the Yankees' Phil Hughes last Friday. Salvador Perez drove him in with a ground-rule double into the right field corner that barely eluded Josh Hamilton's diving attempt.	Game notes	 Fred White, who broadcast Royals games on radio for 25 seasons beginning in 1973 and remained with the organization in several capacities, died Wednesday in a hospice at age 76 due to complications from melanoma -- just one day after the club announced his retirement as director of broadcast services and the Royals Alumni. White was behind the mike at the "Big A" on Sept. 30, 1992, when George Brett got his 3,000th hit.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

LOS ANGELES -- Zack Greinke returned early from the disabled list, and the Los Angeles Dodgers' offense is starting to pick up.	The last-place Dodgers beat the Washington Nationals 3-1 on Wednesday night for their fourth win in five games.	Greinke pitched 5 1/3 strong innings in his first start since April 11 after coming off the disabled list earlier in the day. He was back three weeks sooner than expected from a broken left clavicle after a confrontation with San Diego's Carlos Quentin last month.	"It feels pretty good," he said. "I felt I was healing enough to pitch over two weeks ago. I just wasn't sharp enough. I'm not 100 percent, but it doesn't affect me at all."	The right-hander was expected to be out eight weeks. He underwent surgery April 13 to fix the injury with a metal plate used to stabilize the break.	"Definitely a boost to see him go out and pitch six innings and even drive in a run," said slugger Matt Kemp, who went 2-for-4 with two runs scored. "That was big for us. He looked pretty good."	Greinke (2-0) made one rehab appearance Friday for Class A Rancho Cucamonga, and the Dodgers decided he was ready to rejoin them.	He proved them right, allowing one run and five hits, striking out four, and walking none.	"Stuff was pretty good, just stamina needs to be a little bit stronger," Greinke said. "I was feeling pretty drained after the fifth."	Los Angeles went 10-19 while Greinke was out, but he didn't want credit for providing the team a lift.	"It takes everyone," he said. "Last time I got off the DL in Milwaukee, I was thinking that and trying too hard. This time I was just trying to do the job and not make anything of it."	Greinke helped himself with an RBI single with two outs in the second that extended the Dodgers' lead to 2-0.	"He'll get stronger and stronger as he goes," Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said. "It's pretty amazing what this guy has been able to do. It tells you about how talented he is. He worked his butt off while he was gone. He wanted to get back as soon as possible."	Brandon League pitched the ninth to earn his ninth save in 10 chances, helping the Dodgers close out the series 2-1 and giving them consecutive series victories for just the third time this season. They are 19-4 against the Nationals at home since the start of the 2006 season.	Los Angeles has held Washington to one run in the Nationals' past 22 innings of the series.	"We had the right guys up there," Nationals manager Davey Johnson said. "I don't know if they were trying to do too much instead of just hitting the ball and putting it in play. But we'll figure it out. We've got the guys to do it."	Adrian Gonzalez went 2-for-3 with a walk and a run scored. He is batting .460 with runners in scoring position. Andre Ethier went 2-for-2 with a run scored, too.	"A lot of good things happened," Mattingly said.	Ross Detwiler (2-4) gave up two runs and six hits in three innings before leaving because of lower-back spasms. The left-hander walked two and struck out none. The Nationals fell to 3-5 when he starts. Detwiler is 0-6 in six career road starts against NL West opponents.	"I don't feel that great now, but hopefully tomorrow morning I'll feel a lot better," he said. "It started spasming up and locked up. I couldn't get good extension to get the ball where I wanted to. The ball just wasn't coming out like it usually does."	Nationals star Bryce Harper returned as a pinch hitter in the ninth for the first time since cutting his chin and hurting his shoulder in a collision with the outfield wall Monday. He grounded out to first base.	The Dodgers took a 1-0 lead in the first on Gonzalez's RBI single up the middle with two outs. Kemp scored after extending his hitting streak to 14 games with a ground-rule double.	Ethier led off the second with a single. Scott Van Slyke walked, and then Juan Uribe hit into a double play. Greinke followed with a single to right field, his second hit of the season.	The Dodgers made it 3-1 in the eighth on a bases-loaded sacrifice fly by pinch hitter Carl Crawford.	Washington trailed 2-1 in the fourth on Adam LaRoche's homer that extended his 12-game hitting streak.	The Nats had the tying run at third base in the eighth. Steve Lombardozzi singled off Kenley Jansen to open the inning before being replaced by pinch runner Eury Perez. He took third on Ryan Zimmerman's single that dropped in shallow right field. Jansen then retired three consecutive batters to end the inning.	"He throws three or four different pitches, he doesn't miss over the middle too much and he did a good job," Zimmerman said about Greinke.	Game notes	The Dodgers became the first major league team to top 1 million in attendance this season, doing so in 24 home games. The team is averaging 42,707, which leads the majors. ... Nationals C Wilson Ramos left the game after he singled in the fourth, having reinjured his left hamstring. ... Detwiler walked Van Slyke in the second, snapping a streak of 20 consecutive innings without a walk issued by the Nationals staff. ... The Nats have hit at least one home run in 69 consecutive series dating to Sept. 12-15, 2011. ... Since Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw threw 132 pitches in a 2-0 win Tuesday, he will be moved back a day and will pitch Monday in Milwaukee. RHP Matt Magill will start Sunday in Atlanta.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

ST. LOUIS -- To compensate for early exits, Jonathan Niese did some extra throwing in his bullpen session. Besides the work, manager Terry Collins thought it was no coincidence the lefty rediscovered his groove in shirt-sleeve weather and paved the way for the New York Mets' slump-buster.	"I knew he was going to get it going," Collins said after Niese's bounce-back game on a clear, sunny, 76-degree day helped the Mets end their losing streak at six with a 5-2 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals on Thursday. "As the weather starts to get warm, you're going to see the Jon Niese we're all accustomed to seeing."	Daniel Murphy and David Wright combined for five hits and three RBIs against Adam Wainwright.	Niese (3-4) allowed two runs on six hits in 7 1/3 innings, his longest outing of the season. He ended his four-game losing streak over five starts since a win at Minnesota on April 12.	"Every pitch felt good," Niese said. "Obviously, our game plan was just to keep attacking the hitters. Yeah, it felt good."	The Mets avoided a four-game sweep by getting to the Cardinals ace. Wainwright (5-3) was coming off a two-hit shutout in which he no-hit the Rockies for 7 1/3 innings.	"They had a great frame of mind," Collins said. "I thought they had great energy. Jon pitching well really helped us, too."	Murphy went 4 for 4 to match his career high, doubled twice and walked and totaled 10 hits in the series. He's 6 for 9 against Wainwright, and swinging well enough that Collins has thought about moving him from the second slot to fifth for RBI potential.	"I think we were just able to string together a lot of quality at-bats," Murphy said. "There were a lot of good at-bats other than mine. It was nice to be able to feel you contribute."	Wright doubled, singled and drove in two runs, plus started two double plays at third base against cleanup man Allen Craig.	"That's the name of the game sometimes," Craig said. "You hit it hard and it goes right at them."	The Cardinals have never swept the Mets in a four-game series at home, almost always playing three-game sets.	Pete Kozma and Carlos Beltran had an RBI apiece for the Cardinals, who lost for just the third time in 15 games.	Wainwright faltered after allowing one hit with four strikeouts the first time through the order, but after his outing ended at 87 pitches he confessed, "Yeah, I was surprised." He allowed three earned runs in six innings, and is 1-4 with a 7.29 ERA against the Mets for his career.	"I made a couple of mistakes over the middle of the plate," Wainwright said. "I don't think it's time to start talking about fatigue or anything like that."	Niese had permitted 15 runs in 8 1/3 innings in his previous two starts, but kept the Cardinals off-balance.	Niese is 3-1 in five starts against the Cardinals. He had three strikeouts and two walks to make him even on the year with 24 strikeouts and walks.	Bobby Parnell finished for his fourth save in six chances.	Newly signed Mets center fielder Rick Ankiel appeared to get a late jump on Kozma's apparent routine fly ball and couldn't make a diving catch for an RBI double that put the Cardinals in front in the second.	Jordany Valdespin beat out a bunt with two outs in the Mets' third and scored on a headfirst slide on Murphy's double. Wright's single put the Mets ahead.	Murphy and Wright doubled to start the sixth to give Niese a two-run cushion. Wright later scored on Lucas Duda's sacrifice fly.	Murphy leads the Mets with 13 multi-hit games and is a career .360 hitter against the Cardinals.	Ankiel was credited with a ground-rule double leading off the seventh on a ball down the third-base line that appeared to glance off an usher's leg before hitting a railing. He was thrown out at second off the carom, and replays showed the usher barely made it out of the way.	Game notes	The Mets' Matt Harvey (4-0, 1.44) opposes Edwin Jackson (1-5, 6.02) and to start a three-game series in Chicago Friday while Jaime Garcia (4-2, 2.88) opposes Wily Peralta (3-3, 5.40) to begin a three-game series against the Brewers. ... Mets 1B Ike Davis struck out four times while struggling against breaking balls and was 0 for-5. ... 1B umpire Tim Timmons missed a half-inning early in the game, returning before the bottom of the fourth. No reason was given for the absence. ... Since 2000, the Mets are 16-31 against the Cardinals in St. Louis. ... Mets starters had been 1-7 with a 5.72 ERA the previous 13 games. ... Seth Maness, who got the win Wednesday after allowing Ankiel's tying two-run homer in the seventh, is the Cardinals' only player since 1900 to earn three victories in relief in his first five career appearances. Jason Simontacchi won his first three relief appearances in 2003 after beginning his career in the rotation.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

NEW YORK -- For the New York Yankees, MRI has become a statistic that's just as important as ERA and RBIs.	Andy Pettitte trudged off in the fifth inning with a back injury.	Chris Stewart limped off after seven with an injured leg.	A 3-2 loss to the Seattle Mariners on Thursday night seemed more significant than just another defeat.	Twelve Yankees already have been on the disabled list this year, costing a total of 332 games. While they lead the AL East at 25-16, how many more injuries can they withstand?	"I think everybody else out of this room probably already felt we passed that point," said Brett Gardner, stranded on third base when Robinson Cano hit a game-ending groundout.	Seeking his 250th win, Pettitte started feeling uncomfortable in the fourth inning, when Seattle took a 2-1 lead on an infield single by Brendan Ryan, who had been in a 5-for-60 slide.	"When I came off in the fourth, it just completely locked up and I got the trainer to give me a little massage down here with some heat, and it loosened up and loosened up really good," Pettitte said.	It lasted only until his first pitch of the fifth, to Jason Bay.	"It completely locked back up on me," Pettitte said. "I couldn't get extended at all. I really just felt like I was kind of cutting everything off and really just trying to throw it in there, just almost slower than slow to tell you the truth."	Pettitte struck out Bay and Kyle Seager. By then, Yankees manager Joe Girardi and pitching coach Larry Rothschild noticed Pettitte's velocity had dropped, and they went to the mound and took him out.	"He is 40 years old, and we're probably going to go through this probably a little bit," Girardi said.	Pettitte missed a start in April because of lower back spasms. This was diagnosed as a tight left trapezius muscle, near his pitching shoulder. It was too soon to determine whether he would miss his next turn.	"There's no doubt I'm getting old. But I don't want to sit there and tell you that that's the exact reason why," Pettitte said. "I look around the league and I see all kind of people on the DL with all kind of problems that are a lot younger than me, too."	Stewart pulled up at third base in the seventh on Cano's infield single, which drew the Yankees within a run. He stayed in for Vernon Wells' inning-ending popout, then was sent for an MRI of his left groin.	"He felt something," Girardi said. "He said it didn't pop."	Stewart, who took over as the Yankees' starting catcher when Francisco Cervelli broke a hand last month, was replaced by Austin Romine. New York doesn't have any other available catchers on its 40-man roster and would have to clear a spot for Bobby Wilson, who has been starting at Triple-A.	"Injuries are a part of the game, and some years you're going to have more than others," Girardi said. "And right now we have a few."	Pettitte (4-3) allowed two runs, four hits and three walks in 4 2/3 innings with five strikeouts, struggling again with his command. In the fourth, he ran into foul territory on the third base side to make a basket catch on Raul Ibanez's low popup but said that didn't figure into his back problem.	Seattle had injury issues, too.	Aaron Harang, Seattle's scheduled starter, felt a twinge in his back Wednesday and notified the Mariners, who in turn told Hector Noesi to prepare for his first big league start of the season.	A 26-year-old right-hander, Noesi was acquired by the Mariners from the Yankees in January 2012 in the trade that sent promising pitcher Michael Pineda to New York and made four relief appearances for Seattle this year. He gave up an unearned run and three hits in 4 1/3 innings, leaving with two on.	Lefty Oliver Perez (1-0), his career revived in Seattle, entered with runners at the corners and struck out Gardner and retired Jayson Nix on a popup.	Seattle also got runs on Dustin Ackley's RBI double in the second and Michael Morse's sixth-inning homer off former Mariners pitcher Shawn Kelley, a drive that bounced off the divider between Monument Park and the Yankees bullpen in right-center for his 10th homer this season.	Granderson singled in the second and scored when David Adams doubled for his first big league RBI. In his third game back from a broken arm, Granderson made his third career start at DH and had three hits. He doubled in the eighth but Carter Capps retired rookie David Adams on a popup and struck out Ichiro Suzuki, who one inning earlier singled to stop an 0-for-22 slide.	Tom Wilhelmsen finished to remain perfect in 11 save chances. He allowed a one-out single to Gardner, who stole second and third. He struck out Nix -- leaving right-handed batters 0 for 30 against him this year -- then retired Cano on a groundout to shortstop.	"What can you say? Nobody's going to feel sorry us," Gardner related. "We can't take the day off tomorrow."	Girardi said SS Derek Jeter (broken ankle) should be out of a walking boot soon. ... RHP Joba Chamberlain (strained oblique) will need at least one more minor league rehab outing before the Yankees activate him from the DL. ... New York 1B Mark Teixeira (wrist) hit several long homers on curveballs off a pitching machine at the Yankees' minor league complex in Tampa, Fla. 3B Alex Rodriguez, coming back from hip surgery in January, is hitting off a tee and swinging at soft toss flips in a batting cage as he wraps up his second week of baseball activities. ... Travis Hafner (sore right shoulder) took batting practice and hopes to be able to play Friday. ... The Yankees optioned RHP Brett Marshall back to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre and recalled RHP Dellin Betances from the Triple-A team.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PITTSBURGH --  The ball left Travis Snider's bat and he took off with his head down. The Pittsburgh Pirates outfielder had imagined driving the ball into the Allegheny River since he joined the team last summer.	In Snider's daydreams, the homer always went down the right field line, the shortest route out of PNC Park.	Reality turned out to be even sweeter. And longer.	Snider's 458-foot longball over the bushes in right-center propelled the Pirates to a 7-1 win over the Milwaukee Brewers on Thursday night. The two-run shot was Snider's first homer since last August, an eternity for a guy once considered a power-hitting prospect.	That's why he didn't look up. Snider thought he had homered earlier in the season and flipped his bat in celebration only to end up with a double. Not this time. He sprinted around the bases without so much as peeking from under his cap to see where the ball landed.	"For me it's not how far it goes," Snider said. "It's just about getting it over the fence. It's been a struggle, a long nine months or so."	Snider finished 3 for 5 with three RBIs, including the 31st homer to end up in the river in the 12-year history of the ballpark. Andrew McCutchen, Starling Marte, Garrett Jones and Russell Martin all had two hits as Pittsburgh won for the sixth time in seven games.	Francisco Liriano (2-0) allowed one run on six hits over 5 2/3 innings, striking out seven and walking three. The veteran left-hander reached 96 mph with his fastball and overcame a sloppy first inning before settling down.	"I just try to stay calm, not try to do too much, hit my spot and just focus on location," Liriano said. "Pitching is all about location. I'm locating my fastball a lot better and my slider is working for me so far."	Burgos gave up three runs in five innings but Milwaukee's offense sputtered. The Brewers have lost 11 of 13.	"I know we're going to be fine," Milwaukee center fielder Carlos Gomez said. "This is a problem that can be fixed because we have good players. It's tough now, though. It's embarrassing. We have a lot of expectations on this team and we're not playing up to them."	The Pirates sure are. Pittsburgh moved to 24-17 with the win, matching the franchise's best start through the first quarter of the season in 21 years. The 1992 Pirates also began the season 24-17 and finished with 96 victories while capturing the NL East. It's also the last time Pittsburgh finished the season with a winning record.	"We're in a good place right now," Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said.	The romp capped a dramatic turnaround in one of baseball's most lopsided rivalries. Milwaukee has dominated the Pirates over the last six years, coming into the series 71-25 against Pittsburgh since 2007.	Milwaukee won the opener on Monday before the Pirates responded with a 4-3 win on Tuesday in 12 innings. A 3-1 victory followed on Wednesday before Thursday's rout, the first time the Pirates have won three straight against the Brewers in the same series since Aug. 16-18, 2009.	Liriano, who signed a two-year free agent contract in the offseason, sparkled in his home debut. The veteran left-hander missed the season's first six weeks while recovering from a broken right arm. He sailed through his first start, an 11-2 win over the New York Mets last Saturday.	Things were a little tighter this time around. The Brewers pushed a run across in the first on an RBI single by Jonathan Lucroy, an inning that could have been bigger if leadoff hitter Norichika Aoki hadn't been gunned down trying to steal second after a leadoff walk and McCutchen didn't rob Ryan Braun of extra bases with a leaping grab at the wall in center.	The veteran left-hander seemed to settle down immediately. He struck out four straight batters at one point and worked out of a trouble spot in the fifth when Lucroy flied out to left with two on to preserve a 1-all game.	Snider broke the tie in the bottom of the inning. Marte led off with an infield hit then Snider crushed an 85 mph fastball.	"I threw a fastball up and down the middle of the plate and he put a good swing on it," Burgos said.	Burgos gave up three runs on eight hits with a walk and three strikeouts, and he remains winless since winning his major league debut against the Chicago Cubs on April 20.	Milwaukee had a chance in the sixth after Clint Barmes bobbled a potential double-play ball at shortstop. Reliever Justin Wilson came on with two outs and retired pinch-hitter Aramis Ramirez on a fly to left with two on to preserve the lead for Liriano.	The Pirates broke it open in the sixth off reliever Alfredo Figaro, ripping off five straight hits to score four runs and give the bullpen plenty of cushion on a night closer Jason Grilli was not available after being given the day off by Hurdle.	Game notes	 Four-time All-Star reliever Francisco Rodriguez, called up from Triple-A Nashville early Thursday, struck out one batter during his perfect inning of work ... Pittsburgh RHP Charlie Morton, who is recovering from Tommy John surgery, pitched four innings in a rehab start at Double-A Altoona on Thursday. Morton gave up two runs on two hits with one walk and one strikeout. His next start will come at Triple-A Indianapolis next week ... The Pirates open a three-game series with Houston on Friday. Jeanmar Gomez (2-0, 2.28 ERA) starts for the Pirates against Houston's Jordan Lyles (1-1, 8.36) ... Milwaukee travels to St. Louis Friday. Wily Peralta (3-3, 5.40) faces Jaime Garcia (4-2, 2.88).	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

MIAMI --  On the verge of a second successive series sweep, the Cincinnati Reds encountered a ninth-inning blip.	First Mat Latos gave up a triple, ending his bid for a complete game. Then closer Aroldis Chapman gave up another triple, sending the game into extra innings.	But the Reds bounced back in the 10th, scoring three times to complete their second three-game sweep in a row by beating the Miami Marlins 5-3 Thursday night.	NL RBI leader Brandon Phillips homered in the sixth inning and drove in the go-ahead run with a sacrifice fly in the 10th.	"We wanted to win the game in nine," Phillips said. "We could have just put our heads down, but we went with the flow."	Latos and two relievers combined on a six-hitter. After Chapman (3-1) blew a save for the first time in nine chances, J.J. Hoover gave up a run in the 10th but earned his third save.	Pinch-hitter Donald Lutz led off the 10th with a single against Steve Cishek (1-4). Following a walk, a bunt and an intentional walk, Phillips lifted a flyball for his second RBI of the night and 36th of the season.	Jay Bruce followed with a two-run double and finished with three RBIs.	The Marlins trailed 2-1 when Adeiny Hechavarria tripled with one out in the ninth, ending Latos' night.	"I really wanted to finish it," Latos said. "But we got a W, and that's all that matters."	Chapman came on to strike out pinch-hitter Placido Polanco on a 100 mph fastball, but rookie Marcell Ozuna connected with a 98 mph fastball for an RBI triple.	Chapman then struck out pinch-hitter Justin Ruggiano to send the game into extra innings.	"We thought we were out of it. Then they tied the game up," Reds manager Dusty Baker said. "You've got to come back and keep fighting. You have no choice."	Juan Pierre led off Miami's first with his first homer since June 23. Latos dominated after that, throwing only 91 pitches in 8 1/3 innings.	The right-hander's streak of wins in four consecutive starts ended even though he allowed just four hits and two runs.	"Latos was dealing," Baker said. "That's as pitch-efficient as I've seen anybody."	The young Marlins, who have the NL's worst record, lost their fifth consecutive game and were swept for the fourth time this year. They rank last in the majors in runs and totaled five in the series.	"I was trying to throw the ball right down the middle," Latos said. "It's a big ballpark, and I tried to let those guys get themselves out. A lot of them swing early and often."	Miami rookie Jose Fernandez allowed two runs in seven innings and threw a career-high 99 pitches. The Marlins have scored 23 runs in his eight starts.	The Reds swept a series in Miami for the first time since 2004. They've won a season-best six in a row to climb nine games above .500 for the first time.	Latos preserved a 2-1 lead when he pitched out of a bases-loaded, one-out jam in the seventh. Jeff Mathis, playing in his first game this year after coming off the disabled list, bounced into a 5-2-3 double play.	"I'm happy with the way we battled," manager Mike Redmond said. "We used almost all our guys, we bunted, we tried everything to score some runs and still we came up short."	The game was the finale this season between the two teams. Cincinnati went 6-1 against the Marlins, outscoring them 40-16.	The Marlins fell to 0-11 with the retractable roof open in their ballpark. They're 5-3 with the roof closed.	Pierre began the game with a slugging percentage of .278, but he needed only one swing in the first to put Miami ahead. He let out a whoop when his homer barely cleared the fence just inside the right field foul pole.	"Juan Pierre hit a home run off me -- just my luck," Latos said. "I looked at him when he was running the bases and said, `What the heck happened?"	Pierre also robbed the Reds of two extra-base hits in left field. He made a diving catch of Joey Votto's drive to the warning track in the first, and made a diving, backhanded grab of Todd Frazier's fly in the sixth.	Cincinnati made it 1-all in the fourth when Bruce's two-out single scored Votto, who had doubled. Phillips sent a 95-mph fastball over the fence with two out in the sixth to put the Reds up 2-1.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  The Boston Red Sox were down to their last strike when Will Middlebrooks made the most of a mistake.	Middlebrooks had a three-run double off closer Fernando Rodney with two outs in the ninth inning that lifted the Red Sox past the Tampa Bay Rays 4-3 on Thursday night.	"He hung me a changeup and normally he buries that pitch, and he left it up," Middlebrooks said.	Middlebrooks lined a shot to left on a 1-2 pitch from Rodney (1-2) with the base loaded, giving the Red Sox the lead. Rodney, who blew just two saves last year, is 7 for 10 in save opportunities this year.	"This game is difficult," Rodney said. "Sometimes when you think you've got it in your hands, it's gone. That's how I'm feeling tonight. Sometimes you lose control for a little bit, and you can find your way back to finish that inning."	After walking Dustin Pedroia and David Ortiz, Rodney struck out Mike Napoli before loading the bases with a walk to Daniel Nava. Stephen Drew struck out, but Middlebrooks then came up with his bases-clearing hit.	"The approach by everybody in the ninth inning ... we took some close pitches," Boston manager John Farrell said. "We load the bases via the walk. Even though we're going up against a guy that's got tremendous stuff, there was no give up, there was not letdown."	Rodney finished with four walks, which is a career high.	Junichi Tazawa (3-2) pitched two scoreless innings for the win. He retired James Loney on a grounder with two on and two outs in the ninth.	The Red Sox had been 0-12 when trailing after eight innings.	"Awesome ... get us some momentum," Middlebrooks said.	Felix Doubront gave up two runs, three hits, six walks and had seven strikeouts over five-plus innings for the Red Sox, who are 6-9 in May. He threw 104 pitches, including 54 strikes.	Doubront pitched once in relief since his last start May 3 as the Red Sox have worked on the left-hander's delivery. His 1-0 pitch in the third to Luke Scott slipped out his hand and ended up in foul territory between home and first.	"I felt a lot better," Doubront said.	Tampa Bay's Alex Cobb allowed one run and three hits over 6 1/3 innings. He struck out six and walked two.	Cobb struck out 13 in 4 2/3 innings last Friday night against San Diego, becoming the first pitcher in major league history to fan that many batters and fail to make it through the fifth inning.	The Rays went up 3-1 in the sixth on RBI singles by Desmond Jennings and Scott.	Before the game, Tampa Bay put AL Cy Young Award winner David Price on the 15-day disabled list with a left triceps strain and recalled left-hander Alex Torres from Triple-A Durham. The Rays are hopeful that Price, who departed in the third inning of Wednesday night's game against Boston, will only miss two or three starts.	Doubront was pulled after walking Loney to start the sixth. Clayton Mortensen entered, got an out before issuing a pair of walks to load the bases. Desmond Jennings then singled to put Tampa Bay up 2-1.	Andrew Miller replaced Mortensen and allowed Scott's run-scoring single that made it 3-1.	Ryan Roberts gave the Rays a 1-0 advantage on his homer in the second.	Cobb retired his first 10 batters, including four on strikeouts, before Shane Victorino doubled down the right field line with one out in the fourth. Victorino scored to tie it at 1 on Ortiz's two-out single.	Victorino left after the eighth with lower back tightness.	"We'll check him tomorrow," Farrell said. "He's a little banged up right now."	Ortiz has 69 RBIs at Tropicana Field, which ranks second behind Manny Ramirez's 72 for the most by a visiting player.	Game notes	 Boston closer Andrew Bailey (right biceps strain) had a 15-pitch simulated game. The right-hander will make a minor league rehab appearance Saturday for Triple-A Pawtucket and could be activated from the 15-day disabled list on Monday. ... Red Sox RHP Joel Hanrahan, who had been the closer, had right elbow ligament replacement surgery and had his right flexor tendon repaired by Dr. James Andrews in Pensacola, Fla. .... Rays manager Joe Maddon said a decision has yet to be made on who will make Price's next scheduled start Monday in Toronto. Among the options are right-hander's Jake Odorizzi and Chris Archer, as well as Torres, who made his major league debut in 2011, when he appeared in four games -- all in relief. ... Farrell said the team has not discussed moving struggling RHP Daniel Bard from Double-A Portland to extended spring training. Bard walked five and threw just 8 of 30 pitches for strikes in one-plus inning for Portland Wednesday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Justin Verlander flopped in his Texas showdown with Yu Darvish. The Japanese star was about to do the same until he settled down after the pitching duel fizzled.	Geovany Soto ended Verlander's night with a three-run homer that capped a seven-run third, and Darvish needed a career-high 130 pitches to get through eight innings in the Texas Rangers' 10-4 win over the Detroit Tigers on Thursday.	Darvish gave up a home run to Jhonny Peralta, the first batter he faced after the Texas outburst that sent a shell-shocked Verlander to the Detroit dugout in his shortest outing in nearly three years. The drive made it three straight games with two homers allowed for Darvish, and pulled Detroit to 8-4.	Then the right-hander retired 15 of the final 16 Tigers he faced, including 10 straight.	"The thing about Yu Darvish, he bends but he never breaks," Rangers manager Ron Washington said. "That's a tremendous lineup he went through. After that third inning, he settled in and found something that was working and he continued to pitch."	Soto's drive just over the wall in left field came after Verlander walked in two runs -- he had three previous bases-loaded walks in his career. Mitch Moreland's two-out double broke a 3-all tie before Soto's drive put Texas ahead 8-3.	"It wasn't much of a night to begin with but I'd definitely say the whole game kind of carry-over from my last start," said Verlander, who was coming off his worst outing of the year in a loss to Cleveland. "I'm not somebody who is going to go home and pout about this, I'm somebody who is going to figure it out and figure it out in a hurry."	Darvish (7-1) won his fifth straight decision despite allowing two home runs for the third start in a row. Baseball's strikeout leader matched his season low with six strikeouts, and didn't get the last one until Washington decided to bring him back out for the eighth even though he'd already thrown 115 pitches.	"Wash asked me if I could go longer and he seemed like he wanted to go a little bit longer," Darvish said. "And I felt really good so I wanted to go. The bullpen guys were pretty used up in that last series so I wanted to go."	Verlander (4-4) gave up six hits with two walks and three strikeouts in 2 2/3 innings, his shortest outing since going two innings in a 14-6 loss to the New York Mets on June 22, 2010.	The 2011 AL MVP and Cy Young winner had allowed just four earned runs in four previous starts at Rangers Ballpark. It was actually the second time in Verlander's last 16 starts dating to last season that he's allowed eight runs, his career high. He did it in a 9-8 loss to Kansas City last August.	"It was one of those where I think everybody in the world was looking for the matchup and it didn't turn out too good," Detroit manager Jim Leyland said. "Those two guys out there and there were 12 runs scored -- I don't think anybody expected that. We probably let down the audience a little bit."	Two nights after hitting two home runs in Oakland, Moreland had two doubles and three RBIs and pushed his batting average to .296 less than a month after he was hitting .157.	Darvish ran into trouble first when five of the first six Detroit hitters in the third inning reached, starting with Don Kelly's first home run of the season into the lower porch in right field. Torii Hunter and Victor Martinez had sacrifice flies to put the Tigers ahead 3-1.	Verlander, the AL's strikeout leader the past two years, gave up consecutive singles to start the first and third innings. The Rangers scored just once in the first, but the right-hander couldn't survive the third once his control escaped him.	After Verlander hit Ian Kinsler with a curveball to loaded the bases, Elvis Andrus walked to score a run before Lance Berkman struck out on check swing on a pitch so high it bounced off the bricks behind home plate and came straight back to the catcher Kelly. Adrian Beltre walked to tie the score, and the hits from Moreland and Soto came after one of three strikeouts by Nelson Cruz, who hit his 11th homer.	Between them, Verlander and Darvish threw 74 pitches in the third inning and allowed 12 base runners and 10 runs. It wasn't quite the duel fans expected in Arlington's most anticipated pitching matchup since Nolan Ryan beat Roger Clemens 2-1 in 1989.	"They both had a bad third inning," Leyland said. "Justin was just quite worse than his but his wasn't too good either. We really grinded out our at-bats and they did, too. That's one thing this club does and that's one thing we do, too."	Game notes	 The Rangers landed in Texas about 1:30 a.m. Thursday, following an afternoon game in Oakland after their charter flight was diverted to Albuquerque, N.M., because of severe storms in the Dallas area. At least six people died after tornadoes struck Granbury, about 50 miles southwest of Arlington. ... The Tigers sent RHP Al Alburquerque to Triple-A Toledo to work out issues with his control. He has 26 strikeouts in 14 1/3 innings, but has walked 13 and thrown six wild pitches. RHP Evan Reed was called up and made his major league debut in the sixth. ... Rangers C A.J. Pierzynski (strained oblique) took batting practice Thursday and could go on a short rehab assignment starting Sunday. He's eligible to come off the disabled list Tuesday. ... Kinsler tied the Rangers record held by Rafael Palmeiro with his 54th hit by pitch when Verlander plunked him on the shoulder with a curveball.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DENVER -- Matt Cain didn't hang his head even after hanging a few pitches to give Colorado a big early lead.	He simply figured that there was plenty of time to get back into the game. After all, this is Coors Field, where no lead is safe.	Cain was correct.	The right-hander settled down after a bumpy beginning, Angel Pagan hit a tiebreaking two-run single in the sixth inning and the San Francisco Giants won their 10th straight over Colorado, rallying from a six-run deficit to beat the Rockies 8-6 on Thursday night.	"What a great comeback," manager Bruce Bochy said. "For the third game in a row, we dug ourselves a pretty good hole there."	Only this time, they were able to recover. That wasn't the case during a two-game series in Toronto, when the Giants were outscored 21-9.	Cain didn't travel with the team to Canada, instead arriving in Denver early. All he could think about was not putting his team in a bad predicament.	And that's precisely what he did.	Cain (3-2) struggled early, giving up homers on consecutive pitches to Todd Helton and Nolan Arenado in the second, along with a three-run homer to Wilin Rosario an inning later.	After that, Cain found his rhythm before being pulled with an out in the seventh. In 6 1/3 innings, he gave up nine hits but still moved to 3-0 this month.	"Playing in this ballpark, there are some runs out there," Cain said. "That's not always a fun thing, but it's something you always know. Runs can come in bunches here."	Jeremy Affeldt held the Rockies hitless in two innings of relief work before handing the ball to closer Sergio Romo, who got two outs to earn his 13th save in 15 chances. The Rockies only had one hit after Rosario's home run.	"When you get six early off a guy like Cain you've got to be able to put him away," Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. "You've got a guy who's one of the better pitchers in the league; you've got to get to him early. You've got to be able to put him away and not hang around."	Brandon Crawford added a three-run double to help San Francisco and Marco Scutaro extended his hitting streak to 15 games. The NL West-leading Giants also extended their mastery over the Rockies, improving to 31-9 since 2011.	Jhoulys Chacin (3-3) was the reverse of Cain -- solid early before falling apart. He yielded a season-high eight runs in 5 1/3 innings to a powerful Giants lineup that came into the game hitting an NL-best .267.	With this performance, Chacin's ERA soared from 2.70 to 4.07.	"Cain pitched terrible, but Chacin pitched even worse," Carlos Gonzalez said. "Just a bad game for him. Those guys are really good pitchers. We were able to score six runs, and then Chacin, who's always a pitcher that gives us a chance to win -- it just didn't happen tonight. It was just a bad game."	Trailing by six, the Giants climbed back into the game with a five-run fourth inning. Brandon Belt brought in a run with a walk, with Crawford later adding a bases-clearing double. Cain also got into the scoring act, driving in Crawford with a single. It was Cain's second RBI of the season.	Gregor Blanco tied the game in the sixth with a sacrifice fly to center. Pagan, the leadoff hitter, gave the Giants an 8-6 lead with a two-out, two-run single over the head of reliever Adam Ottavino, who was brought in for Chacin.	The bottom of the Giants' lineup certainly came through, driving in six runs.	"We're awesome," said Belt, the No. 6 hitter. "We got down early, but there was a lot of game left. We don't give up. It worked for us tonight."	Cain wrestled with his command early. He gave up three runs each in the second and third innings. Cain allowed back-to-back homers to Helton and Arenado. Helton stood at home plate to watch his two-run homer -- not so much to admire his handiwork as see if it would curve foul. It didn't and he trotted around the bases.	On the next offering from Cain, Arenado lined a 91 mph fastball into the seats in left-center.	Rosario had the big blow in the third, hitting a three-run homer to right.	Still, Cain kept his composure on the mound.	"He didn't seem like he was starting to get angry," Belt said. "It seemed like he was bearing down even more. It showed from there. ... He did awesome."	Bochy said the plan remains to pitch struggling RHP Ryan Vogelsong on Monday. "I talked to Vogey for quite a while and he said, 'Hey, if you need me in the pen the next couple of days I'm available,'" Bochy said. "He's earned some things, including a longer leash. That's something he's earned." ... Arenado made a diving grab at third in the eighth to throw out INF Brett Pill. ... Before the game, Colorado juggled its roster by placing LHP Jeff Francis (groin) on the 15-day disabled and designated INF Reid Brignac for assignment. The team also recalled INF D.J. LeMahieu and RHP Rob Scahill from Triple-A Colorado Springs.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Timing is everything for a hitter, even when he doesn't make contact.	Jeff Keppinger walked with the bases loaded to drive in the go-ahead run -- his first base on balls in 141 plate appearances this season -- and the Chicago White Sox rallied with three runs in the eighth to beat the Los Angeles Angels 5-4 on Thursday night for their season-high third straight road win.	"It was a good time to get one," Keppinger said. "We're sitting at the bottom of the division, so any win we can get now moves us up."	The Angels aren't quite that low -- they've got last-place Houston beat in the AL West -- but they continued to stumble. Their bullpen wasted a two-run lead as the club lost its second straight and dropped to 8-12 at home.	"You've got to start a streak somewhere, and we're going to have to do something pretty special to get back into it," Mark Trumbo said. "If you let enough of them slide, you're not going to be able to do that."	Matt Lindstrom (2-2) got the victory after facing one batter in the seventh, getting Mike Trout to fly out to right to end the inning.	Addison Reed pitched the ninth to earn his 13th save in 14 chances.	"That's how we've been playing and we're going to continue to play -- never giving up no matter what the score is," Reed said. "Our offense was awesome."	Dane De La Rosa (1-1) took the loss, giving up all three runs in the eighth.	He had pitched two perfect innings with three strikeouts against the White Sox last Friday. The walk was the third in a row issued by Michael Kohn, who threw 12 of his final 14 pitches out of the strike zone.	"It seemed like their guy just lost it there," Keppinger said.	Kohn called it an off-night.	"My job is to come in and keep those guys on base. Unfortunately, I didn't do that," he said. "Obviously, you want to be down in the zone. But when I'm up like that, it's probably spinning off my hand too much because I'm trying to do too much. The old saying is less is more."	Chicago closed to 4-3 after Alejandro De Aza scored when De La Rosa threw a wild pitch on a strikeout by Alex Rios. Alexei Ramirez tied the game 4-all on a single by Adam Dunn.	All seven of the games between the two teams are taking place in a span of 10 days. The series is tied 2-2, with three more in Anaheim.	"I don't know if you're necessarily rooting for that, but it was at a good time for us," Chicago manager Robin Ventura said about the third walk. "I just like the way the offense battles."	Howie Kendrick gave the Angels a 4-2 lead when he doubled to deep left-center in the sixth, scoring Trumbo, who walked, and Josh Hamilton, who singled to right. White Sox left fielder Dayan Viciedo scrambled to track the ball over his shoulder, but he misplayed it and Hamilton easily beat the throw to the plate.	Chicago tied the game at 2 in the fifth when Conor Gillaspie doubled to lead off, took third on a groundout and scored when Keppinger was safe at first on shortstop Erick Aybar's fielding error with the infield in.	The Angels took a 2-1 lead in the fourth when Albert Pujols homered on the first pitch into the right field seats, scoring Trout, who was issued a leadoff walk by Jose Quintana.	Chicago led 1-0 in the fourth on a towering homer by Rios with two outs, extending his hitting streak to a season-high 11 games. The ball just cleared both bullpens in left field and landed in the first few rows of seats.	Angels starter Jerome Williams allowed two runs and five hits in six-plus innings, struck out three and walked none.	Making his second straight start against the Angels, Quintana gave up four runs and six hits in 6 2/3 innings, struck out four and walked three.	Game notes	 Two key Angels relievers took significant steps in their return from injury on Thursday. RHP Kevin Jepsen (shoulder strain, out since April 12) and LHP Sean Burnett (forearm irritation, out since April 27) both threw full-intensity bullpen workouts. Jepsen expects to begin a minor league stint of one or two games this weekend, putting him in line to return late next week. Manager Mike Scioscia said Burnett will probably need one minor league game before being activated, perhaps by Tuesday. ... The Angels recalled RHP Ryan Brasier from Triple-A Salt Lake and selected the contract of RHP Billy Buckner from Salt Lake, making him the 21st pitcher the team has used this season. The club optioned LHP Michael Roth to Double-A Arkansas and designated RHP Barry Enright for assignment.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN DIEGO --  Stephen Strasburg had quite the homecoming.	Pitching in front of about 50 family members and friends, Strasburg lasted a career-high eight innings against his hometown Padres to snap a seven-start winless streak, and Bryce Harper and Adam LaRoche homered to lead the Washington Nationals to a 6-2 victory against San Diego on Thursday night.	"It's easy pitching in front of a lot of loved ones," Strasburg said. "It's just another place to me, to be honest. It's my hometown. I'm an Aztec. But I look forward to pitching anyplace in the big leagues. It's kind of a dream come true."	Strasburg's 54th big league start was his first professional appearance at Petco Park. The big right-hander went to high school in suburban Santee and pitched for Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn at San Diego State before the Nationals took him with the first overall pick in the 2009 amateur draft. He pitched twice at Petco Park for SDSU.	"I heard a lot of 'Welcome home' and a lot of 'Go Aztecs' out there. It's great. I'm just glad they remembered me."	He allowed two runs, one earned, on three hits while striking out four and walking three. He got the final out of the eighth on his 117th pitch.	Strasburg had never thrown a pitch in the eighth inning of a big league start until he faced Everth Cabrera on Thursday night.	Strasburg said he had been looking forward to "just getting deep in the ballgame, getting used to that, getting into the routine of how you're body's going to feel the next day and learning how to recover and getting ready to doing it again."	Strasburg (2-5) had gone seven innings 10 times, including three this year.	He said he was happy manager Davey Johnson let him go back out for the eighth.	"I'm just glad he wasn't waiting for me at the top step after the seventh," Strasburg said. "I went out there in the eighth and I got the first out and it was like, 'All right, so this is what it feels like. I trust Davey's judgment and, obviously, he saw that my stuff was still there. He had the trust in me to go out there and get it done."	Strasburg was supposed to pitch at Petco Park last year, but a rainout pushed that start back.	"I thought he pitched a heck of a ballgame," Johnson said. "It was the first time he's ever gone eight innings. It was a good homecoming for him. I liked it. I didn't think he was as sharp as he usually is, but it was a good ballgame. It was nice to see some offense coming up to give him some run support."	Strasburg earned his first victory since beating Miami on opening day.	In Strasburg's only other appearance against the Padres, he lasted just four innings in a 6-1 loss at Washington on May 15, 2012.	Strasburg held the Padres scoreless through four innings and allowed only one run in the fifth despite loading the bases with one out.	"He kept the ball down for the most part," San Diego's Yonder Alonso said. "We had the bases loaded there and we couldn't get it done."	Harper, back in the lineup three nights after running full-on into the scoreboard in right field at Dodger Stadium, hit a monster shot estimated at 431 feet to straightaway center field on the first pitch he saw from Tyson Ross with two outs in the seventh. Harper's homer nearly reached the base of the batter's eye. It was his 11th.	Harper's violent collision with the wall at Dodger Stadium left the 20-year-old slugger with 11 stitches in his chin and a sore body.  Harper said he felt a little better, but his whole left side was still sore. He played left field and batted third.	LaRoche hit a two-run homer into the sandy play area beyond the fence in right-center off Edinson Volquez (3-4) with one out in the fourth for a 2-0 lead. It was his fifth.	The Nationals added three runs off Volquez in the fifth, on a two-run single by Ryan Zimmerman and an RBI single by Steve Lombardozzi.	Volquez allowed five runs and five hits in five innings, struck out seven and walked four.	San Diego's Jedd Gyorko led off the fifth with a double that caromed off the base of the stands in left and Alexi Amarista walked. With one out, pinch hitter Kyle Blanks hit a sharp grounder to third baseman Ryan Zimmerman, whose throw to second sailed over Steve Lombardozzi for an error that loaded the bases. Everth Cabrera's groundout brought in a run before Strasburg struck out Will Venable.	"He worked his way out of that jam," Padres manager Bud Black said. "We tried to get a little closer. He made a couple of pitches to minimize the damage and that got him through the middle part of the game."	Chris Denorfia hit a sacrifice fly in the sixth.	Game notes	 Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel of Texas A&M, known as "Johnny Football," threw out the ceremonial first pitch. He put a football twist on it by dropping back, scrambling and tossing it to Mark Kotsay, who caught it behind his back. Manziel also took two rounds of batting practice, with mixed results. The bat went flying out of his hands on his first swing, but he later hit a ball off the right-field wall at Petco Park. Manziel took BP while wearing loafers. ... Manziel is in town to work with quarterbacks coach George Whitfield Jr. "He came out here last year as a third-stringer and now he comes out here as a Heisman Trophy winner," Whitfield said. ... Manziel and Padres RHP Burch Smith have known each other since they were kids growing up in Tyler, Texas. Manziel said Smith once pulled a prank on him by locking him a batting cage. ... Johnson, who also went to Texas A&M, chatted up Manziel during batting practice. ... Manziel threw out the ceremonial first pitch before a game between the Texas Rangers and Los Angeles Angels.  ... Padres LF Carlos Quentin missed the game to be with his wife, Jeane, who gave birth to their first son, Clark.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

CHICAGO -- Having already impressed with his arm, Matt Harvey got to show off his bat.	The 24-year-old right-hander won his fifth straight decision, allowing five hits in 7 1/3 innings and singling in the go-ahead run in the seventh to lead the New York Mets over the Chicago Cubs 3-2 Friday.	"This guy is different. He's not your run-of-the-mill young pitcher," Mets manager Terry Collins said. "This guy has got some savvy. He's got great confidence"	Daniel Murphy and David Wright homered for the Mets, and reserve right fielder Marlon Byrd preserved the lead by throwing out a runner at the plate in the eighth inning. The Mets won consecutive games for the first time since May 1 and 3.	Harvey (5-0) won his first four starts of the year, then failed to get a decision in his next four outings.	"I think today, the big thing was the curveball," Harvey said after his 19th major league start. "I had that working well and was able to throw that for a strike when I needed to."	Collins said that earlier this year he would have pinch hit for Harvey when the pitcher's spot came up following Ankiel's seventh-inning double. But with the Mets' offense struggling, Collins is thinking more about pitching and defense.	Harvey went up to the plate and singled to break a 2-2 tie.	"That was awesome," Harvey said. "That was huge for me."	Chicago took a 2-1 lead in the first with three hits off Harvey, who had allowed just three first-inning hits this year.	Starlin Castro singled, Anthony Rizzo doubled and Alfonso Soriano hit an RBI single to shortstop Ruben Tejada, who ranged behind second and bounced a catchable one-hop throw past first baseman Ike Davis for a throwing error as Rizzo came home.	Nate Schierholtz lined to center, starting a streak in which Harvey retired 20 of 21 batters around Castro's one-out single in the third.	"All of the sudden, he got it going," Collins said. "He had such a rough first inning. You worry about it late in the game. Then all the sudden he started cruising. He started getting a feel for it. I tell you, he is a horse, no doubt about it."	Harvey gave up both runs, struck out six and walked none as his ERA rose from 1.45 to 1.55. Scott Rice, Greg Burke and Bobby Parnell combined for one-hit relief, with Parnell pitching a perfect ninth for his fifth save in seven chances.	"After that first inning, it was kind of the Matt Harvey show," Cubs manager Dale Sveum said. "He's obviously the real deal."	Edwin Jackson (1-6), coming off a victory at Washington on May 11, gave up three runs and seven hits in 6 2/3 innings.	Wright's sixth homer of the season, on a 1-2 pitch, put the Mets ahead in the first. Murphy's opposite-field home run to left leading off the fourth tied the score at 2.	Ankiel doubled to right just over Schierholtz's glove with one out in the seventh. Harvey, at that point 2 for 18 at the plate this year, singled to left.	Byrd preserved the lead in the eighth. Darwin Barney singled leading off and was sacrificed to second, and Rice relieved Harvey.	David DeJesus singled sharply to right, and third-base coach David Bell sent Barney home. Byrd threw on the fly to catcher John Buck, and the ball beat Barney by about 15 feet. Barney didn't even bother to slide and slowed down as Buck applied the tag.	"Turned out it wasn't a very close play," Bell said. "It's disappointing, it was the wrong decision. I just watched the replay again, and it wasn't close. As a third-base coach, you want to make the right decision, and that wasn't the right decision."	Game notes	Cubs manager Dale Sveum would not put a date on the return of RHP Matt Garza to the starting rotation. Garza threw 75 pitches in six innings Thursday for Triple-A Iowa. Garza suffered a training camp lat muscle strain and has not pitched for the Cubs this season. "He did what we asked him to do," Sveum said. ... Davis ended an 0-for-24 slide with a sixth-inning single.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

BALTIMORE --  Tampa Bay Rays manager Joe Maddon wanted to stay away from overworked closer Fernando Rodney and setup man Joel Peralta.	He had to throw that idea out when the Baltimore Orioles staged a big rally, and Peralta stepped up.	The right-hander got four outs for his first save of the season and the Rays held on for a 12-10 victory over the slumping Orioles on Friday night.	"We've been blowing some games, so tonight was really special for me," Peralta said.	Kelly Johnson hit a three-run homer and an RBI single in Tampa Bay's highest scoring game of the season. Yunel Escobar had three hits and three RBIs, and Desmond Jennings added a two-run single.	The Orioles surrendered a season-high 17 hits for the second straight game and gave up their most runs in any game this season. Baltimore has allowed 27 runs and 52 hits while losing four of its last five games.	Chris Dickerson hit a three-run homer in Baltimore's six-run eighth inning, but the Orioles' rally stalled from there.	"I felt like we were going to make a run at them somewhere if we could keep them from scoring. That was our challenge tonight," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. "We dug ourselves a pretty big hole."	Jeremy Hellickson (2-2) was charged with eight runs and 10 hits in 7 2/3 innings, but still managed to get the win.	Johnson drove a full-count pitch from Jason Hammel (5-2) over the wall in right in the third, capping Tampa Bay's four-run outburst with his sixth homer. Johnson singled in James Loney, Escobar doubled home a run and Jennings had his big hit in the fifth, helping the Rays open a 9-3 lead.	"We've been playing good offense up and down the lineup," Maddon said.	Hammel (5-2) allowed a season-high seven runs and 10 hits in 4 2/3 innings with four strikeouts and two walks in his first loss since April 7. The right-hander's ERA has increased from 4.10 to 5.72 after allowing 13 runs and 18 hits over his last two starts.	"I'm missing over the plate, arm-side fastballs," Hammel said. "That's honestly about it. It's a pretty simple fix, but for right now it's seemingly difficult for me."	Manny Machado, Chris Davis and Matt Wieters each drove in two runs for Baltimore, which finished with 13 hits. J.J. Hardy went 2 for 3 with his eighth homer, extending his hitting streak to 12 games.	After Dickerson connected against Kyle Farnsworth in the eighth, Yamaico Navarro reached on a two-out single. Peralta came in and got Nate McLouth to fly out, then pitched a perfect ninth.	"We really should have been able to put that game away a lot better," Maddon said. "I did not want to have to get Joel or Fernando up tonight. That was the concern."	Tampa Bay had lost two in a row after winning six straight games. Rodney blew a save opportunity when he was charged with three runs in a 4-3 loss to the Boston Red Sox on Thursday.	Game notes	 Tampa Bay 3B Evan Longoria went 2 for 3 while extending his hitting streak to 11 games. ... Baltimore RHP Miguel Gonzalez (blister) likely will start Tuesday against the New York Yankees barring a setback, Showalter said. Placed on the 15-day DL on May 4, Gonzalez is 2-2 in six starts. ... RHP Jair Jurrjens will be recalled from Triple-A Norfolk to start on Saturday, Showalter said. The former National League All-Star will face RHP Roberto Hernandez.

CLEVELAND --  Jason Kipnis had made a habit of hitting first-inning home runs this season. On Friday night, he tried something different.	Kipnis hit a three-run homer with two outs in the 10th inning off Lucas Luetge to lead the Cleveland Indians to a 6-3 win over the Seattle Mariners.	The home run was the seventh of the season for Kipnis. The first five came in the first inning before he homered in the eighth in Wednesday's win over Philadelphia. His walkoff shot Friday came on an 0-1 pitch and capped a two-out rally that began with a walk and an infield hit.	"This was outstanding," said Kipnis, who was mobbed by his teammates at home plate. "This was one of the more fun nights I've had on a baseball field."	The Indians have won 15 of 19 and are 10-2 at Progressive Field since April 30. Vinnie Pestano (1-0), activated from the disabled list before the game, worked around a one-out walk in the 10th.	The game drew a crowd of 34,282, a total boosted by a postgame fireworks show and a $1 hot dog promotion. The Indians are last in the majors in attendance despite being 18-7 since April 20. The biggest crowd of the season since the home opener was not lost on Cleveland's players.	"That was awesome," Kipnis said. "I was just as amped up as they were rounding first base. You never want to put too much emphasis on different wins, but we knew we had a big crowd. To get a win in front of them and to get it like this in front of them, hopefully it brings some of them back, because we had a lot of fun tonight."	The Indians posted their third walk-off win of the season and are 4-0 in extra innings.	"There were no words coming out when I was rounding (the bases) and screaming," Kipnis said. "It was just sounds, just gibberish screams."	Added Indians manager Terry Francona: "Watching the guys jumping all over each other is fun."	Drew Stubbs, who homered in the fifth, drew a walk off Luetge (0-1). Stubbs broke for second with a 1-2 count on Michael Bourn, and Luetge threw to first baseman Justin Smoak, but Stubbs beat the throw to shortstop Brendan Ryan. Bourn hit a slow roller past the mound and second baseman Dustin Ackley's throw to first was late.	"That was the matchup we wanted, lefty-on-lefty there, but he (Luetge) just spun one up there and they took advantage of it," Mariners manager Eric Wedge said. "Speed got us there in the 10th. The kid (Stubbs) did a heck of a job getting to second base, and Bourn is just so fast."	The Mariners fell short of reaching the .500 mark for the first time since they were 4-4 on April 8. Raul Ibanez's two-run homer in the sixth tied the game, and the bullpens on both sides took over.	Chris Perez retired the side in order in the ninth. Perez, who has been nursing a stiff shoulder, was pitching for the first time since May 11. Pestano had been on the DL since May 1 with a sore right elbow.	Mariners relievers Charlie Furbush and Carter Capps combined to pitch 3 1/3 scoreless innings. Capps struck out Mark Reynolds to start the 10th. Luetge got Michael Brantley to ground out before running into trouble. Seattle lost for just the seventh time in 19 games.	Ubaldo Jimenez allowed two runs and struck out a season-high nine in five innings. He was pulled after Smoak led off the sixth with a single. Rich Hill was brought in to face Ibanez, who homered to right on an 0-1 pitch to tie the game. Jimenez, who had won three consecutive starts, struck out five of the first seven batters he faced. Seattle rookie Brandon Maurer allowed three runs in six innings. The right-hander matched a career high with six strikeouts.	Jason Giambi's sacrifice fly gave Cleveland the lead in the second. Maurer's wild pitch allowed another run to score. Kendry Morales' solo homer into the second deck in right field cut the lead to 2-1 in the fourth. Stubbs homered in the fifth to give Cleveland a two-run lead.	Nick Swisher drew a leadoff walk in the second and took third on a double by Carlos Santana. Swisher scored on Giambi's fly ball to right, which also moved Santana to third. Santana scored when Maurer bounced a pitch in front of the plate with Brantley batting.	Morales, who flirted with an extra-base hit down the right-field line before lining out to Jimenez in the first, homered on a 2-0 pitch with one out in the fourth.	Stubbs' drive to right with one out in the fifth landed in Seattle's bullpen, barely clearing the wall.	Kipnis and Ryan were came up hobbled in the third. Kipnis banged his head into the right leg of Ryan as he dove into second on a failed steal attempt. Ryan applied the tag, but both players were down for a couple of moments after the play as the two managers and trainers ran on the field. Kipnis and Ryan remained in the game.	Mariners outfielder Michael Morse was a late scratch with an irritated eye. Endy Chavez took his spot in right field and batted eighth.	Game notes	 Indians RHP Brett Myers (sore elbow) pitched three scoreless innings for Double-A Akron on a rehab assignment against Erie on Friday. ... Mariners RHP Hector Noesi, who made an emergency start Thursday in place of RHP Aaron Harang (lower back stiffness), was optioned to Triple-A Tacoma before the game. RHP Danny Farquhar was called up from Tacoma to provide some bullpen depth for the next couple of days. ... Wedge said Harang was examined by a chiropractor Friday and is still set to make his next start Tuesday against the Angels. ... Jimenez hasn't won four consecutive starts since 2010. ... Mariners LHP Joe Saunders (3-4) meets Indians RHP Zach McAllister (3-3) on Saturday.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

NEW YORK --  In a revolving-door season, Joe Girardi is grateful he has to spend little time worrying about Hiroki Kuroda.	There are those moments, though, that the New York Yankees' manager has to remind himself the Japanese ace is not one of the many young faces in his clubhouse.	Kuroda gave another steady performance Friday night, pitching two-hit ball for eight dominant innings and leading the Yankees to one more victory over Mark Buehrle and the Toronto Blue Jays, 5-0 to end a two-game skid.	"One thing we do pay attention to is some of his pitch counts because he's not 25 either, but he goes out there and sometimes he acts like he is," Girardi said. "So we have to make sure we don't get confused and forget how old he is and that we take care of him; we're responsible with him and make sure he can bounce back every start because that's what you want."	And what they desperately need right now.	With lefty Andy Pettitte joining fellow starter Ivan Nova on to the disabled list earlier Friday, two of the 13 pinstriped players sidelined with injuries this season, the Yankees can't take any risks with Kuroda. And that is why Girardi didn't hesitate to lift the 38-year-old after the eighth and 109 pitches.	Kuroda (6-2) struck out five and walked one in cooling off a club that had scored 33 runs in its previous three games and had won a season-high four in a row.	The Yankees' most consistent starter since the start of last season, Kuroda won for the fourth time in five starts. He is 2-0 in three starts against the Blue Jays this year -- matching up each time against Buehrle (1-3) -- allowing four runs in 21 1/3 innings.	Preston Claiborne finished the four-hitter.	"In the first inning I knew this was going to be a good night for us," rookie catcher Austin Romine said.	Romine and Brett Gardner had run-scoring hits, Robinson Cano hit an RBI grounder and Jayson Nix had two sacrifice flies in dropping Buehrle to 1-10 in 15 starts against the Yankees. The left-hander hasn't beaten New York since April 10, 2004, when he was with the Chicago White Sox.	The AL East-leading Yankees defeated last-place Toronto for the fifth straight time this season in New York and for the seventh time in eight games overall.	Kuroda gave up a leadoff double to Melky Cabrera and didn't allow another hit until Edwin Encarnacion's one-out single in the seventh. Between the two hits, Kuroda faced the minimum, picking off Munenori Kawasaki after a third-inning walk.	"All my pitches were pretty good," Kuroda said. "Felt good, especially in the first inning when I struck out (Jose) Bautista and Encarnacion."	Kuroda helped himself get out of the first inning unscathed by snaring J.P. Arencibia's liner. Fans cheered and laughed at the fortunate catch when the replay of Kuroda sticking out his glove for the ball was shown on the video board in center field. Kuroda also made a nice play for the first out of the second, bounding off the mound to field Adam Lind's tapper.	Gardner led off the bottom of the first with a triple and scored on Cano's grounder to second. Buehrle settled down, allowing only Nix's third-inning walk before rookie David Adams singled leading off the fifth.	"When you run into hot pitching like that, you try to shut them down as long as you can," Buehrle said.	Romine singled with one out and Gardner walked to load the bases before Nix's fly to left made it 2-0.	Aaron Loup relieved Buehrle after the first three batters in the seventh had hits, including an RBI double by Romine. Gardner slapped an opposite-field single past diving third baseman Brett Lawrie with the infield in, and Nix followed with a long fly to center that upped the lead to five runs.	"Buehrle was rolling along, too," Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. "He had only given up two runs and was matching (Kuroda) there and kept us in the game, and then they exploded on us late there. But I thought he did a nice job as well."	Buehrle yielded five runs and six hits in six-plus innings. He walked three and struck out four.	Game notes	 RHP Joba Chamberlain (right oblique strain) played long toss at Yankee Stadium. He is scheduled for a bullpen session Sunday. ... The Yankees recalled Vidal Nuno from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. ... Blue Jays RHP Josh Johnson (triceps) threw a side session. Gibbons said he felt good. He will go to the Blue Jays' complex in Dunedin, Fla., next week and will make a minor league rehab start. ... Blue Jays RHP Dustin McGowan (60-day DL, shoulder) is going to move to Triple-A Buffalo to continue his rehab. He was with Class-A Dunedin. ...  RHP Brandon Morrow (1-2), who had his start Wednesday pushed back because of back and neck issues, is scheduled to get the ball against the Yankees Saturday. RHP David Phelps (1-2) is set to start for New York.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

PHILADELPHIA -- The Philadelphia Phillies turned to small ball after the long ball hurt them.	Domonic Brown drove in the tiebreaking run on an infield grounder in the eighth and the Phillies snapped the Cincinnati Reds' six-game winning streak with a 5-3 victory on Friday night.	Jimmy Rollins hit a two-run homer and Cliff Lee threw seven sharp innings for the Phillies, who've won four of five.	"We're more fundamentally sound the last week or so," Lee said.	Joey Votto hit a tying solo homer off Antonio Bastardo in the eighth, and Jay Bruce connected for a two-run shot for Cincinnati.	Lee gave up two runs and six hits, striking out seven. Justin De Fratus (2-0) got two batters out in the eighth and Jonathan Papelbon finished for his eighth save in eight tries.	Reds rookie starter Tony Cingrani allowed three runs and five hits in five innings.	"I made a couple mistakes," Cingrani said. "I just didn't get inside enough."	After Cincinnati tied it in the eighth, the Phillies answered in the bottom half against Sean Marshall (0-1). Michael Young worked his third walk of the game with one out. Ryan Howard followed with a check-swing infield single. Jonathan Broxton came in and hit Delmon Young to load the bases.	Brown then hit a grounder up the middle that shortstop Zack Cozart fielded on the second base side. Second baseman Brandon Phillips tried to barehand Cozart's flip and dropped it for an error. Young crossed the plate with the go-ahead run as the Phillies took the lead without hitting a ball out of the infield.	"I know he throws 97, 98 mph," Brown said. "I was looking for a pitch I can drive."	His bouncer worked just as well.	Howard then scored on a headfirst dive on Carlos Ruiz's sacrifice fly for a 5-3 lead.	The Phillies slugged their way to five straight NL East titles from 2007-11 and won the World Series in 2008. As their core players get older, fans want to see the team manufacture more runs instead of relying on homers.	"When you talk about playing small ball, you have to have the talent," manager Charlie Manuel said, adding he's tired of hearing questions about it.	The Reds closed to 3-2 when Bruce connected in the sixth after Phillips led off with a double.	They tied it when Votto took Bastardo deep to right-center leading off the eighth. Bastardo, who normally works the seventh, was pitching in the setup role because Mike Adams is day to day with a mid-back strain.	Bastardo left after Bruce hit a one-out single. De Fratus came in and nearly gave up a go-ahead extra-base hit to Todd Frazier, but right fielder Young made a leaping catch at the warning track.	"I'm concerned about a lot of things," Manuel said, refusing to single out Bastardo. "I'd like to see us play good, solid baseball. We did some things sloppy that got overlooked tonight."	Rollins blasted a 3-1 pitch out to left to put the Phillies up 2-0 in the third inning. He is batting .375 (9 for 24) in his last six games.	Lee, a good-hitting pitcher, helped himself with a leadoff double in the bottom of the fifth. Lee knocks balls out of the park routinely in batting practice, and just missed his third career homer when his drive to right bounced high off the wall. He hustled into second after trotting down the first-base line, and appeared slightly annoyed the ball didn't go out.	Lee advanced to third on a sacrifice by Rollins and scored on Michael Young's two-out triple to deep left-center for a 3-0 lead.	"I thought it was gone," Lee said. "But I still scored. Mike got a big two-out hit."	The Reds had chances in the first two innings, but couldn't get a key hit. Lee stranded five runners, striking out Cozart to leaves the bases loaded in the second.	Game notes	An MRI revealed a strain in the middle of Adams' back. ... The Phillies recalled RHP B.J. Rosenberg from Triple-A Lehigh Valley and optioned LHP Raul Valdes down. ... Rollins is tied with Chase Utley for the team lead with 16 extra-base hits. ... The Reds are 8-3 on the road since losing eight in a row away from home in April. ... Frazier is hitless in his last 19 at-bats. ... Cincinnati swept a three-game series at home vs. the Phillies last month. .. Bronson Arroyo (3-4, 3.76 ERA) takes the mound for the Reds against Kyle Kendrick (4-1, 2.47 ERA) on Saturday afternoon.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

PITTSBURGH -- All Jimmy Paredes was thinking about was catching the ball. Same with Jake Elmore.	Not that concentration helped.	Russell Martin's bases-loaded fly ball popped out Paredes' glove when he ran into the second baseman with two outs in the ninth inning, and the second missed catch of the night by a Houston right fielder helped the Pittsburgh Pirates rally past the Astros 5-4 Friday.	"I'm anticipating the ball being hit to me, just like I do on every pitch," Paredes said. "All I'm thinking about is catching the ball for the third out. That's all I wanted to do. I was watching the ball and then I hit into him. Sometimes things like that happen in this game, and it's frustrating to lose like this."	Houston manager Bo Porter said Paredes, who was charged with an error, should have peeled off and let Elmore make the play. Paredes collided with second baseman Jose Altuve on Monday night while chasing a pop fly at Detroit.	"It's not a lack of communication, because there's only one person that should be communicating," Porter said. "The infielder is not saying anything. If he gets underneath the ball, the outfielder is running in and he's looking at the infielder. And if the infielder is waving his hands and under the ball, you let him take the ball."	That wasn't Houston's only fielding foible.	Down 4-1, Pittsburgh started its comeback in the sixth when Chris Carter, usually a designated hitter, dropped Andrew McCutchen's fly ball to right for a three-base error and Garrett Jones followed with a double.	Pedro Alvarez hit a two-run homer in the eighth, a 462-foot drive that cleared the right-field stands and went into the Allegheny River on one hop.	Starling Marte singled off Edgar Gonzalez (0-1) leading off the ninth, and Travis Snider hit into a forceout, with the Astros failing to turn a double play with a late relay throw to first by Elmore.	McCutchen's single put runners at the corners, and Gonzalez fielded Brandon Inge's comebacker and dropped it for an error as he turned to throw to second, missing his chance to start an inning-ending double play.	Neil Walker took a called third strike with a full count, and Martin lifted a full-count pitch to short right-center field, where Elmore settled under the ball and Paredes slammed into him as the ball hit his glove and fell to the field.	"In that situation, the crowd is so loud that you can't hear anybody calling for the ball," Elmore said. "We had already let one ball drop, and I didn't want a second one to fall, too. I was waving my arms, hoping Jimmy would see me, but he had his eye on the ball the whole time."	Justin Wilson (4-0) pitched a scoreless ninth as the Pirates (25-17) won for the seventh time in eight games to move a season-high eight games over .500.	"This game's crazy sometimes," Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said. "The crowd helped us there on the error. They made it tough on the fielders and they created a break for us."	McCutchen homered and had three hits for Pittsburgh.	Houston's 11-31 start is its worst and matched Miami for the poorest record in the major leagues.	Astros starter Jordan Lyles allowed two runs -- one earned -- and four hits in five innings and is 0-4 with a 6.75 ERA in six career starts against Pittsburgh.	Pirates starter Jeanmar Gomez gave up four runs -- three earned -- and five hits in 4 2/3 innings.	Houston built a 4-1 lead on Jason Castro's sacrifice fly in the first and a three-run third that included Matt Dominguez's solo homer, Elmore's run-scoring single and a throwing error by Walker at second.	McCutchen homered in the first.	"Our defense has been one of our strong suits pretty much the whole year," Porter said, "but tonight we did not play good defense and we put ourselves in position where it cost us the ballgame."	Game notes	The Pirates placed RHP Jose Contreras on the bereavement list and recalled RHP Jared Hughes from Triple-A Indianapolis. ... Altuve missed his third straight game because of the death of his grandmother and will be activated from the bereavement list prior to Saturday night's game. Elmore likely will be optioned back to Triple-A Oklahoma. ... Astros RHP Bud Norris will start Tuesday against Kansas City rather than Sunday against Pittsburgh. He left Monday's start because of lower back spasms while warming up for the sixth inning. RHP Lucas Harrell and LHP Dallas Keuchel both had their turns moved up a day. Harrell will face the Pirates on Sunday and Keuchel will pitch Monday against the Royals. ... LHP Philip Humber accepted an outright assignment to Oklahoma after Houston designated him for assignment last weekend.

MIAMI -- Paul Goldschmidt is one of the hottest hitters in baseball.	Goldschmidt homered twice, tied his career high with four hits and drove in four runs to lead the Arizona Diamondbacks over the Miami Marlins 9-2 on Friday night.	"Watch the kid, watch the way he stays with his approach, he's dangerous," Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson said.	Goldschmidt hit a two-run homer in the first, a 428-foot drive to left on an 0-2 pitch, before Chavez homered to right on the very next pitch. He later fouled off six straight pitches in the third before hitting another two-run homer, a drive to left on the 13th pitch of the at-bat that made it 5-0.	"However many I fouled off, all of them were down and away, mostly really good pitches, and fortunately for me he made a mistake," Goldschmidt said.	It was the second career multihomer game for Goldschmidt, who also connected twice May 18 at the Los Angeles Dodgers. He is hitting .414 (29 for 70) with nine homers and 26 RBIs on the road, but .272 with three homers and nine RBIs at Chase Field.	"It's still early in the season so the stats are skewed one way or another so if you get hot for a week or something when you're on the road compared to home," Goldschmidt said. "You just try to go out there and play well. If it happens to be on the road, good. If it's at home, that's good, as well."	Goldschmidt doubled to lead off the seventh and singled in the ninth. He is hitting .440 (22 for 50) in his last 15 games with seven homers, six doubles, and 17 RBIs.	"He's got a lot of talent," said Martin Prado. "We are expecting a lot of things from him. Every time he goes to home plate, we're just waiting for something to happen."	Eric Chavez homered and also had four hits, and Gerardo Parra and Prado had three hits apiece for Arizona, which had 16 hits in all and won its third straight game.	"I just hope we can do this more often, it would sure help our pitching staff," Gibson said.	Trevor Cahill (3-4) won for the third time in four decisions following an 0-3 start, allowing one run, five hits and four walks in eight innings. He walked his first two batters in the third before retiring 13 in a row, 10 on groundballs.	"As the game went along I was able to find my arm slot and worked down in the zone," Cahill said.	Last-place Miami matched its season-high losing streak at six and at 11-31 equaled the 2006 Marlins for the worst 42-game start in franchise history, according to STATS.	"Unfortunately we got down and obviously with our offense were just not able to make up that much ground," Marlins manager Mike Redmond said.	Kevin Slowey (1-4) gave up six runs and seven hits in three innings.	"It was the second time in a week that I haven't given my team a chance to win and that's disappointing," Slowey said.	Arizona led 7-0 before Rob Brantly had an RBI single for Miami. Greg Dobbs had three hits.	Game notes	Following the game, Marlins RHP Jon Rauch was designated for assignment and recalled LHP Duane Below from Triple-A New Orleans. ... Diamondbacks OF Jason Kubel (quadriceps) didn't play. "It's not great. It's kind of finicky," Gibson said. "Some days it's OK. Some days it's not." ...

ATLANTA -- Justin Upton was still the main man for Atlanta, even when the Braves finally had all their sluggers together.	Upton gave Atlanta the lead with a sixth-inning grand slam and the Braves finally unveiled their full-strength lineup, beating the Los Angeles Dodgers 8-5 on Friday night.	Upton drove in five runs hitting behind Jason Heyward, who had two hits with a RBI and scored two runs in his first game back after having his appendix removed April 22.	The homer was Upton's majors-leading 14th of the season, a high shot that appeared bound for the upper deck before landing deep in the left-field seats.	"I got that one pretty good," he said.	Just pretty good?	"As soon as he took that swing, I knew that ball was going to be out of the ballpark," said Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez. "That was one of the prettiest swings I've seen put on a baseball."	It was the first time this season the Braves had Heyward in the lineup along with catcher Brian McCann, who missed the first 30 games while recovering from offseason shoulder surgery. Atlanta also had first baseman Freddie Freeman miss two weeks in April with a strained oblique.	"We've played 40 games and it's the first time we've had the lineup we talked about all winter," Gonzalez said before the game.	Scott Van Slyke hit two homers for the Dodgers, who led 4-2 before Upton's third career grand slam. Los Angeles had won four of its previous five games -- the team's best stretch since early April.	Dodgers manager Don Mattingly was disappointed by his pitching staff's seven walks and errors by third baseman Luis Cruz and left fielder Carl Crawford -- each on line drives hit by Andrelton Simmons -- that led to three unearned runs.	"Too many walks. Giving too many free runners," Mattingly said. "And we've got to catch the baseball. That's all there is to it. You've got to catch the baseball."	Paul Maholm (5-4) allowed eight hits and four runs -- two earned -- in six innings, and Craig Kimbrel pitched the ninth for his 12th save.	Upton's grand slam made Maholm a winner.	"I'll take it every time I start," said Maholm of Upton's big homer. "I'll have to make sure I compensate Justin pretty well for that."	Dodgers rookie Hyun-Jin Ryu overcame a career-high five walks to give up only two runs in five innings, but relievers Matt Guerrier and Paco Rodriguez (0-2) quickly blew the 4-2 lead in the sixth.	After Guerrier gave up a single to pinch-hitter Jordan Schafer, Cruz couldn't handle Simmons' sharp liner, an error that left runners on first and second. Rodriguez walked Heyward to load the bases before Upton's homer deep into the left-field seats.	Crawford missed Simmons' line drive for another error during Atlanta's two-run seventh. Ramiro Pena, who hit a two-out triple, scored on the error and Heyward added a run-scoring single off Ronald Belisario.	Ryu failed to last at least six innings for the first time in nine starts. He gave up five hits with five walks and five strikeouts.	"All day today I was just a little off-balance," Ryu said through an interpreter. "I personally feel bad that I couldn't go longer as a starter. I feel bad for my teammates that I couldn't stay out there a little longer. ... Unfortunately my balls weren't going in the zone today."	A.J. Ellis doubled and scored on Dee Gordon's fielder's choice grounder for the Dodgers in the second. Crawford and Ryu had run-scoring singles in the fourth.	Ryu had strong defensive support in the fifth. Van Slyke, making his first start of the season in right field, had a sliding catch of Chris Johnson's fly ball near the foul line. Matt Kemp then made a diving grab of McCann's fly ball in the left-center gap.	Mattingly said he didn't second-guess his decision to replace Ryu, who needed 100 pitches to make it through five innings.	"I feel fine with it," Mattingly said. "He was done. He was at 100 and he struggled the whole day. That wasn't a decision. It wasn't a tough one to make. At 100, he's pretty much out of gas."	Slumping Braves center fielder B.J. Upton was 0-for-4 with two strikeouts, dropping his batting average to .141 as he hit eighth for the first time this season. He drew scattered boos when he popped out to first baseman Adrian Gonzalez in the second inning and an even louder serenade when his bases-loaded popup to Punto at second base ended the third inning.	Kemp, who grounded out to end the game, was 0-for-5, ending his 14-game hitting streak, which began on April 30.	Game notes	Braves Hall of Famer Hank Aaron attended batting practice. ... Former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalyn, watched the game from their usual seats near the Braves dugout. ... Dodgers INF Jerry Hairston Jr., on the 15-day DL with a left groin strain, was examined by a doctor in Arizona on Friday for a sore left knee. Mattingly called the problem "a little bit of a setback." ... RHP Jordan Walden was placed on the 15-day DL with right shoulder inflammation to clear a spot for Heyward. ... Braves RHP Kris Medlen and Dodgers LHP Chris Capuano each will look for his second win as the series continues on Saturday night. Medlen is only 1-5 but has a 3.44 ERA.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- With a little help from slugger Miguel Cabrera, Rick Porcello and the Detroit Tigers slowed down the Texas Rangers.	Cabrera went 3 for 4 with a go-ahead double in the fifth inning to back Porcello and lift the Tigers over the Rangers 2-1 Friday night in a matchup of division leaders.	Texas had scored 51 runs in its past eight games, going 7-1 in that stretch. Porcello and four relievers, however, cooled off a Rangers offense that knocked out ace Justin Verlander in the third inning Thursday night.	Cabrera broke a scoreless tie with an RBI double off the wall in left that scored Andy Dirks. Cabrera scored later in the fifth to provide the Tigers with just enough offense to give manager Jim Leyland his 1,699th career victory.	"We had some opportunities and we were able to score just enough runs to beat them today," Detroit catcher Alex Avila said. "And on the flip side, our guys were able to keep it at a minimum when they had opportunities. We were able to get out of big jams."	Porcello (2-2) allowed one run and five hits in 5 2/3 innings with six strikeouts and a walk as the Tigers rebounded from a 10-4 loss Thursday night.	The 24-year-old Porcello is 2-0 with a 3.24 ERA in four starts since giving up nine runs in two-thirds of an inning April 20 against the Los Angeles Angels.	Detroit remained tied with the Cleveland Indians atop the AL Central.	"I think I'm in a little bit of a groove for sure," Porcello said. "I'm getting better results now, so it's nice."	Joaquin Benoit escaped a first-and-third jam with one out in the eighth when he induced Nelson Cruz's double-play grounder. Cruz also bounced into a double play in the fourth when the Rangers had runners on first and second with nobody out.	The Rangers, owners of the best record in the AL, went 0 for 8 with runners in scoring position.	"You want to be up in those situations," Cruz said. "I just hope to get another chance so I come through."	Jose Valverde got three groundouts around a one-out walk to Geovany Soto in the ninth, getting his fourth save in five chances this season.	"You don't expect a 2-1 ballgame in this ballpark too many times," Leyland said. "It's a lightning rod and you can hit it out of here at any time."	Soto homered for a second straight game, a solo shot off Porcello in the fifth that brought the Rangers within 2-1.	Rookie Nick Tepesch (3-4) gave up two runs, six hits and three walks in five innings as Detroit stopped the Rangers' three-game winning streak.	"Detroit has a pretty good lineup," Tepesch said. "I just have to take the positives from this start and be ready for the next one."	Dirks led off the fifth with a bloop single to center and advanced to second on a groundout.	Cabrera, hitting .509 (27 for 53) with runners in scoring position, lined an 0-1 pitch off the wall in left field near the out of town scoreboard for his AL-leading 42nd RBI. Cabrera scored on Avila's sacrifice fly.	Cabrera nearly put Detroit ahead in the third when he singled to center with Dirks on second base. Leonys Martin made a perfect throw to Soto at the plate for the out.	Game notes	Texas RHP Alexi Ogando, placed on the DL Thursday with right biceps tendinitis, underwent an MRI that showed no structural damage. ... Texas 2B Ian Kinsler did not start because of bruised ribs after he was hit by a Verlander pitch Thursday night. Kinsler entered in the ninth as pinch runner. ... Detroit's Torii Hunter is two home runs shy of 300 in his career. ... Rangers RHP Justin Miller (right elbow surgery) was scheduled to begin a rehab assignment Friday night at Double-A Frisco.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Will Middlebrooks gave Boston a comeback victory the night before with a big swing. This time, he dropped down a bunt to advance the go-ahead run.	After losing 93 games last season, the Red Sox aren't worried about style. A win is a win.	Jonny Gomes hit a sacrifice fly in the 10th inning to lift the Red Sox past the Minnesota Twins 3-2 on Friday night.	"We don't want to be the heart-attack kids, but it's a good character check for us right away," Gomes said.	The Red Sox have won three straight after losing 10 of their previous 14 games, while the Twins have dropped three in a row after winning six of nine.	Twins reliever Josh Roenicke (1-1) gave up a single and a walk to open the 10th. After the sacrifice by Middlebrooks, Stephen Drew was intentionally walked to load the bases. Then Gomes sent a drive to center field, where Aaron Hicks caught the ball but double-clutched on his throw after bumping into left fielder Oswaldo Arcia. Hicks didn't have a chance to get the speedy Dustin Pedroia.	"I would have liked to have seen Hicks come up clean with that one and have a shot at throwing him out," Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said.	At Tampa Bay on Thursday, Middlebrooks hit a three-run double in the ninth to give Boston a 4-3 victory. The only prior sacrifice of the second-year third baseman's entire professional career came in 2008 for Class-A Lowell, but manager John Farrell didn't hesitate to call for the bunt.	"He's a very good athlete. He's got good hand-eye coordination," Farrell said. "Knowing that it wasn't part of his game as an offensive player, still I thought the game situation called for it. And he executed it perfectly."	Alex Wilson (1-0) picked up the victory by getting the last out of the ninth and Koji Uehara threw a perfect 10th for his first save, with closers Joel Hanrahan and Andrew Bailey both on the disabled list.	Yes, the Red Sox relievers had a big hand in this, too, after Clay Buchholz recovered from an early two-run homer by Pedro Florimon, just the second time the right-hander was taken deep this season.	Buchholz walked three, including one in the fifth while the Twins loaded the bases with one out. But struggling slugger Josh Willingham took a called third strike, and Justin Morneau flied out to left field at medium depth. Morneau's 11-game hitting streak ended.	Starting with Willingham, the Red Sox retired 17 straight batters to finish the game.	"We've got a good staff. That's really what it comes down to," said Buchholz, who struck out nine batters over seven innings, including five in a row spanning the first and second frames. He was stuck with a no-decision for the third straight start and couldn't match Tampa Bay's Matt Moore with the second 7-0 record in the majors this year.	Buchholz's ERA, second-lowest among American League qualifiers, actually rose nine points to 1.78.	"Buch's throwing the ball really well. I just want to pick up wherever he leaves off," said Andrew Miller, who struck out three and went five up and five down.	Florimon also had a hand in three double plays induced over six innings by Twins starter Vance Worley, who gave up just one unearned run on David Ortiz's RBI single. The shortstop made a slick pivot and quick throw to end the third and the fifth on grounders hit by Pedroia.	Florimon had a chance to start a fourth, with Brian Duensing pitching in the seventh, but Jacoby Ellsbury's sharp bouncer glanced off his glove as he tried to make a sliding stop. The ball rolled into center field for a single, and Gomes -- who led off with a walk -- scored to tie the game at 2.	With Joe Mauer and his 14-game hitting streak on the bench because of a stiff back, the Twins had only two players in the lineup entering the game with a batting average better than Florimon's .247. But Trevor Plouffe doubled off the wall to start the third, and with one out Florimon drove a first-pitch curveball just inside the foul pole and just over the right-field wall to put the Twins up 2-1.	Buchholz has finished seven innings in all but one of his nine starts this year, against the Twins at home two weeks ago, and allowed more than two runs in only one turn, also in that game when the Twins scored four times against him. Buchholz's last home run surrendered was in his first start on April 3.	"Team wins. That's what this game's about. There's absolutely no disappointment," he said.	Game notes	 Morneau, whose 17 RBIs are the most in the majors in May, dropped to 6 for 8 with 13 RBIs with the bases loaded this season. ... Red Sox backup catcher David Ross, on the 7-day DL due to post-concussion symptoms, had an exam pushed back until Monday. He is still light-headed and fatigued. ... The Red Sox will send RH Ryan Dempster (2-4, 3.75 ERA) to the mound on Saturday, opposite LH Scott Diamond (3-3, 4.08 ERA) of the Twins. Both of them gave up six runs and took the loss in their last start.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

ST. LOUIS --  David Freese waited a long time for this curtain call. He was impressed with the patience of St. Louis' fans.	Freese hit a grand slam for his first homer of the season, and the Cardinals used a five-run first inning to beat the Milwaukee Brewers 7-6 on Friday night.	"That's the biggest thing about this, you want to join the fun," Freese said. "Fortunately enough, I haven't done squat this year and we've got a heck of a record."	The Brewers made it close on a pair of three-run homers by Aramis Ramirez off Jaime Garcia before losing for the 13th time in 15 games. The bottom four spots in the lineup were a combined 0 for 15.	"Nice to see Rammy get a couple," Milwaukee manager Ron Roenicke said. "I think he's been swinging the ball really well and hasn't had much to show for it."	The Cardinals had five hits and a walk while batting around against Wily Peralta (3-4) in the first, but the right-hander was still in the game when Garcia (5-2) was chased with one out in the sixth. Milwaukee got one hit in 3 2/3 innings against three relievers, with Edward Mujica working the ninth for his 12th save in 12 chances.	"The bullpen did a great job, they picked me up basically," Garcia said. "I didn't do my job."	Ryan Braun reached on a leadoff single in the eighth, but was caught stealing for a double play after Trevor Rosenthal struck out Ramirez. Carlos Gomez then popped up a bunt to end the inning.	Freese entered with a .209 average, four RBIs and a .287 on-base percentage, struggling to find his stroke after starting the season on the 15-day disabled list with a back injury from chasing a foul ball in spring training. He batted .293 last year with 20 homers and 79 RBIs, the first time he played more than 100 games in the majors.	Freese didn't think failing to produce in his hometown made it any tougher, mentioning numerous helpful suggestions. He thought the best advice came from those who told him to just be himself and forget about his numbers.	"You hear the crowd when it went out, that shows how much they care about their team," Freese said. "It's cool to come out here every day. That curtain call was definitely probably more special than the home run."	Peralta said Freese hit a changeup that was supposed to be down and away but hung over the middle. The Brewers thought Peralta had some bad luck earlier in the inning.	"We hit three ground balls in the first inning, they're outs," Roenicke said. "They hit ground balls, they're hits, so you get a little frustrated.	"I don't want to say that's why he made the bad pitch to Freese, he just got one up and Freese did a nice job of hitting."	Matt Holliday had two hits and two RBIs for St. Louis, which has won 13 of 16 and leads the National League at 27-14. Allen Craig had three hits and a walk and leadoff man Matt Carpenter had three hits and scored twice.	Ramirez lined a pitch into left-field stands in the fourth for just his second hit in four starts, and cleared the wall in center in the sixth for his third homer of the season. It was his 26th career multihomer game and left him with 32 homers against the Cardinals, tied with Adam Dunn for second-most among active players.	The first inning has been by far the Brewers' best this season. They had outscored opponents 35-9, the most runs in the majors and fewest allowed.	Peralta appeared to have a good shot at escaping the inning down just a run when he struck out Jon Jay for the second out. Jay entered with a .440 career average against Milwaukee, and Freese had been in a season-long slump with just one extra-base hit and one RBI this month.	Freese then hammered a 1-1 pitch to straightaway center with a stroke reminiscent of the 2011 postseason when he was World Series and NL championship series MVP. Freese made a curtain call responding to a sellout crowd, but struck out his last two trips against Peralta.	Jay got an RBI single in his second trip to make it 6-0 in the third.	Garcia retired nine in a row on 28 pitches before Norichika Aoki slapped a single to open the fourth. Braun walked with one out and Ramirez cut the deficit in half, lining a 3-1 pitch into the left-field seats.	Garcia was charged with six runs and six hits in 5 1/3 innings.	Game notes	 Roenicke called his first team meeting of the year Thursday after getting outscored 10-2 in consecutive losses at Pittsburgh. ... Roenicke plans to rest Ramirez every third game or so for now while the veteran, who returned in early May from a left knee sprain that knocked him out a month, regains strength and form. "I don't think I can't say that in a week from now, I can leave him out there and not worry about. I know I'm not there," Roenicke said before the game.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DENVER --  Jordan Pacheco had his first career grand slam baseball waiting for him on his chair after the game, sealed tightly in a plastic bag.	If only his tiebreaking homer would've sealed the win as tight.	No such luck. Not here at Coors Field, where big leads can shrink oh so rapidly.	Pacheco gave the team a seemingly safe cushion in the fifth, Carlos Gonzalez later added an insurance homer and the Colorado Rockies weathered a late rally by the San Francisco Giants for a 10-9 win on Friday night.	With that, the Rockies snapped a 10-game skid against the Giants.	Sure, it was just one win, but it was a big one for the Rockies' psyche.	"It's obvious we've had some rough history against the Giants," manager Walt Weiss said. "It's just nice to be able to fight back and, in the end, put a game away."	It would be far from easy.	The Giants, who rallied from an early six-run deficit the night before, were on the comeback trail again Friday.	Down five, they made things interesting by scoring three times in the seventh. It could've been more, but Dexter Fowler made a diving catch in center to end the inning.	"Game changer," Weiss said.	After Buster Posey made it a 10-9 game in the eighth with a two-out homer off Matt Belisle, Hunter Pence followed with a double. But Belisle got Brett Pill to ground out and strand Pence.	In the ninth, Rafael Betancourt struck out the side for his 10th save in as many chances.	"That's a tough-guy save right there, because the game was pretty crazy," Weiss said.	Pacheco laced his first homer of the season to left on a hanging slider from Madison Bumgarner (4-2), who failed to protect an early four-run lead.	"Felt good," Pacheco said with a modest shrug.	Fowler had a feeling it might be a big night for Pacheco, who was filling in for Todd Helton at first base. They took early batting practice together and the ball was flying off Pacheco's bat.	"I saw the thump he had," Fowler said. "So that (homer) didn't surprise me."	Jorge De La Rosa (5-3) entered the game without giving up a run at Coors Field in 12 innings. He was hit hard, surrendering five runs in five innings, only to settle down enough to earn the win.	Gonzalez, Troy Tulowitzki and Wilin Rosario -- the heart of the Rockies' batting order -- finished with a combined six hits, four RBIs and five runs scored. Gonzalez added an insurance run with his homer in the sixth.	"Huge win," Gonzalez said. "This team is tough to beat."	Pablo Sandoval had three hits and drove in two runs for San Francisco, while Marco Scutaro extended his hitting streak to 16 games.	Bumgarner turned in his first clunker against the Rockies in quite a while. He had won six of his last seven starts before struggling on Friday. The lefty allowed a season-high nine runs -- seven earned -- in just 4 2/3 innings. His ERA climbed nearly a full run to 3.09.	Trying to preserve a one-run lead in the fifth, Bumgarner gave up a game-tying single to Rosario. A walk to D.J. LeMahieu loaded the bases for Pacheco, who sent the first pitch from Bumgarner over the fence.	"That grand slam wasn't too fun," Bumgarner said. "I just wasn't making pitches when I needed to (in order) to get guys."	Pacheco also had an RBI on a grounder in the second.	"Just glad I was able to come through for our team," he said.	The Giants had a frightful night in the field, committing a season-high four errors. Two of those miscues came in the third, when Sandoval had a throwing error to begin the inning and center fielder Angel Pagan later sent a high throw to third base that ended up in the Giants' dugout, allowing Dexter Fowler to trot home. Tulowitzki tied the game at 4 with an RBI single.	"Too many errors, particularly in this ballpark," manager Bruce Bochy said. "They fought back, I'll say that. But we're making way too many errors.	"We've got to tighten things up."	The Giants have made themselves quite comfortable at Coors Field, winning 14 of their last 20 in this hitter's park. Weiss quickly dismissed the notion the Giants have a psychological edge on his team.	Although, this does help.	"We know we've got to beat these guys," Weiss said. "We know they've had our number over the last couple of years. They're the world champions, so you have to go through them eventually. We know all that stuff. It's not stuff we have to talk about, it's already there. Got to go out and play well, find ways to win games."	Game notes	 Giants RHP Tim Lincecum (3-2) will start Saturday night. ... The hot-hitting Scutaro is batting .485 during his streak. ... San Francisco is 31-10 against Colorado since 2011. ... The Rockies altered their starting rotation, with RHP Tyler Chatwood getting the start on Saturday and RHP Juan Nicasio being bumped back to Sunday. Chatwood joined the team from Triple-A Colorado Springs on Friday and will be added to the roster before his start.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  The Los Angeles Angels did three times better against Chris Sale than they did last Sunday at Chicago. They got three hits this time -- and still no runs.	Sale frustrated the Angels' through 7 2/3 innings with a season-high 12 strikeouts, leading the White Sox to another 3-0 victory on Friday night. Alex Rios and Adam Dunn homered, helping extend Chicago's winning streak to a season-high four games.	"I felt the same as I did the last one. I felt like I had the same stuff," Sale said. "There were more hard-hit balls, so that was the difference. I got a little bit lucky tonight.	"A team like this, they've got some amazing ballplayers. So you've got to make adjustments," he added. "It's never easy facing a team in back-to-back starts. As many adjustments as I'm making, they're going to make as well. You just put the work in, go in with determination and see how it turns out."	Sale (5-2) threw 79 of his 113 pitches for strikes in another duel with fellow lefty C.J. Wilson. In the previous one, Sale retired the first 19 batters and settled for a one-hitter -- Mike Trout's one-out single in the seventh inning -- while recording his first shutout in the major leagues.	"Sale's been on twice in a row against us, and tonight he had 12 punchouts," Wilson lamented. "It's frustrating, because I knew he's obviously a really great pitcher."	Sale extended his scoreless streak to 23 innings. It was his sixth straight start of at least seven innings while allowing fewer than three earned runs -- the longest such streak by a White Sox pitcher since a seven-game stretch by Mark Buehrle in 2007.	"You go through a team that second time, their lineup is tough enough going through it once," Chicago manager Robin Ventura said. "You do it back-to-back in a week, it's a feather in his cap and proves just how good he is. ... He wants to be in that elite group, and he's proving it."	Sale is 10-0 with a 2.55 ERA against AL West teams.	"It's nothing unbelievable. It's just deception. That's all it is," said Josh Hamilton, the only left-handed batter in the starting lineup against Sale. "Basically, the ball comes out of the second baseman and just shows up halfway to the plate, and you've got to figure out what it is and try to swing at it."	Addison Reed pitched a perfect ninth for his 14th save in 15 chances.	Wilson (3-3) lost his third straight start, allowing two runs and six hits over seven innings in his longest outing of the season.	"C.J. did a great job. I hate that we can't score runs for him," Hamilton said. "I mean, you look at the scoreboard and see how many strikes he's thrown compared to balls. He just keeps pounding the zone, so you want to score runs for a guy like that. "	This was the seventh time in his three-plus seasons as a starter that Wilson faced the same team in back-to-back starts, and only the second time he didn't get the win in the rematch.	"I pitched against them five days ago, so it's still fresh -- and I have the same notes, obviously," Wilson said. "One of the things you do is go back and look at the mistakes you made and separate them from the other pitches."	Rios drove his 10th home run to left-center with two out in the first to extend his hitting streak to 12 games, one shy of his career best in 2006 with Toronto. Paul Konerko followed with a vicious line drive back to Wilson, who caught it before spiking the ball with his glove in frustration over the homer he surrendered on an 0-2 pitch.	"I think it was the second home run I've given up this year on a ball, which is really frustrating," Wilson said. "But if you don't execute your pitch, you have nobody to blame but yourself."	Wilson gave up only three more hits until the seventh, when Dayan Viciedo singled with one out. Ventura played hit-and run with Jeff Keppinger to stay away from a potential inning-ending double play, and Viciedo pulled into second as Keppinger grounded out to third. Conor Gillaspie followed with an RBI single.	Dunn ended the scoring with his 10th homer of the season and fourth in four games against Garrett Richards in the ninth.	Game notes	 Sale's streak of consecutive innings without a walk ended at 22 2/3 in the first when he put Trout on after getting ahead of him 0-2. ... Tyler Flowers' throwing error was Chicago's 10th in nine games and AL-worst 31st this season, only one more than the Angels have. Last season, the White Sox led the majors with a franchise-record .988 fielding percentage. ... Hamilton was 0-for-3 against Sale. Left-handed hitters are 3-for-52 against him this season. ... Angels 3B Alberto Callaspo was 0-for-3 in his second career game as a DH. ... Konerko was 1-for-4, making him 7-for-30 with two homers, eight RBIs and five walks in the nine games he has started in the cleanup spot. ... The Angels got one hit over the final 5 2/3 innings, a single by No. 9 hitter Luis Jimenez that ended his 0-for-13 drought.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  No debating this home run by Adam Rosales.	After being denied a game-tying homer last week in Cleveland that Major League Baseball said the umpiring crew should have reversed, Rosales hit a go-ahead shot leading off the eighth inning after Josh Donaldson connected one inning earlier in the Oakland Athletics' 2-1 victory over the Kansas City Royals on Friday night.	"I think I was pretty sure about that one," Rosales said with an ear-to-ear grin. "It felt good to get over that hump. Every ballfield I went to, they all were saying, 'Oh, it was a homer,' or you talk to family and friends and like, 'Yeah, it was a homer.' So, now they'll be talking about something else. They'll talk about a real homer."	Sean Doolittle (3-0) pitched the eighth for the win in relief of Jarrod Parker to help the reigning AL West champions earn just their third victory in the past 11 games.	Oakland finally got to James Shields (2-4) in the late innings, nearly 10 months after he pitched a three-hit shutout here last July 31 for the Tampa Bay Rays. The right-hander matched his season high with nine strikeouts.	In Oakland's 4-3 loss May 8 in Cleveland, umpire Angel Hernandez and his crew didn't give Rosales the home run in the ninth inning after a video review -- MLB executive vice president Joe Torre said an "improper call" was made.	Rosales got over it.	"I didn't really have any sting," he said Friday.	David Lough hit an RBI double hours after his promotion from the minors, and also made a great throw to get Brandon Moss at second as he tried to stretch a leadoff single in the fourth.	Donaldson homered leading off the seventh, tying it at 1. After that drive, Shields struck out the side on called third strikes.	Rosales then sent a 1-1 pitch over the left-field wall in the eighth for his second home run.	"I knew he put a good charge into it," Parker said. "It was a no-doubter. That was a huge pickup for us."	Parker allowed four hits in seven innings, struck out five and walked two in a solid 98-pitch performance. Doolittle yielded Lough's one-out single in the eighth but was aided by an inning-ending double play. Grant Balfour finished with a perfect ninth for his seventh save in seven chances and 25th in a row dating to last season.	Parker's strong outing provided a nice lift for the A's on a day they learned lefty Opening Day starter Brett Anderson has a stress fracture in his right foot and could miss up to six weeks.	"Parker, just getting him on track, it looked like he was more confident," manager Bob Melvin said. "Hopefully, that's a springboard."	Salvador Perez hit a one-out double in the third, and Lough knocked him home two batters later. But the Royals did little else in support of Shields.	After Lorenzo Cain drew a two-out walk in the fourth, Parker retired his next eight batters in order before Cain drew another free pass in the seventh.	"It's a tough loss right there. A real tough loss," Shields said.	Lough batted leadoff and played right field after his promotion from Triple-A Omaha to take the spot of center fielder Jarrod Dyson, placed on the 15-day disabled list with a sprained right ankle.	His two-out double in the third put Kansas City ahead. The Royals lead the majors in batting average with two outs.	The Royals stumbled in the series opener after taking two of three against the Angels in Anaheim following a three-game sweep at home by the New York Yankees.	Shields has had some memorable outings in the Coliseum, most recently that gem last summer for the Rays. That came after he was tagged for a career high-tying 10 runs in four innings -- nine in the fourth frame alone -- in a 13-4 loss here on July 27, 2011, during his 16-win season.	He has just one win over his past seven starts with three losses and three no-decisions. This marked just the second outing in Shields' first nine that the opponent didn't counter with a former All-Star.	"He pitched great and he competes his heart out," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "It was combination of things tonight. Their pitcher and we couldn't get anything going."	Royals outfielder Jeff Francoeur, who last year had 20 personal pizzas delivered to a small but animated group of A's fans above right field in section 149, stopped by a "Bacon Friday" tailgate outside the ballpark. In 2011, Francoeur tossed a ball wrapped in a $100 bill into the elevated bleacher seats above his outfield spot, instructing fans to use it to buy bacon or beer.	Game notes	 Oakland OF Chris Young (strained left quadriceps) was removed from his rehab outing Thursday with Triple-A Sacramento after he experienced some cramping. Back in Oakland a day later, he worked with the strength coach on explosive bursts. He could be ready to return Saturday. "We took him out to be proactive," Melvin said. "If everything goes well today, we'll activate him tomorrow." ... This marked the first of six meetings between the clubs this year. The Royals won the 2012 season series 5-4. ... The Royals used the DL for the first time in season. ... Kansas City's Eric Hosmer ended an 0-for-10 stretch with a second-inning single. He is a .328 career hitter vs. Oakland.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN DIEGO --  Chad Tracy has two hits in 18 days. The last one cleared the veteran's troubled mind.	The pinch hitter slammed a game-winning home run in the 10th inning to give the Washington Nationals a 6-5 victory over the San Diego Padres on Friday night.	Tracy's heroics at Petco Park negated a blown save by Nationals closer Rafael Soriano, who gave up two runs with two outs in the ninth. It made a quality start from Gio Gonzalez and a two-home-run night from first baseman Adam LaRoche stand up, and reclaim a victory that seemed so certain early on.	"That one added a few gray hairs," Nationals manager Davey Johnson said. "It seemed like we had that one sewn up neat and it got away from us there at the end. I'm happy the way it turned out and happy that Chad was able to get the job done."	Tracy has owned the Padres as a pinch hitter. His seventh career pinch-hit home run was his fifth against the Padres and his third straight.	Tracy is still hitting .162, but the home run did wonders for his mentality.	"We were all fired up, myself included," Tracy said. "As a pinch hitter going through some struggles, you stay up at night in the hotel, thinking about them until youre next at-bat. The frustration builds and builds, and finally you just have to let it all go. Typically, that's when things can turn around."	Things have certainly turned around for LaRoche.	The first baseman extended his hitting streak to 14 games with a three-run shot 431 feet to deep center in the fourth and hit his second 403 feet in the sixth inning. LaRoche's second blast followed Ryan Zimmerman's home run, which just cleared the right-field wall.	It was LaRoche's 21st multihomer game, his second this season and a sign that his early-season slump is over. LaRoche hit .189 over his first 25 games but has batted .396 during his hitting streak, which includes four home runs, two doubles and 11 RBIs.	"Adam's issues have been dispelled," Johnson said. "He had a great night tonight, but he's been on fire for a couple weeks now. It's been impressive to watch him hit like his able to."	Tracy's home run came off Padres closer Huston Street (0-3), who has allowed six home runs in 17 1/3 innings. He gave up two in 39 innings last season.	"With Huston or any pitcher, if you get a ball up in the strike zone, he has a chance to get hit," Padres manager Bud Black said. "If they square it up, it has a chance to leave the ballpark. Has it happened to Huston a few times? Yes. Am I concerned? No."	The Padres tied the game with three straight singles. Chase Headley's RBI made it 5-4 and Yonder Alonso pushed him to third with another single. Kyle Blanks evened the score with another single, which sent the game into extra innings.	It was Soriano's second blown save in 14 chances, although an error by Zimmerman made both ninth-inning runs unearned. Drew Storen got his first save of the season in the 10th.	The Nationals took advantage of Padres right-hander Burch Smith, making his second professional start. The 23-year-old gave up five runs on six hits in 5 1/3 innings. He struck out eight and walked just one, but three home runs got him in trouble.	It was still an improvement over his professional debut.	Smith gave up six runs on five hits in one-plus innings in a no-decision at Tampa Bay on May 11. He pitched a perfect first, but couldn't get an out in the second and left the game with five runs in and the bases loaded.	Gonzalez got better as the game went on, and allowed three runs -- two earned -- in 6 2/3 innings. Gonzalez walked three -- two in the first inning -- struck out five, and retired 10 straight at one point. Gonzalez hasn't exceeded two earned runs in three straight starts and six of nine this season.	"I was able to make some in-game adjustments and get back on track," Gonzalez said. "It's always good when you can do that. It's also good when things go wrong in a game and the team can rally together and still get the win."	Game notes	 Washington LHP Ross Detwiler was diagnosed with an oblique strain and will miss at least one start. He was injured a start Wednesday against the Los Angeles Dodgers and had an MRI on the injury on Thursday. ... Johnson said OF Jayson Werth is still experiencing hamstring tightness and that he might not come off the 15-day disabled list when eligible on Saturday. ... The Padres placed OF Carlos Quentin on paternity leave Friday and promoted RHP Tim Stauffer from Triple-A Tucson in a corresponding move. Quentin also missed Thursday's game after the birth of his son, but he is expected back with the team on Saturday. RHP Thad Weber was designated for assignment to create room for Stauffer on the 40-man roster. ... RHP Clayton Richard, on the 15-day disabled list with a stomach virus, allowed one run in six innings of a rehab start with Triple-A Tucson. Richard is expected to make one more start before returning to the Padres rotation.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CLEVELAND --  The Cleveland Indians are finding ways to win these days even when something goes wrong.	Jason Kipnis scored the winning run in the ninth inning when Brendan Ryan's throw pulled catcher Jesus Montero off the plate, sending the Indians to a 5-4 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Saturday.	Cleveland pulled out the win after closer Chris Perez allowed two-out solo homers to Raul Ibanez and Justin Smoak that tied the score in the top of the ninth.	"We made it more exciting than it needed to be, but there is something to be said for being resilient," Indians manager Terry Francona said. "Rather than feeling sorry for yourself when you get punched in the gut, we came back to win."	Kipnis, who won Friday's game with a three-run homer in the 10th, sparked the winning rally with a leadoff single against Oliver Perez (1-1). He moved to third on Asdrubal Cabrera's double and Nick Swisher was walked intentionally to load the bases.	Mark Reynolds then hit a sharp ground ball that forced Ryan to make a diving stop, and he was unable to get the forceout at home.	"That was a very uneventful walkoff, but a win is a win," Reynolds said. "I just tried to put the ball in play somewhere. When I hit it I said to myself, `please get through,' then it was `please make a bad throw,' and Then `please get there.' "	Reynolds hit his 12th homer and finished with three RBIs as the Indians won for the 16th time in their last 20 games.	"That's baseball," Reynolds said. "We were like, `Oh well, let's go win it in the ninth. If not, we've got a good bullpen."	After Kipnis scampered home to end the game, Mariners manager Eric Wedge came on the field to discuss the call with home plate umpire Mike Winters. He quickly went back to the dugout.	"The throw beat him, but Monty came off the plate early," Wedge said. "You have to stand on the plate. You have to, but he came out a little bit early. We got the ground ball we wanted -- Ryno made a great play -- but we didn't get it done."	Chris Perez (2-0) retired the first two hitters before Ibanez homered to right, cutting the lead to 4-3. Smoak then homered to center on a 1-1 pitch.	"The one to Ibanez was a mistake," Perez said. "I missed my spot terribly. The one to Smoak, I was trying to throw it on the corner but I missed high. It's frustrating, but it's not one of the worst games I've ever had."	It was Perez's second blown save in eight chances this season and wasted a strong start by Zach McAllister, who allowed two runs and six hits in 7 1/3 innings.	Reynolds singled in a run in the first against Joe Saunders and drove a 3-2 pitch over the 19-foot high wall in left field in the fifth. Reynolds, signed as a free agent in December, is tied for the AL lead in home runs.	Michael Bourn and Kipnis each singled in a run in the sixth, but Ryan belted a two-run homer in the eighth to keep Seattle in the game.	Saunders allowed four runs and 11 hits in 5 1/3 innings, continuing his road woes. The left-hander is 0-4 with an 11.25 ERA in five starts away from Safeco Field this season, compared to 3-0 with an 0.94 ERA in four home starts.	Asked about his problems pitching away from home, Saunders said, "I'm gonna sacrifice a chicken before my next road start. ... This is just kind of a fluky thing."	The Indians and Mariners exchanged baserunning blunders in the middle innings.	Montero hit a leadoff single in the third and moved to second on Ryan's base hit with no outs. But Montero strayed too far from second when Endy Chavez took a strike while squaring around for a bunt attempt. He was tagged out in a rundown and McAllister retired the next two hitters.	Cabrera committed his own baserunning mistake after he led off the fifth with a single. Ibanez caught Swisher's high fly ball in front of the wall in left. Cabrera, thinking the ball was going to be for extra bases, was doubled off first.	The Indians chased Saunders in the sixth. Mike Aviles started the inning with a double and remained at second when Yan Gomes singled through the left side. After a sacrifice and with the infield playing in, Ryan fielded Bourn's ground ball behind the mound but his throw home was too late to get Aviles. Kipnis then blooped a single to left that scored Gomes.	Smoak led off the eighth with a double and scored when Ryan connected for his first homer of the season. Rich Hill recorded the final two outs of the eighth for Cleveland.	Game notes	 Mariners RHP Felix Hernandez (5-2) takes on RHP Justin Masterson (6-2) in a matchup of aces Sunday. Hernandez was forced to leave his start against the New York Yankees on Tuesday with back stiffness. ... Indians OF Michael Brantley, hitless in his last seven at-bats, wasn't in the lineup. Aviles started in left field. Brantley came in as a defensive replacement in the eighth. ... Mariners OF Michael Morse returned after missing Friday's game with irritation in his eye and was hitless in four at-bats. ... Mariners RHP Aaron Harang (lower back stiffness) played catch before the game and will throw a bullpen session Sunday. Harang was a late scratch Thursday against the Yankees, but is scheduled to make his next start Tuesday at the Angels. ... Cleveland Browns coach Rob Chudzinski threw out the first pitch and also exchanged uniforms with Indians manager Terry Francona.

NEW YORK --  Yankees manager Joe Girardi has proved to be quite adept at lineup juggling and position shuffling during an injury plagued first two months. Still, there's one player he thinks he would be unable to do without: Robinson Cano.	The All-Star second baseman hit a pair of two-run homers to back a solid effort by David Phelps, and New York beat the Toronto Blue Jays for the ninth straight time at Yankee Stadium, 7-2 Saturday.	"I'm glad that's not a moving part," Girardi said. "He's not someone you can replace."	Phelps (2-2) struck out eight while allowing one run in a season-high seven innings, helping New York beat the Blue Jays for the eighth time in nine games this season.	Cano connected off Brandon Morrow with two outs in the third after Brett Gardner drove in the first run of the game with an RBI single. Cano also hit one off Morrow (1-3) with two away in the fifth, a shot that gave him his second multihomer game of the year. He has 12 such games for his career.	"I felt like I threw a lot better than what the scoreboard indicated," Morrow said, "but just that, you know, New York's Robinson Cano, he was the whole ballgame."	Travis Hafner returned to the Yankees' lineup after missing five games because of right shoulder inflammation and hit a two-run homer in the eighth inning.	The AL East's top team will send ace CC Sabathia to the mound Sunday with a chance to complete its second sweep of Toronto in the Bronx in three weeks. The Yankees took four straight from April 25-28. The Blue Jays counter with NL Cy Young Award winner R.A. Dickey.	Toronto has lost 23 of its last 28 games at Yankee Stadium.	"Yankee Stadium is always a tough place to play, regardless," Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. "They've taken it to us pretty good here."	Making his fourth start in place of the injured Ivan Nova, Phelps was at his best with runners on base. In the first, he walked Jose Bautista and Edwin Encarnacion but picked Bautista off second base and struck out J.P. Arencibia to end the inning. With runners on first and second in the third, Phelps got Melky Cabrera to ground into a double play. After again walking Bautista, he struck out Encarnacion with a high fastball for the third out.	The Blue Jays cut the lead to 3-1 in the fourth. After Adam Lind had the first of his two doubles, Colby Rasmus hit a sharp liner that Curtis Granderson, playing right field for the first time in his big league career, got spun around on and Lind scored. But Phelps struck out Maicer Izturis to limit the damage.	"I was making pitches when I needed to," Phelps said. "I was all over the place today."	Phelps was greeted on the field just in front of the dugout with a handshake from Girardi after a 1-2-3 seventh. Phelps yielded six hits and walked three.	David Robertson gave up Encarnacion's 12th homer in a rainy eighth inning.	Morrow had his start pushed back from Wednesday because of neck and back tightness, and the rest appeared to have served him well early. He retired six in a row before Jayson Nix singled to start the third.	With two outs, Gardner singled to center field and third base coach Rob Thomson signaled Nix home with a feverish windmill of his right arm. Nix slid in before the throw arrived.	Cano then sent the next pitch on the shortest possible journey out of the ballpark, just clearing the fence down the right-field line. Cano hit his 12th of the year in the fifth with a no-doubter to right-center, driving in Austin Romine, who singled.	"That was a good game," Cano said.	Morrow was lifted after throwing 75 pitches in five innings. He allowed seven hits and five runs.	Game notes	 Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner, at the stadium for fan photo day, said he was pleasantly surprised but "not shocked" by New York's early success, considering all the injuries. ...  New York acquired INF Reid Brignac from Colorado for cash. He was recently designated for assignment by the Rockies. ... Gibbons said LHP J.A. Happ (skull fracture, knee) is still sidelined because of the knee injury he sustained when he fell to the turf after being hit in the head by a line drive and is not near pitching again. Gibbons said Happ's head is fine. ... Blue Jays RHP Josh Johnson (triceps) will make his first rehab start on Monday for Class-A Dunedin. ... Cabrera doubled for the fifth straight game, a career high.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

CHICAGO --  The Chicago Cubs got another strong performance from Scott Feldman on Saturday, and Matt Garza is set to return to the mound on Tuesday.	One of the worst teams in the NL Central has one of the league's best rotations.	Feldman pitched shutout ball into the seventh inning and drove in two runs with a big two-out double, helping the Cubs to an 8-2 victory over the New York Mets.	The Cubs have won five of seven and can win three straight series for the first time with a victory on Sunday. Anthony Rizzo had two hits and his first home run since signing a seven-year contract on Monday.	Chicago announced before the game that Garza will come off the disabled list to pitch Tuesday in Pittsburgh, with Carlos Villanueva shuffling to the bullpen. Garza, who had 15 wins with Tampa Bay in 2010, has been out all season with a strained lat muscle.	"If these guys keep throwing the ball the way they have the first six weeks and with Garza coming back, you don't expect a whole lot right away," Cubs manager Dale Sveum said. "But once he gets settled in, it's got a chance to be pretty nice, if not one of the top rotations in the league right now."	The Cubs (18-24) were going for their first shutout since a victory over Colorado on Aug. 26, but Rick Ankiel broke it up with a two-run homer off Hector Rondon with one out in the ninth.	Feldman (4-3) allowed seven hits, struck out six and walked one in 6 2/3 innings. The right-hander improved to 4-0 with a 1.27 ERA in five games since he lost each of his first three starts in his first year with the Cubs.	"I feel healthy, my arm feels good. Mechanically everything feels a lot better than it did in spring training," Feldman said. "Just keep working on that stuff and try and keep it that way for the rest of the season here."	Feldman lifted the Cubs to 26 quality starts, tied with Washington for third in the NL. Chicago's starters also have held opponents to a .226 average, which actually went up a point Saturday.	Besides Feldman, Travis Wood has opened the season with eight consecutive quality starts and Jeff Samardzija has 64 strikeouts through nine starts.	"It's awesome, it's a good feeling. We got Garza coming back and hopefully he just fits right in and gels like the rest of the staff," Rizzo said. "We know if we go and score some runs, we're going to be in the game and have a chance to win."	Mets starter Jeremy Hefner lost his fifth straight decision to start the season. Hefner (0-5) was charged with four runs and five hits in four innings in his shortest start since he pitched four innings against Washington on April 20.	"I wouldn't say it's weighing on me," Hefner said of his winless start. "I want to win, I want the team to win and obviously we didn't do that today. Got to make some adjustments and be better in the next one."	New York, which was trying to win three straight games for the second time this season, squandered a couple of chances to get off to a fast start.	The Mets put runners on the corners in the first when Ike Davis flied out for the second out. David Wright then stole second, but David DeJesus hauled in Lucas Duda's fly ball to deep left-center at the wall to end the inning.	New York had runners on second and third again in the second, but Mike Baxter popped out to shortstop to end the inning.	Chicago then scored four times in the fourth inning. Luis Valbuena had a sacrifice fly and Welington Castillo singled in Alfonso Soriano. After Darwin Barney flied out for the second out, Feldman came up with a two-run double to give the Cubs a 4-0 lead.	Rizzo tacked on his 10th homer in the fifth and Nate Schierholtz went deep in Chicago's three-run eighth inning.	"Whenever you get an opportunity to get runs, you gotta seize those opportunities," Rizzo said. "It was good to get the big inning there, then towards the end with the insurance runs. That's what we need to do."	Daniel Murphy went 2 for 4 for New York and is batting .500 (14 for 28) in his last seven games. But Davis continued to struggle, going 0 for 4 to fall to 4 for 39 over his last 11 games.	Davis said he spoke to general manager Sandy Alderson, who told him he wasn't getting sent down in the near future.	"As long as I keep cool, start having good at-bats and start performing better it won't happen," Davis said.	Game notes	 Saturday was the 700th game between the Mets and Cubs. Chicago leads the series 352-348. ... Rizzo's home run off Robert Carson was his fourth against left-handed pitching, matching his total from last season. ... The Mets are appealing to Major League Baseball to get the second earned run charged Friday to Matt Harvey changed to an unearned run. ... Baxter started in right field for the Mets instead of Jordany Valdespin. Mets manager Terry Collins said he made the decision because Baxter was better at facing an off-speed pitcher like Feldman. ... The Cubs haven't lost a series to the Mets at Wrigley Field since 2007. ... Sunday's pitching matchup is the Mets' Dillon Gee (2-5, 6.13 ERA) against Wood (4-2, 2.03 ERA).	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

BALTIMORE --  The Tampa Bay Rays don't seem to mind being behind late in the game.	In fact, they're becoming quite adept at staging stirring rallies.	Matt Joyce hit a go-ahead two-run double in a six-run ninth inning that lifted the Rays to a 10-6 victory over the Orioles on Saturday, ending Baltimore's franchise-record streak of 109 straight wins when leading after seven innings.	"That's kind of been our identity from the beginning of the year," Rays third baseman Evan Longoria said. "We've really done a good job throughout the game of continuing to tack on runs, and even when we've been down early in games, finding a way to put together good at-bats and score runs."	Joyce also homered and finished 3 for 5 with five RBIs for the Rays, who posted a season-best third straight road victory, all of them come-from-behind wins.	"We believe in each other, and then you're able to do those things," Rays manager Joe Maddon said. "If you stop believing, if you don't think it can't happen, then it never will. If you think it can happen, then it shall. And that's pretty much what this group's been about."	But this one came against a closer that had been virtually unbeatable until this week and a team that's been hard to overcome when taking a lead to the eighth.	"Their track record after seven innings has spoken for itself," Longoria said. "They've been really good late in the game. And Jim Johnson has been as good as they come. To be able to get to him and then tack a couple more on and be able to win a game like that, especially here in this hostile environment, is really big."	Trailing 6-4, Kelly Johnson hit a one-out homer off the Orioles' Jim Johnson (1-4), whose club-record streak of 35 straight saves ended Tuesday.	Johnson then loaded the bases on two walks and a hit before Joyce hit a two-run double to the right-center gap for a 7-6 lead. Ben Zobrist followed with a two-run double off Darren O'Day, who later issued a bases-loaded walk to Luke Scott.	After two straight blown saves, Johnson wasn't questioning himself or talking about a slump. In fact, he knew exactly what went wrong and vowed to fix it.	"Not getting strike one is a good place to start," Johnson said. "Pitching behind, just not throwing quality pitches. It kind of snowballed back and didn't obviously make the pitch I needed to. It's just one of those days where it just didn't work."	Adam Jones and Chris Davis homered for the Orioles, who have lost a season-high four straight.	"We're not clicking great right now, but unfortunately you go through little spells in a season like we play," Baltimore left fielder Nate McLouth said. "Like I said, there's no sense of sitting here and beating yourselves up about it. Wipe it clean and try to get it done tomorrow."	Alex Torres (1-0) worked four hitless innings for the victory.	The Orioles sent 10 men to the plate in the first inning and took a 4-0 lead against Roberto Hernandez.	McLouth led off with a single, moved to second on a groundout and scored when Nick Markakis doubled over the head of Joyce. Jones then ripped a line drive homer to left off an 0-2 pitch and Davis followed with a shot to left-center.	Jair Jurrjens, whose contract was purchased before the game from Triple-A Norfolk, retired the first seven hitters he faced before allowing successive doubles to Jose Molina and Yunel Escobar. Molina's ball bounced off the top of the wall in center, prompting Maddon to seek a video review, which upheld the original call.	Later in the third, Joyce hit a two-run homer onto the flag court in right field, his seventh of the season, cutting the deficit to 4-3.	Hernandez departed after hitting Davis with a pitch to lead off the bottom of the third. The right-hander allowed five runs and eight hits in two-plus innings, with nine of the 14 batters he faced reaching base.	Reliever Cesar Ramos struck out Matt Wieters swinging, but gave up a run-scoring double to J.J. Hardy for a 5-3 Orioles lead.	In the fourth, McLouth led off with a single, stole second, moved to third on Markakis' single to center and scored on Jones' broken-bat fielder's choice grounder.	The Rays got within 6-4 in the fifth, but lost Molina in the process. Molina pulled up with a tight left hamstring after a leadoff double and was replaced by Jose Lobaton, who scored on Joyce's two-out double.	Jurrjens gave up four runs and six hits -- all for extra bases -- over five innings.	Game notes	 After the game, the Orioles optioned 2B Ryan Flaherty to Norfolk. A corresponding move will be announced Sunday. ... Hardy has hit in 13 straight games. ... Longoria doubled in the ninth, extending his hitting streak to 12 games, matching his career high. ... When Jurrjens made his major league debut on Aug. 15, 2007, at Cleveland, he was opposed by Hernandez, then known as Fausto Carmona. ... Hernandez failed to go 5 1/3 innings for the first time in eight 2013 starts. He walked none and struck out one. ... The Orioles also recalled RHP Jake Arrieta from Norfolk, optioned RHP Alex Burnett to Triple-A, placed OF Nolan Reimold (right hamstring strain) on the 15-day DL and moved 2B Brian Roberts to the 60-day DL. ... Hall of Fame third baseman Brooks Robinson turned 76 on Saturday. ... Maddon said RHP Jake Odorizzi will start Monday, taking the turn of injured LHP David Price. The Rays will make a roster move to add Odorizzi to the 25-man roster Sunday.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  The Los Angeles Angels finally won a game that Joe Blanton started for them. That will have to be enough for Blanton while he remains in search of the first victory for his record.	Alberto Callaspo hit a three-run homer in a five-run seventh inning, and the Angels beat the White Sox 12-9 on Saturday to end Chicago's four-game winning streak.	Callaspo also had a pair of sacrifice flies to give him five RBIs on the day. Mark Trumbo added his 10th homer for the Angels, who finished with a season-high 17 hits less than 24 hours after Chris Sale shut them down for the second time in six days with a 3-0 win.	"No game is ugly. It's just a game, no matter how you win it or how you lose it," Angels slugger Albert Pujols said. "I mean, you look at their ballclub and there's no easy out on their side, either. But when we get it going, we're a pretty good ballclub and we can score runs at any time in the game."	Robert Coello (1-0) recorded his first major league victory, retiring all five batters he faced and striking out three after another ineffective performance by Blanton.	"Those were five huge outs to get in the middle of the game, and we need that kind of contribution from our bullpen," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "He's got a really good out pitch, he's got life on his fastball, and he throws strikes. That's a good combination."	Hector Gimenez had four hits and three RBIs for the White Sox, who allowed only 10 runs during their winning streak. Paul Konerko and Alexei Ramirez had three hits apiece, and Adam Dunn drove in two runs before leaving in the fifth because of back spasms.	"I felt it in the on-deck circle before my last at-bat," Dunn said. "I was going through my same stretching routine, and when I came up it just grabbed. I didn't take any warm-up swings. I don't think I've ever had a back spasm before, and I didn't really know what it was. My big concern after that was defensively. I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to get down to get a ground ball -- or even worse, get up to do something with it. It never did loosen up."	Chicago was only down by one before Los Angeles broke it open in the seventh against Donnie Veal, who was just recalled from Triple-A Charlotte. Callaspo greeted the left-hander with a drive to left for his third homer, and No. 9 hitter J.B. Shuck made it 10-4 with a two-run double.	Nate Jones (0-4), who came in after Hector Santiago was knocked out in the fourth, allowed four runs and three hits in 3 1/3 innings. Veal was charged with the same totals while recording just one out.	The White Sox got back in the game with five runs in the eighth, including a three-run shot by Gimenez off closer Ernesto Frieri. Konerko and Dayan Viciedo each had an RBI single Garrett Richards.	But Los Angeles gave Frieri a couple of insurance runs in the bottom half on Howie Kendrick's RBI single and Callaspo's second sacrifice fly, and the right-hander struck out the side in the ninth to get his eighth save in nine attempts.	Blanton gave up four runs and 11 hits in 4 1/3 innings. He is 0-7 with a 6.62 ERA in his first nine starts with the Angels, who signed him to a two-year, $15 million contract in December.	"I went as hard as I could for as long as I could," Blanton said. "I was just trying to keep putting up as many zeros as possible and keep making pitches."	Coello came on with the bases loaded and one out in the fifth and struck out Ramirez and Alex Rios. The Angels grabbed a 5-4 lead in the bottom half on Trumbo's RBI double and Callaspo's sacrifice fly. Pujols started the rally with an opposite-field double down the first base line against the shift.	"I just closed my eyes when I hit that ball and it went past the bag," Pujols joked. "I know I can hit the ball the other way anytime I want to. Obviously, when they do that, they try to get in your brain and think you're going to change your swing. But you can't do that. You have to stick with it. You have to see the ball and just put your best swing on it."	Santiago was charged with three runs and four hits in 3 1/3 innings. He issued a season-high four walks and struck out two.	Blanton, who has allowed a major league-worst 86 hits, gave up a pair of singles in each of the first three innings. In the first, he escaped unscathed by striking out Dunn and Konerko. In the second, he fielded a high chopper by Dewayne Wise and threw him out. In the third, Blanton got out of the jam by striking out Conor Gillaspie with his 50th pitch.	"He made a couple of pitches to limit the damage and keep his team in it. Then their offense came alive and it turned out to be kind of a slugfest," Konerko said. "It was a long tough game and a tough one to lose. But the guys had some good at-bats."	Game notes	 Callaspo came within one RBI of tying his career best, set on April 18, 2010, at Minnesota while playing for Kansas City. ... Angels RF Josh Hamilton was in Scioscia's original lineup, but got scratched with no other explanation than a day off to recharge, according to a club spokesman. Hamilton hit for Brendan Harris in the seventh and singled to bring his average up to .214. ... Hamilton was replaced defensively by Trumbo -- who had been slotted as the designated hitter. Instead, Pujols was shifted from 1B to DH and Harris was inserted at 1B.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

PHILADELPHIA --  Bronson Arroyo has these Philadelphia Phillies all figured out.	Arroyo pitched five-hit ball over 7 2/3 innings, Joey Votto was 4 for 4 with a homer, and the Cincinnati Reds beat the Phillies 10-0 Saturday.	Arroyo (4-4) struck out six and allowed one runner to reach third in winning his third straight start against Philadelphia. He was 1-7 in his first 10 games against the Phillies, but is 3-0 with a 1.52 ERA in three starts against them since last Aug. 22.	"This game is so funny," Arroyo said. "One pitch can surely change things. I've been able to keep their power guys quiet so that's helped."	Votto had a two-run shot and walked twice to reach safely six times. Ryan Hanigan hit a three-run homer.	"I'm trying to see the ball as long as possible and direct it where I want it," Votto said.	Kyle Kendrick (4-2) gave up four runs and eight hits with a season-high four walks in six innings. Kendrick hadn't allowed more than two runs in his previous seven starts.	Cincinnati won for the seventh time in its past eight games and improved to 4-1 against the Phillies this year.	Arroyo entered with a 6.00 career ERA against the Phillies, including a 9.60 ERA in three starts at Citizens Bank Park.	"We used to hit him good," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said. "The last three times, he's pitched us the same. He's pitched us backwards, slow hooks and change-ups. He's given us fits."	Todd Frazier led off the second with an infield single, snapping an 0-for-19 slump. Donald Lutz followed with a single. Then Hanigan connected for his first extra-base hit of the season, giving the Reds a 3-0 lead. Hanigan had eight singles in 54 at-bats before taking Kendrick deep to left.	Hanigan was hit by a pitch leading off the sixth. He advanced on a sacrifice and scored on Zack Cozart's two-out double to right to make it 4-0.	The Reds added four runs off three relievers in the eighth. Votto hit one out in the ninth.	Arroyo didn't need all that support. He baffled hitters with his assortment of slow stuff, occasionally mixing a fastball with his mid-70s off-speed pitches.	"Arroyo pitched masterfully," Reds manager Dusty Baker said. "It was still close before our offense exploded at the end."	The Phillies have been shut out six times in 43 games, matching their total from all of last season.	"They say the game builds character," Manuel said. "I don't know about building, but it definitely reveals it."	For Kendrick, it was his worst outing since allowing five runs in Philadelphia's home opener. Kendrick has been Philadelphia's most consistent starter this season, posting a 2.82 ERA and outperforming Cole Hamels, Cliff Lee and Roy Halladay.	Since returning to the rotation last August, Kendrick is 11-6 with a 3.02 ERA in 21 starts.	"My command wasn't good and I fell behind a lot," Kendrick said. "It was a tough day all around."	Game notes	Carlos Zambrano had five strikeouts in two innings in his first appearance in an extended spring training game since the three-time All-Star signed a minor league deal with the Phillies. ... Injured Phillies LHP John Lannan threw a bullpen session and is expected to throw again Monday. ...  Reds RF Jay Bruce extended his hitting streak to nine games. ... The Reds optioned LHP Tony Cingrani to Triple-A Louisville and recalled INF Neftali Soto. ... Phillies CF John Mayberry Jr. struck out swinging four times. ... Reds third base coach Chris Speier got cheers for planting a kiss on the Phillie Phanatic while the furry green mascot was pretending to be Alicia Keys singing "Girl on Fire" before the sixth inning. ... Homer Bailey (2-3, 3.51 ERA) opposes Philadelphia's Jonathan Pettibone (3-0, 3.41 ERA) in the series finale Sunday afternoon.	---	Follow Rob Maaddi on Twitter: https://twitter.com/RobMaaddi	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.

PITTSBURGH -- The Houston Astros haven't had many wins to celebrate so far this season. This one was especially satisfying for manager Bo Porter.	Jason Castro led off the 11th inning with a double and scored the go-ahead run on a close play at the plate as the Astros topped the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-2 on Saturday night.	"Even though we've had our share of bumps and bruises, we're going to hit a stretch where we start playing well and put together a string of games like we played tonight," Porter said. "It's a tremendous group of guys in that clubhouse. It's a resilient group. They have fun together. They love playing game. They play hard."	Castro doubled off the top of the center-field fence against Bryan Morris (1-2), and Carlos Pena was intentionally walked one out later. The runners moved up on a wild pitch and Castro scored when he beat second baseman Neil Walker's throw home on Matt Dominguez's fielder's choice grounder.	Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle argued the call with plate umpire C.B. Bucknor and was ejected. Pinch-hitter J.D. Martinez followed with an RBI single to make it 4-2.	"I thought he was out, but I watched the replay and I was wrong. C.B. got the call right," Hurdle said.	Porter credited good baserunning on Castro's part for scoring the winning run.	"Castro had a great heads-up read on contact and made a great slide," Porter said.	Rookie Jose Cisnero (1-0) struck out five in 3 2/3 scoreless relief innings for his first major league win. Jose Veras pitched a scoreless 11th for his sixth save as Houston (12-31) won for the second time in three games since losing six in a row.	"Anytime you get that kind of push like that from someone out of the bullpen, he probably should have got the win and the save, too," Hurdle said.	Porter was hoping Cisnero could provide multiple innings from a bullpen that has been overworked of late.	"In that situation, we have some guys who have been worked hard the last few days," Porter said. "We didn't have many guys available. Most of the guys we had (warming) up were for show. It was pretty his game until we took the lead and then we were going to hand it over to Veras."	Chris Carter's run-scoring single in the eighth inning tied the game at 2 and ended Mark Melancon's string of 13 consecutive scoreless relief appearances, covering 13 innings.	Houston's Jose Altuve had three hits to raise his batting average to .342 after being activated from the bereavement list before the game. Altuve missed three games after his grandmother died in his native Venezuela.	Andrew McCutchen hit two doubles and Brandon Inge had two hits for Pittsburgh, which lost for the second time in nine games.	Pittsburgh starter A.J. Burnett held Houston to one run in seven innings while allowing five hits and four walks, but wound up with a no-decision when Melancon could not hold the lead. Burnett struck out seven to raise his National League-leading total to 79. He has not allowed more than three earned runs in any of his 10 starts this season.	"You can talk about (the Astros') record, but they're all big leaguers, they're all up here for a reason," Burnett said. "They battled me. They had some really good swings with two strikes and they fought off some tough pitches. I felt good to get out of it with only one run allowed."	The Astros' Erik Bedard gave up two runs and seven hits in six innings with three strikeouts and no walks in his first career start against Pittsburgh. The veteran left-hander was the Pirates' Opening Day starter last season, but was released on Aug. 30 after going 7-14.	"You don't really think about who it's against," Bedard said. "You just want to win the ballgame."	Inge put Pittsburgh in front 2-1 in the sixth when he hit a two-out RBI single to left field off Bedard.	The Pirates scored the game's first run on consecutive doubles by McCutchen and Gaby Sanchez with two outs in the first inning.	Houston tied in the fifth on Altuve's two-out RBI single.	Game notes	Houston INF Jake Elmore was optioned to Triple-A Oklahoma City to make room on the roster for Altuve. ... Porter said Saturday that OF Brandon Barnes, his best defensive outfielder, was unavailable to play in Friday night's 5-4 loss to Pittsburgh because of a sprained right ankle. That is why RF Jimmy Paredes, who dropped Pittsburgh C Russell Martin's two-out fly ball in the ninth inning to allow the winning run to score, was in the game. On Saturday, Barnes entered in the bottom of the 11th for defensive purposes. ... Pirates RHP Jeff Karstens (right shoulder inflammation) allowed two unearned runs in four innings Saturday night for Double-A Altoona in a rehab start at Richmond in the Eastern League. ... The three-game series concludes Sunday with Houston RHP Lucas Harrell (3-4, 5.11) pitching against LHP Jeff Locke (3-1, 3.15).	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MINNEAPOLIS --  David Ortiz insists he isn't trying to do anything special to show the Minnesota Twins they made a big mistake by letting him go in 2002.	It just looks that way every time he crushes another ball into the Target Field seats.	Ortiz homered twice and drove in six runs to torment his former team once again, leading the Boston Red Sox to a 12-5 victory over the Minnesota Twins on Saturday night.	"It used to be," Ortiz said when asked if there was extra motivation when he played the Twins. "Not anymore. I just go about my business. I try to hit the moon every time I go to hit anywhere. It's not new."	Dustin Pedroia had two hits, two walks and an RBI, extending his hitting streak to 10 games. Daniel Nava also went deep for the Red Sox, who have won four straight following a slide in which they had lost 10 of 14.	Scott Diamond (3-4) gave up six runs on eight hits and walked three in 4 1/3 innings for the Twins, who have lost four in a row to fall into last place in the AL Central. Pedro Florimon had two hits and two RBIs and Joe Mauer extended his hitting streak to 15 games with two hits.	Craig Breslow (1-0) pitched 1 2/3 innings of scoreless relief for the win. Ortiz also had a single and a walk, raising his batting average to .362 in a game that lasted 3 hours, 53 minutes.	"His performance is as good as you're going to find in the league right now," Red Sox manager John Farrell said.	Twins general manager Terry Ryan has long been one of the most respected executives in the game. But one of his biggest mistakes came in 2002 when he released Ortiz, who had just appeared to start putting things together in his sixth big league season. The move is still haunting Ryan and the Twins 11 years later.	Ortiz signed with the Red Sox, and promptly blossomed into one of the most feared hitters in the American League, a central figure in Boston's two World Series championships and the kind of slugger the Twins have been searching for ever since. He wears No. 34 in honor of the late Kirby Puckett and seems to take particular delight in hammering his former team.	Ortiz is 19 for 37 with five homers and 16 RBIs at Target Field.	"The one guy we say don't let beat us is David Ortiz," Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said. "They've got a lot of really good hitters over there, but we told them to stay away from this guy, don't give in to him. And he keeps sending souvenirs."	Diamond labored from the start, falling behind 3-0 after 19 pitches. Ortiz jumped on a flat slider and drove it into the seats in right-center field for his sixth homer of the season.	Red Sox starter Ryan Dempster wasn't much better. He walked four hitters in the second and third innings to load the bases in both frames, but the right-hander got Mauer to chase a breaking ball down and away to escape in the second and then got Aaron Hicks to fly out to deep right field to end the third.	Dempster needed a staggering 127 pitches to get through just 4 2/3 innings. He gave up five runs on eight hits and walked six.	"I just couldn't get consistency with any of my pitches," Dempster said. "I kept missing away with it. I really didn't have any of my pitches tonight."	Down 7-5 in the sixth, the Twins loaded the bases again. But Pedroia made a nifty over-the-shoulder catch in shallow right field, then whirled and easily threw out Ryan Doumit at home on a major base-running blunder.	Ortiz and Nava busted the game open with two-run homers in the seventh, giving Ortiz his 40th career multi-homer game.	"He's swinging the bat great right now," Pedroia said. "Everything he hits is hard. He looks great up there."	Game notes	 The Red Sox played without OFs Shane Victorino and Stephen Drew because of back injuries. Farrell said both were hopeful of playing on Sunday. ... Mauer returned to the lineup after missing Friday night with a stiff back. ... Diamond and Dempster were facing each other for the second time this season, becoming the first pair of Canadian starters to meet more than once in a season since at least 1920, according to the Red Sox. ... The Twins will send LHP Pedro Hernandez (2-0, 5.79) to the mound on Sunday for the finale against Boston RHP John Lackey (1-4, 4.05). Lackey is looking to bounce back from a poor start against Tampa Bay, when he gave up five runs in 4 1/3 innings.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ATLANTA --  The Braves already knew rookie Evan Gattis is an impressive power hitter. He's also proving a quick learner.	Gattis took advantage of some last-second tips from teammate Justin Upton before hitting a go-ahead, two-run homer off Kenley Jansen in the eighth inning, and the Atlanta Braves rallied to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 3-1 on Saturday night.	Andrelton Simmons followed Gattis with another homer off Jansen after each listened to quick reminders from Upton on the right-hander's signature cutters.	"I remembered (Upton) said something about (Jansen) in the advance meeting, so I wanted to go to him to see what I could get," Gattis said. "Whatever I could get in an at-bat like that was going to help."	Gattis said Upton's advice was to avoid cutters that appeared to be bound for the middle of the plate, because they would break off the plate. Gattis said Upton's instruction was to wait on a pitch "starting at you, or it looks like it's starting at you. That's going to be the one that you want."	Gattis fouled off two cutters before hitting the line-drive homer.	Jansen (1-2) said Gattis "just hit a good pitch."	"What could I do?" Jansen asked. "I'm not going to let that bother me. Tip your hat. He hit a good pitch. You've got to go in there. Period. He's creeping up on home plate every time I'm throwing outside. I put it where I wanted to put it."	Gattis has eight homers and ranks third in the majors with six game-winning RBIs.	"Awesome," said Simmons of Gattis. "He's awesome. Just amazing. That's all you can say. Pretty much you saw it coming, but just seeing it is awesome. He's a great hitter. He's always ready to go and he's fun to watch."	Gattis, primarily a catcher, also has played left field and first base. The recent returns of catcher Brian McCann and right fielder Jason Heyward from the disabled list may make it difficult for Gattis to find regular playing time, but he said he enjoys pinch-hitting.	Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez sees a benefit in having Gattis available as a pinch-hitter.	"He likes these moments, it seems like," Gonzalez said. "It's almost better that you can put him in anywhere you want, but sooner or later we've got to get him three or four at-bats."	Kris Medlen, Cory Gearrin, and Craig Kimbrel combined on a two-hitter for Atlanta.	Chris Capuano led 1-0 before he allowed a one-out single to B.J. Upton in the eighth. Dodgers manager Don Mattingly brought in Jansen (1-2), the hard-throwing right-hander, to face Gattis even though Capuano had allowed just five hits and thrown only 91 pitches.	"I'm not going to let him lose that game," Mattingly said of Capuano.	Capuano said he told Mattingly after his last at-bat in the eighth inning to be prepared to pull him out of the game because he had lingering problems with a strained calf.	"It wasn't affecting pitch execution out there," Capuano said. "It just feels a little tired. I've got an extra day before the next start. With treatment and stuff we should be able to get that ready."	Gearrin (1-0) pitched a scoreless eighth in relief of Medlen, who gave up two hits and one unearned run in seven innings. Kimbrel pitched a perfect ninth for his 13th save.	The Dodgers, who have lost two straight to the Braves after winning four of five, scored their only run in the fourth. Adrian Gonzalez walked and scored on Skip Schumaker's double to the left-field corner and left fielder Justin Upton's fielding error. Schumaker wasn't given an RBI.	The only other hit allowed by Medlen was a second-inning single by Tim Federowicz.	"Medlen was outstanding," Gonzalez said. "He was ready for one of these games. You saw seven innings of him being the Medlen of last year."	Chris Johnson had three hits for the Braves, who won after finding themselves in a sudden bullpen crisis.	Before the game, Braves general manager Frank Wren said an MRI revealed a tear in Eric O'Flaherty's left ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow. O'Flaherty was placed on the disabled list and could face season-ending surgery.	On Thursday, left-hander Jonny Venters had Tommy John surgery for the second time, ending his season. On Friday, right-hander Jordan Walden was placed on the 15-day disabled list because of shoulder inflammation.	Medlen, who had been 0 for 13 this season, had a brief celebration in the third inning when he had a bloop single for his first hit. Standing and smiling on first base, Medlen lifted his hands to the sky before giving first-base coach Terry Pendleton a hug.	Dodgers center fielder Matt Kemp leaped and reached over the wall to take a home run away from Heyward in the first inning. Heyward took off his helmet while crossing second base. Just when it appeared he might toss the headgear in disgust, Heyward instead lifted the helmet toward Kemp in a gesture of respect.	Game notes	 The Braves called up RHP Cory Rasmus from Triple-A Gwinnett to take O'Flaherty's roster spot. Rasmus, 25, is the younger brother of Toronto OF Colby Rasmus. ... Medlen lowered his ERA to 3.02. ... Dodgers 2B Mark Ellis, on the disabled list because of a strained right quad, will join the team in Atlanta on Sunday and fly with the team to Milwaukee. .. Mattingly said LHP Ted Lilly (strained right rib cage) will come off the DL soon, but not necessarily to start. ... The series ends Sunday with Braves LHP Mike Minor (5-2) facing Dodgers RHP Matt Magill (0-0).	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

MIAMI --  It took nine starts, but Brandon McCarthy finally got his first win with the Arizona Diamondbacks.	McCarthy pitched a three-hitter for his first win since being struck in the head by a line drive last season, helping the Diamondbacks beat the Miami Marlins 1-0 on Saturday night.	"He just got on a roll and we left him in there," Arizona manager Kirk Gibson said. "He did it quickly, that was the best sign of all."	Gerardo Parra led off the game with a home run for Arizona, which has won four in a row while dealing the Marlins a season-long seven-game losing streak.	"It was a good baseball game," Marlins manager Mike Redmond said. "The outcome wasn't good for us but it was a good game. I thought guys were aggressive. We got good pitches to hit, but we can't get out of the other end of these tight games."	McCarthy (1-3) struck out five and walked two while throwing 68 of 99 pitches for strikes in his third career shutout, first since Sept. 3, 2011, against Seattle.	"It's something that I want to do and be able to follow through on," said McCarthy of his seventh career complete game.	McCarthy was hit in the head by an Erick Aybar line drive on Sept 5. 2012, against the Angels while with Oakland. He suffered a skull fracture and underwent surgery to end his season.	He signed a two-year deal with Arizona in December and went without a win in his first eight starts with his new club.	"The win part, I don't care, like I said last week, it's a win for us, which is the only thing I care about," McCarthy said. "My numbers and stats are really inconsequential. It's nice that we were able to get it and it was nice that I was a big part of that, but that's how I look at it."	Last Sunday, McCarthy was pulled after eight scoreless innings and 88 pitches, and Arizona's relievers blew a late lead during a 4-2 loss in 10 innings to the Philadelphia Phillies.	Parra's home run to right-center field came on the first pitch from Tom Koehler (0-2) on Saturday. It was Parra's third career leadoff home run and it came on the advice of batting coach Don Baylor.	"I talked to him before the game and he said, 'Just swing first pitch' and he was right," Parra said. "He's got more experience than me.	It was the first time since Sept. 14, 1993, in which a game featured a leadoff home run on the first pitch of the game and that was the only run scored, according to the Elias Sports Bureau when Carlos Garcia accomplished the feat for the Pirates against the Marlins.	"You're just trying to throw a first-pitch strike, but I don't think you could have put it on a tee any better," Koehler said. "He swings first pitch and he got exactly what he was looking for. And he took care of it."	Miami had a chance to tie the game in the bottom of the first on Chris Coghlan's single to right, but Parra threw out Derek Dietrich at the plate to end the inning.	"The throw there, we've seen it a lot," Gibson said. "It's unreal how good he is and how accurate and strong his arm is. It was a big play for us."	McCarthy retired the next 14 batters he faced until Adeiny Hechavarria singled in the sixth. Hechavarria advanced to second on a passed ball, but McCarthy struck out Dietrich to end the inning.	"From about the second inning on I was kind of able to get back to (a focus point) and at least repeat my delivery, make some pitches, and turn the game over to my favor instead of the first where everything was a little too optimal and too hittable," McCarthy said.	The Marlins had another scoring opportunity in the seventh after a balk by McCarthy advanced Marcell Ozuna to second, but Placido Polanco lined out to end the threat.	McCarthy retired the final nine batters to complete a 2-hour, 24-minute gem.	Koehler, making his third career start, limited the Diamondbacks to one run and three hits over six innings. He struck out seven and walked two.	Ryan Webb pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings in relief to extend his scoreless streak to 16 2/3 innings for Miami.	Game notes	 McCarthy has walked three batters or fewer in 68 straight starts, the third-longest active streak in baseball. ... Diamondbacks 1B Paul Goldschmidt went 1 for 4 and is hitting .426 (23 for 54) with seven home runs and 17 RBIs in May. ... Marlins 1B Logan Morrison (knee) will begin a rehab assignment on Monday with Class A Jupiter. ...

ST. LOUIS --  Jeff Bianchi got a rare start and made the move pay off for the Milwaukee Brewers.	Bianchi drove in two runs with a 10th-inning single up the middle as the Brewers beat the St. Louis Cardinals 6-4 on Saturday night.	Bianchi made his second start since coming off the disabled list on May 2 after he was sidelined by bursitis in his left hip.	"It feels great," he said. "Biggest thing was we got a win."	The Brewers snapped a four-game losing streak and improved to 3-13 in May. It also gave John Axford (1-3) his first win since Sept. 1, 2012.	Jim Henderson worked a perfect inning for his eighth save in eight chances.	Getting the start over the struggling Rickie Weeks, Bianchi singled just past diving shortstop Pete Kozma to give him his first two RBIs of the season. He had only five at-bats before Saturday and one hit in seven games.	The Brewers loaded the bases with one out in the 10th against Joe Kelly (0-2). Logan Schafer grounded into a fielder's choice to a pulled-in Kozma, who threw home to force out Ryan Braun and set up Bianchi's game-winner.	"You get a guy at third base with no out, all of a sudden the next two guys make outs and you're like, `OK," Milwaukee manager Ron Roenicke said. "And we get a big hit."	Kelly allowed runs for the first time in five appearances. He allowed two hits and a walk in one inning for the Cardinals, who fell to 0-3 in extra-inning games.	"I just gave up some hits and then I got the ground balls I needed to. I thought I was going to get out of it, and made another good pitch," Kelly said. "It found a way to stick up the middle."	Axford gave up one hit and two walks in 1 1/3 innings to earn the win. Axford struck out two, including pinch-hitter Daniel Descalso with the bases loaded to end a ninth-inning threat.	He also threw as hard as he had in some time, clocking one pitch at 97 mph.	"I've been feeling good lately," he said. "I looked in the mirror and got a little deeper inside myself the last few outings. I think I dug in and realized I need to do a little bit more."	Jean Segura, Ryan Braun, Aramis Ramirez all had three hits for the Brewers. Segura and Braun both had two RBIs.	The Cardinals used four consecutive singles with two outs in the sixth inning to tie it 4-4. Matt Carpenter's hit chased Milwaukee starter Marco Estrada and drove in Kozma who started the rally. Jon Jay's single brought in Ty Wigginton.	Braun gave Milwaukee a 4-2 lead in the fifth with his second single of the game.	The Brewers broke through in the third with a two-out rally. Segura's fourth triple of the season drove in Bianchi and Norichika Aoki to make it 2-2. Braun gave Milwaukee a 3-2 lead with his first single.	St. Louis scored twice in the second but left the bases loaded. Kozma drove in Allen Craig, who walked to start the inning. Carpenter's single gave the Cardinals a 2-0 lead.	Estrada gave up four runs, seven hits and four walks over 5 2/3 innings. He struck out two.	Lance Lynn lasted just five innings. He gave up four earned runs on eight hits and two walks as his ERA rose to 3.27 from 2.88.	He struck out three, his fewest since his first start of the season when he was lifted after four innings at Arizona on April 3.	"I would have liked to pitch better today to help us win the game," Lynn said. "But everybody else picked up the slack."	Game notes	 Kozma has a five-game hitting streak (7-of-19, .368). . Jay has 14 RBI in the past 14 games. . Aoki has multiple hits in five of six games (13-of-26, .500). . Brewers LHP Chris Naverson threw curveballs on Friday for the first time since going on the disabled list April 7 because of a strained left middle finger. Roenicke said it was the final test before he is cleared to throw in a rehab game. ... Milwaukee LHP Tom Gorzelanny is on pace to return from the disabled list at the end of the month. He is set to throw a bullpen session Sunday and a simulated game Tuesday. He has been sidelined since May 8 because of tendinitis in his left shoulder. ... Former Cardinals OF So Taguchi provided color commentary for Japanese broadcaster NHK from its Tokyo studio.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Elvis Andrus was swinging for the fences in the eighth inning.	The Texas shortstop, though, was thrilled with a soft single that capped one of the best nights of his career.	Andrus had a career-high five hits, Mitch Moreland homered and Texas roughed up Anibal Sanchez in the Rangers' 7-2 victory over the Detroit Tigers on Saturday night.	Andrus scored three runs, had two RBIs and stole a pair of bases as he hit leadoff for the second straight game in place of ailing second baseman Ian Kinsler. Andrus was a home run shy of the cycle and finished off his 5-for-5 game with a single to right in the eighth.	"(Adrian) Beltre told me to take three hard swings," said Andrus, who hasn't homered since last Sept. 4. "Try to go yard. That's what I did, but the pitch was down. But I'm really happy with a base hit."	Moreland hit a solo shot off Sanchez leading off the third, his 10th home run of the season.	The Rangers (28-15) have the best record in baseball and are a game better than the New York Yankees for the best mark in the American League.	Kinsler missed his second straight game with bruised ribs, an injury that was aggravated after he was hit by a pitch from Justin Verlander on Thursday night.	Andrus, who batted leadoff for the Rangers in 2010 when they won the American League crown, will go back to his No. 2 spot in the order when Kinsler returns.	"The only thing I'm concerned about is Elvis leading the team and he's taking advantage of it," Texas manager Ron Washington said. "Ian Kinsler has not been Wally Pipped."	Sanchez (4-4) gave up a season-high six runs in 2 2/3 innings, his shortest start in almost two years. The right-hander yielded nine hits, walked two and struck out two as his ERA jumped from 2.05 to 2.77.	This is the second time in three games a Tigers starter hasn't made it out of the third. Verlander gave up eight runs in 2 2/3 innings in Detroit's 10-4 loss to the Rangers on Thursday night.	"Sanchez had a bad night," Detroit manager Jim Leyland said. "He had a tough time throwing strikes. He's been terrific and he'll get back on track."	Texas starter Justin Grimm (3-3) gave up two runs in 6 2/3 innings to snap a three-game losing streak. The rookie allowed seven hits and struck out two while throwing a career-high 105 pitches.	In his second career start last June, Grimm surrendered six runs and eight hits in one inning against the Tigers.	After allowing two runs in the third, Grimm retired 12 of the final 14 batters he faced and left to a standing ovation. He credited a pep talk from Washington after the third inning for his success Saturday.	"Wash got me in the dugout and told me to trust my stuff," Grimm said. "He kind of tapped me in the face and caught me off guard. Just hearing that he had confidence in me meant a lot."	Detroit has lost seven of 11 games and dropped a game behind the Cleveland Indians in the AL Central.	Torii Hunter snapped an 0-for-15 slide with an RBI double and he scored two batters later on Prince Fielder's single, bringing the Tigers within 4-2 in the third.	Andrus singled on Sanchez's first pitch of the game, then stole second and advanced to third on catcher Alex Avila's throwing error. The Texas shortstop scored on Avila's passed ball.	The Rangers extended their lead to 4-0 with three runs in the second.	Andrus got the inning going with an RBI triple that tipped the end of Hunter's glove in right and he scored on Sanchez's throwing error.	Lance Berkman capped the second inning with an RBI single.	Sanchez threw 32 pitches in each of the first two innings. This was his shortest start since going 1 2/3 innings Aug. 10, 2011 as a member of the Marlins.	"It's a bad outing," Sanchez said. "I don't have an excuse. We have to give credit to the team, they swung well."	Moreland led off the third with a 415-foot blast into the Detroit bullpen in left. It was Moreland's seventh home run in May.	Andrus ended Sanchez's night with an RBI single that stretched Texas' lead to 6-2 with two outs in the third.	Berkman's RBI double scored Andrus, who led off the sixth with a double.	"The whole thing about hitting leadoff is being on base to set the tone for the team and that's what I did," Andrus said.	Game notes	 Texas RHP Colby Lewis (elbow) and C A.J. Pierzynski (strained right oblique muscle) will begin rehab assignments Monday for Double-A Frisco. Lewis was removed from his rehab stint earlier in the week with triceps tendinitis, but he threw on the field Saturday with no problems. . Leyland expects OF Austin Jackson (strained right hamstring) to return from the disabled list when he is eligible May 27.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DENVER -- Tyler Chatwood crossed up catcher Wilin Rosario, throwing a curve instead of a fastball, and it skipped past his catcher and bounced to the backstop.	Buster Posey raced from second to third.	But the ball ricocheted right back to Rosario, who spun and nailed Posey by several feet.	It would be that kind of night for both the Colorado Rockies and the San Francisco Giants.	"That was awesome," Chatwood said after the Rockies' 10-2 rout Saturday night. "That was completely my fault. We had just gone over the signs and I completely whiffed it. So, for that to work out like it did was pretty helpful.	"I crossed him up pretty good. But it worked out."	Just like the rest of the night did for the Rockies, who capitalized on three more errors by the mistake-prone Giants.	The wall was moved up six feet during the offseason when the Rockies added a walkway in front of the first row of box seats behind the plate, and that surely made a difference on the big play that helped thwart a big second inning by San Francisco.	"He crossed me up, but that's OK," Rosario said. "I got lucky the ball hit the wall and come back fast to me."	Chatwood (2-0) weaved his way in and out of several more sticky situations, allowing seven hits and four walks in 5 2/3 innings -- but he gave up just one run before hitting the showers after a 99-pitch performance.	Promoted from Triple-A Colorado Springs before the game for his second stint with the Rockies, Chatwood helped himself out with an RBI single off Tim Lincecum, too.	"I enjoy it, it's fun," Chatwood said of hitting.	Fielding has been a nightmare for the Giants on this trip.	"We just came off a really good homestand and everything's that hit is either not at us or we're having some difficulties handling tough balls. It's a funk," Giants right fielder Hunter Pence said.	In addition to his nifty defensive play to thwart a big second inning, Rosario drove in three runs for the Rockies, who beat the Giants for the second straight time after snapping a 10-game losing streak to them with a 10-9 win one night earlier.	Lincecum (3-3) committed a costly throwing error that led to a three-run third inning and also had a balk when he slipped off the mound that led to another run in the fourth before Rosario took him deep for his ninth homer in the fifth.	The Giants' defensive slump continued despite a team meeting before the game in which manager Bruce Bochy addressed San Francisco's poor play in the field.	Then, he watched the Giants commit three more errors, giving them a dozen in the first five games of their six-game trip that wraps up Sunday at Coors Field.	Posey airmailed a throw into center field on Carlos Gonzalez's stolen base attempt in the first inning. Gonzalez trotted to third but he was stranded there when Lincecum got Troy Tulowitzki to ground out to short to end the inning.	In the top of the second inning, Posey tried to advance to third on a pitch that got past Rosario only to be out by several feet. Brandon Belt followed with a two-out double to the right-field corner.	Gregor Blanco drove in Belt with a bloop single to center, and Brandon Crawford drew an intentional walk before Lincecum was caught looking at the third strike, thwarting what could have been a bigger inning.	The Giants' second error proved more costly as Lincecum's bad throw on a comebacker led to a big third inning for Colorado.	"It was just frustrating," Lincecum said. "Just not consistently hitting spots, leaving balls up. Kicking the ball around. That was probably the biggest frustrating thing for myself when I knew I could have made that play. After that I didn't collect myself and concentrate. Kind of unraveled."	Dexter Fowler doubled down the left-field line, scoring Charlie Blackmon from second to tie it at 1. Fowler scored when Lincecum fielded Josh Rutledge's chopper and threw the ball into right field. Rutledge ended up at third base and trotted home on Gonzalez's groundout.	"Trying to make something there out of what's not possible," Bochy said. "That's what we've got to stop doing, compounding the problem. We've done it a few too many times. It might have caused him to lose a little focus."	Lincecum said the Giants are pressing on defense.	"People try to do too much in tough situations because we want to make that big play. That's who we are," Lincecum said. "When it doesn't get made, it just adds to that frustration."	The last time the Giants committed 12 errors in a five-game span was April 18-22, 1996, according to the team.	"Errors aren't always mental," Lincecum said. "You try to find the silver lining in the effort. It's not for lack of effort. Everyone's hustling, everyone's trying to make that play, that's why it's tough."	Lincecum slipped off the rubber while pitching to Blackmon in the fourth, resulting in a balk that sent Nolan Arenado to second base. He took third when Blackmon flied out to center and scored on Chatwood's single back up the middle, making it 4-1.	"My spike slipped on the mound," Lincecum said. "It's happened twice here already."	The Giants put runners at the corners in the fifth but Posey grounded out to the mound to end the threat, and Rosario's two-run homer, his ninth, made it 6-1 in the fifth.	All of the six runs Lincecum allowed in five innings were earned. He gave up seven hits and walked a pair.	Rosario's 60-foot dribbler down the third-base line off Jean Machi in the seventh drove in Fowler from third to make it 7-1.	Crawford's RBI single made it 7-2 in the eighth, but he committed San Francisco's third error in the bottom half of the inning when he took his eye off a throw back into the infield, allowing Fowler to advance to second following an RBI single.	Game notes	Tulowitzki added a two-run single off George Kontos to make it 10-2 ... Josh Outman threw two effective innings of relief and Wilton Lopez got the final four outs. ... Rockies OF Michael Cuddyer says he doubts his neck will bother him again this season after getting an epidural that relieved pain and stiffness. He returned to throwing and taking batting practice Saturday. ... The Giants and Rockies wrap up their four-game series Sunday with LHP Barry Zito (3-2) and RHP Juan Nicasio (3-1) squaring off.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- Tommy Milone threw more than 50 pitches before recording the first out of the second inning, and Oakland manager Bob Melvin wasn't sure how much longer his starter would last.	Milone not only stuck it out, he ended the longest losing streak of his career despite the Athletics still having trouble scoring when he's on the mound.	The left-hander overcame his rough start to outduel Ervin Santana and win for the first time in more than a month, and the A's scored twice in the sixth inning to beat the Kansas City Royals 2-1 on Saturday night.	"That was Houdini," Melvin said after Oakland's second straight one-run win. "He was at 50 pitches with three outs, 70 pitches with six or seven outs and he still goes six innings. I've been impressed with a lot of his starts but none more than that."	Milone (4-5) wasn't crisp and pitched with runners on base in all but one of his six innings but kept the damage to a minimum.	The Royals loaded the bases with no outs in the second but Milone got out of it without allowing a run. Elliot Johnson fouled out to first baseman Brandon Moss near the Kansas City dugout before Milone struck out Lorenzo Cain and Alcides Escobar.	Milone worked out of trouble again in the third when he gave up a leadoff double to Salvador Perez before retiring the next three batters.	"I always feel like I'm going to make it out of every inning," Milone said. "I definitely didn't make it easy on myself. Being able to come back and get out of those situations, it feels good at the end of the day."	Milone walked three and had four strikeouts but overcame his uneven performance to win for the first time since April 15. Ryan Cook and Sean Doolittle each pitched a scoreless inning of relief, and Grant Balfour worked the ninth for his eighth save.	That was enough to offset a solid start by Santana.	Santana (3-3) pitched much more effectively than Milone but was denied in his third attempt at earning his 100th career victory. He allowed only three baserunners through the first five innings and gave up just four hits total but got little support.	"He really threw the ball good (but) right now there is no room for error for any of (our pitchers) out there," Kansas City manager Ned Yost said. "We had great opportunities. We just didn't capitalize."	The A's have scored just eight runs over Milone's last six starts and were getting shut out before scoring twice in the sixth.	Moss hit a tiebreaking triple in the sixth off Santana, one of just five hits Oakland managed. Moss was mired in a 4-for-30 slump before tripling over the head of center fielder Cain to drive in Coco Crisp, who had walked.	Eric Sogard started the inning with a leadoff double and scored on Jed Lowrie's sacrifice fly.	The A's were also held to two runs for the third consecutive game but made it hold up in front of a rare sellout crowd at the Oakland Coliseum. The A's also beat Kansas City 2-1 on Friday.	Billy Butler singled twice and drove in the only run for Kansas City, which has lost nine of 12.	Oakland didn't get much else but didn't need it.	The Royals failed to score after loading the bases against Milone with no outs in the second. They also stranded a runner at third with one out in the fourth.	"That's Tommy for you," said Sogard, who went 2 for 3. "He battled and kept us in the game. The kid's a fighter."	Kansas City had the tying run on base in the ninth after Eric Hosmer drew a leadoff walk but Balfour retired the next three batters on flyouts.	Alex Gordon doubled with two outs in the first and scored on Butler's bloop single to give Kansas City a 1-0 lead.	Game notes	Oakland OF Chris Young went 0 for 2 with a walk in his first game back from the disabled list. Young was activated before the game. ... A's 3B Josh Donaldson doubled in the second to extend his hitting streak to a career-best seven games. ... To clear room for Young, Oakland 1B Daric Barton was designated for assignment. Barton hit .143 with one home run and three RBIs in eight games with the A's. It's the second time this season Barton has been designated for assignment. ... RHP A.J. Griffin (4-3) starts the series finale for Oakland in his first career appearance against the Royals. ... RHP Luis Mendoza (1-2), who pitches for Kansas City on Sunday, has a 3.48 ERA in five appearances against the A's.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CLEVELAND --  Cy Young himself wouldn't want to mess with the Indians right now.	Justin Masterson struck out a season-high 11 in seven shutout innings and Michael Brantley hit a three-run homer and drove in four runs off Felix Hernandez as Cleveland toppled yet another former Cy Young Award winner on Sunday with a 6-0 victory over the Seattle Mariners.	Brantley connected in the second inning off Hernandez (5-3), who failed to go at least six innings for the first time this season.	The Indians, who improved to 17-4 since April 28, are 7-1 this season against Cy Young recipients. They've knocked off Hernandez, R.A. Dickey, David Price, Roy Halladay, Cliff Lee, Bartolo Colon and Justin Verlander. The Indians are taking pride in knocking off trophy-winning pitchers.	"We just take it as a challenge," Indians first baseman Nick Swisher said. "We've got that scrappy-type and gritty-type of team. It may not always be pretty, man, but somehow we're going to find a way to get it done. We just love coming to the ballpark right now.	"Things are rocking," Swisher said.	Before the game, Brantley said the Indians talked about taking down another trophy-winning pitcher.	"We're loose and we're not holding nothing back," Brantley said. "Everybody has smiles on their faces. We just want to make sure we enjoy this. We're playing great baseball right now and we just want to keep it up."	Staked to an early lead, Masterson (7-2) was dominant for the second straight start. He allowed three singles, easily outdueled Hernandez and ran his consecutive scoreless innings streak to 19. He shut out the New York Yankees 1-0 on four hits in his previous outing.	"From the very first pitch of the game he came out firing," Indians manager Terry Francona said. "He was not only firing, but he was pitching. He was using both sides of the plate. He was using a two-seamer, four-seamer, throwing breaking balls to both sides of the plate. He kept going up, down, in, out. He worked ahead."	The AL Central-leading Indians are a baseball-best 20-7 since April 20.	"We've got a good thing going in here," Swisher said. "We've got a lot of confident, excited guys and we're going out and proving that."	Following walkoff wins in the first two games of the series, Cleveland took the drama out of this one early, building a 5-0 lead after two innings against Hernandez.	The 2010 Cy Young winner, who left his previous start after six innings with back stiffness, came in with the league's lowest ERA (1.53) but it rose to 2.07 after he gave up six runs and eight hits in five innings. Hernandez struck out eight, including the final three batters, but he was wasn't on his game -- and neither were the Mariners.	Seattle was only charged with one error, but the Mariners made several mental mistakes that helped the Indians.	"You're going to have games like that when a couple of things happen and you make a couple of mistakes," Mariners manager Eric Wedge said. "That's what happened to us. It was one of those days for Felix and one of those days for us."	It's not like Masterson needed much help.	The big right-hander overpowered the Mariners, who couldn't catch up to his 97 mph fastball and only had two runners reach second base against him. The Indians were hoping Masterson could develop into their ace, and so far this season he's been the dependable front-of-the-rotation starter they desperately needed.	"His stuff is dominant," Francona said. "He's been consistent, but consistent at a level with his velocity, breaking ball, ability to hold runners. He's just done everything."	Pitching with a six-run lead, he got stronger as the game progressed. He struck out five of the last six batters he faced and fanned seven in the last three innings.	Last season was a struggle for Masterson, who went 11-15 with a 4.93 ERA.	So what's he doing better?	"Everything," he said, laughing.	Brantley's three-run homer with two outs in the second gave the Indians a 5-0 lead over Hernandez.	The right-hander, who needed 35 pitches to get through the first, retired the first two hitters on groundouts before Michael Bourn singled and went to third on Jason Kipnis' base hit to center. Brantley then drove an 0-1 pitch into the Indians' bullpen in center for just his second homer.	It was a stunning development against Hernandez, who came in having allowed just four earned runs in 44 innings over his past six starts.	In the eight starts against the Indians, the former Cy Young winners have a collective 8.21 ERA.	A fundamental gaffe by Hernandez allowed the Indians to add a run in the fourth. With Mike Aviles at second after a double, Drew Stubbs topped a ball into the dirt that catcher Jesus Montero fielded in front of the plate and threw to first for the out. Aviles never slowed coming around third and scored easily because Montero got caught up the line and Hernandez failed to cover home.	"That's just beautiful right there," Masterson said. "Those are the type of things you want to see, and that's what defines this team and makes it so special."	Game notes	 Cleveland's starters are 13-4 in the past 21 games. ... The Indians are 6-0-4 in their last 10 series. ... White Sox RHP Jake Peavy is the only former Cy Young winner to beat the Indians this season. ... Masterson is the fifth starter to record double-digit strikeouts against the Mariners in 2013. ... The Indians will try to complete the four-game sweep on Monday as the teams conclude their wrap-around series with a matinee. ... The Indians are 9-1 against the AL West. ... Cleveland has seven shutouts, its most through 42 games since 2008.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MIAMI --  Ricky Nolasco followed his worst outing of the season with his best.	It resulted in a rare win for the Miami Marlins.	Nolasco struck out 11 and the Marlins stopped a season-high seven-game losing streak, holding off the Arizona Diamondbacks 2-1 Sunday.	"We've been playing close games, but it doesn't matter if you lose 10-0 or 2-1, you don't want to lose so it was good to snap that and try to get on a roll here," Nolasco said.	The Diamondbacks scored once in the ninth. Mike Dunn, the Marlins' third pitcher of the inning, got pinch-hitter A.J. Pollock to ground out on a 3-2 pitch with the bases loaded to end it.	"Bend, but don't break, that's all that matters," Nolasco said.	Marcell Ozuna broke a scoreless tie with a two-run double in the sixth.	Didi Gregorius had three hits for Arizona, which had won four in a row.	"Early in the game we had a few chances, but we couldn't get the big hit when we needed it and (Nolasco) got stronger," Gregorius said.	Nolasco (3-5) was coming off an outing in which he allowed six runs in five innings in a loss to Cincinnati on Tuesday.	"Ricky was great," Marlins manager Mike Redmond said. "Coming off a shaky last start, but that's Ricky. Ricky's been solid all year and I really wanted him to finish that game. He looked good and was in complete control."	But the Marlins' all-time wins leader bounced back with his best, earning his 79th career victory. He gave up one run and five hits in eight-plus innings.	"I felt good, good command of all my pitches," Nolasco said. "The curve ball was really good so that really helped a lot. I was able to spin it pretty much whenever I wanted to."	After hitting Cody Ross with a pitch in the fourth, Nolasco retired the next 14 batters, striking out the side in the fifth and again in the eighth.	Gregorius led off the ninth with a double, finishing Nolasco's day after 110 pitches, 74 for strikes.	Closer Steve Cishek relieved got Paul Goldschmidt to ground out as second baseman Derek Dietrich made a backhanded play up the middle. Jason Kubel hit a sacrifice fly that made it 2-1.	"That was a huge play in the hole," Redmond said.	After Eric Chavez followed with a pinch-hit single and Martin Prado walked, Dunn came in and walked Miguel Montero to load the bases. Dunn retired Pollock for his second career save.	"We had a good finish and I thought we were in good shape with A.J. (Pollock) there," Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson said. "It just didn't work out."	Wade Miley (3-3) gave up two runs and five hits in six innings while striking out six. He is 2-1 with a 0.89 ERA in three career starts against the Marlins.	"I felt good out there," Miley said. "I was making pitches and throwing strikes. Just a couple of bad pitches cost you late in the game, especially in a game like that where it's 0-0. You've got to do better job."	With the game scoreless until the sixth, Adeiny Hechavarria and Dietrich singled and Ozuna hit a double off the left-center field wall near the 386-foot sign. It snapped a scoreless inning streak for the Marlins at 14 after Brandon McCarthy tossed a three-hit shutout on Saturday in a 1-0 win.	"I thought it was a home run, but it's OK, a double, I'll take it," Ozuna said.	Ozuna, a 22-year-old rookie outfielder, is hitting .295 since being called up on April 30.	After getting nine runs on 16 hits in a series-opening 9-2 win on Friday, Arizona scored just two runs on 10 hits in the final two games.	"We got beat around a little bit, but we were able to pitch some really nice games the last couple of days," Redmond said.	Game notes	 Arizona pulled off a rare 2-1 putout in eighth when Hechavarria popped up a bunt that bounced off catcher Montero's glove and then corralled by pitcher Josh Collmenter after he bobbled it with his barehand. ... Nolasco's career high for strikeouts in a game is 16 at Atlanta on Sept. 30, 2009. ... Arizona continues its road trip at Colorado on Monday as LHP Patrick Corbin (6-1, 1.52 ERA) faces RHP Jon Garland (3-4, 4.89 ERA). Miami will start RHP Alex Sanabia (2-6, 5.00 ERA) at home against Philadelphia LHP Cole Hamels (1-6, 4.61 ERA).	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

BALTIMORE -- Matt Moore isn't only breaking records set by Cy Young winner David Price, he's performing at a level that's drawing comparisons to a pretty good southpaw named Babe Ruth.	Moore pitched seven innings of five-hit ball to stay unbeaten, Luke Scott and Matt Joyce homered and the Tampa Bay Rays beat the Baltimore Orioles 3-1 Sunday for a three-game sweep.	Moore (8-0) gave up one run, struck out three and walked one to become the first eight-game winner in the majors. The left-hander has won nine straight decisions, breaking the franchise record of eight set last year by Price.	Not only that, but the 23-year-old is the youngest lefty to start the season 8-0 since Ruth did it in 1917 at age 22.	"Historically speaking, it's been wonderful," Rays manager Joe Maddon said of Moore's season.	Moore is delighted with the results, especially because Tampa Bay is 9-0 in his nine starts.	"It's good for our team. That's the biggest thing we can take away from my record," he said. "On my days to pitch, we're winning all the games. That's the most important part. "	The Rays' ninth victory in 11 games left them a season-high three games over .500 (23-20) and lifted Tampa Bay into a third-place tie with skidding Baltimore in the AL East. The Rays had been in fourth since April 20.	"It puts us back in with a tie, standings-wise, which I think is important," Maddon said. "You got to get over each team that is in front of you before you can get back to the top. To come in here (and get a sweep) indicates how much better we've been playing."	Adam Jones had two hits, stole two bases and drove in a run for the Orioles, who have dropped five straight -- all at home. Baltimore managed only five hits, none after the sixth inning.	"He's dealing right now," Jones said of Moore.	Baltimore was outscored 22-16 in the first two games of the series. This time, poor pitching could not be blamed for the defeat.	"Pitching wasn't the issue today," manager Buck Showalter said. "It was trying to solve Moore. He was the difference-maker."	Chris Tillman (3-2) allowed three runs and five hits in six innings. He's 1-5 lifetime against the Rays.	Tampa Bay led 2-1 in the sixth inning when Joyce hit a drive that appeared to bounce off the wall near the right-field foul pole. First base umpire Dan Iassogna called it a fair ball but not a home run.	Showalter argued that it was a foul ball and Maddon contended it was a home run.	"It's kind of unusual for us both to be out there at the same time," Maddon said. "I had to argue the point that it could be a home run."	After a lengthy meeting, the umpires adjourned to watch a replay and returned with their decision: home run.	"I've got a guy who lets me know if I have a good argument, so I knew once they went inside it was going to be a home run," Showalter said.	Moore and the Tampa Bay bullpen made the 3-1 lead stand up. Joel Peralta worked a perfect eighth and Fernando Rodney got three straight outs for his eighth save.	Neither team had a base runner until Yunel Escobar drew a two-out walk in the third. Desmond Jennings followed with an RBI double on a 3-2 pitch.	In the bottom half, Danny Valencia hit a leadoff double in his first at-bat with Baltimore but was stranded.	One inning later, Manny Machado was credited with a triple after Jennings and Joyce nearly collided on a line drive to right that ticked off Joyce's glove and rolled to the wall. Jones followed with a run-scoring single, then stole two bases but was left at third.	Scott, who played for Baltimore from 2008-11, connected in the fifth for a 2-1 lead. He has at least one RBI in nine of 13 starts this season.	Game notes	Tampa Bay's Evan Longoria extended his hitting streak to a career-high 13 games. ... Tampa Bay has held the lead in 30 of its past 31 games. ... The Rays recalled LHP Jeff Beliveau from Triple-A Durham and optioned LHP Alex Torres to the same club. Beliveau was sent back to Durham to make room for RHP Jake Odorizzi, who will be recalled Monday to start an afternoon game in Toronto. It will be his debut with the Rays. ... The Orioles recalled Valencia from Triple-A Norfolk after sending 2B Ryan Flaherty to Norfolk after Saturday's game. ... Baltimore opens a three-game series Monday night against the AL East-leading New York Yankees. Freddy Garcia will start for the Orioles. ... Jones has been successful on all seven stolen base attempts this season.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

ATLANTA -- Ramiro Pena got a fierce wakeup call with the bases loaded and the scored tied in the eighth inning.	Pena fouled the first pitch off his lower right leg and bent over in anguish. But after he fouled off the next pitch, he hit a sacrifice fly to put the Atlanta Braves ahead to stay.	"I needed to keep the focus," Pena said. "That's a big at-bat right there, so I just tried to make contact and put the ball in play."	Pena had a tiebreaking sacrifice fly in a four-run eighth, Jordan Schafer drove in two runs and the Braves rallied against the Los Angeles Dodgers' beleaguered bullpen for a 5-2 victory on a rain-soaked Sunday.	Kenley Jansen (1-3) was the loser for the second straight game, this time allowing one hit, two runs and a walk while getting just one out in a game twice delayed by rain for a total of 2 hours, 15 minutes.	"With a rain delay and getting tired a little bit later, you have to keep concentrating on the game," Pena said. "Everybody did a great job from the beginning (of the eighth), and I think everybody put something in that inning."	Jansen began the eighth by allowing a single to Freddie Freeman and walking Brian McCann. Dodgers manager Don Mattingly brought in closer Brandon League for the first time in the series, but he fared no better than his teammate.	After Atlanta loaded the bases when third baseman Juan Uribe was charged with a fielding error on Andrelton Simmons' sacrifice bunt attempt, League gave up a tying RBI single to pinch-hitter Gerald Laird to make it 2-all. Pinch-runner B.J. Upton scored on Pena's sacrifice fly.	The Braves added two more runs off League on Chris Johnson's RBI single and a sacrifice bunt by Schafer.	Closer Craig Kimbrel earned his third save of the series and 14th in 17 chances as the Braves earned their fourth series sweep this season.	Kimbrel struck out Matt Kemp and Adrian Gonzalez before A.J. Ellis walked. Atlanta had retired 19 straight batters before Ellis' walk, but Kimbrel ended it with a strikeout of Andre Ethier.	"We were on the road a lot and lost a lot of games we felt we should have won," Braves starting pitcher Mike Minor said. "Today we came back in another one from behind and got the sweep."	After watching his hitters struggle from the fourth inning on, Mattingly refused to put all the blame on Los Angeles' bullpen.	"You add on a run here or there, it takes a lot of pressure off a guy that you can't give up one hit that changes the whole game," Mattingly said. "I think we have to take this all as a group."	Luis Avilan (2-0) pitched a perfect eighth inning, striking out one.	The Dodgers went up 1-0 in the first when Carl Crawford led off with a double, moved to third on Mark Ellis' groundout and scored on Gonzalez's RBI single.	In the third, Crawford walked, moved to third on Kemp's double and crossed the plate on Gonzalez's sacrifice fly to give Los Angeles a 2-0 lead.	Los Angeles rookie Matt Magill didn't allow a runner to reach scoring position until the fifth when Pena reached on fielder's choice, advanced to second on Minor's single and scored on Schafer's RBI single to make it 2-1.	Magill was chased on Justin Upton's leadoff single in the sixth. J.P. Howell made just two pitches, a pair of strikes to Freeman, when the game was stopped by a second rain delay. This one lasted 33 minutes.	Magill, who could lose his spot in the rotation with Ted Lilly likely to come off the disabled list on Monday, gave up four hits, one unearned run and three walks in five-plus innings. Magill has a 5.00 ERA in four starts.	Minor allowed three hits and two runs with two walks and a season-high nine strikeouts in six innings.	In Atlanta's seventh, Mattingly used three pitchers -- Ronald Belisario, Paco Rodriguez and Jansen -- to face five batters. Jansen, who took the loss Saturday by giving up homers to Gattis and Simmons, struck out Justin Upton to end a threat with runners on first and second.	The Braves, whose 55 homers rank second in the National League, won without hitting a ball over the fence. They beat the Dodgers Friday on Justin Upton's grand slam off Rodriguez and Saturday with Gattis and Simmons going deep.	"We've been slow out of the gate as an offense (over the last three games), and (the pitching staff has) been able to keep us in the ballgame and keep runs off the board," Justin Upton said. "That's important in giving us a shot to win."	Game notes	The Braves earned their first three-game sweep of the Dodgers since April 18-20, 2008. ... Before Kemp doubled in the third, he had just three hits in 42 career at-bats at Turner Field. ... Mattingly said X-rays on RF Scott Van Slyke's left lower leg were negative. Van Slyke hit balls off nearly the same spot on his leg on two consecutive pitches, but finished the at-bat. ... Mark Ellis, out since April 27 with a strained right quadriceps, returned to the lineup and went 0 for 4 with one strikeout. C Tim Federowicz was optioned to Triple-A Albuquerque to make room on the roster.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

PHILADELPHIA -- Freddy Galvis has a memory to cherish forever, and Cliff Lee feels a lot better because Galvis does.	Galvis and Erik Kratz each homered off closer Aroldis Chapman in the bottom of the ninth inning Sunday after Lee's baserunning mistake, rallying the Philadelphia Phillies past the Cincinnati Reds for a stunning 3-2 victory.	"As soon as I hit it, it felt good," Galvis, who never had hit a walkoff homer at any level, said. "Awesome. I think I'll never forget it."	Chapman (3-2) blew his second straight save opportunity after converting his first eight chances this season. The 100 mph-throwing left-hander walked pinch-hitter Delmon Young on four pitches to open the ninth.	Lee, the Phillies' left-hander, pinch ran and was caught trying to steal second base, but Chapman wouldn't record another out. Kratz, who entered the game in the third inning after Carlos Ruiz left with a strained right hamstring, pulled a 3-2 pitch over the seats in left to tie it at 2-all.	Galvis followed by lining a 1-1 pitch just inside the foul pole in left.	Lee breathed a sigh of relief after his inexplicable gaffe.	"That's basically the last thing you need to do right there," he said. "It was brutal. I felt horrible. (Winning) was a really good feeling."	Antonio Bastardo (2-1) pitched a scoreless ninth inning for Philadelphia.	"Today's game was definitely a pick me up," said manager Charlie Manuel, whose Phillies open a three-game set at Miami on Monday. "It will give us a nice little ride to Florida."	Slugging first baseman Ryan Howard will not be making the trip to Miami with the team. He's going to have an MRI Monday on his sore left knee.	Howard, who is batting .245 with 46 strikeouts in 151 at-bats this season, has four hits in his last 34 at-bats.	Manuel didn't sound optimistic about Howard's chances to play on Monday.	"We'll see," Howard said. "It's been acting up. I've been able to tough it out but told (Manuel) it was sore."	Ruiz left the game after straining his right hamstring running the bases in the second inning. He didn't make the trip to Miami with the Phillies and will have an MRI on Monday. Ruiz, who said he heard a "pop" while running, hopes to rejoin the team on Tuesday.	Jay Bruce homered and Homer Bailey tossed seven scoreless innings for the Reds, who appeared headed for their ninth win in 10 games.	"I would've lost a lot of money if I'd bet on that one," Bailey said. "But that's the game."	Bruce led off the second with a towering shot to straightaway center to extend his hitting streak to 10 games. He is batting .390 (16 for 41) with four homers and 12 RBIs during the spurt.	Joey Votto also stayed hot by going 2 for 4 for the Reds. Votto extended his hitting streak to eight games, and he is batting .515 (17 for 33) over the stretch.	Bailey shut down the Phillies for the second time this season and left without a victory for the second time. He allowed five hits with three strikeouts and a walk. He also got a no-decision on April 16 in a 1-0 loss to the Phillies when he pitched eight scoreless innings while allowing two hits with a career high-tying 10 strikeouts and no walks.	"An unfortunate ending, stunning, but that's the game," Reds manager Dusty Baker said. "It kind of spoils you because you always expect (Chapman) to come through. We've got to get him out of the funk he's in and hope it doesn't last too long."	Chapman got off to a rough start Sunday against Young and seemed upset with home plate umpire Tim Welke while facing the Philadelphia pinch hitter, as Welke called at least two close pitches balls.	"I thought I threw good pitches to the first batter," Chapman said through an interpreter.	And the lefty wasn't upset with the location of Galvis' homer, nor did he expect the loss to linger.	"A fastball where I wanted it," he said. "I don't see any problems. Everybody gets hit. Why not me?"	The Phillies looked as if they were on their way to a seventh shutout of the season before the eighth.	Chase Utley's RBI single in the eighth inning snapped the Phillies' 16 scoreless innings skid.	Ben Revere, returning to the starting lineup after sitting out the last four, had three hits for the Phillies. Revere raised his average from .237 to .256.	Jonathan Pettibone gave up two runs -- one earned -- on seven hits in seven innings and has yet to allow more than three earned runs in six career starts.	The Reds tacked on a run in the sixth on Todd Frazier's RBI double. The run was unearned, though, as Votto advanced to second on Domonic Brown's throwing error after leading off with a single.	Philadelphia got to 2-1 in the eighth on Utley's single that scored Revere, but Brown flew out to right with runners on first and second against reliever Sean Marshall to end the threat.	Regular Phillies third baseman Michael Young started at first base for the first time this season. Young went 0 for 3 with a walk.	Game notes	The Phillies have been shut out six times this season, which is the same total they were blanked in all of 2012. ... The Phillies said right-hander Tyler Cloyd will be called up from Triple-A Lehigh Valley to pitch Tuesday's game at Miami. The team needs a fifth starter with Roy Halladay sidelined after shoulder surgery and John Lannan (knee) on the DL. ... Cincinnati right-hander Johnny Cueto (1-0, 2.60), on the DL since April 15 (strained right lat), is scheduled to face Mets righty Shaun Marcum (0-4, 6.75) when the teams open a three-game series in New York at 7:10 p.m. Monday. ... Phillies lefty Cole Hamels (1-6, 4.61) is slated to oppose Marlins righty Alex Sanabia (2-6, 5.00) at 7:10 p.m. Monday in Miami.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PITTSBURGH --  Jeff Locke didn't have his best stuff Sunday. He didn't need it to shut down the majors' worst team.	Locke allowed three hits over seven innings, Pedro Alvarez homered and the Pittsburgh Pirates won for the eighth time in 10 games, 1-0 over the Houston.	Locke (4-1) won his fourth straight decision and gave up one run or fewer for the fifth time in his past eight outings. He struck out four and walked three.	"Pitched' is the imperative word," Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said of Locke. "He was behind a number of counts, his first-pitch strikes were below 50 percent... but, that being said, he didn't give up anything. He was able to put a foot down, get balls on the ground when we needed them."	In his past six outings, Locke has allowed 21 hits and seven earned runs over 37 innings (1.70 ERA). Despite allowing the leadoff man to reach four times, Locke permitted a runner to reach second base only once.	"There were some pitches early on that were real good pitches that I felt I had real good command of, but there were times in the game that I fell behind 1-0, 2-0 and put them in some pretty good hitter's counts," Locke said. "But I was able to make pitches and use the defense."	The notoriously streaky Alvarez pushed his average above .200 for just the second time since the second game of the season. His eighth home run came on the first pitch and was an opposite field line drive down the left field line in the fifth.	Alvarez's most recent homer was Friday -- a titanic shot that reached the Allegheny River. Hurdle quipped that his third baseman followed up arguably his longest career home run with perhaps his shortest.	"I just remember hitting it and knowing that it was going to be fair," said Alvarez, who also walked in the second and flied out to the wall in center in the seventh. "But I didn't know if it was going to carry as much as it did."	Alvarez's longball -- his third in eight games -- was the lone mistake by Astros starter Lucas Harrell, who lost his third consecutive decision despite allowing four hits and one walk in seven innings.	Through 6 1/3 innings, Alvarez's home run and Snider's double were the only balls to leave the infield off Harrell (3-5), who had a single in a rare plate appearance for an American League pitcher.	"Today felt like the first game this season that I dominated both sides of the plate with my sinker," Harrell said. "(Catcher Carlos Corporan) did a great job with his homework. He had a really good game plan and I just followed along."	Pittsburgh's other chance at scoring came the prior inning, when Travis Snider was thrown out at the plate by center fielder Brandon Barnes on a two-out single by Gaby Sanchez. The throw easily beat	Snider, who had doubled, and Snider's shoulder to the chest of Corporan did not jar the ball loose.	Off to their best 44-game start since 1991, the Pirates (26-18) have the National League's third-best record. They won despite the absence of outfielder Andrew McCutchen, who was a late scratch because of soreness in his right knee.	McCutchen said he was put at ease after an examination by medical personnel Sunday and that he expects to play in the Pirates' next game Tuesday. Hurdle said he could have used McCutchen in an emergency.	A day after his 13-game scoreless streak came to an end, Mark Melancon worked a perfect eighth and Jason Grilli finished with a 1-2-3 ninth for his majors-leading 17th save.	The Astros, who won in 11 innings Saturday night, did not have an extra-base hit.	"Their guy (Locke) did a good job," Houston manager Bo Porter said. "He changed speeds, pitched to both sides of the plate and kept us away from the barrel. Sometimes you've got to tip your cap and give credit to the other guy."	Game notes	 Astros SS Ronny Cedeno was scratched from the lineup late Sunday morning because of a sinus infection. ...  Houston has won three of its 11 series played this season while Pittsburgh is 8-2-2 in its past 12 series. ... The Pirates are off Monday but then play on 16 consecutive days. They open up a three-game series against the Chicago Cubs at PNC Park on Tuesday. ... Astros LHP Dallas Keuchel will make his third start of the season  in the opener of a three-game series in Kansas City on Monday.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

MINNEAPOLIS -- At least John Lackey and the Boston Red Sox had something to keep themselves entertained during a long rain delay on Sunday.	Lackey allowed one hit over six innings before a three-hour delay, Dustin Pedroia and Will Middlebrooks homered and the Red Sox beat the Minnesota Twins 5-1 for their fifth straight victory.	Fans at Target Field saw more than the Twins' fifth straight loss.	The longest delay ever at the ballpark lasted long enough for the 1993 movie "The Sandlot" to be shown in its entirety on the videoboard. Several cast and crew members were at the stadium to celebrate the film's 20th anniversary.	When asked what he did during the delay, Lackey laughed and said he did what everyone else left at the stadium did while it poured.	"Watched 'The Sandlot.' I hadn't seen that in a while," he said before getting back to talking about his performance. "I wanted to go at least another inning. I was definitely frustrated a little bit not to keep going. But winning the game is all that really matters."	The game resumed about 80 minutes after the movie ended and many fans moved into the first eight rows behind the dugouts.	Lackey (2-4) gave up one unearned run and struck out five before dark skies and heavy rain sent fans running for cover as he was warming up to start the seventh.	Lackey ended his three-game losing streak. He didn't allow a runner until Trevor Plouffe led off the fifth with a double. Plouffe later scored on shortstop Pedro Ciriaco's throwing error.	"Crisp. He was powerful," Red Sox manager John Farrell said. "Overall just a solid performance for him."	Earlier this month, Lackey's throwing error against the Twins resulted in four unearned runs and a frustrating loss in the midst of a stretch where the Red Sox went 2-9.	After Andrew Miller pitched a 1-2-3 seventh, Koji Uehara loaded the bases in the eighth, but struck out Joe Mauer to end the threat.	"We didn't really come up with key hits when we needed to or when we wanted to," Twins outfielder Chris Parmelee said. "It's tough to win a ballgame when you don't have any clutch hits."	Junichi Tazawa pitched the ninth and capped a weekend where the Red Sox bullpen didn't allow a run.	Mauer's 15-game hitting streak was snapped. The All-Star catcher struck out three times and has now fanned in 16 straight games.	"It's baseball, man," Plouffe said. "These games, they happen throughout the season and it's something you've got to deal with."	Pedroia drove in three runs, scored twice and extended his hitting streak to 11 games. His two-run homer in the ninth bounced off the wrist of a leaping Josh Willingham and over the left-field wall.	"Lucky," Pedroia said. "But we'll take the break. They're usually robbing 'em."	Middlebrooks' two-out homer in the second off Pedro Hernandez (2-1) traveled 402 feet and flew over the flower pots on top of the scoreboard wall in right-center field.	Movie or no movie, Farrell chuckled when asked about his team's focus coming out of the long delay.	"That's built in," he said. "Even with a three-hour rain delay, they're rarin' to go. Keeping this group focused, I'm not going to say is not an issue, but the game is clearly a priority to them."	Game notes	Red Sox reliever Andrew Bailey threw 17 pitches in one inning of a rehab appearance at Triple-A Pawtucket on Saturday night. Farrell said Bailey -- on the DL since May 6 with a right bicep strain -- is on track to be activated on Monday. ... Franklin Morales, on the DL since March 31 wish a low back strain, started the game for Pawtucket and allowed five runs in four innings. He's expected to make at least one more rehab start. ... Boston SS Stephen Drew missed his second straight game with a sore back. ... Patrick Renna and Chauncey Leopardi, aka "Ham" and "Squints" from "The Sandlot," visited Twins manager Ron Gardenhire in his office before the game. "The players wondered what we did wrong to get summoned to the manager's office," Renna said. ... Jon Lester (6-0, 2.72 ERA) starts on Monday as the Red Sox begin a three-game series in Chicago against the White Sox. Dylan Axelrod (1-3, 4.27) is scheduled to start for Chicago. ... Kevin Correia (4-3, 3.35) starts for Minnesota as the Twins kick off a nine-game road trip against Atlanta on Monday. Julio Teheran (2-1, 4.57) starts for the Braves.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

ST. LOUIS -- Kyle Lohse was the St. Louis Cardinals' ace	last season. Maybe they know too much about him.	David Freese had an RBI in a four-run fourth inning to go with	big plays at third base, and the Cardinals beat their former	teammate for the third straight time with a 4-2 victory over the	Milwaukee Brewers on Sunday.	"Baseball is a stupid game," said Lohse, who was 16-3 for the	Cardinals last season. "Baseball is weird, man. You make some good	pitches and they get some good hits."	Of course, they have a pretty good idea what's coming from	Lohse, who was with St. Louis from 2008-12.	"Yeah, well, he was with the Cardinals, if you remember," said	Pete Kozma, who contributed an RBI squeeze bunt to the rally. "We	kind of know what he has, kind of know his tendencies a little bit,	what his ball does."	John Gast (2-0) won his second straight start in place of the	injured Jake Westbrook and fellow rookie Seth Maness escaped a	bases-loaded, none-out jam in the seventh to help the Cardinals win	for the 14th time in 17 games. They took two of three from	Milwaukee and lead the season series 8-2.	They're down two starting pitchers, with Jaime Garcia also on	the 15-day disabled list with a left shoulder strain, but haven't	let it slow them down.	"We've got to pick it up but with the talent we have, it	doesn't demand much," Freese said. "The guys we have in Double-A	and Triple-A, they're waiting and they're hungry and they're	expected to do well."	Edward Mujica earned his 13th save in 13 chances after a third	rookie, Trevor Rosenthal, gave up a hit in the eighth.	Lohse (1-5) left in free agency when the Cardinals opted to go	with younger players such as Shelby Miller and save salary. He gave	up four runs in six innings, and is 0-4 overall in his last five	starts.	Yuniesky Betancourt and Jeff Bianchi each drove in a run and	Norichika Aoki had three hits and a walk for the Brewers, who have	lost 14 of 17. They didn't have much to show for 10 hits and	wrapped up a 2-8 trip.	"There were a lot of story lines out of our road trip," said	Ryan Braun, who grounded into a double play with the bases loaded	to end the seventh. "And none of them good."	After getting one hit the first time through the order, the	Cardinals jumped on Lohse for six hits in the first seven at-bats	in the fourth. Yadier Molina singled for the lead and Jon Jay	followed with an RBI double, both coming on first pitches.	Freese's opposite-field single through a drawn-in infield was	his fifth RBI of the series after totaling four prior to the	weekend, and Kozma capped the rally with a perfectly-placed squeeze	bunt that Lohse couldn't touch with a diving barehanded attempt.	Gast has opened with five scoreless innings in each of his first	two career starts, and has allowed a total of six runs in the	sixth.	"I made a few mistakes in the sixth," Gast said. "It's	something to keep an eye on, but I don't think two starts is a big	enough sample size to make any conclusions."	Maness took over with one out and runners at the corners, and	the Brewers got two-out RBIs from Betancourt and Bianchi to cut the	deficit to 4-2.	Maness finished with a unique pitching line, allowing no runs on	five hits in 1 2-3 innings. According to baseballreference.com,	he's the ninth pitcher since 1916 to give up five hits and get five	outs without allowing a run, and the first since Eric Gunderson of	Seattle in 2000.	"I'm a ground-ball pitcher and that happens sometimes," Maness	said. "It's never fun but you've just got to focus and know you're	another ground ball away from trying to get out of it."	The Brewers opened the seventh with three straight hits and had	two of their best hitters due up. Jean Segura, who entered with an	NL-leading .361 average, popped up to first and Braun grounded into	a double play on a full count on a play started by Freese.	Aoki was barely run down at the plate by Freese to foil a	double-steal attempt and end the first. The Brewers attempted to	manufacture a run with Betancourt down 1-2 in the count while mired	in a 3 for 40 slump. Freese faked a few tosses to the plate before	flicking his glove to catch Aoki beginning his dive.	Freese cut his right thumb on Aoki's spikes at the end of the	play and got a few stitches after the game, but didn't think it	would keep him down.	"I've had plenty of stitches over my days, so we'll be all	right," Freese said. "It's a cut. Toughen up a few minutes here,	a few minutes there."	Game notes	 Aoki is 16 for 30 (.533) his last seven games with four	three-hit games and is batting .410 (16 for 39) against the	Cardinals. ... Jay has 15 RBIs his last 15 games. ...The Cardinals	are 14-7 on the road heading into an eight game trip. Miller (5-2,	1.40) is tied for the major league lead in ERA heading into	Monday's start against Jason Marquis (5-2, 3.49) at San Diego. ...	The Brewers begin an eight-game home stand Monday with Yovani	Gallardo (3-3, 4.50) facing the Dodgers' Clayton Kershaw (4-2,	1.40). ... Professional wrestler Chris Jericho, in town for an	"extreme rules" event Sunday night, threw the ceremonial first	pitch. ... Milwaukee's Rickie Weeks struck out twice for a	four-game total of eight and is batting .170.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

CHICAGO -- The New York Mets wanted more pop up top, and hoped Daniel Murphy could provide it.	He delivered, hitting a tiebreaking home run in the eighth inning that sent the Mets over the Chicago Cubs 4-3 on Sunday for their first series win at Wrigley Field since 2007.	The Mets won two of three on this trip to Chicago.	Murphy batted leadoff for the first time this season and fifth time in his career. He'd mostly been in the second slot this season.	"It's still always about quality at-bats," Murphy said.	Murphy hit a leadoff shot against reliever Kyuji Fujikawa (1-1). Murphy has homered twice in three games and has an eight-game hitting streak, during which he's batted .469 (15 for 32) with seven extra-base hits.	Manager Terry Collins indicated Murphy might remain in the leadoff spot.	"I feel like I'm taking better swings," Murphy said. "I feel better with my swing. I'm also getting better pitches to hit. When your swing is going good, you feel comfortable at the plate. You just don't miss them. That's kind of where I'm at."	Mets rookie Juan Lagares hit his first major league homer, a tying, two-run drive in the seventh against starter Travis Wood.	"I wish I could have that pitch back," Wood said. "I went with a changeup, was trying to get it down and happened to leave it up. He put a good swing on it and hit it out."	Lagares planned to keep the baseball, which a fan threw back onto the field.	"When I came here I just tried to keep doing the same thing I was doing in Triple-A," Lagares said. "The key is to keep working hard."	Scott Rice (2-3) pitched two scoreless innings. Bobby Parnell earned his sixth save.	Wood hit his first homer of the season and fourth of his career, clearing the left-field bleachers with a two-run drive off Dillon Gee in the fifth to end a scoreless tie.	"I felt like I located fairly well today, other than a couple pitches that really hurt me," Gee said. "Wood hitting the home run kind of surprised me because I was throwing so many sliders to him. It was like he was sitting on the fastball as soon as it left my hand."	Wood made his ninth straight quality start, allowing three runs and five hits in seven innings. He struck out three and walked two. The last Cubs starter to begin a season with at least nine straight quality starts was Mordecai "Three Finger" Brown in 1908.	"Wood was throwing the ball well today," Murphy said. "He didn't make a whole lot of mistakes. The one that did, Juan did a great job capitalizing on it. It was an awesome first home run."	The Mets cut the lead to 2-1 in the sixth on a walk to Gee, a forceout, a wild pitch and an RBI single by David Wright.	The Cubs extended their lead to 3-1 in the bottom half on Ryan Sweeney's leadoff homer. It was his first home run since July 27, 2011, when he played for Oakland.	Gee allowed three runs and eight hits in five innings. He has allowed nine runs in his last nine innings and hasn't won since May 1.	"When he's making his pitches with his changeup, which is his No. 1 pitch anyway, he's effective," Collins said.	Sweeney tried to stretch a leadoff double into a triple in the fourth but was thrown out at third. The Cubs also had leadoff doubles in the first and fifth.	Games Notes: The Cubs announced reliever Michael Bowden will be designated for assignment to make room for RHP Matt Garza, who is coming off the disabled list on Tuesday. ... Cubs 1B Anthony Rizzo struck out in the first inning, ending 39 straight at-bats without a strikeout. ... Cubs RHP Carlos Villanueva was available. He moved to the bullpen to make room for Garza, who will make his season debut on Tuesday against Pittsburgh. Garza strained a back muscle in spring training. Villanueva (1-3) hasn't won since April 18. He has made 245 of his 309 career appearances as a reliever.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Jason Vargas kept throwing strikes and catcher Chris Iannetta kept taking his walks -- a winning formula for the Los Angeles Angels on Sunday.	Vargas scattered four hits through seven scoreless innings, Erick Aybar and Howie Kendrick each hit two-run doubles, and the Los Angeles Angels coaxed a pair of bases-loaded walks out of Jake Peavy in the fourth inning of a 6-2 victory over the Chicago White Sox.	Vargas (3-3) struck out six and walked three while helping the Angels gain a split of the four-game series. The middle of the Chicago lineup -- Alex Rios, Adam Dunn and Paul Konerko -- was a combined 0 for 8 with a walk against the left-hander, who posted his first victory in six career starts against the White Sox.	"When you've got three guys like that in a lineup, the biggest key is just to try and keep guys off base when they come up to the plate because it limits the damage that they're able to do," Vargas said. "When you can do that, you have more confidence in what you can go about doing with them, and there's more room for error."	Peavy (5-2) gave up four runs, four hits and five walks over six innings after going 4-0 with a 2.10 ERA in his previous five starts. The 2007 NL Cy Young winner is 0-4 with a 6.06 ERA in six career starts against the Angels.	"I felt really good today, and that's the most frustrating part for me," Peavy said. "I went out there with a good game plan and felt like we could execute, but I just didn't quite execute well enough. My slider was the best it's been all year, so I've got some positives to take out of it. It's just hard to be positive right now."	Los Angeles opened the scoring in the third when Iannetta drew a leadoff walk, J.B. Shuck followed with a single and Aybar drove both of them in with his double to right before he was erased in a rundown.	"Obviously the walks are going to kill you, especially leading off an inning. There's no excuse for that," Peavy said. "I have all the respect in the world for Chris Iannetta. He's got a great eye, there's no doubt about it. But good eye or nothing, I've got to throw the ball where he has to swing the bat."	Peavy, who threw 83 of his 117 pitches in the first four innings, walked four more batters in the fourth -- including Iannetta and Aybar with the bases loaded -- and the Angels increased the margin to 4-0. Two innings later, Peavy struck out the side on 18 pitches.	Iannetta's second walk was his 14th in a span of 33 plate appearances, including four on Saturday. He has 27 overall, just two fewer than he had last season in 221 plate appearances. His career high is 70, with Colorado in 2011.	"He's walking a lot," manager Mike Scioscia said. "I mean, if you look at Chris' history, there's no doubt the walk is in his game. Even when he was going through that little rough spot earlier in the season, he still drew some walks. I think it's great plate discipline, especially when you're not swinging the bat that well."	Rios drove in Chicago's first run with an eighth-inning double against Dane De La Rosa. It extended his hitting streak to 14 games, eclipsing his previous best in 2006 with Toronto.	Ernesto Frieri was called in to protect a 4-1 lead, trying to get his second four-out save in two days after giving up a three-run homer in the eighth against Hector Gimenez on Saturday before closing that one out.	The right-hander walked three batters in the ninth this time before notching his ninth save in 10 attempts overall. Frieri gave up a sacrifice fly by Alejandro De Aza before retiring Alexei Ramirez on a flyball to end it.	Kendrick gave Frieri a couple of insurance runs in the eighth with his double inside third base against rookie Brian Omogrosso.	Game notes	 Peavy had issued eight walks in 45 2/3 innings over his seven previous starts this season. The three-time All-Star, who led the NL in strikeouts in 2005 and 2007 with San Diego, got the 1,800th of his career in the first inning when he caught Mike Trout looking. ... INF Chris Nelson was added to the Angels' 25-man roster, one day after he was claimed off waivers from the New York Yankees. They are the third team he's been with this season, including Colorado. ... The Angels optioned 3B Luis Jimenez to Triple-A Salt Lake, and sent outright RHP Barry Enright to Salt Lake after he cleared waivers. Enright had been designated for assignment on May 16, one day after giving up four runs in two-plus innings against Kansas City in a 9-5 loss. ... Dunn returned to the lineup as the designated hitter, after leaving Saturday's game in the fifth inning because of back spasms. He finished 0 for 3 with three strikeouts and a walk. ... The White Sox return home to start an eight-game homestand on Monday against Boston.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  Three straight one-run wins and a series sweep of slumping Kansas City might be just the thing to get the Oakland Athletics going again.	A late tiebreaking home run from Yoenis Cespedes helps, too.	Cespedes hit a leadoff homer in the eighth inning and the A's beat the Royals 4-3 to move back over .500.	"I would rather see us win by 10 runs ... but it makes for a little bit more excitement, certainly at the end," Oakland manager Bob Melvin said. "What it does for me more than anything is it shows some tenacity that when you get down, you don't worry about it."	Jerry Blevins (3-0) pitched one scoreless inning. Ryan Cook worked the ninth for his first save of the season.	Cespedes hit his eighth homer, connecting against Kelvin Herrera (2-4). Cespedes also singled and scored the A's first run in the second.	Held in check by Kansas City starter Luis Mendoza most of the afternoon, Oakland benefited from a costly error by center fielder David Lough that allowed the tying run to score in the seventh.	Derek Norris hit a leadoff single and raced to third when the ball skipped over Lough's glove and rolled to the fence. One batter later Coco Crisp's sacrifice fly tied it.	"I kind of hesitated, pulled up and it took one of those sharp hops and just got by me on the top of my glove," Lough said. "If I would have went for it I would have caught it in the air, for sure."	Still, Oakland's first sweep of the Royals since 2008 didn't come easily.	The A's squeaked out a pair of 2-1 wins on Friday and Saturday, then had to sweat out another tight finish in the series finale.	Cook, pitching because closer Grant Balfour was unavailable, allowed two-out singles to Billy Butler and Eric Hosmer in the ninth. Mike Moustakas then worked a full count off Cook before grounding out to end the game.	"Any time you can get three wins and sweep a team that's playing pretty decent baseball, it doesn't really matter how you do it," Norris said. "It's definitely a plus for us."	Alex Gordon matched his career high of four hits for Kansas City. The Royals have lost 10 of 13 and fallen back to .500.	Gordon hit an RBI single in the third, scored in the fifth and doubled in the seventh. Since moving to the third spot in the lineup on May 9, Gordon is batting .450 (18 for 40).	The Royals, who scored just two runs and stranded 11 baserunners in the first two games of this series, went up 2-0 when Chris Getz singled in Hosmer in the fourth. Hosmer added an RBI double in the fifth.	A's starter A.J. Griffin had command problems most of the day. He walked three and struck out five but failed in his bid to become the second pitcher in Oakland history to reach 12 wins in his first 24 starts.	Josh Donaldson had a sacrifice fly in the Oakland fourth and Jed Lowrie had an RBI single in the fifth.	Game notes	 Each of the A's last 12 home runs have been solo shots, the second-longest such streak in Oakland history. ... Mendoza struck out four and didn't walk a batter for a second straight start. ... Gordon had 60 multihit games in 2012 but already has 20 in the Royals first 40 games this season. He has nine career four-hit games. ... Injured Oakland OF Josh Reddick continues to make slow progress from surgery on his right wrist. He was out Sunday after taking swings off a tee the previous day and is eligible to come off the disabled list Wednesday, though manager Bob Melvin thinks Reddick will need more time to heal. ... Kansas City RHP Jeremy Guthrie (5-1) pitches the series opener in Houston and is seeking to rebound from his first loss of the season. ... A's RHP Bartolo Colon (3-2), who takes the hill against Texas on Monday, is winless in his last four starts.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN DIEGO --  After losing to Stephen Strasburg on Thursday night and then blowing an extra-inning game Friday night, the San Diego Padres righted themselves rather nicely against the defending NL East champion Washington Nationals.	Andrew Cashner pitched 6 2/3 strong innings and Kyle Blanks and Will Venable homered off Dan Haren to lead the Padres to a 13-4 victory Sunday and a split of their four-game series.	"It's huge. They have probably one of the best rotations in baseball, let alone lineups," Cashner said. "That's a really, really good team over there. After we lost the first two we definitely played better the last two games."	After Eric Stults outpitched Jordan Zimmermann on Saturday night, the Padres got to Haren early on Sunday. The Padres tied their season high in runs and their 15 hits against four Nationals pitchers were two short of their season high.	"It was good to bounce back in beating Zimmermann, who is arguably the best pitcher in the National League right now. That was a big win last night," San Diego manager Bud Black said.	"Then to come back today against Haren, who's a great competitor. We got to him early and got him there in the middle part of the game with a couple big swings. Good for our guys. It was a good win."	San Diego's Yonder Alonso homered off Drew Storen leading off the eighth to finish 3 for 4 with two RBIs and three runs scored. It was his sixth homer.	Everth Cabrera and rookie Jedd Gyorko each had two hits, two RBIs and two runs scored. Cabrera had three stolen bases to give him a major league-leading 18.	"We're swinging really good right now and we're seeing the ball so good right now," Cabrera said. "It feels great. I'm happy."	Cashner (3-2) allowed three runs and seven hits, struck out six and walked one.	He retired the first seven Nationals batters and the Padres jumped on Haren for three runs in the first.	"Cash carried that momentum all the way through the game," Black said. "I thought he did a nice job with the fastball-change combination. He wobbled very little. I thought he was in control of the game and pitched very well."	The Nationals have lost six of nine.	Haren (4-5) got off to a rough start by allowing three runs in the first inning and was gone after the fourth-run fifth. Haren allowed nine hits while striking out five and walking two.	With the Padres leading 3-2, Venable opened the fifth with a shot deep into the stands in right field, his sixth. Haren retired the next two batters before Alonso doubled to left-center and scored on Gyorko's single to left.	Blanks then lined Haren's next pitch an estimated 383 feet off the side of the Western Metal Supply Co. brick warehouse in the left-field corner for a 7-2 lead. It was his third.	"Way too many mistakes," Haren said. "I didn't feel good out there. I didn't have much. I made a bunch of mistakes in the first inning. I kept it close for a while but you can't keep leaving balls out over the plate to a professional lineup. I kept fighting myself. I was working behind in the count too much, which is a recipe for disaster."	The Padres scored three runs against Haren in the first on three hits and a walk. Carlos Quentin and Gyorko had RBI doubles and Alonso a sacrifice fly.	The Nationals pulled to 3-2 in the fourth on Ryan Zimmerman's two-run homer that went an estimated 414 feet into the second deck in left, his third. Stephen Lombardozzi was aboard on a leadoff infield single after his hard smash went off Cashner's glove. Cashner was knocked backward by the impact. He stayed in the game.	The Padres scored five runs on four hits, two walks and a sacrifice fly off Ryan Mattheus in the seventh. Cabrera had a two-run single.	"Very disappointing," Washington manager Davey Johnson said. "I hate to even talk about that one today. We didn't pitch very well. We got back in the ballgame but Haren obviously didn't have his stuff. The bullpen didn't do it. Tough day."	Game notes	 The Padres had a season-high five stolen bases. ... Washington's Adam LaRoche hit an RBI single in the seventh to extend his career-best hitting streak to 16 games. ... Nationals OF Bryce Harper sat out a second straight game with a bruised left knee from his collision with the right-field wall at Dodger Stadium last Monday night. .... Haren's poor start ended a string of nine consecutive games in which Washington starters allowed two or fewer earned runs. ... The Nationals open a three-game series at San Francisco on Monday night. LHP Zach Duke (0-0, 8.40) is scheduled to start against RHP Ryan Vogelsong (1-4, 8.06). Duke is slated to make his first start since July 10, 2011, at St. Louis. ... The Padres continue their homestand with a three-game series against St. Louis that starts Monday night. The Cardinals are scheduled to start RHP Shelby Miller (5-2, 1.40) vs. RHP Jason Marquis (5-2, 3.49).	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DENVER --  Juan Nicasio went from erratic all season to electric again simply by following orders.	Before the game, veteran catcher Yorvit Torrealba told the young pitcher to "pound the strike zone." No cute or fancy stuff, just throw whatever Torrealba told him to throw.	Nicasio paid attention and prospered.	The righty scattered three hits over six innings, Carlos Gonzalez and Troy Tulowitzki each drove in two runs and the Colorado Rockies won their first series over San Francisco in two years, beating the Giants 5-0 on Sunday.	"That's what everybody was waiting for from him," said Gonzalez, whose team took three of four from the reigning World Series champions. "Before, all those pitches he was making in a game, it was really hard for him to get out of the fifth. Tonight, it was a different story."	Since it was his first time catching the inconsistent Nicasio this season, Torrealba had a brief pregame meeting with him. In their talk, he just reminded him to throw strikes and "whatever I put down, you throw."	Nicasio (4-1) wasn't about to disobey Torrealba.	"He called for a lot of breaking balls, in situations for me where I want to throw fastball," Nicasio said. "He told me, 'No, breaking ball or sinker.' "	By following Torrealba's instructions, Nicasio shut down one of the top-hitting teams in baseball. He struck out five and allowed only an intentional walk before being lifted for a pinch hitter in the sixth. It was only the third time in nine starts the righty has thrown at least six innings.	Before Sunday, Nicasio had labored in games, throwing way too many pitches that led to early exits. He was pretty much pitching to keep his spot in the rotation, especially on the heels of Tyler Chatwood's solid performance the previous day. Nicasio could be the odd starter out when Jeff Francis returns from the disabled list at the end of the month.	More outings like this only boost Nicasio's case to remain in the rotation. Not that he's thinking along those lines.	"I didn't have pressure," he insisted. "When I go to pitch, I'm focused. I want to do my job, throw strikes."	He worked his way out of a sticky situation in the sixth -- with the assistance of Torrealba, of course.	With two outs and two on, Torrealba paid a visit to the mound when Brandon Belt ran the count to 3-2. Torrealba told Nicasio to throw a slider down and away.	Nicasio did just that -- even though the pitcher wanted to throw a sinker down the middle -- and struck out Belt.	So elated was Nicasio that he skipped off the mound and pumped his fist before making his way into the dugout to an ovation from the crowd.	Torrealba was beaming, too.	"He can pitch on this level," Torrealba said. "Today, he showed it. If he pounds the strike zone, he's fine."	Dexter Fowler tied a career high with four hits and Jordan Pacheco also drove in a run as Colorado captured its first series against San Francisco since May 16-17, 2011, at Coors Field.	Gregor Blanco and Brandon Crawford each had two hits. Pinch-hitter Joaquin Arias had the other as the Giants lost their third in a row to the Rockies after beating them 10 straight times.	The Giants concluded a six-game road swing with a 1-5 mark in which their starting pitching fizzled and their defense faltered. The starters had a 9.82 ERA and the fielders committed 13 errors on the trip.	This is far from the norm for the Giants, whose rotation was so dependable in winning the World Series last season.	"We're going to have our off days and we're going to be bad," manager Bruce Bochy explained. "It's a temporary thing. You don't have the success we've had and not be good, these pitchers. Have to remind themselves how good they are."	Barry Zito (3-3) turned in a second straight ineffective outing. He allowed 11 hits and five runs in 5 2/3 innings.	The lefty struggled on Tuesday in Toronto when he surrendered eight runs -- five earned -- in 5 2/3 innings. He was looking to get back on track against Colorado, a team he hadn't lost to since Sept. 25, 2008.	"I've given up quite a few hits the last couple of games," Zito said. "It doesn't feel good to be allowing all those base runners, but at the same time battling out of innings is encouraging."	The Rockies pounced on Zito early, scoring a run in the first when Gonzalez singled home Eric Young Jr.	Colorado opened a 3-0 lead in the fifth on an RBI double by Gonzalez and a run-scoring single from Pacheco. Tulowitzki added some insurance with a two-run single an inning later off Jose Mijares, who came in for Zito.	"We've just got to keep fighting and we'll come out of it," Zito said of the team's slump.	Bochy elected to rest two of his hottest hitters, catcher Buster Posey and infielder Marco Scutaro. It was a particularly difficult decision for Bochy to keep Scutaro out of the lineup since he's in the midst of a 17-game hitting streak.	"He's been on a great run here," Bochy said. "Sometimes, you've got to give him a break."	Game notes	 Giants 2B Nick Noonan collided with Gonzalez on a pick-off attempt in the third, hurting his collarbone.  Noonan stayed in the game. "I think he's fine," Bochy said.  ... CF Angel Pagan left in the fifth with the flu. "He wasn't feeling all that good and it caught up with him during the game," Bochy said. ... The Rockies gave away 20,000 Dante Bichette bobblehead dolls on Sunday. Bichette, the team's hitting coach, also threw out the first pitch. ... Manager Walt Weiss attended his son's high school graduation Sunday before arriving at the park.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  David Murphy's three-run shot was barely enough against Miguel Cabrera's three home runs.	Murphy put Texas ahead for good with a drive just over the wall in right field in the sixth inning, and the Rangers spoiled the second three-homer game of Cabrera's career with an 11-8 victory on Sunday night.	"Very nice to be on the winning side," Murphy said. "Big game, fun game, national TV. We got to witness the best hitter in the game hit three homers."	Cabrera hit a three-run homer in the third and a solo shot in the fifth off Derek Holland, then went deep again in the eighth against Tanner Scheppers.	Cabrera, the 2012 AL Triple Crown winner and this year's leader in average and RBIs, went 4 for 4 with 5 RBIs and has 11 homers, one off the AL lead.	Still, the Tigers lost three of four to the Rangers, who won a four-game series for the first time after twice losing with a chance to do it.	"I've never seen a guy that puts the bat head on the ball as regular as he does, and on all pitches," Rangers manager Ron Washington said. "He's just a tremendous hitter. I'm very happy that he's headed to the airport."	Murphy's homer gave the Rangers an 8-7 lead and answered a bases-loaded double from Prince Fielder that put Detroit up by two after the Rangers had walked Cabrera intentionally even though first base wasn't open.	The go-ahead shot came against Jose Ortega (0-1), who hadn't allowed a run in six relief appearances covering seven innings.	"He got me down 0-2, and I was basically in battle mode to do whatever I could to prolong the at-bat and get anything done in that situation," Murphy said.	Robbie Ross (2-0) pitched a scoreless seventh inning for the win, and Joe Nathan worked around a leadoff walk in the ninth for his 13th save. He has saved all 36 career chances against Detroit.	The Tigers led 4-1 after Cabrera hit a three-run homer over the Texas bullpen in right-center field in the third and added a solo shot to center off Holland, who had given up just two homers in 57-plus innings this year after setting a club record by allowing 32 homers last year.	The Rangers had wiped out that lead -- and another one after Fielder's double -- and were ahead 11-7 when Cabrera hit another solo homer to center off Scheppers.	"You don't feel very good when guys hit three home runs and you lose the game," Detroit manager Jim Leyland said. "Miggy never ceases to amaze you. I also take my hat off to Prince Fielder for that situation against a left-handed pitcher. Between the two of them, that was impressive."	The Rangers overcame Detroit's early lead with a four-run fifth highlighted by a pop fly double from Adrian Beltre that scored two and gave Texas a 5-4 lead.	Beltre went 4 for 5 with two doubles -- both of them bloopers -- and Geovany Soto and Lance Berkman had three hits apiece for the Rangers, who matched their season high with 18 hits.	Soto, who came in hitting .185, went 3 for 5 for the Rangers and had a fourth hit taken away when Andy Dirks caught a long drive to center while crashing into the wall.	Dirks' catch on Soto ended a string of six straight Texas batters reaching in the sixth against Ortega (0-1), who had allowed only five base runners this season.	Soto started both Texas rallies with leadoff hits in the fifth and sixth innings, when the Rangers scored eight of their runs.	The light-hitting catcher had a double to start the fifth and scored on a groundout by Elvis Andrus. Murphy, who also had a sacrifice fly, walked and Berkman drove in Craig Gentry with a single before Beltre's second double, which slipped out of Detroit shortstop Jhonny Peralta's glove just inside the left-field line.	Washington scrambled to protect a 5-4 lead in the sixth, finally ordering reliever Jason Frasor to walk Cabrera with runners at first and second when he got behind 3-1. Washington brought in left-hander Michael Kirkman to face Fielder, but the lefty slugger ripped his second double to the wall in center field.	Soto started the sixth with a single, and Andrus walked with one out before Murphy pulled a pitch from Ortega to right to put Texas ahead for good.	"Neither team quit fighting," Washington said. "It was a very good ballgame. It didn't matter what you tried to do. Each team came back, and we got the final blow and were able to sustain."	Holland and Detroit starter Doug Fister both went just 4 2/3 innings, the shortest outing of the year for Holland. The left-hander gave up eight hits and four runs with three walks and six strikeouts. Fister allowed nine hits and five runs.	Game notes	 Cabrera hit three homers on May 28, 2010, at home against Oakland. ... Rangers 2B Ian Kinsler went on the 15-day disabled list with bruised ribs, and top prospect Jurickson Profar was brought up from Triple-A Round Rock. Leury Garcia made his third straight start in Kinsler's place at second. ... Rangers C A.J. Pierzynski caught five innings in the first game of a rehab assignment at Double-A Frisco on Sunday. He went 0 for 3 with a strikeout and two groundouts. Pierzynski will catch RHP Colby Lewis' rehab start with Frisco on Monday.

Indians 10, Mariners 8. New approach.	By TOM WITHERS	AP Sports Writer	CLEVELAND --  Chris Perez was stunned, surprised and shocked.	And he was hardly alone.	The Cleveland Indians somehow pulled out a game they had no business winning.	"Best game I've ever been a part of," said Perez. "It was the craziest, most fun ... obviously, it stunk to give up a home run, but it was still fun."	Yan Gomes hit a three-run homer in the 10th inning as the Indians, revived by Seattle fielding errors in the final two innings, beat the Mariners 10-8 on Monday to complete a four-game sweep and continue a season that's shaping into one to remember in Cleveland.	Gomes, who also homered in the second, drove a 3-2 pitch from Charlie Furbush (0-3) over the wall in left, giving the Indians their fifth straight win, third walk-off over the Mariners in four days, and one of the most improbable victories in memory.	As Gomes reached the plate, he was mobbed by his teammates following the comeback that became necessary after Cleveland's bullpen gave up homers in the eighth, ninth and 10th innings.	"You don't look up very often and see your opponent score three straight innings and you win," Indians manager Terry Francona said. "That was interesting."	Incredible, really.	It was the Indians' first four-game sweep of Seattle since 1981, and the rally gave Cleveland its 18th win in 22 games.	Joe Smith (2-0) won despite giving up a go-ahead homer to Justin Smoak in the 10th and the Indians improved to a major league-best 21-7 since April 20.	Ryan Raburn hit a three-run homer for Cleveland, which opened a 2 1-2 game lead over the Detroit Tigers in the AL Central. The teams play a two-game series starting Tuesday.	The Mariners got a tying homer by Kyle Seager in the eighth off Vinnie Pestano and a go-ahead shot by pinch-hitter Endy Chavez in the ninth off Perez, but couldn't close it out because of their own miscues.	"It was another weird game," Mariners manager Eric Wedge said. "We're just on the south side of things right now."	The Indians were an out away from losing in the ninth when Seattle closer Tom Wilhelmsen dropped an underhanded toss while covering first, allowing the Indians to tie it at 7.	After Smoak homered in the 10th, the Indians were three outs away from losing when the Mariners helped them again.	Michael Brantley singled and Drew Stubbs followed with a bunt that Furbush, seeking his first career save, fielded but bobbled. The left-hander rushed his throw to first and would have had Stubbs -- umpire Tim Timmons called him out -- but Smoak dropped the ball.	Gomes then delivered his game-winning homer, taking an unexpected trip around the bases after it looked as if the Indians were finished.	"Moments like that, you just want to get back to your teammates," said Gomes, "just run around and make sure you don't miss a base. It was exciting. You just don't know what to do with your hands. I was like, `Wow, this game's done."	It was another sign of resiliency by the Indians.	"You're supposed to play `til they send you home," Francona said. "It's a good feeling. Once you do it a few times I think that breeds some confidence. Whether it's picking each other up,  it's getting contagious, and that's good."	The final three innings bordered on the absurd as the Mariners took the lead only to give it away with bone-headed plays.	"We kept coming back and kept taking the lead," Wedge said. "We weren't able to make plays or make pitches when we needed to late. We weren't able to finish things off."	Wilhelmsen's error in the ninth not only cost the Mariners a certain win, but it allowed Perez to escape a loss after he gave up the homer to Chavez. It was another bad outing for Perez, who allowed back-to-back homers in the ninth on Saturday but wound up getting a win.	"I didn't my job today, but you can't feel sorry for yourself or hang your head," said Perez, who has managed to keep his sense of humor despite the rough outings. The only runs I've given up this year have been solo home runs. Maybe if I can walk the leadoff hitter, we'd be all right."	With Seattle trailing 6-5 in the eighth, Seager homered off Pestano, who recently came off the disabled list, into the Mariners' bullpen for his fifth homer.	The Indians took a 6-5 lead in the seventh off Yoervis Medina without hitting the ball beyond the infield grass. Starter Hisashi Iwakuma was tagged by the Indians for five runs in four innings, but the right-hander settled in and retired the final seven hitters he faced. He gave up seven hits and struck out six in six innings.	Indians starter Scott Kazmir didn't get out of the fourth as the teams combined for 10 runs and 14 hits through four innings. Raburn and Gomes hit back-to-back, two-out homers in the second, when the Indians caught a break to take a 4-2 lead.	With Carlos Santana on with a one-out double, Mark Reynolds just missed a homer, flying out to the track in left. Brantley walked and Raburn fell into an 0-2 hole and appeared to take strike three, but plate umpire Laz Diaz called Iwakuma's pitch a ball to give Raburn new life.	He made the most of it, connecting for his fifth homer to make it 3-2. Gomes followed with a shot onto the pedestrian porch in left.	Game notes	  The Indians are 10-1 against the AL West. ...

TORONTO --  With every outing, R.A. Dickey feels he's getting closer to his Cy Young Award form of last season.	Dickey won his second straight start, Edwin Encarnacion hit a tiebreaking, bases-loaded double in the seventh inning, and the Toronto Blue Jays beat the Tampa Bay Rays 7-5 Monday.	"I've felt like I've been stuck in a quagmire for the last week, two weeks," Dickey said. "So it's nice to feel like you've got at least one foot out of it.	"I'm not going to say I feel great," Dickey continued. "I've had a few maladies over the season, and I'm hopeful to continue to progress. But I'm not all the way there yet."	Dickey (4-5) allowed three runs -- two earned -- and four hits in a season-high eight innings as the Blue Jays won their fourth straight home game. The reigning NL Cy Young  winner walked four and struck out five.	"You look forward to when he takes the mound," Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said.	Dickey has walked 28 batters in 62 innings this season. He walked 54 in 233 2/3 innings while pitching for the New York Mets last year.	"Still walking more guys than I hope to, which is causing my pitch counts to be higher," Dickey said. "You've just got to keep grinding it out."	Casey Janssen gave up a two-run homer to former Toronto shortstop Yunel Escobar in the ninth. Booed by the crowd of 29,885, Escobar thumped his chest and made an exaggerated safe sign as he crossed the plate, prompting more jeers.	"I'm sure that was an emotional moment for him," Rays manager Joe Maddon said. "The booing probably promoted the reaction that he had. I'm going to talk to him about that tomorrow. I'm certain you're not going to see that again."	Janssen said he hadn't noticed Escobar's gesture, and said he wasn't bothered by it.	"I don't think it was directed at me," Janssen said. "We were good teammates, I had no problem with him. He had no problem with me. I did hear the chorus of boos and I'm sure he was a little frustrated at times. He's an emotional guy, he's a prideful guy. It was his moment to shine and he did his thing.	Desmond Jennings followed with a single and Matt Joyce walked, bringing the potential go-ahead run to the plate, but Janssen struck out Ben Zobrist on three pitches to end it.	Encarnacion doubled in the seventh after Josh Lueke (0-1) walked the bases loaded around a sacrifice and a flyout. Encarnacion's hit off the left-field wall ricocheted past outfielder Sam Fuld, allowing all three runners to score.	Munenori Kawasaki hit a two-out RBI triple off Kyle Farnsworth in the eighth.	Making his Rays debut and just his third major league start, right-hander Jake Odorizzi allowed three runs and five hits in five innings. He walked one, struck out a career-high six and retired 10 of his final 11 batters.	"Starting off I just couldn't get in a groove," Odorizzi said. "Once I did, it felt good."	Henry Blanco hit a one-out double in the second and was called safe by C.B. Bucknor even though replays appeared to show he was tagged out by second baseman Ben Zobrist. One out later, Melky Cabrera hit an RBI double to right.	"If Zobrist is going to argue, I have to believe that Zobrist is right," Maddon said. "If Ben Zobrist argues, my God, I'm going every time."	Rays third baseman Evan Longoria went 2 for 4 with two RBIs and extended his hitting streak to 14 games.	Game notes	 Dickey started with an extra day of rest after Sunday's game at Yankee Stadium was rained out. ... Toronto recalled OF Anthony Gose from Buffalo and optioned RHP Mickey Storey to Triple-A. Gose came in as a defensive replacement for Cabrera in the eighth. ... Odorizzi started for the Rays in place of LHP David Price, who is on the 15-day DL with a strained left triceps. ... Odorizzi is the 17th starter used by the Rays since the beginning of the 2008 season, the fewest in the majors. San Francisco has used the next fewest, at 20. ... Toronto is 14-0 when scoring five or more runs.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

BALTIMORE --  A tense AL East duel between the New York Yankees and Baltimore Orioles revealed the strengths and weaknesses of each team.	After the Yankees beat the Orioles 6-4 in 10 innings Monday night to extend Baltimore's losing streak to six games, it became apparent why New York leads the division and Baltimore is mired in its longest skid in nearly a year.	Both showed their hitting prowess. Both played solid defense. The difference was that the Orioles got another poor performance from the back end of their bullpen, and New York got a typically strong outing from closer Mariano Rivera.	New York trailed 4-3 in the ninth before Travis Hafner homered with one out on a 3-1 pitch from Jim Johnson, who has blown three straight save opportunities after converting a franchise-record 35 in a row. All three of those botched saves have come during Baltimore's current slide.	Pedro Strop then gave up two runs in the 10th to complete the collapse. After that, Rivera breezed through a 1-2-3 inning for his 17th save in 17 tries.	"Believe me, I don't take him for granted," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said of Rivera. "It's hard to do it year after year after year. You're going to see guys go through some ups and downs, but Mo doesn't go through a lot."	Neither did Johnson until last week, when he blew ninth-inning leads against San Diego and Tampa Bay before collapsing against the Yankees.	"The ball's up. That seems to be the common thing lately," Johnson said. "Just not making the adjustment. I'm trying, you know, doing everything. I'm going to work through it."	Rivera, on the other hand, has been darn near perfect. And that is why the Yankees are 28-16 and Baltimore is five games back, as close to last place as first.	The Yankees also improved to 19-0 when scoring first this season.	"All bullpens are going to go through their struggles," Girardi said. "The bottom line is that we were able to get some runs off some pretty good pitchers tonight."	Robinson Cano hit his team-high 13th home run in the first inning for New York, David Adams clubbed his first major-league homer in the second and Lyle Overbay connected in the seventh.	In the 10th, Ichiro Suzuki led off with a double off Strop (0-2) and Vernon Wells followed with an RBI double to left. Hafner added a two-out single to make it 6-4.	David Robertson (3-0) worked the ninth as part of a relief crew that allowed two hits and no runs in 3 2/3 innings. Their effort followed an uneven performance by starter CC Sabathia.	Asked to assess the bullpen's performance, Sabathia said, "Unbelievable, but that's just been all year. We knew that was a strong point of our team, but they've really carried us. They've been great."	After Overbay put New York up 3-2 in the seventh with a homer off Troy Patton, Baltimore took the lead in the bottom half. Alexi Casilla singled and scored on a double by Nick Markakis, who came home on an opposite-field double to right by J.J. Hardy.	Orioles manager Buck Showalter elevated Hardy to the third spot in the lineup because the shortstop came in with a .321 career batting average against Sabathia. Hardy also doubled in the fifth against the big left-hander.	"We had the lead and it's up to me to go out and shut the door," Sabathia said. "It's very frustrating, especially in a close game like this. Luckily, these guys were able to bail me out."	Sabathia gave up four runs and 11 hits in 6 1/3 innings. He left with New York trailing 4-3, but Hafner's shot in the ninth preserved Sabathia's 17-4 lifetime record against Baltimore.	Orioles starter Freddy Garcia, who pitched the past two years for the Yankees, allowed two runs, three hits -- two homers and a meaningless single -- in six innings. Aided by two double plays, the right-hander faced only three batters over the minimum.	Cano and Adams provided the Yankees with a 2-0 lead before Chris Davis hit his 13th homer for Baltimore in the second.	After wasting a two-out double by Matt Wieters in the fourth, Baltimore pulled even in the fifth. Steve Pearce hit a leadoff double and scored on a single by Markakis. Later in the inning, Sabathia retired Adam Jones on a grounder with runners at second and third.	Replays indicated first base umpire Eric Cooper got two calls wrong in the sixth inning, both of which went against Baltimore. Brett Gardner appeared to be picked off first base and was called safe, and Wieters seemed to beat out an infield hit but was called out.	Game notes	 Orioles RHP Miguel Gonzalez (blister on thumb) will return from the disabled list Tuesday night and start against the Yankees, who will have right-hander Phil Hughes on the mound. Hughes yielded seven earned runs in the first inning of his last start, against Seattle. ... Yankees 1B Mark Teixeira batted in a simulated game in Florida, testing his injured wrist for the first time since spring training. Also, 3B Kevin Youkilis (spine) took batting practice and fielded ground balls; 3B Alex Rodriguez (hip surgery) fielded grounders; INF Eduardo Nunez (oblique) did dry swinging and also took grounders; and RHP Ivan Nova threw 60 pitches in extended spring training ... Washington Capitals forward Brooks Laich threw out the ceremonial first pitch. ... Suzuki extended his hitting streak at Camden Yards to 20 games.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ATLANTA --  Even without an effective change-up, Julio Teheran still had enough to pitch into the ninth inning.	"I decided to just compete with my other pitches," he said. "I know my fastball is good, my two-seamer, so I just tried to command my curve and my slider."	Teheran pitched 8 1/3 strong innings, Dan Uggla hit a three-run homer and the Atlanta Braves won their fourth straight game with a 5-1 victory over the struggling Minnesota Twins on Monday.	Teheran (3-1) gave up five hits, one run -- Josh Willingham's homer in the ninth -- and one walk. He struck out four, throwing 80 of his 123 pitches for strikes.	Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez gave Teheran a chance to finish the game, but he and pitching coach Roger McDowell had agreed before the ninth that they wouldn't let the 22-year-old go past 125 pitches.	Teheran noticed in his pregame bullpen session that he wouldn't be able to rely too much on his change-up. He tried it against a few batters early in the game, but stuck with what was working instead of forcing the pitch on catcher Gerald Laird.	"For the experience of being out there in the ninth inning -- maybe he was a little tired -- but you've got to dig deep a little bit," Gonzalez said. "It was good for him."	Cory Gearrin earned his first career save by retiring pinch-hitter Oswaldo Arcia on a flyout that gave Minnesota its sixth straight loss.	The previous longest career outing for Teheran was seven innings, a mark he reached in a no-decision April 29 against Washington and a May 9 victory at San Francisco.	After rallying in the late innings to win three straight from the Los Angeles Dodgers over the weekend, Atlanta jumped on Twins starter Kevin Correia (4-4) early.	"He said it -- his arm was dragging tonight," Minnesota manager Ron Gardenhire said. "He just couldn't get the whip in it, couldn't get the ball where he wanted to, I think. Normally he's really good locating the baseball, and he was up."	In the first, Freddie Freeman had an RBI single, and Uggla hit his eighth homer, a three-run shot, to make it 4-0.	Juan Francisco led off the fourth with a double, moved to third on Teheran's sacrifice bunt and scored on Andrelton Simmons' sacrifice fly RBI for a 5-0 lead.	Correia had his shortest outing in nine starts this season. In four innings, he allowed eight hits, a season-high five runs and one walk.	Correia recorded no strikeouts for the first time this year and the first time as a starter since April 29, 2012, when he and the Pittsburgh Pirates lost in Atlanta.	"I didn't have real good command of pretty much anything, really," Correia said. "I was kind of getting away with it there after the first. I was able to kind of weasel my way through a couple innings, I guess."	Ryan Pressly pitched the fifth and sixth for Minnesota, allowing one walk and striking out one. Caleb Thielbar, recalled from Triple-A Rochester earlier in the day, worked the seventh and eighth, giving up a single and striking out three.	Teheran allowed a single to Justin Morneau in the first, faced the minimum in the second and gave up a leadoff single to Aaron Hicks in the third.	Morneau singled to begin the fourth and moved to second on a walk, but Teheran ended the threat with a flyout and a groundout.	Teheran, a 22-year-old in his first full season, held Minnesota to just one base runner -- Willingham, who was hit by a pitch in the sixth -- over the next four innings.	In his past five starts, the 22-year-old right-hander is 3-1 with a 2.41 ERA.	Teheran retired Morneau on a flyout to begin the ninth, but Willingham hit his sixth homer and Trevor Plouffe singled to end the pitcher's night.	Luis Avilan faced the next two batters. Parmelee singled and pinch-hitter Ryan Doumit flew out before Gearrin retired Arcia.	Teheran credited Laird with helping him stay on point.	"Everything he wanted, I tried to pitch," Teheran said. "If I did shake him, he got me to throw it where he wanted me to. I shook him like twice the whole game. I did it in the seventh inning, and he got mad at me. But I know that sometimes I get confused, and he helped me with that."	Game notes	 Minnesota made its first regular-season visit to Turner Field and its first trip to Atlanta since the 1991 World Series. ... The Braves announced during the game that LHP Eric O'Flaherty will undergo season-ending elbow ligament replacement surgery on Tuesday. The news wasn't unexpected for O'Flaherty, the eighth-inning specialist who went on the disabled list Saturday with a torn ligament. ... Atlanta RHP Tim Hudson, Tuesday's scheduled starter, is 0-2 with an 11.42 ERA in his past two starts. ... RHP Mike Pelfrey will pitch for Minnesota and is 0-1 with a 7.20 ERA in his past two starts. ... Francisco began the game hitless in his past 10 at-bats with seven consecutive strikeouts. He finished 2 for 3 with one walk and one strikeout.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

NEW YORK --  Things weren't going well for Johnny Cueto in his return from the disabled list, so he had a conversation -- with himself.	That's all it took.	Cueto responded to the pep talk by striking out six of his last seven batters, then Jay Bruce helped make him a winner by hitting a tiebreaking home run that carried the Cincinnati Reds to a 4-3 victory over the New York Mets on Monday night.	"I asked myself, `What was going on, what happened?" Cueto said through a translator. "I told myself I have to start pitching the way I am. Then after that, I said, `That is me."	Brandon Phillips had a two-run single for his first career hit off Shaun Marcum in 13 at-bats. Phillips also made two sparkling plays in the field to help the Reds bounce back from a stunning 3-2 loss to the Phillies in which closer Aroldis Chapman gave up two home runs.	Chapman, the Reds' fifth reliever, struck out two -- one on a 99 mph fastball -- in a perfect ninth for his ninth save. He had blown his two previous save chances.	"Got to get back on the horse, right away," manager Dusty Baker said. "Otherwise it festers and grows."	Cueto (2-0) started for the first time since leaving his outing April 13 in the fifth inning with a strained left upper-back muscle. Making his fourth start of the season, the Reds' ace gave up three hits and three runs with eight strikeouts in five innings. But he walked four, including one in the third, when Marlon Byrd touched him for a three-run homer.	"I knew you just couldn't keep getting in trouble like that, walking guys without centering one, but that's just what happened," Baker said. "But he came back and pitched well."	After the homer, Cueto struck out four in a row with a fastball that reached the mid-90s.	His counterpart, Marcum (0-5), rarely reached 86 mph in pitching at least six innings for the second straight start after failing to finish five in any of his first three starts with the Mets. Still, he remains winless in his first season in New York.	Slumping Mets first baseman Ike Davis slid deeper into his monthlong funk, going 0 for 3 and being called for interference in the field when he was clipped at first by Joey Votto, who was making a turn toward second base in the Reds' three-run first inning.	Davis was lifted in a double switch after striking out in the sixth, his second strikeout of the night. He has two hits in his last 36 at-bats, and only one RBI in May.	Marcum appeared headed for another early exit after a 20-minute top of the first. He walked Shin-Soo Choo leading off. After an out, Votto, the NL player of the week, hit a smash that ricocheted off first base and into right field. As he made his turn at first, Votto nudged Davis, who was nonchalantly standing near the bag, watching the play. Votto was tagged out at second but Davis was charged with an error for interference and Votto was awarded second.	"I was looking for the ball and I took a couple of steps," Davis said. "That's why I was there longer than I should've been."	Phillips followed with a two-run single and Bruce doubled in a run, extending his hitting streak to 11. Marcum struck out Todd Frazier and Xavier Paul, and walked off to mock cheers.	"We've been through this now for what, five starts? I get hit, it's location. I made four or five mistakes today and they all got hit," Marcum said. "Got to limit the mistakes."	The right-hander did not give up another hit until Paul singled with two outs in the fourth.	Bruce broke the tie with a scorching line drive into the right-field seats leading off the sixth.	"Woo, that was a missile," Baker said.	Mets manager Terry Collins took a chance on putting strikeout-prone Rick Ankiel in the second spot in the order because he was 7 for 16 against Cueto, and Ankiel led off the third with a single. David Wright walked and, after Lucas Duda struck out, Byrd sent a drive to left field for his fourth homer this year.	Byrd came in 6 for 11 against Cueto.	The Mets loaded the bases in the first on two walks and a single by Duda, bringing up Davis.	The scoreboard operator urged fans to cheer on Davis, and many of the 23,038 in attendance made some noise. Davis hit a sharp grounder toward second, but Phillips dived to his right to stop it and then threw out Davis.	"I hit one ball hard -- at the wrong guy, a Gold Glover," Davis said.	Phillips then showed why he's a three-time Gold Glove winner in the fifth, making a long run into center field for a basket catch with his back to the plate. It was a very difficult play, but he made it look easy.	"I practice that," Phillips said.	Collins and reliever LaTroy Hawkins were ejected by plate umpire Tom Hallion after the top of the seventh for disputing a call that Phillips was hit by a pitch. Collins and Hawkins insisted the ball hit the knob of the bat and not Phillips' hand.	Game notes	 The Mets signed RHP David Aardsma to a minor league contract. He requested his release from the Miami Marlins organization Wednesday. The former Seattle closer missed all of 2011 and made only one appearance late last season with the Yankees. He will report to Triple-A Las Vegas. ... The Reds sent INF Neftali Soto to Triple-A Louisville to make room for Cueto. ... The Mets will host military appreciation night on Sunday. The Mets have given out more than 3,800 tickets to military personnel and their families for the game against Atlanta.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MIAMI -- In a game between struggling starters and offenses, the Miami Marlins came out on top.	Alex Sanabia outpitched Cole Hamels, leading Miami past the Philadelphia Phillies 5-1 on Monday night.	Justin Ruggiano and Nick Green each drove in two runs before a season-low crowd of 13,231 at Marlins Park.	"We've been waiting for those base hits and tonight we were fortunate enough to get a couple of them," Marlins manager Mike Redmond said. "It was nice to see."	Sanabia (3-6), who had lost each of his past five starts, allowed one run and seven hits over 6 1/3 innings to get his first win since April 16.	"It's been a while, a few outings since I had one," Sanabia said. "It felt great to get one."	Miami had 11 hits and struck out 13 times on its way to scoring more than three runs for just the second time in 13 games. The Marlins have won two straight after dropping seven in a row and 10 of 11.	Miami improved to 4-5 against Philadelphia, including wins in the last three matchups. The Marlins are 9-27 against everyone else.	"They can handle different teams better than others," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said. "They've got a young team and they scrap and claw. They might not score a lot of runs, but they get their cuts in and against us they score. They score enough to beat us at times."	Hamels (1-7) struck out 10 in six effective innings but has not won since April 28 at the New York Mets. Domonic Brown homered for the Phillies, who have had trouble scoring as well.	"We definitely have to score more runs to have a winning team," Manuel said. "Hopefully we can keep staying at it and we will, but right now it's tough. We take a step forward and two steps back."	Sanabia and Hamels entered tied with Cubs right-hander Edwin Jackson for the NL lead in losses, but both pitched well.	Hamels, the 2008 World Series and NLCS MVP, gave up two runs and seven hits without a walk. The left-hander allowed three singles in the first inning and they resulted in a run when Marcell Ozuna drove in Adeiny Hechavarria for an early Marlins lead.	Brown homered to right in the second, his eighth of the season. But that was the only run for the Phillies.	"It's definitely frustrating because I know we have the talent and the ability," Brown said. "The numbers speak for themselves in the past. It's May, it's time to get going as a team."	Hamels, who signed a $144 million, six-year contract last July, settled down after the first and fanned seven of 10 batters during one stretch. But the Phillies dropped to 1-9 when he starts after going 21-10 last season.	Hamels did not speak to reporters after the game.	"You know it's tough on him, it's got to be," Brown said. "He probably won't say it's tough on him, but I would say it definitely is."	Hamels gave up a leadoff single to Placido Polanco in the sixth and a two-out RBI double to Ruggiano that snapped an 0-for-18 slump and put the Marlins ahead 2-1.	"I haven't been keeping track of what I've not been doing this past week. I just know it hasn't been good," Ruggiano said. "It snowballs on you. ... It was nice to come out and get that monkey off my back and get some hits and some RBIs and win games."	Chris Coghlan had two hits, including a triple, for the Marlins. He also made a diving catch in left field to take a hit away from Brown in the sixth with two runners on to end the inning.	"That's the difference between today's game and (Sunday's) game: We would get a few breaks, and today they caught balls that we hit," Manuel said. "It's hard to explain."	Philadelphia had a pair of runners on base with one out in the seventh, but Ryan Webb relieved Sanabia and retired pinch-hitter Laynce Nix and Jimmy Rollins to preserve the lead.	"We had a good chance when Nix pinch hit in the seventh, but we couldn't tie the game up," Manuel said. "That might have made all of the difference in the world."	Chase Utley was caught stealing to end the eighth.	Miami tacked on three runs in the bottom half. Ruggiano had an RBI single off Phillippe Aumont to score Polanco. Two batters later, Green blooped a two-run single to shallow center that Ben Revere couldn't come up with, making it 5-1.	Chad Qualls struck out two in a hitless ninth.	NOTES: Hamels is 2-2 with a 1.80 ERA in five starts at Marlins Park. ... Hechavarria stole the first base of his career in the first inning. ... Miami placed OF Matt Diaz on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to May 19, with a bruised left knee and selected OF Jordan Brown from Triple-A New Orleans. ... Miami rookie RHP Jose Fernandez (2-2, 3.48 ERA) will face Philadelphia for the third time on Tuesday. He has tossed 13 scoreless innings with 14 strikeouts in the first two meetings.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- Bartolo Colon celebrated his 40th birthday a few days early with something he's enjoyed quite a few times over the years: a win over the Texas Rangers.	Seth Smith homered and scored three times, Colon pitched seven strong innings for his first victory in nearly a month and the Oakland Athletics beat the Texas Rangers 9-2 on Monday night.	Colon, who turns 40 on Friday, gave up two runs on six hits and struck out three. It was the first win for Colon (4-2) since April 23 at Boston, and he joined Bert Blyleven, Dennis Leonard and Jack Morris as the pitchers with the most wins over the Rangers at 19.	"I like to pitch here," Colon, who has 175 wins in 16 seasons, said through a translator. "I don't know why."	Coco Crisp got three hits, and had the first of three straight Oakland doubles in a four-run fifth inning that broke a 1-1 tie. He scored when Yoenis Cespedes hit a line drive just over Adrian Beltre's head with the third baseman playing in, and Cespedes came home on Brandon Moss' line drive to the wall in right.	Josh Lindblom (0-1) lost in his 2013 debut and first major league start.	Lindblom was replaced by left-hander Joe Ortiz after striking out Josh Donaldson in the fourth. Smith hit an RBI single and went to second when left fielder David Murphy dropped the ball trying to make a throw home. The error allowed Smith to score on a single by Chris Young for a 5-1 Oakland lead.	"The first four innings I was able to make pitches and work myself out of jams," Lindblom said. "That fifth inning, I couldn't make the pitch."	Smith's opposite-field homer to left for a 1-0 lead in the second was the 13th straight solo homer for the A's, tying a franchise record set in 2007. Jed Lowrie had three hits, including one of five doubles for Oakland.	The two outs Smith made were with the bases loaded as the A's stranded a season-high 15. Texas pitchers walked a season-high eight, although two were intentional.	Even Colon had problems with walks -- by his standards. He matched his season total by walking Geovany Soto twice.	"Those don't happen too often," A's manager Bob Melvin said.	Top Texas prospect Jurickson Profar made his first appearance in the majors this year at second base and was immediately put to the test by Crisp, who had infield hits his first two times up despite Profar's best efforts. The 20-year-old went far to his left to grab the first one and fielded the next almost behind the bag at second, but Crisp beat the throw both times.	Profar drove in both Texas runs without a hit, scoring Soto with a grounder in the third and Mitch Moreland with a sacrifice fly in the fifth.	"The first one, we needed a groundball, he got the groundball," Rangers manager Ron Washington said. "He handled his at-bats well tonight. We scored two runs, he got both of them."	With Ian Kinsler on the disabled list because of bruised ribs, Profar is back with the Rangers after homering in his first big league at-bat as a 19-year-old last year.	"I'm feeling more comfortable in the box and on the field," said Profar, who hit .424 during an eight-game hitting streak that included the first multihomer game of his career before getting called up from Triple-A Round Rock. "It starts from there."	Colon was helped by three double plays in the first four innings, including a pair started by Moss at first base when he snagged hard grounders from Lance Berkman and Moreland, stepped on the bag and got the runners trying to go to second. He came out after throwing 95 pitches.	"I mean, he's 40 and we'd like to try to get him through a season," Melvin said. "So anything over 100 for me is starting to get a little uncomfortable for me. To give us seven, just short of 100, is terrific."	Lindblom, who came to Texas as a reliever in the offseason trade that sent franchise hits leader Michael Young to Philadelphia, gave up seven hits and four runs in 4 2/3 innings filling in for Alexi Ogando, who's on the disabled list with right biceps tendinitis.	The 25-year-old had 101 relief appearances over two seasons with the Los Angeles Dodgers and Phillies but struggled in the Texas bullpen during spring training. The Rangers decided to try him as a starter at Round Rock, where he was 4-0 with a 2.08 ERA.	"Fastball command was a little off today," Lindblom said. "I wasn't able to command my heater in and out, which has kind of been my staple all year."	Game notes	Rangers C A.J. Pierzynski (strained oblique) was the designated hitter in the final game of a two-game rehabilitation stint at Double-A Frisco on Monday. He went 1 for 3 with a single and was recalled after Monday's game to join the Rangers on Tuesday. Lindblom was sent back down to accomodate the move. ... Athletics RHP Chris Resop cleared waivers and was optioned to Triple-A Sacramento. Oakland designated him for assignment Friday.	Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

CHICAGO --  Adam Dunn has been insisting all season he feels great, even while he was piling up strikeouts at the beginning of the year.	It's not so hard to believe him right now.	Dunn hit a three-run homer in the first inning and the Chicago White Sox handed Jon Lester his first loss with a 6-4 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Monday night.	"It was hard to sit here and keep saying over and over and over how good I felt, with no results," Dunn said. "Hopefully these results keep coming and people start believing me that I wasn't lying to them."	Alejandro De Aza and Alexei Ramirez added consecutive RBI doubles in the second as Chicago took advantage of an ineffective Lester (6-1) to earn its fifth win in seven games in the opener of an eight-game homestand. The White Sox scored each of their runs with two outs.	"The first inning's good, but you know for me, that next inning when you get a couple doubles and you score like that, that's a good sign," manager Robin Ventura said.	Jarrod Saltalamacchia hit a two-run homer for the Red Sox, who had won five in a row. Saltalamacchia made a bid for a second two-run shot, but Dayan Viciedo brought in his drive on the warning track in left-center with the White Sox clinging to a 6-4 lead in the seventh.	Boston right fielder Shane Victorino was running the bases in the sixth when his left hamstring started to bother him, and he was replaced in the field in the bottom of the inning. He also missed games on Friday and Saturday with a back injury.	"He felt the left hamstring grab him, little bit of a spasm," manager John Farrell said. "Given what he's been dealing with, low back, I wasn't going to take any chances in that situation."	Farrell said Victorino was day to day, and the team would proceed cautiously.	Lester was trying to become the first left-handed starter to win his first seven decisions for Boston since Roger Moret in 1973. But he was shaky in the first couple of innings while falling to 4-5 in 10 career games against the White Sox to go along with a 5.43 ERA, his highest against any AL team.	"Chicago, for some reason, I don't feel like I've ever pitched well here for whatever reason," Lester said. "It is what it is, and it always goes back down to executing pitches at the right time, and I didn't execute the pitch in the first inning. That changed the whole momentum of the game."	Lester retired his first two batters before running into trouble. Alex Rios singled to extend his hitting streak to 15 games and Paul Konerko walked before Dunn drove a 2-0 pitch to right for his fifth homer in seven games and No. 11 on the year.	Dunn also walked before Viciedo singled home Ramirez to make it 6-2 in the fifth. The burly slugger is batting .360 with 13 RBIs in his last seven games, raising his average 39 points to .172 for the year.	"When he's right, he can do a lot of damage," Ventura said. "His pitch selection is good. I don't know mechanically exactly what it is but when a guy knows he's in the right position to hit and he's more confident, it comes down to pitch selection."	Lester retired the side in order in the sixth, and that was it for him. He allowed five earned runs and seven hits, walked three and struck out two.	While Lester struggled, Dylan Axelrod (2-3) pitched six effective innings to win his second straight start. The right-hander, who could lose his spot in the rotation when John Danks comes off the disabled list, gave up two runs and four hits.	"It's easy to have a lead and pitch to contact and just let the defense work," he said.	Axelrod acknowledged that he thinks about his role with Danks almost back from August shoulder surgery, but Ventura said there's still a bit to go before a decision has to be made.	"John's going to throw next couple of days, and then we'll find out exactly, go from there," Ventura said. "But again, it's not going to be easy for anybody. We'll make that decision when we get there."	Matt Thornton yielded Will Middlebrooks' two-run double in the seventh and Jesse Crain extended his scoreless streak to 17 innings before Addison Reed finished for his 15th save in 16 chances.	With one out and a runner on first in the ninth, Middlebrooks hit a drive that De Aza caught at the wall in center field. Konerko then made a diving stop on Stephen Drew's grounder and flipped the ball to Reed covering first to end the game.	The White Sox improved to 9-9 at home on the first night of a stretch of 17 of 23 games in Chicago that includes two against the Cubs at Wrigley Field. If the White Sox (20-23) can turn around their sluggish play at U.S. Cellular Field, it could be a chance to make up some ground in the bunched AL Central.	Game notes	 The Red Sox activated closer Andrew Bailey from the 15-day disabled list. He had been out since April 29 with right biceps inflammation. ... Chicago 2B Gordon Beckham, placed on the disabled list April 12 with a broken bone in his left wrist, played shortstop in a rehab game with Triple-A Charlotte on Monday night. Ventura said Beckham could return to the team by the end of the week. ... LHPs Felix Doubront (3-1, 6.03 ERA) of the Red Sox and Jose Quintana (2-1, 3.97) of the White Sox are slated to pitch Tuesday.	---	Jay Cohen can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/jcohenap	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

MILWAUKEE -- With speculation that Don Mattingly could be fired sometime this week, the Los Angeles Dodgers manager needed Clayton Kershaw to pitch well in the worst way.	Boy, did the star left-hander come through for Donnie Baseball.	Kershaw scattered three singles in his second complete game of the year and Matt Kemp hit his first home run since April 24, lifting the Dodgers to a 3-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers on Monday night.	"Every time I get in trouble, Kersh saves me," Mattingly joked. "One more day."	Ryan Braun managed a pair of singles and Yuniesky Betancourt also singled for the only hits off Kershaw (5-2). The lefty struck out five and walked one.	"We obviously hear the stuff that's going around," Kershaw said about the speculation. "I don't think we need any extra added motivation to play better, but we want to do well for Donnie.	"We've always wanted to play well," he said. "He's a great manager and a great person, and we know it's up to us. He can't go out there and play."	Andre Ethier homered and tripled for the last-place Dodgers before being ejected by plate umpire Dan Bellino for arguing a called third strike in the eighth inning.	"Today was a great superstar win," catcher A.J. Ellis said. "We had Clayton do his thing, and Matt and Andre hit home runs. That's kind of how this has all been designed and hopefully this is what continues from here on out."	The victory was a respite for Mattingly. He addressed speculation before the game on whether he would be fired this week, insisting he didn't feel as if he was about to be replaced.	Yovani Gallardo (3-4) gave up three runs, including two homers, in six innings. The right-hander lost his third consecutive start and the reeling Brewers have dropped 15 of 18 games.	"I thought he threw the ball well," Milwaukee manager Ron Roenicke said of Gallardo. "He had better life on his fastball today, he commanded it well. His slider was good. He made a couple of mistakes and they got him."	With the Dodgers' bullpen giving up 12 runs while Los Angeles was swept in a three-game weekend series at Atlanta, Mattingly took no chances. He sent Kershaw out for the ninth, and the ace needed only 10 pitches to retire the Brewers in order.	"Wow, that was pretty good," Mattingly said. "He was on a mission."	Dodgers general manager Ned Colletti said before the game he thought Kemp's lack of power this season was due to the slugger's offseason surgery on his left shoulder.	The star center fielder hit his second homer of the season, connecting for the first time in a span of 87 at-bats. Kemp's solo homer came in the sixth.	"I haven't been hitting the way I should be hitting," Kemp said. "I've been a little disappointed, but I'm still in the cages working, trying to figure this thing out. I believe in myself and I think by the end of the year I'll be getting the job done."	Colletti said his team, second-to-last in the majors in scoring at 3.4 runs per game, needed to hit better in the clutch. The Dodgers went 0 for 6 with runners in scoring position against the Brewers.	"It feels good but we still need to score more runs," Ethier said.	Kershaw beat the Brewers for the second time in five starts. He has given up only three earned runs in 39 2/3 innings for an 0.68 ERA in that span.	Kemp, who hit 116 homers the past four seasons, walked to lead off the second and scored easily on Ethier's triple for a 1-0 lead.	The Brewers tied it in the third. Rickie Weeks walked and later scored on a groundout to second by Norichika Aoki.	Ethier's solo homer, his fourth, put the Dodgers ahead in the fourth.	Game notes	Dodgers LHP Ted Lilly was reinstated off the 15-day DL. RHP Matt Magill was optioned to Triple-A Albuquerque. Lilly will spend a couple of days in the bullpen and is expected to start Saturday against St. Louis. ... Dodgers INF Jerry Hairston Jr. has tendinitis in his left knee.

HOUSTON --  Matt Dominguez was touted for his defensive skills when he joined the Houston Astros.	Lately, he's shown that he's pretty good on offense, too.	Dominguez hit a three-run homer and Jason Castro added a solo shot to give Houston a 6-5 win over the Kansas City Royals on Monday night.	The Astros trailed by one in the fourth inning before Dominguez launched his fourth homer of the season in left field to give Houston a 6-4 lead.	"I'm trying to figure some things out and be more consistent," said Dominguez, who is batting .239. "I've been able to get some big hits, and hopefully, the average will be there by the end of the year. But most importantly, I'll get the RBIs and get the (wins)."	Dominguez has hit all of his homers in the past nine games and his 21 RBIs are second on the team.	"This guy is growing up right before our eyes," Houston manager Bo Porter said of the 24-year-old. "He's getting more and more confidence ... I think he's gotten to the point where he understands himself, he understands what the league is trying to do to him, and now he's picking his spots and you see that he has some power."	Castro's homer came in Houston's two-run third inning before Kansas City took the lead on a three-run home run by Miguel Tejada in the fourth. It was his first homer since 2011.	Houston's Dallas Keuchel (1-1) allowed nine hits and four runs while striking out six in 6 2/3 innings for the win. He was helped by three double plays turned by his defense, which lead the majors with 60. Closer Jose Veras struck out two in a perfect ninth for his seventh save.	"Keuchel did a great job of, one, attacking the zone and being very efficient with his pitches and did a good job of pitching to both sides of the plate and using his off-speed stuff to induce ground ball double plays," Porter said.	Kansas City starter Jeremy Guthrie (5-2) allowed eight hits and a season-high six runs in five innings -- his shortest start of the season. He had gone 18 games without a loss before allowing 19 hits and 11 runs in the past two games to lose two straight.	"I never really got into a groove, and it's my own fault," Guthrie said. "Whether it was a walk or falling behind guys, I just wasn't able to put anybody away. For the most part, none of my pitches were super well-executed, and they just made me pay."	The Royals cut the lead to 6-5 when Eric Hosmer doubled and Jeff Francoeur sent him home with a double, which dropped just in front of a diving Jimmy Paredes in the eighth inning.	Francoeur, who entered the game in a 0 for 11 slump, had a season-high three hits for his first multi-hit game since April 30.	The Royals mustered a little more offense on Monday that they had in a weekend sweep by the Athletics when they managed just five runs in three games. But their losing streak stretched to four games after going 3 of 10 with runners in scoring position on Monday.	Royals catcher Salvador Perez was shaken up when he crashed hip-first into the railing near Houston's dugout chasing a foul ball in the fifth inning. He finished the inning, but was replaced by George Kottaras for the sixth inning. Manager Ned Yost said he has a bruised right hip and is listed as day to day.	Kansas City's three-run fourth inning ended a 36-inning streak where the Royals didn't score more than one run in a frame. Perez singled to start the inning before a one-out single by Francoeur set the table for Tejada's shot, which landed in the back of the Crawford Boxes in left field and gave Kansas City a 4-3 lead.	It was the first home run for the 38-year-old Tejada, who didn't play in the majors last season, since July 16, 2011.	"Right now, for me, even if I get a hit, it's great," Tejada said. "When I get an opportunity, I just want to help my team win a game. I'm excited to hit a home run, but I'm just trying to do my best to help us win."	Carlos Pena walked and Paredes singled in the fourth before the homer by Dominguez put Houston up 6-4.	Marwin Gonzalez led off Houston's third with a single and advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt. Gonzalez took third on an error by Elliot Johnson when he missed the catch on a pickoff try. A sacrifice fly by Jose Altuve gave Houston a 2-1 lead.	Castro's fourth homer of the season pushed Houston's advantage to 3-1.	Hosmer and Francoeur hit consecutive one-out singles in the second inning before Johnson's RBI single with two outs put Kansas City up 1-0.	Carter walked with one out in the second and Pena followed with a double to the corner of right field. The Astros tied it at 1-all when Carter scored on a groundout by Paredes.	Hosmer, the first baseman, made a nifty catch to end the seventh inning. He jumped high into the air and extended his glove to snag a liner by Paredes. He fell backward to the ground and glanced at his glove as if to double check that he actually made the catch.	Game notes	 The series continues on Tuesday when Houston's Bud Norris, who had his start pushed back two days after leaving his last outing because of lower back spasms, opposes Wade Davis. ... Houston OF Justin Maxwell, on the disabled list with a broken bone in his left hand, got the OK from his doctor to remove his brace on Saturday and took swings at underhand soft tosses on Monday. He said his hand is still sore but he's feeling much better. He isn't sure when he'll be ready for a rehabilitation assignment, but when he does go he'll wear a batting glove with hard plastic on the side to protect the bone he broke. ... New Astros president Reid Ryan, son of Hall of Fame pitcher Nolan Ryan, said Monday that he'd like Houston's Double-A affiliate Corpus Christi to play an exhibition game at Minute Maid Park in the future.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

DENVER --  Patrick Corbin was a maestro on the mound, making his slider move all over the place.	And after the Arizona Diamondbacks lefty finished off his virtuoso performance, he calmly sauntered over to congratulate his catcher, casually shook his hand and coolly walked off the field.	There were no big displays of emotion to celebrate Corbin's first complete game. This is simply what he expects and, lately, what Arizona expects out of him.	Corbin tossed a three-hitter and struck out a career-high 10 to lift the Diamondbacks to a 5-1 win over the Colorado Rockies on Monday night.	"That's what you're trying to do every time you go out there," Corbin said.	Starts like this have pretty much been the standard for Corbin. He entered the game with a 1.52 ERA and actually lowered it to 1.44 with this gem.	Corbin (7-0) also joined Randy Johnson as the only lefties in team history to begin the season 7-0. He also turned in his club-record ninth straight start in which he has pitched at least six innings and allowed two runs or fewer.	"He dominated today," catcher Miguel Montero said.	To think, warming up, Corbin thought he might be in for a long night, too. He was struggling in the pregame session with Montero, and couldn't seem to locate his pitches.	In the first inning, Corbin walked leadoff batter Eric Young Jr. But then Dexter Fowler lined into a double play, and from there Corbin was in complete command.	"In the first inning, if they would've hopped on me there ," Corbin said, shaking his head.	But they didn't.	Mixing an effective slider with a sneaky fastball, Corbin kept the Rockies hitters guessing all night.	He held Colorado hitless until Troy Tulowitzki's single up the middle in the fourth and didn't allow another hit until Nolan Arenado's double in the eighth. Pinch-hitter Jordan Pacheco broke up Corbin's shutout bid with a double that brought home Arenado.	"He just pitched an unbelievable game. I don't know what else to say," Arenado said. "Obviously, we needed to play better, but he pitched a really good game."	About the only drama left in the ninth was whether Corbin would finish it. The bullpen doors briefly opened in the outfield, but that was just a ruse as Corbin trotted out of the dugout. He warmed up his arm by waving it in circles, then retired the side.	Just like on the mound, Corbin was composed after finishing off the win, shaking hands with Montero.	"I didn't want to show too much emotion, I guess," Corbin explained. "It's great. Miggy did a great job again behind the plate."	While Corbin shined, Jon Garland (3-5) struggled. He went six innings, allowing five runs and a season-high 11 hits.	"Put your team down like that, it's terrible," Garland said. "I've done it my last four or five starts. I'm trying to figure it out."	Didi Gregorius had a big night, driving in runs with a double in the fourth and a single in the sixth. A.J. Pollock produced at the bottom of the lineup as he finished with three singles and scored two runs to help the NL West-leading Diamondbacks.	Paul Goldschmidt and Eric Chavez had RBI singles in the third, staking Arizona to a 3-0 lead. That was more than enough for Corbin, who has allowed a total of two runs over his past three starts.	Corbin is a completely different pitcher this season, one who's trusting his slider more and throwing a lot more strikes. Of his 97 pitches on Monday, 74 were for strikes.	His previous high for strikeouts was eight against Cincinnati in August. He surpassed that total when he struck out Carlos Gonzalez in the seventh.	"He had it all working," Arizona manager Kirk Gibson said.	Corbin also remains one of five undefeated starting pitchers in the league with a minimum of eight starts, along with Matt Moore (8-0), Clay Buchholz (6-0), Matt Harvey (5-0) and Max Scherzer (5-0).	Chavez tripled in the second and scored when the Rockies couldn't turn an inning-ending double play on Montero's grounder.	The 35-year-old Chavez is off to a torrid start, in part because Gibson refuses to overuse the infielder, given his history of back issues. Rarely will Gibson use Chavez more than two games in a row.	"You'll find if I do it [play him more] he will wear down a little bit and probably have medical problems," Gibson said. "We can't afford that."	NOTES: Rockies OF Michael Cuddyer expects to be in the lineup Friday in San Francisco when he's eligible to come off the 15-day disabled list. He's feeling better after receiving an epidural last week to relieve pain and stiffness in his neck. Cuddyer is on the DL with an inflamed cervical disk. He's headed to Arizona for two games of extended spring training, just to squeeze in some plate appearances. "Doing good, doing good," Cuddyer said in the clubhouse Monday.  Johnson started 7-0 in 2000.  The Diamondbacks will throw RHP Ian Kennedy (2-3) on Tuesday night, while the Rockies counter with RHP Jhoulys Chacin.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN DIEGO -- At age 34, Jason Marquis is pitching as smart as ever.	Marquis combined with four relievers on a four-hitter to win his fifth straight start, tying his career high, and Will Venable homered to lead the San Diego Padres to a 4-2 win against rookie Shelby Miller and the NL Central-leading St. Louis Cardinals on Monday night.	Marquis (6-2) has won five consecutive starts for the first time since 2007 with the Chicago Cubs. He allowed two runs, one earned, on three hits in six innings while striking out three and walking four.	"Obviously, I got away with more mistakes probably a few years back, but I feel like I'm making better pitches in bigger situations now," Marquis said. "I've learned to slow the game down more than anything. Years past, when you're younger and you maybe have a little extra on your fastball, you tend to speed things up -- harder, harder, harder. I try to stay away from the big inning and learn to focus on that pitch at that particular moment instead of the big picture."	San Diego's only major offseason move was to re-sign Marquis for $3 million, and it's paid off.	"He's a guy that continues to make pitches when he needs to," manager Bud Black said. "He knows how to navigate his way through a major league game. He gets on some nice rolls where he retires some hitters and makes it look easy."	Marquis got out of jams in the second and third.	The Cardinals tied it at 1 in the second when Chase Headley, San Diego's Gold Glove third baseman, booted Miller's bases-loaded grounder for an error with two outs, allowing Yadier Molina to score. Marquis got to a full count against Matt Carpenter before striking him out.	In the third, the Cardinals had runners on first and third with no outs after Carlos Beltran doubled and Matt Holliday singled. Beltran scored on Allen Craig's double-play grounder before Marquis got Molina to ground out to end the inning.	Chris Denorfia went 3 for 3 with an RBI for the Padres, who have won three straight and five of seven. Huston Street pitched the ninth for his 11th save in 12 chances.	Venable hit his seventh homer of the season, a drive into the Jack Daniel's Old No. 7 Deck atop the right-field fence leading off the seventh. It came on the second pitch from Mitchell Boggs, who just returned from a demotion to Triple-A Memphis.	The Padres chased Miller in the sixth, when they scored two runs on three walks, one hit and a hit batter. The rookie threw 107 pitches.	"It seems like 20 pitches every single inning, every single outing, back-to-back starts," Miller said. "Throwing so many pitches in back-to-back games is not good. It accumulates with a little bit of everything. My curveball wasn't really good tonight. Neither was my changeup. My fastball wasn't really there. Multiple things were off."	With the Cardinals leading 2-1, manager Mike Matheny pulled Miller after his second walk of the inning, with two outs. Denorfia greeted Fernando Salas with an RBI single. John Baker walked to load the bases and Salas hit pinch-hitter Jesus Guzman with a pitch to bring in another run.	Miller (5-3) allowed three runs and five hits in 5 2/3 innings, struck out five and walked three.	He entered with a 1.40 ERA, tied with Clayton Kershaw of the Los Angeles Dodgers for the lowest in the majors. It went up to 1.74. Two starts earlier, Miller allowed a single to start the game and then retired the next 27 batters in a 3-0 home win against Colorado.	Miller's scoreless streak of 14 2/3 innings ended in the first when Everth Cabrera hit a leadoff single and scored on Headley's one-out single.	San Diego had a prime opportunity to score in the third when Cabrera hit a leadoff triple to right-center. But he was stranded when Miller struck out Venable and Headley before Carlos Quentin popped up.	Game notes	Headley snapped a streak of 67 consecutive games without an error dating back to Aug. 21, when he misplayed a grounder in the second inning. He had 156 chances in between errors. ... Cardinals 3B David Freese was a late scratch due to getting three stitches in the base of his right thumb after getting spiked by Milwaukee's Norichika Aoki while tagging him out during a rundown Sunday. Freese was replaced by Ty Wigginton, who grew up in suburban Chula Vista. ... Marquis has a 2.27 ERA during his five-game winning streak. ... The series continues Tuesday night when St. Louis RHP Adam Wainwright (5-3, 2.51 ERA) faces RHP Edinson Volquez (3-4, 5.55).	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Ryan Vogelsong felt the best he had in months, then it all ended on one painful swing.	The right-hander broke his throwing hand chasing an inside fastball after pitching himself toward his first win in seven starts, and the San Francisco Giants returned from a terrible road trip to beat the Washington Nationals 8-0 on Monday night.	Vogelsong was injured while fouling a ball off his hand in the fifth inning. He grimaced in pain while grabbing the hand -- knowing immediately it was serious. He was quickly examined near the batter's box and left the game.	Vogelsong broke two bones along the right pinkie and dislocated a knuckle that the medical staff couldn't get popped back into place. He was scheduled for surgery Tuesday morning at Stanford and said he likely would have pins inserted to stabilize the hand and help speed the healing process.	"We're not talking about Tommy John or anything here," Vogelsong said, his eyes misty. "Basically as fast as we can get it to heal so I can start throwing again."	Nationals manager Davey Johnson announced after the game that reliever Ryan Mattheus broke his pitching hand punching a locker in frustration Sunday. The right-hander allowed five runs in one inning of Washington's 13-4 loss to the San Diego Padres, but didn't tell the team about the injury until just before Monday's game.	"Last night after the game he came in and was in the locker room and banged his glove against his locker with his hand in it," Johnson said. "His hand didn't swell up but when he went out to throw today his hand swelled up and he couldn't throw the ball."	Vogelsong (2-4) seemed back on track, snapping a six-start winless stretch with just his second victory of 2013 and first since April 11 against the Cubs at Wrigley Field.	He walked off to warm ovation as Nick Noonan pinch hit. Vogelsong allowed three hits in five scoreless innings, lowering his ERA from 8.06 to 7.19.	"It's really a shame because tonight was the Vogey that we know, the way he threw all of last year, good stuff," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "It's a tough one. I feel bad for him. I know he felt really good tonight. You've got to deal with these things. He'll be back, hopefully, in a couple months."	Brandon Belt hit a solo home run, matched his career best with four hits and scored three runs as San Francisco pounded a season-high 17 hits. Angel Pagan hit an RBI double and two-run single for San Francisco, also making a great leaping catch against the center-field wall.	Andres Torres had three hits and drove in a run and Marco Scutaro added an RBI single among his two hits.	Vogelsong got the defensive gem from Pagan when the center fielder slammed into the wall on Adam LaRoche's deep fly in the second.	The 2011 All-Star ended a six-start winless stretch in which he had lost his previous two outings and gone 0-3. He was tagged for eight runs (three earned) and six hits in two innings for his shortest outing of the year last Wednesday at Toronto.	"It was awesome," Belt said. "The special thing about this team is everybody roots for everybody. We were as happy for him as can be, and it's tough to see him go down like this. But we know he'll be back, and strong and ready to go."	Javier Lopez took over for Vogelsong in the top of the sixth and received a little bit more warm up time. Three more relievers finished for the Giants' sixth shutout. San Francisco snapped a three-game skid after a 1-5 road trip through Toronto and Colorado.	The Giants have until next Tuesday before they need a fifth starter.	Bryce Harper went 0-for-4 in his return to the Nationals' lineup after last season's NL Rookie of the Year missed two games with a bruised left knee. He was hurt in a hard collision with the outfield wall a week earlier at Dodger Stadium that also caused him to need 11 stitches on his chin.	Left-hander Zach Duke (0-1) lasted just 3 1/3 innings in a spot start for Ross Detwiler, who is sidelined with back spasms. Duke allowed four runs and seven hits in his first start of the year.	Washington was shut out for the sixth time.	Vogelsong retired the first eight Nationals hitters in order.	The right-hander lasted only 2 2/3 innings in his first career start against Washington last year, allowing eight runs on nine hits with two walks.	"That's the best I've felt in a long time, from a mental aspect, physical aspect, everything felt good," he said. "It was nice to be able to get out there and have everything I've been working on for the last couple weeks kind of fall into place. From that standpoint it's a good place to start when I come back."	Scutaro extended his hitting streak to 18 games with a third-inning single. The second baseman fielded Roger Bernadina's grounder in the fifth but dropped the ball in exchange from glove to hand, for the Giants' 15th error in their past eight games.	Game notes	Nationals OF Jayson Werth, on the 15-day disabled list with a strained right hamstring, is expected to need at least two more weeks to heal after a second MRI showed he "has some problems in there," Johnson said. "He's going to rest a bit."  A moment of silence was held for the Oklahoma tornado victims before the national anthem.  RHP Matt Cain (3-2) starts for the Giants in Tuesday night's middle game against righty Stephen Strasburg (2-5).  San Francisco's Buster Posey has hit safely in 11 of his past 12.  Belt's homer was the Giants' 21st at home. Last season through their first 23 games at AT&T Park, they had hit just six HRs.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

BALTIMORE -- The shaving cream was still glopped on Chris Dickerson's head and shoulders long after the final pitch, a tell-tale indicator that the Baltimore Orioles had finally returned to celebratory mode at Camden Yards.	Nate McLouth homered leading off the bottom of the 10th inning, Dickerson hit a pair of solo shots and the Orioles beat the New York Yankees 3-2 Tuesday night to snap a six-game losing streak.	McLouth hit a 1-1 pitch from Vidal Nuno (1-1) into the bleachers in right-center to give the Orioles their first win since May 12. Dickerson, who played sparingly for the Yankees in each of the past two seasons, connected off Phil Hughes in the third and fifth innings -- the first two-homer game of his career.	For their efforts, McLouth and Dickerson each got a shaving cream pie from teammate Adam Jones during their postgame interviews. It was a fitting way to mark the end of a skid in which all six defeats came at home.	"We really needed this win," Dickerson said. "This team continues to grind, continues to push forward even when the chips are down. Nate came up huge. This was one of those things that can turn it around."	Asked if it was the best night of his baseball career, Dickerson quickly replied, "Absolutely. Under the circumstances, yeah. ... As soon as I saw the lineup card I was already fired up, just to get the opportunity to play against them. But to go out and have that result, it was awesome."	Jim Johnson (2-4), who blew three save opportunities during the six-game skid, got three straight outs in the 10th.	"I'm just happy about the outcome of the game," Johnson said.	His performance capped an exceptional effort by Orioles pitchers, who retired 21 of the last 22 New York batters.	"It was nice to win, period," manager Buck Showalter said. "Anytime, regardless of yesterday and the day before. We don't get bogged down in that woe is me and this means that. You've got to keep turning the page."	Travis Hafner drove in both runs for the Yankees, who fell to 19-1 when scoring first. Dickerson's role in New York's defeat did not go unnoticed by manager Joe Girardi.	"We've had him up a couple times and he's done some good things for us," he said. "He helped them tonight."	Hughes allowed two runs and five hits in six innings. Coming off a horrid start against Seattle in which the right-hander yielded seven runs and got only two outs, Hughes kept the Orioles in check -- except for Dickerson.	"I thought he did OK," Girardi said. "He gave us a great chance to win the game."	Both bullpens matched zeroes until Nuno threw his third pitch.	"It was supposed to be a cutter away," the left-hander said. "It felt a little bit off and he took advantage of it. One pitch and it cost us the game. Got to forget about it and get ready to pitch tomorrow."	Baltimore starter Miguel Gonzalez gave up two runs and five hits over seven innings, striking out five and walking none. The right-hander came off the disabled list before the game following an 18-day absence with a blister on his right thumb.	"It was fun to be out there again after two weeks being out and giving a chance to my team to win a ballgame," Gonzalez said. "I think that was fun, especially getting ahead of guys. That was important."	New York got a first-inning run when Brett Gardner doubled and scored on a two-out single by Hafner. Dickerson tied it with a drive to right-center on a 3-2 pitch.	The Yankees quickly moved back in front. Vernon Wells led off the fourth with a double and Hafner followed with an RBI single.	Dickerson's second homer of the game, leading off the fifth, made it 2-all.	Gonzalez retired 11 straight batters before David Adams singled with two outs in the seventh. Lance Nix followed with a liner that right fielder Nick Markakis snagged with a dive.	Game notes	To clear a roster spot for Gonzalez, the Orioles optioned RHP Jair Jurrjens to Triple-A Norfolk. Jurrjens started one game for Baltimore, receiving a no-decision Saturday against Tampa Bay. ...RHP Hiroki Kuroda will start for New York on Wednesday night in the finale of the three-game series. The Orioles will start Jason Hammel, who is 0-2 with a 7.79 ERA in three home starts. ... Yankees manager Joe Girardi said SS Derek Jeter (left ankle) "is not really doing anything yet" and LHP Andy Pettitte (strained trapezius muscle) has not starting throwing. ... Orioles C Matt Wieters turned 27 on Tuesday.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

CLEVELAND --  Other than the first inning, Max Scherzer was flawless.	At the perfect time for the Tigers.	Scherzer retired 22 straight after giving up two hits and a run in the first and Miguel Cabrera hit a two-run homer, leading Detroit to a 5-1 win over Cleveland on Tuesday night to stop the Indians' winning streak at five and trim their lead in the AL Central.	Scherzer (6-0) gave up two singles -- one a broken-bat bloop -- in the first before shutting down baseball's hottest team for eight innings. The right-hander walked just one and struck out seven, including the final four he faced.	Scherzer's 118th and last pitch was his fastest -- a 98 mph heater to fan Drew Stubbs.	"He knew that was going to be it for him," Tigers manager Jim Leyland said. "He really cranked it up. That was pretty impressive. He did a terrific job."	Cabrera's laser shot in the sixth inning, his 12th homer and fourth in two games, off Corey Kluber (3-3) helped the Tigers win for just the second time in six games.  The defending AL champions also moved within 1½ games of the first-place Indians, who have won 18 of 23 since April 28.	"That was a dominant performance," Indians manager Terry Francona said. "His last pitch was 98, and when you're up around 115 or 120 pitches and you have that left in the tank, that's saying a lot."	Scherzer gave the Tigers a much-needed outing and set the stage for Cy Young winner Justin Verlander, who will pitch Tuesday night.	Andy Dirks hit a solo homer in the sixth and had two RBIs as Detroit won the first game of the short, showdown series.	In the first, Scherzer was touched for a leadoff single by Michael Bourn, a one-out base hit by Asdrubal Cabrera and a hard-hit sacrifice fly by Michael Brantley before he made the Indians look silly. He mixed his pitches, had Cleveland's hitters off-balance and grew stronger as the game went on.	"He had his good stuff all the way around from his fastball, a good slider and a good changeup," Bourn said. "He came out and dominated."	Scherzer, who won five straight starts before getting a no-decision in his last outing against Houston, didn't get much support but was so good he didn't need it.	He struck out seven of the last 12 batters, and felt better on his last pitch than the previous 117.	"I definitely had the adrenaline going in that situation," he said. "You know that's your last inning and you throw the ball as hard as you can."	Before the game, Francona said there's a danger in trying to pitch around Cabrera because Detroit has plenty of other dangerous hitters in its lineup.	"I guarantee you if you pitch around him all day, they're going to score," he said.	Kluber went right at Mr. Triple Crown his first two times up, and retired Cabrera on a grounder to third in the first and routine fly to center in the fourth.	But in the sixth, Cabrera, who homered three times in a loss at Texas on Sunday, did what he does best.	Dirks opened the inning with his fifth homer, a drive into the right-field seats to tie it 1-all. Torii Hunter followed with a double that one-hopped the wall in right, bringing up Cabrera with first base open.	Francona elected to have Kluber to pitch to Cabrera, who rocketed an 0-1 fastball over the center-field fence to give the Tigers a 3-1 lead.	Francona said he didn't walk Cabrera because Prince Fielder, Victor Martinez and Jhonny Peralta could have made things worse.	"Nobody out, you're asking for trouble," Francona said. "If you walk him and you have first and second with nobody out, you're putting your pitcher in a tough spot."	Leyland marveled at Cabrera's ability to hit Kluber's pitch.	"The pitch was down and away and he got extended on it," Leyland said. "There aren't many guys who can do that. That's why he is who he is."	Detroit added two runs in the ninth on RBI singles by Dirks and Fielder.	The Indians were missing first baseman Nick Swisher, who was placed on the paternity list before the game after his wife, actress JoAnna Garcia Swisher, gave birth to the couple's first child.	With Swisher out, Brantley batted cleanup for the first time this season and his sacrifice fly in the first gave the Indians a 1-0 lead.	Bourn led off with a grounder through the box off Scherzer and raced to third on Asdrubal Cabrera's broken-bat single with one out. Brantley followed with a liner to right-center that was run down by Hunter but was deep enough to score the speedy Bourn easily.	That was it for the Indians, though, as Scherzer shut them down.	Game notes	 Cabrera's 195th homer with the Tigers moved him into a tie with Kirk Gibson for 10th place on the franchise list. ... Indians closer Chris Perez has deactivated his Twitter account following two bad outings and harsh comments from some followers. ... A moment of silence was observed before the game for victims of the Oklahoma tornado. ... Leyland said OF Austin Jackson (pulled left hamstring) will likely go on a minor league rehab assignment before he comes off the disabled list. Jackson has been on the DL since May 12. ... RHP Octavio Dotel (sore elbow) is playing catch in Florida. He's been on the DL since April 20. ... The crowd cheered when it was announced the Cavaliers had won the NBA draft lottery for the second time in three years.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

PITTSBURGH -- Travis Snider took a pregame pep talk from his manager to heart. Relaxed and with a clear head, he delivered a crucial sixth-inning home run for the second time in five games.	Snider hit a pinch-hit grand slam to help the Pittsburgh Pirates spoil a strong return to the mound for Matt Garza with a 5-4 win over the Chicago Cubs on Tuesday night.	Garza allowed one hit over five shutout innings in his first outing in 10 months, but the Pirates pounced on a Chicago bullpen that is 10th in the National League in ERA by sending 11 men to the plate in the sixth.	Snider, who homered for the first time in nine months in a win over Milwaukee on Thursday, hit his first career home run with the bases loaded. It was the first Pirates pinch-hit grand slam in five years.	"Tonight was probably the most calm pinch-hit at bat I've had," Snider said. "(Manager Clint) Hurdle gave a good speech before the game just talking about situations that come up, whether it's in the sixth inning, the first inning, eighth inning, ninth inning -- the game's the game. And over-thinking those situations isn't going to make it any easier for you if you don't get a hit. So I just tried to go up there and be patient.	"I got ahead of the count and was able to sit back on a changeup."	Wandy Rodriguez (5-2) allowed three runs on six hits over six innings for the Pirates, who have won nine of 11.	Darwin Barney went 4 for 4 for the Cubs, who have lost three of four.	Snider's second homer was the first pinch-hit grand slam by a Pirates player since Jason Michaels on June 2, 2008, at St. Louis. It came off of Shawn Camp after Hector Rondon and James Russell (1-1) had combined to load the bases. Pedro Alvarez walked to drive in a run.	The Pirates did not have a hit against Garza until Clint Barmes singled to right with one out in the fifth.	Garza had been sidelined since July 21 because of a stress reaction in his right elbow and, later, a strained upper back muscle.	"He was really good," Cubs manager Dale Sveum said. "He had a really good slider. His command, for it being his first time back, was outstanding. Even when he missed, he didn't miss by much. His velocity was good, too, consistently at 93-94. He was just outstanding."	Limited by a pitch count, Garza threw 82 pitches.	"I felt great out there," Garza said. "I had some butterflies and the first couple of innings flew by. I had to kind of stop myself at one point and just slow down but it was fun. It was a long, long time and it's nice to not only come back but pitch well. You don't want to spend that much time working to get back and then pitch poorly."	Or, apparently, to hit poorly either. The lone inning in which Rodriguez allowed a runner to progress past first base was the second, when Barney had an RBI single and Garza hit a two-run double.	Cubs pitchers have 13 RBIs in May -- the most for the franchise in any month since September 1971. They also have a major league leading six doubles.	But after that, Rodriguez retired 13 of the final 15 he faced.	"At the beginning, I didn't have good stuff," Rodriguez said through a translator. "Then I started using the breaking ball and hitting spots and I was successful at that."	Justin Wilson worked around two hits in the seventh and Mark Melancon pitched a scoreless eighth.	The Cubs scored once in the ninth on a single by Starlin Castro, but Jason Grilli stuck out Anthony Rizzo swinging with two on to end the game and earn his majors-leading 18th save. Rizzo finished 0 for 5.	After sitting out Pittsburgh's previous game Sunday due to knee soreness, Andrew McCutchen went 0 for 4. He made two of the Pirates' three outs during the sixth, leaving the bases loaded to end the inning.

TORONTO --  One start ago, Fernando Rodney cost Alex Cobb a win by blowing a save against Boston.	This time, Rodney made sure Cobb went home with a W.	Kelly Johnson and Desmond Jennings homered, Cobb won for the first time in three starts and the Tampa Bay Rays beat the Toronto Blue Jays 4-3 on Tuesday night.	Cobb (5-2) allowed one run and three hits in 6 1/3 innings. The right-hander walked two and struck out two. Thirteen of his 19 outs came on groundballs.	"A lot of groundballs is always what you want to see out of him," Rays manager Joe Maddon said. "If you're seeing the ball on the ground, you know that everything is working right."	Cobb wasn't happy with his stuff, but battled enough to get his first victory since winning at Colorado on May 5.	"The changeup wasn't as sharp as I'd like it but it was good enough to get a good amount of groundballs," Cobb said. "That's what was key to my success tonight."	Jake McGee got two outs in the seventh before the Blue Jays rallied against Joel Peralta in the eighth. Munenori Kawasaki singled, Melky Cabrera walked and Jose Bautista hit an RBI single. Edwin Encarnacion struck out before Adam Lind reach on a fielding error by second baseman Ryan Roberts.	Roberts redeemed himself when Rodney came on and got J.P. Arencibia to ground into an inning-ending double play on the first pitch, with Roberts and shortstop Yunel Escobar combining.	"I really think Escobar's game was outstanding," Maddon said. "That was a big part of our win."	Arencibia hit a ninth-inning two-run homer off Rodney in Toronto's 8-7 comeback win on May 6, leaving the Rays closer in search of revenge.	"I make the same pitch, maybe more location tonight, get a groundball," Rodney said.	Roberts had entered the game in the seventh after outfielder Matt Joyce left with tightness in his right hamstring. Ben Zobrist moved from second to right.	"I don't anticipate anything bad with that but we had to get (Joyce) out," said Maddon, adding that Joyce was due to get the day off against left-hander Mark Buehrle in Wednesday's series finale.	Rodney gave up a run in the ninth but closed it out for his ninth save in 12 chances. Colby Rasmus hit a one-out double, went to third when pinch-hitter Maicer Izturis grounded out and scored on a wild pitch.	Kawasaki walked but Cabrera was caught looking for the final out.	Blue Jays right-hander Ramon Ortiz (1-2) lasted just 2 1/3 innings, allowing four runs and six hits, including two solo homers. He walked one and struck out one.	"He didn't have it tonight," Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. "His command was off and that's something he needs."	Evan Longoria doubled to begin the second, extending his hitting streak to 15 games. Longoria advanced on James Loney's grounder, then scored on Luke Scott's groundout. Johnson followed with a drive to center, his eighth.	Jennings made it 3-0 by homering on Ortiz's first pitch of the third. Joyce singled but was forced at second on Zobrist's grounder before Longoria chased Ortiz with a single. Aaron Loup came on and got Loney to ground into a fielder's choice, with Zobrist thrown out at the plate, but Scott followed with an RBI single.	Rasmus got the Blue Jays on the board with a two-out homer in the fifth, his seventh, a deep drive off the facing of the third deck.	A single and a walk gave the Blue Jays a chance to tie it with two outs in the sixth, but Escobar ranged behind second base to snare Lind's grounder and throw him out.	"I thought for sure it was a base hit," Cobb said. "It was up the middle. Escobar made an unreal play and finished it off with a great throw."	Cobb left after Brett Lawrie reached on Longoria's throwing error in the seventh. McGee came on and got Rasmus to foul out, then fanned pinch hitter Mark DeRosa.	Game notes	 Tampa Bay has won five of six on the road. ... The Blue Jays turned four double plays. ... Rays C Jose Molina (left hamstring) missed his third straight game. ... Blue Jays RHP Josh Johnson (sore triceps) allowed one run in three innings in his first rehab start at Class-A Dunedin on Monday. Johnson will start again for Dunedin on Saturday, and is expected to make a third rehab start before being activated. ... A moment of silence was held before the game to honor the victims of Monday's deadly tornadoes in Oklahoma.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ATLANTA --  Evan Gattis just keeps coming through for the Atlanta Braves.	The rookie hit a two-out, pinch-hit homer in the ninth to send the game to extra innings and Freddie Freeman won it in the 10th, sending the Braves to their fifth straight win, 5-4 over the slumping Minnesota Twins on Tuesday night.	Freeman blooped a two-out single off Brian Duensing (0-1) to bring home Jason Heyward, handing the Twins their seventh straight loss.	But Gattis was the talk of the clubhouse after his third pinch-hit homer of the season -- and second in four days.	"I'm kind of getting used to it," he said with a shrug.	His teammates were left shaking their heads.	"It's awesome to see," said Braves starter Tim Hudson, who worked five solid innings despite a lengthy rain delay. "People around the league are scratching their heads, trying to figure out how to make sure he doesn't put the ball in the seats."	Gattis, who surprisingly made the team as a non-roster player, has been a key contributor all season. He was NL rookie of the month in April, getting plenty of starts while the Braves battled a string of injuries. Now, with all the regulars healthy, he's showing what he can do off the bench. It was his ninth homer of the season, four of which have been tying or go-ahead shots in the eighth inning or later.	"I don't know how to explain it," Freeman said. "It's incomprehensible."	Duensing got the first two hitters in the 10th, but Heyward doubled off the wall in left-center. Justin Upton was intentionally walked before Freeman came through on a 3-2 pitch for his second RBI of the game.	"It wasn't the prettiest swing," Freeman said, "but it got the job done."	Gattis was looking for a pinch over the inside part of the plate.	He got just what he was looking for on an 0-1 slider from Twins closer Glen Perkins, sending a drive deep into the left-field seats.	"I was trying to hit the ball hard," Gattis said. "I don't try to hit home runs. It just happened."	Trevor Plouffe and Ryan Doumit had RBI singles in the eighth against the depleted Atlanta bullpen, giving the Twins a 4-3 lead. They were one out away from snapping their slide, but Perkins couldn't finish the job.	"I think he guessed right," Perkins said. "You've got to make good pitches. That guy, he's up there to do one thing, and he did it."	Craig Kimbrel (1-1) worked a scoreless 10th for the win.	Brian McCann homered and drove in two runs for the Braves, while Hudson pitched around a 1-hour, 26-minute rain delay -- but they were afterthoughts in light of the dramatic comeback.	The Braves bullpen, which lost two key relievers to season-ending surgeries in the past week, surrendered the lead in the eighth. Luis Avilan retired only one batter, giving up a hit and a walk.	Plouffe tied the game at 3 with a slow roller off Cory Gearrin that got through the hole between first and second. Doumit followed with another hit to right, this one much sharper, to put the Twins ahead.	"We made a nice comeback to get back in the game," Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said. "Our bullpen did just a super job of shutting everything down."	Until the end, that is.	"A tough one," Gardenhire conceded.	Hudson gave up five hits and two runs while striking out five. He bounced back from two rough starts, having allowed 11 runs in 8 2/3 innings in losses at San Francisco and Arizona.	Anthony Swarzak pitched four solid innings in relief of Minnesota starter Mike Pelphrey, who gave up two runs in the first and was lifted after a fierce storm suddenly popped up with the Twins batting in the third. The umpires wasted no time calling for the ground crew, which struggled to get the tarp over the infield amid blinding rain and whipping winds.	Then, as the storm began to break almost as quickly as it appeared, a power surge knocked out the lights and video board at Turner Field. The board came back on in a matter of seconds, but the lights took much longer to fire back up.	Hudson was ready to go.	"That was at least Double-A lighting," he quipped. "The kids in the bushes do it. Why can't we?"	With the field fully lit, Hudson quickly gave up an RBI single to Justin Morneau, tying the game at 2.	Leading off the fourth, McCann lined a pitch off Swarzak into the right-field seats that put the Braves back on top. Anthony Varvaro threw two scoreless innings for the Braves, but a bullpen that will have to do without Jonny Venters and Eric O'Flaherty the rest of the season couldn't hold the lead.	Turns out, that just set things up for another turn at hero by Gattis.	"When I saw him going up there to hit," said Freeman, who also had an RBI double in the first, "I had a feeling we were going to be playing a little longer."	Game notes	 The Twins will start RHP Samuel Deduno against the Tigers on Friday. He will take the spot previously held by LHP Pedro Hernandez, who was demoted to the minors on Monday. "He can wing it," Gardenhire said of Deduno. "You're going to get a guy who's going to put fear in people's hearts." Deduno starred for the Dominican Republic in the World Baseball Classic before sustaining a groin injury pitching in the final. He spent six weeks recovering before joining Minnesota's Triple-A team at Rochester. ... Braves RHP Jordan Walden (shoulder inflammation) played long toss before the game but isn't likely to be activated Monday, when he is eligible to come off the disabled list. Manager Fredi Gonzalez believes Walden will need a couple of minor-league starts before he returns to Atlanta.	---	Follow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

NEW YORK --  Any time a starting pitcher steps into the batter's box before he stands on the mound, he's in pretty good shape. Mike Leake enjoyed that luxury Tuesday night.	Leake pitched three-hit ball for seven sharp innings and the Cincinnati Reds parlayed star third baseman David Wright's early error into a 4-0 victory over the New York Mets.	Leake, one of the majors' best-hitting pitchers, struck out to end the top of the first inning. The Reds already led 3-0 by then, scoring all those runs after Wright let a bases-loaded, two-out grounder skip through his legs.	"It always helps a little bit," Leake said. "It helps you relax a little bit. It lets you attack hitters, instead of being timid."	Devin Mesoraco homered as the Reds won for the ninth time in 11 games. And for the second straight day, they opened a 3-0 lead over the Mets in the opening inning.	Leake (4-2) struck out four, walked two and became the latest pitcher to shut down the Mets at Citi Field. New York has lost 10 of 12 at home, rarely scoring many runs.	Leake escaped his biggest jam by retiring slumping Ike Davis on a grounder with runners on second and third to end the fourth.	"Everything was seeming to work," Leake said.	The 25-year-old righty has never pitched a shutout in the majors, and was pulled for reliever Sam LeCure to begin the eighth.	LeCure and Logan Ondrusek each threw a hitless inning to finish up.	Jonathon Niese (3-5) wasn't charged with an earned run, but he hurt himself with continuing control troubles. He walked three, all on full counts in the first inning.	Niese set down the first two batters of the night before Joey Votto walked, Brandon Phillips looped a single and Jay Bruce walked.	Todd Frazier followed with a hard grounder right at Wright, and the ball bounced under his glove and let two runs score. Earlier this season, Wright ran his errorless streak to 77 games, a team record for third basemen.	"That ball was scorched," Reds manager Dusty Baker said. "I know they called it an error, but whatever happened to the old 'too hot to handle?'"	Either way, the Reds were on their way.	"It was hit sharply and just got a tricky in-between hop," Wright said. "I looked at the replay and trying to learn what I could have done differently and really couldn't do much."	"Just wish the ball would have found the glove because Jon Niese settled in and was fantastic those next five innings and really did a nice job saving the bullpen. So I wish I could have made that one," he said. "When things aren't going so great, one play like that can cost you a game and it did today."	Donald Lutz then beat out an infield hit that reloaded the bases and Mesoraco drew another walk that forced home a run. Niese struck out Leake to end an inning in which he threw 48 pitches, and walked off the mound holding the glove in his throwing hand.	"That's what you want to do -- jump `em early," Baker said. "Break the spirit of the opposing pitcher. A lot times, they think they're throwing good in the bullpen and then, `What happened?"	Mesoraco hit reliever Collin McHugh's first pitch in the ninth for his second home run.	Votto extended his hitting streak to 10 games while Bruce's string ended at 11.	Game notes	 Reds SS Zack Cozart returned to the lineup after missing two games because of a stomach illness. ... Reds CF Shin-Soo Choo got a day off. ... Mets ace RHP Matt Harvey (5-0, 1.55 ERA) starts Wednesday afternoon vs. RHP Mat Latos (4-0, 2.91). ... The win made the Reds 146-145 all-time when visiting the Mets, including games at the Polo Grounds, Shea Stadium and Citi Field. ... Niese struck out seven. He has walked 27 and fanned 31 this season. ... The Mets have scored three runs or less in nine straight home games. ... The Reds improved to 12-12 on the road this year.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MIAMI --  Just as the Philadelphia Phillies welcomed back Ryan Howard from injury, the team may have lost Chase Utley.	Delmon Young homered and Howard added three hits and three RBIs to help carry the Phillies to a 7-3 win over the Miami Marlins on Tuesday night.	Utley was a late scratch with a rib injury suffered during batting practice. Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said the second baseman would be evaluated on Wednesday.	"When he took a swing, he kind of felt a burn, a pain, in his rib cage," Manuel said.	Also before the game, Philadelphia placed catcher Carlos Ruiz (strained hamstring) on the 15-day disabled list.	Young, meanwhile, had two hits to raise his average to .214 after returning from offseason ankle surgery. Howard returned to the lineup after missing the previous two games with a sore left knee.	"We haven't been scoring many runs and I haven't been contributing like I'm capable of," Young said. "Hopefully we can carry this over to tomorrow and the rest of this road trip because we're going to need to score runs the rest of this road trip to win ballgames."	Manuel said he glad to see Young "click" and homer for the second time this season.	"We think Delmon can hit," Manuel said. "He's 27-years-old, we definitely think he has a lot of baseball left in him. It's just a matter of him getting some at-bats and getting going."	Howard said he felt good two days after getting a cortisone shot on his left knee.	"It felt better. I'll just continue to try and build on it," Howard said. "I saw the ball pretty well and was able to get a couple of knocks off two lefties. Really, I was just focused on putting together good at-bats."	Tyler Cloyd (1-0) allowed two runs and eight hits in seven innings. He was recalled from Triple-A Lehigh Valley (International League) earlier in the day.	"Up here, I'm definitely keeping the ball down more than I did at Triple-A," Cloyd said. "I think I try to do too much down there and get out of my game at certain times."	Miami's Jose Fernandez went five innings, allowing one run and five hits. He walked one and struck out two.	"Every time I can go out there and give the team a chance to win and a chance to stay in the ball game, I'm happy," Fernandez said.	Philadelphia went ahead 2-1 in the sixth when Domonic Brown's ground out scored Howard from third. Howard led off with a single and took third on Young's double to deep center off Duane Below (0-1).	Howard's single with the bases loaded scored two runs and highlighted a four-run seventh that gave the Phillies a 6-1 lead. He received a cortisone shot Sunday.	Young's ground out and Brown's double scored the other Phillies runs in the seventh. Young homered to left-center on a 2-2 pitch with one out in the fourth. It was his second home run of the season.	Juan Pierre's seventh-inning RBI single pulled Miami within 6-2.	Howard added an RBI single in the eighth off Wade LeBlanc.	Miami's Justin Ruggiano had a run-scoring double with two outs in the ninth.	Pinch-hitter Jordan Brown's sacrifice fly in the fifth scored Placido Polanco to tie it at 1 and take Fernandez off the hook.	Game notes	 The crowd of 13,996 was the third-smallest at Marlins Park this season. ... Marlins RHP Kevin Slowey (1-4, 3.44) opposes LHP Cliff Lee (4-2, 2.83) in the series finale on Wednesday night. ... Marlins manager Mike Redmond said injured RHP Nathan Eovaldi (shoulder) was scheduled to throw a bullpen session on Wednesday before 60-65 pitches in a start with Class A Jupiter (Florida State League) on Saturday. ... Miami's Chris Coghlan tripled for the second straight game after going 121 games without one.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- Oakland rookie right-hander Dan Straily was well aware of the ace pitcher and the powerful lineup he was facing.	Now everyone can take notice of Straily, who on television before his latest start saw plenty of highlights touting Yu Darvish being on the mound.	Straily allowed only two two singles while facing 22 batters -- just one over the minimum for his seven scoreless innings -- and Yoenis Cespedes homered as the Athletics won their fifth straight game, 1-0 over the AL West-leading Texas Rangers and Darvish.	"My confidence was sky high to start the game," Straily said. "The last few times out, I walked people, hit people, hurt myself. I wasn't getting hit hard. I was hurting myself. The whole goal today was go out and fill up the strike zone."	Darvish (7-2) struck out five, but walked three and hit a batter while giving up five hits in six innings. With the help of a couple of defensive plays, the only run he allowed came when Cespedes homered to straightaway center in the third.	Cespedes' ninth homer went just beyond the reach of Craig Gentry's outstretched glove. Darvish had turned and watched after the slugger took a big swing and connected.	"As soon as Cespedes hit that home run, I knew just keep it there, 1-0 our best chance," Straily said.	"The best pitching performance we've seen out of him to date, in this ballpark, against a guy that's probably not going to give up too many runs," manager Bob Melvin said. "I think he just gained confidence as the game went along. Early in the game, he's throwing strikes, he's getting outs, they're not hitting any balls hard really, and you just kind of grow from that."	Darvish had won all five of his previous starts this season when pitching after a Texas loss. The ace from Japan had his last seven regular-season starts at Rangers Ballpark, going back to last season, and had entered the game getting a league-high 9.1 runs per nine innings pitched.	"I've been really pampered with all the run support I've been getting. You're going to have games like this," Darvish said through his translator.	Even with consecutive wins to start the three-game series, Oakland still trails the Rangers by 4 1/2 games in the AL West. The Athletics go for a sweep on Wednesday.	Grant Balfour pitched a perfect ninth for his ninth save in as many chances this season, and his 27th in a row since April 2012, to close out Oakland's third shutout of the season. Sean Doolittle pitched a scoreless eighth for the A's.	Texas was held scoreless for the third time this season.	It was only the 13th 1-0 game ever at Rangers Ballpark, which opened in 1994.	A.J. Pierzynski, the Rangers catcher activated from the disabled list earlier Tuesday, had a one-out single in the third. Jurickson Profar had a single in the sixth, but the rookie was caught stealing when he took off toward second base before Straily threw his pitch.	"I think this can be a jumping off point for him," Doolittle said of Straily. "That was pretty impressive."	After winning his season debut April 5 with 11 strikeouts at Houston, Straily was optioned to Triple-A the next day when Bartolo Colon was reinstated from the suspended list. Straily returned in late April, and was 0-2 with an 8.84 ERA in four starts since until dominating Texas.	"I've never lacked confidence, but this is definitely the most confident I've felt out there," Straily said.	Darvish, who raised his majors-best strikeout total to 91 in 66 2/3 innings, came out after 101 pitches. He had averaged 121 pitches his last three starts, including a career-high 130 five nights earlier against Detroit in a 10-4 victory.	"I was as usual, nothing affected from the last outing," Darvish said. "I really begged Wash. I wanted to keep pitching."	Game notes	Rangers reliever Neal Cotts got three outs on six pitches in his first major league appearance since May 25, 2009. Texas purchased his contract from Triple-A Round Rock earlier Tuesday. The 33-year-old left-hander had ligament replacement surgery in 2009. ... Oakland DH Jed Lowrie left the game with a bruise after fouling a pitch off his right foot. ... 1B Daric Barton, designated for assignment Saturday when A's outfielder Chris Young came off the disabled list, cleared waivers and was outrighted to Triple-A Sacramento. ... Right-hander Chris Resop also cleared waivers and was outrighted to Sacramento.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CHICAGO --  Jose Quintana looked up in the fifth inning and started thinking about the possibility.	He made a strong bid for a no-hitter. It ended with a weak hit.	Quintana did not allow a hit until before David Ortiz broke it up with one out in the seventh on a broken-bat single, and the Chicago White Sox beat the Boston Red Sox 3-1 on Tuesday night.	"In the fifth inning, I realized, man, they haven't got a hit yet," Quintana said through an interpreter. "All I wanted to do was just get outs and keep the team ahead."	Jeff Keppinger hit a two-run homer off Felix Doubront (3-2) in the fifth. Alex Rios extended his career-high hitting streak to 16 with a single and RBI double, and the White Sox won for the sixth time in eight games. They'll try to complete the sweep against Clay Buchholz on Wednesday.	Quintana (3-1) was simply terrific.	The left-hander struck out five and walked two, and he had the fans thinking they just might be witnessing something special. The roars from the stands grew louder with each out as the game wore on, right until Ortiz's bat shattered on a bloop single to center with one out in the seventh.	That ended the bid for the 19th no-hitter in White Sox history and the first since Philip Humber's perfect game at Seattle on April 21 last season.	Two more singles by Mike Napoli and Daniel Nava loaded the bases and ended the night for Quintana, who got a standing ovation as he left the field.	"He was pounding the strike zone and pretty much making his pitches," Ortiz said.	Jesse Crain came on to strike out Will Middlebrooks and Stephen Drew to end that threat, but the Red Sox got a run in the eighth after Matt Thornton walked Jarrod Saltalamacchia leading off and gave up a single to Jacoby Ellsbury. Matt Lindstrom retired pinch-hitter Mike Carp on a fly to left before uncorking a wild pitch, and Saltalamacchia scored from third when shortstop Alexei Ramirez allowed Dustin Pedroia's hard grounder to go through his legs for an error.	Ortiz then grounded into a double play to end the rally, and Rios added an RBI double with two out in the bottom half to make it a two-run game.	Addison Reed worked the ninth for his 16th save in 17 chances, although Casper Wells had a bit of an adventure in left. He slipped while catching Nava's fly to warning track for the second out before Middlebrooks ended it with a fly to center, preserving the win for Quintana.	"Everything was working," he said. "All (my) pitches were in the zone."	Doubront was a tough-luck loser even though he was almost as effective as Quintana. He allowed two runs and five hits in six innings and walked two after issuing six in his previous start against Tampa Bay, and he wasn't even too upset about the pitch Keppinger knocked to the seats.	"Not even one mistake, just I threw a good pitch," he said. "A good hitter put a good swing on it and hit it out of the ballpark."	He gave up a single to Ramirez on a slow roller toward third with one out in the first and did not allow another hit until the fifth.	Then, after getting all their runs with two out in Monday's 6-4 win, the White Sox did it again.	They got their first two when Dayan Viciedo singled to left in the fifth and Keppinger drove the next pitch to the seats in left to make it 2-0. The home run was his first since Sept. 29 when he hit one for Tampa Bay in a game at U.S. Cellular Field, and Tyler Flowers nearly  added to it when he doubled off the wall in left-center before Tyler Greene grounded out to end the inning.	"Our starting pitching's really good," Keppinger said. "Every game, we're in it. We have a chance. It's just a matter of if we can get that big hit -- or get that big two-out hit. It seems as of late, we've been getting a lot of two-out hits that are turning into runs."	Game notes	 The White Sox scratched Chris Sale from Wednesday's start against the Boston Red Sox because of a mild tendinitis in his left shoulder. Sale was scheduled to pitch against the unbeaten Buchholz (6-0, 1.78 ERA). Hector Santiago will start in his place. Sale said he "absolutely" expects to be ready for his next scheduled start against the Cubs on Tuesday.  ... Chicago's John Danks said he hopes to make his first start of the season this week. He has not pitched since May 19 last year and had surgery in August to repair a capsule tear and remove debris in his rotator cuff and biceps. ... The White Sox confirmed a report that chairman Jerry Reinsdorf has recommended a family succession plan that includes selling its interest in the franchise. The team said in a statement released Tuesday that while he has recommended putting the club up for sale "once he is no longer with us," all plans are "fluid" and "ultimately will depend on timing and other circumstances." The White Sox also said he has no plans to sell the team anytime soon. ... The Red Sox held Shane Victorino out of the lineup Tuesday against the Chicago White Sox because of tightness in his left hamstring.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

MILWAUKEE --  The Milwaukee Brewers roughed their old teammate, Zack Greinke, handing the right-hander his first loss at Miller Park.	Carlos Gomez hit a go-ahead two-run double, Jonathan Lucroy tied a career high with three hits and five Milwaukee relievers combined for five scoreless innings as the Brewers beat Greinke and the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-2 Tuesday night.	Mike Fiers (1-2), Michael Gonzalez, John Axford, Brandon Kintzler and Jim Henderson pitched Milwaukee to only its fourth victory in its last 19 games by allowing four singles. Henderson threw the ninth for his ninth save, striking out pinch-hitter Scott Van Slyke with runners on first and second.	"When the bullpen comes together like that and shuts those guys out for the rest of the game, even though their record isn't that great, that's a good hitting team," said Fiers, who got out of a bases-loaded jam with one out in the fourth. "We definitely did a great job coming out of the pen."	Greinke (2-1), making his second start since returning from a broken left collarbone, gave up season highs of nine hits, five earned runs and three walks in four-plus innings against his former team. The right-hander, traded by the Brewers to the Los Angeles Angels last July 27 before signing with the Dodgers in the offseason, had won his first 15 decisions in Milwaukee.	"I didn't think about it at all," Greinke said. "Everything was bad, not just command. Just no feel out there, no adjustments to be made. Started out bad. I got out of some jams early but never really got better."	Greinke gave up four runs in the fourth by allowing hits to the first five batters. Jean Segura led off with a triple over the head of right fielder Andre Ethier and came home to tie the score at 2-2 on a single by Ryan Braun.	Singles by Aramis Ramirez and Lucroy loaded the bases for Gomez, who gave Milwaukee a 4-2 lead with a ground-rule double over the left field wall.	"Zack's a great teammate," Gomez said. "I faced him when he was in Kansas City and he really had my number. So we had that conversation (when Milwaukee was in Los Angeles at the end of April) and I said, `I want to face you, now.' And he said, `all right, but I'm going to do the same. I'm going to strike you out.' He probably laughed at my first at-bat (a strikeout). But I continued to look for good pitches to hit. He threw me one and I hit a double."	Matt Guerrier replaced Greinke and gave up a run-scoring grounder to Yuniesky Betancourt that increased the lead to 5-2. Milwaukee's rally ended when Gomez was picked off third by Guerrier before Jeff Bianchi was caught stealing second.	Brewers' starter Hiram Burgos lasted only 3 1/3 innings, as the rookie right-hander gave up two earned runs, six hits, four walks and struck out three.	"It sure would be nice to get into the seventh inning with some of our starters," said Milwaukee manager Ron Roenicke. "Our pitch count is going up way too fast. He got himself into trouble but made some pitches to get out of it."	Lucroy's two-out single in the first gave Milwaukee a 1-0 lead.	Los Angeles went ahead in the fourth on run-scoring singles by Greinke and Nick Punto.	However, the Dodgers left 14 runners on base, including nine in the first five innings, to lose for the seventh time in their last eight road games.	"That's really kind of been the story as far as our offense has been concerned," Los Angeles manager Don Mattingly said. "We had the right people up in the right spots. We had our chances. We just weren't able to do it."	Game notes	 All 10 of the Dodgers' hits were singles. . Milwaukee won for just the second time in its last nine home games. ... Greinke was 25-9 in 1 1/2 seasons with the Brewers. ... The Dodgers were trying to win consecutive road games for just the third time this season. ... Home plate umpire Wally Bell warned both benches when Ronald Belisario threw behind Lucroy's back in the seventh. In the top of the inning, Ethier was hit in the elbow on a pitch from Axford. ... Matt Kemp, from Midwest City, Okla., will donate $1,000 to the Oklahoma tornado relief fund for every homer he hits through the All-Star break.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

HOUSTON --  Mike Moustakas was a bit daunted when he came to the plate in the eighth inning with the bases loaded and his team down by one. The numbers were looming right there on the scoreboard: 0 for 18 and a batting average under .180	Then the 24-year-old heard his Kansas City Royals teammates shouting words of encouragement, and he calmed down and smacked an RBI single to right field to tie the game.	George Kottaras followed with a bases-loaded walk to drive in the go-ahead run in a four-run eighth inning, and the Royals rallied for a 7-3 win over the Houston Astros on Tuesday night to end a four-game skid.	"One hit is not going to ... completely turn anything around, but it's a big hit in a big situation and it gives me a lot of confidence going into tomorrow," he said. "Everybody had confidence in me."	The Royals trailed 3-0 and couldn't get much going offensively until the seventh when they cut the lead to one on RBI singles by Alcides Escobar and David Lough.	Eric Hosmer chased Wesley Wright in the eighth when he singled to load the bases. He was replaced by Jose Cisnero, who gave up the one-out RBI single by Moustakas. Cisnero then walked Kottaras on four pitches to put the Royals on top.	"I just think we had some great at-bats. I was really happy for (Moustakas) to get the big base hit to tie the ballgame because he's been struggling a little bit," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "Those are little things that can get you going."	They added two more runs when Escobar grounded into a force out to score Hosmer before an error by Marwin Gonzalez allowed Moustakas to go home.	Houston's Jimmy Paredes tied a career high with three hits, including a three-run homer in the fourth inning.	Paul Clemens (1-2) took the loss after allowing three hits and two runs while getting only one out before Wright replaced him. Bruce Chen (3-0) pitched a scoreless seventh for the win.	The Royals added a run in the ninth when Elliot Johnson scored on a wild pitch by Cisnero.	Astros' starter Bud Norris allowed five hits -- all singles -- in six inning scoreless innings. He came out for the seventh inning, but was removed before facing a batter with tightness in his back.	"He threw the ball well," Yost said. "It showed you how well he threw the ball; as soon as he got out of there we started our offensive outburst."	It was the second straight game Norris had left early because of back problems. He had his start pushed back two days as a precaution after he left his previous outing with lower back spasms.	"We knew going into the game he had the issue the last game, because of that, we were only going to push him so far," manager Bo Porter said. "After that long inning, it kind of tightened up on him, and he went down and got stretched out. I think we made the right decision getting him out of the game.	The Royals didn't get a runner past second base until the seventh inning. Norris was replaced by Travis Blackley who allowed back-to-back singles by Hosmer and Lorenzo Cain. Moustakas grounded into a force out which left runners at first and third base.	Paul Clemens took over with two outs, and Escobar greeted him with a pinch-hit, run-scoring single to cut the lead to 3-1.	A sharply hit single by Lough, which Escobar had to leap to avoid, skidded into right field and sent another run home to make it 3-2.	Kansas City starter Wade Davis yielded eight hits and three runs in five-plus innings.	J.D. Martinez hit a one-out single in the fourth inning before Carlos Pena's two-out single. Paredes then launched his first homer of the season into the seats in right field to give Houston a 3-0 lead. Matt Dominguez singled and Gonzalez drew a walk, but Davis escaped the inning when Robbie Grossman grounded out.	The Royals were foiled by their baserunning in two straight innings. Johnson singled with two outs in the third inning, but was thrown out trying to stretch the hit into a double. In the next inning, Alex Gordon led off with a single, but was later caught stealing.	Paredes walked to start Houston's sixth before a single by Dominguez chased Davis. He was replaced by J.C. Gutierrez and Kottaras, the catcher, picked off Paredes when he strayed too far from second base. Gutierrez allowed a single with two outs to Grossman, but worked out of the jam when he retired Jose Altuve.	Game notes	 All of Kansas City's 13 hits were singles. ... The series wraps up on Wednesday when Kansas City's James Shields opposes Jordan Lyles. ... Houston Texans' first-round draft pick receiver DeAndre Hopkins threw out the ceremonial first pitch on Tuesday night. ... Royals C Salvador Perez was out of the lineup a night after bruising his right hip crashing into railing chasing a foul ball. An MRI revealed no damage and he hopes to play on Wednesday. ... Former Astros star Larry Dierker was named special assistant to the president on Tuesday. Dierker, who made his debut for the Astros in 1964, will work as an ambassador for the team, handling speaking engagements and other fan events. ... The Astros, whose Triple-A affiliate is in Oklahoma City, announced plans to raise money through their foundation to help victims of Monday's devastating tornado in Oklahoma. They will hold a silent auction of game-worn jerseys and sell grab bags containing autographed baseballs. All of the proceeds will go to the American Red Cross relief efforts. "We have close ties to that community and many friends there," Houston president Reid Ryan said. "Those are the folks that support us in Oklahoma City, so we're eager to do our part to help them out in a time of need."	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DENVER -- Reliever Matt Reynolds tried to outthink his former teammate, guess what pitch Wilin Rosario would be looking for and throw the opposite.	Only, Rosario knew Reynolds was trying to get inside his head, so the Colorado Rockies catcher simply shut off his mind and let his bat do the work.	Rosario drove in Carlos Gonzalez with a one-out single in the 10th inning to lift Colorado past the Arizona Diamondbacks 5-4 on Tuesday night after the Rockies squandered a late four-run lead.	"When you know somebody, that's when you get too comfortable and they can get you," Rosario explained. "I just didn't think."	And Reynolds (0-2) thought too much, before settling on a slider.	"That's kind of the Catch-22," said Reynolds, who was with the Rockies for three seasons before being traded to Arizona last November.	"If you throw him a first-pitch fastball, he can hammer it. He's a good fastball hitter, so you take your chances with an offspeed pitch, trying to get ahead of him. Probably, again, caught too much plate with it."	Reynolds gave Gonzalez a juicy pitch, too, which he hit for a double. He intentionally walked Troy Tulowitzki to get to Rosario, who came through with a liner to right on the first pitch.	Rosario lifted his hands in the air after touching first base and was soon mobbed by teammates. Pardon his enthusiasm -- it was the first game-ending hit of his career.	Felt good, too -- sore hand and all.	Earlier in the game, Rosario was hit on the right hand by a pitch that got away from Ian Kennedy. Sure, it hurt. But not enough to come out of the game.	"I still can play," he said, smiling.	The Rockies brought closer Rafael Betancourt to start the 10th, but he was in some discomfort after throwing a second straight pitch into the dirt. After a few warm-up tosses, Betancourt left with a tight right groin. He will undergo an MRI on Wednesday.	"It's not painful," Betancourt said. "It was getting tight. That's all."	Enter Wilton Lopez (1-1), who threw a perfect inning to earn the win.	Jhoulys Chacin took a 4-0 lead and a one-hitter into the seventh, only to walk away with a no-decision after things unraveled as the Diamondbacks rallied to tie the game.	Unable to manage much early against the hard-throwing righty, Arizona loaded the bases with one out on two walks and an error. Jason Kubel hit a two-run double and Martin Prado followed with a two-run single that tied it at 4.	That was all for Chacin.	Manager Walt Weiss summoned reliever Josh Outman to quell the rally. He gave up a single and walked another to load the bases before striking out Gerardo Parra looking on a borderline pitch for the second out.	Parra threw his hands up in exasperation over the call from home plate umpire Adrian Johnson. Manager Kirk Gibson ran out of the dugout to guide his leadoff hitter away from the plate. Outman then struck out Didi Gregorius on a called third strike to end the threat. Gregorius also voiced his displeasure.	Chacin was in a groove the last time he faced the Diamondbacks on April 19, throwing 6 1/3 scoreless innings before leaving because of tightness in his back. The injury landed him on the 15-day disabled list.	He's struggled since his return on May 5, going 0-3 with a 7.79 ERA heading into Tuesday.	In this game, though, Chacin looked more like the ace of the staff. He gave up a double to Kennedy in the third and didn't allow another until the disastrous seventh. He gave up four runs -- three earned -- in 6 1/3 innings.	"Jhoulys was cruising had a tremendous outing going," Weiss said. "He lost a little command there in the seventh and it got away from him."	Kennedy came into the game with a 3.41 ERA at Coors Field, the second-best mark among active starters (with a minimum of 30 innings). And although he struggled early, Kennedy settled down enough to limit the damage. He lasted six innings and gave up four runs -- three earned -- in the no-decision.	"He did OK," Gibson said. "He kept us in the game. We came back and tied it. The bullpen just couldn't hold it tonight."	Tulowitzki hit his ninth homer of the season in the third, sending an 89-mph fastball from Kennedy into the left-field bleachers. Before the All-Star shortstop's shot, Arizona pitchers hadn't allowed a homer in seven games.	Colorado jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the second on back-to-back RBI singles from Nolan Arenado and D.J. LeMahieu. Both players began the season at Triple-A Colorado Springs before being called up.	Rockies lefty Jorge De La Rosa will start Wednesday almost two years to the day when he tore a ligament in his elbow pitching against the Diamondbacks at Coors Field. He later underwent Tommy John surgery.	"It was a long rehab," said De La Rosa, who is 5-3 with a 3.58 ERA this season. "I'm glad I'm ready to go. I think I'm helping the team a little bit."	Game notes	Arizona 2B Aaron Hill (broken left hand) is slated to visit the doctor again next week. ... Rockies LHP Jeff Francis (groin) threw 25 pitches off the mound Tuesday. ... Tulowitzki hit a solo homer and had a double to raise his average to .406 at Coors Field this season.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Mike Trout even surprised himself in adding to his growing list of impressive big league achievements.	Trout hit for the cycle and drove in five runs, Josh Hamilton celebrated his 32nd birthday with a homer and a triple his first two times up, and Howie Kendrick also went deep in the Los Angeles Angels' 12-0 rout of the Seattle Mariners on Tuesday night.	Trout, last season's AL rookie of the year and MVP runner-up, became the youngest AL player to hit for the cycle and third youngest in the major leagues since 1930. He's also the sixth player in Angels history to complete the cycle and the first to do it since Chone Figgins on Sept. 16, 2006, at Texas.	"It was one of those nights," Trout said. "I didn't really think about it until about the eighth inning. And when I got on deck, I started feeling it a little bit. To be honest, I thought Josh was going to hit for the cycle after his those first two at-bats. I wasn't thinking about myself."	After taking a called third strike his first time up, Trout reached on an infield single in the third inning, hit an RBI triple in the fourth and added a three-run double in the sixth before homering in the eighth on a 2-0 pitch from Lucas Luetge.	"At 2-0, I think I was swinging at anything," Trout said. "It was in the back of my mind, trying to hit a home run. I just barreled it up and it went out. It feels great."	Jerome Williams (3-1) scattered six hits over eight innings, struck out six and walked two while helping send the Mariners to their season-high fifth straight loss. The right-hander got one more run of support as he did in his three-previous starts this season combined.	Aaron Harang (1-5) lasted only 3 2/3 innings in his first outing since May 7, giving up seven runs and nine hits -- seven of them for extra bases. The 35-year-old right-hander, who missed his previous turn in the rotation because of stiffness in his lower back, has yet to go more than six innings in any of his six starts with the Mariners.	"About the only good thing that came out of tonight was the fact that the back wasn't an issue," Harang said.	The Angels grabbed a 3-0 lead in the first. Erick Aybar led off with a double, Albert Pujols singled him home, and Hamilton drove a 3-2 pitch to left-center for his sixth homer. In the three previous games Hamilton played on his birthday in the major leagues, he did not have an RBI in 12 at-bats.	Los Angeles extended the margin to 7-0 in the fourth, scoring four runs on five extra-base hits. Hamilton legged out his second triple of the season leading off and Kendrick drove the next pitch to right-center for his seventh home run, one fewer than he had last year. Alberto Callaspo followed with a double, Aybar drove him in with a two-out double, and Trout chased Harang with his triple to right-center.	"We saw him do a lot of these things last year as a leadoff guy, and now he's hitting in the two spot," Kendrick said. "He's a great player and he has the ability do some of the things he's done -- especially being a five-tool player like he is."	Luetge followed Danny Farquhar out of the Seattle bullpen during the Angels' four-run sixth, giving up Trout's three-run double on his first pitch. Pujols got an RBI single two pitches later to give the Angels an 11-0 cushion.	The Mariners threatened in the third before Kyle Seager grounded into an inning-ending double play with runners at first and second. At the time, Seager had the most at-bats by any AL player who hadn't grounded into one (168).	The game marked the return to Angel Stadium of Mariners first baseman/DH Kendrys Morales, following the December trade that sent the switch-hitter to Seattle for starting pitcher Jason Vargas. He was 1-for-4 with a ground-rule double and two strikeouts.	Game notes	Aybar left for a pinch hitter in the sixth due to soreness in his right knee. ... Angels LHP Sean Burnett was reinstated from the disabled list, bolstering an injury-ravaged bullpen that is still waiting for Ryan Madson and Kevin Jepsen to come off the DL while rookies Robert Coello and Dane De La Rosa fill the void. RHP Ryan Brasier, another rookie reliever, was optioned to Triple-A Salt Lake to clear a roster spot for Burnett -- who missed 22 games because of irritation in his forearm. ... Mariners SS Brendan Ryan, 0 for 14 lifetime against Williams, got the night off. ... Harang's next start will be his 300th in the majors. ... Angels ace Jered Weaver, sidelined since April 8 because of a broken bone in his non-pitching arm, is scheduled to throw in an extended spring training game at the team's Arizona complex on Wednesday and may not need a minor league rehab assignment. "There's only so much you can get done in minor league rehab starts," manager Mike Scioscia said. "We definitely want to control this and get him into a five-inning look with 75 to 80 pitches, and we can accomplish that down there. I think that where he lines up after that is going to be contingent on how he feels coming out of it."	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

SAN DIEGO --  Adam Wainwright got a nice, loud ovation from the large contingent of St. Louis Cardinals fans behind the third-base dugout as he walked off the mound with an eight-run lead with one out in the bottom of the eighth inning.	It was his first victory at Petco Park, yet it almost had the feel of being at home.	"That was an awesome, awesome Cardinal reaction today," Wainwright said after the Cardinals beat the San Diego Padres 10-2 Tuesday night. "That was pretty special. It's not rare for our fans to show up, but it's rare for our fans to be louder than the home fans. When I walked off today it definitely felt like a home game.	"They're special people, St. Louis fans. We're spoiled rotten playing in front of them all the time."	The fans also got to cheer Daniel Descalso's first career grand slam and his career-high five RBIs.	Wainwright (6-3) held San Diego to one run and four hits in 7 1/3 innings, struck out six and walked one.	The 6-foot-7 right-hander had been 0-2 with a 2.57 ERA in his previous three appearances at the spacious downtown ballpark, including two starts. That leaves New York's Citi Field as the only NL park where Wainwright has never earned a victory.	"I've thrown a couple of good games here," Wainwright said. "It's a pitcher's park through and through. They've still got some big hitters over there, though, so you never can get too comfortable if they've got a lineup with some guys who can do some damage."	The only run Wainwright allowed came in the second, when rookie Jedd Gyorko doubled and eventually scored on Alexi Amarista's double-play ball. Gyorko had three hits.	"Wainwright was just a little too much for us," Padres manager Bud Black said. "We couldn't really solve Wainwright. He wasn't really commanding the ball the first couple of innings, then he took off."	Said Padres catcher John Baker: "If you give him a three- or four-run lead, he throws strikes, works fast and the defense plays well behind him."	Descalso lined a 1-2 pitch from Anthony Bass into the Jack Daniel's Old No. 7 Deck in right-center with one out in the eighth, his second homer of the season. Jon Jay was intentionally walked ahead of him.	"It was a slider that caught a lot of the plate and I covered it and it got out," Descalso said. "It's nice to hit a grand slam but I would have taken a sac fly there. As long as I have a productive at-bat there it doesn't matter what it was."	Descalso, hitting just .197 coming in, went 3 for 3 with a walk and scored three runs. He missed the cycle by a triple. He singled leading off the third and scored on Matt Carpenter's double. He hit an RBI double in the four-run fifth and scored on Carlos Beltran's two-run single.	Matt Holliday struck out opening the eighth but reached on Bass' wild pitch and Allen Craig singled. Padres first baseman Yonder Alonso tried for a reverse double play on Yadier Molina's grounder but his wide throw pulled shortstop Everth Cabrera off the bag and Craig was safe. Jay was intentionally walked and Descalso hit his slam.	San Diego's Edinson Volquez (3-5) allowed five runs and eight hits in six innings, struck out five and walked one. He allowed four runs on six hits in the fifth.	Game notes	 Padres lefty Clayton Richard made his second rehab start with Triple-A Tucson at Omaha, allowing two earned runs on five hits in six innings, with four strikeouts and no walks. ... Cardinals 3B David Freese was out of the lineup for the second straight game. He got three stitches in the base of his right thumb after getting spiked by Milwaukee's Norichika Aoki while tagging him out during a rundown Sunday. ... Padres LF Carlos Quentin sat out with a balky right knee. He had an awkward slide into home in Monday night's 4-2 victory. ... The series concludes Wednesday night when St. Louis LHP Tyler Lyons is scheduled to make his big league debut against rookie RHP Burch Smith (0-0, 15.63).  Lyons will be the second Cardinals lefty in nine days (John Gast, May 4 vs. New York Mets) to make his big league debut in a start. Lyons was a ninth-round pick out of Oklahoma State in the 2010 draft.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Sweating, sniffling and sneezing, Pablo Sandoval felt horrible until his final swing.	Sandoval hit a towering two-run home run in the bottom of the 10th inning after Gregor Blanco's tying triple in the ninth, and the San Francisco Giants rallied past the Washington Nationals 4-2 on Tuesday night.	"You have to give 100 percent no matter what. It's your job to fight," said Sandoval, who was so dehydrated he had to receive intravenous fluids before the game.	Saddled with flu-like symptoms all week, Sandoval flipped his bat and shifted into a slow trot as soon as he sent the changeup off Yunesky Maya (0-1) over the right-center field wall for his eighth homer this season. It was Sandoval's second career game-ending hit -- both home runs against the Nationals -- and San Francisco's sixth walk-off win this year.	The ball landed just shy of the plaque on the brick wall marking Barry Bonds' record-breaking 756th home run.	"I don't think Bonds ever hit one that high," said Matt Cain, who allowed two runs in seven innings.	Blanco finished 3 for 4, including the RBI triple off closer Rafael Soriano with two outs in the ninth. The Giants' comeback upstaged a superb outing by Stephen Strasburg. Both starters lasted seven innings in a matchup of NL aces.	Jeremy Affelft (1-0) tossed a scoreless inning for the win.	Maya had been called up from Triple-A Syracuse earlier in the day after the Nationals placed reliever Ryan Mattheus on the 15-day disabled list. Mattheus broke his right pitching hand punching a locker following a loss at San Diego on Sunday.	"I don't feel good because I didn't make a zero and (keep) the game tied," Maya said.	Washington's fourth consecutive loss might be its most painful.	Buster Posey hit an infield single leading off the ninth against Soriano and was lifted for pinch-runner Andres Torres. With San Francisco down to its last strike, Blanco sent an 84 mph slider over the head of right fielder Bryce Harper for the tying triple.	Harper said he was thinking about the play last week when he ran face-first into the wall in a scary collision against the Dodgers and needed 11 stitches in his chin. He also missed two games because of a bruised left knee before coming back Monday night.	"I should have caught it. I put that whole loss on me," Harper said.	The Giants earned their 13th comeback win this season. After entering the game just 2-17 when trailing after the eighth inning, they handed Soriano his second straight blown save and third in 15 chances this year.	"We love pressure. It's our favorite part," Sandoval said.	What started out as a scintillating matchup on the mound faded at the finish.	Strasburg struck out seven and allowed five hits and three walks. Cain gave up four hits and two walks while striking out seven.	Strasburg had his changeup confusing hitters most of the night. He retired 14 of the final 15 batters -- six on strikeouts -- and never allowed a runner past first in his last five innings.	Ian Desmond and Ryan Zimmerman each hit an RBI double in the first to give the Nationals a 2-0 lead. Blanco singled, took second on Cain's sacrifice and hustled home on Angel Pagan's single in the second for San Francisco's only run off Strasburg.	Cain worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the fourth. He got Kurt Suzuki to ground into a fielder's choice and Strasburg struck out swinging after an appeal to first base umpire Gary Darling.	Neither starter faced a serious threat the rest of the way.	Marco Scutaro extended his hitting streak to 19 games -- the longest in the majors this season -- when he doubled off the left-field wall against Tyler Clippard with two outs in the eighth. Sandoval followed with a weak grounder to second to end the inning, then atoned for the out his next time up.	Sandoval's other game-ending hit came at Washington on May 12, 2009.	"He didn't show any effects from the bug there," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "He's got better discipline (at the plate) now. He's got more patience."	Game notes	Several Nationals players wore a T-shirt in the clubhouse that had a younger image of pitching coach Steve McCatty shirtless from when he posed for Playgirl magazine's July 1984 issue after the photo recently surfaced on the Internet. The back of the shirt had the slogan: "Untuck." "I could have done without that revelation," manager Davey Johnson joked. "I didn't know he had that good a body, and I didn't know he had that much hair." ... Bochy said Johnson will be on his coaching staff for the NL All-Star team. "He's all set to go. I have tremendous respect for Davey," Bochy said. ...

ATLANTA -- Evan Gattis no longer seems amazed by his improbable rookie season.	Yet, there are still times when it's a bit of an adjustment for the Atlanta Braves catcher.	Like when someone recognizes him in the grocery store.	"It's a little weird," the 26-year-old Gattis said. "I'm not used to that yet."	Gattis did it again Wednesday, hitting his first career grand slam. B.J. Upton and Ramiro Pena also homered for the Braves, who finished off a sweep of the woeful Minnesota Twins with an 8-3 rout.	The Braves stretched their winning streak to six games with a second straight series sweep, making things easy for starter Paul Maholm (6-4). The left-hander held the Twins to an unearned run in 7 1/3 innings.	With the Braves already leading 4-0, Gattis struck again less than 24 hours after his two-out, pinch-homer in the ninth allowed the Braves to pull out a 5-4 win over the Twins in extra innings.	"It's legend," manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "Good for him. The guys really rally around him and enjoy being around him."	Gattis was swinging away on a 3-0 pitch with the bases loaded in the fourth and launched an opposite-field drive just inside the right-field pole for his 10th homer of the season.	As Gattis rounded the bases, the theme from "The Natural" played over the speakers at Turner Field.	In the Atlanta dugout, Upton looked on in disbelief, both arms in the air as if to say, "Is this really happening?"	Believe it.	Gattis made the team as a non-roster player in spring training after quitting baseball during college, working a variety of odd jobs, and dealing with bouts of depression that had him contemplating suicide. He still has a picture of his ID card from working as a janitor on his Twitter page.	He returned to baseball after nearly four years away, having completed what he calls a spiritual journey. He earned a roster spot and got extensive playing time in April while the Braves battled injuries, earning the NL rookie of the month honors.	Now, with all the regulars back in the lineup, he's making the most of his more limited chances in May.	There was one stumble on the day, however.	After Cory Rasmus, making his major league debut, got his first strikeout, Gattis flipped the ball to a little girl in the stands.	"We've got to teach him a little more court awareness," Gonzalez quipped.	Not surprisingly, Gattis' teammates were ragging him about the faux pas in the clubhouse.	"I wasn't even thinking about it," he said, shaking his head. "I don't know what to say."	Gattis' dramatic homer Tuesday was his third as a pinch-hitter, and it was the fourth time he's hit a tying or go-ahead homer in the eighth inning or later. He got the start at catcher for the series finale, giving Brian McCann the day off.	"I love this team," Gattis said. "All of our pitchers, relievers, everybody in the whole lineup, we all contribute, we've all got roles, we've all got things we do to help this team. It's a good feeling right now in the clubhouse. We're playing good baseball."	The Twins, not so much. They lost their eighth in a row and demoted starting pitcher Vance Worley to the minors right after the game.	Worley (1-5) lasted only 3 2/3 innings, surrendering eight runs and 10 hits. He also hit two batters and walked two more, his ERA climbing to 7.21. It would have been worse if Pena had not been thrown out at the plate in the first attempting to score on a flyout to left fielder Josh Willingham.	"I went out there and I left the ball up just a little bit. My ERA's killing me. It's hard to win a game if you're behind," said Worley, who was sent to Triple-A Rochester.	"They haven't seen what I'm capable of doing ever since I got here. It's been a battle and I've just got to figure it out. This whole spring up to this point, I haven't been consistent whatsoever."	Before leaving, Worley's horrendous problems in the first continued when he allowed two hits and a walk, including Jason Heyward's run-scoring single. In 10 starts, the right-hander has allowed 17 runs and 24 hits in the opening inning.	Atlanta made it 3-0 in the third. Pena hit his second homer of the season and, after Worley plunked a pair of hitters, Chris Johnson came through with a two-out single to bring in another run.	The Braves blew it open in the fourth. Upton, hitting just .153 coming in, led off with a homer into the seats in left-center. After Maholm's flyout, Jordan Schafer singled, Heyward singled, Freddie Freeman walked and Gattis went deep to finish off Worley and the Twins.	"He said he felt good. The ball was coming out of his hand pretty decent," manager Ron Gardenhire said of his pitcher. "We saw some fastballs at 92, 93. But ultimately, he misfires too much over the plate and you see the ball flying. And that's what happened today. When he gets the ball up, they whack it pretty good."	Minnesota's only run off Maholm came after Johnson's error at third base set up Justin Morneau's RBI single in the sixth.	Aaron Hicks and pinch-hitter Oswaldo Arcia homered in the ninth off Rasmus, making his major league debut.	Game notes	The Twins placed 3B Trevor Plouffe on the seven-day DL with a concussion. He took a blow to the head in the 10th inning of Tuesday night's game while breaking up an attempted double play. ... Minnesota called up former independent league star Chris Colabello, who was batting .358 at Triple-A Rochester and leading the International League with 12 homers and a .659 slugging percentage. Colabello got the news after midnight on a bus ride from Allentown back to Rochester, just made an early morning flight to Atlanta and was in the lineup for the 12:10 p.m. start, playing right field and batting sixth. He went 0 for 4 with two strikeouts in his major league debut at age 30. ... The Braves already have swept five series this season. ... Rasmus is the younger brother of Toronto OF Colby Rasmus.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

MILWAUKEE --  Los Angeles manager Don Mattingly has been sharply critical of his slumping team.	For at least one day, everything was all right with the embattled Dodgers.	Carl Crawford and Scott Van Slyke drove in two runs each and Ramon Hernandez hit his first home run in the Dodgers' 9-2 win over the Milwaukee Brewers on Wednesday.	Even after the win, the Dodgers are last in the NL West at 19-26.	Rookie Hyun-Jin Ryu (5-2), given a 7-0 lead, allowed two runs and six hits in a season-high 7 1/3 innings. Ryu has allowed two earned runs or fewer in seven of his 10 appearances.	"The team gave me that lead, so I was really comfortable," Ryu said through an interpreter.	Before the game, Mattingly expressed his unhappiness with the team and benched All-Star right fielder Andre Ethier.	Mattingly, in the third and final year of his contract, discussed his club's lack of mental toughness and said he wanted a balanced team that has grit and fight.	He benched Ethier for the third time in six games and said he was "putting out my lineup that I feel is going to be the most competitive and going to compete the hardest."	Ethier was not informed of what his manager said until after the game by a member of the team's media relations staff, and said he took offense to the comment.	"I'm struggling just like everyone else here to get a grip and get a handle on what's going on here, and never losing hope of what our main goal is," Ethier said. "Which is to figure this out and turn things around. And figure out a way to get back on top of this division."	Asked whether he thought Mattingly would be managing on Friday when the Dodgers open a series against the Cardinals, Ethier said, "Why not? We're not out of this by far. We're right there -- I don't mean right there -- but we're close.	"A good run the next month or two could put us right back where we want to be by the All-Star break. We have confidence in everyone in this room and everyone on this staff. Other than the pressure put on this team to perform right away and do what's it's done is the reason why these issues are coming up."	After the game, Mattingly was asked if he was worried about getting fired.	"No, not really," Mattingly said. "Should I be?	The manager then chuckled, and added, "I'm not worried. Maybe I should be."	Every position player for Los Angeles except Adrian Gonzalez had at least one hit.	Milwaukee starter Wily Peralta (3-5) gave up six runs -- four earned -and seven hits in 1 2/3 innings.	"I'm leaving too many pitches up, right down the middle, up in the zone," said Peralta after losing his third straight start. "Things are not happening my way."	Matt Kemp hit a run-scoring single in the first, and Los Angeles sent 11 batters to the plate in a five-run second.	Crawford had a two-run single, and Hernandez came home on an error by shortstop Jean Segura. Peralta then issued consecutive bases-loaded walks to Van Slyke and Nick Punto, his final two batters.	"(Peralta) left some balls up, but some were not hit that well and snuck between out infielders," Milwaukee manager Ron Roenicke said. "His command left him a little bit."	Hernandez, making just his sixth start of the season, homered off Alfredo Figaro leading off the third for his first home run since Sept. 2 for Colorado.	Ryan Braun homered in the sixth for the Brewers, his first since May 10 and ninth overall.	Game notes	 Hernandez leads active catchers with 160 homers. ... The Brewers are 1-6 on Wednesdays. ... Milwaukee RHP Kyle Lohse will miss his next scheduled turn in the rotation because irritation in his throwing elbow. Mike Fiers (1-2) is slated to start in place of Lohse (1-5) on Saturday against visiting Pittsburgh.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK -- Brandon Phillips and the Cincinnati Reds are getting the good bounces right now. Ike Davis and the New York Mets certainly are not.	Phillips sent a strange double spinning over first base to break a ninth-inning tie and the Reds completed a three-game sweep of the struggling Mets with a 7-4 victory Wednesday.	Joey Votto homered and Zack Cozart had a career-high four hits, all off Matt Harvey, in a game that featured a little bit of everything -- including a testy exchange in the dugout between Cincinnati starter Mat Latos and teammate Jay Bruce.	"It was just an issue between the team and it's going to stay that way," Bruce said. "The only reason anyone knows about it is because the TVs caught it, but stuff happens all the time. It's over. We're a team, we're a family. Things like that happen, so everything's good and it's a non-issue."	After their spat, the Reds regrouped and won for the 10th time in 12 games. They finished a 7-2 trip against the bottom three teams in the NL East, moving a season-best 11 games over .500 at 29-18.	"We closed it out strong. We won the last three innings even though they made it tough and they had the winning run on second a couple times," manager Dusty Baker said. "We were kind of flirting with danger quite a few times, but our defense saved us."	Harvey appeared headed for his first loss of the season before the Mets rallied.	Rick Ankiel had three extra-base hits and two RBIs for New York, including a tying triple with two outs in the seventh. Daniel Murphy added three hits and drove in two runs from the leadoff spot.	With the score tied at 4 in the ninth, Shin-Soo Choo legged out a leadoff double against Bobby Parnell (4-1) and reached third on a groundout. Votto was intentionally walked before Phillips hit a cue shot toward first base.	The ball hit the baseline and bounced over Davis' glove in front of the bag. Determining he had no chance to throw out Choo at the plate or start an inning-ending double play, Davis shied away from touching the ball -- thinking it would go foul. But it bounded over the bag and was called fair by umpire Phil Cuzzi.	"Instinct told me not to catch the ball," Davis said, adding he still wasn't sure if it was fair or foul even after watching replays. "It just wasn't the right play, I guess."	Choo scored the tiebreaking run and Davis was left shaking his head as Mets manager Terry Collins came out to argue.	"Anytime you lose a game it's not fun -- especially on a play like that," Davis said. "Everything that can go wrong right now for me is going wrong."	Pinch-hitter Todd Frazier fisted a two-run single into center to make it 7-4.	Alfredo Simon (4-1) worked around Cozart's throwing error in the eighth, and Aroldis Chapman got his 10th save in 12 tries.	New York fell to 2-11 in its past 13 home games.	"I made all my pitches, hit all my spots," Parnell said. "Broken bats and little flairs. What can you do?"	In a matchup of unbeaten young right-handers, Harvey and Latos took a 2-all duel into the seventh, when Cozart sparked a Reds rally with his fourth hit. Votto also singled and Phillips grounded an RBI single just inside third base.	That was it for Harvey, who walked off to a warm ovation from a crowd of 30,415 that included more than 8,000 area students on Weather Education Day at Citi Field.	Bruce's run-scoring groundout gave Latos a two-run lead, but he couldn't hold it. Murphy hit an RBI single with two outs in the seventh and Ankiel tripled high off the left-field wall to tie it.	J.J. Hoover retired David Wright on a popup to keep the score tied.	Harvey was charged with four runs and a season-high nine hits in 6 1/3 innings. He had allowed three runs or fewer in 16 straight starts dating to last season.	"It's not like they crushed him," Mets catcher John Buck said. "They did do a good job of making him throw a little bit more, working counts, making him pitch to get them out."	Murphy and Ankiel gave the Mets a quick lead with consecutive doubles to start the first inning.	Cozart doubled in the third and Votto went the other way with a 3-0 pitch for his seventh home run, extending his hitting streak to 11 games.	In the bottom half, Cozart robbed Wright of a run-scoring hit with a diving grab at shortstop. Lucas Duda also lined out to end the inning and Latos took that 2-1 lead into the fifth, when Ruben Tejada hit a leadoff double and advanced on Harvey's sacrifice bunt. Murphy hit a sacrifice fly to shallow right, and Tejada scored with surprising ease when Bruce's weak throw was off target.	After the inning, cameras caught Latos and Bruce having an animated argument in the dugout.	Latos wouldn't comment, and Bruce said "there's really nothing to talk about."	"It happens all the time. It's really nobody's business but ours," Baker said.	Game notes	Jack Hannahan started at 3B in place of Frazier because Baker wanted to get another left-handed bat in the lineup against Harvey. Baker said he'd been thinking about giving Hannahan a start at 1B soon, but Votto has been too hot to sit. ... Davis has one hit in his last 38 at-bats after going 0 for 2 with two walks. He flied out to the center-field warning track to end the sixth, leaving him hitless in his last 25 at-bats with runners in scoring position.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- Ross Wolf was thinking about retirement while languishing in the minor leagues for a third straight year.	The Texas Rangers right-hander will probably reconsider now.	Wolf pitched five strong innings for his first big league win in his first start in the majors, David Murphy and Adrian Beltre homered in a three-run first inning, and the Rangers avoided a sweep with a 3-1 victory against the Oakland Athletics on Wednesday.	The 30-year-old Wolf came up from Triple-A Round Rock for a spot start after the Rangers scratched rookie Nick Tepesch because of a blister.	He beamed in front of the cameras afterward and said "awesome" a lot after escaping trouble in the fourth and fifth and getting a big boost from Neal Cotts when he was replaced in the sixth.	A year ago, Wolf (1-0) had a pregnant wife on bed rest and a boy who missed him at home while be bounced between Double-A Frisco and Round Rock in the Texas farm system.	He spent 2011 in the Houston organization after refusing a minor league assignment with Oakland at the end of the 2010 season.	"It tests your patience," said Wolf, who was making his first big league appearance since Oct. 1, 2010, as a reliever for the A's. "My wife gets a lot of the credit. She told me to stick with it, and thank God I did."	Cotts, pitching a day after getting three outs on six pitches in his first game in the majors since May 25, 2009, struck out the side when he came on for Wolf with two runners on and no outs in the sixth.	The left-hander whose best season came with the Chicago White Sox when they won the World Series in 2005 escaped trouble again in the seventh, getting Adam Rosales on a lineout and Coco Crisp on a foul pop with a runner at third.	"He may have been here in Texas a short time, but he hasn't been at the major league level being successful for a short time," Rangers manager Ron Washington said. "He's throwing the ball the way I remember him throwing with Chicago."	Joe Nathan pitched a perfect ninth for his 14th save in 14 chances.	Elvis Andrus snapped an 0-for-10 slump with a leadoff single in the first, and Murphy followed with a homer about 10 rows into the lower porch in right field. Two batters later, Beltre hit his 10th of the season halfway up the lawn in center.	Jarrod Parker (2-6) was down 3-0 just four batters into the game, but went seven innings for Oakland. The right-hander retired 11 of the next 12 Rangers after Beltre's homer and allowed six hits with five strikeouts and one walk in seven innings.	"He threw a couple of early-count heaters that they squared up," Oakland manager Bob Melvin said. "In the past, early in the season, that game gets away from him. It looks like he's more comfortable now."	Wolf, who had 25 career relief appearances, retired the first nine hitters and gave up one run with three strikeouts and two walks in five-plus innings.	It was the second time in three days a Texas pitcher has made his first major league start after previous stints as a reliever with other teams. Josh Lindblom lost to Oakland on Monday.	"For him to come up and pitch against his old team and get his first big league win, it's cool to say you were a part of it," catcher A.J. Pierzynski said.	The A's scored their only run on a sacrifice fly by Brandon Moss with runners at second and third and one in the fourth against Wolf, who was 1-2 with a 2.02 ERA in Round Rock, including a 1.85 ERA in six starts.	Oakland, which had a five-game winning streak snapped, put runners at second and third with no outs in the fifth when Andrus made a sliding catch over his shoulder on a blooper into left from Eric Sogard. Wolf then got Rosales on an infield popup and Crisp on a grounder.	"I think it meant everything to anyone that's in the game of baseball that have a dream," Washington said. "I think he did a great job of going through a hot team."	Game notes	Rangers RHP Cory Burns was optioned to Round Rock to make room for Wolf. ... Tepesch is scheduled to start Sunday at Seattle, and Yu Darvish will pitch the first game of a day-night doubleheader in Arizona on Monday. The second starter is undecided. ... A's SS Jed Lowrie didn't start after getting hit by a pitch on his right foot Tuesday night. ... Oakland OF Josh Reddick (sprained right wrist) was eligible to come off the DL Wednesday and will join the team Friday in Houston for limited batting practice.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DENVER -- The Colorado Rockies are surging this May instead of swooning.	With Memorial Day approaching, the Rockies are actually right on the heels of the NL West leaders, especially after going 5-2 on their recent home stand.	"Back on track," Carlos Gonzalez proudly proclaimed.	Indeed, they are.	Gonzalez homered and drove in two runs, Jorge De La Rosa pitched effectively into the sixth and the Rockies beat Arizona 4-1 on Wednesday to take two of three from the Diamondbacks.	Dexter Fowler had two hits in his first start in the cleanup spot as the Rockies caught Arizona in the standings.	And with a San Francisco loss later in the day, the Rockies, Diamondbacks and Giants are now all tied for first in the division at 26-21.	Last season, the Rockies started solidly enough, only to slide in May and fade the rest of the way to finish with a franchise-worst 98 losses.	After winning series over San Francisco and Arizona, the Rockies' swagger has returned.	"This is a good feeling and creates a lot of motivation for us," said Gonzalez, whose team was 18-29 last season at this point and 14 games out of first.	De La Rosa (6-3) kept up his mastery against Arizona at Coors Field, improving to 8-0 with a 1.38 ERA. He struck out five and allowed six hits in 5 1/3 innings.	Relievers Edgmer Escalona and Matt Belisle bottled up Arizona to get the ball to Rex Brothers, who closed the ninth with Rafael Betancourt sidelined by a groin injury. It was Brothers' first save of the season, prodded by some motivational words from catcher Yorvit Torrealba.	"He came out and said, `Pretend like it's the eighth. I'm tired. Hurry up," Brothers said.	Trevor Cahill (3-5) didn't have his best stuff early, but found his groove and made it through six innings, allowing four runs. Cahill has allowed four earned runs or fewer in 28 straight starts, which is the longest active streak in the majors.	"It is tough here," Cahill said. "The ball doesn't move as much. But I got more command as the game went on."	Gonzalez hit Cahill hard all afternoon, giving the Rockies an early lead when he sent a fastball over the right-field wall in the first. The player nicknamed CarGo drove in another run with a triple two innings later.	"Too good of a hitter throw pitches down the middle," Cahill said.	Manager Walt Weiss went with a rather unorthodox lineup, moving the speedy Fowler from his usual leadoff spot to cleanup. Weiss figured he would give Fowler a chance with Troy Tulowitzki receiving a rest day.	Fowler finished 2 for 4 with a double and scored a run.	There was some drama in the sixth when Fowler sent a high fly to right that appeared to hit off the wall in fair territory. But first base umpire Doug Eddings ruled it foul, which brought Weiss out to discuss the call.	The umpires briefly huddled on the field and headed in to look at the play, even though the hit in question didn't appear to be a home run (only home runs can be reviewed).	Television replays confirmed that Eddings made the correct call as a distinctive white mark was left on the green wall where the ball hit.	Trailing 4-0 in the fourth, the Diamondbacks scored a run when Wil Nieves' double to left-center brought in Cody Ross, who led off the inning with a single. De La Rosa got Josh Wilson to fly out to prevent any further damage.	De La Rosa also worked his way out of a jam in the third after allowing a double by Cahill and walking Didi Gregorius. Paul Goldschmidt hit a soft roller to third to end the threat.	The hard-throwing De La Rosa's start on Wednesday had some personal significance. It was nearly two years to the day when he tore a ligament in his elbow pitching against the Diamondbacks at Coors Field. He later underwent Tommy John surgery.	He said it was a long journey back, but De La Rosa appears on the right track. He lowered his ERA this season from 3.58 to 3.40.	"I think I can get a little more strength in my arm, but I can't complain," De La Rosa said. "My velocity's very good. All my breaking stuff is working very good. And I'm glad to feel the way I feel right now."	Even though Tulowitzki is hitting so well at home this season, Weiss elected to keep his shortstop out of the starting lineup.	It's all part of the plan to keep Tulowitzki healthy for a full season. They're agreeing on dates he will rest -- and sticking to it, no matter if he went, say, 2 for 4 with a homer like he did Tuesday night.	"We both knew coming into the season we had to do it this way," Weiss said. "I don't want to get into a situation where we say, `Well, he had two hits last night, I'm going to change my mind.' That's a trap.	"Of course, I want Tulo out there for 162 games. Who wouldn't? But we knew we were going to have to be smarter than that coming in. Who plays 162 games, anymore?"

SAN FRANCISCO --  This time, Bryce Harper made the catch. And yeah, it was a relief.	Harper made a game-saving grab in right field and had a couple of big hits at the plate to help the Washington Nationals beat the San Francisco Giants 2-1 in 10 innings on Wednesday.	San Francisco had runners on first and second with one out in the eighth when Harper had to dive to grab Hunter Pence's sinking liner in the gap, keeping it tied at 1. He banged up his left knee on the play, but managed to stay in the game.	"The trainer came up to me after the eighth and said Bryce hurt his knee again," Washington manager Davey Johnson said. "I didn't want to hear that. I could not imagine taking him out there. He said he was fine. We'll fix it tomorrow."	Harper is still recovering from his dangerous collision with the outfield wall in Los Angeles a week ago. He felt he should have made the catch on Gregor Blanco's tying triple in the ninth inning of San Francisco's 4-2 win on Tuesday night, acknowledging that the play against the Dodgers was on his mind.	So the play against Pence was a big lift for the 20-year-old phenom.	"I'm just glad I caught it," he said. "It's still in my head and I have to try and get past it. It's just going to take time."	Harper also hit his 12th homer in the sixth and sparked the winning rally with a one-out double. Ryan Zimmerman was walked intentionally before Ian Desmond had an RBI single against Jeremy Affeldt (1-1), helping the Nationals avoid a three-game series sweep.	Tyler Clippard (3-1) pitched a perfect 10th for the win and Rafael Soriano got three outs for his 14th save. He failed to convert each of his last two chances, including Tuesday night's loss.	Buster Posey hit a tying RBI single for San Francisco in the eighth. Marco Scutaro went 0 for 3 with two walks, ending his 19-game hitting streak. He flew out to deep left to end the game.	"We played well again today," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "Really it was their defense in the eighth that won the game. They made nice plays on Pence and Belt. We ran into a well-pitched game."	Both teams failed to muster much offense in a nice pitchers' duel between Gio Gonzalez of the Nationals and Giants left-hander Madison Bumgarner.	"It's never easy to give it up like that but I think we'll be OK," Bumgarner said. "They have a good team over there and they have as good a shot as anybody."	Gonzalez was charged with one run and four hits over 7 1/3 innings, throwing a season-high 116 pitches. Harper's leadoff drive was the only blemish for Bumgarner, who gave up four hits in seven innings.	"It's going to be a good plane ride home," Gonzalez said. "The defense and the bullpen kept us in it."	Bumgarner's first four outs were by strikeouts and five of the first eight. He did not strike out a batter after the third inning. He gave up a career-high nine runs -- seven earned -- in a season-low 4 2/3 innings last Friday at Colorado.	Gonzalez has been pitching better of late, giving up five runs over his last 29 innings after allowing 19 runs over his first 32 innings.	Angel Pagan made it to third with one out in the first, but Gonzalez struck out Pence and Brett Pill to end the inning.	"Gio pitched an unbelievable game," Desmond said. "He showed a lot of guts."	Gonzalez, who had his third consecutive no-decision, retired 15 of 16 hitters during one stretch.	Game notes	 Harper said his left knee was a little swollen. "Hopefully the swelling will go down," he said. "It was important to get this win and be able to go home and get comfortable." ... Attendance at AT&T Park reached 1,040,301 for the season in home game No. 25. ... The Nationals have hit at least one home run in 71 consecutive series. ... RHP Jordan Zimmermann (7-2, 1.62 ERA) takes the mound for the Nationals on Friday against the Philadelphia Phillies. ... RHP Tim Lincecum (3-3, 4.70 ERA) starts Friday's game for the Giants against the Colorado Rockies. ... Giants INF Pablo Sandoval was not in the starting lineup because of an illness. ... Giants 1B Brandon Belt felt tightness in his back and did not start. ... The Nationals ended their longest road trip of the season (10 games). ... Nationals OF Tyler Moore went 0 for 3 and is hitless in his last 21 at-bats.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

TORONTO -- Jose Bautista is one dangerous hitter, and he loves to come to the plate with the game on the line.	Bautista homered twice and drove in the winning run with a 10th-inning single, leading the Toronto Blue Jays to a 4-3 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays on Wednesday.	"He's not just a slugger; he's a complete hitter," Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. "He can do a lot of things with that bat."	The two-time major league home run champion said he thrives on hitting in key situations.	"I get a little more excited for those," Bautista said. "It was a huge moment and I'm just glad I was able to get the ball through that hole and drive in the winning run."	Bautista went 4-for-4 with a walk and four RBIs. Three other players had one hit, but that was it for Toronto's offense.	"He was the reason we won the game today," Blue Jays starter Mark Buehrle said.	Facing Cesar Ramos (1-1), Colby Rasmus reached on an infield single to begin the 10th. Rasmus moved to second on Emilio Bonifacio's sacrifice, then took third on Munenori Kawasaki's grounder. Pinch-hitter Mark DeRosa walked and Kyle Farnsworth came on to face Bautista, who fell behind 0-2 before lining a single into shallow right for the Blue Jays' first game-ending hit of the season.	"The win is huge," Bautista said. "We're obviously excited. Any time you have a walk-off win, it's exciting."	Aaron Loup (2-3) pitched one inning for the win as Toronto took two of three to win a series against Tampa Bay for the first time since August 2010. The Rays had won their past 15 series against the Blue Jays.	"It was pretty important to us," Bautista said. "It's a division game against a team that we haven't won a series against in a long time."	The teams were tied at 2 before Tampa Bay got a run in the ninth. Evan Longoria hit a one-out double off closer Casey Janssen, extending his hitting streak to 16 games. James Loney followed with an RBI single.	But Fernando Rodney couldn't nail down the save, yielding a leadoff home run to Bautista in the bottom half. It was Rodney's fourth blown save in 13 opportunities.	"I think I made a good pitch and he hit a good pitch," Rodney said. "When you have a type of hitter like that, like Bautista, and you make a good pitch and they hit your best pitch, there's nothing you can do."	The Rays have blown 28 leads this season, including four in the ninth inning.	"It's been kind of difficult," Rays manager Joe Maddon said. "That was another one that got away. Everybody is doing their best, they're trying. It's just not working out."	Bautista's 11th homer helped Janssen avoid his first loss since April 26, 2012, at Baltimore. Bautista said he feels comfortable facing Rodney, who had 48 saves in 50 chances last year, but refused to explain why.	"I think I have a different approach than everybody else," Bautista said. "I feel pretty comfortable at the plate when he's on the mound. That's pretty much all I can say about that."	Bautista also hit a leadoff drive in the fourth off Jeremy Hellickson. It was his second multihomer game of the season and No. 19 for his career.	"Bautista had himself a pretty good day today," Maddon said.	Toronto is the first team in the majors this season to have three players with 10 or more home runs. Edwin Encarnacion has 12 and J.P. Arencibia has 10.	Rodney got Encarnacion to ground out but was replaced after walking Adam Lind. Joel Peralta came on and sent it to extra innings by fanning Arencibia and retiring Brett Lawrie on a foulout.	Hellickson bounced back after giving up career highs of eight runs and 10 hits against Baltimore in his last outing. He allowed two runs and four hits in a season-high eight innings.	"He did really well," Maddon said. "That was more like Helly tonight."	Anthony Gose doubled on Hellickson's first pitch of the game and scored when Bautista followed with a single. But Bautista was thrown out trying to advance to second on Encarnacion's fly ball to left, and Hellickson set down his next seven batters.	The Rays took advantage of an error by second baseman Maicer Izturis to score two runs in the third. Jose Molina hit a one-out single and Desmond Jennings drew a two-out walk. Ryan Roberts hit a slow roller toward second but Izturis came up empty on an attempt to barehand the ball, allowing Molina to score. Ben Zobrist followed with an RBI single.	The Blue Jays tied it again, and snapped Hellickson's streak of eight straight outs, when Bautista crushed the first pitch of the fourth into the second deck in left.	Buehrle allowed two runs and four hits in seven innings, matching his longest outing of the season. Buehrle has not won since April 15 against the Chicago White Sox, a span of seven starts.	Buehrle struck out four straight in the second and third, and ended his outing by recording 11 straight outs.	Game notes	Longoria started at DH but came on as a defensive replacement at third base in the ninth. ... Rays rookie RHP Jake Odorizzi will get an extra day of rest before his next start, Monday against Miami. The move means RHP Alex Cobb will start on regular rest on Sunday against the Yankees. ... The Blue Jays said RHP Josh Johnson (right triceps) will make his second rehab start with Triple-A Buffalo on Saturday. Johnson pitched three innings for Class-A Dunedin on Monday.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BALTIMORE -- A series that began with a disheartening defeat ended in uplifting fashion for the Baltimore Orioles.	Chris Davis went 4-for-4, including his AL-leading 14th homer, and Baltimore got a three-run shot from Matt Wieters in a 6-3 victory over the New York Yankees on Wednesday night.	Nick Markakis added a solo home run for the Orioles, who took two of three from New York to pull within three games of the first-place Yankees in the AL East.	In the opener Monday night, Baltimore closer Jim Johnson blew a ninth-inning lead and Baltimore absorbed its sixth straight loss. The Orioles rebounded to win in 10 innings on Tuesday night before coasting in the finale.	"Anytime a division rival comes in, you want to try to win the series especially when you're at home," Davis said. "We avoided the snowball effect to some degree and were able to get back on track."	Jason Hammel (6-2) gave up two runs and seven hits in 6 2/3 innings to even his lifetime record against the Yankees to 3-3. The right-hander allowed a combined 13 earned runs over 8 2/3 innings in his previous two starts.	In part because Hammel got back on track, so did the Orioles.	"It's huge, especially after losing six in a row," he said. "To come out and play these guys toe to toe and come out with two out of three, I think, is pretty good."	Yankees starter Hiroki Kuroda left in the third with a bruised right calf, one inning after he was struck in the leg by a line drive off the bat of Manny Machado. Kuroda (6-3) allowed five runs and eight hits in two-plus innings.	"I wasn't too worried about the injury beyond tonight but was worried that it might matter tonight and it did," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "I thought he had trouble pushing off it. It was unfortunate that he was hit by the ball."	Girardi suspected Kuroda would be able to make his next start, but the right-hander wasn't sure.	"It will depend on how I feel tomorrow, but for me, I'm going to make that start," Kuroda said through a translator.	Curtis Granderson homered, doubled and singled for New York. Needing a triple to reach the cycle, he drew a walk in the seventh inning.	Playing in his seventh game since returning from a broken wrist, Granderson batted leadoff and played center field for the first time. He came in batting .174.	"It's like an opening week of the season for me. No different," he said before the game.	Girardi said, "I liked how he was swinging the bat. I thought it was a matter of time before he started getting some hits. He swung the bat great tonight."	David Adams hit a ninth-inning homer for the Yankees, his second in three games. The teams combined for 13 home runs in the series, including five in the finale.	After Kuroda retired the first two batters he faced, Markakis homered. Adam Jones followed with a single and Davis hit a 3-2 pitch over the wall in center.	In the second, Nate McLouth singled with two outs, stole second and took third on Machado's single off Kuroda's leg. Although Markakis hit a fly to end the threat, at that point the Orioles had six hits -- one more than Kuroda allowed in his complete game shutout against Baltimore on April 14.	The Yankees got a run back in the third when Granderson doubled and scored on a single by Robinson Cano.	But Baltimore pulled away in the bottom half. Jones doubled and after Davis singled, Kuroda grimaced near the mound. A discussion involving the New York trainer, Kuroda and Girardi ensued. The right-hander eventually walked off the field.	Preston Claiborne entered, and Wieters homered on the rookie's second pitch. It was the first run allowed by Claiborne after seven straight scoreless outings in the majors.	Granderson homered in the fifth to make it 6-2.	Game notes	The Orioles will recall RHP Kevin Gausman on Thursday, and the 22-year-old will make his major league debut against Toronto. Gausman was the fourth overall pick in the 2012 draft. ... After a day off Thursday, the Yankees begin a three-game series on the road against Tampa Bay. ... Orioles INF prospect Jonathan Schoop will need 6-8 weeks rest after an MRI revealed a stress fracture in his lower back, Orioles VP Dan Duquette said. ... New York 1B Mark Teixeira (wrist) and INF Kevin Youkilis (lumbar spine sprain) faced six minor league pitchers in a simulated game at the team complex in Tampa, Fla. ... Ichiro Suzuki extended his hitting streak at Camden Yards to 21 games.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- C.J. Wilson and the Los Angeles Angels celebrated Arte Moreno's 10 years as owner by cruising to another easy victory over the slumping Seattle Mariners.	Wilson struck out 10 in eight innings, Josh Hamilton had a two-run single and the Angels beat the Mariners 7-1 on Wednesday for their season-high fourth straight victory.	On the 10th anniversary of the day Moreno assumed control of the franchise from the Walt Disney Co., Wilson helped Los Angeles to an appropriate gift for the owner. Since Moreno took over, the Angels have won five AL West titles under manager Mike Scioscia and made the playoffs one other time as a wild card.	"You have to have an owner that's committed -- not only to bringing in new guys, but also retaining guys," Wilson said. "I think people look for the big splashes like Albert Pujols and Josh Hamilton and myself as free agents. But we saw Jered Weaver, Howie Kendrick and Erick Aybar get the long-term deals, and we also have guys like Mark Trumbo and Mike Trout who are going to be keystones of this organization going forth. Those things are essential as well. So Arte's going to do what has to be done."	Wilson (4-3) allowed a run and six hits in his longest outing since June 8, 2012, when he also went eight innings in a 7-2 interleague victory at Colorado. The left-hander won for the first time since May 1 at Oakland after losing his previous three starts, including back-to-back 3-0 decisions against Chris Sale of the Chicago White Sox.	The Mariners closed out a 2-7 road trip with their season-worst sixth straight loss, leaving them seven games under .500. After the game, some of the veterans initiated a closed-door clubhouse meeting.	"We just felt that it was a good time for it. It was a necessary thing to do," said outfielder Raul Ibanez, who is in his third stint with the Mariners. "It's important to remember all the good stuff that's happened with us. I think we've got a good group of guys, guys that are going to fight and guys that are going to scratch and claw. So we're going to be all right."	Seattle rookie Brandon Maurer (2-6) made his first major league start near his hometown of Newport Beach, and it was a disaster. The right-hander, who played his high school ball a few miles away from Angel Stadium, gave up seven runs and 11 hits in three innings.	He pitched 6 1/3 innings in a 6-0 win against Los Angeles on April 25 at Seattle. But this one was much different.	Less than 24 hours after the Angels cruised to a 12-0 victory for their most lopsided shutout win ever against Seattle, Maurer retired only three of his first 15 batters and trailed 6-0 after 47 pitches.	Los Angeles scored five in the first on Hamilton's two-run single, Alberto Callaspo's two-run double and an RBI single by Hank Conger. It could have been worse for Maurer, but Erick Aybar was thrown out trying to steal second after drawing a leadoff walk.	"He's learning so much and he's going through what every young pitcher has to go through," manager Eric Wedge said. "He's going to be a heck of a big league pitcher once he figures all this out. Once he learns from it, he'll be better physically, fundamentally, mentally and emotionally, and all those things will settle in for him."	Mike Trout, coming off his first career cycle, tripled in the second for his sixth consecutive hit and scored on a single by Albert Pujols. Last season's AL Rookie of the Year and AL MVP runner-up is batting .359 with seven homers and 22 RBIs in his last 21 games since going 1 for 8 in a 19-inning loss at Oakland on April 29.	Aybar made it 7-0 with an RBI single in the third. It would be the last Angels hit until Trumbo's one-out double in the seventh against Yoervis Medina. The Mariners finally got on the board in the eighth when Brendan Ryan scored on a groundout by Michael Saunders.	"There's no panic. I mean, panic's not in my vocabulary, and it better not be in theirs," Wedge said. "The coolest cat wins. We're two series removed from winning five out of six series -- and even then we didn't feel like we were the ballclub we feel like could still be. So it's all right there for us. We just have to go out and take it."	Game notes	Mariners 1B-DH Kendrys Morales, whom the Angels traded away last December for LHP Jason Vargas, got his 500th career hit in the first inning on a single through the box and finished the day 3 for 4 with a double. ... Trout has seven hits in his last 16 at-bats, but has struck out looking seven times during that stretch. ... Weaver (broken bone in his non-pitching arm) took park in an extended spring training game at the team's Tempe, Ariz., complex. He threw 62 of his 75 pitches for strikes, allowing a run and six hits in 5 2/3 innings with nine strikeouts and no walks.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CLEVELAND -- Justin Verlander wasn't about to let a win slip away in the rain.	Verlander returned to the mound after sitting through a 62-minute rain delay to get his fifth win and Miguel Cabrera hit another homer -- maybe the luckiest of his career -- as the Detroit Tigers beat the Cleveland Indians 11-7 on Wednesday night, sweeping the two-game series between the AL Central's top teams.	Verlander (5-4) was two outs from qualifying for a victory when the game was stopped with the Tigers leading 9-5 in the fifth. The right-hander came back after the weather break and finished the inning to get the win, ending a run of five straight victories by the Indians over former Cy Young winners.	Tigers manager Jim Leyland said his general rule is not let a pitcher return after sitting more than an hour. However, he made an exception because it was so close, and because Verlander is Verlander.	"Since I've been here, he's been our horse," Leyland. "He has earned that right. I thought he deserved it."	After the long delay in the fifth, the game was stopped for another 48 minutes in the eighth.	Victor Martinez hit two sacrifice flies off Ubaldo Jimenez (3-3) as the Tigers, who led 9-2 in the fifth, held on to move within one-half game of the first-place Indians.	After the second rain delay, Cabrera connected for a two-run homer off reliever Rich Hill.	It was the slugger's fifth homer in three games and 13th this season. The shot to right-center was helped over the wall by center fielder Michael Bourn, who ran back to the warning track and was in position to make the catch but had the ball bounce out of his glove and into the stands.	"It was a lucky home run," Cabrera said. "I was surprised. That's never happened to me."	Carlos Santana hit a two-run homer and Yan Gomes connected for the Indians, who will open a four-game series in Boston on Thursday -- manager Terry Francona's return to Fenway Park for the first time since leaving the Red Sox.	Down 9-2 after three, the Indians fought back within two runs but lost some momentum because of the delays.	"Every time we would get something going, the rain would come and kind of kill things," third baseman Mark Reynolds said. "It is what it is. There's nothing you can do about Mother Nature."	Verlander wasn't sharp for the third straight outing, allowing five runs and 10 hits. He walked one and struck out nine, but the five-time All-Star wasn't about to let a win slip away because of the weather.	While the grounds crew hauled out the tarp to cover the field in the fifth, Verlander stood on the mound and gave an incredulous look to umpire Tim Welke, the crew chief working second base. Verlander was aware a possible victory was being washed away since he would likely not be coming back after the delay.	As the tarp was still being rolled up nearly an hour later, Verlander went back out to warm up without his teammates and stayed in the game despite a lengthy wait between his 100th and 101st pitches.	Verlander knew during the stoppage that Leyland might not be willing to let him resume pitching.	"I was very much paying attention to the clock," he said. "I was kind of lobbying to Jim during the rain delay. If it was five minutes more, I was done."	When play resumed, he retired Reynolds on a grounder to third and struck out Ryan Raburn looking.	Verlander took a seven-run lead into the fifth, but was touched up for three runs on Michael Brantley's RBI single and Santana's homer, his eighth.	Verlander may be one of the AL's most dominant pitchers, but the 2011 Cy Young Award winner has only been average against the Indians. He came in 14-14 in 31 career starts against Cleveland, which had already beaten him once this year.	The Indians had Verlander on the ropes in the second, but couldn't come up with the big hit. Verlander gave up just one run and worked out of a two-out, bases-loaded situation by getting Brantley on a force.	The next time he took the mound, Verlander had a four-run cushion as the Tigers took advantage of two walks to score four runs in the third and take a 6-2 lead.	Jimenez, who allowed six runs in four innings, walked Torii Hunter with one out and then threw four consecutive balls to the dangerous Cabrera. Prince Fielder hit a ground-rule RBI double, and Martinez delivered his second sac fly to make it 4-2. Jhonny Peralta and Brayan Pena continued the onslaught against Jimenez with run-scoring doubles.	The Tigers didn't waste any time, scoring two runs in the first off Jimenez, who had pitched as well in his past four starts as in any stretch since joining the Indians in 2011.	Game notes	Francona said 1B Nick Swisher will rejoin the Indians in time for Friday's game in Boston. Swisher was placed on the paternity list Wednesday after his wife, JoAnna, had the couple's first child, a girl. ... The Tigers and Indians next meet on June 7-9 in Detroit. ... Cabrera is batting .466 (14 of 30) during an eight-game hitting streak. ... Leyland rested starting C Alex Avila, who is batting just .174 and mired in a 1-for-21 slump. Leyland doesn't know what's wrong with Avila. "I wish I did," he said. "I don't want to indicate that Alex isn't our catcher because he is, but at some point I have to do something -- sit him down or go every other day for a while. I don't really have the formula just yet in my mind."	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

PITTSBURGH -- Francisco Liriano's fastball is going where he wants it to. The Pittsburgh Pirates are following suit.	The veteran left-hander continued his torrid start, scattering two hits over seven innings and the Pirates edged the Chicago Cubs 1-0 on Wednesday night.	Liriano (3-0) struck out nine and walked just one to remain unbeaten since making his season debut against the New York Mets two weeks ago.	"What was it, one walk, nine punchouts and two hits?" Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said. "Man, that's clean stuff."	You won't find the Cubs arguing after Liriano escaped a bases-loaded, no-out jam in the third inning unscathed and then cruised. The Cubs went 0-for-6 with runners in scoring position and are hitting just .160 (4-for-25) with runners on base during their three-game losing streak.	"It's the same old song and dance," Chicago manager Dale Sveum said. "We get people on but can't get them in."	Mark Melancon survived a bumpy ninth inning for his first save of the season. The Pirates were forced to sit closer Jason Grilli -- whose 18 saves lead the majors -- after he labored through 34 pitches in a 5-4 win on Tuesday.	The road to Melancon's first save since Aug. 26, 2012, while pitching for Boston wasn't exactly smooth.	The Cubs put runners on first and second with one out but couldn't tie things up. Melancon, who has served as the primary setup man this season, didn't feel any extra jitters getting the last three outs.	"I do it every night, it's just in the eighth inning instead of the ninth," Melancon said.	Andrew McCutchen doubled twice for the Pirates and scored the game's only run on an RBI single by Garrett Jones in the first. Pittsburgh has won 10 of 12 to move 10 games above .500 (28-18). The Pirates have also won six straight one-run games.	"I love the way we're going about our business," Hurdle said.	Chicago's Jeff Samardzija (2-6) nearly matched Liriano pitch for pitch, giving up just three hits in seven innings, but received little help once again.	The Cubs have scored just 10 runs in Samardzija's losses. The right-hander's only issue came in the first when McCutchen doubled with two outs then scored on a single by Jones.	It would be all the cushion the Pirates needed while Samardzija lost a 1-0 decision for the second time in a month.	"You take it with a grain of salt," said Samardzija, who walked one and struck out eight. "That's just the way the game goes sometimes. You give up five runs and get a win sometimes."	Or, in the case of the Pirates, whenever Liriano is on the mound.	The Pirates agreed to terms with the former All-Star in December, but Liriano signed a more incentive-laden deal after breaking his right (non-throwing) arm in a freak accident on Christmas Day.	It's certainly looking like a bargain now. The left-hander has spent most of the five seasons attempting to regain the form he showed as a 22-year-old phenom with the Minnesota Twins in 2006, when he went 12-3 with a 2.16 ERA and made the All-Star team on his way to finishing third in American League Rookie of the Year voting.	His path to stardom was sidetracked by Tommy John surgery in 2007, though he appears to have found a home in Pittsburgh.	Mixing his offspeed stuff with a rejuvenated fastball refined by a tweak to his delivery, Liriano has joined A.J. Burnett and Wandy Rodriguez in giving the Pirates a respectable top of the rotation.	"I think I work hard in the offseason, location-wise with my fastball and everything is working so far," Liriano said. "Pitching is all about location so when you can locate your pitches, you have better results."	He was solid in his first two starts in wins over the Mets and Milwaukee. He was spectacular at times against the Cubs. He retired 14 of 15 batters at one point and managed to expertly wiggle out of the lone spot of trouble in the third when the Cubs loaded the bases with no outs following a Cody Ransom single, a walk and an error.	In a way, Liriano had the Cubs right where he wanted them.	Chicago began the night hitting just .218 with runners in scoring position, the second-lowest in the majors.	The number dropped a bit more after Julio Borbon hit into a fielders' choice, Starlin Castro struck out and Anthony Rizzo flew out to right to end the threat.	No Cub made it to third base over Liriano's final four innings and Pittsburgh's bullpen made it hold up. The Pirates are 21-1 when leading after seven innings this season.	Tony Watson worked the eighth and the Cubs made Melancon work in the ninth.	Alfonso Soriano reached on strikeout-wild pitch and Wellington Castillo singled with one out. Nate Schierholtz and Darwin Barney both lofted weak fly balls to shallow right field that Pittsburgh second baseman Neil Walker corralled with ease.	Game notes	Chicago's Darwin Barney, who went 4 for 4 in the series opener on Tuesday to raise his average from .192 to .223, went 0 for 3 ... Pittsburgh's left-handed starters are 8-1 at PNC Park this season ... The series wraps up on Thursday. Jeanmar Gomez (2-0, 2.78 ERA) will make his first start against the Cubs. Edwin Jackson (1-6 5.76) starts for Chicago. Jackson is 4-1 with a 3.09 ERA against the Pirates in his career.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

MIAMI -- Once Cliff Lee escaped an early jam, the rest seemed to come easily.	Lee pitched a three-hitter for his 12th career shutout and Delmon Young homered for the second straight game, sending the Philadelphia Phillies past the Miami Marlins 3-0 on Wednesday night.	Lee (5-2) struck out five, walked two and hit a batter in his first shutout since Sept. 5, 2011.	"I know I got lucky early in the game with the bases loaded and nobody out, getting the double play there," Lee said. "I felt like I got better as the game went on, too."	The Marlins failed to score despite that threat in the second inning. Nick Green grounded into a third-to-home-to-first double play and Jeff Mathis popped up.	"I was willing to sacrifice a run right there for two outs," Lee said. "Luckily, he hit it to third base where we could get the guy at home and then throw to first, so that was huge."	Lee has allowed three or less runs in eight of his 10 starts. Miami's only hits were Marcell Ozuna's infield single leading off the second, Miguel Olivo's lined single opening the sixth and Derek Dietrich's infield single in the ninth.	The Marlins were blanked for the ninth time this season.	"We had that one opportunity to score and didn't get it done and that was about it," Miami manager Mike Redmond said.	Lee also got two hits.	"It's the funnest part of the game for me," he said. "Anytime I can do anything to help the team win, I try to take it serious."	Young hit a solo home run off Kevin Slowey (1-5) in the fourth. It was Young's third homer, including a drive off Miami's Jose Fernandez on Tuesday night.	"I feel like I'm ready in time and I'm able to recognize the pitch early," Young said.	Slowey exited before the sixth inning with a strained left lat muscle. The Marlins said he was day to day.	Slowey allowed six hits and struck out six.	Philadelphia scored twice off Wade LeBlanc with two outs in the sixth to go ahead 3-0.	Young reached on a two-out infield hit and scored on Domonic Brown's triple. Freddy Galvis singled home Brown.	In the fifth, Chris Coghlan walked but was thrown out at second as he tried to advance when Green flied out to deep right. Young threw to shortstop Jimmy Rollins, who applied the tag as Coghlan slid in headfirst.	Game notes	After the game, the Phillies announced RHP Phillippe Aumont was being sent to Triple-A Lehigh Valley. Philadelphia will add a player on Friday to take Aumont's spot. ... Philadelphia 2B Chase Utley is scheduled for an MRI on Thursday on his sore	ribcage. He was scratched from the lineup for Philadelphia's 7-3 win on Tuesday night after feeling discomfort during batting practice. ... Miami RF Giancarlo Stanton (strained hamstring) took swings on the field during batting practice for the first time since going on the disabled list April 30. He hopes to begin running next week. ... The Phillies (23-24) have not been at .500 since being 6-6 on April 14.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CHICAGO -- Clay Buchholz figures a slump will come his way at some point so he'll enjoy this run while it lasts.	Buchholz pitched five-hit ball over seven innings to improve to 7-0, and the Boston Red Sox beat the Chicago White Sox 6-2 Wednesday night to avoid a three-game sweep.	David Ortiz delivered a two-run single in the first off Hector Santiago (1-3) and stole third for the first time in his career. Jacoby Ellsbury had two hits, walked twice and made a big catch in center field to back Buchholz and help the Red Sox come away with their sixth win in eight games.	They're now 9-1 with Buchholz starting, and he has gone at least six innings each time out.	"You're going to take your lumps and bumps in the road," he said.	But it has been a smooth ride so far for him, although he got some help from his defense in this one.	Jonny Gomes made a sliding catch on Paul Konerko's line drive to left with two on to end the first, and Ellsbury raced to the center-field warning track to snag Alexei Ramirez's liner with a runner on and two out in the fifth to preserve a 2-1 lead.	Boston added to it in the eighth when Will Middlebrooks hit a sacrifice fly to right off Nate Jones after the Red Sox loaded the bases against Brian Omogrosso in the eighth, and Mike Napoli scored on a passed ball by Tyler Flowers to make it 4-1. The Red Sox scored two more in the ninth to put this one away.	Even so, Konerko was feeling pretty good about how the White Sox played in this series.	"It's good for our record, but I think it should be good for our confidence that we belong on the same field as some of these teams," he said. "I don't think we doubt that anyway, but it reinforces it."	Buchholz allowed just one run while lowering his American League-leading ERA to 1.73. He also matched the best start by a Boston pitcher since Josh Beckett in 2007 and joined Tampa Bay's Matt Moore and Arizona's Patrick Corbin as the only unbeaten pitchers in the majors with seven or more wins.	"I thought tonight, still, he had very good stuff," Red Sox manager John Farrell said. "He's still pitching in the low to mid-90s with his fastball. The biggest thing is you never can sit on any one pitch in any given count."	The only run Buchholz allowed came on an RBI groundout in the third by Alex Rios, who extended his career-high hitting streak to 17 with a single in the sixth.	The White Sox also got a solo homer from Konerko off Andrew Bailey. Otherwise, the White Sox couldn't get the big hit. They were 0-for-5 with runners in scoring position after doing all their scoring with two outs while winning the previous two games 6-4 and 3-1.	Santiago wasn't quite as dominant after Jose Quintana took a no-hitter into the seventh the previous night, but he gave the White Sox exactly what they needed.	He settled down after the shaky start and threw six solid innings for the White Sox with Chris Sale scratched because of mild tendinitis in his left shoulder. The left-hander allowed two runs and three hits, struck out nine and walked four pitching on three days' rest in what might be his last start for a while.	That's because he or Dylan Axelrod could be headed to the bullpen with John Danks expected to return from his shoulder injury.	"It's tough, but that's part of being in baseball," White Sox manager Robin Ventura said. "We have to figure out what's best for us, so we'll figure that out on Friday."	Game notes	Ortiz was having some fun after the game in light of his steal of third in the first inning. Asked if he's the new Rickey Henderson, he said, "So they say." And when he saw the steal sign, he said, "I was like, 'You sure?'" ... The Red Sox held OF Shane Victorino out of the lineup for the second straight game because of tightness in his left hamstring. Manager John Farrell said there has been improvement and is hopeful he won't have to go on the disabled list. ... Farrell said backup C David Ross (concussion) will go on a rehab assignment Thursday at Double-A Portland. ... The White Sox said after the game that Danks will be activated from the disabled list and make his first start of the year against Miami on Friday. Danks is coming off a season-ending shoulder injury and his not pitched since May 19, 2012. He had surgery in August to repair a capsule tear and remove debris in his rotator cuff and biceps. To make room for Danks, the White Sox optioned left-hander Donnie Veal to Triple-A Charlotte after Wednesday's game.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

HOUSTON -- The Houston Astros got another good outing from their starting pitcher, and their bullpen was just fine for a change.	J.D. Martinez hit a two-run homer off James Shields, Jordan Lyles pitched six effective innings and the Astros beat the Kansas City Royals 3-1 on Wednesday night.	Lyles (2-1) allowed one run and six hits in his 50th career game. Travis Blackley and Hector Ambriz each got three outs before Jose Veras pitched a perfect ninth for his eighth save one night after the bullpen struggled in a 7-3 loss.	"They've been taxed a lot this year and called upon on numerous occasions, so every once in a while you're going to have the kind of game that we had last night," manager Bo Porter said. "But again, it speaks to the character of the men down there. They hold themselves accountable to holding a lead, and tonight they did a tremendous job. All of them."	Bud Norris pitched six shutout innings Tuesday, but the Royals scored seven times in the final three innings. Houston bounced back quite nicely to take two of three for its fourth series win this season.	Shields (2-5) struck out seven in seven innings while yielding two runs and seven hits. He has gone seven or more innings in each of his last six starts, but hasn't won since April 30 due in part to his offense providing him with just five runs combined in his last four starts.	"It's a little frustrating," manager Ned Yost said. "Especially when James Shields goes out and gives you the type of performance he gives you about every time he goes out. We just have not done a good job with run support with him at all."	Shields is confident it will turn around soon.	"These guys are great. They are grinding every day," Shields said. "We are going through a little struggle right now. Our heads are high, and we are staying positive. It is a long season. By no means are we out of it."	The right-hander, who was acquired in an offseason trade with Tampa Bay, retired his first two batters before running into trouble. Jason Castro singled before Martinez drove a 2-2 pitch into the seats in right for his fourth homer.	"We were able to get him right away, first inning which is huge and it gives Lyles a little bit of comfort as well," Martinez said. "Pitchers like that ... good guys, you've got to get them early before they settle in."	Castro tacked on an RBI single in the eighth inning against Kelvin Herrera.	Houston's Jimmy Paredes got his first start of the season at third base in place of Matt Dominguez, who sat out with tightness in his left quadriceps. Paredes has struggled in the outfield in the last few games, causing two collisions, but was solid at third.	Alcides Escobar smoked a grounder to Paredes with one out in the eighth, and he made a perfect throw to first to get him out.	"I don't know how hard he threw that ball across the diamond, but I would love to put a clock on it though," Porter said of the play. "He almost mishandled it and he got control of it and it was absolutely whistled across the diamond. He looked comfortable over there."	Kansas City got its only run in the third when Jeff Francoeur hit a leadoff triple to the hill in center and George Kottaras followed with an RBI double. Alex Gordon walked with two down, but Lyles struck out Billy Butler to end the inning.	Lyles also got Gordon to bounce out with two runners on to end the fifth.	Castro, the catcher, was impressed with Lyles' work.	"That's the best I've seen him throw in a long time," Castro said. "He had command, didn't miss. When we were trying to go certain locations, he missed where we were trying to go. He didn't leave really anything over the plate for guys to hit and that's big when you can do that."	After their two-run first inning, the Astros had trouble stringing together hits against Shields. Martinez singled to start the fourth, but was thrown out trying to stretch it into a double. Chris Carter followed with a single, and Shields retired the next two batters to end the inning.	Gordon singled in the first inning to extend his hitting streak to 10 games.	Game notes	Houston is off on Thursday. ... The Royals return home to open a four-game series with the Angels. ... Kansas City C Salvador Perez was out of the lineup for the second straight game after bruising his right hip after crashing into the railing chasing a foul ball on Monday. He said he has a gigantic bruise on his hip, but is OK and that he could have played on Tuesday. He is day to day. ... Dominguez is expected to be back in the lineup on Friday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

SAN DIEGO -- Tyler Lyons scrolled through his phone, scanning all the text messages congratulating the left-hander on his winning major league debut. His teammates were quite appreciative, too.	Lyons pitched seven solid innings on the same day St. Louis lost Jaime Garcia for the season, and the Cardinals beat the San Diego Padres 5-3 on Wednesday night.	"It was everything I could ask for," said Lyons, who also got his first major league hit on a single in the sixth. "I pitched well, I got a hit and we won the ballgame. It doesn't get much better than that."	Lyons, who was promoted from Triple-A Memphis after Garcia went on the disabled list, used an effective sinker to limit the Padres to one run and four hits. The 25-year-old Lyons was a ninth-round draft pick in 2010 out of Oklahoma State.	The Cardinals announced before that game that Garcia will have season-ending shoulder surgery this week. The lefty went 5-2 with a 3.58 ERA in nine starts this year, helping St. Louis bolt to the majors' best record at 30-16.	Yadier Molina had four hits and Carlos Beltran finished with three as the Cardinals took two of three from the Padres.	Lyons continued a positive trend this season for St. Louis, which has used six rookie starting pitchers already. Lyons is the second lefty to get a win in his major league debut in the last nine days. The other is John Gast, who beat the New York Mets on May 14.	"It's been of great benefit to get solid outings out of some young pitchers," manager Mike Matheny said. "These guys have come into some tough situations and performed admirably.	"We're proud of how the guys are going about their business despite instances that could be described as adversity. They play hard every day and they put a lot of faith in each other and the next man up."	While Lyons pitched well, San Diego rookie Burch Smith failed to record an out in the second inning for the second time in three major league starts. He was optioned to Triple-A Tucson after the game.	The right-hander struggled with his command, walking three before he was lifted with no outs in the second. Tim Stauffer came in and got Matt Holliday to hit into a double play, but Matt Carpenter scored to give the Cardinals a 4-0 lead.	Smith allowed five hits and has given up 15 runs and 16 hits in just 7 1/3 innings. The Padres will make a corresponding roster move on Friday at Arizona.	"Burch has excellent stuff, but at times it looked as though he was trying too hard," manager Bud Black said. "He struggled against major league hitters but, in the long run, this guy's going to be fine."	Holliday had an RBI triple in the first that was confirmed by a video review. The ball landed just below the yellow border in right field, but it came down from a difficult angle that prompted Matheny to question whether it was a home run.	Holliday scored on Allen Craig's single, and Daniel Descalso added a run-scoring double.	Molina singled in a run in the fifth but that was the only blemish for Stauffer, who allowed eight hits and struck out seven in 5 2/3 innings.	Stauffer kept San Diego in the game, but the offense never got going.	Rookie Jedd Gyorko got the Padres on the board with a towering home run to center field in the seventh. Gyorko's drive went 438 feet and is the longest at Petco Park this season. He has the three longest Padres home runs this season.	Alexi Amarista added a two-run single in the ninth for San Diego.	Game notes	Cardinals pitcher Jake Westbook, on the 15-day disabled list with right elbow inflammation, cut his bullpen session short after experiencing pain in his injured elbow. He will be evaluated further on Thursday, an off day for the club. ... Cardinals 3B David Freese, who has missed three games after lacerating his hand on Sunday, will have stitches removed on Friday and is expected to be available for that night's game against the Los Angeles Dodgers. ... San Diego Padres LF Carlos Quentin missed his second straight game with left knee soreness. ... Padres OF Cameron Maybin, on the 15-day DL with a wrist injury, will start a minor league rehab assignment with Tucson on Friday. ... Padres INF Logan Forsythe, on the 60-day disabled list with plantar fasciitis, will play extended spring training games starting Friday. He will begin as a designated hitter.

PITTSBURGH --  It was hard to tell whether the Pittsburgh Pirates were heading on a road trip or getting ready for a Stanley Cup playoff game after beating the Chicago Cubs 4-2 on Thursday for their fourth straight win.	All of the Pirates' players and coaches wore Pittsburgh Penguins' replica jerseys as they got ready to embark on a road trip to Milwaukee and Detroit. The Penguins even sent a custom-made No. 13 sweater to manager Clint Hurdle.	The Penguins lead the Ottawa Senators 3-1 in their best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinal.	"There's nothing much like playoff hockey," Hurdle said. "We're just getting into the spirit."	Utility infielder Brandon Inge took things one step farther before the game, arriving in the Pirates' clubhouse dressed in a full hockey uniform and rollerblades.	"It's something fun, something to change things up a little bit during a long season. Plus, we've got to support our boys," said Pirates second baseman Neil Walker, a Pittsburgh-area native.	The Pirates won for the 11th time in 13 games as Andrew McCutchen had three hits and two RBIs.	Leadoff hitter Starling Marte singled and scored in each of the first two innings as Pittsburgh built an early 4-0 lead. The Pirates moved a season-best 11 games over .500.	"We're playing good baseball and I don't think we've reached our ceiling yet," McCutchen said. "The pitching has been good all year but the hitting has kind of been up and down. The bats are eventually going to come around and we should be even better when that happens."	The Cubs lost their fourth in a row.	Edwin Jackson (1-7) gave up two runs in the first inning and two more in the second. He gave up six hits and struck out six in three innings and has a 6.11 ERA through 10 starts.	"I got beat with men on base with balls up in the zone," Jackson said. "I had some times when I got it down but in vital situations when I needed to keep the ball down I wasn't doing that, and that pretty much sums up the game."	Jackson is in his first season with the Cubs after signing a four-year, $52 million contract over the winter as a free agent.	"I think at times he tries too hard to justify his contract and overthrows," Chicago manager Dale Sveum said. "I think he needs to relax and just be Edwin Jackson, the guy we liked enough to sign."	Reliever Vin Mazzaro (3-0) pitched 2 1/3 scoreless innings. He replaced starter Jeanmar Gomez in the fourth inning following a rain delay of 1 hour, 47 minutes.	"I knew about a half-hour before the delay ended that I was going to come in to pitch, but you never know how the long the delay might last, so I tried to stay as prepared as possible," Mazzaro said. "I felt like I was ready to go."	Gomez allowed one run and three hits in 3 2/3 innings.	"I thought I had really good stuff today and control of all my pitches," Gomez said. "Then it started raining hard and that was it. I think I could have pitched a lot longer but I'm frustrated about it. You can't do anything about the rain."	Jason Grilli pitched a 1-2-3 ninth inning and is a perfect 19-for-19 in save opportunities.	Marte led off the bottom of the first inning with a single, stole second with one out and scored on McCutchen's single. McCutchen stole second and scored on Michael McKenry's single.	Marte singled in the second and scored on Travis Snider's triple that rolled to the 410-foot notch in left-center field. McCutchen added his second RBI single.	The Cubs got a run in the fourth when David DeJesus led off with a double and scored on Anthony Rizzo's grounder. The Cubs had runners on the corners when two outs when play was halted, but Mazzaro got Welington Castillo to hit an inning-ending groundout after the delay.	Chicago cut the deficit to 4-2 in the seventh with Darwin Barney singling in Castillo, who had walked.	Game notes	 Jackson was struck in the rear end by a line drive off the bat of Marte in the second inning. Castro jammed his right ankle while being thrown out trying to stretch a single into a double in the sixth inning by RF Travis Snider. Both Chicago players were able to stay in the game. ... The Cubs' road trip continues Friday night at Cincinnati with RHP Scott Feldman (4-3, 2.19) facing Reds RHP Bronson Arroyo (4-4, 3.28). ... RHP A.J. Burnett (3-4, 2.57) is scheduled to start for Pittsburgh at Milwaukee against RHP Marco Estrada (3-2, 5.44).	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

TORONTO -- With his first major league start in the books, Kevin Gausman was looking forward to a good night's rest.	Edwin Encarnacion hit his fifth career grand slam, J.P. Arencibia homered and drove in four runs and the Toronto Blue Jays beat Baltimore 12-6 on Thursday night, spoiling Gausman's Orioles debut.	"Definitely a learning experience for me but it was awesome," Gausman said. "It was everything I could have imagined and more.	"I've been waiting my entire life for this. I haven't been able to sleep very much lately. That was something that was kind of great to get out of the way. Hopefully, I can sleep tonight."	The fourth overall pick in the 2012 draft, Gausman allowed four runs and seven hits in five innings. The right-hander walked two and struck out five.	"He gave us a chance to win against a team swinging the bat as hot as anybody," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. "I thought he handled himself the way you'd like to see a young pitcher handle himself. He's only going to get better."	The youngest starter in the AL at 22 years and 137 days, Gausman showed some veteran composure in the third, loading the bases with none out before retiring the next three batters.	"His changeup was a big pitch for him tonight and he was able to use it in some key situations," catcher Matt Wieters said. "The slider was there if we needed it, too.	"That's a good hitting team and a good hitting fastball team and he was able to make some balls miss some barrels," Wieters added.	Even Blue Jays manager John Gibbons was impressed.	"He's got a great arm," Gibbons said. "He pitched with good composure. He looks like he belongs out there. For a debut he did a heck of a job."	Promoted from Double-A Bowie to face Toronto, Gausman learned that big league hitters are a cut above the opponents he's been facing.	"I threw a great changeup 3-2 to (Colby) Rasmus and he just kind of spit on it," Gausman said. "At this level, those guys are so good it's kind of crazy."	Gausman (0-1) is the 11th pitcher to start for Baltimore this year. The Orioles used 12 starters all of last season.	Baltimore's Chris Davis hit his major league leading 15th home run, a leadoff shot in the fourth. Nick Markakis and Adam Jones hit back-to-back homers off Brandon Morrow to start the eighth but it wasn't enough for the Orioles, who lost for the seventh time in nine games.	Baltimore's Manny Machado went 3-for-4 with three doubles, boosting his major league-leading total to 21.	Morrow (2-3) allowed six runs and a season-high 10 hits in seven-plus innings. He walked one and struck out five.	"It's frustrating for me to go out give up the two home runs without getting an out there in the eighth," Morrow said. "It's a good win, but it put a sour taste in my mouth."	Brett Cecil and Brad Lincoln each worked one inning of scoreless relief as Toronto won for the third time in four games.	Machado gave the Orioles an early lead with a two-run double in the third. Davis made it 3-0 by homering on Morrow's first pitch of the fourth, but the Blue Jays rallied with two runs off Gausman in the bottom half. Adam Lind and Arencibia led off with consecutive doubles and Emilio Bonifacio hit a sacrifice fly.	Arencibia put the Blue Jays in front with a two-out, first-pitch drive in the fifth for his 11th homer.	Troy Patton was replaced after issuing back-to-back two-out walks in the sixth. Pedro Strop came on and walked Jose Bautista before Encarnacion homered off the left field foul screen, Toronto's first grand slam this season.	Five of the eight walks issued by Baltimore pitchers came around to score.	"You like your chances when you score six but not when you walk that many people," Showalter said.	After Alexi Casilla hit a sacrifice fly in the seventh, Markakis hit his fifth home run in the eighth and Jones followed with his seventh. It's the third time this season the Orioles have hit consecutive homers.	Toronto put it away with four runs off T.J. McFarland in a bat-around eighth. Anthony Gose scored from second on a passed ball after Wieters threw to second, Arencibia hit an RBI grounder, Brett Lawrie singled home a run and Rasmus hit a sacrifice fly.	Left fielder Nate McLouth tumbled into the stands after running into the wall in foul territory while retiring Rasmus for the first out of the sixth. Fans tried to indicate that McLouth had dropped the ball, but third base umpire Manny Gonzalez ruled it an out. After the play, a fan in the second deck threw a drink at McLouth, bringing Showalter out for a discussion with the umpires.	Both Showalter and McLouth downplayed the incident.	"It just kind of startled me for a second," McLouth said. "I'm not really sure how close it landed. That's just one person doing something they shouldn't do."	Game notes	The Blue Jays are 15-0 when scoring five runs or more. ... Jones, who has been bothered by a sore groin, made his third straight start at DH. Jones played 162 games last year and has yet to miss a game this season. ...Toronto will promote LHP Sean Nolin from Double-A to make his major league debut Friday against the Orioles. RHP Chad Jenkins will start Sunday. ... To clear a roster spot for Gausman, the Orioles optioned RHP Jake Arrieta to Triple-A Norfolk and designated RHP Alex Burnett for assignment. ... A moment of silence was held before the game in memory of scout Epy Guerrero, who died Thursday at 71. ... Former Blue Jays infielder Homer Bush threw out the first pitch. ... Showalter celebrated his 57th birthday.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

DETROIT -- Jim Leyland is usually pretty confident about his managerial moves.	Thursday, though, he wasn't entirely sure if he had done something smart or stupid.	With the game tied in the eighth, Omar Infante started the inning with a single, and Leyland decided to have Torii Hunter bunt him to second.	That put the go-ahead run in scoring position, but meant taking the bat out of the hands of Miguel Cabrera, baseball's hottest hitter.	"That was a tough call," Leyland acknowledged after the game. "That's definitely a move that the fans are going to discuss, and I don't have any problem with that. I wasn't sure, either."	Sure enough, Minnesota manager Ron Gardenhire immediately signaled for the intentional walk. The reason Leyland took the chance? Prince Fielder was coming up next, and facing right-hander Jared Burton.	"If they had a tough lefty to pitch to Prince -- maybe Glen Perkins if it had been the ninth inning -- I might not have bunted," Leyland said. "Prince has 40 RBIs hitting behind Miguel Cabrera, so I was willing to roll the dice with him."	The plan worked, but only barely. Fielder hit what looked like a possible double-play grounder, but it deflected off Burton's glove and past second baseman Brian Dozier. Infante scored easily, and the Tigers held on to win 7-6.	"You hate walking anyone to pitch to Prince Fielder, I can tell you that right now," Gardenhire said. "But you've got to take your choice, and the way Cabrera is swinging the bat, you've got to do it. We got the groundball. It just didn't work out."	Before the intentional walk, Cabrera had driven in three runs, including his sixth homer in four games. He's matched a career high by homering in four straight games. He has also walked five times in the four games, and Fielder has followed all five with hits, driving in seven more runs. In the four games, the pair have combined to drive in 20 runs.	"It's absolutely incredible what they are doing," Tigers starter Rick Porcello said. "If I were pitching against them, I'd just walk both of them every time they came up."	Joaquin Benoit (1-0) picked up the win with a perfect inning of relief, while Jose Valverde pitched the ninth for his fifth save.	The Tigers trailed 6-3 going into the bottom of the seventh, but scored three times off three Minnesota pitchers. Infante singled and Cabrera walked with one out, bringing Brian Duensing into the game. He allowed RBI singles to Prince Fielder and Victor Martinez before giving way to Burton.	Jhonny Peralta greeted Burton (0-2) with a game-tying double, and Matt Tuiasosopo was hit by a pitch to load the bases before Brayan Pena and Andy Dirks popped out to end the inning.	"We gave the game over to our bullpen, and they usually do the job," Gardenhire said. "Just didn't happen today."	The Tigers had taken a 2-0 lead in the first when Cabrera lifted a 2-2 pitch into the bullpens beyond the left-field fence. It was the first of his six homers in four games that he had pulled -- the others had all been to center field or right-center.	Porcello almost got a second straight inning-ending double play in the second, but Jhonny Peralta juggled Dozier's grounder and Dozier beat the relay throw to allow Justin Morneau to score.	Minnesota started the third with three straight singles, tying the game, and Josh Willingham made it 5-2 by pulling Porcello's pitch deep into the left-field stands.	Scott Diamond retired 10 straight batters after Tuiasosopo's second-inning single, but Detroit loaded the bases with two out in the fifth on two singles and a walk. Cabrera bounced an infield single up the middle, making it 5-3, but Diamond got Fielder to pop out and end the inning.	Detroit threatened again in the sixth, putting runners on second and third with two out, but Fien came on to strike out pinch-hitter Andy Dirks. Willingham then moved the lead to three runs with a solo homer off Darin Downs in the seventh.	"That's a tough loss," Willingham said. "I felt good at the plate, and I was able to get the pitchers to elevate the ball. That's the key to doing what I do."	Game notes	The start of the game was delayed for an hour by rain. ... Twins shortstop Pedro Florimon left the game after the top of the third with an sprained right index finger. Florimon appeared to sustain the injury while sliding head-first into third base. Gardenhire said after the game that Florimon is day-to-day. ... The fans broke into a chant of "Let's Go Red Wings" in the top of the fifth inning as news spread that Detroit had taken a 1-0 lead over the Blackhawks in the second period of the playoff game. The hockey game was played at Joe Louis Arena, about five minutes from Comerica Park. ... Cabrera also homered in four straight games with the Marlins in April 2004.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

BOSTON -- Terry Francona returned to Fenway Park and found some more pleasant memories.	A standing ovation. A video tribute to his time as manager of the Boston Red Sox. And, most importantly, a win for his Cleveland Indians.	Drew Stubbs, Mark Reynolds and Michael Bourn combined for nine hits and eight RBIs and the Indians had 16 hits in their 12-3 win on Thursday night.	"I tried to keep my emotions inside," said Francona, who led the Red Sox to two World Series championships in eight years. "I didn't want to be the main focus. You want to let the players play."	Francona, let go by Boston after the 2011 season, got the ovation after the first inning during a video display on the center-field scoreboard. He raised his left hand to the crowd and tapped his heart with his right.	"I was honored," he said.	And, perhaps, just a bit emotional.	"It was just neat to see the organization do that for him," Reynolds said. "I think I saw him teary-eyed a little bit during that thing. It was pretty neat and I was glad to be a part of it."	It was the fans' only chance to cheer for Francona. He didn't bring out the lineup card and didn't have to leave the visiting dugout during the game because all of Cleveland's pitching changes came at the start of an inning.	He had left Boston as the second winningest manager, behind Joe Cronin, in club history.	In his first year as Cleveland's manager, he has the Indians in first place in the AL Central after they went 68-94 last season.	They're 22-9 in their last 31 games.	"They've got a good team and are in first place for a reason, not by accident," said Boston manager John Farrell, Francona's former pitching coach with the Red Sox.	The 12 runs are the most scored by the Indians in the park since June 28, 2005 and the most they scored there without a home run since 1953.	"Homers (have) been known to be rally killers," Reynolds said. "You keep having guys on base, it keeps the pressure on the pitcher and it makes him be precise."	Zach McAllister (4-3) allowed three runs in five innings. He hasn't allowed more than three earned runs in any of his nine starts this year. Scott Barnes earned his first major-league save by pitching three shutout innings.	"I think everyone wanted to go out there and get a win, not just for the team but for (Francona) also," McAllister said. "He's been great for us this year and he's well liked everywhere he is. It's definitely exciting to get him a win."	Ryan Dempster (2-5) gave up four runs in three innings with four walks in his third straight poor start for Boston.	"My command has been terrible," he said. "I have walked 10 guys in the last nine innings. Bottom line is I've got to fix that. I can't get myself in that kind of trouble."	Every Cleveland starting batter had a hit and all except Jason Kipnis scored. Carlos Santana reached base five times with a single and four walks.	The Indians took a 1-0 lead in the first on an RBI double by Stubbs and made it 4-0 in the third, scoring on a two-run single by Reynolds and a force play at second on a grounder by Mike Aviles.	The Red Sox cut that to 4-3 in the third on David Ortiz's eighth homer of the season but wasted a chance for a bigger inning. Jacoby Ellsbury led off with a single and took second on a walk to Daniel Nava. Dustin Pedroia then singled, but Ellsbury was thrown out at the plate by center fielder Bourn. Ortiz then hit the next pitch for his three-run homer.	Run-scoring singles by Asdrubal Cabrera in the fourth and Bourn in the fifth made it 6-3 before the Indians scored six runs when they sent 10 men to the plate in the sixth.	They loaded the bases with no outs on a walk to Cabrera, a single by Michael Brantley and a walk to Santana. Alex Wilson replaced Clayton Mortensen and gave up an RBI single to Reynolds. Yan Gomes followed with a two-run double after first baseman Mike Napoli dropped his foul pop for an error.	Aviles hit an infield pop for the first out, but Stubbs tripled in two runs and Bourn singled in another before Wilson struck out the next two batters.	That was more than enough for Francona to relax the rest of the way with a big lead.	"He's one of the best managers to ever manage here," Boston catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia said. "I wasn't surprised by the (fans') reaction. It is all earned and deserved."	Game notes	Dempster had his shortest start of the season, lasting three innings. His previous shortest came in his prior start, 4 2/3 innings. ... The Indians recalled LHP Barnes from Triple-A Columbus and designated LHP David Huff for assignment. ... Boston 3B Will Middlebrooks left the game in the top of the fifth with lower back spasms. He was called out on strikes on both his at bats before being replaced by Pedro Ciriaco. ... Cleveland's Nick Swisher missed his third straight game while on the paternity list. ... Justin Masterson (7-2) pitches for the Indians against John Lackey (2-4) in the second game of the four-game series on Friday night.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Joe Blanton got some backing from the Angels' bats and bullpen, and finally got his first win of the season.	Mike Trout and Albert Pujols hit solo home runs, and Mark Trumbo hit a two-run shot to help Los Angeles beat the Kansas City Royals 5-4 on Thursday night.	With Jered Weaver set to return to the Angels' rotation, Blanton could have been feeling pressure after going winless in his first nine starts.	"I've been doing it a long time. Why should I feel a sense of urgency now?" Blanton said.	The right-hander held the Royals to seven hits and two runs in 6 1/3 innings. Trumbo put the Angels up 5-2 in the eighth with his team-leading 11th homer before the Royals made it interesting.	"I thought we showed a lot of life at the end of the game," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "We've got a four-game set, and their closer came in and had to throw close to 40 pitches in the first game of the set, and I thought we had a good approach. Any time you can put the tying run at second base and the winning run at first base in the ninth inning, you've done something, especially when you've been down three."	Ervin Santana (3-4), who spent 12 seasons in the Angels' organization before being traded during the offseason to the Royals, struck out eight without a walk, but allowed five runs and eight hits -- four of which were homers. Chris Iannetta hit one in the fifth.	The Royals scored on groundouts by Alex Gordon and Mike Moustakas.	Ernesto Frieri gave up two runs in the ninth on three hits and a walk. Perez, who had three hits, and George Kottaras hit RBI singles before Robert Coello was summoned to get the final out. He retired Alcides Escobar on a fly, to strand two runners for first big league save.	"We won," Frieri said. "That's what matters. That's why I'm happy."	The Royals have lost 13 of their past 18 games to fall two games below .500, matching their worst record. They have scored three or fewer runs in 10 of the losses.	Game notes	Santana, who allowed a big league high 39 home runs last season, gave up four home runs for the second time in his career. ... Weaver struck out nine and walked none in 5 2/3 innings Wednesday in an extended spring training game at Arizona, allowing one run and six hits against Diamondbacks minor-leaguers. . The Royals optioned RHP Kelvin Herrera, who had given up eight home runs in 20 1/3 innings, to Triple-A Omaha. The Royals recalled RHP Louis Coleman, who had a 1.04 ERA in 14 relief appearances with Omaha. Coleman worked a scoreless ninth against the Angels. . Perez, who missed the previous two games with a bruised right hip, returned to the lineup. . LF Alex Gordon went 0-for-3 to snap his 10-game hitting streak.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

WASHINGTON --  The Washington Nationals didn't have a close shave, and neither did Davey Johnson.	The 70-year-old manager still looked closer to 80 after the Nationals beat the Philadelphia Phillies 5-2 Friday night, sporting the scraggly beginnings of facial hair he had vowed to keep until his team started hitting.	Five runs weren't enough, even though it was the most the Nationals had scored in a week. There was also a four-run fifth, the first time Washington had put up four or more in an inning in almost a month.	Johnson said he told a couple of his players: "It's getting close to coming off."	Their response: "They said it can't come off yet,"	"My wife, she probably wants me to take it off, I'm sure she does," Johnson said. "But I might leave it on, see if this is not something strange happening here."	The outburst of hitting provided the rare gift of a cushion for Jordan Zimmermann, who became the National League's first eight-game winner as Washington followed a calamitous road trip with a winning start to a homestand.	Zimmermann (8-2), pitching with a stiff neck that limited his control of his fastball, allowed two runs and six hits with no walks over seven innings -- actually raising his ERA to 1.71 -- on an unseasonably chilly and windy night in the nation's capital.	"I kind of cut him a little shorter than I normally would," Johnson said. "He still threw a heck of a ball game."	There was at least a bit of heat from the Nationals' lineup, which entered the game hitting .225, second worst in the majors. Washington had just completed a 10-game West Coast road trip that included a four-game losing streak, the team's sixth shutout loss of the season, Bryce Harper's head-first collision with a wall and a broken hand for Ryan Mattheus after he punched his locker following a rough outing.	Then Johnson arrived at the ballpark Friday saying: "I decided I wouldn't shave until we started hitting."	If Johnson does pull out the razor, Steve Lombardozzi should get due credit. Playing second while Danny Espinosa recovers from a broken wrist, Lombardozzi had three hits, including a two-out, two-run double that capped the rally in the four-run fifth.	"We score on pass balls, groundballs or short fly balls," Johnson said. "We haven't been getting base hits. To score five runs, we've been kind of stuck on none or one or two, so that was a big shot in the arm."	Phillies starter Kyle Kendrick (4-3) had his shortest outing of the season, allowing five runs and eight hits over five innings. He walked four for the second consecutive start, including three consecutive bases on balls that allowed the Nationals to score a run in the second with a sacrifice fly and no hits.	"Command was bad, threw a lot of balls, didn't get ahead in the count," Kendrick said. "Another one of those nights where it was 2-0, just behind the count, and I threw a lot of pitches."	The Phillies missed a chance to pull even in two ways. A win would have put them at .500 for the first time since April 14, and it also would have tied them with the Nationals, who had lost four of five and have been mired in mediocrity while dealing with the expectations of Johnson's preseason proclamation of "World Series or bust."	"Obviously, we've kind of been up and down all year," Kendrick said. "We had a chance to get it back tonight. Had a couple runs there and I couldn't hold it."	Game notes	Rafael Soriano picked up his 14th save. ... Washington's last four-run inning came April 25 against the Cincinnati Reds. ... Headgear on both players when flying when Tyler Moore crashed into Kratz while trying to score on Lombardozzi's single in the fourth inning. Kratz held on to the ball, and Moore was out. ... Both teams are missing star power. The Phillies don't have Roy Halladay (shoulder surgery) and Chase Utley (oblique strain), while the Nationals are making do without Jayson Werth (hamstring) and Espinosa, who learned Friday that he's been playing with a slight fracture in his right wrist and will need a few days of rest, if not more. ... The Nationals plan to bring up INF-OF Jeff Kobernus from Triple-A Syracuse on Saturday and will likely designate RHP Yunesky Maya for assignment. ... Philadelphia recalled INF-OF Michael Martinez and RHP Michael Stutes to replace Utley (disabled list) and RHP Phillippe Aumont (optioned to Triple-A Lehigh Valley). ... Phillies RHP Mike Adams (right back strain) felt fine after a second rehab bullpen session Friday and is expected to be reactivated Sunday. ... Washington LHP Ross Detwiler will throw a full bullpen session Saturday and remains on pace to return to the rotation Tuesday after skipping one start because of back spasms.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

TORONTO -- The Baltimore Orioles are bashing home runs at an impressive rate right now.	Chris Davis hit his major league-leading 16th homer and Baltimore beat the Toronto Blue Jays 10-6 on Friday night.	J.J. Hardy, Danny Valencia and Adam Jones also went deep as the Orioles matched a season high in runs and set a season high with four home runs. Baltimore has hit an ML-best 66 homers this season.	"When we got a ball over the plate it seemed like we didn't miss it," said Baltimore's Nick Markakis, who had three hits and three RBIs.	The Orioles have hit at least three homers in each of the past four games, their first such streak since a five-game run in August 1996.	That year, the Orioles finished with eight double-digit home run hitters and set a baseball record with 257 homers.	While this Baltimore squad might not be on pace to match those lofty marks, there's still plenty of power.	"They didn't miss anything," Toronto manager John Gibbons said.	The teams combined for 33 hits, 16 by Baltimore and 17 by Toronto.	"It was pinball out there tonight," Gibbons said.	Chris Tillman (4-2) allowed three runs and a season-high 10 hits in five innings to win for the fourth time in six starts. He walked none and matched a season high with seven strikeouts.	"The key was Tillman not walking anybody," said Baltimore manager Buck Showalter. "You've got to make them earn it."	The Orioles walked eight batters in Thursday's 12-6 loss.	Brian Matusz got two outs in the sixth, Tommy Hunter pitched 2 1/3 innings and Darren O'Day finished in the ninth.	Toronto lost for the first time this season when scoring five runs or more, falling to 15-1 in those games. The Blue Jays set a dubious franchise record by allowing the first three batters of an inning to reach safely in three consecutive frames, doing so in the first, second and third.	Toronto catcher J.P. Arencibia was the only starter on either side who didn't reach safely via a hit or walk. He went 0 for 5 with three strikeouts.	Melky Cabrera, Brett Lawrie and Adam Lind all hit solo homers for the Blue Jays, but Lawrie and Gibbons were ejected at the end of the third.	Blue Jays left-hander Sean Nolin was hit hard in his major league debut, allowing six runs and seven hits in 1 1/3 innings. Called up from Double-A to face the Orioles, Nolin (0-1) suffered his first loss since Aug. 27, 2011, when he was pitching for Class A Lansing.	"Definitely not the way I envisioned it," a red-eyed Nolin said. "I think I just had too much energy going. I kind of felt like I already threw a few innings, kind of wasted some gas without doing anything."	Gibbons agreed that Nolin didn't seem to have his best stuff.	"It was a tough go for him, no question," Gibbons said. "Arencibia told me everything was kind of flat, flat in the zone."	Optioned back to the minors after the game, Nolin put his team in a hole before recording his first out. After singles by Markakis and Manny Machado, Hardy hit a three-run drive to left, his ninth.	Cabrera got one run back with his first career leadoff homer and second of the season in the bottom half, but the Orioles chased Nolin with three more in the third. A double, a walk and a single loaded the bases for Markakis, who cleared them with a double.	Lawrie led off the bottom of the second with his fifth home run and Colby Rasmus doubled and scored on Emilio Bonifacio's single, but the Orioles added to their lead in the fourth against Ramon Ortiz.	Davis led off with a second deck homer, his third in three games and fourth in five. Two batters later, Valencia hit his first homer, a two-run drive.	Jones made it 10-3 with a leadoff homer off Brad Lincoln in the sixth, but the Blue Jays scored twice against Matusz in the bottom half. Munenori Kawasaki hit an RBI double and scored on Cabrera's single.	Lind cut it to 10-6 with an opposite field homer off Hunter in the seventh, his fourth.	Lawrie was ejected by home plate umpire Dan Bellino after he was called out looking to strand runners at the corners in the third. Lawrie flipped his bat and tossed his helmet and gloves on the ground as he walked up the third base line toward his position, leading to his first ejection this season.	"I didn't do anything," Lawrie said. "I didn't say one word to him, not one, I didn't look at him one time and I'm in trouble for that."	Bellino warned Lawrie about an equipment violation before the ejection, but Lawrie said he didn't hear it over the noise of the crowd. Crew chief Wally Bell said Lawrie was ejected because for throwing his gloves "in a way that wasn't etiquette in baseball."	Gibbons was tossed for the third time when he came out to argue.	"Next time he's got to throw his gloves in the other direction, I guess," Gibbons said.	Game notes	For Machado, it was his fifth straight road game with at least three hits. He's just the second player younger than 21 to do so, joining Hall of Famer Ty Cobb, who did it in 1907, according to information from the Elias Sports Bureau. ... Mark DeRosa replaced Lawrie. ... Orioles pitching prospect Dylan Bundy, who was shut down last month because of elbow pain, reported full range of motion and no pain in his arm during an examination Friday. Bundy is not yet ready to resume throwing. ... Baltimore's Jones returned to the outfield after three straight starts at DH. ... To make room on the roster for Nolin, the Blue Jays placed LHP Darren Oliver (shoulder) on the 15-day DL and moved LHP J.A. Happ (head, knee) from the 15-day DL to the 60-day DL. ... Toronto will make another move Saturday to replace Nolin.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DETROIT -- Add another near miss in this 2013 baseball season -- this time it was Detroit's Anibal Sanchez falling just short of a no-hitter.	Sanchez's bid was broken up with one out in the ninth inning Friday night when Minnesota's Joe Mauer hit a clean single up the middle. That was the only hit the right-hander allowed in the Tigers' 6-0 victory against the Twins. It was the fourth one-hitter of Sanchez's career, to go along with a no-hitter he threw as a rookie back in 2006.	"It's not that I go to the mound and want to do something special; it's just that I want to go nine innings, go deeper, get a good command, get a good game," Sanchez said. "When I come to the eighth inning, I think about it. But when I come to the ninth inning, it's really tough with those guys."	After seven no-hitters in 2012, baseball is without one so far this season. There have been plenty of close calls. Before Sanchez, four other pitchers already had thrown one-hitters in 2013, according to STATS. And that doesn't include Yu Darvish of Texas, Clay Buchholz of Boston and Adam Wainwright of St. Louis, all of whom had no-hitters in the eighth inning or later but couldn't finish the job and the game.	Darvish came within an out of a perfect game at Houston on April 2. He allowed a hit and didn't finish the game.	Mauer, meanwhile, is making a habit of playing spoiler. It's the third time in his career he's broken up a no-hitter in the ninth inning, according to STATS.	"He's nasty, and he had everything working tonight," Mauer said. "Obviously, you know exactly what is happening, and you don't want to get no-hit. I'm just up there trying to put the bat on the ball. He threw me a really good cutter and I was just able to square it up."	It was Sanchez's second gem in about a month -- he set a franchise record with 17 strikeouts in eight marvelous innings against Atlanta on April 26.	Sanchez (5-4) struck out 12 on Friday and allowed three walks -- staying remarkably calm on the mound all the while.	"He called me out to the mound. In the middle of a no-hitter," Tigers catcher Alex Avila said. "I've been in the middle of a no-hitter a few times, in the sixth, seventh inning, I don't think a pitcher's ever called me out to the mound. ... He just forgot what signs we were using when there's a guy on second base."	The home crowd gave Sanchez a standing ovation when he came out to start the ninth, and he immediately struck out Jamey Carroll. Mauer followed with a line drive up the middle -- to almost the same spot where Pittsburgh's Josh Harrison's hit landed last year when he broke up a no-hit bid by Detroit's Justin Verlander, also with two outs to go.	Sanchez instinctively reached up for Mauer's hit, but there was no chance for anyone -- least of all the pitcher -- to catch it. Sanchez then jerked his head back and spun in frustration, but with a bit of a smile on his face.	"We got the hit, but that doesn't change anything," Mauer said. "He still blew us away."	After Sanchez struck out the next two hitters to end the game, he shared a hug with Avila. Sanchez threw 130 pitches.	"In the end, it's the result of my work. I try to figure out, to put my ball in the strike zone," Sanchez said. "It's a nice result, and I take it."	Jordan Zimmermann of Washington, Chris Sale of the Chicago White Sox, Shelby Miller of St. Louis and Jon Lester of Boston have also thrown one-hitters this season. Matt Harvey of the New York Mets allowed one hit in nine innings against the White Sox on May 7, but that game went 10 innings and he didn't finish it.	The last-place Twins have lost 10 straight, and their starting lineup against Sanchez included four players hitting .212 or worse. Carroll drew a walk to lead off the game, and Sanchez issued another to Chris Parmelee in the second. Then the 29-year-old Sanchez, acquired by the Tigers from the Miami Marlins at midseason last year, settled into quite a groove.	He fanned Mauer for the third out of the third, then struck out the side the fourth.	Parmelee led off the fifth with a hard grounder up the middle that Sanchez was able to field himself. The following inning, Brian Dozier nearly broke up the no-hit bid when he hit a slow roller to shortstop Jhonny Peralta and almost beat the throw the first.	Sanchez then struck out Carroll and Mauer to end the Minnesota sixth.	With one out in the eighth, the Twins finally got another runner on base when Eduardo Escobar walked. That snapped a streak of 18 straight hitters retired by Sanchez, but he bounced back to retire pinch-hitter Ryan Doumit on a grounder to first. Pinch-hitter Chris Colabello followed, and with the crowd on its feet, he was called out on strikes.	Miguel Cabrera hit a two-run single in the second, upping his RBI total to 57. Don Kelly added a two-run homer the following inning.	Minnesota's Samuel Deduno (0-1) allowed six runs and nine hits in 5 1/3 innings.	The most recent no-hitter thrown by a Tiger was in 2011, when Verlander tossed the second of his career. The Twins were no-hit last year by Jered Weaver of the Los Angeles Angels.	Game notes	Sanchez's no-hitter as a rookie came Sept. 6, 2006, against Arizona. He was pitching for the Marlins then. ... Sanchez threw 121 pitches before being taken out of his 17-strikeout game against the Braves, but there was no way manager Jim Leyland was pulling him Friday while the no-hit bid was in progress.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BOSTON -- John Lackey is rolling again after two rough seasons that made his rich contract seem like a waste of money.	Now the Boston Red Sox are getting what they paid for.	Lackey allowed two hits in seven innings, gave up no earned runs for his second straight start and led the Red Sox to an 8-1 win over the Cleveland Indians on a rainy Friday night.	"I had one bad year and needed surgery afterwards," he said, "It's not like I've never been good before."	Lackey was 14-11 in his first season after signing a five-year, $82.5 million contract as a free agent. Then he faltered in 2011, going 12-12 with a 6.41 ERA while battling elbow problems. He had Tommy John surgery after that season and missed all of 2012.	Now he's 3-4 with a 2.72 ERA in a season in which he's allowed more than three earned runs in just one of his seven starts. And he said his elbow feels fine.	"He's not thinking about anything that's taken place in the past, either performance-wise or injury-wise," Red Sox manager John Farrell said. "The benefit that he had coming into this year was that spring training started 16 months post-op for him, so he was a little bit further along in the recovery than maybe the typical Tommy John" patient.	His season is going so well that the crowd, which booed him often during the 2011 season, chanted "Lackey, Lackey" after he finished his night by striking out Mark Reynolds and Jason Giambi to end the seventh inning.	"It's been a lot of fun," Lackey said. "My arm strength is getting better. Endurance is getting better. Things are going on the right track."	Mike Carp began the scoring with a three-run homer in the second, breaking an 0-for-21 slump.	"It definitely means a lot," he said. "I've been struggling for playing time and to have a big at bat like that it builds confidence heading into the next couple days."	The homer also ended a 20-inning scoreless streak for Justin Masterson (7-3) and followed a walk to David Ortiz and a single by Mike Napoli.	"This was probably the first (start) I didn't really feel the greatest," Masterson said. "I was just kind of pushing (the ball) to the plate. I don't know if the weather had anything to do with that."	The Indians fell out of first place in the AL Central and a half-game behind the Detroit Tigers, who beat the Minnesota Twins 6-0. The Red Sox remained one game behind the AL East-leading New York Yankees, who beat the Tampa Bay Rays 9-4.	It was the second straight strong performance by Lackey. Last Sunday he gave up one hit and one unearned run in six innings of a 5-1 win at Minnesota. He left that game after a three-hour rain delay.	The start of Friday's game was delayed by 44 minutes.	"Both teams play in it, so it's a better night if you're winning," Indians manager Terry Francona said.	Lackey struck out eight, walked three and gave up an unearned run while pitching through a steady rain. He allowed only two of the 25 batters he faced to hit the ball out of the infield.	"He had velocity," Francona said. "He ended up throwing that cutter very effectively, kind of ran it in on our lefties. As he got more successful with it, he started bringing it off the plate a little bit, opening up the rest of the plate."	He also made a nice fielding play, ranging toward first base to pick up a grounder, skidding on his knees and throwing out speedy Michael Bourn in the sixth.	"It was kind of a crazy night with the rain, kind of got everybody a little off balance probably," catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia said, "but Lack did a great job. I think regardless of anything he was going to go out there and do that."	Former Red Sox manager Francona received an ovation when he walked back to the dugout after making two pitching changes in the seventh, when Boston scored four runs. Francona returned to Fenway Park as an opposing manager on Thursday night for the first time since he was let go by the Red Sox after the 2011 season. The Indians won that game 12-3.	After Carp's homer, the Indians made it 3-1 in the third. Singles by Reynolds and Michael Brantley put runners at first and second before Lackey retired two batters. On a double-steal attempt, Saltalamacchia threw the ball into left field, allowing Reynolds to score and Brantley to reach third.	The Red Sox made it 4-1 in the sixth when they loaded the bases with one out. Daniel Nava was hit by a pitch and Dustin Pedroia and Ortiz singled. Napoli grounded to shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera, who threw to second baseman Jason Kipnis for a forceout. Kipnis' throw to first pulled Nick Swisher off the bag as Napoli reached safely and Nava scored. Pedroia also tried to score, but Swisher threw him out.	Boston took an 8-1 lead in the seventh on two-run singles by Jacoby Ellsbury and Pedroia.	Game notes	Giambi is hitless in his last 26 at bats after going 0-for-4. .. Cleveland activated Swisher off the paternity list and optioned IF Cord Phelps to Triple-A Columbus. ... The Red Sox recalled RHP Alfredo Aceves and IF Jose Iglesias from Triple-A Pawtucket and placed OF Shane Victorino and 3B Will Middlebrooks on the 15-day disabled list. They also activated C David Ross off the 7-day concussion disabled list and sent C Ryan Lavarnway to Pawtucket. ... Cleveland's Scott Kazmir (2-2) faces Jon Lester (6-1) on Saturday in the third game of the four-game series.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CINCINNATI --  Ryan Hanigan was surprised he even got the chance.	The Cubs decided to pitch to the Reds catcher with two outs, two on and the pitcher up next.	Hanigan hit a three-run homer that put Cincinnati ahead to stay, and the Reds beat the Cubs 7-4 on Friday night for their fourth straight win.	Joey Votto extended his hitting streak to 12 games with a solo homer, and Brandon Phillips added a two-run shot. But it was Hanigan's second homer that made the difference.	With starter Bronson Arroyo on deck in the fourth inning, Cubs starter Scott Feldman (4-4) fell behind 3-0 in the count to Hanigan, then decided to try to get him out. Hanigan worked the count full before connecting for a 5-3 lead.	Surprised he even got the chance?	"A little bit," Hanigan said. "At that point in the game, I didn't think a pinch-hitter was coming in. They went at me and I got a pitch to handle. That was a big turn in the game, a five-run inning."	The game-turning pitch was a hanging curve.	"That was a really bonehead pitch," Feldman said. "With the pitcher on deck, I threw the one pitch he can hit for a three-run homer. That one stings a little bit."	The big inning kept the Reds on the upswing. They've won 12 of their past 15 games, surging to a season-high 12 games over .500. At 30-18, they're three wins ahead of their pace last season, when they won 97 games and the NL Central.	They've dominated the Cubs, winning 15 of their past 17. The Reds are 18-5 overall against the Cubs in the past two seasons.	Chicago is last in the NL Central, having lost a season-high five straight. The Cubs (18-29) slid a season-low 11 games under .500.	Votto and Hanigan homered in the fourth inning off Feldman, who had only one bad inning. Feldman gave up five runs in the fourth, the same number he'd allowed in his past five starts combined.	Phillips hit a two-run shot in the eighth off Hector Rondon.	Arroyo (5-4) gave up three runs and six hits in six innings, including Feldman's first career homer. Jonathan Broxton allowed Luis Valbuena's RBI single in the eighth.	Aroldis Chapman pitched the ninth for his 11th save in 13 chances. After blowing a pair of save opportunities, the left-hander has converted his past three. He gave up a single and a walk and fanned three.	The Reds had their third sellout crowd of the season, and the last two games of the series will draw capacity crowds as well.	The Cubs stacked their lineup with six position players and a starting pitcher who bat left-handed, trying a different approach against Arroyo. It worked, but not well enough.	"I didn't feel great the whole game, to be honest," Arroyo said. "They ran seven left-handers against me. They had guys from the left side that I hadn't seen a lot.	"It was a grind for me, to be honest."	Arroyo had trouble keeping his pitches down at the outset. Darwin Barney had a sacrifice fly in the second inning, and Feldman followed with his first career homer, a two-run shot for a 3-0 lead. Cubs pitchers have driven in 15 runs this season, most in the majors.	The three-run inning ended Arroyo's streak of 15 1/3 scoreless innings, his best of the season. The right-hander has won his past three starts.	Feldman had his streak of five impressive starts fall apart in the fourth.	Votto led off with his eighth homer, extending his hitting streak to 12 games, the longest by a Reds player this season. He leads the NL with a .361 batting average.	And that was just the start. Phillips followed with a single, stretching his hitting streak to a season-best 11 games, and eventually scored on Xavier Paul's single. Hanigan's three-run homer -- his second -- made it 5-3.	The five runs matched the most allowed by the Cubs in an inning this season. They were the most earned runs allowed by Feldman in a game this season.	Game notes	 The Reds have homered in each of their past nine games, their longest such streak since 2010. ... The Reds placed LH Sean Marshall on the 15-day DL before the game, the second time he's been sidelined by a sore pitching shoulder this season. LH Manny Parra was activated off the DL to take his place. ... LF Ryan Ludwick said his comeback from shoulder surgery is on schedule. He tore cartilage while sliding into third base on opening day. He's expected back after the All-Star break. ... Umpire Bob Davidson called a balk on Arroyo. ... LH Travis Wood, obtained by Chicago in the trade for Marshall in December 2011, makes his fourth career start against the Reds on Saturday. He's 0-1 with a 4.42 ERA against the Reds.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK --  An overnight wait was worth it for the Atlanta Braves.	Dan Uggla hit an RBI single in the 10th inning soon after a suspended game resumed, and the Braves beat the New York Mets 7-5 Saturday for their seventh straight win.	"Sometimes you wonder how long these games will last," Atlanta manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "I'm glad we were able to finish it off."	Friday night's game was halted because of rain after eight innings with the score 5-all. It took 42 minutes to complete it.	The game picked up right where it left off, at the start of the ninth inning. There was no national anthem, fans were scattered in the stands and it was cloudy and windy with temperatures in the low 50s.	The Mets lost their fourth in a row overall and seventh straight at home. Atlanta and New York were originally scheduled to play Saturday at 7:10 p.m. The resumption ended about 20 minutes before that start time, and the first pitch was pushed back 15 minutes.	"As I said before, when you're playing bad baseball, you've got to play perfect baseball to win. And so when we don't execute some things, certainly it comes back to hurt us," Mets manager Terry Collins said.	After Justin Upton grounded into inning-ending double play with runners at the corners in the Atlanta ninth, the Braves won it in the 10th.	Freddie Freeman, who homered Friday night before the rain came, drew a leadoff walk from Brandon Lyon (1-2) and took third on a double by Brian McCann.	Uggla, who hit a late home run the previous night at Citi Field, followed with his go-ahead single. B.J. Upton later squeezed home pinch-runner Jordan Schafer.	"That was good, heads-up play by them on the bunt. It wasn't called," Gonzalez said.	Anthony Varvaro (2-0) pitched a scoreless ninth. He worked the eighth a day earlier and gave up two runs that made it 5-all. Gonzalez said Varvaro wouldn't pitch in Saturday night's game.	Craig Kimbrel escaped a two-on, no-out jam in the 10th for his 15th save in 18 tries. John Buck was hit by a pitch leading off and Ike Davis, who struck out in all four at-bats Friday, singled for his second hit in 43 at-bats.	But Ruben Tejada popped up a sacrifice bunt try and pinch-hitter Justin Turner grounded into a double play that ended it.	The Braves' previous suspended game was April 5, 1997, against the Cubs -- it was the second game ever played at Turner Field and was stopped because of rain in the seventh inning. Atlanta won the resumption the next day.	The Mets lost in their first suspended game since Aug. 6, 1986, when the second game of a doubleheader against the Cubs was halted after the seventh for darkness -- Wrigley Field didn't have lights then. The Mets won the completion the next day.	When the Mets took the field Saturday, the public-address announcer said Bobby Parnell was now pitching for New York. Greg Burke finished out the eighth Friday night while reliever Robert Carson warmed up.	The Braves took a 5-3 lead in the eighth on a two-run single by pinch-hitter Evan Gattis. The Mets evened it in the bottom half against Varvaro, who struggled to get a good grip but threw a wild pitch that let the tying run score.	The game was suspended after a 75-minute delay. The start was delayed by rain for 16 minutes.	Uggla hit a solo homer in the Atlanta seventh that made it 3-all. Buck had also connected.	Game notes	 Gonzalez said RHP Brandon Beachy (Tommy John surgery in 2012) is "progressing well." Beachy pitched four innings and gave up two runs Friday night in a Triple-A rehab start. ... Atlanta RHP Jordan Walden (shoulder inflammation) threw a side session Friday and will have another one Sunday. ... The clubs combined TV crews to show the resumption, with Mets announcer Keith Hernandez working with Braves broadcaster Joe Simpson. The regularly scheduled game was a Fox national game.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Another injury marred a New York Yankees' victory.	Outfielder Curtis Granderson broke the knuckle on his left pinkie finger in the Yankees' 9-4 win over the Tampa Bay Rays on Friday night.	Yankees manager Joe Girardi had no official timeline for how long Granderson will be out, but indicated it could be a minimum of four weeks.	"It is what it is," said Granderson, who will see a hand specialist in New York on Monday. "You can't change it right now, you've got to move forward."	Granderson broke the knuckle getting hit by Cesar Ramos' pitch in the fifth. After later scoring, he was replaced defensively by Ichiro Suzuki in the bottom of the inning.	Granderson missed the first 38 games this season with a broken right forearm, the result of a hit by pitch in his first at-bat at spring training.	"Another bump in the road," Granderson said.	Granderson said at this point he was told surgery will not be required.	"It's sad," Yankees second baseman Robinson Cano said. "It's really tough. He's one of those guys you're going to miss. Hopefully he gets back soon."	David Phelps (3-2), who retired his first 13 batters before James Loney hit a one-out double in the fifth, allowed four runs and six hits in 7 2/3 innings. He left in the eighth after he was hit on the right forearm by a drive up the middle by Ben Zobrist.	X-rays were negative, and Phelps did not rule out making his next start.	"It's a little sore," Phelps said. "See how that feels tomorrow morning will be a bigger thing. I'll be fine."	The Yankees have been hit hard by injuries this season. Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez, Andy Pettitte, Mark Teixeira and Kevin Youkilis are among the players on the disabled list.	"I'm happy that we won the game, but you lost a really good player," Girardi said. "That's never a good thing."	Brett Gardner, Lyle Overbay and Jayson Nix each drove in two runs for the Yankees.	Gardner made it 5-0 with a two-run homer off Roberto Hernandez (2-5) during the fourth. The Yankees took a 3-0 lead in the second on Overbay's two-run double and an RBI single by Nix.	Tampa Bay slugger Evan Longoria went 0 for 4 and had his career-best 16-game hitting streak end.	Nix walked with the bases loaded, Chris Stewart had a run-scoring single and Cano picked up an RBI when he was hit by Ramos' pitch as the Yankees went ahead 8-0 in the fifth.	Matt Joyce had an RBI double during the Rays' three-run sixth.	Nix tripled and scored to put the Yankees up 9-3 on a wild pitch in the seventh.	After falling behind 3-0 in the third, the Rays intentionally walked Cano with runners on first and second and two outs. The move proved successful when Hernandez got an infield pop fly from Vernon Wells.	Hernandez gave up five runs, six hits and three walks in four innings. He was coming off a start last Saturday against Baltimore where he allowed five runs and eight hits over two innings.	"Pitching won the game for them and not for us," Rays manager Joe Maddon said. "I thought we had some good at-bats, but they did beat us on the mound. We have to pitch better to win."	Tampa Bay's Matt Moore will look Saturday to become the fifth-youngest pitcher since 1916 to start a season 9-0 exclusively as a starter. The 23-year old left-hander will go against Vidal Nuno (1-1).	According to the Rays, if Moore gets the win Saturday, only Ken Holtzman (1967), Livan Hernandez (1997), Roger Clemens (1986) and Jered Weaver (2006) will have accomplished the feat at a younger age.	Game notes	Maddon said AL Cy Young Award winner David Price, who went on the 15-day disabled list May 16 with a left triceps strain, is getting well. "I don't have any kind of finish line there yet," Maddon said. ... The Yankees are 11-5 since May 8.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

CHICAGO --  John Danks wanted to pitch deeper into the game.	Nevertheless, he was still happy with the results.	Danks was solid in his season debut and Jeff Keppinger drove in the winning run on a single in the 11th inning and the Chicago White Sox beat the Miami Marlins 4-3 on Friday night.	Danks allowed three runs and four hits in six innings in his first start since undergoing shoulder surgery in August to repair a capsule tear and remove debris in his rotator cuff and biceps. He struck out five, walked none and hit a batter in the opener of the interleague series.	"It was a good first one," Danks said. "I did as much as I had hoped to do. Obviously, as the game went on, I wanted to go further, but I totally understand the move, totally agree with the move and I'm glad we got the win."	Danks went 3-4 with a 5.70 ERA in nine starts last season as the team's opening day starter. He last pitched May 19, 2012, against the Cubs. The left-hander made four minor-league rehab starts before debuting Friday.	He threw 76 pitches, allowing a two-run home run to Derek Dietrich in the fourth.	"The best part was his command and keeping everything in check and doing everything he needed to do," White Sox manager Robin Ventura said. "He was getting people to swing and miss. It's what you would expect of him coming back and being at full strength."	Paul Konerko started the White Sox rally with a one-out single in the 11th. Pinch runner Tyler Greene moved to third when Dayan Viciedo singled off the glove of second baseman Dietrich.	After Ryan Webb (1-2) intentionally walked Conor Gillaspie, Keppinger singled to left field.	"It just feels like our offense is starting to do a little bit more and we're still getting good pitching," Keppinger said.	Nate Jones (1-4) pitched two-thirds of an inning for the win.	Marlins starter Tom Koehler gave up three runs in six innings in his first career interleague start. He struck out three and walked one.	Koehler remained in the game after a Keppinger line drive struck him on the back of his right shoulder in the third inning. Koehler said the ball struck him underneath his shoulder blade.	"It actually hit me in a pretty decent spot," Koehler said. "As far as affecting the way I threw, it had no bearing on anything, which was nice. It will be a little sore tomorrow, but it shouldn't be anything to worry about."	The Marlins tied it 3-3 in the seventh. Marcell Ozuna led off with a double, forcing Danks from the game.	Ozuna advanced on a Justin Ruggiano single off Matt Lindstrom and scored on a Miguel Olivo sacrifice fly. After a Nick Green single loaded the bases, Lindstrom got a double play to end the inning.	Konerko hit a go-ahead, two-out single off Koehler for a 3-2 White Sox lead in the sixth. Alex Rios scored after extending his career-high and AL-leading hitting streak to 18 games with a one-out single.	Dietrich hit a two-run homer off Danks for a 2-0 Marlins lead in the fourth. Placido Polanco scored after leading off with a single for the Marlins' first hit.	"I felt great. I felt really good," Danks said. "I felt like I was able to make the ball move and do what I wanted to do for the most part. There were a few pitches I would like to have back. I felt like I made a good pitch to Polanco, and he got a knock and the homer. I should have thought more about that one."	The White Sox scored two runs to tie it 2-2 in the fifth. Keppinger's RBI groundout scored Viciedo, who reached on a force out and advanced on a Gillaspie double. Hector Gimenez hit a two-out single to tie it.	The White Sox threatened in the 10th. Keppinger led off with a single before Chad Qualls hit Gimenez with a pitch. Both runners advanced on an Alejandro De Aza sacrifice bunt. After Qualls intentionally walked Alexei Ramirez, Rios hit into an inning-ending double play with a close call at first that brought out Ventura to talk to umpire Angel Hernandez. Replays showed Rios' foot on the bag before the throw arrived.	"You have to put it behind you," Ventura said. "Fortunately, you get somebody on, and Paulie gets on and Tank (Viciedo) got that hit (in the 11th). Stuff happens. You just have to roll with it."	Game notes	 The White Sox are hopeful LHP Chris Sale will make his scheduled start on Tuesday against the Cubs. He missed his start Wednesday against the Red Sox because of shoulder tendinitis. "In my mind, I'm going for sure, but I don't know what (the team has)," Sale said. "That's the target. That's what we're shooting for, but just like anything else, it's out of my hands." Sale said he felt good going through his shoulder program and he plans to play long toss Saturday. ... White Sox 2B Gordon Beckham won't play in his rehab assignment at Triple-A Charlotte until at least Wednesday because he is experiencing soreness in his left hand, general manager Rick Hahn said. The hamate bone in Beckham's left hand was removed April 16, and he began a rehab assignment May 18. "It's nothing to be alarmed about," Hahn said. ... To make room for Danks, the White Sox optioned LHP Donnie Veal to Triple-A after Wednesday's game.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- After a disappointing start to the season, the Los Angeles Angels are heating up.	Mike Trout had his 21st multi-hit game, Jason Vargas pitched into the eighth inning and the Los Angeles Angels beat the Kansas City Royals 5-2 on Friday night to extend their winning streak to six games.	Trout had two hits, stole his 11th base and scored two runs, including one on a wild pitch. He is hitting .366 in May.	"You don't want to bank on extended streaks, but you do want to get on a roll," Trout said. "We probably could have done some things better tonight, but we got some clutch hits when we needed them. Jason got some huge ground balls when he needed them. You know what you are going to get from him. He throws strikes and works quick."	Vargas (4-3) allowed two runs and five hits over 7 1/3 innings to win is fourth straight decision in five May starts. Vargas, who is 12-4 in May since the start of the 2009 season, went 0-3 in April.	"I don't feel any different than before," Vargas said. "It's just that the situations and outcomes have been different. I've been a little more efficient with pitch counts and controlling the count. "	Vargas has lowered his ERA from 6.74 on April 16 to 3.43.	"He's using both sides of the plate and changing speeds," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "He understands his stuff and is very consistent with it. He's letting his defense make plays."	Trout led off the Angels' three-run seventh with a walk and stole second. Mark Trumbo extended his hitting streak to nine games with a RBI-single. The inning also included Albert Pujols scoring on a Howie Kendrick sacrifice fly and Trumbo scoring on Alberto Callaspo's double.	The Angels had chances against Kansas City starter Luis Mendoza, but the team was 1-for-9 with runners in scoring position against him.	"My ball was everywhere," Mendoza said. "I just tried to don't get hurt."	Trout scored the only run off Mendoza in the third inning and that was on a wild pitch with two out. He bumped into Mendoza at the plate.	"A little bit, just my left knee, but there is nothing serious," Mendoza said. "I'm good."	Miguel Tejada's second home run of the week and the 306th of his career tied the score in the third.	In the fifth, Lorenzo Cain singled and stole second. Vargas intentionally walked Tejada with two outs, but Chris Getz's singled up the middle to score Cain.	Luke Hochevar (0-1), who replaced Mendoza, could not keep the 2-1 lead for long. Chris Iannetta homered for the second straight night to tie it 2-2 before the Angels broke it open in the seventh.	Mendoza allowed seven hits and a run in five innings. He walked four and had two wild pitches.	Garrett Richards, who replaced Vargas, got Getz to ground into a double play to end the eighth with runners on the corners. Richards got the final five outs for his first save in two opportunities.	The Royals lost for the 14th time in 18 games to fall a season-worst three-games below .500. They have scored two or less runs in 11 of those defeats.	"I don't feel like we're pressing," Royals designated hitter Billy Butler said. "I just don't feel like we're catching breaks here-and-there. It's a tough night.	"We're falling on the wrong side of things right now. A hit here, a hit there and we're back in it. We've been in a lot of close games lately, one hit away, one pitch away, it seems like every game."	Game notes	RHP Billy Buckner, who was a rookie in 2007 with the Royals, will start Saturday. He will be the 10th starter used by the Angels, while the club used only eight starters last year. He was promoted May 16 from Triple-A Salt Lake, where he was 4-2 with a 4.56 ERA in eight starts. ... 3B Mike Moustakas, who is hitting .149 in May, was not in the Royals lineup. Tejada started at third. ... Royals LHP Danny Duffy, who had reconstructive elbow surgery last June, will begin a minor league rehab assignment Sunday with Double-A Northwest Arkansas. ... Callaspo has nine RBIs in his past 11 games. ... Angels starting pitchers have a 1.98 ERA during their six-game winning streak.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MILWAUKEE -- Poor starting pitching has been to blame for much of the Milwaukee Brewers' losing ways over the past few weeks. Marco Estrada worked to change that Friday night.	Estrada gave up one run over seven innings and retired the first 14 batters he faced in leading the Brewers to a 2-1 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates.	Milwaukee had lost 16-of-20 games entering the contest, while the Pirates had a four-game winning streak snapped and lost for just the third time in 14 games	"He had great location today. His fastball was live. He really located it well," Milwaukee manager Ron Roenicke said. "He pitched up when he needed to. He had a good breaking ball and a good changeup and commanded all of his pitches."	Estrada (4-2) didn't allow a hit until a two-out bloop single to left field by Neil Walker in the fifth inning. He struck out eight and didn't walk a batter. He fanned eight of 12 Pittsburgh batters at one point.	"I've been struggling a lot with my curveball. I felt like today that I threw a lot of them for strikes. I just built off of that," Estrada said. "I had really good fastball command and I had a lot of swings (and) misses on the changeup."	Roenicke opted to remove Estrada after seven innings.	"I didn't realize my pitch count was at 100. I wanted to go back out," Estrada said. "You always want to give more. I wish I could have thrown a complete game and given the bullpen a couple more days rest, but I gave the team a chance to win."	Estrada improved his career record to 5-0 against the Pirates, including eight starts.	"He didn't leave many balls over the plate," Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said. "He is tough on us. He is just able to step up and really get the ball in locations he wants to against us. Sure we had a couple balls to hit but it wasn't easy by any means."	Estrada said he's been attempting to mimic the fast-paced pitching of teammate Kyle Lohse.	"He just gets the ball and goes. He throws a lot of strikes," Estrada said. "Everyone is more alert. It showed today with the defense. I was so quick."	Four Brewers relievers combined to record the final six outs. Francisco Rodriguez retired the final batter to record his first save of the season and 295th of his career. Rodriguez's last save came last July 18.	Rodriguez entered the game after Brewers closer Jim Henderson sustained a right hamstring injury while attempting to field a hard grounder off the bat of Russell Martin.	"He felt his hamstring grab on him," Roenicke said. "We'll re-evaluate it tomorrow and see where we are. I don't think it's just going to be a day."	Roenicke said he's unsure if he'll name a closer if Henderson is out for an extended period.	"I don't know if we want to go with just one person. We may look at the matchups and see what they are every night," he said.	Rodriguez said he's prepared to close if called upon, but expressed concern for his injured bullpen mate.	"That's the last thing you want to see," Rodriguez said. "Jim's been doing such a good job and to see him go down like that is not good at all. Hopefully, we can have him as soon as possible."	Estrada outpitched Pirates starter A.J. Burnett (3-5), who gave up three hits and two earned runs over seven innings. Burnett struck out six and walked two. He retired 17 of the final 19 batters he faced. The Brewers managed just four hits for the game.	"Once I got some work in, I settled down and got to where I needed to be," Burnett said. "That is a heck of outing from both guys. You may beat me but you will never out-compete me."	The Brewers scored their only runs of the game in second inning. Aramis Ramirez led off the inning with a walk. After Martin Maldonado struck out, Carlos Gomez laced an opposite-field, line-drive double that just missed hitting Ramirez, who was leading off first base. Ramirez and Gomez scored on Alex Gonzalez's one-out double.	"That was big. It was a good pitch and Alex went down and got it. It was smart hitting," Roenicke said. "We certainly needed to get a lead and with the way Marco pitched we held on."	The Pirates didn't threaten until the sixth inning, when Starling Marte tripled down the left-field line with two outs. Estrada struck out Travis Snider to end the inning. Pittsburgh finally got to Estrada in the seventh when	Walker hit a two-out double, scoring Martin, who reached on a fielder's choice.	"(Estrada) made pitches when he had to. We didn't give ourselves enough opportunities to capitalize," Walker said. "When he has been really good, this is the game he throws."	Game notes	Estrada laced an opposite-field single in the fifth inning, one of only three hits against Burnett. "He threw me a fastball and I'm pretty sure he missed. I just made contact and it found a hole," Estrada said. .The Brewers placed starting pitcher Hiram Burgos on the 15-day disabled list. Relief pitcher Tom Gorzelanny was reinstated from the DL. . Burnett entered the game with a National League-leading 79 strikeouts. The only other Pirate pitcher since 1900 to have at least 79 strikeouts by the end of May is Bob Veale, who had 81 in 1966. Burnett added six strikeouts to his season total Friday night .The game marked the start of stretch in which Milwaukee will play 20 games over 20 days. .Estrada threw 100 pitches, 73 for strikes. Burnett threw 99 pitches, 65 for strikes. .The Brewers won for the first time in 20 tries this season when scoring three or fewer runs.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

HOUSTON -- Chris Young has had a tough start to the season, with a sub-.200 batting average and was 0-for-5 entering Friday's game.	Turns out that his slump was nothing a trip home and belly full of mom's barbecue couldn't cure.	Young connected on a three-run homer in the ninth inning to lift the Oakland Athletics to a 6-5 win over the Houston Astros on Friday night.	"Mom's cooking definitely has something to do with it for sure," said Young, who grew up in Houston and spent an off day Thursday with his family. "Barbecue, just good old Texas southern barbeque. It always does the trick for me."	Young is hitting just .189 this season. But he's a career .418 hitter at Minute Maid Park with seven home runs and 27 RBIs in 19 games in his hometown.	Manager Bob Melvin, who also saw Young thrive in Houston when he played for him in Arizona, wasn't surprised by his performance on Friday.	"He's got quite a track record here in this ballpark," Melvin said. "It seems like every time he comes here whether he's not swinging all that well or he is he ends up doing some big things here."	The A's trailed 5-3 before closer Jose Veras (0-3) walked two of the first three batters of the inning to set the table for Young. He turned on a curveball to put Oakland up 6-5.	"I didn't make the pitch that I was supposed to make, and then I paid for it," Veras said. "You fall behind, fall behind, and then you've got to pay one day."	Young stood at the plate for a couple of seconds admiring the towering shot before heading to first base. He raised both arms and pointed to the section where about 50 friends and relatives were sitting before heading into the dugout after reaching home plate.	"It's nice to have the whole family in the stands," he said. "It's one of the places where you feel a lot of love, a lot of support. Houston's always treated me well, I like coming home so it's partly that and partly the yard plays pretty good for my swing."	Seth Smith had a solo pinch-hit homer for Oakland in the sixth inning.	Pat Neshek (1-0) pitched a scoreless eighth for the win and Grant Balfour walked two in the ninth before getting his 10th save. He has converted 28 straight save opportunities since last season.	J.D. Martinez hit a three-run homer and Matt Dominguez also homered in a five-run fifth inning for the Astros, who fell to 0-7 against Oakland this season.	The Athletics were up by two before Dominguez got Houston's big fifth inning going with his first-pitch home run off Tommy Milone. Jose Altuve tied it with an RBI single before Martinez homered for the second straight game to give the Astros a 5-2 lead.	Houston starter Erik Bedard yielded four hits and two runs in five innings. He gave up both runs in the first inning before settling down.	Milone became the fourth straight Oakland starter to last seven innings. He gave up eight hits and five runs with six strikeouts.	By scoring five runs, the Astros ended a streak of Oakland allowing three or fewer runs in six straight games.	Coco Crisp drew a leadoff walk before Young extended his hitting streak against the Astros to 15 games with a single. An RBI single by Yoenis Cespedes put Oakland up 1-0.	Bedard then plunked Josh Donaldson before retiring Derek Norris for the first out. Luke Montz then grounded into a force out and Young scored to make it 2-0.	Houston couldn't do much against Milone early and he retired 14 of the first 16 batters he faced. He struck out the first two batters of the fifth inning before Dominguez launched his fifth homer of the season to the back of the Crawford Boxes to cut the lead to 2-1.	It was the first of five consecutive hits for the Astros. Ronny Cedeno and Robbie Grossman hit back-to-back singles before Jose Altuve snapped an 0 for 18 slump with an RBI single to tie it at 2-all. Second baseman Eric Sogard almost ended the inning on Cedeno's hit, but the ball dropped just out of his reach after he sprinted and slid to try and snag it in shallow center field.	Martinez gave the Astros a 5-2 lead with his three-run shot. It was Martinez's second consecutive game with a home run after he hit a two-run shot in Houston's win over the Royals on Wednesday.	Milone finally escaped the inning when Carlos Corporan grounded out.	"Really I never even thought about getting anybody up at that point he had been pitching so well and it happened so quickly," Melvin said of the fifth inning. "But it's a little unlike him because he usually can stem the tide and keep from having the big inning like that. It just wasn't the case tonight."	Paul Clemens replaced Bedard for the sixth inning and Smith greeted him with a pinch-hit homer to get Oakland within 5-3. It was the sixth pinch-hit homer of Smith's career and the second by Oakland this season.	Young had a single in the seventh inning and that and his homer were Oakland's only hits after Smith's homer.	Young also had a three-run homer in his last appearance at Minute Maid Park to help the A's to a 9-3 win on April 7.	Game notes	Los Angeles Clippers center DeAndre Jordan, who is from Houston, threw out the first pitch. ... The series continues on Saturday when Oakland's A.J. Griffin faces Lucas Harrell. ... Oakland SS Jed Lowrie was out of the lineup for a second straight game after being hit by a pitch on his right foot on Tuesday night. Melvin said he was feeling better Friday and that the injury wasn't something that would put him on the disabled list. ... Houston OF Justin Maxwell, on the disabled list with a broken bone in his left hand, took about 20 swings in batting practice on Friday and is schedule to go to extended spring training in Florida on Wednesday to take live at-bats. ... Houston minor league OF Jonathan Singleton will finish his 50 game suspension for a drug of abuse and report to Class A Quad Cities on Monday.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

PHOENIX -- Brandon McCarthy felt out of sync, spent most of his night battling, hoping batters would hit balls right at his fielders.	They did, for the most part, allowing Arizona's hitters time to come alive and give the right-hander his first winning streak since being struck on the head by a line drive last season.	McCarthy pitched seven effective innings for his second straight win and Paul Goldschmidt hit a two-run double to cap Arizona's five-run seventh inning, lifting the Diamondbacks to a 5-2 victory over the San Diego Padres on Friday night.	"Today isn't a whole lot dissimilar than some of my starts earlier in the year where luck was on my side with some of it," McCarthy said.	McCarthy (2-3) may not have had his best stuff, but he worked his way through it, long enough for the Diamondbacks to break open a tight game.	Arizona had two hits over the first six innings against Eric Stults (4-4), the hits started to fall in the seventh.	Martin Prado had a run-scoring double, pinch-hitter Wil Nieves followed with another and A.J. Pollock added an RBI single for his third hit. Goldschmidt capped it with a double off Anthony Bass to put Arizona up 5-1.	Everth Cabrera led off the eighth inning with a homer off David Hernandez and the Padres had two on in the ninth, but Heath Bell worked around the trouble for his seventh save to send the Padres to their third straight loss.	"Stultsie and McCarthy were hooked up in a definite pitchers' duel," Padres manager Bud Black said. "Stults threw the ball great. He really did."	Just not as well as McCarthy.	The lanky right-hander was superb in his last start, tossing a three-hitter against Miami for his third career shutout and first win since suffering a life-threatening head injury from a line drive last September.	McCarthy had been on a roll even before that, entering Friday's game with a 17-inning scoreless streak, leaving him two shy of his career best set in 2005.	He topped his personal best by getting through the first inning, then had it abruptly end in the second after Carlos Quentin's leadoff double and an RBI single by Yonder Alonso.	McCarthy was good after that, escaping a couple of base runners in the sixth inning before being replaced for a pinch hitter in the seventh. He allowed a run on five hits.	"That was his third (quality start) in a row, threw the ball the same way," Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson said. "Just really good command of what he was doing, pretty efficient."	Stults had been solid after a couple of rough starts against San Francisco at the end of April, going 2-1 with a 2.39 ERA in four May outings. He allowed a run and four hits in eight innings to beat Washington his last start after carrying a no-hitter into the sixth inning.	Stults' no-hitter run ended a bit earlier against the Diamondbacks: on Pollock's two-out single in the third inning.	The left-hander was still sharp, getting the Diamondbacks to hit soft grounders and lazy fly balls while retiring eight more hitters in a row.	Arizona finally got Stults in the seventh inning, when Miguel Montero led off with a double and Prado spun the next pitch over the first base bag with an inside-out double that tied the game. Nieves, who's played 13 games this season, put the Diamondbacks ahead with a run-scoring double that chased Stults.	Pollock hit Dale Thayer's first -- and only -- pitch to left for a run-scoring single and Goldschmidt reached 20 RBIs in 21 games this month with his double off Bass. Arizona's four doubles in the inning matched a team record set four times, most recently on May 21, 2010, against Toronto.	Stults allowed four runs and six hits in 6 1/3 innings.	"I felt like I got away with some pitches through the sixth inning," Stults said. "Actually, it felt like in the seventh inning I made the pitches I wanted to, (but) just didn't have the results."	Game notes	McCarthy's scoreless-innings streak matched Curt Schilling (2003) for fourth-longest in franchise history behind Brandon Webb (42 innings and 25) and Andy Benes (23 1/3). ... A moment of silence was held before the game for Phoenix Police Officer Daryl Raetz and firefighter Bradley Harper, who were killed in the line of duty in separate incidents on Sunday. ... Arizona LHP Wade Miley will be making his sixth career start against the Padres on Saturday. He is 1/3 with a 6.28 ERA with 13 walks and 18 strikeouts against them. ...

SEATTLE -- Lance Berkman found his home run stroke from the right side of the plate. Justin Grimm struggled early only to rebound and turn in another quality start.	The Texas Rangers had a little of everything go in their favor Friday night, even a double play that shouldn't have been.	Jeff Baker hit a two-run homer and Berkman added a three-run shot, both off Seattle starter Joe Saunders, and the Rangers beat the Mariners 9-5.	Baker's shot in the second inning gave the Rangers the lead, but it was Berkman's fourth homer of the season into the left-field seats that broke the game open in the third and sent Saunders to his first career loss at Safeco Field. It was the first homer for Baker since May 10 and first for Berkman since May 11.	"We got him into some counts where he had to throw a strike and we didn't miss it," Texas manager Ron Washington said. "The big blow was the one Berkman got. We just kept battling him and battling him and got it done."	Grimm (4-3) overcame a rough first few innings to pitch into the seventh despite giving up 10 hits. Grimm avoided a big inning, didn't walk a batter and struck out five in beating the Mariners for the second time this season.	Joe Nathan got his 15th save of the season getting Michael Morse for the final out of the game after Seattle scored twice and had two runners on in the ninth.	Grimm wasn't at his best early in the game as Seattle battered him for eight hits in the first 2 2/3 innings with relievers warming in the Rangers bullpen. But Grimm managed to limit any major damage -- helped by a blown call by first base umpire Jeff Nelson in the second -- before settling down and retiring seven straight batters at one point.	Seattle's chance at a big second inning took a hit with a botched call by Nelson. Jesus Sucre hit a grounder to Mitch Moreland at first, who threw down to second to get the lead runner. The relay from Elvis Andrus back to first was in time to get Sucre but the throw was caught by Grimm running over to cover and not Moreland, whose foot was on the bag. Nelson missed that it was Grimm who caught the throw and called Sucre out.	"That happened so fast. I didn't realize the umpire had called him out at first," Grimm said. "... I was going over to cover the bag and Mitch took it on his own so when Elvis threw the ball it started to come toward me. I didn't think Mitch was going to be able to get to it and I just snagged it up real quick in hopes to save a run and keep the double play in order."	Seattle manager Eric Wedge went out to argue, but his argument was that Moreland had pulled his foot off the bag. He didn't realize until watching the replay later that it was Grimm who caught the throw and it never reached Moreland's glove.	"It would have been a much bigger argument if I had known that at the time," Wedge said.	Some of the furor stopped when Brendan Ryan followed with a two-out RBI double to tie the game at 2 and was further muted by what the Rangers did against Saunders and Seattle's bullpen.	Still, the Rangers realized they got lucky.	"I didn't have to see the replay," Washington said. "I knew we caught a break there."	Saunders (3-5) entered the night 9-0 at Safeco Field, including a 3-0 mark with a 0.94 ERA this season. But Saunders gave up six earned runs and eight hits in just five innings and the Mariners lost their seventh straight.	Saunders' problems started when he walked Nelson Cruz on a 3-2 pitch in the second inning and gave up Baker's opposite-field homer two batters later to give Texas a 2-1 lead. He immediately faced problems in the third giving up a leadoff single to Jurickson Profar and a one-out double to Moreland. After striking out Berkman looking in the first inning, Saunders got just one pitch into the at-bat his next time up. Berkman drove the first pitch out to give the Rangers a 5-2 lead.	Texas scored three more times in the seventh against Seattle's bullpen, capped by David Murphy's two-out, two-run single.	Game notes	Seattle has been outscored 28-6 in the last three games. ... Texas announced after the game that Martin Perez will be called up to start the first game of Monday's day-night doubleheader at Arizona with Yu Darvish likely going in the nightcap. .... Raul Ibanez's had an RBI double in the third inning. It was the 400th double of his career. ... Injured Texas RHP Alexi Ogando (biceps tendinitis) will throw a bullpen session between games of the Rangers' doubleheader on Monday in Arizona. He'll be reassessed after the bullpen and could come off the disabled list next weekend.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

LOS ANGELES -- No Sports Illustrated cover jinx for these Cardinals. They just keep on winning.	Lance Lynn pitched two-hit ball over six innings, and David Freese and Allen Craig each homered and drove in three runs, helping St. Louis beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 7-0 on Friday night for their third win in a row and 11th in its last 13 road games.	Lynn appears with the rest of the rotation on this week's SI cover in a photo inspired by a cover from the Oct. 7, 1968, issue that featured Roger Maris, Tim McCarver, Bob Gibson, Mike Shannon and Lou Brock.	"It's a cool photo," Freese said.	Lynn (7-1) struck out nine and walked one for the NL Central leaders, who earned their eighth shutout win of the season. The only hits he gave up were a single to Carl Crawford to open the game and a double to Juan Uribe in the third.	The right-hander left after just 77 pitches because he felt his lower back tighten up going down to his hamstring.	"It just flared up on me, so we decided it was a good time to shut me down," Lynn said. "As the game went on, it kept getting tighter and tighter. Wish I could have gone longer. With the run support and day off yesterday, it was a good time not to push it."	Lynn is averaging better than a strikeout per inning this season with 66 strikeouts in 61 innings. He relied exclusively on his fastball the first time through the Dodgers' lineup and then mixed it up the second time through.	"That's the plan going in every start for me," he said.	The Dodgers' fifth loss in seven games wasn't how they had planned to open a stretch of 20 games in 20 days.	"We didn't do anything with him," manager Don Mattingly said about Lynn. "He threw a lot of fastballs through the course of the game and we didn't seem to be able to get on them."	Freese played for the first time since cutting his right thumb on Sunday. He had the stitches removed although the cut remained open, but he said it affects him more throwing than hitting. His two hits on Sunday at San Diego were his first since May 4.	"It's feeling good. I feel strong," Freese said about his swing. "The last few games it felt good. It's nice to join the fun."	He improved against left-handed pitching, too, coming in 3 for 25. The Cardinals were hitting .223 against leftys and the team improved to 5-5.	"We're still trying to figure that out," Freese said. "Leftys give us trouble sometimes."	Craig continued his tear in May, when he's batting .363 with three homers and 17 RBI in 21 games this month.	"I believe in myself. I feel like I'm going to get the job done every time," he said. "The guys in front of me have done a great job getting on base."	The last-place Dodgers' loss came a few hours after team president Stan Kasten said Mattingly was not in immediate danger of being fired.	"I do expect things to turn around," Kasten said before the game. "I expect Donnie to be here for a long time."	Chris Capuano (1-3) allowed six runs -- five earned -- and six hits in five-plus innings. The left-hander struck out four and walked three.	"With Allen Craig and David Freese, if you're going away to them, you've got to get the ball away," he said. "If you miss over the outer third or outer half and the ball is coming back to them, they can hurt you."	Freese's two-run homer into the Dodgers' bullpen in left field extended the Cardinals' lead to 6-0 in the sixth. His RBI double in the second drove in Jon Jay with their first run. Dodger catcher A.J. Ellis went down for a few minutes after Jay collided with him, but stayed in the game.	"I'm glad he's not hurt and nothing bad happened for both of us," Jay said.	Craig homered with two outs in the fifth after his two-run double in the third made it 3-0.	"I just started rushing out there and was getting a little frustrated and stuff, and was just kind of speeding things up," Capuano said. "When you're rushing, your location gets a little off."	St. Louis tacked on another run in the seventh when reliever Matt Guerrier gave up consecutive walks to Carlos Beltran and Matt Holliday to open the inning. He then hit Craig to load the bases before Yadier Molina's sacrifice fly scored Beltran.	Dodger sluggers Matt Kemp and Andre Ethier were a combined 0 for 6, with Kemp striking out twice. Ethier returned to the starting lineup after being benched by Mattingly three times in six games on the team's road trip to Atlanta and Milwaukee.	Game notes	The Dodgers were shut out for the fourth time this season and the first since losing 1-0 to Arizona on April 14. ... The Cardinals improved to 17-8 on the road, the most wins away from home in the majors this season. ... Mattingly said SS Hanley Ramirez, on the DL with a strained left hamstring, will play four or five rehab games. "I don't think he's quite as close as it looks," the manager said. ... Dodgers OF Jerry Hairston Jr., on the DL with a strained left groin, played six innings at third base and went 0 for 3 in his first rehab start for Class A Rancho Cucamonga. He's expected to play six innings there on Saturday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN FRANCISCO -- When Michael Cuddyer thinks back to missing the final two months last season, a minimum 15-day stint on the disabled list hardly seemed like a long layoff.	He sure didn't lose his power stroke while nursing his troublesome neck the past two weeks.	Cuddyer homered and hit a two-run double after being activated earlier in the day, Tyler Chatwood beat San Francisco for the second time in seven days and the Colorado Rockies blanked the Giants 5-0 on Friday night.	"Good, good, the neck's good," Cuddyer said. "It felt great. Being able to go out there and help us get the win was nice. I felt comfortable in the box, I didn't feel like I'd missed much time. In the grand scheme of things I really didn't miss that much time."	Carlos Gonzalez also hit a solo homer and DJ LeMahieu added an RBI single as the Rockies beat two-time NL Cy Young Award winner Tim Lincecum for the second time in a week.	Gonzalez was fortunate to play at all. Before the game, a fan threw him a ball point pen to sign an autograph and it hit Gonzalez -- who didn't see it coming -- just under the left eye.	"I still signed it, with a bloody pen," he said, chuckling. "Incredible, ahhh?"	The Rockies, swept in a three-game series at AT&T Park last month, won their fourth in a row in the rivalry for the first time since 2006.	Colorado also snapped a nine-game losing streak at AT&T Park with its first win in the waterfront ballpark since Aug. 10, 2012. San Francisco was shut out at home for the first time since that same game, also started and won by Chatwood -- he beat Lincecum that day, too.	"It's pretty neat to do that against that lineup," Chatwood said. "They're a great hitting team. Any time you can have success against a lineup like that, it's big."	Cuddyer's two-out double in the first gave Colorado a quick cushion, then he connected for his eighth home run with a solo shot leading off the sixth. He also scored two runs after returning to the Rockies' lineup from the 15-day disabled list.	Cuddyer, batting fifth and playing right field after missing time with an inflamed cervical disk, went 2 for 4 with three RBIs. Gonzalez homered leading off the eighth against Sandy Rosario, Gonzalez's team-leading 12th clout.	"I felt pretty good physically," Lincecum said. "Mechanically I felt good. Just a couple of pitches that got away from me and they really made me pay for it."	Lincecum struck out eight and walked two over seven innings in his second consecutive start against Colorado and third in all this year. The right-hander allowed four runs and seven hits after taking the loss against the Rockies at Coors Field last Saturday.	He has defeats in four of his past five decisions. He has allowed 16 earned runs in his past 18 innings against the Rockies this season for an 8.00 ERA.	"I just have to stop making mistakes up in the zone against them," he said. "If I miss with my spots they have to be down or away. But things are right in the middle of the plate."	Chatwood allowed four hits in six scoreless innings, struck out four and walked one in another lopsided Rockies result against the reigning World Series champions. Colorado shut out San Francisco 5-0 in the series finale in Denver last Sunday.	The Rockies (27-21) remained in a first-place tie with Arizona atop the NL West standings after the Diamondbacks beat San Diego in Phoenix, with the Giants one game back.	"They've dominated us every time here," Gonzalez said. "That gives us a lot of confidence when you can win a series against a team that won the championship a couple of times the last few years."	San Francisco's Marco Scutaro went 0 for 3 after having hit safely in each of his previous 15 games against Colorado, his former club before being traded to the Giants last July. But the Giants generated few opportunities against Chatwood and the Colorado bullpen.	Wilton Lopez, the Rockies' third reliever, finished the five-hit shutout.	Game notes	Rockies manager Walt Weiss said RHP Rafael Betancourt would not need a DL stint for his groin injury. He threw a light bullpen before the game and was available to close the game. ... San Francisco starter Ryan Vogelsong, who had surgery on his broken right hand Tuesday, is keeping his sense of humor about an injury that will sideline him about two months. "I hit myself in the face last night, sleeping with it," he said of the heavily wrapped hand. "That didn't feel too good." He wears a sling sometimes, which "kind of tells everyone not to run into me." Manager Bruce Bochy said the Giants would announce their fill-in for Vogelsong's spot Tuesday at Oakland after Sunday's finale with Colorado. ... A decision about whether Giants RHP Santiago Casilla would have arthroscopic surgery was expected soon. ... Weiss plans to continue resting young C Wilin Rosario for day games after night games to keep him fresh. ... The Giants lost in one of Lincecum's starts for only the fifth time in the past 16 dating to last season.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

NEW YORK --  An overnight wait was worth it for the Atlanta Braves.	Dan Uggla hit an RBI single in the 10th inning soon after a suspended game resumed, and the Braves beat the New York Mets 7-5 Saturday for their seventh straight win.	"Sometimes you wonder how long these games will last," Atlanta manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "I'm glad we were able to finish it off."	Friday night's game was halted because of rain after eight innings with the score 5-all. It took 42 minutes to complete it.	The game picked up right where it left off, at the start of the ninth inning. There was no national anthem, fans were scattered in the stands and it was cloudy and windy with temperatures in the low 50s.	The Mets lost their fourth in a row overall and seventh straight at home. Atlanta and New York were originally scheduled to play Saturday at 7:10 p.m. The resumption ended about 20 minutes before that start time, and the first pitch was pushed back 15 minutes.	"As I said before, when you're playing bad baseball, you've got to play perfect baseball to win. And so when we don't execute some things, certainly it comes back to hurt us," Mets manager Terry Collins said.	After Justin Upton grounded into inning-ending double play with runners at the corners in the Atlanta ninth, the Braves won it in the 10th.	Freddie Freeman, who homered Friday night before the rain came, drew a leadoff walk from Brandon Lyon (1-2) and took third on a double by Brian McCann.	Uggla, who hit a late home run the previous night at Citi Field, followed with his go-ahead single. B.J. Upton later squeezed home pinch-runner Jordan Schafer.	"That was good, heads-up play by them on the bunt. It wasn't called," Gonzalez said.	Anthony Varvaro (2-0) pitched a scoreless ninth. He worked the eighth a day earlier and gave up two runs that made it 5-all. Gonzalez said Varvaro wouldn't pitch in Saturday night's game.	Craig Kimbrel escaped a two-on, no-out jam in the 10th for his 15th save in 18 tries. John Buck was hit by a pitch leading off and Ike Davis, who struck out in all four at-bats Friday, singled for his second hit in 43 at-bats.	But Ruben Tejada popped up a sacrifice bunt try and pinch-hitter Justin Turner grounded into a double play that ended it.	The Braves' previous suspended game was April 5, 1997, against the Cubs -- it was the second game ever played at Turner Field and was stopped because of rain in the seventh inning. Atlanta won the resumption the next day.	The Mets lost in their first suspended game since Aug. 6, 1986, when the second game of a doubleheader against the Cubs was halted after the seventh for darkness -- Wrigley Field didn't have lights then. The Mets won the completion the next day.	When the Mets took the field Saturday, the public-address announcer said Bobby Parnell was now pitching for New York. Greg Burke finished out the eighth Friday night while reliever Robert Carson warmed up.	The Braves took a 5-3 lead in the eighth on a two-run single by pinch-hitter Evan Gattis. The Mets evened it in the bottom half against Varvaro, who struggled to get a good grip but threw a wild pitch that let the tying run score.	The game was suspended after a 75-minute delay. The start was delayed by rain for 16 minutes.	Uggla hit a solo homer in the Atlanta seventh that made it 3-all. Buck had also connected.	Game notes	 Gonzalez said RHP Brandon Beachy (Tommy John surgery in 2012) is "progressing well." Beachy pitched four innings and gave up two runs Friday night in a Triple-A rehab start. ... Atlanta RHP Jordan Walden (shoulder inflammation) threw a side session Friday and will have another one Sunday. ... The clubs combined TV crews to show the resumption, with Mets announcer Keith Hernandez working with Braves broadcaster Joe Simpson. The regularly scheduled game was a Fox national game.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

TORONTO --  For Adam Jones, there's nothing like a trip north of the border to pad those power stats.	Jones hit a towering home run, Danny Valencia also went deep and the Baltimore Orioles beat R.A. Dickey and the Toronto Blue Jays 6-5 on Saturday.	Jones has eight home runs at Rogers Centre since the start of the 2012 season, the most by any opposing player.	"I just see the ball good here," Jones said. "I don't think it's anything in particular. It's just baseball. Crazy things happen."	Baltimore leads the majors with 68 home runs this season, including nine in the past three games.	"They've got a good-hitting club, one of the best in baseball," Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. "It's no secret why they're a good team."	The Orioles won for the fourth time in five games following a season-long, six-game losing streak.	Freddy Garcia (1-2) allowed three runs and nine hits in five innings to win for the first time since Aug. 15, 2012, when he beat Texas while pitching for the New York Yankees. Garcia walked none and struck out one.	"In the third, fourth and fifth innings I had a better feel for the ball and I pitched better," Garcia said.	Steve Johnson struck out five in 2 2/3 innings, Darren O'Day got one out and Jim Johnson closed it out in the ninth for his 15th save in 18 chances, snapping a streak of three straight blown saves. Jim Johnson's save was his first since May 10 at Minnesota.	"Once again, Jim Johnson closing a one-run lead on the road in the American League East against a team as hot as anybody," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. "That's pretty impressive."	Valencia connected off Dickey with a second-deck drive in the third inning, his second home run of the season -- both in the past two days. Jones chased last year's NL Cy Young Award winner with an even longer drive in the seventh, his ninth of the year and third in three games.	The homers were the 10th and 11th allowed by Dickey this season, tying him with four pitchers, including teammates Mark Buehrle and Brandon Morrow, for second-most in the AL.	"We have a team that can drive the ball out of the park," Jones said. "We score in a lot of unique ways."	Dickey (4-6), who won his previous two starts, matched his loss total from last season with the New York Mets. He allowed six runs and nine hits in 6 2/3 innings, walked three and struck out four.	"I'm kind of just punching the clock right now," Dickey said. "I'm searching for it. The journey is always ongoing but I certainly haven't felt like I did last year. There's some concrete reasons for that and there's some reasons I need to iron out in the bullpen in between outings.	"I've just been battling some injuries and pitching through some things," he added. "My velocity hasn't been there this year so far. I haven't been able to go to the harder knuckleball."	Pitching with the roof open on a cool, gusty afternoon didn't make things any easier on Dickey.	"It wasn't ideal conditions but it was OK," he said. "I've pitched just fine in conditions similar to today. That's certainly not an excuse."	Would he have preferred the retractable roof be closed?	"It's hard," he said. "They know what I like and it's up to them to make that decision, you know?"	After Melky Cabrera made a running catch at the wall to retire Jones and strand two runners in the fourth, Dickey retired the next eight in a row before Jones took him deep.	"He's a special breed and they're lucky to have him," Showalter said of Dickey. "If they get tired of him, pass him our way."	Chris Davis hit an RBI double and J.J. Hardy added a two-run single as the Orioles took a 3-0 lead in the first. Baltimore has led 3-0 in all three games of this series, winning twice.	"It makes it tough," Blue Jays designated hitter Adam Lind said of the early deficits. "You know you've got to start to climb that mountain from our first at-bat."	Lind got Toronto started on that climb with an RBI single in the first and Emilio Bonifacio cut it to 3-2 with a one-out homer in the second, his second.	Valencia's two-run homer made it 5-2, but Toronto got one back in the fifth when Garcia made a throwing error on Brett Lawrie's grounder, allowing Jose Bautista to score from third.	Jones made it 6-3 with a two-out shot in the seventh, but the Blue Jays rallied with two in the eighth. Steve Johnson left after giving up an RBI single to Munenori Kawasaki, and Cabrera drove in Toronto's fifth run with a single off O'Day.	"We made a run at it, we just came up short," Gibbons said.	Game notes	 Davis has 57 hits this season, 33 for extra bases. ... Orioles RF Nick Markakis extended his hitting streak to 10 games with a single in the fourth. ... Blue Jays RHP Josh Johnson (sore triceps) allowed one hit over four scoreless innings in a rehab start at Triple-A Buffalo. He is expected to make one more rehab start before rejoining the Blue Jays. ... Toronto recalled RHP Thad Weber from Buffalo to replace LHP Sean Nolin, who was sent back to Double-A after making his major league debut in Friday's 10-6 loss. ... Baltimore placed RHP Pedro Strop (lower back strain) on the 15-day DL and recalled Steve Johnson from Triple-A Norfolk.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

BOSTON -- The Red Sox and Indians exchanged nearly as many mistakes as runs for seven innings before a string of clutch hits and a friendly gust of wind helped Boston build the decisive rally.	Pinch-hitter Mike Carp drove in the tying run with an eighth-inning double and then scored on a double by Dustin Pedroia to lead the Red Sox past Cleveland 7-4 on Saturday.	Trailing 4-3 entering the bottom of the eighth, Boston scored four times off reliever Vinnie Pestano (1-1) to open the largest lead in a game that featured plenty of chances at the plate but little success for either club.	"It's big," said Carp, who broke out of an 0-for-21 skid on Friday night with a three-run homer in Boston's 8-1 win. "I was in a little bit of a slump. To be able to come out of that and win the ballgame, it means a lot."	Pedro Ciriaco had three hits, including a one-out double that started Boston's rally in the eighth. After Pestano struck out Jacoby Ellsbury for the second out, Carp batted for Jonny Gomes and lifted a first-pitch fastball to left for a double that easily scored Ciriaco.	Pedroia followed with a shot high off the Green Monster, giving Boston its first lead of the game.	"This was a very good team win and we got contributions from a lot of guys," manager John Farrell said.	After Pedroia's hit, the Indians walked David Ortiz intentionally and Mike Napoli followed with a walk to load the bases. Daniel Nava hit a high popup to shallow left field, but the blustery wind turned a routine out into a bloop single and two RBIs.	"There were a couple of balls that were Fenway fly balls. I think the wind plays a factor, and The Wall. There's a lot of things going on out there. That's just a part of this ballpark," said Cleveland manager Terry Francona, who spent eight seasons in Boston. "The wind brought it back 20 feet and it ends up being in no-man's land."	Junichi Tazawa (4-2) struck out two in a hitless eighth and Andrew Bailey got three outs for his sixth save in seven chances.	Boston starter Jon Lester struck out a season-high eight in seven innings. He also hit a batter with a pitch as Cleveland scored twice to take a 3-1 lead in the third, then threw a costly wild pitch in the seventh.	Mike Aviles and Asdrubal Cabrera hit back-to-back singles in the seventh, then Lester allowed the go-ahead run with a wild pitch to Mark Reynolds that skipped past catcher David Ross. Lester ended up striking out, but Cleveland had regained the lead at 4-3.	"It didn't even make it to the plate. I didn't even give Rossy a chance to block it," Lester said. "I was on the same page as him, just trying to bury a curveball."	Cabrera had three hits, stole two bases, drove in a run and scored another for the Indians, who lost for the fourth time in five games. Nick Swisher added an RBI double and Carlos Santana a run-scoring single.	Scott Kazmir pitched five innings and struck out six for Cleveland. He gave up two runs, five hits and four walks.	"I thought he had to dodge traffic all day and make some really big pitches. They made him work from the first inning on, but he continued to make pitches," Francona said. "As a team today we just gave them extra opportunities and they took advantage."	Ciriaco had an RBI single in the second and Gomes' sacrifice fly tied it at 3 in the sixth after an error by Reynolds at third base. Jose Iglesias singled and Ciriaco followed with a bunt that Reynolds barehanded cleanly, but he rushed his throw and the ball skipped out of play, allowing both runners to advance.	Game notes	The four-game series concludes Sunday with Cleveland RHP Corey Kluber (2-3) facing LHP Felix Doubront (3-2). ... SS Stephen Drew sat out for Boston, still sore from a slide he made last weekend in Minnesota, Farrell said. ... Francona said before the game he was thankful general manager Chris Antonetti traveled with the club as Francona made his return to Boston, where he managed the Red Sox for eight seasons and won two World Series titles. "It meant a lot to me," said Francona, who was welcomed back with a standing ovation Thursday night in the series opener. "I know he came up for moral support because I had some anxiety." ... Cleveland DH Jason Giambi, hitless in his last 26 at-bats, did not play.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Billy Buckner needed to jog his memory to recall his previous major league win.	"It's been a while," he said. "The Cubs, my last outing in 2009."	Right on the money.	Josh Hamilton and Hank Conger homered to back Buckner's first victory in 3½ years, and the Los Angeles Angels beat the Kansas City Royals 7-0 on Saturday for their seventh straight victory.	The resurgent Angels have outscored opponents 54-18 during their longest winning streak of the season.	"It hasn't changed the expectations at all," manager Mike Scioscia said. "Obviously, confidence as a team builds as you start to move in the right direction. Right now these guys feel good because we're playing the type of baseball we had hoped we would play the first month, but it didn't appear.	"It's here now. I think you see guys are comfortable playing our game, and let the other team try to stop us. That's the mode we want to get into when we're at our best."	The Angels lost 22 of their first 33 games this season, but the winning streak has moved them into third place in the AL West.	"I kind of look at that as we're not done yet," Conger said. "We've won a lot. We've got things rolling, but you look at the big picture. We really need to continue this momentum in order to be in the position we want to be later on down the road."	The slumping Royals have lost 15 of 19, including seven straight at home. They have scored three runs or fewer in 12 of those defeats to drop a season-low four games below .500 at 21-25.	"We're just not getting it done right now," center fielder Lorenzo Cain said. "We've got to step up and start doing better. Offensively, we're struggling big-time. It's frustrating. We have a very talented lineup.  It doesn't feel like we should be struggling this bad. We've just got to find a way to score runs."	Conger's opposite-field shot leading off the sixth inning was the first hit off Jeremy Guthrie, who dropped his third consecutive outing after going a Royals-record 18 starts in a row without a loss.	Hamilton homered with two outs in the seventh to make it 3-0, his 900th career hit. He has five RBIs in his past five games after driving in only four runs during his previous 32.	"He still hasn't hit his stride," Scioscia said.	Buckner (1-0), who hadn't pitched in the majors since 2010, limited the Royals to two hits over five innings. He walked three, struck out two and threw a pair of wild pitches. His previous victory came on Oct. 2, 2009, for the Arizona Diamondbacks against the Chicago Cubs.	The Royals drafted Buckner in the second round in 2004 and he got his first big league victory with them in 2007.	"Full circle, right back here where it all started," Buckner said. "Getting any win at this point was going to feel good. It is neat to come back to the park where it first started."	Mark Trumbo hit a two-run single in the Angels' four-run eighth. Mike Trout had an RBI single and scored twice, the fifth straight game in which he has scored a pair of runs.	Los Angeles relievers Dane De La Rosa, Scott Downs, Robert Coello and Michael Kohn held Kansas City to two hits over four innings to complete the four-hitter.	Guthrie (5-3) gave up only one hit in the first six innings but faded badly after that. He was charged with seven runs, six earned, on five hits, two hit batters and a walk in 7 1/3 innings.	"I executed better today," Guthrie said. "It came unraveled in the eighth. We couldn't seem to make a play and things didn't work out for us."	The right-hander allowed an unearned run in the fourth when Trout walked, stole second, advanced to third on catcher George Kottaras' throwing error and scored on Albert Pujols' groundout.	After Billy Butler led off the Royals second with a walk, Eric Hosmer bunted him over. It was the first sacrifice bunt in Hosmer's professional career, which began in 2008.	The Royals threatened in the fifth when Mike Moustakas doubled with one out, went to third on a wild pitch and Kottaras walked. Buckner got out of that jam when Chris Getz rolled into a double play.	Game notes	 After the game, the Royals placed C Salvador Perez on the bereavement list following the death of his grandmother. C Adam Moore was called up from Triple-A Omaha. ... Getz was ejected in the sixth by first base umpire Marty Foster, his second career ejection. ... Royals pitching coach Dave Eiland was absent while attending his daughter's confirmation in Florida. He will return Monday. ... Angels RHP Kevin Jepsen threw a scoreless inning Friday in his second rehab appearance for Triple-A Salt Lake. Jepsen went on the disabled list with a right shoulder strain on April 13 after compiling a 9.82 ERA in six relief appearances.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Angel Pagan was thinking triple out of the box. Once he rounded second and saw third base coach Tim Flannery waving him home, he shifted into another gear.	Pagan became the first San Francisco player to end a game with an inside-the-park homer, connecting with a runner aboard in the bottom of the 10th inning Saturday to give the Giants a thrilling 6-5 victory over the Colorado Rockies.	"I know two things: I'm going to score and Flannery is going to score with me," Pagan said. "He's amazing. I'll be honest with you, I was running out of gas a little bit around third. He helped me to get there."	Troy Tulowitzki homered leading off the 10th to put the Rockies ahead 5-4, but Colorado closer Rafael Betancourt (1-2) walked Brandon Crawford to open the bottom half.	Guillermo Quiroz sacrificed before Pagan sent a long drive that hit the base of the oddly angled wall in right-center and bounced high over the head of right fielder Michael Cuddyer. The ball caromed away from Cuddyer as the speedy Pagan raced around the bases and slid home ahead of the relay.	"I was thinking at least three. I was watching the ball and it didn't bounce too far from him," Pagan said. "I'm thinking three but looking at the coach. He gives me the OK and I'm going for it."	The last major leaguer to hit an inside-the-park home run that ended a game was Rey Sanchez for Tampa Bay on June 11, 2004 -- also in a 10-inning victory over Colorado, according to STATS.	The previous Giants player to do it was Hall of Famer Bill Terry on Aug. 24, 1931, when the club was in New York. His drive beat the Chicago Cubs 2-1, STATS said.	"I thought it was going over the fence," said Pagan's teammate, Hunter Pence. "Inside the park is the last thing you think of. All we could do is watch him run and hope he was safe."	It was Betancourt's first blown save in 11 chances this season.	Carlos Gonzalez homered among his three hits and drove in two runs for the Rockies. Cuddyer and Jordan Pacheco also drove in runs.	Buster Posey had three hits and scored twice for the Giants, who ended a four-game slide against the Rockies. Pence, Andres Torres and Marco Scutaro each drove in runs. Crawford and Pablo Sandoval had two hits apiece.	"That would have been a tough one to lose," San Francisco manager Bruce Bochy said. "That was an emotional roller-coaster ride. We had a couple of critical calls go against us, but it's all about bouncing back and these guys found a way."	Bochy watched the game-winning hit from his office. He had been ejected in the eighth inning.	"I've never seen that before," Bochy said. "I wish I could have been out there."	Giants closer Sergio Romo (3-2) gave up Tulowitzki's 10th homer.	"To go up and then lose the game is tough," Tulowitzki said. "But then we know the Giants play well in front of their fans and feel like they can win these kinds of games."	Rockies starter Juan Nicasio went five-plus innings, allowing two runs and seven hits. He walked one and struck out two.	Barry Zito lasted six innings, giving up four runs and seven hits. He walked one and struck out three.	Bochy was ejected in the bottom of the eighth by plate umpire Alfonso Marquez for arguing a call at third base after Scutaro appeared to dodge Nolan Arenado's tag on a throw from the outfield.	Marquez called Brandon Belt out at home on a close play in the seventh.	Pence's RBI double in the sixth ended San Francisco's 24-inning scoreless streak against Colorado pitching. Crawford's sacrifice fly and Scutaro's bases-loaded walk brought the Giants within 4-3.	Torres tied the game with a double in the seventh.	Dexter Fowler opened the game with a double and, one out later, Gonzalez hit the first pitch into McCovey Cove beyond the right-field wall.	The Rockies added a pair of runs in the fourth on consecutive doubles from Tulowitzki and Cuddyer, and a one-out single by Pacheco.	"It was a well-played game," Colorado manager Walt Weiss said. "The walks hurt us. You don't think about it when the ball comes off the bat, but with the configurations of the park, it can bounce anywhere."	Cuddyer has three hits -- all for extra bases -- and four RBIs in his two games back from the disabled list.	The Giants loaded the bases in the first inning but failed to score. Nicasio retired 13 of his next 16 hitters, twice stranding runners in scoring position.	Gonzalez became the first Rockies player to have a "splash hit" into McCovey Cove. It was the 27th splash hit by an opponent and the 90th overall since the ballpark opened in 2000. ... The Giants played their major league-leading ninth extra-inning game. ... Centerplate, Inc. concession workers went on a one-day strike, picketing in front of the ballpark. Concessions were staffed by management and others. ... Bochy said a decision on Tuesday's starter, to replace injured RHP Ryan Vogelsong, will be made by Sunday. ... Rockies RHP Jon Garland (3-5, 5.19 ERA) pitches Sunday's series finale. He last faced the Giants on Sept. 9, 2010. ... Tulowitzki extended his hitting streak to 10 games. ... RHP Matt Cain (3-2, 5.12) starts Sunday for the Giants. He will be facing the Rockies for the 30th time.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

DETROIT -- Joe Mauer provided the early power, and P.J. Walters gave Minnesota the start it needed on the mound.	Now the Twins can finally move on after an ugly 10-game losing streak.	Mauer homered and had three hits, and the Twins snapped their skid with a 3-2 win over the Detroit Tigers on Saturday. Walters was solid in his first major league appearance of the season. He was called up from the minors before the game.	"It feels good to get out from under that 10-gamer," said Twins manager Ron Gardenhire, who was ejected in the third inning. "We got out to a quick start, and then we had to hold on for a long time against a really good team. That's not an easy lineup to shut down, but P.J. did a great job. He got us deep enough and then our bullpen finished it off."	Mauer had already earned the ire of Detroit fans when he broke up Anibal Sanchez's no-hit bid in the ninth inning Friday night. He was booed when came to bat in the first inning Saturday -- then booed some more after his solo homer to right field.	The Twins scored three runs in the first, and that was enough. Walters (1-0) went six innings, allowing two runs and eight hits.	Mauer had two singles to go along with his homer.	"Mauer is Mauer," Detroit catcher Brayan Pena said. "Sometimes you make great pitches to him, and he still can hit you."	Four relievers finished for the Twins, with Glen Perkins pitching the ninth for his ninth save in 10 chances.	Detroit's Doug Fister (5-2) allowed three runs and eight hits in seven innings. Jhonny Peralta homered for the Tigers.	Gardenhire was ejected while arguing a call in the third inning.	Mauer's first-inning drive was ruled a homer, then reviewed because the ball bounced back into the field of play. A replay showed it hit the top of the wall in right, but may have also glanced off a railing above the wall. The call stood.	The Twins weren't done. After being shut down in Sanchez's one-hitter the previous evening, they broke through right away against Fister. Justin Morneau's RBI double made it 2-0, and he came in to score on Chris Parmelee's single.	Walters got out of a jam in the second when Andy Dirks struck out with the bases loaded.	The following inning, Gardenhire was ejected. The Twins had men on first and second with nobody out when Morneau hit a grounder to first baseman Prince Fielder. He threw to second, and the Tigers turned a double play -- but Mauer, who had advanced to third on the play, was sent back to second because of an interference call. Josh Willingham had gone sliding into Peralta, the shortstop.	Gardenhire came out to argue and was thrown out of the game by second base umpire Joe West.	"His call was that he slid too close to the bag or something. He told me that he was protecting the defender, just like he had always protected me when I was playing," Gardenhire said. "I said `Joe, I didn't play that much."	Detroit's Miguel Cabrera extended his hitting streak to 11 games with a first-inning single, but that was his only hit. Torii Hunter got the Tigers on the board in the fifth with an RBI double, but Cabrera struck out to end that inning.	Peralta made it a one-run game in the sixth with his fifth homer of the year.	"It was just location. I was able to keep the ball down on almost every pitch, and that's huge against that lineup," said Walters, who was making his first major league appearance of the season. "I got one pitch up to Torii, and I got another one up on the homer, but those were the only big mistakes."	Twins center fielder Wilkin Ramirez left the game after a scary collision on a fly ball. Omar Infante lifted a fly to left-center in the sixth, and left fielder Josh Willingham was under it when Ramirez came speeding over to try to make the play. Ramirez did catch the ball, holding onto it for the third out after colliding with Willingham.	Ramirez remained down on the ground well into the break between innings. He was finally able to walk off under his own power, but when he got back to the dugout, he appeared to be flexing his jaw.	The Tigers honored their 1968 World Series-winning team before the game. ... It was the 64th ejection of Gardenhire's career and second this season. ... Fister struck out seven and walked one. ... Minnesota's Chris Colabello had a sixth-inning single -- his first major league hit. ... Detroit's Max Scherzer (6-0) takes the mound in Sunday's series finale against Minnesota's Mike Pelfrey (3-4).	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MILWAUKEE -- Jeff Locke put up some more zeroes for Pittsburgh.	The Pirates lefthander didn't give up a run for the second straight game to help lead the Pittsburgh Pirates to a 5-2 win over the Milwaukee Brewers on Saturday.	Locke (5-1)allowed three hits in six scoreless innings and struck out a season-high seven, after seven shutout innings against Houston.	"You're seeing him grow up before your eyes," Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said.	Hurdle said he was most impressed with the fact that Locke did not have his best stuff against the Brewers, but still held the potent lineup scoreless with his inside fastball. It was Locke's fourth straight win and he has allowed three or fewer earned runs in each of his past seven starts.	"To be able to maneuver through that lineup without his best stuff is something," Hurdle said. "He is getting a little better every day. This has to be a big boost to his confidence."	Locke credited a sixth-inning double play started by Pirates third baseman Pedro Alvarez as one of the keys to his success Saturday.	"I was attacking them today and trying to stay efficient," he said. "It's nice to come into this ballpark and win a game. We've had some trouble here in the past."	The Pirates won for a second time in Milwaukee this season, but for only the ninth time since 2007 at Miller Park -- against 47 losses.	Brewers centerfielder Carlos Gomez, who hit two home runs after Locke had left the game, said he was very impressed with the pitcher.	"That kid has good stuff. He doesn't miss many pitches," Gomez said. "You have to tip your hat to the good job he did today. That kid is going to be one that people talk a lot about in the future."	Locke received plenty of offensive support, including two home runs from Alvarez and solo shots by Andrew McCutchen and Neil Walker.	Alvarez hit two long home runs to right field, prompting Hurdle to say he hoped the performance would boost Alvarez to go on a hot streak.	"I'm trying to keep it simple and put a good swing on the ball," Alvarez said. "We just want to go out and compete and if we do that, I know that we'll be successful."	Mike Fiers (1-3), starting in place of Kyle Lohse (elbow) for Milwaukee, lasted four innings, giving up four runs and five hits.	"When I fell behind, they made me pay," Fiers said.	Milwaukee is 5-17 in May and has not won back-to-back games since April 29-30 at home against Pittsburgh.	The Pirates grabbed a 1-0 lead in the first inning as McCutchen hit his seventh home run. It was McCutchen's fourth home run off Fiers during his career and his third straight at-bat against Fiers in which he hit a home run.	Pittsburgh increased its lead to 3-0 in the second inning on a two-run shot by Alvarez and Walker hit a solo homer in the fourth.	Gomez hit his seventh home run of the year leading off the seventh inning off Pirates reliever Justin Wilson to cut Pittsburgh's lead to 4-1.	Alvarez added his 10th leading off the ninth inning, a towering shot to the top of the second level in right field.	Gomez hit his second home run of the game in the ninth inning to trim the lead to 5-2. It was Gomez's first career multi-home run game.	Game notes	Brewers closer Jim Henderson was to see a doctor Saturday and will be out "a while," Brewers manager Ron Roenicke said. Henderson injured his right hamstring Friday while delivering a pitch that led to the second out in the ninth inning. He gave way to Francisco Rodriguez who earned a save in the Brewers' 2-1 win ... Pirates infielder John McDonald who was put on the 15-day disabled list May 15 with a lower back strain, will begin a minor league rehab assignment Monday at Triple A Indianapolis ... Brewers RHP Yovani Gallardo (3-4) will face Pirates LHP Wandy Rodriguez (5-2) in the series finale Sunday.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CINCINNATI -- Dusty Baker doesn't like the suicide squeeze bunt -- too many things can go wrong. The way things are going for the Cincinnati Reds these days, he needn't worry.	The Reds used another big inning -- one featuring a perfectly executed squeeze -- to beat the Chicago Cubs 5-2 on Sunday for their fifth win in a row. Todd Frazier drove in a pair of runs with a sacrifice fly and a single, and Derrick Robinson pulled off the bunt that put the Reds ahead to stay.	"Just an outstanding inning," Baker said.	Just one inning to an outstanding start.	The Reds have won 13 of their last 16 games, surging to 31-18. It's their best start since 1995, when they reached the NL Championship Series and got swept by Atlanta.	"This team has some big boys, veterans out on the field, and their pitching is some of the best in baseball," Cubs manager Dale Sveum said. "It's tough to score on them. We're in all the games, but you can't add on or score on their bullpen."	Cincinnati scored four times in the sixth off left-hander Travis Wood (4-3), extending its domination of the NL Central's last-place team. Chicago has lost a season-high six straight games.	Homer Bailey (3-3) gave up a pair of runs in six innings to a lineup that rarely has a big inning. Aroldis Chapman had a perfect ninth for his 12th save in 14 chances, hitting 100 mph with one pitch that sailed to the backstop.	The Reds won the first two games of the series in front of sell-out crowds. They've dominated the Cubs lately, winning 16 of their last 18 games in the series. The Reds are 19-5 against the Cubs over the last two seasons, including 7-1 this year.	Cincinnati won the series opener 7-4 on Friday with a five-run fourth inning that featured Ryan Hanigan's three-run homer. The catcher doubled home a run during Cincinnati's four-run sixth inning on Saturday.	The Reds didn't need any homers to pull away. Instead, they sent nine batters to the plate to stop Wood's impressive streak. The left-hander had nine quality starts to open the season, the best such streak by a Cubs pitcher since Mordecai Brown had 11 in 1908, the last time they won the World Series.	Frazier's RBI single tied it at 2, and the Reds pulled off that suicide squeeze to take the lead. Brandon Phillips was on third when Robinson swung at the first pitch but failed to put the ball in play, then got the sign for the bunt.	"That's part of my game," said Robinson, who practices it every day. "I was kind of expecting it. We'd talked about it in the past. That was the perfect situation for it there."	Baker thought so, too.	"I'm not crazy about it," the manager said. "It's taking a heck of a chance. A lot of bad stuff can happen. He executed it perfectly. Brandon left on time."	The run put Bailey in line for the win. Hanigan's double made it 4-2, and Cesar Izturis drove him home with a pinch-hit single.	"We have a good offense," said Bailey, who gave up five hits and two runs in six innings. "They picked me up today. They'll do that more times than not. I didn't think they were going to hold us to two runs."	Phillips had a single that extended his streak to 12 games. Joey Votto went 0 for 3, ending his season-best streak at 12 games.	Anthony Rizzo snapped an 0-for-22 slump with an RBI double in the second inning, slapping his hands when he reached second base. Rizzo scored on Alfonso Soriano's single for a 2-0 lead.	The Reds traded Wood to the Cubs in December 2011 as part of a package for reliever Sean Marshall, who went on the disabled list with a sore shoulder before the start of the series. The 26-year-old Wood finished last season strong and had kept it up. He couldn't beat his former team, falling to 0-2 in four starts against the Reds.	The Reds got a scare in the second inning when right fielder Jay Bruce and center fielder Shin-Soo Choo banged shoulders and fell to the warning track while chasing Welington Castillo's fly ball. Choo caught it and held on, and neither player was hurt.	The Reds went 31-17 in 1995. ... Cincinnati's Johnny Cueto makes his second start since returning from the DL in the series finale Sunday. He'll face Matt Garza, also making his second start since returning from the DL. ... Rizzo also singled to center in the fifth, but Choo threw him out as he tried to stretch it to a double. ... The Reds had homered in each of their last nine games. ... The Cubs ended their streak of four straight games with an error.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Lyle Overbay made the biggest in a series of big plays Saturday that showed why the New York Yankees are on top in the AL East.	Overbay homered with two outs in the 11th inning, and the Yankees rallied late to beat the Tampa Bay Rays 4-3 on Saturday.	"He's a big reason why we are where we're at," said New York manager Joe Girardi of Overbay, who is filling in for the injured Mark Teixeira. "It's a big home run. It's a big win."	Overbay drilled a 1-0 pitch from Josh Lueke (0-2) into the right-field seats to give New York the lead.	"I'd been missing fastballs all day, and it was good just to get on top of one," Overbay said. "Exciting to do that."	Ivan Nova (2-1), who made his first relief appearance after returning from a right triceps injury and being moved from the Yankees' rotation to the bullpen, struck out James Loney and got an inning-ending grounder from Matt Joyce with the bases loaded in the 10th.	"I've got to take advantage of every opportunity," Nova said.	Mariano Rivera pitched a perfect 11th inning for his 18th straight save to start the season. The right-hander tied Dennis Eckersley for fourth place for games pitched with 1,071. He had been tied with Hoyt Wilhelm, who coached Rivera in the minors.	"I think that's why we appreciate him so much because of his consistency year in and year out," Girardi said.	The Yankees scored twice in the ninth against struggling Tampa Bay closer Fernando Rodney to pull even at 3.	With two outs, Overbay walked, went to second on a balk, and scored on Brennan Boesch's pinch-hit RBI double. Brett Gardner then added a run-scoring single.	Gardner was caught attempting to steal second with Robinson Cano batting.	"When we tied it, you've got to feel good about your chances," Gardner said. "The momentum is on our side, but we're still playing on the road and they've got the last shot at it. Another outstanding pitching performance today, and we were able to steal one."	Rodney is just 9 for 14 in save chances this year after converting 48 of 50 opportunities last season.	"This has been really awkward to watch," Rays manager Joe Maddon said. "He's been within one pitch of almost being perfect this season. Three of the blown saves have come down to the last pitch. I've not lost any patience with it. As long as he doesn't lose confidence in himself, I will not lose confidence in him."	Tampa Bay appeared poised to win it in the bottom of the ninth, but Ichiro Suzuki made a sliding catch in right field on Yunel Escobar's liner with a runner on second.	"Amazing," Girardi said. "I heard some people in the stands, say 'There it is.' They thought the game was over. There's so many big things that happened in this game to give us an opportunity to win that game."	Rays starter Matt Moore, looking to start the season 9-0, got a no-decision despite allowing one run and five hits in six innings. In his other start against New York this season, the left-hander gave up one run and two hits over eight innings on April 22 in a 5-1 victory.	Yankees rookie Vidal Nuno allowed two runs and five hits over six-plus innings. The left-hander, making his second start and fourth appearance, has given up three runs in 14 innings overall.	Loney singled off Nuno to start the seventh and went to third when Joyce had a pinch-hit double against Shawn Kelley. Kelly Johnson then put Tampa Bay up 2-1 on a single off Boone Logan.	The Rays' advantage grew to 3-1 when Joyce slid home safely under catcher Austin Romine's tag attempt after Escobar hit a grounder to shortstop Jayson Nix.	Johnson has driven in 18 runs over his 20 games this month.	The Yankees took a 1-0 lead in the first when Gardner had a leadoff double and scored on a two-out single by Travis Hafner.	Tampa Bay tied it at 1 on Desmond Jennings' two-out RBI double during the fifth.	Game notes	The Yankees are 2-17 when trailing after eight innings. ... Tampa Bay Buccaneers Pro Bowl defensive tackle Gerald McCoy was scheduled to throw the ceremonial first pitch, but was delayed getting to the ballpark due to a minor vehicle accident in which no one was injured. ... Nix was spiked and cut near the right wrist on a seventh-inning pickoff play. He remained in the game and stole second on the next pitch. ... The Yankees put OF Curtis Granderson on the 15-day disabled list with a broken knuckle on his left pinkie and recalled Boesch from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO -- Jake Peavy got some help from Conor Gillaspie in finishing off the Florida Marlins.	Gillaspie hit a run-scoring single in the ninth inning, lifting the White Sox to a 2-1 win over the Marlins on Saturday night.	Peavy (6-2) struck out five and allowed six hits in a complete game, but Derek Dietrich homered with one out in the ninth to tie the game and spoil the shutout bid.	That didn't stop the White Sox, who have won eight of 11 and, at 23-24, are their closest to .500 since April 17, when they were 7-8.	"For us to come back and win in the (ninth) was special," Peavy said. "That's the White Sox way. Nothing's easy around here, is it?"	Through eight innings, Peavy was making it look easy.	Facing a Miami team that entered play hitting .221, Peavy wasn't hassled much. In the second he got a double play with no outs to help him get out of the inning. In the eighth Peavy allowed a one-out double to Greg Dobbs and walked Adeiny Hechavarria but escaped the inning by getting Rob Brantly to pop out and Juan Pierre to fly out.	Other than that, there wasn't much from the Miami offense until Dietrich's homer.	"He pitched great," White Sox manager Robin Ventura said.	Alexei Ramirez gave Chicago a 1-0 lead with an RBI double in the third. Pierre mishandled the ball in the left field corner -- but wasn't charged with an error -- allowing Alejandro De Aza to score from first.	Thanks to Peavy, however, that lone run was all the White Sox needed until the ninth.	Ricky Nolasco allowed one run and eight hits and struck out six in 7 2/3 innings for Miami but couldn't earn his second consecutive win after beating Arizona on May 19. The Marlins right-hander has allowed two runs over his last two starts and kept the White Sox in check.	It wasn't good enough for the win, however.	Wise, who entered as a defensive replacement for Dayan Viciedo in the top of the ninth, led off with a double off Ryan Webb (1-3). He streaked home on Gillaspie's single to left, scoring easily ahead of a throw from Pierre.	Alex Rios went 0 for 4, ending his career-high hitting streak at 18 games, but Gillaspie had three hits for the White Sox, while Jeff Keppinger and Ramirez also had two.	"Baseball is such a funny game because everybody feeds off each other," Gillaspie said. "We went through some pretty rough times the first half of the season. It's good to kind of get everybody on the same page. Everybody's excited. You can feel it in the clubhouse."	Miami is going through some rough times now, to say the least.	The Marlins have dropped 11 of their last 13 and have sunk to 13-36, the worst record in the major leagues. They've lost four straight and are in danger of being swept Sunday.	After Dietrich's home run, it appeared the Marlins were headed in the right direction. The drive tied the game and extended Dietrich's streak of reaching base to 14 games, the second-longest streak for any Marlin to start his career behind Kevin Millar's 17 in 1999.	"We finally get a big hit, Dietrich does. Great swing. Great at-bat. He crushed that ball," Marlins manager Mike Redmond said. "I was thinking the momentum is switching to our side and then they come back on four pitches and win the ballgame."	The loss was the second straight one-run defeat for Miami, which is 6-13 in one-run games this year.	"Obviously that's not the way we wanted to go out," Webb said. "It sucks losing two games in a row like that."	Game notes	White Sox LHP Chris Sale, who was scratched from his start Wednesday, played catch off flat ground Saturday. He's expected to throw a bullpen session Sunday and start Tuesday. . Marlins RHP Nathan Eovaldi pitched five innings and struck out five in a rehab start at Class-A Jupiter. Eovaldi hasn't pitched in the majors this season after going on the DL with right shoulder inflammation. ... John Danks, who made his first start for the White Sox in over a year Friday night, said his left shoulder felt good one day after throwing 76 pitches. ... Redmond said 2B Donovan Solano, who was placed on the DL May 7 with a left intercostal strain, will be sent to extended spring training Monday. ... INF Angel Sanchez was outrighted to Triple-A Charlotte after being reinstated from a rehab assignment for lower back spasms. The move clears a spot on Chicago's 40-man roster. ... Chicago's Hector Gimenez started in place of Tyler Flowers for the second straight night. Flowers also missed Friday with back spasms. ... Sunday's pitching matchup is Miami's Alex Sanabia (3-6, 4.56 ERA) against Chicago's Dylan Axelrod (2-3, 4.13).	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

Athletics 11, Astros 5. New approach.	HOUSTON --  One night after Chris Young broke out of a slump, Josh Donaldson had a big night of his own.	Donaldson had four hits and the Oakland Athletics beat the Houston Astros 11-5 Saturday night.	"My goal every day is to go out there and put good at-bats together," Donaldson said. "The last two games or so I have felt a little bit more overaggressive. I was trying to be a little more patient tonight and get a good pitch to hit. They fell behind me a couple times, and I was able to get a pitch to hit."	Donaldson said he and hitting coach Chili Davis worked on a few things before the game. He tied a career-high with four hits and was a triple shy of the cycle.	"He went through one little period where he was down some, but he's been consistent all year on base every time tonight and getting good swings almost every single time," Oakland manager Bob Melvin said. "There's a reason he's hitting in the middle of the order for us."	Chris Young had three hits and drove in two as Oakland's bats came alive for a season-high 18 hits, and the A's scored their most runs in a month. Every Oakland hitter drove in at least one run. Brandon Moss had a home run as well for the A's, who improved to 8-0 this season against the Astros.	A's starter A.J. Griffin (5-3) allowed four runs on five hits with seven strikeouts in 5 2/3 innings. He gave up three home runs.	"Other than the home runs, I felt all right," Griffin said. "Those home runs happen, so obviously, you have a little bitter taste in your mouth at the end of the day. I made it 5 2-3, and I always would like to make it 6, 7, 8. It was a great team win. I just tried to keep us in the game and keep making pitches."	Jason Castro and Matt Dominguez each belted two home runs for the Astros. It was the first time two Houston teammates have had multi-home run games since July 25, 2005, when Craig Biggio and Lance Berkman each had two.	After Castro gave the Astros a 1-0 lead in the first with a two-out solo home run to right, Oakland responded with six runs in the second, sending 12 batters to the plate.	Seth Smith and Donaldson led off with back-to-back singles before Moss walked to load the bases. Young laced a two-run double off the wall in left, and Eric Sogard followed with an RBI single to make it 3-1. Adam Rosales grounded out to shortstop to extend the lead to 4-1.	Coco Crisp upped the lead to 5-1 with a run-scoring single. Yoenis Cespedes walked with two outs, and Smith singled up the middle to make it 6-1. Astros starter Lucas Harrell was pulled after walking Donaldson to load the bases again. Edgar Gonzalez ended the inning by getting Moss to pop up to short.	Dominguez cut Oakland's lead to 6-2 with a solo home run to left to lead off the third.	Oakland answered by scoring four times in the fourth. Jaso had an RBI double and Cespedes followed with a run-scoring single. Donaldson and Moss hit back-to-back home runs with two outs in the inning to make it 10-2.	Castro added his second homer of the game -- another solo shot to right -- to lead off the bottom of the fourth to cut Oakland's lead to 10-3. Castro plated Jose Altuve with an RBI single in the sixth to get Houston within 10-4.	Dominguez hit his second home run with one out in the seventh -- a solo shot off the facade in left -- to trim the lead to 10-5 off Kideki Okajima.	Donaldson put the A's back up by six with an RBI double in the eighth, scoring Smith.	Harrell (3-6), who has lost four straight, allowed six runs on six hits with three walks and one strikeout in a season-low 1 2/3 innings. Harrell has allowed five or more runs in three of his last five starts, and in two starts against Oakland this season, the right-hander has allowed 14 runs in six innings.	Houston manager Bo Porter said Harrell did not have his good stuff, and Oakland put good swings on him when he put the ball in the strike zone.	"I think it starts with command," Porter said. "When you're a sinker ball pitcher, you're one pitch away from a double-play and getting out of it. You have to lock into it, get the ground ball, and minimize the damage."	Harrell said his command was not off.	"There's pretty much only two things to say about the game," Harrell said. "It's embarrassing and it's frustrating. That's pretty much all I have to say."	Game notes	 Oakland SS Jed Lowrie, who was out of the lineup for the third straight game, took ground balls and hit batting practice before Saturday's game. Lowrie has been out since being hit by a pitch on his right foot Tuesday. . Oakland OF Chris Young's three-run home run Friday night snapped an Oakland-record streak of 15 consecutive solo home runs by the A's. .

LOS ANGELES --  For a team that hasn't played well from behind, the Los Angeles Dodgers managed to pull out a victory after trailing and then blowing a two-run lead against a club with the best record in baseball.	Adrian Gonzalez homered and drove in three runs, Mark Ellis lined a go-ahead double in the sixth inning and the Dodgers defeated St. Louis 5-3 on Saturday night to snap the Cardinals' three-game winning streak.	"Just the fact that we stayed in the game helps," Gonzalez said. "It's not that we're not fighting. We're just going down in order and not getting guys on base."	The last-place Dodgers, who had lost five of seven, gave up a two-run lead before Ellis' two-out hit off Seth Maness (3-1) scored Carl Crawford from first base to make it 4-3.	Dodgers manager Don Mattingly pulled out all the stops in trying to orchestrate a victory. He made double switches in the sixth and seventh, and then inserted pinch-hitter Juan Uribe in the eighth, resulting in an RBI double.	Paco Rodriguez (1-2) earned his first major league victory with a scoreless inning of relief on 10 pitches. He came in with the bases loaded in the sixth and escaped the jam while preserving a 3-3 tie. Brandon League tossed a scoreless ninth to earn his 10th save in 12 chances.	The NL Central-leading Cardinals tied the game at 3 on David Freese's broken-bat RBI double and Pete Kozma's infield single in the sixth. Nick Punto made a diving stop behind third base, but he couldn't throw out Kozma.	"I thought I did (have a double down the line), but he made an outstanding play," Kozma said. "If it gets through, two and maybe three runs score."	The Dodgers took a 2-1 lead on Gonzalez's RBI double off Joe Kelly in the third. Gonzalez led off the fifth with his fifth homer, extending the lead to 3-1. He tied the score at 1 in the first with an RBI double.	Ellis (.309), Gonzalez (.316) and Punto (.340), who went 3 for 4, powered the Dodgers' offense from the top of the order while sluggers Matt Kemp and Andre Ethier combined to go hitless in seven at-bats. Kemp struck out twice, including once with runners on first and second to end the sixth. The duo was a combined 0 for 6 on Friday.	Fans booed both Kemp and Ethier.	"It may be a little part of the fans' frustration when you have high expectations," Mattingly said. "You change that by playing better and winning games."	Mattingly made his second double switch in the seventh, with Kenley Jansen taking the mound and Skip Schumaker replacing Kemp in center field. A clearly frustrated Kemp returned to the dugout shouting, but Mattingly said he didn't take him out because he's struggling.	"It's tough because you don't want to take to switch one of your guys out but it was the only move I felt I had," he said.	The win helped Kemp cool down.	"It had been a bad day for me. I didn't do much to help the team," he said. "That's how they feel. Let them do what they want to do."	Gonzalez didn't like the negative reaction to Kemp.	"Kemp is never a guy who should be booed," he said. "He's trying his heart out. He cares more than anybody out here. He wants to do more. He'll get out of it."	Los Angeles starter Ted Lilly allowed two runs and two hits in 5 1/3 innings in his first major league game since a 12-2 loss to Colorado on April 29. The left-hander struck out three and walked one in his third start of the year. He retired 14 in a row during one stretch.	Lilly began the season late on April 24 after recovering from offseason shoulder surgery, then went on the disabled list from April 30 to May 20 with a strained right rib cage.	"I was hoping to go a little deeper. Fortunately, we won the game," he said. "My timing was a little in and out. My command wasn't as good as I would like it. I still have a little ways to go as far as sharpness. That being said, it's the best I've thrown the ball in a while."	Cardinals starter John Gast left in the bottom of the second because of left shoulder tightness. He faced six batters, giving up one run and one hit. The rookie left-hander threw 25 pitches, walking two and striking out none.	"I wasn't getting real loose in the bullpen and then it got worse once I got out there," he said. "It was kind of tight and weak, and it was affecting my command and velocity the whole time. Last year I sat out a start because of something in the front of my shoulder, and today it was in the back of it."	St. Louis already has three starters on the disabled list: Chris Carpenter (who hasn't pitched this season), Jaime Garcia and Jake Westbrook. Gast was starting in place of Westbrook.	Game notes	 Kelly tied his career high with six strikeouts and equaled his longest relief appearance of the season, allowing two runs in three innings. ... Dodgers SS Dee Gordon snapped an 0-for-25 slump when he singled in the fourth, his first hit since May 13 against Washington. ... The Dodgers improved to 1,009-1,007-16 in the teams' all-time series. ... The Cardinals are undefeated in their last seven series (6-0-1) going into Sunday's finale.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

WASHINGTON -- In the Philadelphia Phillies' simultaneous pursuit of both the Washington Nationals and a .500 record, Ryne Sandberg and Michael Young put together an all-out pursuit of home plate.	Young scored the go-ahead run from first base on a two-out single in the eighth inning Saturday night, never hesitating as the ball headed to the right-field corner. Waved home by third-base coach Sandberg -- who made a cautious decision to hold up a runner in a vital situation in a loss the night before -- Young stretched his hand across the plate to beat Bryce Harper's throw in a 5-3 win over the Nationals.	"You guys were asking before the game about Sandberg being more aggressive," manager Charlie Manuel said. "I think he was pretty aggressive there. That's a gutsy, aggressive move."	The win evened the three-game series and gives the Phillies (24-25) another chance to level their record in Sunday's finale -- when they can also catch the Nationals for second place in the NL East. Philadelphia hasn't been at .500 since 6-6 in mid-April.	"It's a big series, considering the time of year, for sure," Young said. "I don't think anyone's under any illusions that this is going to decide who wins the division, but we're playing a very good club in their ballpark. It's a big May series."	The score was tied at 3 when Young walked and came home on Delmon Young's single. Pinch-runner Michael Martinez then scored on a double by Domonic Brown, who earlier hit his ninth home run.	The eighth-inning spurt came off Drew Storen (0-1), the latest failure for a Nationals bullpen that manager Davey Johnson said "keeps me up more than the offense" -- a strong statement considering that Johnson has vowed to stop shaving until his lineup breaks out of its collective hitting slump.	Storen's ERA rose to 5.21.	"He's not where we want him to be. He's not locating like he usually can," Johnson said. "He made some good pitches but, you know, I've got to have him. He's important to our bullpen."	Chad Durbin (1-0) got two outs for the win, retiring two of the four batters he faced while lowering his ERA to 7.71. The Phillies' four relievers didn't allow a run, but Durbin had to bail out Antonio Bastardo in the seventh, and Jeremy Horst finished up after Durbin allowed two baserunners in the eighth.	"We wobbled a little bit, but we regained composure," Manuel said. "It was interesting, but we ended doing a good job, getting guys out when we're supposed to. That's what counts."	Jonathan Papelbon worked the ninth for his ninth save.	Starters Dan Haren and Jonathan Pettibone both went six innings. Haren had quite the eclectic line: six innings, three runs, 10 strikeouts, one walk and four hits -- all for extra bases. Brown and Erik Kratz hit homers on back-to-back pitches in the second inning, and Pettibone and Jimmy Rollins pounded back-to-back doubles to produce a run in the fifth.	Pettibone, a rookie yet to lose a decision over seven starts, matched his career high with six strikeouts while scattering nine hits and three runs. He allowed single runs in the third, fourth and fifth.	Denard Span had three hits, including an RBI single, while Adam LaRoche had an RBI single and an opposite-field homer for the Nationals, but it was hardly the offensive outburst Johnson has been seeking during his razor boycott. The 70-year-old manager decided to keep letting his facial hair grow despite a modest five-run output in Friday night's win.	"My wife said I could keep it one more day," Johnson said before the game. "The players want me to keep it. They think it looks better."	Asked if he thinks it looks better, Johnson said: "With the fuzz I've got? It's gray. You kidding me? You can't hardly see it, if you've got my eyes. I can't see it unless I put my glasses on."	Game notes	The play of the day was made accidentally by Nationals 2B Steve Lombardozzi. While trying to field a drag bunt by Freddy Galvis, Lombardozzi had the ball carom off his glove and his knee -- and straight to 1B LaRoche for the out. ... Nationals OF Tyler Moore singled for the second straight game, raising his average to a still-dubious .139. His struggles earned a special mention when Johnson was talking about facial hair. "I told Tyler the reason I was growing this was for him, to change his luck," the manager said. ... Pettibone's double sailed over the head of Span in center, the pitcher's second major league hit and first for extra bases. ... Pettibone became the first Phillies rookie to allow three earned runs or fewer in each of his first seven starts since Charles Hudson in 1983. ... The Nationals called up utility man Jeff Kobernus from Triple-A Syracuse and designated RHP Yunesky Maya for assignment. Kobernus made his major league debut as a pinch runner in the eighth.
