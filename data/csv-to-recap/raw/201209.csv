PHILADELPHIA --  Kyle Kendrick has helped turn the surging Phillies from September spoiler into a potential playoff contender.	Kendrick struck out a career-high eight over seven strong innings to lead Philadelphia to its fifth straight win, 3-1 over the Miami Marlins on Monday night.	Staked to a 3-0 lead, Kendrick (9-10) took a no-hitter into the sixth before Rob Brantly's leadoff single. The right-hander escaped a bases-loaded jam when he struck out Giancarlo Stanton on a changeup.	Often overlooked on a staff that includes Cole Hamels, Roy Halladay and Cliff Lee, Kendrick has been a huge reason why the Phillies (70-71) are making a late push to get into the NL wild-card race. He's won five of his last six starts and has allowed two earned runs or less in each of his past six.	"We definitely know where we're at," Kendrick said. "We've got to win every night. But we're in the hunt. That's fun. Hopefully we can make something happen."	The Phillies have won 13 of 17 overall. They began the night six games behind St. Louis for the second NL wild-card spot and are trying to leapfrog a mix of teams that includes Milwaukee, Pittsburgh and Los Angeles.	Manager Charlie Manuel predicted the Phillies would have to win 14 or 15 games over the final 21 to make the playoffs.	"We might win all 21 of them," he said, smiling.	Forget ruining other teams' chances at a postseason berth. The Phillies, who have won the last five NL East titles, plan to take one for themselves.	Domonic Brown hit a two-run homer off Wade LeBlanc (2-4), and a hustling Michael Martinez scored on a wild pitch in a three-run fifth.	Antonio Bastardo tossed a scoreless ninth for his first save this season. He got the call after Jonathan Papelbon earned a win and save in a doubleheader sweep against Colorado on Sunday.	"I don't think anybody's looking at the standings," Brown said.	Kendrick struck out five of the first seven batters he faced and had more than 40,000 fans buzzing early.	There was even the standard defensive gem that accompanies no-hitters.	Carlos Lee hit a chopper that eked over a leaping Kendrick's outstretched glove. Second baseman Chase Utley charged and made the throw to nip Lee.	Kendrick got a standing ovation in the sixth after Brantly's single. He walked two batters to load the bases before fanning Stanton to keep the shutout intact and send the crowd into a frenzy.	"I see more life, more get-up and go," Manuel said.	Donovan Solano made it 3-1 on a sacrifice fly in the seventh. Kendrick allowed two hits and walked three.	The Phillies were 57-67 on Aug. 22 but can hit the .500 mark with a win Tuesday for the first time since they were 28-28 on June 4. They could do some damage over the next 10 games, too. Monday kicked off a stretch of 10 straight against losing teams in the Marlins, Astros and Mets.	Philadelphia has some punch off the bench for the playoff push.	Darin Ruf was called up Monday after he led all minor leaguers with 38 home runs for Double-A Reading. He hit 20 homers in August and earned the nickname "Babe." Manuel said he was eager to see the rookie take some cuts.	Brown showed Ruf how to go deep in the majors in the fifth. After Ty Wigginton walked leading off the inning, Brown's second homer of the season landed just inside the right-field foul pole. Martinez doubled two batters later, advanced to third on a grounder and hustled home on a wild pitch.	"The first mistake was in not being aggressive," LeBlanc said. "I left the pitch belt high in the middle of the plate."	LeBlanc gave up four hits and struck out five in five innings.	"We had opportunities with the right people at the plate, but we didn't swing the ball well," Marlins manager Ozzie Guillen said.	Game notes	 Stanton had homered in six straight road games. ... Miami CF Justin Ruggiano struck out four times. ... Phillies RHP Tyler Cloyd will start Thursday on short rest against Houston. ... The Phillies send Roy Halladay (9-7, 3.87 ERA) to the mound Tuesday against Miami rookie Nathan Eovaldi (4-11, 4.44).	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

CINCINNATI --  Ryan Ludwick's simple grounder ended the Reds' longest game of the season. No such reprieve for the Pittsburgh Pirates, whose misery goes on.	Ludwick drove in the winning run with a two-out infield single in the 14th inning, lifting the Cincinnati Reds to a marathon 4-3 victory Monday night that handed the fading Pirates their fourth straight loss.	Rick VandenHurk (0-1), called up before the game, started the 14th and gave up a single by Devin Mesoraco. Brandon Phillips reached when the Pirates failed to get a forceout on his grounder, and the runners advanced on a wild pitch.	Pirates shortstop Chase d'Arnaud couldn't come up with Ludwick's grounder in the hole, finally ending it.	"I stunk the entire game," said Ludwick, who was 0-for-5 before the final at-bat. "I must've had a thousand chances to win the game, and I finally did it on the thousandth chance. Every time I came up, it seemed like there were guys on base. I'm glad I finally got it done in ... what inning was it? The 14th?"	Yes, the 14th. And there was plenty of drama in both halves of it.	The Pirates loaded the bases with none out in the top of the 14th against Alfredo Simon (2-2) and failed to score -- Jose Tabata grounded out to end the threat. The organist played "Take Me Out To The Ball Game" again between innings.	It was the Reds' longest game of the season in innings and time -- 5 hours, 22 minutes. The Pirates played a 19-inning, 6-hour game against St. Louis last month.	"That was a game we needed big time," Cincinnati manager Dusty Baker said. "We were spent, emotionally and physically."	Imagine what the Pirates felt!	Their slump -- four straight losses and 21 in the past 30 games -- has dropped them a season-high 12 games behind the first-place Reds in the NL Central.	"Well, you know, I've heard that whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger," manager Clint Hurdle said. "We're fighting through this thing. This has been a big push for us. It's been a hard time for a while."	Sam LeCure bailed out Reds closer Aroldis Chapman to keep it tied in the 10th, retiring Michael McKenry on a grounder with the bases loaded. LeCure struck out the side in the 11th.	Chapman had trouble getting his fastball up to speed in his first appearance since Friday, when he had his club-record streak of 27 straight saves snapped. Chapman walked the bases loaded around a pair of outs, his fastball topping out at 96 mph.	Baker said after the game that Chapman will get some rest.	"His velocity's down," Baker said. "There's no pain, but he might be a little tired. We might have to rest him for a few days. He was analyzed by the doctor and his shoulder might be a little fatigued."	The Reds wasted a chance in the bottom of the 10th, leaving the bases loaded when Jay Bruce struck out. Bruce went 0-for-5, ending his nine-game hitting streak.	Plate umpire Phil Cuzzi warned both benches after Jared Hughes hit Brandon Phillips in the leg with a one-out pitch in the eighth. Phillips paused a moment, picked up the ball and tossed it back toward the mound before heading to first base. The Pirates were upset earlier in the season when a couple of their players got plunked in games.	The game drew 16,577 fans, the smallest crowd at Great American Ball Park this season. The second-smallest crowd of the season also was for a Pirates game -- 16,859 for a 5-4 Reds win on June 6.	Pittsburgh left-hander Wandy Rodriguez allowed only one hit through the first six innings -- Chris Heisey's solo homer. Hughes relieved in the seventh and gave up a two-run double by Dioner Navarro that tied it at 3.	Andrew McCutchen homered off Mat Latos, who got a no-decision and remained unbeaten against the Pirates in his career. The right-hander gave up three runs and remained 4-0 in six career starts against Pittsburgh, allowing a total of nine runs.	Game notes	 There were more than 500 dogs in the stands as part of a promotion that allowed fans to bring their pets. ... VandenHurk and d'Arnaud were called up before the game, along with RHP Bryan Morris. ... The Reds went 32-16 without 1B Joey Votto and are 2/3 since his return. Votto celebrated his 29th birthday. ... Reds SS Zack Cozart missed his sixth straight game with a strained oblique muscle. ... Reds 3B Scott Rolen took grounders at third base before the game to test his back, which sidelined him for four games, and pinch-hit in the 13th. He grounded out.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

NEW YORK --  Gio Gonzalez was totally prepared to take on the New York Mets. A question about a possible Cy Young Award? That threw him.	Gonzalez earned his big league-leading 19th victory and the Washington Nationals backed him with three home runs to beat the listless Mets 5-1 Monday night.	Gonzalez is certainly a prime contender for the top pitching prize. But he playfully put up his hands when the subject was broached after the game.	"When you start looking at one thing, it'll drive you crazy," he said. "If it comes, it comes."	Mets knuckleballer R.A. Dickey has 18 wins and a better ERA than Gonzalez, and starts against the Nationals on Tuesday night. Asked whether he was eager for Washington to face Dickey -- and perhaps dent his Cy Young chances -- manager Davey Johnson had a simple answer.	"Not really," he said.	Kurt Suzuki put the Nationals ahead with a home run right after catcher Kelly Shoppach dropped his wind-blown foul popup for an error. Ryan Zimmerman launched a two-run shot later in the third inning and Ian Desmond added a two-run drive in the fourth.	That was plenty for Gonzalez (19-7) and the team with the best record in the majors. The lefty gave up three hits over six innings, none until Scott Hairston homered in the fourth.	Gonzalez worked around five walks and extended his career high for wins. He seemed relaxed enough, chatting with fans in the front row while waiting in the on-deck circle in the sixth as Suzuki batted.	Gonzalez matched a season high for walks, yet lowered his ERA to 2.93.	"Couldn't find the strike zone," he said. "Drank a little too much coffee. I don't know what it was."	The Nationals opened a six-game swing that ends this weekend in Atlanta, where they'll play their closest pursuers in the NL East.	It had already been a jocular trip for the Nationals by the time they arrived in New York. As part of rookie hazing that is traditional in baseball culture, the club made its newcomers dress up as the U.S. Olympic women's gymnastics team -- including red leotards and gold medals -- for the train ride from Washington to Manhattan and dinner out Sunday night.	Teen star Bryce Harper wore the outfit, then had a wardrobe malfunction against the Mets. He broke his belt while diving for Andres Torres' liner in the fourth, and quickly hustled to the Nationals' bullpen in center field for a loaner.	The Mets lost their fourth in a row, deepening their drought at Citi Field. They tied a team record by scoring three or fewer runs for the 11th straight game at home, matching the mark last done in 1979.	"I've done this long enough to know that you don't ever give up," manager Terry Collins said. "You don't ever stop, you don't ever stop grinding it out. You don't ever stop walking through the locker room every day making sure the guys are upbeat, that they're positive, trying to move forward. That doesn't change one bit."	David Wright and his teammates have gone 106 straight innings at home without scoring more than one run.	Collins tried a timing adjustment, changing when his starters took batting practice. He had them hit later, wanting to cut down the 2 1/2-hour gap between BP and game time.	"We're kind of grasping at straws," Collins admitted.	While Andy Murray was winning the U.S. Open tennis tournament right across the street, Mets rookie Collin McHugh (0-2) was serving up home runs. Suzuki hit his fourth, Zimmerman got his 21st and Desmond connected for his 22nd, all off the 25-year-old righty making his third major league start.	Zimmerman's shot was retrieved by a fan dressed in Mets orange who hopped onto the black batter's eye in dead center field and danced with the souvenir, drawing cheers from the crowd.	Game notes	 Dickey (18-4, 2.64 ERA) will oppose RHP Jordan Zimmermann (10-8, 2.99). ... Harper said he doesn't expect to start against Dickey -- the rookie is 0 for 10 with six strikeouts vs. the knuckleballer, no matter where he stands or what he swings. "In, out, up, down, back and forth, light, heavy, tried it all. Just can't hit the guy," Harper said. ... Gonzalez has beaten the Mets three times in the last two months. ... Zimmerman has a 14-game hitting streak. ... Washington is 12-4 against the Mets this year. ... Torres took away an extra-base hit from Danny Espinosa with a leaping grab.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

HOUSTON --  With 21 games left in this dreadful season, the Chicago Cubs are eyeing a magic number.	No, not the number playoff contending teams are looking at to seal their trip to the postseason. With 86 losses, this club is determined to avoid becoming the first Cubs team to lose 100 games since 1966.	On Monday night they moved a bit closer to that goal with a 4-1 win over the Houston Astros -- owners of the only record in baseball worse than theirs.	Dave Sappelt scored the go-ahead run on a wild pitch and had three RBIs to lead the team to the victory.	"Oh yeah, we count down every day -- our magic number to not get 100," Sappelt said. "So we definitely have that in the back of our minds."	Sappelt, who was recalled from Triple-A Iowa on Sept. 1, drove in his first run for the Cubs with a double to the left-field corner to put Chicago up 1-0 in the second inning.	The game was tied 1-all in the sixth before Sappelt scored on a wild pitch by Fernando Rodriguez (1-10) that bounced in the dirt and rolled between catcher Jason Castro's legs.	Sappelt came through again in the seventh, knocking a double off the wall in center field just short of the home run line to score a pair of insurance runs.	The Cubs won their fourth straight, matching their season high.	"Those guys are starting to understand how close that 100 losses is," Cubs manager Dale Sveum said. "That's the goal. That's the talk now and obviously they're responding now."	Justin Maxwell tripled on a ball that rolled up onto Tal's Hill in center field to start Houston's fourth. Castro tied it at 1 with a single to right field on a night when the Astros played with Minute Maid Park's retractable roof open for the first time since May 9.	Chicago starter Chris Volstad (3-10) allowed four hits and a run in five innings for his first win on the road in eight starts this season. Carlos Marmol gave up one hit in a scoreless ninth for his 19th save.	Volstad is 3-3 since being recalled from Iowa on Aug. 1.	"I feel like since I've come back, I've been a different pitcher, starting with that L.A. game," he said. "I feel good. I've just got to continue it and keep it going -- that whole consistency thing."	This was an ugly game that included 14 walks, two hit batters, three wild pitches and 24 left on base. By the time the 3-hour, 50-minute game ended, there were only a few hundred fans left and most of them were chanting, "Let's go, Cubbies!"	"It seemed like there was a 2-hour rain delay. It was kind of funny how long it took," Sveum said.	The Cubs missed several chances to score before finally taking the lead. Welington Castillo got things going in the fourth inning with a single to center field. Volstad singled with two outs before Joe Mather singled to left. Castillo raced toward home on the play, but left fielder J.D. Martinez's throw beat him to the plate to end the inning.	Houston starter Dallas Keuchel was lifted for Chuckie Fick in the fifth inning and he allowed a single by Darwin Barney before plunking Anthony Rizzo. His defense helped him out when the Astros turned a double play on a ball hit by Alfonso Soriano that left Barney at third. Fick intentionally walked Starlin Castro, but escaped the jam by striking out Castillo.	The Astros also missed opportunities in this one. Jimmy Paredes hit a stand-up triple to the corner of right field to start the fifth inning before two walks left the bases loaded with two outs. The Astros came away empty when Matt Dominguez grounded out.	"We had opportunities in the first and the fifth," Maxwell said. "We had (Volstad) on the ropes all night, but we weren't able to push many across."	Houston interim manager Tony DeFrancesco was disappointed that his team didn't capitalize on its chances.	"I'm glad the guys are getting opportunities to prove they are major league hitters, but at some point, the guys have to be accountable for their at-bats and try to grind them out," he said.	Keuchel yielded six hits and a run with two walks in four innings in his first start since returning from Triple-A Oklahoma City.	Game notes	 The Astros released RHP Francisco Cordero and purchased the contract of RHP Enerio Del Rosario before Monday's game. ... These teams continue the series on Tuesday when Houston's Jordan Lyles opposes Justin Germano.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO --  The White Sox have been getting runners on. The trouble's been getting them in during a stretch in which they're trying to hold on to the top spot in the AL Central.	Alex Rios provided a solution with one swing Monday night, a three-run homer that  propelled the White Sox to a 6-1 victory over the Detroit Tigers and increased Chicago's division lead to three games.	Rios's drive put the White Sox ahead, A.J. Pierzynski followed with a solo shot and Jose Quintana survived a shaky start to pitch one-run ball into the eighth.	"I think when Rios hits that ball, it just kinds of pops the cork on all the angst of not getting guys in," Chicago manager Robin Ventura said. "That was a pretty big home run for us."	The White Sox had lost seven straight to Detroit, managed just two hits against Rick Porcello (9-12) and were 0 for 10 with runners in scoring position when an error on Detroit second baseman Omar Infante gave them an opening.	Infante muffed Dewayne Wise's easy, one-out grounder in the sixth. Paul Konerko singled to left to put runners at the corners and Rios lined a pitch over the wall in left center, his 23rd homer of the season. Pierzynski followed with his 26th to center field for a 4-1 lead, ending Porcello's night and sending him to his sixth straight loss. Gordon Beckham added a two-run shot in the eighth off Octavio Dotel.	"We struggled the last games against them and this win being the first one of the series is pretty big," Rios said. "This whole series is pretty important for both of the teams. We are going to have a chance to maybe get a couple of games ahead if we win the series. It could decide what is going to happen at the end of the year."	Quintana (6-4), who was 1-3 in his previous 10 starts, retired 10 straight before walking Ryan Raburn with two outs in the eight and being replaced by Brian Omogrosso. Miguel Cabrera doubled before Donnie Veal got Prince Fielder to ground out to second.	Quintana had failed to make it out of the fourth inning in his two previous outings but settled down after a shaky start Monday night and allowed one run on seven hits -- none after Gerald Laird's fifth inning double -- in 7 2/3 innings.	He walked two and struck out seven and got Cabrera to ground into a double play with two on and no outs in the third and the Tigers leading 1-0.	"As soon as he got that double play, he settled down. It was the biggest play of the game," Pierzynski said.	"He (Cabera) is probably the best hitter in baseball right now. You could see Q's confidence grow and you kind of see the team's confidence grow. ...This is probably the biggest game he ever pitched in his life."	Porcello, 3-0 this season against the White Sox entering the game, gave up five hits and four runs -- three earned -- in 5 1/3 innings. Detroit made three errors in the game, and the Tigers have now lost four straight.	"When you get in a tough situation like that, you've got to bear down and find something within to get out of those jams. I wasn't able to do that," Porcello said	"They caught me that one inning," he said. "They tagged it in the sixth."	Delmon Young, who led Detroit's three-game sweep of the White Sox at Comerica Park a little more than a week ago, continued his tear with a one-out single in the second, moved up on Quintana's wild pitch and scored on Jhonny Peralta's RBI single. Peralta was thrown out trying to stretch or it could have an even bigger inning since Avisail Garcia and Infante followed with infield singles before Quintana got the third out.	Detroit has managed just six runs total in its four-game losing streak.	"It's pretty simple. We just didn't play a real good game defensively and of course we only got the one run again. That pretty much sums it up," Tigers manager Jim Leyland said.	"Omar missed a groundball, but that's just part of the game. ... Unfortunately we put Rick in a tough bind. When you're scoring one, two runs a game, you can hardly blame your defense for what's going on. Right now we're just not scoring runs."	Game notes	 White Sox DH Adam Dunn missed his fourth straight game with a strained right oblique. 3B Kevin Youkilis returned to the team after missing three games to be with his wife as she gave birth to their child. And Ventura said it's likely Gavin Floyd will return to the rotation for Wednesday's Game 3. He's been on the DL since Aug. 28 with a right elbow strain. ... Young entered the game with a .359 average in 36 games at U.S. Cellular Field with seven homers and 25 RBIs. ... Detroit still leads the season series 10-5. ...  It's Detroit's Doug Fister (8-8) against Chicago's Jake Peavy (10-10) in Tuesday night's Game 2 of the pivotal four-game series.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

MILWAUKEE --  Norichika Aoki has been coming up with some big hits for the Brewers during a surge that has taken them to the fringe of the NL wild-card race.	Aoki had a two-run double to key a four-run seventh inning and made a key defensive throw, helping the Milwaukee Brewers rally past the Atlanta Braves 4-1 Monday night.	The Brewers sent 10 batters to the plate in the seventh, but did all the damage on two hits and a sacrifice fly in snapping the Braves' five-game winning streak.	"The few hits we got, Nori's was huge," Brewers manager Ron Roenicke said after Milwaukee improved to 15-2 over their last 17 home games, including a seven-game winning streak at Miller Park. "He's really been driving the ball. He's hitting both gaps. It's a nice swing. It's not feeling for the ball. He's swinging it."	On Sunday, Aoki's two-run homer in the ninth against St. Louis tied the game at 4, but the Brewers lost to the Cardinals 5-4 on Allen Craig's two-out RBI single.	Aoki, speaking through his interpreter Kosuke Inaji, said that he really wasn't shocked by the new power stroke.	"I really wouldn't say surprised," Aoki said. "I'm happy with the results of the extra-base hits I've been getting lately."	Milwaukee has won 16 of 21. The Brewers entered Monday six games behind St. Louis for the final NL wild-card spot. The Braves were 5½ games ahead of the Cardinals for home-field advantage in the one-game wild-card playoff.	Martin Maldonado led off the seventh with a single off Jonny Venters (5-4), who was trying to protect a 1-0 lead for Braves starter Mike Minor. Pinch-hitter Jean Segura then walked.	Milwaukee got a break when Jeff Bianchi bunted back to Venters, who fielded the sacrifice and threw wide of third baseman Chipper Jones. Pinch-runner Eric Farris scored on the throwing error and Segura and Bianchi each moved up a base.	"Mike threw the ball so well and my job is to come in and hold them down," Venters said. "I didn't do my job. I gave it up."	Venters said it was bad fundamentals.	"I felt like I got there quick, but I rushed it and made a bad throw," he said.	Chad Durbin came on to face pinch-hitter Jonathan Lucroy and walked him to load the bases. Aoki then hit a 2-0 pitch to the wall in left for a two-run double. Lucroy scored on Carlos Gomez's sacrifice fly to complete the scoring.	Jose Veras (4-4) worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the seventh to earn the victory.	John Axford worked the ninth for his 28th save.	The Braves had four runners thrown out on the base paths, committed two errors and issued seven walks. They also left seven men on base over the final six innings.	"A lot of good things happening without getting a lot of hits," Roenicke said. "Great pitching. Nori, the throw to third. Gomey, the throw to third, Maldonado, the two throws, one on the steal, one on the pickoff. Some big plays defensively."	Minor pitched 5 2/3 innings of two-hit ball for Atlanta and looked to be in line for his second victory over Milwaukee this season.	He struck out eight, walked two and gave up a ground-rule double to Aoki in the third and a single to Maldonado in the fourth. After striking out Ryan Braun with his 115th pitch for the second out in the sixth, Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez brought in Cory Gearrin. After Aramis Ramirez walked, Gearrin struck out Rickie Weeks swinging.	Minor beat the Brewers 2-1 at Turner Field on April 14 when he allowed two hits and one unearned run in 7 1/3 innings.	"It seems like there's always one guy on a staff who doesn't get run support," Gonzalez said. "And, that's Mike. He really battled, but had to throw 115 pitches."	Wily Peralta, a September call-up, was looking for his second consecutive victory after beating Miami Wednesday in his first start.	He allowed one run on seven hits in six innings with four strikeouts and a walk.	The Braves scored in the fifth when Dan Uggla singled to start the inning. Running on the pitch, he took third when Brian McCann's single slipped through the spot vacated by Bianchi as the Brewers shortstop broke to cover second. Uggla scored when Andrelton Simmons, who started his first game since he broke his pinky finger on July 8, hit into a double play.	Braun, who left Sunday's game against the St. Louis Cardinals in the sixth inning with a sore right wrist, was back in the lineup. He went 0 for 2 with a walk.	Jones received a rousing ovation when he came to bat in the first. Before he stepped into the batter's box, he looked toward the stands down each foul line and acknowledged the crowd's cheers by waving his batting helmet. His single in the fifth was his 2,715 career hit and tied him with Bill Buckner for 60th all-time.	Game notes	 Milwaukee 1B Corey Hart left Sunday's game against the St. Louis Cardinals in the fifth inning with a left ankle sprain. He is day to day. Roenicke said the injury was more the plantar fascia. ... Braves RHP Ben Sheets, who is on the 15-day disabled list with right shoulder inflammation, threw approximately 20 pitches in two innings of simulated action. "I hope I get back on the mound," the right-hander said. "Really, tomorrow we'll see how I feel and go from there. I felt good today." Gonzalez said that Sheets, who is 4-4 with a 3.54 ERA in eight starts, could pitch out of the bullpen or even make an emergency start once he's cleared for action. ... The Brewers plan to honor Jones before Wednesday's afternoon game.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

MINNEAPOLIS --  This season has long been lost for the Minnesota Twins. The problems created by an overmatched starting rotation and underwhelming performances in the middle infield proved to be too much to overcome.	A second straight miserable season has opened the door for a bevy of new faces going forward, and Samuel Deduno and Pedro Florimon are pushing hard to be a part of the solution going into next season.	Deduno struck out six in seven innings and Florimon made two stellar defensive plays to go with a double and a triple, lifting the Twins to a 7-2 win over the Cleveland Indians on Monday night.	"He knows he's making a good impression on the coaches and the team, and just keep playing the way he's playing, and he feels a lot of confidence he's going to be back next year," second baseman Alexi Casilla said while serving as the 25-year-old Florimon's interpreter.	Deduno (6-3) gave up just three hits and walked three, Ryan Doumit homered and Justin Morneau drove in two runs for the Twins, who took the final three games of the four-game series.	"Everything was working tonight," Deduno said. "Changeup, curveball, slider. Everything was working."	Lonnie Chisenhall homered in his first game since June 29 for the stumbling Indians, who are an AL-worst 15-41 since the All-Star break to fall into a tie with the Twins for last place in the Central division. Justin Masterson (11-13) gave up six runs and seven hits in 6 2/3 innings.	It was a dangerous game for baserunners. Deduno hit Shin-Soo Choo in the helmet with an errant pickoff attempt in the third, a play reminiscent of the one from Boston reliever Franklin Morales in June that knocked Seattle's Franklin Gutierrez out for almost two months. Choo remained in the game.	After his RBI double in the seventh, Florimon was hit in the back of the head on a throw from Masterson while diving back to second base. There was an audible thud from the impact, and the shortstop remained down for a minute while trainers rushed to him. He, too, remained in the game and eventually scored from third on a wild pitch.	"He said it just hurt in the moment but nothing major to come out of the game," Casilla said.	Being a little wild is nothing new for Deduno, who walked 36 batters in his first eight starts. But the Dominican right-hander has been able to harness his control a little better of late, allowing just 11 hits and walking six in his past three starts. He took a no-hitter into the sixth inning against the Tribe and has now allowed three hits or fewer over seven-plus innings in three of his 12 starts.	"I was going, 'Oh, no. He's going to throw a 150-pitch no-hitter and I'm going to leave him out there,'" manager Ron Gardenhire said.	Deduno was the beneficiary of several solid defensive plays, including a diving catch from Ben Revere in center field in the second inning, Joe Mauer leaning over the Indians' dugout railing to snag a foul ball in the fourth and Florimon barehanding a soft grounder to get Casey Kotchman in the seventh.	That play may have been the biggest, because Chisenhall, who broke his right arm after being hit by a pitch from Baltimore's Jake Arrieta, hit a solo homer to right field on the next pitch, making it 3-2.	Minnesota scored three more in the seventh and Doumit hit a drive to center in the eighth to put the game away.	"We couldn't do anything against Deduno," Indians manager Manny Acta said. "He had a good slider and he threw it at any time in the count, and we couldn't do much against him."	Mauer had two hits and an RBI to raise his average to .319 and Casilla added two more highlight-reel plays at second for the Twins.	The Indians played without All-Star shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera, who was given the day off after leaving the game on Sunday with a sore right wrist. The injury first flared up last week during batting practice. Cabrera had X-rays that showed no broken bones and is day-to-day.	The Indians (59-82) have lost 11 of their past 15 to fall a season-worst 23 games under .500.	Game notes	 Acta on Cabrera: "We're not going to put him out there until he's ready to play pain-free." ... Twins OF Chris Parmelee was scratched a few hours before the game with a strained right groin. He is day-to-day. ... The announced attendance of 27,526 was the lowest in Target Field's two-plus seasons. ... Doumit's 16 HRs this season are a new career high.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

DENVER --  San Francisco Giants pitcher Ryan Vogelsong had a ready response when asked if he saw a way out of his recent struggles.	"Yeah," Vogelsong said. "Stop being bad. I'm costing us games right now and I'm not real happy about it."	Colorado pitcher Alex White homered off Vogelsong, and the Rockies went on to beat him for the first time in a 6-5 victory Monday night that snapped their five-game losing streak.	Buster Posey and Hunter Pence went deep for the Giants, who lost for only the second time in 10 road games. San Francisco's lead in the NL West was trimmed to five games over the idle Los Angeles Dodgers.	Vogelsong (12-8) allowed four runs and six hits over five innings in losing for the first time in seven career starts against the Rockies. He is 2/3 with a 9.57 ERA in six starts overall since Aug. 13, allowing 28 runs and 43 hits in 26 1/3 innings.	"I'm just not making pitches, missing locations," Vogelsong said. "I felt like I actually got a little bit better as the game went on, so that's a good sign. I felt pretty good about the last couple of innings I threw and I can build off that. But a couple of bad starts in a six-game span is not going to get me down. I'm a battler, guys."	San Francisco manager Bruce Bochy said he's sure Vogelsong's pitching fortunes will turn around soon.	"He's one of our guys and he's going to be out there," Bochy said. "We have all the confidence in the world in him. He's done an unbelievable job for us this year. Vogie is going to be just fine."	The right-hander entered 5-0 with a 1.80 ERA in six previous starts against the Rockies, and the Giants had won all six games. But he was in trouble from the outset this time, allowing successive doubles to Tyler Colvin and Josh Rutledge, the first two batters he faced. One out later, Jordan Pacheco hit an RBI single to put the Rockies up 2-0.	The Giants trailed 6-2 before they got a two-run homer from Posey in the seventh inning off reliever Rex Brothers and then pulled within one in the eighth. Brandon Crawford drew a one-out walk from Matt Belisle, pinch-hitter Aubrey Huff singled and Angel Pagan followed with an RBI double, his third hit of the game.	Belisle got out of the jam by retiring Marco Scutaro and Pablo Sandoval.	Guillermo Moscoso (2-1) picked up the victory by working two innings, allowing one run on three hits. Rafael Betancourt pitched a 1-2-3 ninth for his 28th save in 33 chances.	"Sure, this was a tough game to lose, especially the way we battled back, but we've just got to put this one behind us," Bochy said. "You like having a five-game lead because it does give you a margin of error. But you don't want to slide in the back door. We need to win ballgames."	Colorado manager Jim Tracy was ejected in the bottom of the seventh by second base umpire Angel Campos after a heated argument over an inning-ending double play. Campos ruled that Scutaro tagged Rutledge before throwing to first to get Carlos Gonzalez. Tracy, ejected for the third time this season, argued that Scutaro missed the tag.	The Rockies also lost catcher Ramon Hernandez to a left hamstring strain sustained while running out a double in the fourth. He was replaced by pinch-runner Wilin Rosario, who advanced when Chris Nelson reached on first baseman Brandon Belt's fielding error and came home on Charlie Blackmon's double-play grounder.	White hit his first career homer in the second, offsetting a drive he allowed in the top of the inning to Pence for the Giants' first run.	"Got a good pitch," White said. "He left it up in the zone. Put a good swing on it. It's not going to happen often, but I enjoyed it."	A two-out error by Sandoval on Rosario's grounder to third opened the door to a pair of runs by the Rockies in the sixth. Nelson followed with a run-scoring triple and Blackmon added an RBI single to build a four-run lead.	White was lifted after allowing one run and six hits in four innings after throwing 76 pitches, roughly the limit for starting pitchers in the Rockies' unorthodox four-man rotation.	"I had pretty good command," White said. "Obviously, I fell behind a few times. Pitched pretty well with my four-seam. Used my two-seam when I needed to. Had a good changeup. I threw 76 pitches in four innings. But that's what they asked me to do, so I'm going to keep doing it."	Game notes	 LHP Josh Outman was recalled from Double-A Tulsa before the game by the Rockies. ... Six of the 16 homers allowed by Vogelsong have come in his last four starts. ... White's homer was the first by a Rockies pitcher since May 7 when Drew Pomeranz went deep against San Diego's Edinson Volquez.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Although Jarrod Parker is still fairly new to playoff races, the Oakland right-hander is pretty sure it's best to be aggressive in September, whether on the mound or in the standings.	The rookie's take-charge approach got the Athletics off to a great start in another big series against the surging Los Angeles Angels.	Parker pitched seven innings of three-hit ball, Brandon Moss and Cliff Pennington homered, and the A's snapped the Angels' six-game winning streak with a 3-1 victory Monday night.	With his second straight impressive start against Los Angeles after a hard-luck loss last week, Parker (10-8) and his bullpen held the Angels' surging lineup to four hits. Parker beat the Angels for the first time in his career by going right at Albert Pujols, Mike Trout and Mark Trumbo, holding Los Angeles to one run for only the second time in its past 22 games.	"They were aggressive as well, so I tried to get some early contact, early outs," Parker said. "It's fun. These are the kind of starts that we need, and everybody is going to feed off this kind of energy."	Coco Crisp hit a leadoff triple and scored for the A's, who opened a key four-game series against their California rivals with a measure of revenge for the Angels' three-game sweep in Oakland last week. Those are the only losses since Aug. 23 for the A's, who have won 13 of 16.	"It was definitely a big game for us," Pennington said. "They came into our place and did what they needed to do, so we needed to come in here that way. This was a good start. Right now, every game is huge. There's one or two differences in every game."	Ryan Cook worked the eighth, and Grant Balfour finished uneventfully for his 17th save.	Dan Haren (10-11) pitched into the seventh inning, allowing just four hits and striking out four. But Oakland turned those hits into three runs, and Haren took his first loss since Aug. 16.	Torii Hunter drove in Trout with a third-inning double for the Angels (77-64), who had won 11 of 12 and 15 of 18 in their desperate late surge to join the playoff race.	"I'm not surprised anymore at what they're doing," Hunter said of the A's. "I mean, we were surprised when they first started doing it in early August, but I'm not surprised anymore. They're playing the game, and they've got some really good arms over there."	With its first home loss in seven games, Los Angeles blew a chance to pull within a half-game of Baltimore (78-62) for the second AL wild-card spot. Tampa Bay (77-63) is between the Orioles and the Angels.	Oakland (80-60), which is in the first wild-card slot, is 20 games over .500 for the first time since the end of the 2006 season -- also the year of the team's last postseason appearance. The A's pulled within three games of idle Texas (83-57) atop the AL West.	"Nothing really surprises me in baseball anymore after the way last season finished, and with the way the Orioles and A's are playing this year," Haren said. "We're getting to the point where they're not going away, so it's going to be a fight to the finish and the better team is going to win."	Crisp hit Haren's first pitch of the night high off the right-field wall, easily reaching third before scoring on Seth Smith's groundout. Oakland didn't lead at any point in last week's three losses to the Angels, who outscored the A's 21-5 in the East Bay.	Trout and Hunter evened it in the third inning when Trout walked, stole second, advanced on an error and trotted home on Hunter's double down the right-field line.	Hunter was greeted each inning in right field by a long row of fans wearing fluorescent-yellow T-shirts and holding up signs spelling "Keep Torii!" The beloved outfielder can become a free agent this winter.	Haren retired 12 straight A's on just 38 pitches after Crisp's triple, but Moss led off the fifth with his 17th homer. Pennington added his fifth of the season in the sixth inning, also reaching the elevated stands above right field.	Game notes	 Angels manager Mike Scioscia said ace Jered Weaver will start Thursday against the A's after skipping a start to rest the tendinitis in his right shoulder. Weaver, who felt strong after a bullpen session Monday, would be lined up to start the Angels' final game of the season if he returns Thursday. ... Jerome Williams gets a spot start in Weaver's place when the Angels face the A's on Tuesday night. Oakland counters with Dan Straily, who will make his fourth major league start in Brandon McCarthy's slot in the rotation. ... Los Angeles reliever Nick Maronde gave up a single to Moss after relieving Haren in the seventh. Maronde, a third-round pick in 2011, had struck out each of the first four batters he faced in his major league career since getting promoted from Double-A Arkansas on Sept. 1.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN DIEGO --  Things got so easy for the San Diego Padres on Monday night they spent the last few innings trying to make history.	Cameron Maybin hit a two-run homer, Will Venable had three RBIs and the Padres handed the struggling St. Louis Cardinals an 11-3 loss.	The Padres had 17 hits and scored more than one run in five different innings. They scored five runs in their last two at-bats to break open the game and give both Logan Forsythe and Maybin the opportunity to become the first player in franchise history to hit for the cycle.	Forsythe struck out in each of his last two at-bats, including in the eighth inning when he took such mighty cuts he nearly lifted himself off the ground -- and fell a home run short of the cycle.	"I got away from my approach and tried too hard to make something happen," Forsythe said. "I kind of had to try because it hadn't been done before."	San Diego and Miami are the only teams in the majors who have not had a player hit for the cycle. The Padres are also the only team to have not thrown a no-hitter.	The Padres were aware of it on the bench and were pulling for Forsythe and Maybin, who needed a double in his last at-bat in the eighth for the cycle. Maybin walked.	When someone told Forsythe he didn't get cheated on his swings in the eighth, he said, "No, but it cost me. I learned from it. I won't be doing that again. I tried once and that was good enough."	The loss dropped the Cardinals 9½ games behind first-place Cincinnati in the NL Central. The Reds beat Pittsburgh 4-3 in 14 innings. St. Louis, which has lost four of five, had its lead cut to one game over the idle Los Angeles Dodgers for the second NL wild-card berth.	"Ugly," said Cardinals manager Mike Matheny. "We got a lead, quickly lost it, then couldn't get it stopped. We just had a rough time getting people out."	Maybin connected for his seventh homer off Jaime Garcia (4-7) that broke a 2-all tie in the fourth inning. Maybin scored three runs.	Chris Denorfia tied his career high with four hits and also had two RBIs. Forsythe added three hits to tie his career high as San Diego matched its season best for runs.	"I liked the fact we had Garcia on the ropes in the first, even though he wiggled out of it," San Diego manager Bud Black said about the Padres loading the bases but not scoring.	"We kept putting the pressure on him and we had a lot of big, two-out hits," he added.	The loss started a crucial seven-game West Coast trip for the Cardinals, who begin a four-game set on Thursday night against the Dodgers.	Eric Stults (6-2) allowed three runs on five hits with five strikeouts and a walk in 5 1/3 innings. Stults is 5-0 in seven starts since rejoining the starting rotation on August 6.	Garcia got pulled after only three innings, giving up four runs on seven hits. The lefty struck out four, walked three and had two wild pitches.	"A bad one," Garcia said. "I didn't get the job done. I was just getting the ball up. They've got a good lineup."	San Diego has won 14 of 18 overall and 18 of 24 at home.	The Cardinals had cut the lead to 6-3 when they loaded the bases with one out in the seventh inning. But Dale Thayer, who came in and gave up a single to Carlos Beltran to load the bases, got Matt Holliday to ground into a double play.	Rookie Pete Kozma put the Cardinals ahead on a two-run triple with two outs in the second. Kozma finished with three hits.	Game notes	 Garcia is 1-5 with an 8.32 ERA in his past six road starts. ... Cardinals RHP Lance Lynn will start Thursday night against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Lynn replaced RHP Jake Westbrook, who sustained a right oblique injury on Saturday. Matheny said the injury is not severe and said it looks as if Westbrook will pitch again this season. ... Padres closer Huston Street, on the DL since Aug. 11 (strained left calf) threw a simulated game. Black said the club will make a decision later in the week when Street will return. ... St. Louis 1B-OF Lance Berkman will have season-ending surgery on Tuesday on his ailing right knee. Berkman has just two homers and seven RBIs in 80 at-bats. .. Cardinals RHP Chris Carpenter threw around 70 pitches in a simulated game on Monday, keeping alive the hope he might pitch this season. Carpenter, 37, has not pitched because of a nerve condition in his right shoulder. ... St. Louis RHP Adam Wainwright (13-12, 4.04 ERA) faces San Diego RHP Edinson Volquez (9-10, 4.27) on Tuesday night.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

BALTIMORE --  For the second time in three games, the Baltimore Orioles had an uplifting victory marred by an injury to a key player.	J.J. Hardy homered twice, doubled and drove in five runs, and the Orioles defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 9-2 Tuesday night to move into a tie for the AL East lead.	But starting pitcher Jason Hammel left in the fourth inning with an injured right knee. The right-hander underwent arthroscopic surgery on that same knee in mid-July and was making his second start since returning from the disabled list.	Hammel will be examined Wednesday by the team surgeon. He said the sensation was exactly identical to what he felt in a July 13 game against Detroit, his last start before going on the DL.	"It's a very sharp pain in the knee in the same spot," Hammel said. "I'm hoping it is just scar tissue. I've been told scar tissue can react like that."	On Saturday, Baltimore lost right fielder Nick Markakis with a broken left thumb while defeating the New York Yankees. Both Hammel and Markakis were on the DL earlier this year.	"We've been down this road many times this year with a lot of different challenges," manager Buck Showalter said. "We've operated a good portion of this season without Ham and without Nicky, so we're kind of experienced at it anyway.  It's not the kind of experience you want to have."	Hammel had no problem with the knee on Thursday night against the Yankees, and retired 11 of 13 Tampa Bay batters before exiting.	"Against the Yankees, I felt great," Hammel said. "I felt like I was back on track, and I know I can help this team when I am healthy. So it's very frustrating."	Steve Johnson (3-0) got the win with 1 1/3 innings of hitless relief.	With Markakis out, Hardy picked up the slack. He went 4 for 5 to help Baltimore pull even atop the division with the Yankees, who lost 4-3 at Boston. The Rays are two games behind the co-leaders.	Hardy hit a two-run homer in the third inning, doubled and scored in the fifth, singled in a run in the sixth and added his 21st homer with a runner on in the eighth. It was his ninth career two-homer game, the second this season.	"I got a couple pitches to hit and didn't miss them," Hardy said.	Chris Davis homered and Matt Wieters had three hits and two RBIs for Baltimore.	Ryan Roberts and Elliot Johnson hit solo homers for Tampa Bay. It was the first time since Aug. 4 that the Rays lost by more than two runs; eight of their previous 12 defeats were by one run.	"Anybody can get beat by a lot of runs any night," Roberts said. "It didn't go our way tonight, and that's how it happens sometime in baseball."	Roberts left in the sixth inning with a left forearm strain, the result of a tag he made at second base. X-rays were negative, and he held out hope of playing Wednesday in the next game of the three-game series.	"I'm just glad it isn't broke," Roberts said. "If it's up to me, I'm playing. We're in a tight race and these games mean a lot, so I definitely want to play even if it's going to hurt a little bit."	Tampa Bay left-hander Matt Moore (10-10) threw 94 pitches over four innings before being lifted by manager Joe Maddon. Moore allowed two earned runs on four hits and three walks.	Burke Badenhop entered with a run of eight straight scoreless appearances and promptly gave up a double to Hardy, a single to Adam Jones and two-run double to Wieters that provided Baltimore with a 5-1 lead.	Hardy's sixth-inning RBI single came off Cesar Ramos and Davis hit his 25th homer in the seventh off J.P. Howell.	Johnson connected against Darren O'Day leading off the eighth, and Hardy homered off Dane De La Rosa in the bottom half.	The victory improved Baltimore's record against AL East foes to 33-24 compared to 28-44 last year.	Baltimore broke on top with an unearned run in the first inning. Jones walked and scored when Matt Joyce fumbled Wieters' two-out single to right.	Hammel retired the first eight batters before Roberts connected in the third. It was his fourth homer with Tampa Bay since in coming over in a trade with Arizona on July 24.	In the bottom half, Robert Andino led off with a double and Hardy homered to put the Orioles ahead for good.	Game notes	 Baltimore leads the season series 7-6 and took the lead in the all-time series, 127-126. ... The Orioles purchased the contracts of OFs Endy Chavez and L.J. Hoes and designated RHP Kevin Gregg and INF Ryan Adams for assignment. ... This was the first of 15 consecutive games against AL East foes for the Rays, who head to Yankee Stadium after this series. ... The Rays will send Alex Cobb to the mound Wednesday night and the Orioles will start rookie Miguel Gonzalez, who's 0-1 with a 6.52 ERA in two starts against Tampa Bay.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

PHILADELPHIA --  The streaking Philadelphia Phillies are playing better baseball and getting good breaks as they make a late playoff push.	Jimmy Rollins homered and drove in three runs and Roy Halladay won again as the Phillies outslugged the Miami Marlins 9-7 on Tuesday night for their sixth straight win.	Despite allowing five runs and seven hits in 6 1/3 innings, Halladay (10-7) improved to 4-0 in his last five starts. The right-hander walked three and struck out six.	Juan Pierre and Chase Utley both had three hits for Philadelphia, which finished with 15 hits while winning its 14th in the last 18 games. The five-time defending NL East champion Phillies, who reached .500 for the first time since June 4, are making a late playoff push. They began the day five games behind St. Louis in the NL wild-card race.	"Things have been going our way good," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said.	That was apparent in the sixth inning when Rollins looked to be out after popping up the ball behind home plate. But Marlins catcher Rob Brantly dropped the ball and Rollins followed the error by blasting the next pitch deep into the seats in right to give the Phillies an 8-3 lead.	"There are times we got breaks (this season) and weren't able to take advantage of it," Rollins said. "This time we were. It's more than that, though. We're executing, playing good defense, and getting good pitching and timely hitting. We know we needed to clean it up in many areas."	A smiling Rollins acknowledged a fun atmosphere in the Philadelphia clubhouse.	"You hear it's a cliche that this is what you play for, for September, but it's true," he said. "We have a lot of flags but we don't have a wild-card flag, so this would be a good time."	Giancarlo Stanton homered for Miami, which has lost nine of 13. Stanton went deep for the 14th time in his last 17 road games to up his league-leading road total to 21 homers.	"We didn't pitch well tonight and we continue to leave people in scoring position," Marlins manager Ozzie Guillen said. "The easy RBIs, we can't get them in when we need them."	That has not been the case for the Phillies over the last month.	"We've been playing clean games," Manuel said, "getting the pitching, getting hits when it counts and we've been catching the ball better."	Jonathan Papelbon pitched a scoreless ninth for his 33rd save in 37 chances. He was the last of 12 pitchers used in the game, with each team sending six to the mound.	The Phillies jumped in front 3-0 in the first inning, highlighted by RBI singles from Carlos Ruiz and Domonic Brown.	Miami closed within 3-2 in the third on an RBI single by Justin Ruggiano and sacrifice fly by Jose Reyes	Philadelphia got a run back in the bottom of the frame on Utley's RBI single, and then took a 5-2 lead in the fifth on Pierre's RBI single off Nate Eovaldi (4-12), who gave up five runs and eight hits in four-plus innings.	"I fell behind in counts and was missing with my fastball," Eovaldi said. "Overall, not a good outing."	Stanton launched Halladay's first pitch of the sixth inning deep into the seats in left to bring the Marlins within 5-3. It was Stanton's 34th homer, tying his career-high set last season.	Halladay got that run back himself in the bottom of the frame, lining a single up the middle off Chris Hatcher to drive in Michael Martinez who had doubled. It was the second RBI of the season for the light-hitting Halladay, who entered batting .152.	And Rollins followed with a two-run homer to right.	That looked to be plenty of runs for the Phillies, but the Marlins scored four against four pitchers in the seventh.	Halladay left after facing three batters, culminating when Bryan Petersen doubled home Brantly.	"The last two months have been a lot better," Halladay said of the team's play. "We have seen a lot of good things and we just want to keep it going."	After giving up an RBI single to Ruggiano, it looked as if reliever Josh Lindblom was going to end the inning but second baseman Utley had a sure double-play grounder go through his legs to extend the inning. The Marlins scored two more on RBI singles by Carlos Lee and Greg Dobbs, to get within 8-7.	Rollins' sacrifice fly in the bottom of the seventh scored John Mayberry Jr., who had doubled, and put Philadelphia ahead 9-7. The Phillies left the bases loaded when Ryan Howard flied out to center for the final out.	Game notes	 Ruiz, having a career year, was back in the starting lineup for the first time since Aug. 2. He was on the DL from Aug. 3 through last Friday with a left foot injury. ... Christopher Suprun, a paramedic and firefighter who was a first responder to the 9/11 attacks of the Pentagon, threw out the first pitch.

TORONTO --  Smiling wide after his first major league win, Erasmo Ramirez was on a mission to track down a memento from his milestone moment.	Kyle Seager homered and came within a triple of the cycle, Ramirez pitched seven sharp innings and the Seattle Mariners beat the Toronto Blue Jays 4-3 on Tuesday night.	"Erasmo pitched a fantastic ballgame," Mariners manager Eric Wedge said. "He did a great job with his fastball, mixed in his changeup as the game wore on and had a good breaking ball."	Starting for the first time since June 30, Ramirez (1-2) allowed two runs and six hits, setting down nine straight at one stretch. He walked one and struck out six.	"I was so happy with the last out, the 27th," Ramirez said. "I was waiting for that since I got here."	Ramirez, however, was still waiting for one more thing: an important keepsake.	"I went looking for the lineup," he said. "I don't know where it is, but I'm going to find it."	Four relievers combined to work the eighth and Tom Wilhelmsen closed it for his 25th save in 28 chances as Seattle snapped a three-game losing streak.	Seager went 3 for 5. He had an RBI single in the first, doubled and scored in the third and homered in the fifth, his 18th.	"He's had big hits at big times for us," Wedge said of Seager, who leads the team with 81 RBIs.	The victory was Seattle's 68th, one more than they had last season. The Mariners finished with 14 hits, five for extra bases.	"We swung the bats really well," Wedge said. "I would like to have seen us put a few more tallies up there, but that doesn't take away from the way we swung the bats. We had a lot of hits and a lot of hard outs."	Most of the damage came off Toronto's Brandon Morrow (8-6), who matched a career high by allowing 11 hits as the Blue Jays failed to extend their winning streak to five games.	Morrow came in 3-0 with a 1.89 ERA in three career starts against the team that drafted him, but was in trouble from the start, giving up two runs and four hits in a shaky first inning. Seager singled home the first run and, two batters later, Michael Saunders made it 2-0 with a hit to left. John Jaso tried to score from second on the play, but was thrown out at the plate by Rajai Davis.	"We were ready for the fastball," Gutierrez said of Seattle's approach to Morrow. "He's a power pitcher and obviously we need to get on the fastball first and that's what we did."	Morrow, who allowed four runs in 4 2/3 innings, conceded that that Mariners had feasted on his fastball.	"The only thing that kept that from being eight runs was probably my changeup," he said. "I had a decent changeup and was able to keep them off-balance a little bit that way."	While the Mariners may have focused on Morrow's fastball, Seager said that didn't necessarily make it any easier.	"His off speed is so good, you've kind of got to pick your poison because he throws 95, too," Seager said.	Toronto got one back off Ramirez in the bottom half on Yunel Escobar's RBI single, but Adam Lind was thrown out trying to go from first to third, ending the rally.	Morrow got the Mariners in order in the second but ran into trouble again in the third. Jaso made it 3-1 with an RBI single but was thrown out on the bases by Davis for a second time when he tried to go from first to third on Jesus Montero's single to left.	Seager's leadoff homer in the fifth made it 4-2, but the Blue Jays cut it to one with a run in the eighth. Colby Rasmus doubled off Charlie Furbush, who was replaced by Josh Kinney. Edwin Encarnacion flied out, with Rasmus advancing to third. Lucas Luetge came on to face pinch-hitter Moises Sierra, who hit an RBI groundout. Stephen Pryor took over for Luetge and ended the inning by striking out Escobar.	Seattle center fielder Franklin Gutierrez made a rare error on Kelly Johnson's deep fly ball to begin the bottom of the seventh. For Gutierrez, the miscue was his first in 301 games. He had gone 846 chances without an error, an AL record for outfielders.	Wedge said Gutierrez couldn't recover after getting turned around on the play.	"It's just one of those things that happen, for him once in about three years," Wedge said.

Toronto Police and Fire officials took part in pregame ceremonies to mark the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks. .. Attendance was 12,935, Toronto's smallest crowd this season.

BOSTON --  Excited Red Sox players poured from the dugout. Jacoby Ellsbury had a huge smile after his game-winning single. Pedro Ciriaco jumped for joy after sliding home with the deciding run.	And losing pitcher David Robertson walked slowly to the dugout after the New York Yankees missed a chance to keep sole possession of first place in the AL East, losing to Boston 4-3 on Tuesday night.	"That was a great feeling," said Ellsbury, who had four hits on his 29th birthday. "The fans were great tonight. They were into the game, energetic, and we just want to keep putting on a show for them."	His hit provided a rare moment of celebration for the Red Sox, losers of 11 of 13 games and consigned to the role of trying to ruin the playoff chances of other teams in the division. On Tuesday, they did it against their traditional rivals.	"With the Yankees in town, they're battling for a (playoff) spot, and at this point we can just go out and try to play spoiler," left fielder Cody Ross said. "We don't care who we play. We just want to win."	The loss left the Yankees and Orioles tied with 79-62 records. Baltimore beat Tampa Bay 9-2 on Tuesday night. The Rays are two back in the division.	"You wouldn't be tied for first unless you found ways to win games throughout the course of 140-something games that we've played," Derek Jeter said. "So we've got to do it again."	But he knows the Red Sox would like to win the remaining two games of the series even if they are in last place.	"When you compete and you want to win, I don't care where you are in the standings," he said. "Especially when it's Red Sox-Yankees, guys want to play well."	Ciriaco has done that against the Yankees. He went 2-for-3 on Tuesday and is 17-for-35 in nine games in his career against New York, all with Boston this season.	"He was struggling a little bit, I heard, coming in, too," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "He hits a ball at his shoe tops to lead off the ninth. I mean, he just finds a way against us."	That hit with one out found the hole and went into left field. Mike Aviles then singled between shortstop and third base. Jeter fielded the ball but held it, as he had no chance to get either Ciriaco or Aviles. Then Ellsbury lined his decisive single to right field. Ichiro Suzuki fired the ball home, but Ciriaco slid in ahead of the tag by Russell Martin.	"Ciri and Mike did a good job of getting in scoring position," Ellsbury said. "I knew if I hit something to the outfield, Ciri's going to score with his speed."	Andrew Bailey (1-0) got the win after allowing one hit in one inning.	"Today was probably some of the most fun we've had in a while," he said.	Robertson (1-7) retired his first four batters before Boston rallied. Ellsbury's hit came on a changeup that stayed up.	"I was hoping to get the ball down and maybe get him to roll it over, maybe into a double-play ball," Robertson said. "When you make a bad pitch, things can happen."	The Red Sox wasted a chance in the seventh when they loaded the bases with one out and couldn't score. But they got outstanding work from their bullpen, which allowed just a hit and a walk with four strikeouts in 3 2/3 innings.	Dustin Pedroia tied the game for Boston in the sixth with a solo shot, his 15th of the year and third hit of the game.	The Yankees took a 3-2 lead in the top half on a two-run, ground-rule double by Jeter after a walk to Curtis Granderson, a single by Andruw Jones and a sacrifice by Jayson Nix.	Boston starter Jon Lester walked three -- of his career-high seven -- in the first when the Yankees took a 1-0 lead. Jeter led off with a walk, took third on a double by Nick Swisher and scored on a groundout by Robinson Cano.	Lester walked the first two batters in the third and the leadoff hitter in the fourth but retired the next three batters in each inning. Then he struck out the side in the fifth, giving him 1,045 career strikeouts, the most by a Red Sox lefty. Bruce Hurst had the old mark of 1,044.	The Red Sox took a 2-1 lead in the third on a double by Ciriaco and RBI singles by Ellsbury and Pedroia.	Game notes	 Lester's previous career high was five walks on nine different occasions, most recently on July 22 in a 15-7 loss to Toronto in which he allowed 11 runs. ... Carl Yastrzemski is the only other Red Sox player since 1918 with four hits on his birthday. He did it in 1961 and 1976. ... Yankees LHP Andy Pettitte is scheduled to throw in a simulated game Wednesday. He's trying to work his way back into the rotation after breaking his ankle June 28. Pettitte hopes to throw about 60 pitches. ... Injured 1B Mark Teixeira also was with the club even though he is sidelined for up to two weeks with a strained left calf, an injury he aggravated Saturday. "I think we can get plenty of work done here," Teixeira said. ... Swisher snapped an 0-for-28 slump with his double in the first. ... David Phelps (3-4) pitches for the Yankees against Aaron Cook (3-9) in the second game of the three-game series on Wednesday night. ... Yankees starter Hiroki Kuroda issued no walks and has just 14 in his past 15 starts.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CINCINNATI -- Another win over a fading pursuer has Reds second baseman Brandon Phillips thinking about a really big number.	Phillips homered and drove in a pair of runs Tuesday night, and Mike Leake pitched seven innings and scored off a dash home on a wild pitch, setting up a 5-3 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates that moved Cincinnati another step closer to the NL Central title.	"I'm trying to get to 100 wins and the No. 1 seed," Phillips said, referring to the playoffs. "A hundred wins would be nice. A hundred wins would be a beautiful thing. I think it would be a great accomplishment."	It would be something of a long shot -- at 86-57, they'd have to win 14 of their last 19 games. They also would have to overtake Washington (88-54) for the top seed in the playoffs.	Another grind-it-out win on Tuesday kept them thinking big. Both teams were recovering from their 5-hour, 22-minute game on Monday night, won by the Reds 4-3 in 14 innings.	Cincinnati didn't show any after-effects.	"We played a very good game tonight in all phases," manager Dusty Baker said.	Leake (8-9) gave up nine hits, including Alex Presley's solo homer and pinch hitter Gaby Sanchez's two-run shot. Leake singled and eventually scored during a decisive three-run second inning off Kevin Correia (10-9) aided by an error.	The Pirates have lost five in a row and 22 out of 31, falling out of contention in the NL Central. They trail the Reds by a season-high 13 games.	The deep slump also has left them at risk of extending their unmatched streak of futility. The Pirates haven't had a winning record for the last 19 seasons, a record for a North American pro team. The loss on Tuesday dropped them to 72-69.	"We've had some opportunities," Correia said. "We're getting close. But we've got to just keep fighting. We're not on a good run right now, but it can very easily turn around with one game. I think everybody knows that."	The NL Central leaders will get by the next few days without closer Aroldis Chapman, who has a tired pitching shoulder. He walked three of the five batters he faced on Monday night, when his velocity was down from 100 mph to the mid-90s.	Jonathan Broxton, acquired from Kansas City at the trade deadline, assumes the role. He pitched the ninth, allowing a hit, for his first save in three tries with the Reds. He had 23 saves with the Royals.	Before the game, Phillips talked to Pirates reliever Jared Hughes to ease hard feelings. Hughes hit Phillips with a pitch on Monday night, and Phillips got the ball and flipped it at the mound. Phillips thought he heard the reliever make a derogatory comment, but on Tuesday he said they talked and cleared up "a big misunderstanding."	Hughes released a statement saying any comments he made were not "in any way connected to race. It is not how I was raised and not who I am as a person," Hughes said.	Reds third baseman Scott Rolen was back after being out of the starting lineup the last five games with a sore back. He hit his seventh homer of the season in the eighth inning, his first since Aug. 15.	With the score tied at 1, Leake helped himself in the second inning after Dioner Navarro drew a walk. Leake failed to get down a bunt on the first two pitches, then swung away and singled. Phillips' double scored Navarro and sent Leake to third.	When Correia's pitch bounced away from catcher Michael McKenry, Leake dashed home and scored with a hard, feet-first slide. Phillips followed him home when McKenry retrieved the ball and threw wildly to the plate.	"I don't know if the ball hit my leg or not," Leake said. "Fortunately, Brandon was able to come around."	That wasn't the end of the Pirates' self destruction.	With Clint Barmes on second base in the fifth inning, Correia tried to sacrifice but popped up his bunt for an easy out. Brock Holt then singled to right and rounded the base too far -- first baseman Joey Votto cut off the throw and flipped to Phillips covering the base to get the rookie.	"That was just a heads-up play," Phillips said. "He's going around the base hard, trying to force the cut-off in case their guy's trying to score. I was able to sneak in behind him. I was being the sneaky player I am. That was a key out. I felt like that was the game."	Game notes	 Reds SS Zack Cozart was out of the lineup for a seventh straight game with a strained oblique. ... Phillips hit Correia's first pitch for his fourth career leadoff homer and the fifth by the Reds this season. ... Holt extended his hitting streak to seven games. ... Leake has four multihit games this season and nine for his career. He has 43 hits over the last three seasons, the most by any pitcher in the majors.

NEW YORK --  Bryce Harper had looked so bad all season against R.A. Dickey's dancing knuckleball that he didn't even expect to play Tuesday night.	Nationals manager Davey Johnson had a different idea.	Harper had his first four-hit game and pinch-hitter Tyler Moore launched a go-ahead homer off Dickey in the seventh inning to send Washington past the punchless New York Mets 5-3.	After entering 0 for 10 with six strikeouts against Dickey, Harper doubled and singled twice off the All-Star pitcher. The talented rookie added an RBI single in the ninth off Josh Edgin to become the first teenager with four hits in a major league game since Andruw Jones did it for Atlanta on Sept. 22, 1996.	"Now he realizes he can hit a knuckleball," Johnson said.	Leadoff batter Jayson Werth reached base all five times for the NL East leaders, who have won seven straight and 11 of 12 at Citi Field.	Harper credited Werth's fine at-bats in front of him for helping him solve Dickey. Werth is 13 for 27 (.481) with two homers, three doubles and five walks against Dickey -- attributing his success to all the Wiffle Ball he played as a kid.	"Just trying to see something up or see a pitch I can square up," Harper said. "I've tried everything against that guy."	Looking for a win over baseball's top team to boost his Cy Young Award resume, Dickey (18-5) mostly pitched out of trouble for seven solid innings. But he gave up a two-run shot to Moore that made it 3-2 in the seventh and was unable to tie Nationals lefty Gio Gonzalez for the major league lead in wins.	Gonzalez beat the Mets 5-1 in the series opener Monday.	Not surprisingly, Dickey got little help from his teammates at the plate. The fading Mets, losers of five in a row and seven of eight, set a club record by failing to score more than three runs for the 12th consecutive home game. The last time they managed four runs at Citi Field was Aug. 12 in a 6-5 win over Atlanta.	New York has dropped 21 of its last 25 in Queens and is 0-5 on a six-game homestand against Atlanta and Washington. The Nationals improved to 13-4 against the Mets this season.	Tom Gorzelanny (4-2) worked a hitless sixth in relief of a shaky Jordan Zimmermann, who labored through 104 pitches over five innings. Christian Garcia struck out three of his four batters and Tyler Clippard allowed a solo homer to pinch-hitter Scott Hairston in the ninth before securing his 31st save in 34 attempts.	Kurt Suzuki also had an RBI single in the ninth for Washington (88-54).	"That's the best lineup I've faced. They're just so functional," Dickey said.	After going an absurd 110 straight innings at home without scoring more than one run, the Mets finally put up a crooked number in the fifth.	Ruben Tejada singled for the third time and scored easily from first when Daniel Murphy's slicing double took an odd carom off the retaining wall in medium left field. Murphy clapped his hands at second base, Dickey cheered from the dugout and then David Wright grounded an RBI single under the glove of a diving Ian Desmond at shortstop.	Suddenly given a 2-1 lead, Dickey soon gave it back. Suzuki singled with one out in the seventh and Moore drove the next pitch to left for his ninth home run in 138 at-bats this season.	"I had a mediocre knuckleball and had to pitch with it," Dickey said. "At this point in the season, you want to give the fans something. We've got a shot at doing something, maybe."	Harper shortened his big swing against Dickey, hitting the ball on the ground all four times. After fouling off a bunt attempt, the 19-year-old slugger chopped a double inside third base to set up Ryan Zimmerman's sacrifice fly in the first.	"I think I was fortunate to get a couple knocks tonight," Harper said. "You can't really get any advice on that guy. He's got a knuckleball. That's what he throws. You either hit it or you don't."	Johnson smiled in the dugout after Harper's third hit. Before the game, he explained his decision to start the youngster.	"He's going to have to learn how to hit a knuckleball. It's too early to be dodging anybody," Johnson said. "Bryce has had a day off and he doesn't need one. He's stronger and younger than anybody out there. And that knuckleball might find his bat. It may take a wrong little knuckle and go right into his bat, and I know he's going to be swinging hard enough, it could cause some damage. So I'm willing to take that chance and have him in the lineup."	Zimmerman became the first Nationals player with an RBI in eight consecutive games. He also singled in the eighth, extending his hitting streak to 15 games.	In a tradition that began after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the Mets wore caps commemorating the NYPD, FDNY and other first responders during batting practice and the national anthem.	The Nationals wore their special blue game jerseys with stars and stripes, and both teams lined up along the baselines for a moment of silence before the first pitch.	Game notes	 Johnson plans to give LF Michael Morse (sore right hand) a couple of days off. ... LHP Sean Burnett (elbow) could be available Wednesday. ... Johnson said he met New York quarterbacks Eli Manning and Mark Sanchez at a charity function near the World Trade Center site Tuesday morning. "It's just a great cause," the manager said. "It was nice to be there." ... It was Moore's second pinch-hit home run. ... Nationals LHP John Lannan, from nearby Long Beach, will make his first start at Citi Field since April 2010 when he faces Mets rookie Matt Harvey in the series finale Wednesday night.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Matt Harrison got some extra rest and finally his 16th victory for the AL West-leading Texas Rangers.	Harrison got into the sixth inning and Adrian Beltre was awarded his 31st homer after a replay review, leading the Rangers to a 6-4 victory over the struggling Cleveland Indians on Tuesday night.	Harrison (16-9), pitching seven days after his second consecutive loss, didn't allow a runner until the fourth and struck out six over 5 2/3 innings.	"The first three innings, he was as sharp as he could possibly be," manager Ron Washington said. "All of a sudden, he was not as crisp as he was, and it was three innings in a row. But he got us into the sixth. For a minute, I thought he'd go way deep in the game without a lot of pitches."	Texas scored four times in the second, which started with Beltre reaching on an error that led to three unearned runs. One of those runs scored on the 16th wild pitch by Ubaldo Jimenez (9-16), who has the most losses and wild pitches in the majors.	Joe Nathan, who began the day in a Tony Romo uniform, worked a perfect ninth for his 32nd save. The right-hander has converted a career-high 30 chances in a row, a Rangers record.	Cleveland, which dropped to 15-42 since the All-Star break, was still searching for its first baserunner before Shin-Soo Choo and Jason Kipnis opened the fourth with consecutive walks. Harrison got out of that jam with a double-play grounder and a strikeout.	"Definitely a lot better than the last two," said Harrison, an All-Star left-hander who allowed 10 earned runs in 10 innings over his previous two starts. "Those extra two days definitely helped get my legs back under me."	Brent Lillibridge drew a one-out walk in the fifth before Jason Donald singled for Cleveland's first hit. Lillibridge scored on Ezequiel Carrera's RBI single.	The Rangers opened their six-game homestand three games ahead of Oakland, matching their smallest division lead since the All-Star break. The A's played late Tuesday night at the Los Angeles Angels.	With general manager Chris Antonetti on hand for the final series of their 10-game trip, the Indians played pretty much the same way they have for nearly four months.	"Things haven't gone right the whole second half. We're battling, we're keeping our head up and trying to finish strong," manager Manny Acta said. "But the whole second half has been rough for us."	Harrison allowed five hits and walked three, all the runners coming in his last 2 2/3 innings. He became the fourth AL pitcher with 16 wins.	Jimenez is 1-9 in 12 starts since the All-Star break. The Indians are 37-67 since they led the AL Central by four games on May 17, and have the AL's worst record at 59-83.	Jimenez struck out four and walked four while allowing five runs (only two earned) and four hits over five innings.	Beltre led off the fifth with a ball that ricocheted high off the top of the left-field wall and was initially ruled a double. Umpires reviewed the play and changed it to a homer. The replay showed the ball actually hit a metal brace supporting the wall and not the padding on top of it.	"The way it bounced ... it had to hit something," Washington said.	Beltre wasn't sure after seeing the ball bounce back on the field. He waited at second base for the umpires to come back on the field, then finished rounding the bases once they signaled home run.	"We thought the ball hit the top of the wall and came back," Acta said. "In the replays we have here it looks kind of inconclusive. Talking to the umpire, he felt it hit some metal bar back there behind the padding."	Nathan, a New York Giants fan, paid off a bet with Dallas Cowboys fan and fellow reliever Mike Adams by donning the full Romo No. 9 uniform, including pads and football cleats, during batting practice. It was the Rangers' first home game since the Cowboys' season-opening 24-17 victory at the Giants last Wednesday.	Elvis Andrus had an RBI single in the sixth for Texas, but Cleveland scored twice in the eighth against three relievers. Both runs were charged to Adams, who was struck on the back of his right calf by a ball.	Harrison was pulled after Russ Canzler singled with two down and scored on Matt LaPorta's double that bounced off the center-field wall, trimming the Rangers' lead to 5-2.	"With the four-run lead, I pitched to contact and not as aggressive," Harrison said. "I left a couple over the plate."	Game notes	 Indians LF Thomas Neal was ruled out in the seventh for interference. He hit a dribbler down the first-base line fielded by reliever Alexi Ogando, who shot-putted the ball over the runner and into right field. But home plate umpire Ed Hickox immediately signaled that Neal was out of the running lane. ... Texas OF Nelson Cruz, in a 2-for-23 slide, got the night off. Cruz was 0 for 9 with seven strikeouts in his career against Jimenez, but Washington said the timing of the planned break was a coincidence. ... Rangers RHP Roy Oswalt, who left Sunday's start after two innings, has been diagnosed with a right forearm strain and won't throw for two to three days. He will be re-evaluated after that.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

HOUSTON --  Tony DeFrancesco believes rewarding his team for good performances is important.	So Houston's interim manager decided he would gift a pair of $200 headphones to one standout player in each Astros win.	He left the ballpark on Tuesday night $1,000 lighter after handing out five pairs due to all the contributions in the 1-0 win over the Chicago Cubs.	"I want these guys to understand that performance is important here and keeping the culture in here and keeping the life," he said of his last-place team. "It's been a rough season for some of these guys and they've been beat down for almost two years and I'm just trying to keep them positive and keep the energy."	Justin Maxwell, who drove in the game's only run on a sacrifice fly and made a play that kept Chicago from tying the game got a pair. Relievers Wilton Lopez, Wesley Wright, Xavier Cedeno and Jose Valdez also snagged the headphones.	Jimmy Paredes singled and scored an unearned run in the third inning to help in the win.	It was an otherwise tough night for the second baseman, who committed three errors. Paredes has started the past three games at second base with All-Star Jose Altuve out with an abdominal strain.	Houston starter Jordan Lyles (4-11) scattered two hits and struck out five in five innings and five relievers completed the shutout. Lopez allowed two hits in a scoreless ninth for his fourth save.	It was the first six-pitcher shutout for the Astros since Houston used six pitchers in a no-hitter against the Yankees on June 11, 2003, and just the third in franchise history.	The bullpen combined to allow four hits and struck out six.	The last error by Paredes came in the seventh inning, and DeFrancesco lifted him for Altuve to start the eighth.	Cubs starter Justin Germano (2-7) allowed three hits and tied a career high with eight strikeouts. He lost his fifth straight start.	Paredes singled with one out in the third before Fernando Martinez reached on an error by catcher Steve Clevenger when he threw the ball over the head of first baseman Bryan LaHair.	Brett Wallace walked to load the bases and Houston took the lead on a sacrifice fly by Justin Maxwell.	The Cubs went 0 for 10 with runners in scoring position to break a season-high-tying four-game winning streak.	"It was a shame we got that kind of pitching from everybody and had plenty of chances to score and couldn't get a hit when it counted it," Chicago manager Dale Sveum said.	Two walks and a single by LaHair loaded the bases for the Cubs with one out in the second. They came away empty when Germano grounded into a forceout that left Clevenger out at home before Lyles struck out David DeJesus.	Another missed opportunity came in the sixth when Starlin Castro singled before a one-out double by pinch-hitter Dave Sappelt. But pinch-hitter Darwin Barney was out on a fly ball to Maxwell in center field and his throw to third beat Sappelt for the double play before Castro made it home.	"I was really surprised that he went," Maxwell said of Sappelt. "I knew I had no shot at the plate and I kind of peeked as I was catching the ball and I thought he was going to stop running all the way to third, but he kept going and (Matt) Dominguez made a great tag and got him out."	Cubs slugger Anthony Rizzo was injured in the third inning in a collision with Brett Wallace. Rizzo hit a grounder to Paredes in the third inning, and his throw to first was high, causing Wallace to jump to try and catch it. Rizzo collided with Wallace while he was in the air and tumbled violently to the ground.	He remained on the dirt for a minute while trainers looked at him. He finally sat up and slowly walked off the field with the help of the trainers. He has a sore right shoulder and upper back and the Cubs are going to monitor him for the next couple of days.	"I was just stunned, dazed, at first. That's why at first I didn't move," Rizzo said. "I'm more sore than anything  ...  it was an ugly fall."	Game notes	 Houston activated SS Jed Lowrie before Monday night's game, but he did not play. He has been on the DL since July 15 with an injured nerve in his right leg. ... Castro had an error in the eighth inning, his 24th of the season, which is the most among NL shortstops.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

MILWAUKEE --  It took the Milwaukee Brewers more than four months to reach the break-even point, and they have no intention of stopping there.	Marco Estrada pitched shutout ball into the seventh inning, Rickie Weeks and Aramis Ramirez homered and the Brewers beat the Atlanta Braves 5-0 on Tuesday night.	The Brewers won their eighth in a row at Miller Park and got back to the .500 mark for the first time since April 24. Milwaukee has surged back into the NL wild-card race by winning 17 of 22, and beat the wild-card-leading Braves for the second straight day.	"We're playing great baseball and we know we have the team to go all the way," Estrada said. "A lot of people doubted us when we were down, but we didn't lose any confidence. We knew how well we could play."	Estrada (3-6) was dominant from the start, allowing only two singles to Andrelton Simmons in the first five innings.	Estrada allowed four hits in 6 2/3 innings and struck out six.	It was a bounce-back start for Estrada, who gave up four runs in five innings in last Thursday's 6-2 loss to Miami.	"I felt very good out there tonight," he said. "I was really locked in and I had great defense behind me."	One of those key defensive plays came in the seventh inning. After a one-out single by Dan Uggla, Lyle Overbay hit a drive into the gap and right fielder Norichka Aoki made a leaping catch to prevent an extra-base hit.	After the grab, Estrada jumped up the air and pumped his fist.	"I was so excited because that was such a great catch," he said.	Aoki said he knew he could get to the ball as soon as it was hit.	"I had to jump to get it because I am not as tall as everyone else," Aoki said through a translator. "We have a very good team and we've felt all along that we can win these games."	Four Milwaukee pitchers combined on a five-hitter. Brewers manager Ron Roenicke said he was thrilled to get back to .500, but wants to keep the run going.	"It is nice to get there, but is more important in the way we are playing right now," he said. "Our pitching has been outstanding, we're getting clutch hits from a lot of different people and we are playing very good defense."	Tim Hudson (14-6) was almost as good as Estrada for the Braves early in the game. Other than Rickie Weeks' 18th home run in the first, he allowed only an infield single to Jean Segura in his first five innings.	Hudson gave up four runs and seven hits in 6 2/3 innings.	"I thought I pitched better than giving up all those runs late," he said. "Four runs seemed like a dozen the way their guys were throwing. It was just one of those games."	Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez said his team had several long outs, including Uggla's long drive in the seventh inning.	"We swung the bats hard, but couldn't get it off the wall or in front of the wall to get some runs," he said. "We're not feeling too good right now with the way we're swinging the bats."	The Brewers broke away in the seventh by scoring three times. Segura drove in the first run with a grounder, pinch hitter Taylor Green had an RBI single and Aoki doubled home another run.	Aramis Ramirez hit his 23rd home run in the eighth for the Brewers.	Game notes	 Brewers 1B Corey Hart was out of the starting lineup for the second straight game with plantar fascia on his left foot. He is listed as day-to-day and Roenicke is hopeful he will be able to play Wednesday against the Braves. ... Gonzalez said RHP Ben Sheets felt no pain Tuesday, one day after throwing a simulated game. Gonzalez said Sheets, who has been on the disabled list with right shoulder inflammation since Aug. 26, could be activated either Wednesday or Friday. ... Brewers RHP Yvonia Gallardo (14-8) will face Braves LHP Paul Maholm (12-9) in the series finale.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Will Smith is probably auditioning for a spot in Kansas City's rotation next season.	Having Salvador Perez as his catcher sure helps his cause.	Smith pitched seven shutout innings, Eric Hosmer homered and the Royals beat the Minnesota Twins 9-1 on Tuesday night.	Lorenzo Cain had two RBIs and was a home run away from the cycle as Kansas City beat Minnesota for just the sixth time in 16 games.	Perez extended his hitting streak to a career-best 15 games and threw out two runners trying to steal in support of Smith (5-7), who struck out a career-high seven and gave up seven hits in his first win in four starts.	"That guy's awesome," Smith said about Perez. "He's so good. You love having him back there. You feel confident that the running game, he's just going to completely shut it down."	Ryan Doumit had the Twins' RBI and Ben Revere had three hits.	Joe Mauer was in the initial starting lineup, but was scratched after experiencing back spasms before batting practice.	The atmosphere at Target Field brought back memories of the Metrodome, and not only because of all the empty seats for a September game featuring two teams out of contention.	With two outs and two runners on in the second inning, Cain hit a towering fly to left field. Josh Willingham lost it in the sky, holding out his hands as the ball fell 15 feet behind him and both runners scored.	Outfielders losing flyballs was a common occurrence under the white Teflon roof of the Metrodome, but hasn't been a problem under the lights at Target Field.	"It was just the time of day. It's frustrating when you can't see the ball," Willingham said. "You can't catch it if you can't see it. Can't see it, it's pretty helpless."	The miscue didn't help Scott Diamond (11-7) get back on track.	The left-hander allowed four runs and 10 hits over six innings and has just one victory in his last six starts.	The first two Twins batters reached in the first, fourth and fifth innings, but they couldn't break through against Smith.	Perez threw out basestealers to help erase the threats in the first and fifth, and Smith got Doumit to ground into a double play and struck out Trevor Plouffe to end the fourth.	The Twins had 16 stolen bases in their last 11 games, but were no match for Perez's strong arm and quick release. Jamey Carroll and Darin Mastroianni fell victim to Perez on Tuesday.	"It kept the momentum on our side," manager Ned Yost said about Perez, who has caught 11 of the last 21 runners trying to steal on him.	Cain got hit in the head by reliever Luis Perdomo in the eighth.	The ball appeared to hit Cain in the back of his helmet as he ducked, but Cain sat up quickly and remained in the game after sitting in the batter's box and getting checked out by trainers.	"The guys definitely let me know I was a home run away from the cycle," Cain said. "I was looking for a pitch to drive and ended up getting hit in the head. I went down for a second, but I'll be fine. Bounced back up and I'll be ready to go tomorrow."	Cain also said the back of his head was a little sore and he had a light headache.	The Royals scored five runs in the eighth and ninth, capped by Hosmer's 14th home run.	Alcides Escobar added two hits and two RBIs.	Game notes	 Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said center fielder Denard Span, out since Aug. 28 with a sprained SC joint, could return on Wednesday when he is eligible to come off the disabled list. ... Twins right fielder Chris Parmelee missed his second straight game with a groin injury and is day to day. ... Smith won for the first time since Aug. 15. ... The Twins announced a crowd of 28,993 on Tuesday. Monday's crowd of 27,526 was the lowest in Target Field history. ... Luke Hochevar (7-13, 5.35) pitches for Kansas City on Wednesday. The former No. 1 overall draft pick needs four strikeouts to match his career high of 128 set last season. ... P.J. Walters (2-3, 6.05) starts for Minnesota. Walters allowed five runs on Sept. 5 against the Chicago White Sox, his first start since coming off the disabled list.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

DENVER --  Madison Bumgarner had all sorts of trouble throwing his fastball. He had no problems hitting one.	The young lefty hit a three-run homer on a night when he struggled on the mound, and the San Francisco Giants held on for a 9-8 win over the Colorado Rockies in rainy conditions Tuesday.	"I'm all for helping us win. But my job is to go out there and pitch, not to hit," Bumgarner said. "I'd like to go out there and pitch better than that."	Bumgarner was roughed up by the Rockies, allowing five runs and 11 hits in 4 1/3 innings. Still, he gave the Giants a big boost with his bat, sending a 93 mph fastball from Jhoulys Chacin into the left-field seats.	Sitting on that fastball?	"I'm just trying to hit the baseball," he said.	It's definitely a pitch Chacin would love to have back.	"I know he's a good hitter, and in those situations you can't miss your spot," Chacin said. "It was a really bad pitch to him."	Brandon Belt had a big night at the plate as well, breaking a tie in the fifth with a two-run double. He also brought in a run on a fielder's choice and added a solo homer for the NL West leaders, who are 20-7 on the road since the All-Star break.	With Bumgarner's early exit, the Giants' bullpen picked up the slack and allowed just one run heading into the ninth.	But that's when things got interesting. Sergio Romo entered the game and allowed a two-out, two-run homer to pinch hitter Tyler Colvin. Lefty Javier Lopez was then summoned to face Jason Giambi and got the slugger to pop up to end the game.	Like that, the Giants gained another game on the Los Angeles Dodgers, who lost 1-0 to Arizona. San Francisco now has a six-game cushion with 20 to play.	"A lot of baseball still," manager Bruce Bochy cautioned. "We've got to keep focused on what we're doing. We've got our hands full right now."	After a shaky outing from Chacin, Carlos Torres (4-2) took over in the fifth and promptly ran into trouble. Belt gave the Giants the lead for good when he doubled off the glove of Carlos Gonzalez in left. As the ball rolled into the corner, Marco Scutaro and Buster Posey came around to score.	"I thought he was going to come back with a fastball and that's what he did," Belt explained. "He put it in a place I could handle, I put a good one on it and it fell in for me."	Chris Nelson, Wilin Rosario, Jordan Pacheco, Matt McBride and Gonzalez all had RBI singles for the Rockies.	Down 4-0 in the fourth, the Giants rallied to tie it. The big blow was Bumgarner's three-run shot -- a no-doubter, too, as Gonzalez briefly turned to give chase before watching it leave the park.	Bumgarner's only other major league homer came three months ago against Houston.	"It kind of turned the tables a little bit," Rockies manager Jim Tracy said. "That's not the first time that I've sat there and seen him square up a mislocated fastball. We've seen that before."	While Bumgarner shined at the plate -- also lacing a single -- he never found a groove on the mound. That's unusual for Bumgarner in this park, where he had allowed just two earned runs in his past three starts at Coors Field.	Giants reliever George Kontos (2-1) picked up the win by bailing the Giants out of a tight spot in the fifth with two strikeouts.	The quirky Colorado weather befuddled the Giants in the third inning. With San Francisco about to bat, the wind and rain moved in, making the conditions almost look like swirling snow. Chacin yielded two singles, but wiggled out of the jam when Pablo Sandoval flew out.	Then, in the bottom half of the inning, the rain all but vanished.	And the Rockies took full advantage of the change in weather. Chacin ignited a three-run inning with a leadoff double. He later scored when Josh Rutledge hit into a double play. Bumgarner then gave up four straight hits, including run-scoring singles to Rosario and Pacheco.	Colorado scored a run in the second on Nelson's RBI single. Bumgarner escaped any further trouble by getting DJ LeMahieu to hit into an inning-ending double play.	Game notes	 The Giants reinstated RHP Clay Hensley (groin) from the disabled list. ... RHP Tim Lincecum (8-14) will start Wednesday against LHP Jeff Francis (5-4). ... Dodgers OF Angel Pagan had his 12th triple of the season. It ties Steve Finley (2006) and Willie Mays (1960) for most in the San Francisco-era history for a single season. ... LHP Jorge De La Rosa (elbow) threw 3 2/3 innings and gave up one run Monday for Class-A Modesto. "He feels as normal as anyone would feel (the day after) they've started a game," Tracy said. "I heard nothing about his arm, his elbow. It's all very encouraging."	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PHOENIX --  Ian Kennedy has been maddeningly inconsistent in the follow-up year to his 21-win season.	His performance Tuesday night was a reminder of how good he can be.	Kennedy pitched neatly into the eighth inning and the Arizona Diamondbacks used an unearned run to beat Clayton Kershaw and the Los Angeles Dodgers, 1-0.	It was the first 1-0 victory of the season for the Diamondbacks, who needed left fielder Jason Kubel to rob Luis Cruz of a two-run homer with a leaping grab at the wall to end the fifth inning.	The lone run came in the seventh, when Paul Goldschmidt reached on shortstop Hanley Ramirez's throwing error and scored from first on Miguel Montero's double.	With San Francisco's win at Colorado, the Dodgers fell six games behind the first-place Giants in the NL West. Arizona ended a six-game home losing streak.	Kennedy (13-11) gave up four hits in 7 1/3 innings, striking out six and walking none.	"Really what made my fastball better was the execution of my off-speed pitches," Kennedy said. "I was throwing those for strikes, and when you do that, it's going to be a good game -- at least you give your team a chance. You've got to against Kershaw; he's one of the best pitchers in the game."	Kershaw (12-9) allowed three hits, striking out five and walking three in seven innings.	"I blinked first tonight," Kershaw said. "I threw a pitch I shouldn't have. I didn't put it where I wanted to and Miguel did a good job with it and made me pay for it. You can't blink first in those games and I did."	Montero said he hit a slider a little over the plate. It was about the only hard-hit ball off of Kershaw.	"That was the best he's looked in the times we've faced him this year," Montero said. "He had everything going. I ran into one pitch and that was the difference. But his stuff was very, very good."	Kershaw is 0-3 in his past three starts despite allowing a combined three earned runs. The Dodgers have lost all three games.	"It hurts when he pitches so good and we don't get a win," Los Angeles manager Don Mattingly said.	But, Kershaw said, "They all hurt the same right now."	Regular closer J.J. Putz, who blew consecutive saves last week, was out with a stiff back, manager Kirk Gibson said, so David Hernandez came on in the ninth. He gave up a two-out double to Shane Victorino, then Adrian Gonzalez struck out looking, staring at home plate umpire Dan Iassogna after the pitch.	Kennedy got big defensive plays from third baseman Chris Johnson and second baseman Aaron Hill. Johnson nabbed Kershaw's sharp line drive in the sixth and Hill made a lunging grab on Andre Ethier's liner leading off the seventh.	Kennedy, a 21-game winner a year ago, left after giving up a single to Luis Cruz. Brad Ziegler came on and got a double-play grounder to end the inning. Ziegler has induced major league-best 17 double plays, most by a National League reliever since Jeremy Affeldt's 18 in 2009.	Goldschmidt reached for the third time when Ramirez's throw on a deep ground ball bounced in front of first base and Gonzalez couldn't handle it. Montero followed with the double to deep right-center that easily scored Goldschmidt, who had been picked off at first by Kershaw in the second.	Montero advanced to third on a passed ball and tried to score on Johnson's fly ball to center. But Matt Kemp's throw arrived first and Montero was out on a close play, ending the inning.	The Diamondbacks loaded the bases in the third when John McDonald singled with one out, then Adam Eaton and Hill drew two-out walks. The threat ended when Kubel bounced out.	The Dodgers got a runner to second when Ethier doubled to left-center with two outs in the fifth. On the next pitch, Cruz launched one to deep left but Kubel, backtracking in a hurry, made a leaping grab at the wall to rob him of what would have been a two-run homer, and the game remained scoreless.	"I wasn't sure if it was going to get out or not, but thankfully it hung up a little bit so I could get under it," Kubel said. "It was fun. I'm just happy it worked out, and thankfully it saved us a couple of runs. It could have been 2-1, who knows?"	Kemp doubled with two outs in the seventh but was stranded after Ramirez's check-swing dribbler to the pitcher.	Game notes	 Arizona had last won at home on Aug. 22, when it swept a doubleheader from Miami. ... Kershaw leads the NL with 206 strikeouts. ... Los Angeles starts Aaron Harang (9-8, 3.75 ERA) in the finale of the brief series while Arizona goes with Trevor Cahill (10-11, 3.98). ... Goldschmidt's single in the fourth was his first hit against Kershaw in 10 at-bats. ... Arizona improved to 11-6 against the Dodgers this season with one game remaining.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Jerry Blevins has been near the back of the Oakland bullpen for most of his six seasons with the Athletics, rarely shining and sometimes struggling.	Given an unlikely chance to bail out closer Grant Balfour in a key rivalry game, the left-hander succeeded against the odds -- just as his A's have been doing all season long.	Blevins got Howie Kendrick to ground into a game-ending double play with two runners on in the ninth inning, and the A's held off the Los Angeles Angels 6-5 Tuesday night for their fifth straight victory.	"So far, it's the best moment of my career, and the most exciting," Blevins said. "It even trumps my debut."	Torii Hunter and Albert Pujols had run-scoring singles in the ninth for the Angels, who had runners at the corners and nobody out before Blevins relieved Balfour.	Blevins earned his first save since 2010 -- and just the second of his career -- in dramatic fashion, preserving the A's 11th straight road victory when Kendrick hit a fastball straight at third baseman Josh Donaldson.	His only disappointment? No teammates put a shaving-cream pie in his face during his postgame interview.	"(Balfour) has picked us up all year," Blevins said. "He's been rock-steady, and it's good to give him a little payback."	Balfour walked Chris Iannetta and Mike Trout to open the ninth, and said he felt squeezed by home plate umpire Paul Schrieber. Hunter cut Oakland's lead to two runs with a single to center before Pujols drove a single to left, forcing manager Bob Melvin to make a move.	"With none out right there? I don't think it could be much tougher," said Balfour, who watched Blevins' work from the top step of the dugout. "That's about as hard as it gets, and he did it perfectly."	Blevins, who had just one save in his first 204 career appearances, struck out Kendrys Morales with a nasty changeup. Kendrick then grounded to third, and Oakland smartly turned the double play to end it.	"I put a good swing on the fastball, and it just happened to be right at the third baseman," said Kendrick, who went 0-for-5. "It happens sometimes. We had an opportunity to win the game, and it just didn't happen. But you want to be that guy up there to get that big hit."	Brandon Moss and Yoenis Cespedes homered and Dan Straily pitched into the seventh inning of his fourth major league start for the A's. Oakland matched the second-longest road winning streak in franchise history.	Coco Crisp hit a ninth-inning RBI triple and scored what turned out to be the winning run on Hunter's error in right field for the A's, who have taken two straight at Angel Stadium with a rookie starter on the mound.	Straily (2-0) yielded seven hits and struck out eight in his first start since coming up from Triple-A Sacramento last week to take the rotation spot of injured right-hander Brandon McCarthy. He also atoned for a disappointing start against the Angels last month when he gave up five runs and couldn't get out of the fifth inning.	"I just wasn't going to be embarrassed against these guys again," Straily said. "In (the clubhouse), we were kind of going nuts when the double play happened. There were a lot of fist-pumps."	Oakland (81-60) has won 14 of 17 and 20 of 25, moving 21 games over .500 for the first time since the end of the 2006 season. The Athletics' grasp on a wild-card spot gets stronger with each game in Anaheim, and they're just three games behind Texas for the AL West lead.	The A's hadn't won 11 straight road games since 1981. They'll attempt to match the franchise record of 12 straight road wins Wednesday night when A.J. Griffin pitches against Los Angeles' Ervin Santana.	Vernon Wells hit an early two-run homer and Hunter chased Straily with a seventh-inning shot for the Angels, whose wild-card hopes took another hit. Los Angeles had won six straight and 11 of 12 before flopping twice against the A's, who were swept by the Angels in a three-game series last week.	"This one definitely stings a little more, because we had opportunities and didn't get the job done with runners on scoring position and less than two outs," said Hunter, who connected for his 14th homer in the seventh. "But I guess you've got to commend the pitching staff over there for getting the job done."	Trout had three hits for Los Angeles (77-65), which dropped 2½ games behind Baltimore and the Yankees (79-62) for the second wild-card spot with its first back-to-back losses since Aug. 25-26. Tampa Bay (77-64) also is between the Angels and that wild-card slot.	Jerome Williams (6-8) couldn't make it out of the fourth inning in his first start for Los Angeles since July 19. The veteran gave up four runs and five hits, including four straight during Oakland's three-run fourth.	NOTES: Williams hadn't pitched since Sept. 2. ... Trout added another spectacular catch to his large collection, diving forward to snag Cespedes' liner off the turf to end the fifth inning. ... Angels reliever Jordan Walden struck out the side in the eighth.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

SAN DIEGO -- Another day, another loss, and more frustration for the St. Louis Cardinals.	Unlike last year when a tremendous stretch run lifted St. Louis to the NL wild-card berth and, ultimately, the World Series title, the Cardinals are sinking fast.	Clayton Richard pitched seven strong innings and rookie Yasmani Grandal singled home the go-ahead run as the San Diego Padres handed slumping St. Louis its 11th loss in 15 games, 3-2 on Wednesday.	The Cardinals began the day with a one-game lead over Los Angeles for the second NL wild card. The Dodgers, who played later at Arizona, host St. Louis in a crucial four-game series starting Thursday night.	"We can't depend on the other teams to keep losing," Cardinals pitcher Kyle Lohse said. "We have to take care of our own business. We have a big series coming up."	But the Cardinals need to find answers in a hurry. They have lost eight of their last nine road games and are in the midst of playing 13 of 16 away from home.	"We're going through a rough stretch, but at the same time, we're still in the hunt," said right fielder Matt Carpenter, who homered but hurt his club with a key error.	Carpenter's misplay on Cameron Maybin's double in the fifth allowed an unearned run to score.	"I was trying to be aggressive and trying to get around where I could keep him from getting a double," Carpenter said. "The ball just got past me and I turned one bad play into another one by missing the cutoff."	"It's unacceptable," he added. "Those are the kind of things that cost you games. It just wasn't a good play."	Carpenter came back and hit a two-run homer off Richard (13-12) in the sixth to tie the game at 2.	St. Louis put a runner on third with one out in the ninth but was unable to score. World Series MVP David Freese and pinch-hitter Skip Schumaker both grounded out.	Last season, St. Louis went 23-9 down the stretch to capture the wild-card slot. But this team has played the complete opposite in the final weeks.	"Overall, it doesn't matter (how hard the team plays) because it all comes down to whether you win," Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said. "They are still aware of the sense of urgency."	Logan Forsythe hit a solo home run for the Padres, who completed a three-game sweep of St. Louis for the first time since August 1995.	"I take it personally as a compliment to our players that we're able to do that," manager Bud Black said.	San Diego has an NL-best 17-5 record since Aug. 19 and has taken 21 of its last 27 games at home.	"It's exciting when we are winning and playing good baseball like we are," Richard said.	Richard (13-12) outpitched Lohse and gave up only three hits. The left-hander struck out five, walked one and hit a batter with a pitch.	Luke Gregerson pitched the ninth for his seventh save, working around a leadoff double by Allen Craig. After pinch runner Adron Chambers was sacrificed to third, Gregerson got Freese on a grounder to third before walking pinch hitter Carlos Beltran. Gregerson then retired Schumaker on an easy grounder to first base to end the game.	Lohse (14-3) had his eight-game winning streak snapped as he allowed three runs -- two earned -- on five hits over six innings. He struck out eight.	"He was sharp right from the beginning," Matheny said. "These are the ones we have to take advantage of."	Lohse's streak spanned 13 starts back to June 26.	Forsythe connected with two outs in the second to give San Diego a 1-0 lead. In his last 13 games, Forsythe has 11 RBIs and 11 runs while raising his batting average 29 points to .289.	Yonder Alonso singled in the fifth and went to third on Maybin's one-out double into the right-field corner. But when Carpenter overran the ball, Alonso scored.	Carpenter homered immediately after Jon Jay's leadoff single in the sixth, but San Diego went ahead in the bottom half on Chase Headley's two-out double and Grandal's run-scoring single.	Game notes	 Beltran is in a 3-for-26 slump with one extra-base hit in his last 61 at-bats. ... Padres LF Carlos Quentin, who left Monday night's game with a sore right knee, was held out of the lineup for the second straight game. ... Matheny said LHP Jaime Garcia is still set to pitch Saturday night at Dodger Stadium despite a 2-6 record with an ERA of 6.19 in nine road starts. ... St. Louis opens a four-game series at Los Angeles on Thursday night with RHP Lance Lynn (14-7, 4.04 ERA) facing Dodgers RHP Josh Beckett (1-2, 3.86). ... San Diego is off Thursday before hosting Colorado for three games, starting Friday night with Rockies RHP Tyler Chatwood (4-4, 5.32) opposing Padres RHP Andrew Cashner (3-3, 3.46).	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

BALTIMORE --  It was just more than a month ago when the Baltimore Orioles summoned 20-year-old Manny Machado from the minor leagues and thrust him into the middle of a pennant race.	The kid hasn't felt the pressure yet. To the contrary, Machado is hitting in the clutch, playing third base as if he's done it all his life and making heady decisions that leave opponents shaking their heads.	Machado made a brilliant defensive play in the top of the ninth and scored the winning run in the bottom half, and the Orioles beat the Tampa Bay Rays 3-2 on Wednesday night to retain a share of first place in the AL East.	Nate McLouth drove in the decisive run for the Orioles, who moved 18 games over .500 (80-62) for the first time since the end of the 1997 season. Baltimore remained tied atop the division with the New York Yankees, who won 5-4 at Boston.	In the Tampa Bay ninth, pinch-runner Rich Thompson was on second with two outs when Evan Longoria topped a pitch from Jim Johnson (2-1) down the third-base line. Machado picked it up and faked a throw to first as Thompson rounded third. Machado flipped the ball to shortstop J.J. Hardy at third base, starting a rundown that ended with Thompson being tagged out by catcher Matt Wieters.	"I was trying to get Evan out to be honest, but then when I came up I saw I had no chance," Machado said. "So I did a pump-fake and tried to deke the runner. It was just natural. I just came out and didn't think about it."	What made the play even more impressive is that Machado is a converted shortstop. He was moved to third base because the Orioles have Hardy at shortstop.	"He was smart. I don't know if he would have been able to throw out Evan," Hardy said. "I know (Longoria) is running a little slow with his hamstring, but for Manny to do what he did, it just shows you how aware he is at 20 years old. I think he's really impressed me."	Those in the opposite dugout felt the same way.	"His poise and his calmness, he's not taken in by the moment at all," Tampa Bay manager Joe Maddon said. "That was an example of his calmness right there. He's really aware of everything that's going on around him. For him to do that in that situation is impressive. He has the maturity of a veteran."	Added Thompson: "I was prepared for him to go to first, wasn't prepared for Hardy to be backing up. It certainly is one of those plays you will never forget. Certainly never happened to me before."	The Orioles will seek to complete a three-game sweep of Tampa Bay on Thursday.	B.J. Upton homered for the Rays, who fell three games behind the Orioles. Tampa Bay stranded 11 and went 2 for 10 with runners in scoring position.	"We have to get some offense somewhere," Maddon said. "Our defense has gotten better. Our pitching is outstanding, The offense kind of comes and goes. That's the bad part. Our inability to get the hit when we need it."	Machado led off the ninth with a single off Kyle Farnsworth (1-5), took second on a bunt and scored when McLouth hit a liner off the right-field wall. McLouth has assumed the leadoff role in place of Nick Markakis, who broke his left thumb on Saturday.	Orioles starter Miguel Gonzalez allowed two runs, six hits and five walks in six innings. He yielded a leadoff home run for the third time this season, but finished by retiring Jose Molina with the bases loaded with score 2-all.	Tampa Bay right-hander Alex Cobb gave up two runs and seven hits in 4 2/3 innings. He's 5-0 with three no-decisions in his last eight starts.	Cobb was followed by Jake McGee, who struck out all four batters he faced in his 17th straight scoreless appearance.	Upton hit the second pitch of the game into the left-field seats, his eighth career leadoff homer and third this year.	In the bottom half, after RBI singles by Wieters and Wilson Betemit gave Baltimore a 2-1 lead, Cobb struck out Mark Reynolds with one out and runners on second and third. A walk loaded the bases for Machado, who hit into a fielder's choice.	Through the first two innings, Baltimore was 2 for 8 with runners in scoring position.	Ben Francisco tied it for Tampa Bay with a two-out RBI double in the third. Carlos Pena then hit a routine fly ball with two runners in scoring position.	The Rays threatened in the sixth. A single, a walk and a balk put runners at second and third with one out before Gonzalez struck out Ryan Roberts. An intentional walk loaded the bases for Molina, and the crowd of 26,076 stood in anticipation when the count reached 1-2. Molina fouled off a pitch before hitting a grounder to first.	Game notes	 Tampa Bay OF Desmond Jennings (lower back tightness) was available to play but did not start after missing the previous three games. ... Rookie LHP Wei-Yin Chen (12-9) starts for the Orioles on Thursday afternoon. The Rays will start Jeremy Hellickson (8-10), who's winless since Aug. 20. ... Roberts, who strained his left forearm Tuesday night, started at 2B. ... Reynolds struck out three times. ... Upton reached 30 steals for the fifth straight season.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BOSTON --  Derek Jeter doesn't even want to miss one inning of the New York Yankees' playoff push.	The shortstop pulled up lame after lunging for first base on his double-play groundout to end the eighth inning of New York's 5-4 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Wednesday night. Manager Joe Girardi had to talk him into coming out of the game, but Jeter said he would be back in the lineup when they try to hold on to first place in the AL East again Thursday.	"It's really not a thing," Jeter told reporters, refusing to confirm any details about the injury. "They just said, 'Put ice on it [and] come back tomorrow.'"	A day after Jacoby Ellsbury's game-ending single dropped New York into a tie with the Baltimore Orioles atop the division, the Yankees got all their runs on homers to remain there. Curtis Granderson hit two home runs and Robinson Cano also homered for the Yankees.	The Orioles beat Tampa Bay 3-2 on Wednesday night, preserving the tie and dropping the Rays three games back in the division.	"It's playoff baseball," Girardi said. "You're playing in the playoffs right now. That's the way it is for us."	Jeter had two hits to raise his batting average to .325, which is third in the AL. With one out and runners on first and third in the eighth, he hit a grounder to second base and ran down the first-base line to try to beat the relay throw from the shortstop.	Stretching for the base -- too late to beat the throw -- Jeter began limping on his left leg as he continued down the first-base line into right field. Girardi and trainer Steve Donohue rushed out to help him and Jeter tried to wave them off, but the manager overruled him.	"I said, 'We're going to sit you out,'" Girardi told reporters, adding that Jeter had aggravated a previous injury. "It's not that serious. It's something we have to be aware of. But hopefully he's OK."	Girardi described the injury as a bone bruise, but Jeter called it a sprained ankle before becoming even more vague.	"Lower leg," he said.	David Phelps (4-4) gave up one run on five hits and a walk in 5 2/3 innings, striking out five. Rafael Soriano got four outs for his 37th save, but not before allowing a homer to Jarrod Saltalamacchia to lead off the ninth, followed by a fly ball that left fielder Chris Dickerson caught at the base of the Green Monster.	Mauro Gomez grounded out meekly to second base for the second out, then Soriano misplayed Mike Aviles' chopper to extend the game. But Ellsbury followed with another chopper and Soriano gloved it, throwing to first for the final out.	"He hit the ball good. It just wound up in [Soriano's] glove," said Red Sox manager Bobby Valentine, who was ejected for arguing a called third strike to Cody Ross in the eighth and wasn't around to see the team lose for the 12th time in 14 games.	Saltalamacchia had a double, a triple, a homer and a walk for Boston. Aaron Cook (3-10) allowed three runs on seven hits while striking out two in five-plus innings.	The matchup of longtime division foes lacked much of the intensity that had characterized their rivalry the past decade, gaining life only at the end after Valentine was ejected -- along with Ross and third-base coach Jerry Royster. The game was officially announced as a sellout, the 787th in a row at Fenway Park, but there were thousands of no-shows and many of those who did attend were Yankees fans.	They saw Granderson lead off the fourth inning with a homer and, after Alex Rodriguez singled, Cano followed with his career-high 30th home run to make it 3-0. Granderson homered again in the seventh inning after Jeter singled to make it 5-1.	In all, the Yankees have hit 34 homers in 14 games against the Red Sox this season.	The Red Sox made it 5-3 in the bottom of the seventh after back-to-back doubles by Saltalamacchia and Daniel Nava left runners on second and third. One run scored on Gomez's groundout and another came in on Aviles' pinch-hit RBI double.	Game notes	 Jeter scored his 1,860th run, passing Mel Ott for 12th on the career list.  Casey McGehee replaced Jeter at shortstop.  Red Sox broadcaster Joe Castiglione was honored for 30 years with the team in a pregame ceremony.  The Red Sox activated RHP Scott Atchison (right elbow strain) from the 60-day disabled list and transferred LHP Franklin Morales (left shoulder inflammation) to the 60-day DL.  Phelps had not won in four starts since Aug. 13. It's just the third time in nine starts that he has retired more than 15 batters.  Cook has won just once in 12 starts since June.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

TORONTO -- Even catcher Miguel Olivo didn't know that Kevin Millwood was pitching with a sore shoulder.	Olivo hit a solo home run, Millwood won consecutive starts for the first time since May and the Seattle Mariners beat the Toronto Blue Jays 3-2 on Wednesday night.	Millwood, who allowed two runs and two hits, left after five innings with stiffness in his shoulder.	"It's not the way you want to be when you're out there," the veteran right-hander said. "I felt like, for the most part, I could still throw the ball where I wanted to, there was just really nothing on it."	Olivo had no idea his batterymate was hurting until the final out of the fifth.	"He looked fine to me," Olivo said. "I hope he's going to be OK for his next start."	Mariners manager Eric Wedge, who praised Millwood for being "a warrior," said it was too soon to say whether Millwood might need to skip a start.	"Too early to really talk about it," Wedge said. "We'll see how he feels when he comes in here the next couple of days."	Millwood set down the first 10 Toronto batters and retired his final five, but Wedge wasn't about to push him any further once he'd done enough to earn the win.	"He gritted through that last inning but I just didn't feel right pushing him back out there," the manager said.	How did Millwood explain his success in the face of pain and stiffness?	"I threw it pretty much where I wanted to, the ball was moving pretty good," he said. "I guess they weren't expecting 85, 86 (mph)."	Millwood (6-12), who entered 1-6 in nine career starts at Toronto, won back-to-back starts for the first time since winning three straight from May 13-23. The right-hander, who walked one and struck out three, has won just three of 19 starts since.	Edwin Encarnacion touched up Millwood for his 39th homer, a two-run drive into the second deck, but it wasn't enough to keep Ricky Romero from losing his 13th straight decision. The Blue Jays managed only two hits against five Mariners pitchers, with Seattle's bullpen working four hitless innings.	Shawn Kelley and Josh Kinney each worked 1 1/3 innings for Seattle, and Oliver Perez got one out. Tom Wilhelmsen earned his 26th save in 29 chances.	"Those aren't easy save opportunities we're seeing him get," Wedge said. "He's done a great job for us."	Romero (8-14) allowed three runs and eight hits in four-plus innings. Pitching on nine days' rest after giving up seven runs in one-plus inning against Tampa Bay on Sept. 2, the left-hander was unable to make the most of the extra down time. He remained winless since June 22 at Miami.	Romero struck out three and walked four, boosting his AL-leading total to 94, and matched Tom Underwood's team record of 13 straight defeats set in 1978 and 1979.	"It's frustrating," he said. "I'm sure everyone in this clubhouse wants to see me get out of it."	Olivo got the Mariners on the board with a drive to left in the second, his 10th. Mike Carp and Trayvon Robinson followed with singles, but Romero struck out Brendan Ryan and got Dustin Ackley to fly out.	Seattle put runners at second and third with two outs in the third, but center fielder Colby Rasmus caught Olivo's sinking liner to end the threat.	Romero wasn't so fortunate in the fourth. Ryan drew a two-out walk, moved to third on Ackley's double and both runners scored when Franklin Gutierrez singled to right, with Ackley evading catcher J.P. Arencibia's tag at the plate.	Pitching coach Bruce Walton came to the mound after Romero issued a four-pitch walk to Jesus Montero to begin the fifth. When Michael Saunders followed with a ground single to right, manager John Farrell came out and replaced Romero with former Mariners reliever Steve Delabar. Romero did not make eye contact with his manager as he handed off the ball and walked back to the dugout.	"They had me against the ropes a few times and I was able to get out of those jams," Romero said. "It didn't play out like I wanted it to."	Farrell insisted Romero will start again when his turn comes up next, Tuesday at New York.	"We're not abandoning Ricky Romero," Farrell said. "We're going to continue to work with him, we're going to continue to finish this year on a positive note and that is our intent going forward."	Millwood was perfect until Rasmus drew a one-out walk in the fourth. Encarnacion followed with a booming home run to left.	One out later, Adam Lind grounded a single to right, the final hit of the night for the Blue Jays.	Game notes	 Romero leads the AL in earned runs allowed (109) and his ERA of 5.87 is highest among qualified AL pitchers. ... Olivo is the sixth Mariners hitter with at least 10 home runs, the first time since 2007 Seattle has achieved that. ... The Blue Jays are 11-23 in one-run games. ... Toronto's Adeiny Hechavarria made his first career start at 2B, while Anthony Gose started in left field for the first time. ...

CINCINNATI --  Cincinnati played small ball better than Pittsburgh on Wednesday night, allowing the Reds to take another big step toward a division championship.	Homer Bailey pitched seven solid innings and Cincinnati came up with just enough offense to squeeze out a 2-1 win for a three-game sweep of the Pirates.	"I felt like it was a battle all night," Bailey said.	The Reds (87-57) scored both of their runs on outs while moving 30 games over .500 for the first time since they were 96-66 on Oct. 3, 1999. They widened their lead in the NL Central over second-place St. Louis to 11½ games.	Manager Dusty Baker doesn't want to stop there.	"This was our fifth try at 30," he said. "We finally reached it. Now let's set the next goal for 35."	Cincinnati's win and the Cardinals' 3-2 loss at San Diego cut to eight the Reds' magic number for clinching the division. Any combination of Reds wins and Cardinals losses adding up to eight clinches the title for Cincinnati.	Bailey (11-9) allowed six hits and one run with two walks and four strikeouts to extend his career high in victories.	Sam LeCure pitched a perfect eighth and rookie J.J. Hoover allowed a two-out hit before striking out pinch hitter Jose Tabata to complete his first career save.	"It was awesome," said Hoover, one of the relievers filling in as closer while Aroldis Chapman deals with a tired shoulder. "It was a good adrenaline rush."	Hoover is a Pittsburgh-area native, but he didn't attach any extra significance to reaching the milestone against his hometown team.	"It was fun, but I didn't look at it like that," he said.	Pittsburgh starter A.J. Burnett suffered his first loss in four decisions against the Reds this season, two in games started by Bailey. Burnett (15-7), 0-3 in five starts since beating Los Angeles on Aug. 16, allowed five hits and two runs with two walks and eight strikeouts.	"It was a well-pitched game on Homer's side," Burnett said. "You have to tip your hat."	The score was tied 1-all when Ryan Ludwick led off Cincinnati's sixth with a double down the left-field line. He tagged and went to third on Jay Bruce's fly ball to deep center field then tagged and scored on Scott Rolen's sacrifice fly down the left-field line.	The Reds cashed in a bit of good fortune to take a 1-0 lead in the third inning. Ryan Hanigan led off with a lined single to center field and moved to second one out later on Brandon Phillips' bouncer up the middle. Both runners moved up on Burnett's wild pitch, and Hanigan scored on Wilson Valdez's chopper to second.	Baker was impressed with some execution from his team that he wasn't seeing earlier in the season.	"You've got to do those things if you're going to win close ballgames," he said. "(The Pirates) were doing it earlier this season. It's nice to get the sweep and get one step closer."	The Pirates tied it in the fourth on singles by Andrew McCutchen, Garrett Jones and Gaby Sanchez to lead off the inning before leaving the bases loaded when Bailey struck out Burnett.	They missed another scoring opportunity in the sixth when Alex Presley tripled down the right-field line with one out and was caught stealing home when Clint Barmes couldn't get his bat on a suicide squeeze attempt. Baker and bench coach Chris Speier smelled it and ordered a pitchout, which also turned into a disaster when Bailey's foot slipped on the mound and the high-and-away pitch suddenly was low-and-away, but Ryan Hanigan still caught it in time to block the plate.	"All the credit goes to Dusty and Speier," Bailey said. "Hanigan did a great job. He ended up with chalk and dirt all over his face."	Barmes did what he could to get his bat on the pitch.	"It looked like it may have been way outside," he said. "I still almost got a piece of it."	Those are the kinds of plays that haven't gone the Pirates' way during their now season-worst six-game losing streak, which has left manager Clint Hurdle willing to look anywhere for a spark	"We tried to scratch out a run," Hurdle said. "It was a good call by them."	Game notes	 3B Pedro Alvarez was scratched from Pittsburgh's original starting lineup less than an hour before the first pitch with what a spokesman called "right wrist discomfort." There was no definitive word before the game on when Alvarez suffered the injury or how long he might be out. ... 2B Neil Walker took batting practice Tuesday, but he still missed his 15th straight game with lower back tightness on Wednesday. He had no baseball-related activities planned for Wednesday or Thursday, manager Clint Hurdle said. "We'll see how he is on Friday," Hurdle said. ...

NEW YORK --  John Lannan knows he can't pitch like Stephen Strasburg. What he can do is compete like the Washington Nationals' ace.	Lannan pitched five-hit ball over 5 2/3 innings in his first start since replacing Strasburg in Washington's starting rotation, and the Nationals lowered their magic number for clinching a playoff berth to six with a 2-0 win over the punchless New York Mets on Wednesday night.	"It's definitely strange. There's a lot of strange things going on," Lannan said. "What's going on with Stras, it just hasn't happened before."	Ryan Zimmerman homered in the fourth off rookie Matt Harvey (3-5) and Ian Desmond connected off Jon Rauch in the eighth, helping the NL East leaders complete a three-game sweep and open an 8 1/2-game lead over the second-place Braves heading into a three-game series at Atlanta starting Friday. The Nationals are closing in on the capital's first postseason baseball berth since the original Washington Senators in 1933.	"This was a big series," manager Davey Johnson said. "We need to kind of drive the nail in their coffin over here and come into Atlanta in a good frame of mind."	A native of nearby Long Beach, Lannan (3-0) struck out two and walked one in an 81-pitch outing. Lannan, Washington's opening-day starter in 2009 and 2010, was 9-11 with a 4.30 ERA at Triple-A Syracuse and asked the Nationals to trade him when he was demoted at the end of spring training.	"It all happened for a reason, I guess," he said. "I just don't look back on it with anger or anything. It just is what it is. It happened, and we've just got to move on."	Pitching before about 20 family members and friends, he made his first appearance since a minor league outing on Aug. 30 and improved to 4-1 with a 1.69 ERA against the Mets in his last five starts. Without Strasburg's dominant fastball, the left-handed Lannan relies on changing speeds and control.	"He earned a lot of respect in this clubhouse," said reliever Sean Burnett, who gave up two hits and got two outs in the ninth -- his first appearance since Sept. 2 following a layoff caused by an irritated nerve in his pitching elbow.	Drew Storen came in and retired pinch-hitter Daniel Murphy on a game-ending flyout with runners at the corners for his second save. The surging Nationals have won nine of 11 and 12 of 15.	Harvey struck out 10 in five-plus innings, his latest impressive performance. New York, however, finished an 0-6 homestand and dropped to 65-78, falling 13 games under .500 for the first time since finishing 2009 at 70-92. The Mets have lost eight of nine overall.	They also extended their club-record streak of scoring three runs or fewer to 13 straight home games. They have lost 22 of their last 26 in Queens and have just four wins at Citi Field since the All-Star break -- two fewer than the Nationals.	"It's frustrating for all 35 guys in that clubhouse, besides the players, and the coaches and the front office," Mets manager Terry Collins said. "We set the bar pretty high in April and May. Our club wasn't picked to be very good and we set the bar up there.	"Right now, we just cannot seem to recreate what happened in April."	Washington cut short Strasburg's season last weekend, wanting to protect the 24-year-old right-hander's arm following ligament-replacement surgery on Sept. 3, 2010.	While the Nationals initially intended to make Wednesday's game his final start of the year, they moved up their timetable because they said the limit was weighing on his mind. Strasburg finished 15-6 with a 3.16 ERA in 28 starts with 197 strikeouts in 159 1/3 innings.	Johnson said he might use Strasburg as a pinch-hitter down the stretch. Strasburg is hitting .277 with one homer, four doubles and seven RBIs.	"If I can't use your arm, I'll use your bat," Johnson said. "He's pretty bad now but he's going to get worse because he's going to be chomping."	Johnson said Strasburg keeps asking pitching coach Steve McCatty about what his routine should be.	"Of course, he's been pestering Cat about what he can do," Johnson added. "Can I keep throwing off the mound? No. Can I play catch in the outfield? Yes."	Game notes	 Washington has won eight in a row in Queens and 12 of 13. ... Nationals LF Michael Morse missed the game after he was diagnosed with a torn cuff and a bone bruise in his left wrist. ... Players' association head Michael Weiner, undergoing treatment for a brain tumor, was in the Mets' clubhouse speaking with players before the game. ... Zimmerman extended his hitting streak to 16 games and set a franchise record by driving in a run for the ninth straight game, one more than Larry Walker (1993), Moises Alou ('93 and `94) and Vladimir Guerrero ('98). Zimmerman also made several sparkling plays with his glove at third.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Josh Hamilton and Adrian Beltre didn't need to play the entire game to make their mark Wednesday night.	The Texas Rangers will now wait and see if their top two sluggers will be sidelined.	Hamilton and Beltre homered before each left the game with injuries, and Texas beat the slumping Cleveland Indians 5-2.	Hamilton left in the eighth with left knee soreness and Beltre exited in the fifth with a strained left shoulder. Beltre had an MRI on Wednesday night and the results won't be known until Thursday. Texas manager Ron Washington said taking Hamilton out of the game was precautionary and he didn't consider the injury serious.	"Hopefully, things won't last long with those guys," Washington said. "But we certainly can't stop the season, so we're going to play with what we've got and we're going to expect to win."	Beltre injured his shoulder when he made a diving stop of Russ Canzler's grounder in the second.	Mike Olt, who replaced Beltre at third, left the game in the bottom of the seventh with plantar fasciitis in his right foot. Olt, who will have an MRI on Thursday, was limping just before he reached first beating out an infield single.	Ian Kinsler moved to third base for the first time in his career in the top of the eighth, and Jurickson Profar took over for Kinsler at second base.	"Hopefully, it's just precautionary," Kinsler said of his teammates' injuries.	Beltre hit a two-run homer in the first, his 13th in his last 20 games, and Hamilton added a solo shot in the third to help Ryan Dempster win his fifth straight start.	Dempster (11-6) improved to 6-1 since he was acquired by the Rangers on July 31. The right-hander allowed two runs and struck out eight in seven innings.	"I just try to do my job the same way, try to execute and make as many pitches as possible," Dempster said.	Carlos Santana and Casey Kotchman each had an RBI for Cleveland, which led the AL Central on June 23 but is 15-43 since the All-Star break.	Cleveland starter Jeanmar Gomez (5-8) allowed five runs and six hits in four innings. Gomez, who won his prior two starts against Texas this season, has not pitched more than six innings in his last nine starts.	"[Gomez] didn't have good stuff and couldn't locate his pitches," Cleveland manager Manny Acta said. "They took advantage of it."	Joe Nathan, who has converted his last 31 save opportunities, pitched the ninth for his 33rd save of the season.	Texas started the day three games ahead of Oakland in the AL West. The A's played the Los Angeles Angels in a game late Wednesday.	Kinsler led off the bottom of the first with a double and scored on Hamilton's groundout to set the stage for a surging Beltre. Beltre hit a 1-0 pitch from Gomez over the fence in left to give the Rangers a 3-0 lead. It was his seventh home run in September.	Hamilton's 434-foot blast landed several rows deep in the upper deck in right field. He leads the majors with 41 home runs and 121 RBIs.	That was plenty of support for Dempster, who retired the last nine batters he faced. Dempster has a 1.91 ERA over his past five starts. His eight strikeouts were his most since joining the Rangers.	Game notes	 Texas RHP Roy Oswalt (right forearm strain) said he plans to throw on Thursday. He left his start early Sunday against Tampa Bay.  Indians SS Asdrubal Cabrera (sore right wrist) took batting practice Wednesday, but missed his third straight game.  Cleveland RHP Roberto Hernandez (right ankle) is out of his walking boot and is expected to throw a bullpen session early next week.  Texas' Mike Adams said he felt tightness in a muscle near his right shoulder Tuesday night and the reliever likely won't pitch the next two to three days.  Cleveland's Travis Hafner (back) is expected to take batting practice on Friday.  Texas opens the 2013 season at Houston, which will be playing its first season in the AL West.  Texas C Mike Napoli (strained left quad) hit a two-run homer and caught the entire game in a rehab assignment for Double-A Frisco.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

HOUSTON --  Travis Wood has bounced back from eight straight losses to win his past two. Now he wants to keep that going the rest of the season.	Alfonso Soriano finished a triple shy of the cycle and drove in two runs and Travis Wood allowed one run in 7 2/3 innings to lead the Chicago Cubs to a 5-1 win over the Houston Astros Wednesday night.	Dave Sappelt also had three hits for the Cubs, who have won five of the past six games.	"The ball is coming out good," Wood said. "I have been able to locate pitches. I just want to finish the season strong and show that I can handle a full season."	Wood (6-11) gave up four hits and struck out six. Wood has allowed only one run in his past two starts, spanning 13 2/3 innings.	Wood, who didn't allow a base runner until Justin Maxwell's single to lead off the fifth, said his backdoor cutter was working against the Astros and he was able to keep Houston off balance.	Manager Dale Sveum said Wood, who was acquired in the offseason by Chicago, pitched "a heck of a game."	"When we got him, we knew he had some arm strength and arm speed and could do some things," Sveum said. "Obviously, a lot of that one-way pitching was getting him in trouble. Now, he has learned to pitch to his arm side."	Fernando Abad (0-4) gave up a run on four hits in 3 1/3 innings with two strikeouts and three walks.	In his four starts this season, Abad has not lasted longer than 4 1/3 innings. Houston manager Tony DeFrancesco said he had seen enough of Abad.	"We're trying to win a ballgame, and we want to win as many as we can," DeFrancesco said. "If Abad was throwing strikes early, he might have had a chance of getting out of it, but at that point, I felt it was time to move on."	In a scary moment, Houston reliever Mickey Storey left the game with a contusion to his right hand and the right side of his jaw after being hit in the side of face by a Sappelt line drive in the top of the eighth inning. Sappelt's liner appeared to have glanced off Storey's right shoulder before hitting him in his jaw.	Storey fell to a knee and grabbed his jaw area as Astros personnel rushed to check on him. He was down for several minutes before walking into the Astros dugout with the help of Houston trainers.	"The best thing I can take from this is that it didn't hit somewhere worse," Storey said. "Initially, it was shock and hurt, but I think I'll be all right. Hopefully, I'll be back out there soon."	Sappelt, who played against Storey in Triple A, said he felt bad and hoped Storey was all right.	"When I hit it, I didn't think he would be able to get out of the way," Seppelt said. "As soon as he let the ball go, it was coming right at him. I didn't know whether to run to him at the mound or to first. I was in one of those 'I don't know what to do' moments."	Welington Castillo gave the Cubs a 1-0 lead in the first with a two-out single.	Soriano hit his 29th home run of the year off Chuckie Fick in the fifth and extended the lead to 3-0 in the seventh with an RBI single off Fernando Rodriguez down the left-field line.	Anthony Recker upped Chicago's lead to 4-0 in the eighth with a double to the right-field gap off Jose Valdez.	Houston cut the lead to 4-1 in the eighth on a run-scoring single by Fernando Martinez off Shawn Camp, scoring Brandon Barnes, who had chased Wood with a two-out double. Jose Altuve then reached on a single and Jed Lowrie walked to load the bases, but Camp struck out J.D. Martinez to end the threat.	Chicago made it 5-1 in the ninth as pinch runner Tony Campana stole third and scored on Chris Snyder's high throw.	Game notes	 Chicago IF Anthony Rizzo is expected back Friday, Sveum said before Wednesday's game. "He just had a little soreness on his upper right side, but he took some swings in the cage today and he's fine," Sveum said. Rizzo collided with Astros 1B Brett Wallace during Tuesday's game. ... Actor/comedian Cheech Marin threw out the first pitch before Wednesday's game. ... Houston starts a four-game series against Philadelphia Thursday with Lucas Harrell taking the mound against Tyler Cloyd for the Phillies. ... Chicago is off Thursday before opening a four-game series against Pittsburgh at home with Chris Rusin starting against the Pirates' James McDonald.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

CHICAGO --  Max Scherzer was eager to get on the mound Wednesday night. The way he sees it, there's nothing better than having the chance to pitch and help his team make the playoffs.	Detroit's hard-throwing right-hander allowed four hits and a run in six strong innings and the Tigers beat the Chicago White Sox 8-6 to move within a game of the AL Central lead.	"I love being in this situation. This is where I want to be," Scherzer said. "I want to have all the marbles on the line in a pennant race, where these games mean everything. I love having the ball in this situation."	Scherzer (16-6) set a career high for wins, struck out seven to increase his major league-leading total to 220 and improved to 10-1 over his past 14 starts. The only run he allowed was on the first of two homers by Kevin Youkilis.	With Detroit leading 3-1, Prince Fielder hit a three-run homer in the seventh and the Tigers held off a late Chicago rally to beat the White Sox for the ninth time in the past 10 games.	"It's really big. If we just focus on trying to play good baseball, it should work out," Fielder said. "It feels like every time we score, they score and vice versa, but that's what happens. Anytime you have two good teams, you know it's not gonna be easy. Fortunate for us, we were able to beat them in the final round."	After dropping the opener of the key four-game set on Monday, the Tigers have won two in a row in their last head-to-head meeting with the AL Central leaders.	"I knew coming in we had to win these games. This was going to be the biggest start of the season for me, and I wanted to go out and give the team a chance to win," Scherzer said.	Thursday night's series finale features a pair of aces, with reigning AL MVP Justin Verlander taking on White Sox left-hander Chris Sale in a rematch of a Sept. 2 game that Verlander won with an eight-inning, 11-strikeout effort.	"We're going to have to win games after tomorrow, too," Chicago manager Robin Ventura said. "We're going to face good pitchers just like him (Verlander). ... Scherzer pitched great, there was nothing going on there. You just continue to play. We're not quitting at any point. That's the one great thing about the team, they're not going to get down where they're giving up."	Fielder hit his 26th homer in the seventh against lefty reliever Leyson Septimo, snapping a 0-for-18 slump and giving Detroit a 6-1 lead. The drive to right followed two-out singles by Andy Dirks and Miguel Cabrera.	Even though another White Sox lefty, Donnie Veal had, retired Fielder twice during the series, Septimo got the call this time. Ventura said he wanted to give Fielder a different look than what he would get from Veal.	"I knew a lefty was coming, they're all the same. It's a lefty, they're all tough," Fielder said.	"We had done a really good job of getting Prince out for the first 2 1/2 games, and he hung a slider and Prince didn't miss it," Chicago catcher A.J. Pierzynski said. "That's what good hitters do and that's why he gets paid also."	The Tigers added two more runs in the eighth on RBI doubles by Alex Avila and Austin Jackson.	Youkilis belted a three-run shot off Joaquin Benoit in the eighth to get the White Sox within three runs. Youkilis has 18 homers, 14 of them since he was acquired in a trade with Boston in late June. He entered the game in a 3-for-34 slump.	Jose Valverde allowed two hits and a run in the ninth on Alexei Ramirez's grounder before getting Orlando Hudson on a called third strike for his 30th save in 34 chances.	Chicago starter Gavin Floyd (9-10), activated from the disabled list (elbow strain) earlier in the day, pitched well for the first four innings but gave up three runs in the fifth.	Brennan Boesch, who had been 0-for-18 in his career against Floyd, opened the fifth with a single and Jhonny Peralta walked. Avila sacrificed, Omar Infante drove in a run with a grounder and Jackson delivered an RBI single to put the Tigers up 2-1 and finish Floyd.	Hector Santiago came in and walked Dirks before giving up an RBI single to Cabrera.	Floyd threw 70 pitches in his first start since Aug. 26. He gave up four hits and was charged with three runs to go with a walk and seven strikeouts.	Game notes	 Floyd fell to 7-3 lifetime against the Tigers. ... White Sox DH Adam Dunn sat out his sixth straight game with a right oblique strain.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

MILWAUKEE --  Left for dead in the playoff race a month ago, the Milwaukee Brewers inched closer to a wild-card spot after sweeping the Atlanta Braves, a scenario that had backup first baseman Travis Ishikawa searching to explain the team's recent surge.	Ishikawa, subbing for the injured Corey Hart, blasted a bases-clearing double in Milwaukee's eight-run fifth inning, coming after a three-run home run by Rickie Weeks earlier in the frame, and the Brewers beat the Braves 8-2 on Wednesday night.	"I felt like we had dug a hole pretty deep that we weren't going to be able to get out of," Ishikawa said. "That just shows you the character of this team. As far out as we've been and as bad as we played earlier this year, we just found a way to play the ball we knew we were capable of playing. We've got a little ways to go, but it's definitely going to be a fun few weeks."	The victory was the Brewers' ninth in a row at Miller Park and 18th in the past 23 games. Milwaukee (72-71) climbed above .500 for the first time since it was 4-3 on April 12.	The Brewers moved within three games of St. Louis for the second NL wild card. Despite the loss, the Braves continue to have a strong hold on the top wild card position.	Brewers starter Yovani Gallardo also connected for a run-scoring double in the game-turning inning, during which the Brewers sent 13 batters to the plate while collecting eight hits and two walks. Milwaukee trailed 2-0 entering the frame.	Gallardo (15-8) pitched seven strong innings in his majors-leading 24th quality start of the season. He gave up two runs on only four hits while walking three and striking out six.	Relievers Jose Veras and Kameron Loe combined to shut out the Braves over the final two innings.	"It's pretty exciting in here right now, for all of us," Gallardo said. "We've just got to keep it up. That's a tough team on the other side and being able to win all three games is huge."	Brewers manager Ron Roenicke credited Gallardo for overcoming early control issues.	"At the beginning the command was a little off. Then he gets it going again and starts getting in a rhythm," Roenicke said. "He threw some great curveballs today."	Atlanta starter Paul Maholm (12-10) held the Brewers scoreless through four innings before running into major trouble in the fifth.	Maholm gave up nine hits and eight runs -- six earned -- in 4 1/3 innings. He walked two batters and struck out a pair. Maholm entered the game 0-2 with an 11.25 ERA in two prior starts against the Brewers this season.	"I can't say I like this place. I'm kind of glad to be out of here and not coming back this year. They've got a good lineup. Obviously, they know me and I know them," Maholm said.	Roenicke struggled to explain the Brewers' success this season against Maholm.	"We didn't do much until that (fifth) inning. Why we didn't do anything and all of a sudden we bust out, I don't really know," he said.	Weeks connected for his 18th home run of the season to spark the fifth-inning outburst, giving the Brewers a 3-2 lead. Weeks, who began the season in a horrendous slump, has been on an torrid streak at the plate.	"He's been good for a long time now and this stretch has been really good and at a time when we really need him," Roenicke said.	Following Weeks' blast, Milwaukee added five more runs in the inning, three on a double by Ishikawa.	"Corey's been doing a tremendous job over there. He's definitely a guy you can't replace," Ishikawa said. "I'm doing everything I can in my own capabilities to hold my own over there and just pray that he gets back healthy and quickly."	Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez thought the Braves were poised for a victory after the team jumped out to a quick 2-0.	"Early in the game, we made some great defensive plays. Guys were bouncing everywhere and got a couple of quick runs and I thought, `OK, here we go," Gonzalez said. "But it's hard to win ballgames when we score three runs in three games and we give up a bunch."	The Brewers are having success in all phases of the game, which has allowed the team to climb into the playoff hunt, he added.	"In the second half of the season, they're one of the hottest teams in the National League. They're playing good, they're pitching good, putting the ball in play when they have to," Gonzalez said.	Jason Heyward got the Braves on the board in the first inning when he hit a two-out, solo home run. The Braves added a run in the fourth.	Game notes	 Brewers CF Carlos Gomez left the game in the second inning with a lower quad contusion. He's day-to-day, according to team officials. .The Brewers presented Chipper Jones with a Weber gas grill and a year's supply of Klement's sausages in an on-field ceremony prior to the game to mark the retirement of the Braves' third baseman. Jones, who played his 42nd and final game against the Brewers on Wednesday, announced earlier this year his plan to retire at the end of his 18th full season in the majors, all of them with Atlanta. Jones got a loud standing ovation and tipped his cap to the crowd in his final at-bat in the ninth inning. ... Brewers 1B Hart took batting practice but sat out Wednesday's game as he continues to struggle with plantar fasciitis in his left foot. Team officials said Hart, who hasn't played since Sunday, is questionable for the team's next game on Friday at home.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

MINNEAPOLIS --  The Kansas City Royals seem as though they've been a team on the rise for years, with each crop of hot young prospects supposedly the group that is going to drag the franchise up from the depths of the AL Central.	Billy Butler is hoping this latest batch of fresh faces finally will help them finish the job.	Butler had three hits and three RBIs, and the Kansas City Royals' bullpen picked up struggling starter Luke Hochevar with four scoreless innings in a 10-5 victory over the Minnesota Twins on Wednesday night.	"I just think it's good for our young guys to get confidence. I think every year I've been here we've had good Septembers, but we got a good August and September," Butler said. "Outside of a 12-game losing streak earlier in the season we've played really good baseball. ... We've been really consistent after that, and it's something we can build on in the offseason and it might make us ready sooner."	Salvador Perez homered and drove in two runs for the Royals, who sent 10 batters to the plate in their five-run fifth and another nine in a four-run eighth.	The Royals went 17-11 in August and have won four of their past five games to improve to 6-6 in September. But they remain a few front-of-the-rotation arms away from being a legitimate threat.	Hochevar was supposed to be one of those guys, but he continues to underwhelm. He got behind 1-0 in the first on Wednesday night after a leadoff triple from Span, walked three straight batters in the third, including Doumit with the bases loaded, and gave up two more runs after the Royals handed him a 6-3 lead in the fifth.	"He hasn't won a game in his last seven starts and I wanted to get him over that hump," manager Ned Yost said. "He was working hard out there, maybe a little too hard. He was trying with everything that he had to get over that hump, too. I was bound and determined to give him every opportunity to do it."	Hochevar (8-13) won for the first time since July 31, but he gave up five runs on six hits with four walks and four strikeouts in five innings. Tim Collins pitched two innings before Kevin Herrera and Francisley Bueno finished the game.	"Of course that wears on you," Hochevar said of his skid. "Regardless of that, I'm going to go out and fight for every pitch, I'm going to go out and compete to the best of my ability. Tonight, our offense picked me up."	P.J. Walters (2-4) gave up six runs on seven hits in four innings and Twins left fielder Ryan Doumit was charged with three errors in the eighth to help the Royals put the game out of reach.	Joe Mauer missed his second straight game because of back spasms for the Twins.	Doumit, who has primarily served as the backup catcher to Mauer, has been working his way into left field more often recently to try to keep his bat in the lineup. The acclimation turned ugly in the eighth when he dropped a fly ball from Johnny Giavotella after a long run to the gap, then booted a hard-hit single by Alcides Escobar that allowed a run to score. Doumit's throw also allowed two runners to advance, giving him a third error in the inning.	It was the second time this season, and fourth since 2010, that a player has committed three errors in one inning, according to STATS LLC. Oakland first baseman Brandon Moss did it in the sixth against San Francisco on June 23.	"It's part of the learning curve," Doumit said. "It's part of all that. It's embarrassing, but I'm going to learn from it and go out and get 'em tomorrow."	Game notes	 Perez has a 16-game hitting streak, tied with A.J. Pierzynski for the longest by a catcher this season. ... Carroll has a career-high 10-game hitting streak. ... Twins RHP Cole De Vries will have an MRI exam on his sore ribs Thursday. His scheduled start has been tentatively pushed back from Friday to Sunday, pending the outcome of the test. ... The temperature at first pitch Tuesday night was 93 degrees. A day later, it was 58. ... RHP Liam Hendriks (0-7, 6.20 ERA) will pitch the series finale for the Twins against RHP Luis Mendoza (7-9, 4.63). Hendriks is still looking for his first big league win. He carries an 0-9 career record into the start. Mendoza served up three homers to the White Sox in his last start.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

DENVER --  No question, Tim Lincecum is getting better. Especially away from San Francisco.	Lincecum pitched effectively for six innings to extend his road winning streak to a career-best five straight, Brandon Crawford doubled twice and drove in two runs, and the San Francisco Giants beat the Colorado Rockies 8-3 on Wednesday night, opening a seven-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers atop the NL West.	Marco Scutaro added three hits, including a pair of run-scoring singles, to help the NL West-leading Giants take two of three from the Rockies and improve to 21-7 on the road since the All-Star break, best in the NL. They are unbeaten in their past nine series on the road (8-0-1).	Lincecum (9-14), who allowed three runs on six hits, has figured prominently in that run of success, going 5-0 with a 2.61 ERA in his past five road starts. The two-time NL Cy Young award winner had struggled on the road earlier, going 1-6 with a 9.00 ERA through his first 10 starts away from home.	"Right now I'm not pitching great, but I am getting out of jams," said Lincecum, who finished with four walks and eight strikeouts, punching out the final batter he faced, Dexter Fowler, on three pitches to end a one-on, two-out threat in the sixth.	"I'm playing with a fine line there, walking a lot of guys, but getting out of it gives me the confidence to know that if I get into a jam, I can get out of it and my team is going to get me out of it, too."	San Francisco manager Bruce Bochy said Lincecum has been coming on strong, along with the rest of the team.	"He has really elevated his game," Bochy said. "He's gotten on track, which is huge for us. Some of the other guys have had some hiccups and he has picked us up."	Jeff Francis (5-5) couldn't recover from a tough first inning and took the loss, allowing five runs on seven hits in three innings. He struck out five and walked none.	"A few bad pitches and they came out ready to swing," Francis said. "It wasn't anything about me not feeling good or not trying to be aggressive. I made some mistakes, they hit them. That turns it into a long inning."	Down 6-2 in the sixth after Crawford doubled for the second time and scored on Scutaro's second single, the Rockies added a run in their half of the sixth on Charlie Blackmon's pinch-hit RBI double.	But the Giants added a pair of runs in the ninth on a run-scoring triple by Hunter Pence and Joaquin Arias' sacrifice fly.	"That's what we've been doing," Crawford said of a Giants offense that had each starter except the pitcher get at least one hit. "Pretty much 1-through-9 has been coming through for us, and that's what we did again tonight.	"I think we're a confident group right now whether it's at home or on the road. It's definitely good that we feel comfortable on the road and we're getting those wins and hopefully we can keep it going."	The Giants had grabbed a 5-0 lead by batting around in the first inning. Gregor Blanco tripled off Francis to start the game and scored when Scutaro followed with a single. Buster Posey and Arias each singled around Pence's fielder's choice to account for another run and Hector Sanchez hit an RBI single ahead of Crawford's two-out, two-run double that rolled to the right-field wall.	Colorado pulled to 5-2 behind Wilin Rosario's RBI single in the first and his solo homer in the third. Rosario drove Lincecum's 83-mph changeup deep into the left-field bleachers for his team-leading 24th homer, one shy of the Rockies' rookie record set by Todd Helton (25) in 1998.	Game notes	 The Giants last lost a series on the road July 6-8 when they dropped two of three in Pittsburgh.  Giants CF Angel Pagan was held out of the starting lineup after a callous on his left hand cracked, causing a cut. He made an appearance as a pinch hitter in the eighth and finished the game in center.  The Giants have an off day Thursday.  RHP Matt Cain (13-5) is slated to start Friday night's game at Arizona against the Diamondbacks' Tyler Skaggs (1-1).  Since July 1, Crawford is hitting .441 (15-for-34) against left-handed pitching.  Slumping Giants 3B Pablo Sandoval was given the night off.  The Rockies also have Thursday off, their final off day of the season.  Penny Chenery, a resident of nearby Boulder who owned and bred 1973 Triple Crown winner Secretariat, attended the game.  With his 24th homer, Rosario tied Troy Tulowitzki for second-most homers by a Rockies' rookie in team history.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

PHOENIX --  Facing division-rival Los Angeles for the fourth time in two months, Diamondbacks starter Trevor Cahill reached deep into his bag of tricks.	Cahill got through a rocky first inning before mixing four pitches to retire 20 of his final 22 batters, and the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the slumping Los Angeles Dodgers 3-2 on Wednesday night.	"I felt confident I could throw all four pitches anytime in the count," said Cahill, who has won his past four starts against Los Angeles. "If you only have two pitches working and they know it and I know it, you end up trying to throw too fine a pitch."	Justin Upton and Gerardo Parra hit consecutive RBI singles to support Cahill's seven strong innings.	The Dodgers, who have lost six of seven, squandered a chance to pull even with the St. Louis Cardinals in the race for the second NL wild-card spot. The Cardinals lost 3-2 to San Diego earlier Wednesday.	The defeat left Los Angeles a game behind St. Louis. The teams begin a four-game series Thursday at Dodger Stadium.	"I'm sure people are getting tired of hearing me say it, but we have to turn the page," Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said. "St. Louis and ourselves, we have let a lot of people back in the race -- but it's still in our hands. No matter how bad it has looked and no matter where it has been, it's still right there for us."	Arizona (71-72) moved within four games of the Cardinals.	"It's getting better," Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson said. "We need to keep running in the same direction we're going now, but it's getting interesting."	Cahill (11-11) scattered four hits, struck out seven and did not walk a batter for the second time this season. He also did not issue a free pass June 20 against Seattle.	"He kept it together," Gibson said. "He limited the damage, and that was big."	Los Angeles took a 2-0 lead in the first when Shane Victorino singled, Cahill hit Matt Kemp with a pitch and Adrian Gonzalez hit a two-run double to right-center.	After that, Luis Cruz's two singles represented all the offense for the Dodgers over the final eight innings.	"It feels good that you're able to score two early," Mattingly said. "But that feeling goes away as you're not able to add on. As the game gets later, you've given the momentum back."	Pitching with a 2-1 lead, Dodgers starter Aaron Harang issued consecutive two-out walks in the sixth. Upton followed with a single to tie the game 2-all and end Harang's night.	Left-hander Randy Choate came on to face the left-handed-hitting Parra, who lined a single to right that gave the Diamondbacks a 3-2 lead.	"You get two guys who are up there that can change a game real quick, so you're not trying to lay a cookie in there," Harang said. "You're trying to give them something to swing at that they're either going to hit softly or hit on the ground somewhere. Then I end up walking those guys."	Harang (9-9) allowed four hits in 5 2/3 innings but walked four.	David Hernandez pitched the ninth for his second save in two nights, retiring Kemp, Gonzalez and Hanley Ramirez in order.	"As closer, that's who you want to face," Hernandez said. "They're not all going to be three-run saves."	Gonzalez, punched out on a called third strike for his third strikeout of the game, thought it was ball four.	Los Angeles, which dropped seven games behind first-place San Francisco in the NL West, is batting .184 in its past five games with one homer and seven runs.	The Diamondbacks have won 10 of the past 12 meetings between the clubs. Arizona starters are 9-0 with a 1.75 ERA in their past 12 games against the Dodgers.	"Winning one-run games against division rivals, sometimes those are better than blowouts," Cahill said.	The Diamondbacks cut Los Angeles' lead in half in the second when Paul Goldschmidt singled, stole second, went to third on a wild pitch and scored on a sacrifice fly by Upton.	Game notes	 Hernandez last recorded back-to-back saves on July 7-8, 2011. ... Arizona has won consecutive one-run games for the first time since opening the season with three straight one-run victories over the Giants. ... Diamondbacks closer J.J. Putz missed his second straight game with stiffness in his back. ... Harang is 3-8 with a 3.19 ERA in 17 career appearances and 16 starts against Arizona. ... What better way to reduce some pennant-race tension than phantom infield practice? Before the game, the Dodgers pantomimed their way through their infield warm-up, with the fielders scooping imaginary grounders and catchers stumbling in foul territory under invisible, sky-high popups. ... Dodgers RHP Josh Beckett (1-2) starts against St. Louis RHP Lance Lynn (14-7) on Thursday. The Diamondbacks have the day off before rookie LHP Tyler Skaggs (1-1) faces RHP Matt Cain (13-5) to begin a three-game series against San Francisco.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  A.J. Griffin threw eight scoreless innings, becoming the second Athletics pitcher in 85 years to start his major league career with six straight wins, and Yoenis Cespedes homered for Oakland in a 4-1 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Wednesday night.	The Athletics, who can sweep the four-game series by beating Angels ace Jered Weaver on Thursday, have won 15 of 18 and are 22 games over .500 (82-60) for the first time since the 2006 club finished 93-69.	The A's won their 12th consecutive road game, matching the 1971 squad for the longest streak since the club relocated from Kansas City to Oakland in 1968. The franchise record is 14 in a row, set in May 1931.	Oakland's road winning streak is the longest in the majors since 2003, when Seattle won 13 straight away from Safeco Field.	Griffin struck out six and walked none in the longest of his 11 career starts. The 24-year-old right-hander, one of four rookies in the A's rotation along with Jarrod Parker, Dan Straily and Tommy Milone, lowered his ERA to 1.94 in his third start off the disabled list.	The only other A's pitcher since 1927 to win his first six decisions as a big leaguer was Jim Nash, who was 7-0 over his first nine starts in 1966.	Sean Doolittle gave up a leadoff homer in the ninth by Albert Pujols before Ryan Cook got the final out for his 14th save. Pujols, a three-time NL MVP, became the first player in history with 30 homers in each of his first 12 big league seasons. He also tied Stan Musial and Willie Stargell for 28th place on the career list with No. 475.	Ervin Santana (8-12) was charged with two runs -- one earned -- and four hits over six innings. He struck out six.	It was the eighth time this season that his teammates didn't score a run while he was in the game -- including five straight starts by Santana in which the Angels were shut out.	The Angels got a scare in the fourth when Santana was struck on the right arm by a line drive off Josh Donaldson's bat. He scrambled after the ball in time to get the force at second base on Brandon Moss, then was allowed to take a few practice pitches to test his arm after manager Mike Scioscia and trainer Adam Nevala went out to check on him.	Oakland got an unearned run in the first when Josh Reddick doubled with two outs and scored on an error by shortstop Erick Aybar.	Cespedes made it 2-0 with his 18th homer leading off the sixth, ending a career-worst 22-game homerless drought. The A's tacked on two runs in the eighth with Derek Norris' RBI double and an RBI single by Coco Crisp.	The Angels ran themselves into an out in the third, when Chris Iannetta tried to advance from first to third on Mike Trout's single to center and Crisp made a perfect, one-hop throw to Donaldson.	Game notes	 Santana has given up a major league-worst 35 homers, the most in his eight-year career. ... Rookie pitchers have 40 of the A's victories, four shy of the Oakland record set in 2009. ... A's starters have walked three batters or fewer in 41 consecutive games, tying the Oakland record set in 2001. ... The Angels haven't been swept in a four-game set by Oakland since the final series of the 2001 season, when they finished the schedule with a 2-19 thud. ... Pujols, relegated to DH duty the past 15 games because of a sore right calf, is hitting .317 with two homers and 10 RBIs during that stretch. ... Santana has not allowed a seventh-inning run in any of the past 32 starts in which he's pitched through the seventh. The streak began on Sept. 11, 2010. ... Aybar's error was his 13th, matching last season's total when he won his first Gold Glove.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

BALTIMORE --  The Baltimore Orioles have too much else going on to be overly excited about ending their miserable run of 14 consecutive losing seasons.	Manny Machado blooped an RBI single that eluded left fielder Matt Joyce's desperate dive with two outs in the 14th inning, and Baltimore beat Tampa Bay 3-2 Thursday to complete a three-game sweep and remain atop the AL East.	With their 81st victory -- and 13th in a row in extra innings -- the Orioles are assured no worse than a .500 record for the first time since 1997.	"There's a bigger goal in mind," manager Buck Showalter said. "That wasn't the goal from Day One this spring. Really, Day One of the offseason. It's watching other teams for years and saying, 'We want to do what they're doing.' We'd like to get a chair at the dance, you know?"	It's been an incredible season for the Orioles, who finished in the cellar in each of the previous four years. Baltimore (81-62) remained in a first-place tie with the New York Yankees, who beat Boston on Thursday night, 2-0.	After briefly celebrating a victory that capped a 5-2 homestand against the Yankees and Rays, the Orioles packed in the clubhouse for a trip to Oakland.	"It makes that West Coast trip a little easier when you win," said closer Jim Johnson, part of a bullpen that kept Tampa Bay scoreless on four hits over the final 6 2/3 innings. "You can enjoy it for a little bit, the five hours you're on the flight, but that's about it."	The Rays fell four games back in the division by virtue of yet another one-run defeat punctuated by a lack of offensive punch. Tampa has lost 13 of its last 16 one-run games, including a 3-2 decision Wednesday night.	"It's just the same old story: We can't score enough runs," manager Joe Maddon said. "We pitched extremely well, we played well in the field overall, loved the effort."	But the Rays stranded 10 and went 1 for 7 with runners with scoring position. Tampa Bay left Camden Yards for Yankee Stadium to play a three-game series that begins Friday night.	Sixteen pitchers took part in the game, which lasted 5 hours, 14 minutes. Tampa Bay used a club-record 26 players, including nine pitchers.	After the Orioles squandered a bases-loaded, no-out threat in the 13th, Chris Archer (0-3) got the first two outs in the 14th before Adam Jones walked and Endy Chavez singled. Machado followed with a soft liner toward the line that Joyce trapped.	"I know it hit my glove on the bottom," Joyce said. "It was hard to tell what exactly happened. Only thing I can tell you is I didn't come up with it."	Machado, a 20-year-old rookie, scored the game-winning run in the bottom of the ninth Wednesday night.	"I'm having a blast," Machado said. "This team is great to be around. It's a great group of guys. We're all excited. We're all having one goal, which is make the playoffs."	The Orioles' success in extras this season matches the longest in the majors since Cleveland won 13 straight extra-inning games in 1995.	Randy Wolf (2-0) earned the win by striking out Joyce with two on in the top of the 14th. Baltimore has won 14 of 19 overall and is 26-11 since Aug. 3.	Although the Orioles blew a 2-1 lead in the eighth inning, they improved to 64-0 when leading after the seventh.	Baltimore loaded the bases with no outs in the 13th but could not score after the Rays employed five infielders in hopes of cutting off the potential winning run at the plate. Robert Andino hit into a force at home, pinch-hitter Matt Wieters struck out and Nate McLouth struck out.	"We came up short that inning," Machado said, "but we won it in the next."	Orioles rookie Wei-Yin Chen gave up two runs and eight hits in 7 1/3 innings. Working with a 2-1 lead in the eighth, Chen walked leadoff hitter Desmond Jennings, who advanced on a passed ball and a stolen base before scoring on a slow roller to third by Ben Zobrist for a hit.	In the bottom half, the Orioles got runners on the corners with one out before Joel Peralta struck out Machado and Mark Reynolds.	Limited to four hits through the first six innings, Baltimore went ahead with a two-run seventh. After Rays reliever Wade Davis mishandled a bunt by Machado, Andino walked and seldom-used backup catcher Taylor Teagarden hit a two-run double into the gap in right-center.	Tampa Bay starter Jeremy Hellickson allowed four hits and three walks in five-plus innings. He was pulled after J.J. Hardy led off the sixth with a single.	Jake McGee, who struck out all four batters he faced on Wednesday night, came in and struck out pinch-hitter Lew Ford, Jones and Chris Davis. It was McGee's 18th consecutive scoreless appearance since July 18.	To that point, the game's only run came in the fourth inning. Singles by Zobrist and Evan Longoria put runners at the corners before Jeff Keppinger hit a sinking liner to center. Jones made a fine diving catch, and Zobrist tagged up from third and scored.	Game notes	 An MRI on Baltimore RHP Jason Hammel showed no new damage to his right knee, and he hopes to return soon. "It's probably the best situation we could  have," he said. ... Jennings returned to the Tampa Bay lineup after missing four games with back tightness. ... Tampa Bay 2B Ryan Roberts fouled a ball off his left ankle in the 11th and left the game. X-rays were negative. ... David Price (17-5, 2.54 ERA) will start Friday night for Tampa Bay against CC Sabathia (13-5, 3.56) . ... Baltimore has held the Rays to 10 runs in the last seven games between the teams. ... Right-hander batters are 9 for 93 (.097) against McGee. ... TB's B.J. Upton went 0 for 6 and was 1 for 14 in the series.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  The Los Angeles Angels received a big lift from Jered Weaver in his timely return to the mound.	Weaver allowed just two hits over seven innings, helping the Angels avoid a four-game sweep by the Oakland Athletics with a 6-0 victory Thursday. Torii Hunter homered and added an RBI single in a six-run seventh.	"Obviously we didn't want to get swept. Things didn't go the way we wanted them to the first three games, but those guys are playing good baseball and you can't take them lightly," Weaver said. "These guys are always scrappy, so it's going to be interesting down the stretch."	Weaver (17-4) struck out nine in his first start since skipping a turn in the rotation because of biceps tendinitis, which was detected in an MRI after he was struck on his pitching arm by a line drive off the bat of Seattle's Dustin Ackley on Sept. 2.	"There was no discomfort at all. I felt free and easy," Weaver said after his 94-pitch effort. "It's usually the (middle of the game) where it starts tightening up, and it's tough to go back out there and warm up again. But I didn't have that issue today. It's definitely comforting, knowing that you came out of the game throwing close to a hundred pitches and still feel good."	The only hits for the A's were a first-inning single by Josh Reddick and a third-inning double by Jemile Weeks after center fielder Mike Trout stumbled while chasing the ball in right-center.	"I was antsy to get out there, no doubt about it," Weaver said. "It was disappointing to miss a start, but luckily it was only one and I was able to get healthy again. It was nice to be able to throw up some zeros. I was just trying to get a feel for the game again and tried to locate. After the first strikeout you kind of feel a little bit more comfortable, and after that it's time to go to work."	The All-Star right-hander has four starts remaining in his attempt to become the fourth 20-game winner in Angels history and first since 2005 -- when Bartolo Colon won 21 and the AL Cy Young Award. Clyde Wright had 20 wins for the 1970 club and Nolan Ryan had 22 in 1974.	The loss snapped Oakland's 12-game road winning streak, two shy of the franchise record set in May 1931. The A's were shut out for the 16 time this season, the most in the majors.	Brett Anderson (4-1) was charged with five runs and nine hits over 6 2/3 innings in his fifth start since returning from Tommy John surgery on July 14, 2011. The left-hander is 2-20 in 33 career starts when getting fewer than three runs of support while he is in the game, as opposed to a 23-4 record when his teammates score three or more before he departs.	"Obviously, you knew it was going to be a tough day, going up against one of the best pitchers in baseball. But you want to go out there and prove yourself and try to match him pitch for pitch," Anderson said after his ERA rose from 0.69 to 1.93. "I was able to do that through six, but I got a little tired in the seventh and fell behind. But for the most part, I was happy with the way I battled and got out of some jams."	Hunter led off the seventh with his 15th homer, driving a 2-0 pitch to right-center for the first home run allowed by Anderson in 27 innings this season.	"Weave pitched a tremendous game, and he was just waiting for us to do something," Hunter said. "The home run came on a two-seam fastball away. I was kind of looking for a pitch out over the plate, but I was able to get extension and drive it. I wasn't thinking about hitting a home run at all. I just wanted to hit it hard, get on base for the guys behind me and get something started."	Erick Aybar doubled one out later and scored on a single by Mark Trumbo. A single by Vernon Wells and a two-out walk to Trout loaded the bases for Alberto Callaspo, who greeted Jesse Chavez with a two-run single. Trout scored his major league-leading 115th run on a passed ball by George Kottaras before Hunter added his run-scoring single.	Hunter, who was 3 for 4 in the cleanup spot with Kendrys Morales getting the day off, is batting .351 since the All-Star break with five homers and 41 RBIs.	"My whole career I've been a strong second-half hitter because I make adjustments. That's what baseball is all about, and that's what I've been able to do it with the Twins and with the Angels," Hunter said. "And because we're close to the playoffs, I think I go to another level and get that different adrenaline flow in the second half. That's what drives me."	Weaver recorded six of his first seven outs on strikeouts. The A's twice got a runner as far as second, but Wells made a sprinting catch of Seth Smith's flyball inside the left field foul line to strand Weeks in the third. Weaver stranded Josh Donaldson in the fifth by striking out Cliff Pennington and retiring Weeks on a flyball.	Game notes	 A's rookie LF Yoenis Cespedes left the game midway through the fifth inning because of a sprained right wrist. ... Weaver has made 98 starts, pitched 661 1/3 innings and faced 2,624 batters since giving up his last intentional walk -- to Kansas City's Mark Teahen on Sept. 4, 2009, at Kaufman Stadium. ... Four more RBIs will make Albert Pujols the 14th Angels player to drive in 100 runs and hit 30 homers in the same season. ... Oakland won the season series 10-9. Pennington had only one RBI in 51 at-bats against the Halos this year, a home run Monday night against Dan Haren. ... Oakland's starters have walked three batters or fewer in 42 consecutive games, tying the Oakland record set in 2001 when Rick Peterson was the pitching coach under manager Art Howe.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

TORONTO --  Felix Hernandez summed up his latest loss in one word: terrible.	Edwin Encarnacion hit his 40th home run, Adam Lind also connected and the Toronto Blue Jays beat the Seattle Mariners 8-3 Thursday night to send Hernandez to his third straight defeat.	"That was terrible right there," a frustrated Hernandez said.	Hernandez (13-8) allowed a season-high seven runs and 10 hits in four innings, struck out four and walked one. He has a 9.00 ERA in his last three outings, losing three consecutive starts for the first time since Sept. 12-24 last year.	"It looked like his stuff was pretty good," Seattle manager Eric Wedge said. "He just didn't have the same location that you normally see him have."	Hernandez matched a season-high by giving up 11 hits to Oakland in his last start, and complained afterward that none of his pitches had been working.	"Today, nothing was working, either," he said after being beaten around by the Blue Jays.	Hernandez is 2-3 since throwing the major leagues' 23rd perfect game against Tampa Bay on Aug. 15.	"I have to do something," he said. "The last three starts have been disappointing."	Encarnacion hit a three-run shot in a five-run fourth inning as the Blue Jays avoided a three-game sweep.	Even Hernandez was impressed after Encarnacion sent a changeup into the second deck in left.	"Oh, man, that was long," Hernandez said. "That's a pretty good one right there. It was a good pitch, it was down."	Encarnacion's shot gave him 102 RBIs, the first time he has topped 100.	"I have eight years playing in the big leagues, I never got to 80," Encarnacion said. "It's not easy to get to 100 RBIs. Not many people make it to 100 RBIs so that's the bigger thing for me."	Lind's homer was a two-run shot to right in the first.	Henderson Alvarez (9-12) allowed three runs in seven innings to beat his childhood idol. Both pitchers were born in Valencia, Venezuela.	"(Hernandez) is the guy that I always follow," Alvarez said through a translator. "I'm always looking forward to see what he's doing so he can accomplish the same thing."	Alvarez, who walked three and struck out two, has won back-to-back starts for the first time since July 22-28.	"He was throwing hard and it looked like his velocity stayed with him throughout the game," Seattle's John Jaso said. "His fastball had good life on it and he kept it going."	Brad Lincoln and Aaron Loup each worked one inning of relief as Toronto avoided a sixth straight defeat to Seattle.	Trailing 2-0 on Lind's homer, the Mariners tied it in the second on Carlos Peguero's two-run double over left fielder Rajai Davis.	Brett Lawrie's two-run single put the Blue Jays ahead in the fourth, Colby Rasmus walked and Encarnacion followed with his homer. He moved one behind Texas slugger Josh Hamilton, who leads the major leagues with 41 homers.	"This is a very good right-handed power hitter," Blue Jays manager John Farrell said of Encarnacion. "He's having one heck of a year for us."	Jeff Mathis hit an RBI single off Carter Capps in the fifth for an 8-2 lead, and Dustin Ackley hit a solo homer off Alvarez in the seventh.	Mathis matched a career high with the third fourth-hit game of his big league career, his second this season.	Game notes	 When Encarnacion's bat shattered on his groundout in the first inning, the barrel flew into the Blue Jays dugout and struck pitching coach Bruce Walton on a forearm. Walton, who sustained a bruise, was taken for precautionary X-rays. "Fortunately he was able to get his arms up in front of his face," Farrell said. "And that's where it was heading: right up into his head." Bullpen coach Pete Walker replaced Walton on Toronto's bench. ... Davis was nearly thrown out after making a big turn around first on his infield single in the third and was later thrown out at third after going too far round the bag on Mathis' bunt single. ... Blue Jays RHP Chad Jenkins is expected to head to Instructional League next week to get work as a starter, allowing him to be stretched out enough for a major league start before the end of the season. ... Seattle INF Carlos Triunfel doubled in the ninth, his first career hit.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

BOSTON --  Derek Jeter didn't let an injury stop him from tying Willie Mays for 10th place on the career hits list or helping the New York Yankees stay tied for the AL East lead.	An aching left ankle limited Jeter to the designated hitter's role on Thursday night. But his RBI single in the seventh inning provided a cushion for Phil Hughes and helped the Yankees win consecutive games for the first time in a month with a 2-0 victory over the Boston Red Sox.	New York kept pace with the Baltimore Orioles, who completed a three-game sweep of the Tampa Bay Rays with a 3-2, 14-inning win earlier Thursday.	Jeter's 3,283rd hit put him alongside Mays.	"It's kind of hard to think about it now because you're trying to win games, especially this time of year," Jeter said, "but I'd be lying to you if I didn't think it was special."	And he did it "on probably about one ankle," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "That's who he is. He's a fighter and he finds a way, and he gets the big hit tonight. It was impressive."	Jeter was 0 for 3, then blooped the single to center field. With 19 games left, he has a chance to move into ninth place on the all-time list this season. He is 30 behind Eddie Collins' 3,313.	The Yankees captain aggravated the ankle in Wednesday night's 5-4 win when he pulled up lame lunging for first base trying to avoid a double-play grounder in the eighth.	"I'm fine," he said. "Everything's good."	Hughes (15-12) retired his first 10 batters and gave up five hits in 7 1/3 innings. He struck out seven, walked one and allowed just three runners past first base, ending a streak of seven straight starts in which he allowed home runs. Hughes has given up two or fewer runs in five of his last six starts.	"Hughes pitched up in the strike zone and we couldn't lay off it," Boston manager Bobby Valentine said. "We were immature in our approach at times."	Rafael Soriano pitched the ninth for his 38th save in 41 chances.	New York, which led the division by 10 games before play on July 19, went 5-5 on a trip to Tampa Bay, Baltimore and Boston.	After winning two in a row for the first time since taking three straight from Texas over Aug. 13-15, the Yankees return home for nine games against the Rays, Toronto and Oakland. They then play three games at Minnesota and four at Toronto before finishing up with a three-game series in the Bronx against Boston.	Knowing that the Orioles already had won, temporarily taking over sole possession of first place, didn't affect the Yankees' approach.	"If it was the last game of the season (it might have)," Jeter said, "but we know we have enough games left to where once again we have to win our games. That's the bottom line. It doesn't really make a difference what they do because we can't control it. All we can do is control how we play and we had a good game tonight."	Boston lost for the 13th time in 15 games, lowering its magic number for AL East elimination to two. The Red Sox fielded a lineup with only five players who started the season in the majors. Dustin Pedroia missed the game to be with his wife, who gave birth to their second child.	"The atmosphere was a little dull in here for the first time in a long time," Hughes said, "just being the way the Red Sox season has gone this year. So, if anything, it felt like a normal game."	Felix Doubront (10-9) gave up two runs and four hits in 6 1/3 innings, dropping to 0-5 with a 7.38 ERA in his last eight starts.	New York loaded the bases with no outs in the fourth on a single by Alex Rodriguez, who stole second, and walks to Robinson Cano and Russell Martin. Andruw Jones hit a sacrifice fly, and Curtis Granderson lined out to first baseman James Loney, who stepped on first for a double play.	"That was big," Doubront said. "Last week that situation came up and I didn't respond. I responded pretty well tonight. I'm happy to limit the damage that inning."	He was chased with one out in the seventh when he walked Steve Pearce and allowed a single to Eduardo Nunez. Junichi Tazawa gave up Jeter's single.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Jason Kipnis and the Cleveland Indians spoiled Joe Nathan's five-month perfect run out of the bullpen.	Kipnis hit a two-run homer in the ninth inning off Nathan and the Indians snapped a five-game losing streak, beating the Texas Rangers 5-4 on Thursday night.	Nathan (2-4) had converted a club-record 31 straight save chances before the Indians erased a 4-2 deficit in the ninth. The right-hander's only other blown save this season came April 11 against Seattle.	"It's special any time you do it," Kipnis said. "You're in the big leagues. Everybody is a big name here."	Ezequiel Carrera homered leading off the ninth. Pinch-hitter Russ Canzler singled to bring up Kipnis.	The Cleveland second baseman lined a 1-0 pitch several rows deep into the seats in right.	After Kipnis' drive, Carlos Santana doubled to chase Nathan without him recording an out.	"I know my location was off," Nathan said of his pitch to Kipnis. "It was supposed to be down and away and I yanked one."	The Rangers remained three games ahead of Oakland in the AL West after the Athletics lost to the Los Angeles Angels.	Scott Maine (1-0) got the final two outs in the eighth in his third appearance with the Indians this season. Chris Perez pitched the ninth for his 36th save in 40 tries, helping Cleveland avoid a three-game sweep.	"It was a great team win," Indians first baseman Matt LaPorta said.	The Rangers scored twice to take a 4-2 lead in the eighth with the help of two errors.	Elvis Andrus reached on shortstop Brent Lillibridge's second throwing error of the game and scored when third baseman Jack Hannahan couldn't handle Nelson Cruz's grounder. Michael Young added an RBI single that gave the Rangers a two-run lead.	The Indians overcame three errors that led to three unearned runs.	"We tried to give it away," Cleveland manager Manny Acta said. "We didn't play very good defense. That was a great comeback against a guy like Joe Nathan."	Texas slugger Josh Hamilton, who leads the majors with 41 home runs and 121 RBIs, missed the game with soreness in his left knee. Rookie Leonys Martin started in Hamilton's place.	Hamilton left Wednesday night in the eighth inning and received an injection after the game. Texas manager Ron Washington said he doesn't think it's a serious injury and Hamilton is expected to be back in the lineup Friday.	Adrian Beltre got two hits as the designated hitter, a day after leaving early with a left shoulder injury. Beltre was not in the original lineup before he convinced Washington that he was healthy enough to play.	LaPorta had three hits, including a two-run homer for the Indians, who are just 16-43 since the All-Star break.	The Indians completed a 10-game road trip with a 4-6 record.	"In the second half we've been struggling," Kipnis said. "To end a road trip with a win in the last game takes a lot of the pressure off. It's better than going back with our shoulders down and wondering why we lost another one."	Cleveland starter Zach McAllister allowed two runs and eight hits in six innings. The right-hander gave up seven runs over five innings in his previous start against the Rangers on Sept. 2.	Texas starter Derek Holland allowed seven hits and two runs. The Ohio native struck out seven and hasn't lost since July 31.	Beltre singled with one out in the fourth, Cruz doubled and Young followed with an RBI single. Cruz scored on Lillibridge's throwing error.	Vinny Rottino singled leading off the sixth and he came home on LaPorta's shot that made it 2-all. It was LaPorta's first home run of the season.	Game notes	 Acta said LHP David Huff will move into the starting rotation. Huff has pitched six scoreless innings in relief since being recalled from Triple-A Columbus on Sept. 4. He will take the place of Jeanmar Gomez, who is 5-8 with a 5.61 ERA. ... The Rangers reached 3 million in home attendance for the first time in club history. The crowd of 36,102 increased their season total to 3,003,143. Texas still has 10 home games remaining. ... Cleveland CF Michael Brantley (sore left pectoral muscle) was scratched from the lineup after taking batting practice, and SS Asdrubal Cabrera did not start for a fourth straight game with a sore right wrist. Cabrera, who entered as a defensive replacement in the ninth, will be examined when the team returns to Cleveland on Friday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

HOUSTON --  Philadelphia's recent surge was slowed by an unlikely foe.	Pinch hitter Jed Lowrie delivered a two-run double in the eighth inning and the lowly Houston Astros stung Philadelphia, rallying for a 6-4 victory Thursday night that ended the Phillies' seven-game winning streak.	That run had pushed the Phillies within three games of St. Louis for the second NL wild-card spot.	"The percentages in baseball, sooner or later you are going to get beat," Philadelphia manager Charlie Manuel said. "At the same time, I didn't mean for it to happen tonight. We had a chance to win the game, it was sitting right in front of us. The bottom line is that we didn't add on runs, but we didn't execute either."	Philadelphia couldn't hold an early 4-0 lead. Lowrie's two-out hit put the Astros ahead 5-4.	"We had opportunities and Lowrie got a big hit for him," Philadelphia's Ryan Howard said.	Matt Dominguez hit a three-run homer for Houston, which has the worst record in the majors.	Philadelphia's bullpen had pitched four scoreless innings after an early exit by starter Tyler Cloyd before running into trouble in the eighth.	Phillippe Aumont (0-1) took over in the eighth with a 4-3 lead and walked Jason Castro with one out. Pinch runner Jordan Schafer was caught stealing on a strong throw by catcher Erik Kratz from his knees.	But Aumont walked Dominguez and plunked pinch hitter Scott Moore on the foot.	Aumont pitched in both games of a doubleheader on Sunday and in each of the last three games.	"That is a lot of pitching for him, and I did feel like he was out of gas," Manuel said. "The more he stayed out there, you could see that he didn't have the stuff he had yesterday."	Jake Diekman, the fifth Phillies reliever of the game, gave up Lowrie's hit that stopped a string of 21 consecutive scoreless innings pitched by Philadelphia's bullpen.	Brandon Barnes pushed the lead to 6-4 with an RBI single.	Wesley Wright (1-2) got the last two outs of the eighth for the win. Wilton Lopez allowed a hit in a scoreless ninth for his fifth save.	For the Astros, it was a bright spot in this mostly dreadful season.	"There's a lot of satisfaction in that," Wright said of beating a team in postseason contention. "They come with a lot on the line and we have a chance to kind of derail that and finish the season on a positive note. So it's a good victory all the way around."	Kratz broke an 0-for-16 skid with an RBI double to give Philadelphia a 1-0 lead in the second.	The Phillies scored three times in the third. Juan Pierre and Chase Utley hit consecutive one-out singles and Howard had a sacrifice fly. John Mayberry Jr. and Kevin Frandsen added RBI singles.	Justin Maxwell and Castro hit consecutive singles in the fourth before Dominguez's shot. The drive broke an 0-for-13 streak for Dominguez and was his third three-run homer in the last seven games.	Houston starter Lucas Harrell allowed seven hits and four runs in 5 2/3 innings to remain winless since Aug. 14.	Pinch hitter Pete Orr singled with two outs in the sixth and Harrell issued consecutive walks to load the bases. Harrell was lifted after the second walk, and jawed at plate umpire Bill Miller on his way to the dugout and was ejected.	"The competitiveness of wanting to win kind of got a hold of me today and I let my emotions run a little bit," Harrell said, adding that he thought he pitched "horrible."	He was replaced by Xavier Cedeno, who retired Utley to end the threat.	Cloyd yielded five hits and three runs in three-plus innings.	Cloyd retired his first six batters before Jimmy Paredes singled to start the third. Jose Altuve hit a two-out single and Cloyd hit Fernando Martinez with a pitch to load the bases before getting Brett Wallace on a grounder.	It was the second tough start for Cloyd, who had his contract purchased from Triple-A Lehigh Valley on Aug. 29. He allowed eight hits and four runs in four innings of his last start, but received a no-decision.	Game notes	 Frandsen was back in the lineup after missing seven starts with a sore left ankle. ... Houston's Bud Norris was scratched from Friday's start because of a blister on the index finger of his pitching hand. The Astros have a six-man rotation, so each pitcher will simply be moved up a game. RHP Edgar Gonzalez will start on Friday against Philadelphia LHP Cole Hamels. ... Astros reliever Mickey Storey was OK a day after being hit on the side of the face by a line drive which glanced off his hand and shoulder before striking him in the face. He said before the game that he's a bit sore but feels lucky that the injury wasn't worse.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Trevor Plouffe hopes a strong finish will solidify his position as the Minnesota Twins third baseman of the future.	Plouffe hit a tying home run in the bottom of the ninth inning, Denard Span had a game-ending RBI double in the 10th and the Twins rallied for a 4-3 victory over the Kansas City Royals on Thursday night.	Alexi Casilla led off the 10th with a double to right-center off Francisley Bueno (1-1) that fell just beyond the glove of diving center fielder Lorenzo Cain, who injured his right hamstring on the play and had to leave the game. He'll be reevaluated tomorrow. Span then hit a double over the head of right fielder Eric Hosmer for the win.	Closer Glen Perkins (3-1) pitched two scoreless innings for the win.	Josh Willingham also connected for Minnesota and Salvador Perez had two RBIs for the Royals.	Plouffe was on a torrid streak at the plate in June, hitting .327 with 11 home runs. He was hitting .302 in July with three home runs before bruising his right thumb July 20 and going on the disabled list. Since his Aug. 13 return, Plouffe is hitting .180 with two home runs and 11 RBIs.	"I felt better today at the plate. I didn't play yesterday, so (hitting coach Joe) Vavra and I worked a lot in the cage just figuring some things out so I felt comfortable. I felt good all day today. ... It's something I've got to build on."	Plouffe also flashed some leather, lunging to his right in the fifth inning to rob Alcides Escobar of an extra-bases hit and then throwing out the shortstop at first.	"He's been working really hard on his defense and on his steps. There's a lot that goes into the game and he's a little flustered," said manager Ron Gardenhire. "It was a really good play, a really aggressive throw."	Plouffe came up as a shortstop, but has since made a switch to the hot corner.	"The angles are way different at third base. You've got to drop-step for a lot of those balls, especially the ones that are hit hard and at shortstop-second base you're taught to come in and get the ball," he said. "I just got to keep working."	After being stymied by Royals starter Luis Mendoza for most of six innings and reliever Aaron Crow for one, Minnesota loaded the bases with two outs in the eighth against reliever Kelvin Herrera before Royals closer Greg Holland entered and walked Willingham to make it 3-2.	"You don't want to lose a game like that," said Kansas City manager Ned Yost. "They beat our best."	Mendoza, who had allowed 13 earned runs in 15 1/3 innings over his past three starts, kept the ball down and allowed two hits while striking out six.	After allowing Willingham's home run and a single to Justin Morneau in the first inning, Mendoza retired 14 of the next 16 Minnesota batters, including four of five by strikeout at one point. The two Twins to reach were by walk.	Minnesota starter Liam Hendriks overcame a rough start to allow seven hits and three earned runs over five innings. He walked two and struck out three.	Hendriks became the fifth player since 1920 to go winless in his first 17 career starts. The record is 20 set by Bill Caudill of the Cubs (1979-81) and Oakland's Mike Mohler (1993-97). Besides his 13 starts this year, Hendriks was 0-2 with four starts for Minnesota in 2011. However, he was 9-3 at Triple-A Rochester this season.	Hendriks gave up a two-run single to Perez as part of a 30-pitch first inning as he struggled to attack the zone and get ahead of hitters, but settled down after that.	Willingham countered with his 34th home run in the bottom of the inning.	David Lough tripled to lead off the Kansas City fifth and scored on a two-out double by Billy Butler to make it 3-1.	The Royals were 2 for 12 with runners in scoring position.	"We could have done more to get a more comfortable lead," said left fielder Alex Gordon. "Our bullpen has been lights out this year, and it's going to happen once in a while."	Game notes	 Butler was ejected in the 10th inning for arguing a called strike. ... Twins All-Star Joe Mauer missed his third straight game due to back spasms. ... Minnesota starting pitcher Cole De Vries is done for the year after an MRI Thursday revealed a cracked rib. The right-hander finishes 5-5 with a 4.11 ERA in his rookie season. ... Minnesota C-OF Ryan Doumit is day to day with a strained muscle in his rib cage. ... Esmerling Vasquez (0-1, 9.35) is scheduled to start Friday for Minnesota when it welcomes Chicago to start a three-game series. The White Sox will send Chris Sale (16-6, 2.88) to the mound. Kansas City returns home to face Los Angeles Friday with Bruce Chen (10-12, 5.36) scheduled to face the Angels C.J. Wilson (12-9, 3.69).	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

LOS ANGELES --  Although Allen Craig's bouncing single didn't look like much, it was just what Lance Lynn and the St. Louis Cardinals needed to get back on track in the wild-card race.	Craig drove in Shane Robinson with the go-ahead run in the seventh inning, and the Cardinals extended their NL wild-card lead over Los Angeles to two games with a 2-1 victory over the struggling Dodgers on Thursday night.	Lynn (15-7) pitched six innings of five-hit ball to earn his first win since July 27 for the Cardinals, striking out seven in the All-Star's stellar return to the rotation after a bullpen demotion. Yet he wasn't rewarded for his effort until Craig's single eluded two Dodgers and squeaked into right field.	"It's definitely a dogfight," said Craig, a Southern California native. "To be part of a close game with a lot of energy and to come out on top is great for our team. ... I thought it had a good chance to get through. I didn't know if I hit it hard enough, but I did."	Skip Schumaker had an early run-scoring single as St. Louis (76-68) snapped its three-game skid and a four-game road losing streak with a nail-biting win over the Dodgers (74-70), who have lost four straight. With Lynn in charge on the mound, the defending World Series champion Cardinals eked out just enough runs to earn their fourth win in 16 games in the opener of a key four-game series.	After getting banished to the bullpen last month, Lynn made the most of his chance to take the turn of injured Jake Westbrook. Lynn won his first six starts this season and was voted to the All-Star game by the players, but plummeted out of favor and made six relief appearances since his previous start Aug. 24.	"That's one of the best starts he's had this season," Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said. "It just says volumes about his makeup and his stuff. It was a tough transition to the bullpen, and some guys handle it better than others. ... He showed he learned some things and couldn't wait to go out there and still prove he was ready to start."	Both teams stumbled into Dodger Stadium hardly resembling the top two contenders to face Atlanta in the NL wild card playoff game. St. Louis and Los Angeles had lost three straight and six of seven, allowing Pittsburgh, Milwaukee, Philadelphia and even Arizona to creep into striking distance in the wild-card race.	"You definitely want to get off to a great start against a team we're playing for a wild-card berth," Lynn said.	Adrian Gonzalez had an RBI double in the Dodgers' seventh loss in eight games, putting a gloom over Dodger Stadium while the Cardinals wrapped it up.	Jason Motte gave up Hanley Ramirez's two-out double in the ninth, but got Shane Victorino on a soft flyball to complete his 34th save.	"The pitchers are doing their job, but we're not scoring runs," said Matt Kemp, who went 1 for 4. "One run is not going to win games in series like this, so we've got to find a way to get the job done. I can't really explain what's going on. You just take one good at-bat at a time and see where it takes you."	Josh Beckett gave up seven hits and a run while pitching into the sixth inning of his fourth start for Los Angeles, while rookie Paco Rodriguez (0-1) and Ronald Belisario allowed the seventh-inning rally capped by Craig's RBI single.	"We've got to stop worrying about what everybody else is doing and go out and win games ourselves," Beckett said. "That's a good ballclub over there, but we've got to figure out some way to win this series. They're the ones that we're chasing."	Beckett struck out six and had decent numbers despite laboring through long stretches of his second home start since the trade. He also didn't endear himself to Dodgers fans by putting a line drive into right field in the third inning and then getting thrown out at first by Carlos Beltran when he didn't hustle to the base.	After rescuing Beckett from a sixth-inning jam, Rodriguez walked Robinson and allowed Matt Carpenter's one-out single in the seventh. Belisario got Matt Holliday on a fly to center, but Craig delivered.	Game notes	Jose Canseco watched the game from a field box wearing a black T-shirt reading: "Sorry For Everything Mark," an apparent reference to Mark McGwire, his former Oakland Athletics teammate and the Cardinals' hitting coach. ... Craig was born in Mission Viejo and graduated from high school in Temecula. ... Rodriguez began this year at the University of Florida, where he made the All-SEC first team. The Dodgers' second-round pick was the first member of the 2012 draft class to make the majors when he debuted in San Francisco last Sunday. ... Beckett hadn't pitched against the Cardinals since 2005. ... Entering the night, Lynn led the NL with 6.60 runs of support per game. ... IndyCar driver Helio Castroneves threw out the first pitch. IndyCar finishes its season this weekend in Fontana.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

CHICAGO --  The Chicago Cubs are becoming quite a problem for the Pittsburgh Pirates.	Pittsburgh lost its seventh straight game Friday and kept fading in the NL wild-card race as Starlin Castro hit a three-run homer that sent Chicago to a 7-4 win.	The Pirates have dropped 11 of 13 overall. They began the day three games behind St. Louis for the final NL playoff spot.	The Cubs have won four straight against the Pirates, including a three-game sweep last weekend in Pittsburgh.	Chris Rusin (1-2) notched his first major league victory, allowing two runs in five-plus innings in his fourth career start.	"It feels good," the 25-year-old Rusin said after a cold beer shower. "I located the ball, kept the ball down and got ahead of a lot of hitters."	The Cubs led 4-3 in the sixth before Castro connected after Luis Valbuena walked and Alfonso Soriano was hit by a pitch.	"I wanted to jump on the first pitch because I knew he would throw me a fastball," Castro said. "I know the team isn't going anywhere, but we have to finish strong."	Since Castro's debut in 2010, he leads all National League players with 508 hits.	"We all know what kind of hitter he is right now," Cubs manager Dale Sveum said. "I was more impressed not by the home run, but by the adjustment he made. He went with no leg kick and no stride and hit a home run."	"Those are the things you look for, to see guys make adjustments. That's when you start to grow as a player."	Andrew McCutchen homered in the Pittsburgh seventh, but Cubs reliever Shawn Camp tossed a perfect eighth and Carlos Marmol earned his 20th save in 22 chances. Marmol has converted 19 consecutive save tries.	Pirates starter James McDonald (12-8) struggled once again in the second half. He lasted just 3 2/3 innings, allowing four runs on five hits and four walks. He is 2-5 in his last 10 starts.	McDonald, who also hit a batter, hurt himself with wildness. He walked three batters in the fourth before Anthony Rizzo delivered a two-run double down the right-field line and Alfonso Soriano hit an RBI single that made it 4-0.	"I didn't have any pitches today, but I've pitched in that situation where I didn't have any pitches before," McDonald said. "Walks are unacceptable. I had two outs, I should have gotten that out and been in the dugout."	The Pirates got an RBI single from Pedro Alvarez in the fifth and closed within a run in the sixth.	Gaby Sanchez singled home a run and Alvarez had an RBI grounder, but Pittsburgh left the bases loaded when James Russell struck out pinch-hitter Neil Walker.	On Aug. 8, the Pirates were 63-47, but have gone 9-24 since. They are now just a game over .500 for the first time since June 15 when they were 32-31. Pittsburgh hasn't finished with a winning record since 1992.	While the Pirates continue to fight for a postseason berth, the Cubs have a magic number of their own. The victory was the Cubs' 57th, meaning six more wins lets them avoid a third 100-loss season.	"We got the magic number down," Sveum said. "These guys have a lot of pride and are trying to stay from that number."	Cubs second baseman Darwin Barney was 2 for 2 with a run scored to extend his hitting streak to a career-high nine games.	Game notes	 Cubs' first-round draft pick Albert Almora took batting practice with the team at Wrigley Field prior to the game. He will report to the instructional league on Monday. ... Alvarez (sore wrist) returned to the lineup after missing Wednesday's game. Walker (lower back tightness) did not start for the 16th consecutive game. ... Jason Berken makes his Cubs debut Saturday against Wandy Rodriguez (10-13, 3.72).	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CLEVELAND --  Justin Verlander's only mistake may have been trying to chest bump Prince Fielder.	"I'm not a little guy," Verlander joked of his encounter with the extra-large Fielder. "But I've seen him take a couple of guys out like it was football."	Verlander survived, and the Tigers didn't lose any ground in the AL Central.	Verlander pitched seven shutout innings, getting huge defensive plays from Fielder and Miguel Cabrera to snuff Cleveland threats, and Detroit stayed within one game of first-place Chicago with a 4-0 win over the downward spiraling Indians on Friday night.	Coming through the way he almost always does, Verlander (14-8) allowed six hits and delivered another dominant performance. But if it wasn't for diving stops by Fielder and Cabrera, big men best known for their powerful bats, the right-hander could have been in trouble.	"Game-saving plays," Tigers manager Jim Leyland said. "Everybody's going to talk about defense, but those guys made terrific plays on the corners."	Detroit jumped to a 4-0 lead after two innings against Corey Kluber (1-4), who managed to hang around for five innings but couldn't overcome two shaky ones.	The Indians, who were within 3 1-2 games of first when they rallied to beat Verlander on July 26, are 10-36 since that win and 16-44 since the All-Star break.	"I don't think anybody's thinking that far back," Indians manager Manny Acta said. "We're trying to keep things present."	Verlander had been scheduled to pitch Thursday in Chicago against White Sox ace Chris Sale. But rain postponed the series finale and marquee pitching matchup, pushing the AL's reigning Cy Young winner back. The one-day delay didn't have much affect on the Tigers' top gun, who on a chilly, October-like night, pitched as if it was the postseason.	Verlander needed some help, though, and got it from the unlikely pair of Fielder and Cabrera, beefy corner infielders who both came up golden with their gloves.	The Indians didn't get a runner to second until the fifth, when Casey Kotchman blooped a leadoff single and went to third on Lonnie Chisenhall's double.	Cleveland was threatening, but Verlander hardly seemed frightened.	He got Matt LaPorta on a weak tapper in front of the plate for the first out, then struck out Ezequiel Carrera, setting him up with a 99 mph fastball for strike two and then locking him up with an 89 mph change-up.	Jason Donald followed with a hard grounder down the first-base line that Fielder stopped with a dive that carried him from the infield dirt onto the grass in foul territory. From his knees, Fielder tossed the ball to Verlander, who raced over to cover first. As Fielder got back to his feet, Verlander gave his 275-pound-plus teammate a congratulatory bump.	"It wasn't hit hard, but those are the balls that can create into chaos because it got right down the line," Fielder said. "I was glad I was able to get it."	In the sixth, the Indians put runners on second and third with one out. Verlander got Russ Canzler to fly out, and Cabrera ended the inning by making a backhanded diving stop on Kotchman's line-hugging smash before bouncing up and throwing to first for the final out.	Verlander raised his right fist in the air and held it there as he waited in the middle of the infield to swat Cabrera on the backside as he ran to the Tigers' dugout.	"That's a huge pickup," Verlander said of the two stops. "When you're out there on the mound and you're battling and one of your teammates makes a play like that, that's teamwork at its best. Obviously, I was pretty pumped up about it."	After winning just once in his past six starts, Verlander came in with a season-high 2.91 ERA. All he needed was an outing against the inept Indians to drop it back down to 2.82.	The defending AL MVP lost his two previous starts to Cleveland this season, including the July 26 game when he gave up four runs in the seventh and lost 5-3. Verlander had also been winless on the road since July 15, going 0-3 with a 6.46 ERA in five outings.	Verlander didn't ease into anything. The right-hander fired several 97 mph fastballs in the first, which he ended by snagging Carlos Santana's comebacker and starting a 1-6-3 double play.	Verlander took the mound with a 2-0 lead after the Tigers strung together four two-out singles off Kluber.	With two outs, Cabrera singled up the middle and Fielder followed with a hard shot to short right that ate up second baseman Jason Kipnis, who was playing deep on an overshift. Delmon Young's single made it 1-0, and Brennan Boesch hit an RBI single.	The Tigers went up 4-0 in the second on Austin Jackson's RBI double and Cabrera's run-scoring single.	Game notes	 Leyland can't return to Progressive Field without thinking about when he managed Florida in the 1997 World Series, when snow fell before Game 3. "I'll never forget it," he said. "I was hitting fungoes during batting practice and they were playing `Jingle Bells." ... Since 2008, Cabrera is batting .338 (113 for 334) with 22 homers and 76 RBIs in 86 games against Cleveland. ... Donald was hit on the right wrist by Verlander in the seventh.

NEW YORK --  Tampa Bay manager Joe Maddon insisted he was going back to his hotel to call his wife and finish an engrossing novel. That game out in Oakland: not on the agenda.	His team had other ideas.	David Price earned his league-leading 18th win with another superb performance against the New York Yankees, and the Rays opened a key series against their AL East rivals Friday night by taking advantage of a fading CC Sabathia and hanging on for a 6-4 victory.	After being swept by the Orioles this week to fall four games back of division co-leaders New York and Baltimore, the Rays let loose -- jumping around and clapping hands, Price said. They also had every TV in the clubhouse turned to the O's and A's, a game won by Oakland, 3-2.	"That was a big game for us, facing CC and that lineup," Price said. "We were up to the task."	Out of the rotation since Sept. 2 because of a sore shoulder, Price (18-5) boosted his AL Cy Young Award credentials with seven innings of two-run ball. Striking out six and giving up five hits, the lanky lefty got a big lift from an inadvertent deflection off an umpire and a fine play by second baseman Elliot Johnson.	Price improved to 7-3 against the Yankees. The Rays have won seven of the eight games he has matched up against Sabathia.	With Price out of the game, Alex Rodriguez hit his 647th homer, a two-run shot off Joel Peralta in the eighth that sent him past Lou Gehrig for ninth place on the runs list with 1,889 and scored Derek Jeter to make it 5-4.	Jeter, serving as the designated hitter for a second straight day because of an injured ankle, singled leading off to wake up the 45,200 fans who were silenced by Tampa Bay's rally against Sabathia (13-6). Jeter had an infield single in the fifth to pass Willie Mays for 10th on the hits list with 3,284.	After a walk to Robinson Cano, closer Fernando Rodney entered. The top reliever by ERA in the majors (0.66) struck out Russell Martin, threw a wild pitch and walked pinch-hitter Raul Ibanez. Curtis Granderson meekly grounded to end the threat and send many to the exits.	Rodney finished with a perfect ninth for his 43rd save in 45 chances.	"We had two Cy Young candidates pitch for us tonight," Maddon said. "Two guys at the top of their game. It was fun to watch."	The Yankees lost for the fourth straight time with their burly ace on the mound, and this one could send them out of first place in the East for the first time since June 11.	Sabathia was sharp early, allowing only a single through four innings. But he lost control of his breaking ball in the fifth and was done after allowing six hits and four runs in 6 2-3 innings.	"I still believe in CC," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "There's a guy that's done so many special things for us here. So I still believe in him."	B.J. Upton homered off Cody Eppley leading off the eighth to make it 5-2.	Before the game, Maddon bemoaned his ballclub's inability to get the clutch hits in support of a stellar staff.	The bottom of the order helped turn that around.	Sabathia cruised into the fifth, allowing only hit in the first, but Chris Gimenez led off with a double for Tampa Bay's second hit. Gimenez advanced to third on a wild pitch and Carlos Pena walked. Johnson, the No. 9 batter, had an RBI single and Desmond Jennings followed with a run-scoring hit.	Another wild pitch put runners on second and third and the third run scored on Evan Longoria's double-play grounder.	"It's no secret our offense -- we're not big boppers. We've got to scratch and claw for runs," Gimenez said. "Any time you can get three runs off CC Sabathia is huge."	Granderson immediately pulled New York to 3-2 with his 38th homer, a drive that a just eluded the glove of a leaping Upton and bounced off the top of the wall and into the Yankees bullpen in right-center.	With one out Eduardo Nunez hit a hard grounder down the third base line that caught umpire Jerry Meals on the right knee as he tried to jump out of the way -- as he came down, Meals smoothly motioned the ball was fair. It landed near the shortstop.	Whether or not the fans knew the ball deflected off the umpire who made an incorrect call to end a Yankees' loss in Baltimore a week ago, they booed heartily when Nunez ended up only on first base.	"I said to home plate umpire Scott Barry, 'That might be the best play he made in his life,'" Gimenez said. "It was much needed after the series we just had."	But the fans then broke out into a sustained standing ovation when Jeter hit an infield single off Johnson's glove at second base to pass Mays.	"It's kind of tough to think about it now, but yeah, it's pretty special," Jeter said. "Right now, there's a pennant race to think about."	Johnson didn't miss next time, though.	With two outs and runners on first and second, Rodriguez hit a sharp grounder. Johnson, shifted toward second base, made a diving stop in the hole and threw out A-Rod to end the threat.	Steve Pearce gave the Yankees the early lead a with an RBI single.	The Rays added a run in the ninth against Joba Chamberlain when Nunez, filling in at shortstop, made an error on Longoria's routine grounder.	Game notes	 Yankees LHP Andy Pettitte (broken left ankle) threw off the main mound, and worked on his pickoff moves and covering first base. He's set to make his first start since late June on Tuesday against Toronto. He'll be limited to about 70 pitches. ... Rays INF Sean Rodriguez (broken right hand) is expected to be activated from the DL Saturday. He took infield practice Friday. Rodriguez was hurt while punching a locker at Triple-A Durham.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

TORONTO -- With an eye-popping catch at a pivotal moment, Daniel Nava helped the Boston Red Sox avoid another dispiriting defeat.	Mauro Gomez hit a tiebreaking, two-run triple in the ninth inning and Nava made a game-saving grab in the outfield and Boston beat Toronto 8-5 on Friday night, snapping a six-game losing streak against the Blue Jays.	Boston had lost six of seven overall coming in, but bounced back after falling behind 3-0 and later blowing a 5-3 lead.	Ryan Lavarnway hit a three-run homer and finished with four RBIs but no one was more important than Nava, who hit a two-run single in the fifth, then left his feet to haul in a sinking line drive from Adam Lind in the eighth, keeping the go-ahead run rooted at second base.	"That was awesome," Lavarnway said of Nava's backhanded catch. "That's one of the most spectacular catches I've seen all year, especially in a tie game. I'd say that was a game-saving catch."	Nava said instinct took over as he raced into the gap to track down the ball.	"That one felt good, especially with what was on the line at the time," he said. "It meant a lot for the team."	Red Sox manager Bobby Valentine called Nava's grab "spectacular."	"Once it started slicing, I thought maybe he could intercept it," Valentine said. "I didn't know it would take a dive."	Chris Carpenter (1-0) got two outs for his first major league win and Andrew Bailey closed it out for his third save in four chances.	Darren Oliver (3-3) lost for the first time since May 23 at Tampa Bay, giving up one run and two hits in one-plus inning.	Jacoby Ellsbury singled off Oliver to begin the ninth, bringing Casey Janssen out of the bullpen. Mike Aviles flied out and Cody Ross singled before Gomez tripled to the wall in right-center. Lavarnway followed with a sacrifice fly.	"Mauro is a pretty good hitter," Valentine said. "He's been playing a lot against left-handers, but I left him in against a right-hander there and he didn't try to do too much. He took a slider into right-center field that I thought was caught for a second. It's a game of inches: Daniel makes the catch, Gose doesn't."	The Blue Jays took the lead by scoring three times off Daisuke Matsuzaka in the third, all without a hit. Moises Sierra was hit by a pitch and Anthony Gose and Colby Rasmus walked to load the bases. Sierra and Gose both scored on wild pitches before Rasmus came home on Lind's groundout.	"It was a real waste that I gave up a few runs without giving up any hits," Matsuzaka said through a translator. "It was really unfortunate that I wasn't able to make a small adjustment during that inning and get out of it quicker."	Boston tied it in the fourth on Lavarnway's homer, his second, and took a 5-3 lead on Nava's two-run single off Chad Jenkins in the fifth, snapping a stretch of 19 scoreless innings by Blue Jays relievers.	Aviles, who scored on Nava's hit, had escaped two batters earlier by evading a tag attempt from third baseman Brett Lawrie. Aviles was at second when Gomez grounded to third. Lawrie tried to tag Aviles, but he spun around, then scampered to the bag ahead of Lawrie as Gomez also reached safely.	"How about that move?," Valentine asked. "I don't think he was out of the baseline. Mike didn't give up, he gave everything he had to avoid the tag and he did."	Both Lawrie and Blue Jays manager John Farrell argued with umpire Todd Tichenor, saying Aviles had gone out of the baseline.	"To me, it looked like he went outside the established base line but the call stood as it was," Farrell said.	Lavarnway walked before Nava lined his tiebreaking single.	Lind tripled to chase Matsuzaka in the sixth, and Yunel Escobar followed with an RBI single off Clayton Mortensen, cutting it to 5-4.	Junichi Tazawa worked a scoreless seventh but Vicente Padilla couldn't preserve the win for Matsuzaka, surrendering a leadoff single to Rasmus in the eighth and giving up a game-tying double to Lawrie. Nava followed with a diving catch on Lind's liner to left, keeping Lawrie at second base, before Carpenter came on to finish the inning.	Toronto's Aaron Laffey gave up three runs and four hits in 3 2/3 innings, his shortest start of the season, and remains winless in five starts.	Jason Frasor pitched the sixth and seventh for Toronto, the 500th appearance of his Blue Jays career.	Game notes	 Toronto slugger Edwin Encarnacion was held out of the lineup with a sore left wrist. He was hit by a pitch from Seattle ace Felix Hernandez in Thursday's win over the Mariners. He is expected to play Saturday. ... Blue Jays pitching coach Bruce Walton, who had to leave the bench after being struck by Edwin Encarnacion's broken bat in the first inning Thursday, was back in the dugout Friday. Walton sustained bruises but avoided cuts and broken bones after he was hit by the barrel of Encarnacion's broken maple bat. ... Red Sox 2B Dustin Pedroia missed his second straight game following the birth of his second son and is expected to rejoin the team Saturday, Valentine said. ... Boston RHP John Lackey (elbow surgery) felt good after a 25-pitch bullpen session and will likely throw another next week, Valentine said. Lackey is aiming for a two-inning stint in an instructional league game before season's end.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

MIAMI --  The Cincinnati Reds got their first look at the Miami Marlins' new ballpark Friday night.	They're still trying to find home plate.	The Reds' push toward the playoffs was slowed by rookie Jacob Turner, who earned his first National League victory to help last-place Miami beat the NL Central leaders 4-0.	Cincinnati mustered just three hits and was shut out for only the third time, fewest in the NL.	"We just couldn't get anything going," manager Dusty Baker said. "Before you look up, it was 0-and-2 and there were two outs and nobody on base."	Turner (1-2) allowed two hits in a career-high seven innings to outpitch Bronson Arroyo (12-8), who gave up four runs in six innings.	The Reds became the final NL team to make their debut at spacious Marlins Park, and they missed their homer-friendly home in Cincinnati. Brandon Phillips and Joey Votto connected solidly on drives that didn't even make it to the warning track.	"This ballpark negated our long ball," Baker said. "Brandon hit one a ton out there we thought, and Joey hit one good, and those balls weren't even close."	Turner's 10th career start was his best yet. He walked two, struck out three, lowered his ERA to 3.75 and helped the Marlins break a three-game losing streak.	"We didn't put any pressure on those guys, which is a little disappointing," Arroyo said. "You've got to tip your hat. The guy doesn't have many big-league starts under his belt, and it was a good outing on his part."	Turner's only other career victory came July 22 for Detroit. The 21-year-old right-hander was acquired the next day by Miami in a trade that sent right-hander Anibal Sanchez and second baseman Omar Infante to the Tigers.	He has given up only three walks in 24 innings with Miami. Opponents are batting .184 against him.	"He's very impressive in the zone," Votto said. "It's impressive how few walks he has thrown. It bodes well for him."	Said Turner: "I was just being aggressive early, trying to get ahead as much as I could."	Arroyo, who had been 5-0 in his past six starts, gave up nine hits, including Greg Dobbs' fifth homer. The Marlins' Justin Ruggiano reached base three times and doubled home a run.	Miami is nearing the end of a disappointing season, and after the victory, manager Ozzie Guillen tweeted a profanity in reference to a reporter, saying he made "stupid comments about the miami team. ... we still play hard. ... i think u no watch."	The Marlins hustled plenty in the fifth inning, when they scored twice as a result of a wild sequence.	With Ruggiano at second base and Jose Reyes at first and two out, Carlos Lee singled to right field. After Ruggiano beat the throw home, Lee was hung up between first and second. Reyes then broke for home and beat shortstop Wilson Valdez's throw to the plate for a 4-0 lead.	Lee was then tagged out at second when he slid headfirst into Valdez's right leg, and he left the game with a strained neck. His status is day to day.	Miami took a 1-0 lead in the third. Rob Brantly led off with a single, advanced on a single by Bryan Petersen and scored on a double by Ruggiano.	Dobbs homered to lead off the fourth.	Game notes	 Reyes' sharp single in the fifth deflected off the gloves of Arroyo and a diving Phillips at second base, then continued into center field. ... The Marlins transferred INF-OF Emilio Bonifacio to the 60-day disabled list and selected the contract of INF Gil Velazquez, who entered the game for Lee in the sixth. ... Reds 3B Scott Rolen was given the night off. ... RHP Johnny Cueto, scheduled to start Saturday for the Reds, has a 5.63 ERA in three career starts in Miami. LHP Mark Buehrle, scheduled to start for Miami, has a 1.29 ERA in three starts against Cincinnati.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ATLANTA --  Kris Medlen has no idea what's going on.	The Atlanta Braves aren't complaining.	Medlen, who started the season as a little-known reliever, had a career-high 13 strikeouts, and the Braves pulled out a 2-1 victory over the first-place Washington Nationals when Andrelton Simmons scored on a throwing error in the ninth inning Friday night.	While Medlen wasn't around for the decision -- he was lifted for a pinch hitter after going seven -- the Braves kept alive a remarkable streak. They won for the 20th time in a row when Medlen is the starter, already a franchise record and the longest streak in the big leagues since the New York Yankees won 20 consecutive starts by Roger Clemens in 2001.	"If we keep on winning when I'm on the mound, then keep running me out there," said Medlen, whose streak dates to 2010 (he missed most of last season after elbow surgery). "It's just worked out that way. I don't know what it is. Those guys go to battle for me because they know I will go to battle for them."	Simmons reached on an infield single against Sean Burnett (1-2) and scurried to third when Michael Bourn lined a single that dropped in right field. Pinch-hitter Tyler Pastornicky hit a one-hop grounder to shortstop Ian Desmond, who had a shot at getting Simmons but threw wildly to the plate, the ball skipping all the way to the backstop while the rookie slid across with the winning run.	"I was just trying to get down the line in case they tried to turn two," Pastornicky said. "I didn't hear anything until I hit the bag. Then I turned around and saw everyone running toward me."	He was pummeled by his teammates during the celebration.	He didn't mind a bit.	"Awesome," Pastornicky said. "That's the best adrenaline rush you can get. That's what we're all playing for."	The Nationals are one of the NL's top fielding teams, but Desmond threw it low and to the left of the plate with the game on the line. Catcher Kurt Suzuki made a half-hearted stab at it, knowing he had no chance to make the tag even if he scooped it up.	"He hit a kind of slow chopper and I've got a prayer with Simmons at third. It was probably a one in 10 chance and I didn't get him," Desmond said. "It was the story of the night: they put the ball in play."	Not so for the Nationals, who fanned 17 times -- their most strikeouts in a game this season.  Craig Kimbrel (2-1) earned the win by whiffing the side in the top of the ninth on 10 pitches -- all strikes -- though Medlen did most of the heavy lifting. He allowed only a homer to Bryce Harper as the Braves snapped a three-game losing streak.	Medlen eclipsed his previous best for strikeouts set just 11 days earlier when he fanned 12 in a complete-game win over Colorado. In his last two starts at Turner Field, he has 25 strikeouts in 16 innings and joked that the hard-throwing Kimbrel -- who has a staggering 101 strikeouts in 54 1/3 innings -- was trying to follow his lead when he blew away the Nationals during his lone inning on the mound.	"I'm sure when he saw all the strikeouts I had, he was getting a little jealous," Medlen said with a grin.	Washington's Ross Detwiler wasn't as dominant as Medlen, but the left-hander was just as effective. He went six innings, allowing seven hits and one run while striking out five.	Like Medlen, Detwiler didn't factor in the decision, missing a chance to become Washington's fourth 10-win pitcher along with Gio Gonzalez (19-7), Stephen Strasburg (15-6) and Jordan Zimmermann (10-8).	"Det pitched a hell of a ball game. You've got to tip your hat to Medlen," said Washington manager Davey Johnson, whose team still leads the Braves by a comfortable 7 1/2 games in the NL East and is closing in on clinching at least a wild-card spot in the playoffs. "We just had a little error at the end. Otherwise, it looked good. I don't worry about those mistakes. Our defense has been outstanding. It's just tough to lose that way."	The Braves broke the scoreless duel in the fourth. Freddie Freeman led off with a double, Dan Uggla walked and David Ross grounded into a forceout, moving Freeman to third. The runner was nearly caught off the bag when Desmond, realizing he would have a tough time doubling up Ross at first, wheeled and threw back to third.	Freeman dove back just ahead of the tag, then scored when Simmons went deep enough to right for a sacrifice fly.	The 1-0 lead held up the sixth. Harper drove Medlen's first pitch into the seats in left-center, an opposite-field shot for the rookie's 19th homer of the season.	"I made a mistake and we paid for it," Medlen said. "But we came out on top in the end."	Game notes	 Simmons was back in the lineup after missing the final two games of the Milwaukee series with a sprained right ankle. He took some grounders before batting practice and declared himself ready to play. ... Facing the left-handed Detwiler, the Braves rested Bourn and C Brian McCann. But Bourn came on as a pinch-hitter in the seventh, stayed in the game and played a big role in the win. ... The Nationals failed to become the first Washington team since the AL champion Senators in 1933 to win 90 games in a season. They'll get another chance Saturday when Edwin Jackson (9-10) faces Atlanta's Tommy Hanson (12-8).	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Yu Darvish can throw fastballs by hitters. He can also freeze them with the slow-breaking curve.	Darvish surpassed 200 strikeouts in his rookie season while getting his 15th victory for the AL West-leading Texas Rangers in a 9-3 win against the Seattle Mariners on Friday night.	"Instead of trying to incorporate all the weapons he has, he's coming out of the bullpen recognizing what's working and he's using them," manager Ron Washington said. "One time it's his slider, one time it's his four-seamer. Today, it was his cutter ... and the slow breaking ball."	Darvish (15-9) struck out nine in seven innings. The 6-foot-5 right-hander from Japan often complemented his mid-90s fastball with a breaking pitch about 30 mph slower.	"It's a tough pitch, something you're not used to," Seattle third baseman Kyle Seager said. "It definitely throws your timing off a little bit. He located really well with it. When he threw them, he threw it with a purpose."	Ian Kinsler and Josh Hamilton homered for the Rangers against Hisashi Iwakuma (6-5), like Darvish a former Pacific League MVP in Japan and now a rookie in the major leagues.	Hamilton also had an RBI double in the Rangers' seven-run eighth off four relievers. He leads the majors with 42 homers and 123 RBIs.	Texas maintained a three-game division lead over Oakland, which beat Baltimore 3-2 for its seventh win in eight games. The Rangers and Athletics will play seven times over the last 10 games of the regular season.	Darvish retired 12 of his last 13 batters, striking out seven in that stretch. He allowed only two hits and walked two while throwing 79 of his 110 pitches for strikes.	Darvish made his major league debut against the Mariners five months ago, a game he won after giving up four runs in the first inning. He had a 9.00 ERA in three previous starts against them.	"Just the difference between throwing against them tonight and my previous outings against them, I think it's just throwing strikes," Darvish said through his translator. "Or more precisely, not feeling like I have to throw a strike."	It was Darvish's third consecutive start of at least seven innings while allowing three hits or less. The only other Rangers pitcher to ever do that was Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan, now the team president. He did it in 1990.	With 205 strikeouts, Darvish is the first major league rookie over 200 since Daisuke Matsuzaka struck out 201 batters for Boston in 2007. He is the 16th rookie, sixth in the American League, with 200 strikeouts.	It was only the eighth time two Japanese starters pitched against other in the majors, but Darvish and Iwakuma faced each other six times in Japan. Darvish last season threw a complete game for Hokkaido in a 2-0 win over Rakuten and Iwakuma, who worked 8 2/3 innings in that game.	After Carlos Peguero led off the fifth with a strikeout, Darvish's fourth of the game and 200th of the season, the Japanese star quickly added to that total. Trayvon Robinson took a called third strike and Munenori Kawasaki struck out swinging, missing a 94 mph pitch right after taking a 62 mph curve over the plate.	"The hitters, I felt like they were starting to time all my other pitches, or their timing was starting to come together," Darvish said. "I talked it over with (catcher Geovany) Soto during the game to start using that slower curve more."	Michael Saunders led off the Seattle fourth with a 12-pitch walk. Seager followed with a double and Saunders scored on a sacrifice fly by Jesus Montero. In their previous game at Rangers Ballpark on May 30, the Mariners won 21-8.	Saunders led off the ninth with his 15th homer.	Iwakuma struck out four and walked one in 5 1/3 innings. He gave up seven hits, and the only runs he allowed were on the two solo homers.	Kinsler's ball skipped over the top of the left-center field wall and ricocheted off a chair in the Mariners' bullpen and back onto the field. It was initially ruled a double, but it didn't take umpires long to correctly reverse their call after watching the replay.	Hamilton was back in the lineup after getting an injection in his sore left knee and missing a game. He pulled a ball into the second deck in right field in the third.	After Elvis Andrus led off the eighth with a double, he scored on a double by Hamilton. Andrus had a bases-loaded triple to make it 9-1.	"I can't count how many things we did wrong," Mariners manager Eric Wedge said. "When you get steamrolled like that, it should be one helluva of a wake-up call. ... Those innings can't happen."	Game notes	 Darvish is 4-1 with a 2.32 ERA his last six starts. ... The tarp wasn't taken off the field until an hour before the game, and there was still a light rain falling when the game started on time. It stopped about midway through the game. ... Seattle's defense turned consecutive inning-ending double plays. After David Murphy's liner ended the sixth, Kinsler's attempted bunt in the seventh was caught in the air by pitcher Josh Kinney and turned into a double play.

HOUSTON -- With one swing of the bat from Jimmy Rollins on Friday night, the Philadelphia Phillies put a tough loss to the Houston Astros a night before behind them.	Rollins hit a leadoff homer, Domonic Brown had a two-run shot and John Mayberry and Ryan Howard each had three RBIs as the Phillies beat the Astros 12-6.	The Phillies rebounded from Thursday night's 6-4 loss to Houston, which broke a seven-game winning streak and left them four games back for the second NL wild-card spot. Friday's win cut it to 3½, with the Cardinals and Dodgers still playing on the West Coast.	"It's huge," Philadelphia starter Cole Hamels said of Rollins' homer. "That's something that Jimmy's done a lot in his career, and when he's able to do that, it really kind of puts the edge into our favor and really gets guys fired up to go out and perform at the highest level. With what we have at stake going on right now, that's what we need."	Rollins' homer keyed a four-run first inning on a night when the Phillies came one run shy of a season high.	"We don't have too many where we can kind of relax," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said. "At the same time, tonight, that was good for us. Getting some hits and scoring some runs was good for us."	Rollins downplayed the importance of his homer, but did acknowledge that it started the night on a high note.	"That was probably a good thing," he said. "Even better, we didn't stop there. This team plays us tough. Always have, don't know why. Whether they're a team well over .500 or a team well under .500, we show up and we have a problem with them."	A two-run homer by Matt Downs got Houston within 5-3 in the fourth. Mayberry's two-run single in the fifth stretched the lead to 7-3.	Justin Maxwell added a solo shot in the fifth for the last-place Astros.	Hamels (15-6) gave up four runs and seven hits while fanning eight over seven innings, and tied a career high for wins set in 2007. It was the first victory over the Astros for the left-hander in his last five tries, and his first win overall since Aug. 18 after not factoring into the decision in his last three outings.	"If you get four runs off Cole Hamels, then it's a big night offensively," Downs said. "It is always tough to put runs up against a guy like that, but they swung the bats extremely well tonight."	Hamels threw 95 pitches, ending a streak of 14 straight games with at least 100 pitches.	He liked having a big lead before stepping on the mound.	"Just being able to come out and put up the runs early is huge, just because you want to just get the momentum back," Hamels said. "Especially after last night, you want to get things rolling again and get the positive mojo going so we can get back into how we know we've been playing baseball for the last week."	Edgar Gonzalez (2-1), starting in place of Bud Norris -- scratched on Thursday because of a blister on the index finger of his throwing hand -- needed 32 pitches to get through the first inning and was done after the fourth.	Brown's homer, to the second deck in right field, made it 9-4 in the seventh.	After Rollins homered into the right-field seats for his 42nd career leadoff shot, extending his team record, Juan Pierre drew a walk, stole second base and scored on a single by Chase Utley. Utley swiped second base before making it 3-0 when he scored on a ground-rule double by Howard. Mayberry's two-out RBI single left the Phillies up 4-0.	Mayberry, who finished with three hits, doubled in the fourth and scored on a single by Kevin Frandsen to push the lead to 5-1.	Chuckie Fick walked Utley and Howard with one out in the fifth before being lifted for Fernando Rodriguez. After an intentional walk to Brown loaded the bases, Mayberry's single was deflected by Rodriguez and rolled to second baseman Jose Altuve. Utley and Carlos Ruiz scored before Altuve could get the throw to the plate and the Phillies increased the lead to 7-3.	Utley had an RBI double in the eighth and Howard drove in two runs with a single.	Game notes	Jeff Kent, who played for the Astros from 2003-04, was scheduled to throw out the first pitch on Friday as Houston continues the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the franchise. But Kent was still recovering from breaking four ribs and puncturing one of his lungs in a recent dirt bike accident, so his 9-year-old son Kaeden threw the pitch. Kent is set to appear "Survivor: Philippines," the 25th season of the show, which premieres later this month. "The opportunity came for me to challenge myself and compete and compete socially, which was a challenge in itself," he said of the show. "It was a fun experience." ... Ruiz was the only player in Philadelphia's lineup without a hit Friday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Switch-hitter Kendrys Morales has been struggling from the right side of the plate all season.	When he pinch-hit in the eighth inning, the Royals brought in a left-hander trying to play the percentages. The move backfired.	Morales hit a two-run homer and the Los Angeles Angels rallied for a 9-7 victory over Kansas City on Friday night.	Several hours before the game, a man shot and wounded a female parking lot employee between the stadiums that are home to the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals before killing himself, police said.	The pair were both in their 40s and knew each other, but police did not elaborate on their relationship. The woman was taken to a hospital in critical condition.	There was no mention of the shooting over the public address system at Kauffman Stadium.	Morales entered the game with a .209 batting average and four home runs batting right-handed, and .290 with 14 home runs swinging left-handed.	"He's got power from both sides," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "He's strong. There's no doubt he can drive the ball from the right side. This year it's really clear that any opposing manager wants to get him on the right side. It's the right move to make and fortunately he came through."	Morales does not care if opponents think he is a weak right-handed hitter.	"Just let them think that," he said through an interpreter.	Morales homered on the first pitch from Tim Collins (5-3) with Mark Trumbo aboard to make it 7-all.	"That situation called for being aggressive," Morales said. "That was like a new breath of fresh air for the team."	Collins threw 11 pitches, faced four batters and retired none, allowing two singles and hitting Albert Pujols on an 0-2 count.	"I think I made a rookie mistake and gave Morales exactly what he was looking for," Collins said. "After that, I made some good pitches and they hit them.  I just tried to do too much.  He was looking fastball in that situation.  Coming out of the bullpen I have to not give him something to hit."	Jeremy Jeffress replaced Collins and walked Torii Hunter on five pitches with the bases loaded to force home Mike Trout with the go-ahead run. Hunter is hitting .431 with 15 RBIs in his past 16 games.	"A big hit from Kendrys and a big at-bat from Torii," Scioscia said.	Jordan Walden (3-2), the fourth of six Angels pitchers, picked up the victory, although he threw only two pitches. Ernesto Frieri got his 19th save in 21 opportunities.	Billy Butler, Mike Moustakas and Jeff Francoeur homered for Kansas City.	The Royals took advantage of second baseman Howie Kendrick's error to score three unearned runs in the sixth. Francoeur, who was hitting just .159 in his previous 20 games, hit a two-run homer with two out. Moustakas' sacrifice fly scored the first run of the inning.	Butler and Moustakas homered in the second to give the Royals a 2-0 lead. Butler's home run, which caromed off a billboard at the top of the Royals' bullpen, was the 100th of his career. He had been stuck on 99 since Aug. 11, going 93 at-bats without a homer. Two batters later Moustakas hit his 20th home run.	Angels starter C.J. Wilson left with a 4-3 lead in the sixth and got a no-decision.	"I think he settled down after a couple of mistakes," Scioscia said. "One was to Billy Butler, he tried to force a fastball inside and didn't get it there for a home run. The next pitch was down but in the middle to Moustakas. That one wasn't really a terrible pitch. After that he settled in and got some big outs, made some good pitches."	Royals starter Bruce Chen exited with a 6-4 lead in the seventh, but the bullpen failed to maintain it.	It was the second consecutive game the Kansas City bullpen could not hold a lead, giving up three runs the final three innings in a 4-3 loss Thursday at Minnesota.	The Angels scored four times in the fourth, two on Kendrick's double and two on Alberto Callaspo's two-out single.	The Angels scored an unearned run in the ninth after center fielder Jason Bourgeois' error.	Game notes	 Pujols returned to first base for the first time since injuring his right leg on Aug. 22 at Boston. He missed four games after the injury and started the next 16 games as the DH before playing first against the Royals. "I think he feels comfortable with it and our medical staff feels comfortable with it," Scioscia said. "I think he's much more comfortable when he can play the field and contribute to the team." ... Hunter batted cleanup for just the 16th time this season. He had been primarily hitting second. ... RHP Zack Greinke, who won the 2009 Cy Young Award while with the Royals, will start Saturday for the Angels. RHP Jeremy Guthrie, who is 4-0 with a 1.70 ERA in his past seven starts, will start for the Royals.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

MILWAUKEE --  Mike Fiers knows how damaging the loss might be for the surging Milwaukee Brewers.	"The playoffs are right around the corner, and we need to win as many games as possible," the Brewers' pitcher said. "Sure, there's a little bit of pressure there, but there is no excuse for me throwing the ball all over the place. I need to get back to pitching and start in the first inning."	Lucas Duda homered and doubled, Jonathon Niese pitched six strong innings and the New York Mets snapped a six-game losing streak, beating the Brewers 7-3 on Friday night.	The loss dropped Milwaukee back to .500 at 72-72 -- four games behind St. Louis for the second National League wild-card spot.	Fiers (9-8) gave up six hits and four runs in five innings for Milwaukee, which had won 18 of 23 coming in.	"One game is not going to change it," Fiers said. "We had a really good stretch of wins here. We can still win the series. It's one game. If we can come back and win these next two games, it would be nice. It doesn't really matter where we're at. We need to win."	Niese (11-9), who had lost three straight starts, settled down after giving up two second-inning runs, allowing six hits, three walks and the two runs. He also had two hits and scored a run, helping the Mets to their biggest offensive output since a 9-5 extra-inning victory over Philadelphia on Aug. 28.	Daniel Murphy also homered for New York.	Fiers struggled from the start, and the Mets scored twice in both the first and second innings, equaling their offensive output in three losses in a sweep against Washington.	In the first, Murphy walked with one out, went to third on David Wright's double and scored on Ike Davis' groundout. Wright scored on Duda's ground-rule double.	The Mets made it 4-0 in the second when Niese singled with one out and, two batters later, Murphy hit a ball into the second deck in right field for his sixth home run of the season.	"Just command again," Brewers manager Ron Roenicke said about Fiers. "He came out not throwing strikes. He tried to throw fastballs away and was pulling them across the plate a lot on the lefties. It was command, with the offspeed pitches also."	Milwaukee answered with two in the second, and it would have been more but for two runners getting thrown out at home. Jonathan Lucroy and Carlos Gomez led off with singles, and Travis Ishikawa doubled in Lucroy. Jean Segura grounded to Niese, who caught Gomez off third base, and Wright eventually tagged him out in a rundown. Fiers then singled in Ishikawa for his second RBI of the season. Norichika Aoki bounced to third, and Segura was tagged out at home. Rickie Weeks struck out to end the threat.	Shoddy defense cost Milwaukee in the sixth.	Duda homered to right center off reliever Manny Parra to lead off the inning -- his second since being recalled from Triple-A Buffalo.	Then, with one out, Andres Torres reached on an error by shortstop Jean Segura, who threw high to first on the slow roller. Torres scored on Josh Thole's double. Niese followed with an infield single that caromed off third baseman Aramis Ramirez's chest -- barely keeping alive his errorless streak of 42 games. Ruben Tejada followed with what should have been an easy double-play grounder to Ramirez, but Rickie Weeks' relay throw to first bounced in the dirt and got away from Ishikawa, scoring Thole.	"We haven't played this type game in quite a while," Roenicke said. "I know we're going to have one of these once in a while, but we certainly need to bounce back tomorrow and play a lot better."	The Brewers threatened in the eighth with leadoff singles by Ryan Braun and Ramirez before a spectacular Mets double play, as Lucroy grounded sharply up the middle to a diving Tejada, who from his stomach flipped the ball to second, where Murphy pivoted and threw quickly to first.	Milwaukee added a run in the ninth on Nyjer Morgan's RBI triple.	The Brewers had won nine straight at home, tying a Miller Park record, and were one shy of equaling the franchise mark. The streak included a sweep of the Braves earlier in the week that put them over .500 for the first time since they were 4-3 on April 12. Milwaukee was 12 games under .500 as recently as Aug. 19 before its recent streak made it a wild-card contender.	"Nobody expects us to be in this thing, and I think we've played that way, and that's why we've gotten back in it," Roenicke said. "If you start looking at every game like it's `you have to win,' I don't think the young guys will do well with that. So we haven't gone there."	The Mets -- 19-38 since the All-Star Break entering play -- had lost eight of nine and came in 13 games under .500 for the first time since the end of the 2009 season.	"They play great here, we know they play great here," Mets manager Terry Collins said about the Brewers. "They're in the hunt. They don't make many mistakes, so when they do, you've got to capitalize on it, and we did tonight."	Game notes	 Mets 3B David Wright extended his hitting streak to eight games with his first-inning double. ... Brewers 1B Corey Hart missed his fourth straight game with plantar fasciitis in his left foot. ... New York Mets RHP Jenrry Mejia starts on Saturday -- exactly two years since his last major league start. Mejia started three games for New York in 2010 and did not pitch in the majors in 2011 after Tommy John surgery. He has one relief appearance since being recalled Sept. 4.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Chris Sale is a big part of the AL Cy Young Award conversation, his reliever-to-starter transition season for Chicago already a rousing success.	There's only one achievement he wants to talk about, though, and that's a spot in the playoffs for the White Sox.	Sale threw six scoreless innings to notch his 17th victory after being rained out the night before, helping the White Sox keep their one-game AL Central lead by beating the Minnesota Twins 6-0 on Friday.	"Any time he pitches, you feel confident that you're going to have a chance to win the game. Spirits are high," manager Robin Ventura said.	Sale (17-6) scattered three singles and struck out five without a walk, cruising to his third win in three starts against the Twins this year, surrendering only two runs in 20 innings. Sale lowered his ERA to 2.78, third in the AL, and he's tied for second in wins. The Cy Young competition this fall is tough, but Sale has earned a spot among the front-runners.	Just don't expect him to acknowledge that.	"When you start thinking about things like that you get a little selfish, and what's really important slips away," the 23-year-old Sale said. "I want to play for this team. I'm not trying to win any awards or anything like that. The only award I want is a big, shiny trophy at the end."	Sale was supposed to pitch on Thursday at home against Detroit, but the last matchup of the season between the two division front-runners was postponed until Monday by the wet weather. The Tigers, who beat Cleveland 4-0, are one game back in the race.	"As long as we win, what they do doesn't really matter," catcher A.J. Pierzynski said. "We've just got to go out and try to win games, and hopefully we can do that for the next couple of days."	Dayan Viciedo had two RBIs, Kevin Youkilis homered and Alex Rios doubled, scored and drove in a run for the White Sox, who played without injured slugger Adam Dunn for the seventh straight game. Dunn, who has a strained right oblique muscle, could return to the lineup on Saturday.	Twins starter Esmerling Vasquez (0-2) walked three straight batters in the fourth inning after a one-out single, with Viciedo's walk forcing in the second run for Chicago. Then with two outs in the sixth, after a broken-bat single by Pierzynski and a walk to Viciedo, Kyle Waldrop relieved Vasquez. Alexei Ramirez greeted him with a single to make it 3-0.	The White Sox are 12-4 against the Twins this year, but they're just 5-12 against the Tigers with losses in nine of the last 10 meetings. With 19 games remaining, the White Sox play legitimate contenders only eight more times including the pivotal makeup game on Monday. They can't afford to slip up against faded foes like the Twins, who are jostling with the Indians for fourth place.	Sale made sure they didn't, letting only two runners reach second base. Youkilis helped him out at third base with consecutive catches of hard line drives, going down on the ground to his right to snag Jamey Carroll's and then gloving Josh Willingham's on the next play.	"It seems like every time we need him to go out and throw a good game he does," Pierzynski said.	The Twins were, again, impressed.	"The ball sometimes disappears," manager Ron Gardenhire said. "That's telling you that the guy has great stuff."	Game notes	 LHP Francisco Liriano (5-11, 5.37 ERA) will pitch on Saturday against his former team so the White Sox can give starters Jose Quintana and Gavin Floyd extra rest. Liriano has been bouncing back and forth between the rotation and the bullpen. RHP Samuel Deduno (6-3, 3.55 ERA) is scheduled to take the mound for the Twins, coming off a strong start on Monday when he beat the Indians with seven innings, six strikeouts and three hits, two runs and three walks allowed. ...  Floyd in 2008 was the last to win 17 games for the White Sox. ... Joe Mauer missed his fourth straight game due to back spasms, but the Twins said he's feeling better. With Ryan Doumit also day to day with a strained rib cage, Chris Herrmann was called up from Double-A New Britain to be the emergency catcher. ... Ventura said when Dunn returns Dewayne Wise will be in the mix with Viciedo and Alejandro De Aza for time in LF and CF.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PHOENIX --  Hunter Pence has the most RBIs on the San Francisco Giants since he was acquired in a deadline deal with Philadelphia.	Now he's looking for a few more hits.	Pence belted his first grand slam in more than four years, Matt Cain dodged trouble for five-plus innings and the Giants beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 6-2 on Friday night.	Pence has 34 RBIs and 37 hits with San Francisco. He is batting .233 with four homers in 41 games with the Giants.	"I need to get more hits is what that tells me," Pence said, "Make them pitch to (Buster) Posey with runners on."	Pence's third career grand slam capped a five-run third inning for the NL West-leading Giants, who won for the third time in four games and are 11-5 in their past 16.	Cain sparked the outburst with a leadoff walk and moved to second on Marco Scutaro's one-out infield single. After Pablo Sandoval singled to center to load the bases, Posey hit a grounder to third and Cain slid under Ryan Wheeler's throw on a close play to make it 1-0.	Pence followed with a long drive into the left-field stands for his 21st homer of the season.	"You can never walk the pitcher," Diamondbacks starter Tyler Skaggs said. "I thought they were good pitches but I ended up walking him and then the whole inning kind of exploded."	Cain (14-5) walked three in the first and stranded five runners over the first two innings.	The right-hander allowed four hits, walked a season-high five and also hit a batter. He was charged with one run and struck out two.	"That was a gutsy effort," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "It just got to a point where I had to go get him."	Cain failed to make it through six innings for the second time in his last three starts.	"I couldn't put away some guys like I wanted to," Cain said. "I got too fine with some pitches."	Reliever Santiago Casilla also drove in a run for the Giants, who remained 7 1/2 games ahead of Los Angeles with 18 games remaining. The Dodgers beat St. Louis 8-5 on Friday night.	Chris Johnson drove in both runs for the Diamondbacks, who stayed 4 1/2 games behind the Cardinals for the second wild-card spot. Skaggs (1-2) allowed five runs and five hits in four innings after lasting only three innings in his previous start against San Diego on Sept. 7.	"It's been unacceptable on my part the last two outings," the 21-year-old left-hander said. "It's almost been embarrassing."	Arizona left 15 men on base against seven Giants pitchers.	"We certainly had our opportunities," manager Kirk Gibson said. "A lot of plays we didn't play very well tonight. We made it harder on ourselves and we didn't capitalize on the opportunities we did have."	After putting the first two runners on three times in the first five innings, the Diamondbacks finally broke through in the sixth.	Cain hit Miguel Montero in the foot and Justin Upton singled to right. Cain then gave way to Jose Mijares, who yielded an RBI single to right by pinch-hitter Johnson that made it 5-1.	Guillermo Mota came on and hit John McDonald in the left shoulder to load the bases before retiring Chris Young on a line drive caught by a diving Sandoval at third for the first out of the inning.	"That was a game-saving play," Bochy said. "If that ball gets down the line it's a different ballgame."	Jeremy Affeldt, the Giants' fourth pitcher in the inning, got Adam Eaton to ground into an easy force at home and struck out Aaron Hill to end the threat.	Casilla threaded a bases-loaded single into right field in the eighth for his first career hit, putting the Giants ahead 6-1.	"I think we were all kind of shocked he made contact," Bochy said. "He found a good place."	Johnson added an RBI single in the ninth for Arizona.	Game notes	 Sandoval, returning to the lineup after two days off, finished 3 for 4. . Cain threw 34 pitches in the first inning and 106 overall. . The roof at Chase Field was open during the game for the first time since June 9. . Diamondbacks LF Jason Kubel doubled off Angel Pagan at first in the seventh for his 13th outfield assist of the season, a new club record. ... Montero, who walked three times and was hit by a pitch, became the second Diamondbacks player to reach base four times without a hit in a nine-inning game. Luis Gonzalez accomplished the feat twice. ... Arizona's Double-A Mobile affiliate won its second straight Southern League championship series title Friday night and its rookie-level team in Missoula won the Pioneer League championship series. ... LHP Wade Miley, the second of three straight rookie southpaws, will take the mound for the Diamondbacks against veteran LHP Barry Zito. Zito is 5-8 in 19 career games against Arizona but 2-0 in three starts this year. ... The Diamondbacks will stage their first-ever alumni game after Saturday's game.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  The Oakland Athletics hardly needed any additional motivation for this key September series with playoff implications. Then injured pitcher Brandon McCarthy showed up in the clubhouse before the game.	Yoenis Cespedes hit a two-run homer while playing with a sore right wrist, and the AL wild card-leading A's beat Baltimore 3-2 on Friday night to prevent the Orioles from moving into sole possession of first place in the AL East.	"My body might be tired but I'm strong in my mind," Cespedes said.	Jonny Gomes hit a go-ahead RBI single in the fifth to back A's rookie Tommy Milone in the opener of an important series between surprising postseason contenders. Oakland (83-61) came off the field from batting practice to find McCarthy doing a crossword puzzle, barely a week after he was struck in the head by a line drive and underwent surgery.	"I know it was a big pick-me-up for everybody to see him," manager Bob Melvin said.	The Orioles (81-63) remained tied atop the division with the New York Yankees, who lost 6-4 at home to Tampa Bay.	Milone (13-10) allowed one earned run over 6 1/3 innings to win for the fourth time in five starts. He induced three double plays, allowed six hits, struck out two and walked two. His 13 wins are an Oakland rookie record.	A's starters have walked three or fewer batters in 43 straight games. The defense turned four double plays in all.	"It's huge," Milone said. "It's momentum killers for them."	McCarthy, the team's Opening Day starter, was hit in the head by a liner from the Angels' Erick Aybar on Sept. 5. He was released from the hospital Tuesday.	Gomes had everybody sign a batting helmet for the pitcher with the words "heads up" written on the bill.	Cespedes, the rookie from Cuba, connected for his 19th home run and third in four games. That gave Oakland 85 homers since the All-Star break.	Cespedes played left field and batted cleanup a day after leaving a loss to the Angels in the fifth inning after injuring his right wrist on a slide.	"I'm going to rest after we get a championship," Cespedes said. "I'm going to be in the lineup every day."	Chris Davis then tied it at 2 when he hit his 26th home run leading off the fifth.	The sellout crowd of 35,067 -- a big turnout for fireworks night -- booed Baltimore starter Joe Saunders (2-2) when he intentionally walked Cespedes in the fifth.	Oakland's bullpen produced another impressive game. After All-Star Ryan Cook struck out two in a perfect eighth, Grant Balfour finished for his 18th save in 20th chances.	"We might be the first team in history to have fireworks after every game in the playoffs," Balfour joked of the unusually large crowd.	Matt Wieters beat out an infield single to start the ninth and Xavier Avery entered to pinch run. Pinch-hitter Endy Chavez struck out swinging, then Mark Reynolds flied out. Catcher Derek Norris threw out Avery stealing to end the 2-hour, 37-minute game that resembled a playoff atmosphere.	"We're fighting for the same goal and they made some good pitches when they needed," Reynolds said. "They got us to ground into some double plays. It's frustrating."	Another blow for the Orioles: Infielder Wilson Betemit is likely done for the season with further wrist problems.	Activated from the disabled list Sept. 1 after going down Aug. 12 with an injured right wrist, Betemit aggravated it again during batting practice.	"He felt it grab again. He's really down," manager Buck Showalter said. "I don't like our chances of getting him back this year."	Saunders allowed three runs and seven hits in six innings, struck out six and walked two. He had a two-start winning streak stopped in his fourth outing since being acquired from Arizona on Aug. 26.	The left-hander is 13-5 in 20 career starts against the A's, but was 4-0 with a 1.16 ERA over his previous four against Oakland with two complete games and a shutout.	The Orioles gave Saunders a lead in the third when Manny Machado scored on third baseman Josh Donaldson's error. The ball hit off of Donaldson's glove arm and popped high toward shortstop Stephen Drew.	Prior to this season, the last time these clubs met after the All-Star break each with records above .500 was Sept. 2, 1992, according to STATS LLC.	Oakland No. 9 hitter Adam Rosales doubled and scored as the A's improved to 52-4 when giving up two or fewer runs.	Game notes	 A's 3B Brandon Inge underwent successful arthroscopic surgery Thursday on his right shoulder to repair the labrum. The operation was performed in Detroit by Dr. Stephen Lemos, the Tigers' orthopedic surgeon. He hopes to be ready for spring training 2013. ... Orioles LHP Troy Patton (right ankle) is scheduled to throw an inning Sunday at instructional league. ... The Orioles still haven't named a starter for Sunday's series finale. LHP Randy Wolf is a candidate. ... RHP Jarrod Parker (10-8) pitches Saturday against Orioles LHP Zach Britton (5-2).	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN DIEGO --  Carlos Gonzalez has stood out as one of the few bright spots for the last-place Colorado Rockies.	Rookies Wilin Rosario and Jordan Pacheco had consecutive two-run doubles in the first inning to lead the Rockies to a 7-4 win over the San Diego Padres on Friday night.	But Gonzalez quietly went about his job by equaling his career high with four hits, all singles. He also stole two bases to become the first Rockie to reach the 20-20 club in three consecutive seasons.	"It means a lot because every year in spring training I always try to get better and get better numbers than the year before and stay consistent," Gonzalez said. "I'm always trying to get better and maybe in future I can do better things."	Rockies manager Jim Tracy appreciates Gonzalez's consistent play and the example he sets for the younger players.	"Carlos just plays, just like we are seeing with Dexter Fowler," Tracy said. "They are continuing to play. I think that's very important, that message to be sent to our younger players."	Gonzalez had his breakout season in 2010 when he set career highs in batting (.336), homers (34), RBIs (117) and stolen bases (26). He followed that up by hitting .296 with 26 homers and stealing 20 bases last season.	When he stole second base in the ninth inning, it gave Gonzalez 22 home runs with 20 stolen bases.	"I never stopped believing that my swing is going to get back to where I want it," Gonzalez said.	There's not much left to play for in a season when Colorado has clinched last place in the NL West. But the Rockies (58-85) still need to win 10 of their final 19 games to avoid tying the club's worst record at 67-95.	Chris Nelson and rookie Charlie Blackmon each hit solo homers as the Rockies won for just the third time in 11 games. Nelson tied his career high with three hits.	Rosario and Pacheco's big hits keyed a five-run first inning in which Colorado sent 10 men to the plate against Andrew Cashner (3-4).	Rookie Yonder Alonso hit a grand slam in the first inning for San Diego, which had won seven of eight overall and 11 of its previous 13 at home.	"We got right back in the game with the grand slam," Padres manager Bud Black said. "We had a couple of opportunities, but couldn't come away with a big hit to keep anything going."	Guillermo Moscoso (3-1), the second of five Rockies relievers, allowed two hits in 1 2/3 scoreless innings. Rafael Betancourt pitched the ninth for his 29th saves in 34 chances.	Cashner lasted just 3 2/3 innings, giving up six runs on 10 hits. The right-hander was making his second start since coming off the disabled list on Sept. 1.	After San Diego cut the Rockies' lead to 5-4 in the first inning, Nelson gave the Rockies a 6-4 lead with a solo homer, his ninth, in the third inning. Blackmon hit his first homer in the eighth off Brad Boxberger.	Colorado scored five runs in the first as the first five players reached base safely in an inning that included three infield singles and a hit batter.	After the Rockies loaded the bases, Rosario hit a ball that short hopped the wall in left center for a two-run double. Pacheco then doubled in two more runs. Nelson's high chopper with one out went for an infield single to drive in the final run.	The Padres got right back in the game as Tyler Chatwood allowed one-out singles to Will Venable and Chase Headley before loading the bases by walking Yasmani Grandal. Alonso followed by hitting a 2-1 fastball into the left-field stands for his first career grand slam.	Game notes	 Cashner got his first big-league hit with a bunt single in the second. ..

LOS ANGELES --  Luis Cruz wasn't a significant piece of the Los Angeles Dodgers' roster until third baseman Jerry Hairston Jr. went down for the rest of the season in mid-August with inflammation in his left hip. Since then, the four-year veteran has done more than his share to help keep his team in the postseason hunt.	Cruz greeted St. Louis reliever Edwin Mujica with a first-pitch, three-run homer in the sixth inning Friday night, and the Dodgers tightened up the NL wild card race with an 8-5 victory over the Cardinals.	"It was very uplifting," Dodgers left fielder Shane Victorino said. "In this game, confidence is very big. But to me, he's always been a great player, I played against him, and he's never gotten has his opportunity to really go out there and shine. Then it took Jerry getting hurt to get him his opportunity. And when he got it, he shined.	"He's one of those guys on this team that nobody talks about, but yet he's come up with big hit after big hit and played great defense. He's playing consistently at a high level, and I'm very happy for him," Victorino said.	Trevor Rosenthal (0-2) inherited a 4-3 lead from fellow rookie Joe Kelly after five innings and gave up a leadoff single by Andre Ethier, who got the Dodgers back into the game in the third with a two-run homer. Rosenthal hit Hanley Ramirez on a 1-0 count two outs later and manager Mike Matheny made the switch to Mujica -- who has given up 17 runs and six homers in 21 1/3 career innings against the Dodgers.	"I felt a little out of my timing today, so before that at-bat I just told myself to take a pitch, just to see if he was thinking about pitching me inside," Cruz said. "But I was relaxed, and I saw it just hanging there. So I just reacted and hit it. But I wasn't trying to hit a homer."	Mujica had allowed one run in 19 innings over his 20 previous appearances with St. Louis after he was acquired in a trade with Miami on July 31. The Dodgers had a similar come-from-behind victory over the Cardinals on May 20 at Dodger Stadium, when pinch hitter Scott Van Slyke hit a go-ahead three-run homer off Mark Rzepczynski in the seventh inning.	"It was one pitch," Matheny said. "We got him into trouble by putting a couple of guys on base, and that usually adds some tough outs. But he's been terrific for us. Joe was struggling, and it was one of those days for the bullpen to come in and pick up the starter in those middle innings. We all know very well that it's hurt us, and it continued to do so tonight."	Adrian Gonzalez made it 8-4 with a two-run double in the seventh off the glove of a diving Matt Holliday.	"Tonight we scored some runs and played the game right," Cruz said. "It's our time now. And from now on we're going to keep playing hard every day. We've got to keep fighting. We're never going to give up, and I think we're going to come through and win a wild card spot."	Rookie Shawn Tolleson (2-1) pitched 1 1/3 innings of hitless relief for the victory after the Dodgers got starter Chris Capuano off the hook. Capuano was charged with four runs -- two earned -- and six hits in four innings, including second-inning solo homers by Yadier Molina and Matt Carpenter and a two-run shot in the third by Holliday.	The temperature was 96 degrees when Capuano threw his first pitch, and the 34-year-old left-hander grew even hotter under the collar in the second inning when Molina drove an 0-2 pitch to left-center for his 19th homer and Carpenter added his sixth of the season two batters later. It was the 12th time Capuano allowed two homers in an inning during his eight big league seasons.	The Dodgers, averaging only 1.6 runs over their previous eight games, got on the board in the bottom half when Gonzalez led off with a double and scored on a groundout by Cruz, but the Cardinals extended their lead to 4-1 in the third when Carlos Beltran reached on a two-out throwing error by shortstop Ramirez and Holliday cashed it in with his 27th home run.	The Dodgers responded in the bottom half when Ethier got the green light from manager Don Mattingly on a 3-0 pitch and drove his 18th homer deep into the pavilion seats in right-center after a two-out walk to Victorino -- back in the leadoff spot for the first time since Aug. 27 with second baseman Mark Ellis getting the night off.	"Dre's home run on a 3-0 green light was huge," Mattingly said. "He's dangerous and especially aggressive when you let him go on 3-0. This was a good time for those home runs. It's a two-game swing. I'm just glad I don't have to talk about another loss."	Second baseman Nick Punto, starting his third game with the Dodgers since he was acquired on Aug. 25 in the nine-player trade with Boston, slid head-first into first base each of his first two times up on slow bouncers to third baseman David Freese. He was out the first time and safe the second time, but was picked off by catcher Molina in the fifth with pinch-hitter Bobby Abreu batting and the Dodgers down 4-3.	Kelly allowed three runs and four hits in five innings with two strikeouts and two walks.	Game notes	 The crowd of 40,167 pushed the Dodgers home attendance total to 3,022,468. Last year they failed to reach 3 million for the first time in a non-strike season since 1992. ... RHP Chris Carpenter is scheduled to throw 90 pitches in a simulated game on Saturday with the hope of making his season debut for the Cardinals by next week. He was shut down during spring training because of thoracic outlet syndrome and underwent surgery July 19. ... Los Angeles closer Kenley Jansen, sidelined since Aug. 28 because of an irregular heartbeat, was given clearance to the team's medical staff to pitch again for the Dodgers as early as next Tuesday. ... Dodgers LHP Ted Lilly, who hasn't pitched for the Dodgers since May 23 because of shoulder inflammation, was shut down for the rest of the season and will undergo surgery on Sept. 21. He finished 5-1 with a 3.14 ERA in eight starts. ... Molina had no RBIs in 24 at-bats this season against the Dodgers prior to his homer.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

CHICAGO --  Pittsburgh Pirates manager Clint Hurdle figured snapping a season-high seven-game losing streak would be no easy task.	Joel Hanrahan made it about as dramatic as it can get.	Hanrahan allowed two runs in the ninth, then struck out Dave Sappelt with the bases loaded to preserve a 7-6 win over the Chicago Cubs on Saturday.	Andrew McCutchen homered and reached base four times for Pittsburgh, which had dropped 11 of 13.	"If it was about everybody's comfort, you'd choose to do it differently," Hurdle said. "But usually when you push through something like we're going through right now, it's gonna take some drama, and it's gonna take some wherewithal, and some confidence and some grit.	"It was enough today to get us out of the direction we were headed in and headed in a new direction."	Wandy Rodriguez (11-13) held Chicago to three runs -- one earned -- in helping the Pirates stop their free-fall in the NL playoff race. Pittsburgh had lost 17 of 22, yet was just three games behind St. Louis for the second NL wild-card slot entering the day.	Rodriguez improved to 3-0 with a 1.40 ERA over his last four starts after struggling initially upon being acquired midseason from Houston.	McCutchen launched Jason Berken's pitch off the rear fence behind the left-field bleachers leading off the third, his 28th homer of the season. He also singled and walked twice, improving to .394 in 27 career games at Wrigley Field.	Hanrahan allowed Alfonso Soriano's RBI single in the ninth and walked in a run, but held on for his 35th save.	"It's obviously not how we write it up, especially with a seven-game losing streak, you want to go out there and have it go smooth," Hanrahan said. "Being here in Chicago, dinner isn't good until about 6 o'clock anyway, so keep us around a little bit."	Starling Marte had an RBI triple, doubled and scored twice as Pittsburgh scored more than four runs for the first time since its losing streak began. The Pirates were aided by a pair of Cubs errors that led to four unearned runs.	Clint Barmes hit a solo homer in the seventh, and enjoyed the return of his double-play combination, Neil Walker, who started for the first time since Aug. 26 due to lower back tightness.	Walker went hitless in five at-bats, but his presence was felt elsewhere.	"Just looking over and seeing (Walker) out there, it brought a whole different feel to the clubhouse," Barmes said. "We need him out there. Having him out there puts everybody a little more at ease."	Berken (0-1) struggled in his Cubs debut, giving up eight hits in four innings, though just two of the six runs he allowed were earned.	Berken, who was claimed off waivers on Sept. 7 after Baltimore designated him for assignment, became the 12th starting pitcher the Cubs have used this season and the team-record 53rd player they've used overall.	"He was a victim of a couple of errors," Cubs manager Dale Sveum said. "Could have gotten into the fifth only giving up two, but the errors cost him pitches and the ability to go five or six today."	Anthony Rizzo had two hits and an RBI for Chicago, and Soriano drove in two runs, leaving him one RBI shy of his first 100 RBI season since 2005.	Starlin Castro had two hits and reached base three times, but missed a chance to move into a tie for the NL lead in triples when he tripped over second base on a double up the right field line in the eighth.	Josh Vitters' throwing error on a routine ball led to three unearned runs in the fourth, all scoring with two outs. Marte pounded an RBI triple to center, while Travis Snider and Garrett Jones drove in runs to cap the rally.	Game notes	 Cuban OF Jorge Soler made his first visit to a big league ballpark Saturday when he participated in pregame drills with the Cubs at Wrigley Field. The powerfully-built 20 year old put on an impressive display in batting practice, knocking two balls onto Waveland Avenue and three more that easily cleared the ivy in left. The Cubs won a hotly-contested bidding war for Soler, signing him to a nine-year, $30 million contract in June. . Hurdle declined to answer a pregame question about whether removing James McDonald from the starting rotation was an option. `'We're doing some internal talking in a lot of different areas. I had a talk with James yesterday. We'll just leave it at that right now," Hurdle said. McDonald lasted only 3 2/3 innings Friday and is 3-5 with a 7.08 ERA in the second half. . OF Alex Presley (right foot) was unavailable Saturday after being hit by a pitch in the ninth inning Friday.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

TORONTO --  As a tumultuous and disappointing season draws to a close, the Boston Red Sox are starting to see hopeful signs for the future.	Pedro Ciriaco drove in the tiebreaking run with a two-out double in the ninth inning Saturday, Cody Ross hit a solo homer and the Red Sox won their second straight, beating the Toronto Blue Jays 3-2.	"It's a good sign we're not laying down and dying," said catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia, who scored the go-ahead run. "We're continuing to fight even though we're as far out as we are. It shows a lot about this team. It's a good sign."	The victory moved Boston out of last place in the AL East, percentage points ahead of the Blue Jays, who have played two fewer games.	After stranding runners at third base three times in the previous five innings, the Red Sox finally broke through in the ninth. Saltalamacchia led off with a double against Steve Delabar (4-2), Ryan Lavarnway struck out and Saltalamacchia moved to third on Mike Aviles' flyball. Ciriaco followed with a double to left.	Manager Bobby Valentine praised Ciriaco, whose hit boosted his average to .300.	"His at-bats are as good as anyone on the team," Valentine said. "Everyone knows he can hit a fastball and he hits a 2-1 breaking ball. He's a good player."	Craig Breslow (1-0 AL, 3-0) worked one inning for the win and Andrew Bailey finished for his fourth save in five chances.	"I wish I had him all year," Valentine said of Bailey, who missed 116 games after right thumb surgery. "He's pitching with confidence. He's not afraid to challenge a hitter."	Bailey said the experience Boston's young players are getting this year could be beneficial next season.	"Those younger guys are definitely learning some great experiences and great things going into next year that will help us out in whatever role they play."	Boston's past three victories have seen the winning run scored in their last at-bat. Jacoby Ellsbury singled home Ciriaco in the ninth inning of Tuesday's 4-3 win over the Yankees, and Mauro Gomez hit a two-run triple in the ninth inning of Friday's 8-5 win at Toronto.	The Red Sox loaded the bases with two outs in the eighth but failed to score. Delabar fell behind 3-0 on Ross but came back to strike him out, then got James Loney to pop up to end the threat.	Boston also stranded runners at the corners in the fourth and left a runner at third in the seventh.	The Blue Jays took the lead with a two-out rally in the first. Edwin Encarnacion walked, went to third on Adam Lind's double and scored on Yunel Escobar's single. Third base coach Brian Butterfield waved Lind home as well, but Lind was thrown out at the plate to end the inning.	Ross tied it with a leadoff homer in the second, his 21st, and the Red Sox took a 2-1 lead in the fourth on Saltalamacchia's two-out RBI single to center.	Toronto tied it again in the fifth. Anthony Gose led off with a single and stole second before Rajai Davis reached on a fielding error by Ciriaco. Both runners moved up on Brett Lawrie's sacrifice bunt and Encarnacion was walked to load the bases for Lind, who hit a sacrifice fly to shallow center, with Gose streaking home ahead of Ellsbury's throw. Ellsbury was charged with an error when the ball bounced away from Saltalamacchia, allowing the runners to move up, but Red Sox starter Clay Buchholz escaped by getting Escobar to ground out.	Buchholz failed to extend his six-start winning streak at Rogers Centre, giving up two runs, one earned, and four hits in seven innings. He walked five, one intentional, and struck out five.	"He threw the ball exceptionally well," Valentine said. "Good fastball down, really good curveball today and split."	Buchholz, who had lost three of his previous four starts, was encouraged by the strong outing.	"It feels good," he said. "It's a shame it didn't happen at the beginning of the season when I wanted it to, or expected it to."	Toronto's Carlos Villanueva, who had won just once in his previous eight starts, didn't figure in the decision but was sharp in this one, matching his longest start of the season by allowing two runs and four hits in seven-plus innings. He walked two and struck out six.	"He's been very consistent," Blue Jays manager John Farrell said. "On the days he starts for us, he's dependable. We know what we're going to get from Carlos and that's typically four pitches for strikes and keeping the game in control and he did it again today."	Game notes	 2B Dustin Pedroia returned to Boston's lineup after missing the past two games. Pedroia left after six innings Wednesday when his wife went into labor with the couple's second son, Cole. ... Of Ross's 21 homers this season, 11 have either tied the score of given Boston the lead. ... Valentine said he would like to add an extra outfielder once International League champions Pawtucket finish their season with Tuesday's Triple-A championship game against the Pacific Coast league winners.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Francisco Liriano is a difficult pitcher to figure out.	When the Chicago White Sox pitcher is throwing strikes, his changeup-slider combination makes him a lefty who can dominate lineups. But when he is can't find the plate, it is often only a matter of time until the opposition scores runs in bunches.	That inconsistency was part of the reason Liriano was traded from Minnesota to the White Sox at the end of July.	But in Saturday's 5-3 victory over the Twins, Liriano (6-11) was tremendous against his former team. Instead of being wild and getting frustrated, Liriano took a no-hitter into the seventh inning and helped the White Sox stay on top of the AL Central.	Considering Liriano had recently been demoted to the bullpen -- making him a rare pitcher who made the rotation-to-reliever move for two teams in the same season -- this performance came as a huge surprise.	"He just looked like he had a lot of confidence out there, just throwing strikes," White Sox manager Robin Ventura said. "His stuff moves all over the place. When he has that confidence and pounds the strike zone, he's tough."	Liriano allowed only a two-out homer in the seventh to Trevor Plouffe. He walked two, hit a batter and struck out nine in seven innings.	"He seemed like he was more under control, he wasn't as jumpy, he wasn't as quick," Chicago catcher A.J. Pierzynski said. "It looked like he slowed it down a little bit. He pitched really well. I was happy for him to come back here and do that. He had a great slider and a great changeup."	Liriano, who threw a no-hitter against the White Sox last season, was simply relieved to help Chicago win and stay ahead of Detroit in the AL Central race.	"My last three starts, I didn't feel like I did my job, but you've got to keep fighting," said Liriano, who picked up his third win since the July 28 trade. "Today I felt like I did my job."	Ventura would not commit to having Liriano rejoin the White Sox rotation for the final 17 games of the regular season and starting Thursday at Kansas City, but said that the performance was "a great step for him."	Liriano didn't appear too concerned about what his role is down the stretch.	"It's not a big deal," he said. "We're in a pennant race now, we've got to stay focused and do whatever's best for the team, whether bullpen or starting."	Liriano never got in serious trouble against the Twins. He allowed only two runners through the first six innings. He walked Josh Willingham with two outs in the first inning, but quickly got the next batter, Justin Morneau, to ground out. Liriano walked Drew Butera to lead off the bottom of the sixth and then got Pedro Florimon to ground into a double play.	Liriano's bid for the no-hitter ended with two outs in the seventh. After hitting Morneau with a pitch, Plouffe blasted a high changeup over the wall in left-center on Liriano's 96th pitch of the game.	"I had better location with pitches and I was getting ahead in the count early and they were swinging early," said Liriano who opened this season by losing seven of his first nine starts. "Pitching's all about location, if you get better location, you'll get better results."	The Twins had seen enough flashes of brilliance from Liriano since 2006 that they weren't shocked.	"We've all seen him dominate teams, just dominate them," Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said. "But we've also seen where has a hard time finding the strike zone. Anything Frankie does we've seen it one way or another."	Jesse Crain, another former Twins player, pitched a perfect eighth inning for the White Sox.	Closer Addison Reed faced three batters to start the bottom of the ninth, but didn't record an out. With the bases loaded, White Sox manager Robin Ventura then turned to Matt Thornton to finish the game.	Thornton got Morneau to ground into a run-scoring double play and Plouffe to ground out to pick up his third save in seven chances.	Paul Konerko homered in the third inning and drove in the first three runs of the game as the White Sox jumped ahead 4-0. Slugger Adam Dunn returned to the White Sox lineup for the first time since straining a muscle on his right side more than a week ago. Dunn, who missed seven games, went 2 for 3 with a walk and scored a run before being lifted for a pinch-runner in the top of the eighth.	"It felt fine," Dunn said. "I didn't try to swing as hard as I could, it felt good."	Minnesota starter Samuel Deduno (6-4) struggled with his control from the start, throwing only 40 of his 86 pitches for strikes. Deduno, who had been undefeated at Target Field, lasted just four innings, giving up four runs on three hits with five walks and six strikeouts.	Game notes	 RHP Jake Peavy (10-11, 3.27 ERA) will try to even his record Sunday in his 29th start of the season for the White Sox. The Twins will counter with Scott Diamond (11-7, 3.46 ERA), who has lost two of his last three starts. ... Minnesota catcher Joe Mauer missed his fifth straight game due to back spasms. ... Minnesota's Ryan Doumit wasn't in the lineup, but was available to pinch hit if needed. ... The seven innings pitched was Liriano's longest since the trade to Chicago and matched his second longest of the season.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

CLEVELAND --  Anibal Sanchez thought he could pitch a no-hitter and Alex Avila believed he touched third base.	Turns out, neither did as the Detroit Tigers beat the Cleveland Indians 5-3 despite having a run taken off the scoreboard Saturday.	Carlos Santana ruined Sanchez's no-hit bid with a two-out triple in the seventh, but Cleveland was officially eliminated from the playoffs after falling to 16-45 since the All-Star break.	"I thought I would do it," Sanchez (3-5) said of throwing his second career no-hitter. "I was trying to be aggressive, not be afraid and all my pitches were working."	Sanchez struck out seven over 6 2/3 innings as Detroit stayed one game behind the first place Chicago White Sox in the AL Central with its fourth straight win.	Ironically, the White Sox also won 5-3 as Chicago starter Francisco Liriano had a no-hitter for 6 2/3 innings against Minnesota.	"It is what it is," Tigers manager Jim Leyland said. "We're still playing for pretty big stakes, just as they are."	After Cleveland rallied, Jose Valverde, the fourth Tigers pitcher, worked the ninth for his 31st save in 35 chances.	Leyland said the win was bigger than Sanchez's bid for history and that he went to the bullpen to help the right-hander get only his second victory in seven starts since Aug. 8.	"You can't get sentimental, well maybe if you've got a 15-run lead," Leyland said. "He was throwing great, got two quick outs in the seventh, then they got a couple runs."	Detroit got only one run instead of two in the fifth for a 4-0 lead when Avila missed third.	With two outs, and Avila on second after an RBI double off Justin Masterson (11-14), Quintin Berry hit a ball into the hole at shortstop, where Asdrubal Cabrera fielded it and threw to third to try and get Avila advancing. The wild throw sent Avila home and Berry to second.	Cleveland changed pitchers and reliever Tony Sipp stepped off the rubber and threw to third on an appeal as Berry broke for the bag in an attempted steal. Third-base umpire Wally Bell ordered Berry back, since time was still out. The appeal happened again, with Berry again running, and this time Bell signaled out and took the run off the board.	"We didn't see it right off the bat," manager Manny Acta said of Avila missing the bag as he slid in. "One of our coaches went down to watch a video and we found out through that. The pitching change gave us time to appeal the play."	Leyland said Tigers third-base coach Gene Lamont saw the Indians signal third baseman Lonnie Chisenhall during the break. So Lamont met with Berry and told him to run.	"Once he explained it, I understood and it was a very smart thing," Berry said. "But I was thinking people would be saying how stupid I was. I had a feeling Twitter was going crazy on me."	The idea was to have Berry run, hoping the Indians would tag him instead of stepping on the base. If so, that play would have happened sequentially after Avila scored. When Chisenhall stood on the bag to take the appeal throw, even though he then touched Berry, the out was recorded on Avila.	Sanchez had a perfect game until hitting Shin-Soo Choo in the leg with a pitch to open the fourth. Choo was erased on Santana's inning-ending double play.	Cleveland nearly got a hit with two outs in the sixth. No. 9 hitter Lou Marson's grounder up the middle was fielded by second baseman Omar Infante behind the bag. Infante, acquired in a July 23 deal with Sanchez from Miami, whirled and made an off-balance throw that was picked by first baseman Cecil Fielder for the out.	"Great play and that's when I really thought I had a chance," Sanchez said.	Sanchez, who was 5-7 with Miami before this year's trade, threw a no-hitter as a rookie six years ago. In his 13th career start, he struck out six in a 2-0 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Sept. 6, 2006.	Detroit scored in the first before getting a hit. Masterson walked two and struck out two before Chisenhall misplayed a grounder that gave Detroit a 1-0 lead. Avila then hit an RBI single.	Two singles and a sacrifice fly by Austin Jackson made it 3-0 in the fourth.	Miguel Cabrera hit his 37th homer leading off the seventh for a 5-0 lead.	Following Sanchez' triple, rookie Russ Canzler broke up the shutout with an RBI double and Chisenhall singled him home. Phil Coke came on and struck out pinch hitter Matt LaPorta to end the rally.	"A huge strikeout," Leyland said. "LaPorta runs into one there, we're in trouble."	Asdrubal Cabrera made it 5-3 with an RBI single in the eighth, after striking out three times in his first game since missing four with a sore right wrist.	Game notes	 Both teams said it was tough to see because of shadows caused by the 4:05 p.m., start. Cleveland struck out 13 Tigers; Detroit pitchers had 10 strikeouts. ... Leyland, on a one-year contract, says he hasn't given thought about where he will be in 2013. "I'm thinking about how to beat the Cleveland Indians," Leyland said before the game. "That will all take care of itself. There's no sense asking about it because I don't want to talk about me. We're in a pennant race. I don't want to be a distraction." ... Indians rookie RHP Cody Allen struck out all five batters he faced in relief. ... X-rays were negative on Indians INF Jason Donald's right wrist. He was hit by a pitch from Detroit ace RHP Justin Verlander on Friday night. ... Tigers OF Delmon Young didn't start. He struck out as a pinch hitter with the bases loaded in the seventh, extending his slump to 5 for 30.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

NEW YORK --  Some critical reinforcements are still on the way for the Yankees. With the AL East race up for grabs, New York would be thrilled if those players are as sharp as Ivan Nova when they get back.	Nova was downright nasty in his return from a shoulder injury and New York got back-to-back home runs from Curtis Granderson and Eduardo Nunez in a 5-3 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays on Saturday.	"Even though he hadn't pitched a lot, you could see where his endurance level was, where his velocity was, the deception on his pitches," Granderson said. "He did an excellent job for us."	Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez each had an RBI single for the Yankees, who began the day tied with Baltimore atop the division standings. The Orioles later lost 5-2 in Oakland.	Evan Longoria homered for the third-place Rays, who fell four games behind New York with 17 to play.	"We don't have a lot of time," Longoria said.	One day after Yankees ace CC Sabathia lost his third straight decision, Nova outpitched James Shields and gave New York's rotation a nice boost. David Robertson worked a perfect eighth and Rafael Soriano got three outs for his 39th save in 42 attempts.	With two on in the ninth, Soriano fanned pinch-hitter Elliot Johnson for the final out -- assuring the Yankees (82-63) their 20th consecutive winning season.	Asked what he liked about Nova's performance, Yankees manager Joe Girardi replied: "Everything."	"We've seen him do it before. We really didn't expect to get him into the seventh," Girardi said. "I was extremely impressed with his stuff today and his command and what he did out there."	Nova (12-7) missed a little more than three weeks with inflammation in his right rotator cuff. Making his first start since Aug. 21, he was charged with two runs and four hits in six-plus innings.	"He's good, man," Tampa Bay's Carlos Pena said. "That's one of the best curveballs in the game right now."	Nova struck out eight and walked two, improving to 5-1 in eight career starts against the Rays with his second win overall since the All-Star break.	"I was just hoping that coming off of whatever was bothering him, it would continue to be a problem, and it was not," Rays manager Joe Maddon said. "He likes our uniform, I know that. He's very comfortable when he sees our uniform."	The 25-year-old right-hander was lifted after Jeff Keppinger's leadoff single in the seventh on his 85th pitch. He pointed toward the stands, tapped his chest and doffed his cap as he walked off the field to a grateful ovation from the crowd of 46,856.	Joba Chamberlain gave up a two-run single to pinch-hitter Luke Scott before striking out Desmond Jennings to preserve a 4-3 lead. Jennings whiffed three times in the leadoff spot.	"I was getting crazy the last couple of days because I didn't pitch," Nova said. "I was waiting for this moment."	Nova's fine outing marked the latest of what the Yankees hope will be several helpful September additions.	Rodriguez came back Sept. 3 from a broken hand and Andy Pettitte is set to pitch Tuesday against Toronto in his return from a broken ankle that's sidelined him since June 28. First baseman Mark Teixeira is trying to recover from a calf injury, but he's still sore and there's no timetable for him to get back in the batting cage, Girardi said.	Even speedy outfielder Brett Gardner (elbow surgery) is getting close to coming off the disabled list, if only to provide a potential pinch-runner.	Rodriguez added an RBI single in the eighth off Jake McGee after center fielder B.J. Upton misplayed Robinson Cano's deep liner into a double. Before that, McGee had retired 22 consecutive batters, 13 on strikeouts.	Raul Ibanez drew a leadoff walk in the second and Granderson sent his 39th homer into the lower seats in right field. Prior to that swing, Granderson was 6 for 56 (.107) against Shields.	Nunez, who made a costly error at shortstop late in Friday night's 6-4 loss to the Rays, followed with a long drive to left for his first major league homer since Sept. 21 last season -- also off Shields. That made Nunez 7 for 14 with two home runs against the right-hander.	Girardi gave Nunez a little pep talk after his error.	"He does some amazing things," said Granderson, who called Nunez one of the fastest players in the league. "The things that he can do right now, he's one of those valuable assets that we definitely need."	Coming off a two-hit shutout Sunday against Texas, Shields (14-9) allowed four runs and six hits in 6 1/3 innings. "Big Game James" has been anything but that at Yankee Stadium, where he is 0-6 in his last seven starts.	Maddon, however, said his hitters need to help. He likened Tampa Bay's recurring woes on offense to a country-western song.	"Between your dog and your pick-up, we came up short again," he said.	Game notes	 Longoria (hamstring) was the DH again for Tampa Bay. Keppinger started at 3B. ... Shields was 6-1 with a 2.22 ERA in his previous seven decisions. The right-hander dropped to 2-9 in 12 career starts at Yankee Stadium. He is 7-14 in 26 starts against New York. ... Rodriguez singled for his 2,885th hit, passing Zack Wheat for sole possession of 37th place on the career list. ... Girardi rested OF-1B Nick Swisher and C Russell Martin. Both have struggled against Shields. Eric Chavez started at first base. ... New York Rangers defenseman Ryan McDonagh joined the Bleacher Creatures for "roll call," the Yankees said.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

ATLANTA --  Freddie Freeman insists the NL East race is far from over.	The Atlanta Braves are 6½ games out of the division lead with 16 games to play, but Freeman believes they still have a good chance to catch the Washington Nationals.	"I mean have they won the division yet?" Freeman said. "No, they haven't, so obviously we do."	Pinch-runner Jeff Baker scored the go-ahead run in the eighth inning when reliever Ryan Mattheus hit Andrelton Simmons' uniform with a bases-loaded pitch that helped Atlanta beat the Nationals 5-4 on Saturday.	Jason Heyward and Freeman homered for the Braves, who have won the first two games in the series and nine of 13.	The Braves beat Washington 2-1 on Friday when Simmons scored on a throwing error in the ninth inning.	Atlanta began the day with a seven-game lead over third-place Los Angeles in the NL wild-card race, but Heyward said the team's focus is on passing the Nationals in the standings.	"I feel like the last two times we've played them we've done better," Heyward said. "We've taken strides and just tried to hang in there and keep battling."	Braves closer Craig Kimbrel earned his 36th save in 39 ties after striking out the side. After pinch-runner Eury Perez stole second and made it to third on catcher J.C. Boscan's throwing error, Kimbrel struck out Steve Lombardozzi and pinch-hitter Tyler Moore to end it.	Eric O'Flaherty (3-0) faced the minimum in the eighth for Atlanta, extending his scoreless innings streak to 19 1/3 innings, a span of 22 games.	Mattheus (5-2) allowed one hit, one run, two walks and no strikeouts.	With the game tied 4-4 in the eighth, David Ross led off the eighth with a single off Mattheus and moved to second one out later when Dan Uggla walked. Baker pinch-ran for Ross before Chipper Jones walked to load the bases.	Mattheus hit Simmons' uniform to give Simmons an RBI when Baker scored to make it 5-4.	"I just couldn't fine the (strike) zone," Mattheus said. "I just couldn't throw strikes. That's inexcusable. I didn't give us a chance to win that game."	Nationals manager Davey Johnson was ejected for the first time this season for arguing what appeared to be a blown call in the sixth that led to Atlanta scoring two runs to make it 4-all.	Washington starting pitcher Edwin Jackson knocked down Martin Prado's liner, picked up the ball off the mound and threw to first baseman Adam LaRoche.	First-base umpire Marvin Hudson ruled that Jackson's throw pulled LaRoche right foot off the bag, but television replays showed that likely wasn't the case and that Prado should've been called out.	Johnson was upset that Hudson refused to ask another umpire for help in making sure the call was correct.	"I've got old eyes and I could see it," Johnson said. "I thought he overreacted. He wasn't going to get any help. It was a big run."	Jackson was charged with a throwing error on the play, and Heyward, the next batter, made it 4-all with his 27th homer, a two-run shot.	Jackson gave up four hits and four runs -- three earned -- with one walk and seven strikeouts in 5 1/3 innings.	LaRoche hit his 30th homer, a two-run shot off Tommy Hanson, to make it 2-0 in the first.	The Nationals went up 4-0 in the second on two errors by the Braves.	After Jesus Flores walked with one out, Lombardozzi reached when Freeman fielded his grounder near first, juggled the ball while considering a throw to second and was late getting to the bag.	Jackson followed with a bunt single that Hanson fielded in front of the mound. Hanson threw errantly to first and allowed both runners to score.	In the bottom of the third, Uggla made it 4-1 with an RBI double.	Freeman's 20th homer, a solo shot in the fourth, cut the lead to 4-2. Freeman tripled in the third and singled in the sixth.	"(Washington) is the No. 1 team in the National League," Freeman said. "We're playing them tough. We've beaten them twice now, so we've got a chance to sweep them tomorrow."	Hanson, who is winless in his last six starts, allowed four hits and four runs -- two earned -- with one walk and seven strikeouts in five innings.	Jonny Venters pitched the next 1 2/3 innings for Atlanta. Peter Moylan relieved him with pinch-runner Roger Bernadina at first. Moylan gave up a single to Jayson Werth that advanced Bernadina to third.	Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez brought in Luis Avilan, who ended the threat with one pitch when Freeman fielded Bryce Harper's grounder and threw to second for the forceout.	Tom Gorzelanny got the final two outs of the sixth for Washington. Christian Garcia retired two batters in the seventh, but had runners on first and third when Mike Gonzalez entered and struck out Heyward.	"This team has had success against us over the past few years, regardless of where they've been in the standings," Heyward said. "This year is no different."	Game notes	 Jones entered as a pinch-hitter for 3B Juan Francisco in the sixth and stayed in the game, going 0 for 1 with a walk. ... The official scoring was changed after the game regarding Jackson's bunt single in the second. The play was initially ruled a sacrifice bunt. ... The Braves activated RHP Ben Sheets from the 15-day disabled list before the game. Sheets, 34, will pitch out of the bullpen for the first time in his 10-year career. ... Ross replaced Brian McCann as the Atlanta catcher before the top of the third and threw out Lombardozzi trying to steal second in the fourth. McCann left with tendinitis in his right hamstring. ... Nationals LHP Gio Gonzalez will go for his 20th victory on Sunday. LHP Mike Minor pitches for Atlanta. ... The Braves won just their third series in their last 14 with Washington.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

HOUSTON --  Sitting on 99 losses, the Houston Astros had reason to blare the celebration music in the postgame clubhouse on Saturday night.	Lifted by an early lead and a strong start by Dallas Keuchel, Houston blanked the Philadelphia Phillies 5-0 to temporarily avoid a second consecutive 100-loss season.	Justin Maxwell hit a two-run home run, and Keuchel pitched 5 1/3 scoreless innings -- allowing five hits and four walks -- for his first win in nearly three months, as the Astros beat Philadelphia for the second time in three games.	The Phillies were slowed in their surge for an NL playoff spot for the second time in three games by the worst team in the big leagues. Philadelphia entered the day three games behind St. Louis for the final wild-card spot. The Cardinals played the Dodgers later Saturday.	Keuchel (2-7) admitted to being aware of the looming milestone loss but said it didn't affect his performance.	"Actually, I don't normally pay attention to the wins and losses, but I looked before the game and saw that we had 99 losses," Keuchel said. "But it's nothing I worry about. I just try to do my job and help the team win."	It was Keuchel's first win in 11 starts, since his previous victory on June 23 against Cleveland.	"I'm real happy for Keuchel," Astros manager Tony DeFrancesco said. "He battled out of a couple of tough jams, and I wanted to make sure the kid got a win when he came out. I'm real proud of him."	Keuchel struggled with location early, walking two in the first inning as the Phillies loaded the bases. But Keuchel got Ty Wigginton to fly out to end the threat, and Philadelphia stranded eight baserunners through the first four innings.	"The first inning for him has been a problem so far," DeFrancesco said. "If we can get him confident from when he comes out of the bullpen to when he crosses the line, he can do well."	Keuchel escaped another bases-loaded jam in the fourth inning to frustrate the Phillies.	"He made pitches when he needed to," Phillies catcher Erik Kratz said.	In addition to raising Keuchel's confidence, DeFrancesco said he believed victories against teams competing for a spot in the playoffs  can bring a much needed morale boost.	"Today was the day where they all believed in themselves," DeFrancesco said. "Tomorrow is another day. If we can be the spoiler and give our guys some success and confidence, that's what we're looking for."	After Keuchel's exit in the sixth, the Houston bullpen held on for the Astros' largest margin of victory in more than a month. The Phillies finished with seven hits and 12 runners left on base.	Houston reliever Mickey Storey made his first appearance since taking a line drive to the jaw area in Wednesday's 5-1 loss to Chicago. Storey struck out the only two batters he faced, improving his opponent's batting average to .179 in 19 appearances this season.	"If there's an unsung hero in that bullpen, I think it has to be Mickey Storey," DeFrancesco said.	The Houston bullpen has posted a 3.27 ERA in 52 1/3 innings in September, helping the Astros to a 7-7 record this month.	Wesley Wright allowed one hit to Kevin Frandsen with two outs in the ninth inning before getting Chase Utley to ground out to end the game.	"They had chances, but we made pitches," DeFrancesco said. "The ball went our way today."	Kyle Kendrick (9-11) struggled early and was done after just five innings, his shortest outing in more than a month. He gave up four runs on seven hits, including a Maxwell's homer in the first inning. It was Maxwell's 16th home run of the season. Jose Altuve led off the inning with a single.	The Phillies blew a 4-0 lead in Friday's 6-4 loss to Houston (47-99) to open the four-game series, a loss that snapped a seven-game winning streak.	Altuve, Brett Wallace and J.D. Martinez added RBIs for the Astros, whose 34-23 record against Philadelphia since 2004 is tops in the NL.	Altuve drove in Matt Dominguez in the second to make it 3-0 Astros. Wallace drove in a run with a ground-rule double in the fifth inning.	Game notes	 Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said he plans to start C Carlos Ruiz every other game beginning Sunday. Ruiz, who pinch-hit Saturday, continues to recover from plantar fasciitis in his left foot, which landed him in the DL last month.  .  Astros infielder Tyler Greene will start at 2B on Sunday as manager Tony DeFrancesco gives Altuve some much-needed rest. ... SS Jimmy Rollins stole two bases, giving him 29 for the season, including a major league-leading 12 steals of third base.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Zack Greinke threw 109 pitches in holding the Kansas Royals scoreless for 8 1/3 innings.	Ernesto Frieri then needed just four pitches to ruin Greinke's spectacular outing and hurt the Los Angeles Angels' playoff hopes.	Billy Butler hit a two-run homer and Salvador Perez followed with the game-winner as the Royals rallied to hand the Los Angeles Angels a stunning 3-2 loss on Saturday night.	Frieri (3-1) replaced Greinke with one out in the ninth after Alex Gordon singled. Butler homered to center on Frieri's first pitch to tie it. Three pitches later, Perez hit a flyball off the left-field pole for his first career walkoff homer.	"This ballpark can play funny sometimes," Butler said. "I knew that one was gone. We knew we were looking for a fastball. I told Sal on deck, `You'd better not be late' and neither of us was late."	All Greinke could do was watch the dramatic turn of events.	"It was pretty amazing," Greinke said. "I don't think I've ever seen back-to-back homers to walk off like that. I don't know if it's ever happened. You don't see that I think ever.	"It's part of baseball," Greinke added. "Ernie's got a great fastball. Butler is a good fastball hitter. Yesterday he got it by them. He threw his best pitch to both of those guys and it just didn't work out."	Greinke gave up just five singles, walked two and struck out three in 8 1/3 innings. He has allowed seven runs and 24 hits in 37 innings for a 1.70 ERA in his past five starts.	Greinke, who has thrown up to 118 pitches in a game this year and at least 103 pitches in all 10 of his Angels starts, said he could have finished.	"Yeah, but I mean I'm not going to second guess," Greinke said. "I think he's (Mike Scioscia) probably the best manager in baseball at least from the outside looking in and so far being here. He's smarter than me."	Greinke has not pitched a complete game since 2009 when he won the American League Cy Young Award while with the Royals.	"We were getting to that point where I wanted to give them a different look," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said on pulling Greinke. "Obviously it didn't work. Zack was getting near 110 pitches. Ernie just hit a couple of bats with fastballs. He left them up, middle in and those guys didn't miss them."	The Angels entered the day 2½ games back of Baltimore and New York for the second wild-card spot in the AL	"Anytime you lose a game late it's a heavier page to turn, but we have to come out tomorrow," Scioscia said. "We're at the point in the season where everything changes, inning to inning, pitch to pitch."	Kendrys Morales, who homered for the second straight game, hit an 0-1 pitch from Jeremy Guthrie to right leading off the Angels' fifth for the first run.	Guthrie, who was 4-0 with a 1.70 ERA in his previous seven starts, faced the minimum number of batters the first four innings. He gave up a fourth inning leadoff single to Mike Trout, but picked him off first. Guthrie left after eight innings, allowing two runs on five hits.	"I thought early my fastball was good," Guthrie said. "I left a fastball up to Morales, but I got some groundballs and we played good defense. The majority of your games are against tough lineups. When you go up against that you anticipate a dog fight."	Kelvin Herrera (3-3) replaced Guthrie and picked up the win with a scoreless ninth.	Greinke, who was acquired from Milwaukee in a trade on July 27 trade, pitched out of a first inning jam.	Alcides Escobar, who had two of the hits off Greinke, singled with one out to extend his hitting streak to a career-high 11 games. Escobar advanced to third on Gordon's groundball single to right.	Escobar was out at the plate when he attempted to score on Butler's grounder to third baseman Alberto Callaspo. Perez's grounder to Callaspo ended the inning and threat.	The Angels added a run in the eighth, when Vernon Wells led off with a single and advanced to third on two groundball outs. After Trout walked, Torii Hunter laced a run-scoring single to right that Francoeur apparently lost in the lights as it glanced off the heel of his glove. Hunter leads the American League with a .349 average since the All-Star break and has 16 RBIs in his past 17 games.	Game notes	 RHP Ervin Santana might be pushed back a few days in the Angels rotation after being struck in the arm by Josh Donaldson's liner in Wednesday's start against Oakland. "Ervin just got smoked on the forearm," Scioscia said. "We might take a couple of days with him. Ervin's going to get the ball; he's going to pitch. It's set him back a little bit as to when he's going to throw his `pen. He'll throw a couple of light things. He'll probably throw this weekend and then we'll see where he is." . Royals 2B Johnny Giavotella committed two errors. The Royals had committed just five errors in their previous 18 games. .This series closes Sunday with the Royals starting rookie LHP Will Smith, who pitched seven scoreless innings Tuesday in a victory at Minnesota. RHP Dan Haren will start for the Angels.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MILWAUKEE --  Rickie Weeks continued his torrid hitting and kept the Brewers in the hunt for an NL wild-card spot.	Weeks hit a two-run homer to cap a five-run fourth inning and lift the Brewers to a 9-6 win over the New York Mets on Saturday night.	Trailing 4-1 in the fourth the Brewers rallied for five runs to win for the 19th time in 25 games. Milwaukee leaped ahead of Philadelphia in the race for the second NL wild-card spot but remained behind St. Louis, Los Angeles and Pittsburgh.	"It's just one of those things where we need some help, obviously," Weeks said. "But at the same time we want to get this thing done."	Weeks struggled the first three months of the season, and didn't get his batting average permanently over .200 until July 25. He's been hot lately, batting .343 with seven home runs and 14 RBI in his last 16 games to raise his average to .230.	"I've been swinging the bat pretty well for more than a couple of weeks," Weeks said. "I just keep coming back to the ballpark and working hard. That's all you can do."	The Mets lost for the ninth time in 11 games.	Weeks' homer capped the inning and was his 20th of the season. He also had a double, scored two runs and drove in three. Reliever Brandon Kintzler (2-0) pitched a scoreless fifth to get credit for the victory.	Jenrry Mejia (0-1) pitched three innings in his first major-league start exactly two years after making his last start. He underwent ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction surgery in May 2011.	"His command was off," New York manager Terry Collins said of Mejia. "That's going to be something we certainly have to make sure is first and foremost. It's tough to pitch up here behind in the count."	Mejia, who made his major-league debut in 2010 at the age of 20, had control problems, walking five batters and throwing strikes in just 32 of his 68 pitches. He gave up five runs on six hits and five walks and was removed by manager Terry Collins after the first four Brewers reached base in the fourth inning.	Daniel Murphy had a double and two singles for New York. Ike Davis hit a two-run homer, his 27th, in the ninth for the Mets.	With the Mets leading 4-1, Mejia walked Nyjer Morgan to open the fourth and Jean Segura reached on a bunt single. Pinch-hitter Logan Schafer lined a triple down the right field line to score both runners and bring the Brewers within 4-3.	Mejia then walked Aoki and was removed for Jeremy Hefner. The right-hander's second pitch to Weeks bounced in front of the plate and got past catcher Kelly Shoppach for a wild pitch, scoring Schafer from third to tie the score at 4-4.	Weeks then hit a 1-2 pitch that landed in the netting above the Brewers bullpen, giving Milwaukee a 6-4 lead.	Pinch-hitter Travis Ishikawa hit an RBI triple in the fifth to make it 7-4. Aoki followed with an RBI single to extend the lead to 8-4.	Weeks' two-out double scored Segura to make it 9-4 in the seventh.	Milwaukee starter Shaun Marcum had another ineffective outing, giving up four runs on seven hits and two walks while striking out three in just four innings. In five starts after missing 10 weeks with right elbow soreness, Marcum is 0-1 with a 5.70 ERA.	"He's just missing on his location," Milwaukee manager Ron Roenicke said. "I don't know if it's a rhythm thing with his delivery, or I don't know what it is."	The Mets scored three runs in the fourth on a squeeze bunt by Mejia to score Jordany Valdespin from third, an RBI single by Ruben Tejada and an RBI double by Murphy.	Game notes	 Mejia's last major-league start was on Sept. 15, 2010 against Pittsburgh. He underwent surgery on May 16, 2011 and had pitched in relief one other game this year. ... Milwaukee 1B Corey Hart missed his fifth consecutive game with a torn plantar fascia in his left foot, but did some running and took swings in the batting cages on Saturday. Roenicke said Hart could return on Tuesday in Pittsburgh. ... Aramis Ramirez dropped a foul popup in the sixth for an error, snapping a streak of 42 errorless games. ... The Mets used eight pitchers and the Brewers used six.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MIAMI --  A little numbness wasn't going to keep Carlos Lee out of the lineup.	Lee jammed his neck Friday night sliding headfirst into second base and colliding with Reds shortstop Wilson Valdez. He felt some numbness in his fingers so he left the game. He made the most of his return on Saturday.	Lee homered and drove in three runs, and the Miami Marlins beat the Cincinnati Reds 6-4.	"When I left here, I told the trainer I'm not day to day; I'll be ready tomorrow," said Lee, still sporting a cut on his right cheek from the collision. "I hit the ball pretty good."	Mark Buehrle (13-12) allowed four runs on seven hits over 7 2/3 innings to improve to 4-1 in his past six starts. Jose Reyes had three hits and also drove in a run for Miami.	"Fortunately, we scored some runs early and I just tried to go out there and keep them off base," Buehrle said.	Johnny Cueto (17-9) suffered his third straight loss and failed to last five innings for the second straight start. Cueto gave up six runs on nine hits in 4 1/3 innings, and hasn't won since August 28 at Arizona. Ryan Ludwick homered for the Reds.	"He lost location. He was wild high, missing away," Reds manager Dusty Baker said. "And when he came in throwing strikes, it was middle of the plate, belt high. Those are the ones that hurt him."	The Marlins chased Cueto with a three-run fifth, capped by a two-run homer by Lee, who hit a 3-1 pitch over the center field scoreboard that gave Miami a 6-2 lead. The homer followed Reyes' double that scored Justin Ruggiano.	"It was one bad pitch," Cueto said. "It's part of the game."	The Reds made it 6-4 on Ludwick's two-run homer off Buehrle in the eighth. Buehrle was then replaced by Mike Dunn. Steve Cishek pitched a scoreless ninth for his 14th save in 18 opportunities.	Trailing 3-0, the Reds closed to 3-1 when Valdez singled in Ryan Hanigan in the third. Cincinnati picked up another run in the fourth after Jay Bruce tripled, then scored on a single by Scott Rolen to make it 3-2. It was Bruce's first hit in 18 at-bats.	The Marlins jumped on Cueto for three runs in the first inning. After Ruggiano and Reyes hit consecutive one-out singles, Giancarlo Stanton drove in both with a triple. Lee then drove in Stanton with a sacrifice fly.	"I think we did a good job trying to make him (Cueto) throw the ball over the plate and we made him work a couple innings," Marlins manager Ozzie Guillen said. "We ran the bases very well and took advantage of a couple extra bases. Obviously, Carlos' home run was huge. It gave us a little cushion."	Game notes	 Buehrle has now pitched 188 1/3 innings to close in on his quest to eclipse the 200-inning mark for the 12th straight year...Reyes has an eight-game hit streak against the Reds. ... Cincinnati rookie SS Zack Cozart, on the DL since Sept. 3 with a left oblique strain, took batting practice on Saturday. ... The Reds bullpen hasn't given up a run in 17 innings over the last five games.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

PHOENIX --  Buster Posey had a two-run home run in the fifth to help the San Francisco Giants beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 3-2 on Saturday night.	Barry Zito scattered six hits and one run over 6 2/3 innings for the Giants, who have won four straight and 22 of their past 32. Zito (12-8) walked one and struck out four. Sergio Romo pitched the final 1 1/3 for his 11th save.	Justin Upton hit his 14th home run for the Diamondbacks, who have scored four runs or fewer in 12 straight home games to match a franchise record.	Arizona starter Wade Miley (15-10) allowed three runs on eight hits and a walk over seven innings.	Posey broke a 1-all tie in the fifth with a two-out home run two rows deep into the right-field stands. The All-Star catcher is hitting .390 in 55 games since the All-Star break with 12 homers and 49 RBIs.	Zito's outing was his longest since an eight-inning stint on August 23. He gave way to Santiago Casilla after surrendering a two-out ground rule double to left by John McDonald.	The Diamondbacks cut the lead to 3-2 in the bottom of the eighth. Aaron Hill walked, went to second on a ground out and scored on Paul Goldschmidt's single off Romo, the Giants' third pitcher of the inning.	San Francisco took a 1-0 lead two batters into the game when Angel Pagan tripled off the wall in left-center field and scored on a grounder to short by Marco Scutaro.	Upton tied the game in the bottom of the fourth with a solo shot to left-center field, his first homer in eight days and only his fifth against left-handed pitching this season.	Miley pitched into trouble in the fourth, loading the bases with a two-out walk to Hunter Pence, but retired Joaquin Arias on a fly ball to right to end the inning.	Game notes	 Miley threw 116 pitches, the third time he has reached that mark this season. In both previous games, he earned the victory. ... Pagan's first-inning triple was his 13th of the season, a new San Francisco Giants' record. Willie Mays holds the franchise's overall mark with 20 triples in 1957. ... Goldschmidt was caught stealing in the fourth for only the third time in 19 attempts. ... Arizona OF Tyler Graham made his major league debut in the ninth when he pinch ran for Miguel Montero. Two pitches later, Posey threw him out trying to steal second with a throw from his knees. ... The Diamondbacks opened the retractable roof mid-game for the second time this season and first since a May 13 contest against the Giants. . RHP Ryan Vogelsong (12-8) will take the mound for the Giants in Sunday's series finale against Diamondbacks LHP Patrick Corbin (5-7). Vogelsong is 2/3 in his past six starts and has allowed 28 runs on 43 hits in 26 1/3 innings for a 9.57 ERA. Corbin also has struggled of late, posting an 0-3 record and 6.00 ERA in his past four starts. ... The Diamondbacks staged their first-ever alumni contest after the game.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

SAN DIEGO --  The San Diego Padres believe they have a special talent in Casey Kelly.	The rookie pitcher showed on Saturday night why the Padres insisted on him being included in the Adrian Gonzalez trade with Boston in 2010.	Kelly carried a shutout into the seventh inning and Jesus Guzman hit a three-run homer, leading the Padres to a 4-3 win over the Colorado Rockies.	Kelly (2-1), making his fourth major league start, kept the Rockies off balance with a mixture of fastballs and curveballs. Colorado advanced just one runner to third base against Kelly through six innings.	"You get more and more comfortable every time out there," Kelly said. "Every inning you get you feel more comfortable with the team. I think every outing is just getting more and more comfortable."	Kelly looked more like the pitcher who allowed just three hits in six scoreless inning of his major-league debut, a 3-0 win over Atlanta on Aug. 27. In his next two outings, Kelly was hammered for 13 runs -- 11 earned -- on 16 hits over just eight innings.	"He had a terrific breaking ball early," Rockies manager Jim Tracy said. "On his two-strike pitches, he did a great job of making them strikes out of his hand."	Colorado finally reached the rookie for three runs in the seventh.	Kelly allowed three runs -- two earned -- on seven hits over six-plus innings. He struck out six.	"The velocity came back today, a lot of pitches in the low 90s," Padres manager Bud Black said. "The ball had carry and he got his grounders and he got his strikeouts. "He was very efficient."	Luke Gregerson pitched a perfect ninth for his eighth save in 12 chances.	Rookie Drew Pomeranz (1-9) dropped his sixth straight decision for Colorado, which lost for the eighth time in its last 10 games.	The Rockies need to win 10 of their last 18 games to avoid tying the franchise's worst record at 67-95.	San Diego has won eight of 10 overall and 12 of 15 at Petco Park.	Guzman homered to center in the third inning off Pomeranz to give San Diego a 4-0 lead.	"A home run ball that was outside," Pomeranz said. "Sometimes it happens that way. It wasn't a bad pitch. It wasn't even in the strike zone. I don't know how he hit it so far."	Padres shortstop Andy Parrino committed a fielding error and Tyler Colvin followed with a single to start the Rockies' seventh.	Chris Nelson then doubled in one run and Charlie Blackmon had an RBI single to knock Kelly out of the game. Brad Brach came in and gave up DJ LeMahieu's sacrifice fly to cut the lead to 4-3 before getting the final two outs.	Pomeranz was pulled after three innings with his pitch count at 67. The rookie allowed four runs on four hits with three strikeouts, two walks and a wild pitch. The Rockies have employed a 75-pitch limit on their starters since just past mid-June.	San Diego scored in the second inning after a scary collision between second baseman LeMahieu and right fielder Blackmon.	With Cameron Maybin on first with a two-out single, Parrino hit a popup into shallow right field. As LeMahieu and Blackmon converged to make the catch, they rammed their shoulders full force into each other. Blackmon fell to the grass, but LeMahieu stayed on his feet and got the ball into the infield as Parrino ended up with a double.	Game notes	 Pomeranz has failed to finish five innings in eight of his last nine starts. ... The Padres honored longtime broadcaster Jerry Coleman with a bronze statue at Petco Park before Saturday night's game. ... There was a large star cut into the center-field grass in honor of one of Coleman's catch phrases, "You can hang a star on that." ... Rockies manager Jim Tracy said his team will modify the current 75-pitch limit on starting pitchers next season. The Rockies will move the limit to between 75 and 90-100 pitches. ... Jordan Pacheco will start his second game at catcher on Sunday for Colorado. Pacheco has started 104 previous games this season -- 80 at third base, 23 at first and one at catcher. ... When speaking about the 2013 season, San Diego manager Bud Black said, "The group that you're seeing here, position wise, will be the group you'll see coming back." ... Padres LF Carlos Quentin (sore right knee) has not started in four consecutive games. ... Rockies RHP Alex White (2-8, 5.18) faces Padres LHP Andrew Werner (2-1, 2.59) in the series finale on Sunday.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  The Oakland Athletics have had a different star for just about every monumental win they've had this season.	Shortstop Stephen Drew became the latest -- doing it at the plate and in the field.	Drew homered and made a pair of big defensive plays to back Jarrod Parker, and the A's beat the Baltimore Orioles 5-2 on Saturday night to pull within two games of division-leading Texas.	"It's kind of crazy how this team works sometimes," Drew said. "It's a good feeling to have, anybody, anytime. It works out well."	It definitely did against Baltimore.	Drew's home run was the first of four hits in the third inning off Baltimore starter Zach Britton and sparked a five-run outburst for Oakland. It's Drew's second home run as a member of the A's and fourth overall.	The A's shortstop then made the first of his two defensive gems when he threw out Adam Jones trying to score from first on Chris Davis' double in the fourth.	Jones reached on a leadoff infield single and Davis followed with a double down the left field line. Jones kept running as Yoenis Cespedes retrieved the ball and threw it to Drew, who turned and made the relay throw home just in time to nab Jones as he was attempting to slide past catcher Derek Norris.	"He's been a good fit for us," A's manager Bob Melvin said. "Everything has to work on a play like that. If you're a little on that play you don't get the runner, and that was a big play in the game for us not to give up a run."	Drew later ran down Endy Chavez's grounder behind second base and flipped the ball from his glove to Adam Rosales to force out Mark Reynolds.	Nate McLouth homered for Baltimore, which dropped one game behind the New York Yankees in the AL East.	"No one in this clubhouse is down," Jones said. "The last few days we've been beat. I don't think we've beaten ourselves. We just can't score enough runs."	Chris Carter had a two-run double as part of the third inning while Josh Reddick added two hits and an RBI for Oakland, which has won two straight over Baltimore to clinch the season series between the top two teams in the AL wild card race.	The A's aren't giving up on the division either.	The win, coupled with the Rangers loss to Seattle, moved Oakland within two games of Texas. It's the closest the A's have been since April 13.	They're also a season-high 23 games over .500. and have already won 10 more games than they did last year.	Parker (11-8) allowed two runs and seven hits over seven innings to win back-to-back starts for the first time since mid-July. The A's rookie right-hander struck out five, walked one and retired 11 of the final 13 batters he faced.	"Early on I was kind of battling myself a little bit and then I was able to kind of get over that and pitch better," Parker said. "They're an aggressive team and I got some early contact on some off-speed pitches and that helped out."	Sean Doolittle pitched a scoreless eighth and Grant Balfour worked the ninth for his 19th save.	Baltimore took an early 2-0 lead but couldn't make it hold up.	The Orioles managed only two hits after the fourth inning and stranded a pair of baserunners in the ninth when Balfour got Chavez to ground to third for the final out.	Parker got the Orioles to ground into a double play in the first but his error on a pickoff attempt in the second led to Baltimore's first run.	Jones singled and was leading off the bag when Parker's throw to Carter at first base went in the dirt and rolled almost to the Orioles bullpen. Jones raced to third then scored on Reynolds' double to left.	McLouth made it 2-0 with his third homer of the season, only the ninth home run allowed this season by Parker.	Britton (5-3) didn't allow a hit until the third when the A's scored five runs.	Drew's solo home run started the outburst. After Rosales grounded out, Coco Crisp walked before Britton hit Jonny Gomes on his left elbow to put runners at first and second.	Reddick and Cespedes both followed with RBI singles, and Carter doubled both men home to make it 5-2.	"The ball was running all over the place on me that inning," Britton said. "I didn't make any adjustment. I couldn't make a pitch to get out of that inning."	Britton gave up five earned runs for the second consecutive start. The left-hander had four strikeouts and four walks.	Game notes	 Baltimore has hit into five double plays in the first two games of the series. ... Rookie RHP Dan Straily (2-0) pitches for Oakland in the series finale. ... LHP Randy Wolf (2-0) makes his first start since signing with Baltimore after being released by Milwaukee in late August.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

LOS ANGELES --  Luis Cruz and the Los Angeles Dodgers are showing the kind of spunk and tenacity that hasn't been seen around Chavez Ravine for quite a while, and now the playoffs aren't such a far-fetched possibility after all. Far from it.	Cruz came up with his second clutch hit in two nights, a tying two-out RBI double in the ninth inning, and pinch-hitter Juan Rivera followed with a run-scoring single to lift the Dodgers to a 4-3 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals on Saturday night.	The Dodgers' third victory in 10 games tied them with the Cardinals for the second wild card spot with 16 remaining for both clubs. The Cardinals lost despite a homer and three RBIs by Allen Craig.	"This was pretty big. It was definitely one of our most exciting games of the season so far," center fielder Matt Kemp said. "Cruz has definitely been amazing for us. He's been hitting the ball, getting those big hits for us and doing what it takes to win. That was an all-around good team win for us."	After this four-game series concludes on Sunday, the Cards will play their next nine games against the Astros and Cubs -- who are a combined 83 games under .500 and 69½ games out of first place in the NL Central. The defending World Series champions put themselves into this precarious position by losing 13 of their last 28 games.	"We invest ourselves a lot in every game, but obviously this one stings more than others," Craig said. "It's a tough loss, but putting your head down and being overly concerned about it isn't going to get us anywhere. So we've just got to play better and stay positive. We're still in a good spot."	Jason Motte (4-5) came in trying to protect a 3-2 lead for Jaime Garcia and retired his first two batters. But Andre Ethier kept the Dodgers alive with a single and pinch-runner Dee Gordon stole second before Cruz drove him in with a drive that center fielder Jon Jay barely missed on a diving attempt in front of the warning track.	Rivera batted for A.J. Ellis and lined a single off the tip of second baseman Daniel Descalso's glove, enabling pinch-runner Elian Herrera to score the winning run. Descalso started the game at shortstop and committed two errors, one of which led to an unearned run in the first inning.	On Friday night, Cruz helped beat the Cardinals 8-5 with a go-ahead three-run homer in the sixth against Mujica.	"It's unbelievable. It's like a dream for me," Cruz said. "I'm just trying to go out there and give a hundred percent and play hard every time. I'm having the chance to come through in big situations. I'm not going to say I'm lucky, but I've been really concentrating and having good at-bats."	Ronald Belisario (6-1) pitched 1 1/3 innings for the victory. Kemp helped make it possible in the top of the ninth. He crashed into the fence trying to catch Yadier Molina's drive over his head, but recovered in time and kept him from stretching his hit into a triple with a brilliant somersaulting throw to Cruz.	"When Molina hit the ball, I didn't know how hard he hit it, but it just kept carrying," Kemp said. "I thought I might have had a play at the wall and banged into it, but I wanted to get the ball, pick it up and try to make a good throw. It turned out to be a pretty good one. That was a big out."	Kemp, whose swing hasn't been the same since he crashed into the fence at Coors Field on consecutive days (Aug. 27-28), was 0 for 4 and struck out three times in a game for the fifth time this season. He is 5 for 48 with a homer and two RBIs in his last 12 games since the Dodgers left Denver, but he is still playing with the same reckless abandon as before he got hurt.	"For me, it's all about winning," he said. "I mean, you try not to do stupid things like crashing into fences. But when I'm out there, man, I'm just trying to make a play and make things happen. I crashed into the wall, but it didn't faze me."	Dodgers starter Joe Blanton gave up three runs and four hits in 5 2/3 innings and struck out six.	A disputed call on a bang-bang play at first base enabled St. Louis to snap a 2-all tie in the sixth. Garcia drew a leadoff walk, ending a string of 13 consecutive batters retired by Blanton, and Jay followed with a single. One out later, Matt Holliday hit a potential double-play grounder to shortstop Hanley Ramirez and just beat the relay to first from second baseman Mark Ellis.	Dodgers manager Don Mattingly went out to argue with umpire Dana DeMuth, and shortly after he returned to the dugout, Craig lined a single to left on an 0-2 pitch to drive in Garcia and chase Blanton.	Blanton, who has surrendered an NL-worst 29 home runs, gave up Craig's 21st of the season in the first inning after a two-out single by Holliday.	"Blanton did a really good job of throwing all of his pitches for strikes," Craig said. "He got his fastball on the inside corner and had good command. He didn't make too many mistakes."	The Dodgers got one of the runs back in the bottom half when Shane Victorino reached on a throwing error by Descalso, stole second and scored on a two-out single by Adrian Gonzalez. Mark Ellis tied it in the third with a leadoff homer into the lower seats in the left field corner on a full count.	Before the game, the Dodgers announced that reigning NL Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw would not make his scheduled start in Sunday's series finale because of inflammation in his right hip.	Game notes	 Cardinals RF Carlos Beltran did not start because of tightness in his lower back. ... Blanton has a career record of 6-13 with nine no-decisions when allowing a home run in the first inning. ... The gametime temperature was 95 degrees, one more than Friday night. ... Craig, batting an NL-best .393 with runners in scoring position, missed the first month of the season on the disabled list while recovering from a fractured right knee cap and sat out another 14 games in May with a left hamstring strain.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

NEW YORK --  Nick Swisher drew a nice cheer for his rare bunt, Eduardo Nunez energized the crowd with three steals, and Russell Martin earned the biggest ovation for his home run.	The New York Yankees mixed and matched against Tampa Bay -- at the plate and on the mound -- and emerged with a 6-4 win Sunday that kept them ahead in the AL East and ended a most damaging road trip for the Rays.	Now, the Yankees can relax. For a bit, anyway.	"We have a day off. Guys are going to rest tomorrow," manager Joe Girardi said. "It's their last one of the year and they'd better rest because we still have a grind left."	Martin's three-run shot highlighted an eventful early burst as New York won with small ball and a longball.	The Yankees took the last two in the three-game series, and have 16 left to play. They hold a one-game division lead over Baltimore.	On Tuesday night, they host Toronto. Andy Pettitte rejoins the rotation for the first time since a batted ball broke his left leg in late June.	Minus ejected manager Joe Maddon, the Rays fell five games behind the Yankees and trail the Orioles and Los Angeles Angels in the wild-card scramble. Cleanup man Matt Joyce also was tossed as Tampa Bay finished 1-5 on its visit to Yankee Stadium and Camden Yards.	"The math isn't in our favor," Maddon said.	Then again, Tampa Ray pulled off an incredible rally last season to earn a playoff spot on the final day. This year, an extra slot is available.	"The baseball gods have created two wild cards, so let's see what happens," he said.	Ben Zobrist homered and doubled for Tampa Bay. Down 6-1, the Rays scored three times in the sixth inning and later brought the potential go-ahead run to the plate, but couldn't break through against the back end of the Yankees' bullpen.	Hiroki Kuroda (14-10) set a career high for wins, struck out 10 in six innings and beat Tampa Bay for the second time this month. Rafael Soriano, the Yankees' fifth pitcher, earned his 40th save in 43 chances.	Matt Moore (10-11) lost his fourth straight start. The rookie and Kuroda started out well in the last scheduled game between the teams, with the first nine outs overall on strikeouts. Each team finished with only five hits.	Martin's opposite-field shot to right field came during a crazy five-run third. The inning included an errant pickoff throw, a wild pitch, three walks, a pair of steals, Swisher's first sacrifice bunt of the season, warnings to both benches and Maddon's ejection.	Derek Jeter put the Yankees ahead with an RBI single, moments after playfully pointing his bat toward a young fan who was taking his picture while he was on deck, Swisher bunted and Alex Rodriguez clapped his hands after singling through the drawn-in infield for a 2-0 lead.	"Yeah, I take full credit for it," said Swisher, who had one sacrifice last year.	"In a situation right there, I felt like it needed to be done," he said. "I tried to lay it down right there, and the next thing you know, Rod comes up there -- ribbie."	Martin made it 5-0 with his 17th homer. Two batters later, Moore threw a 95 mph fastball behind the helmet of Curtis Granderson and plate umpire Paul Emmel immediately warned each side against any trouble.	Maddon jawed from the dugout, got tossed and came out for a protracted discussion with Emmel. Granderson crouched outside the batter's box during the dispute, watching the antics.	"That third inning was just atrocious," Moore said.	The wild inning seemed to wreak havoc with the scoreboard, too. As the Rays hit in the fourth, the score on the main board changed from 5-0 to 4-0 to 2-0 to 0-0, Kuroda's pitch count went in reverse and innings were wiped off.	Nunez stole twice to set up Rodriguez's sacrifice fly in the fourth for a 6-1 lead. Robinson Cano followed with a routine fly that left fielder Desmond Jennings lost in the sun for a double.	The Rays rallied in the sixth, helped by a couple of lucky bounces.	Zobrist walked after his foul pop fell out of fill-in first baseman Steve Pearce's glove at the railing, then Evan Longoria's possible double-play grounder took a bad hop over Rodriguez's shoulder at third base for a two-run single.	Game notes	 Rays RF Sam Fuld exited with a mild right hamstring strain after grounding out to end the fifth. 2B Cano bobbled the ball, recovered and threw out Fuld, who grabbed the back of his leg after crossing the bag. Maddon expects Fuld to miss at least a day or two. ... Maddon has been ejected four times this year and 27 times as Tampa Bay's manager. Bench coach Dave Martinez ran the team with Maddon gone.

TORONTO --  Jon Lester said it was the best he's thrown all year. Unfortunately for the Boston Red Sox left-hander, it ended in another loss.	Adeiny Hechavarria hit a two-run home run, Omar Vizquel had two hits, and the Toronto Blue Jays beat Lester and the Red Sox 5-0 on Sunday to avoid a three-game sweep.	Lester (9-12) gave up three runs and four hits in seven innings as the Red Sox failed to get their first three-game winning streak since posting four consecutive victories July 28-31.	"I've got to keep looking at those positives and just keep plugging away," Lester said. "Just keep working those things and try to pitch as many innings as I can every time I take the ball."	The game was scoreless until the bottom of the seventh, when Yan Gomes grounded a two-out single up the middle, just the second hit allowed by Lester.	Rajai Davis came on as a pinch runner and stole second, then scored on Vizquel's single to center. The hit was Vizquel's 2,872nd, matching him with Jesse Burkett for 42nd on the all-time list and leaving him just one behind Hall of Fame slugger Babe Ruth.	"Not even in my wildest dreams was I going to think that you can bring the name of Babe Ruth next to mine," Vizquel said.	Blue Jays manager John Farrell said he'll likely give Vizquel a chance to match Ruth's record when Toronto begins a three-game series at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday.	"I'd be crazy not to," Farrell said. "For him to tie if possible in New York will be very fitting."	Red Sox Bobby Valentine said Vizquel's hit came on Lester's only poor pitch.	"I don't know if he threw a bad pitch except for maybe the curveball to Vizquel," Valentine said. "The whole game he was in and out, doing a heck of a job."	Lester acknowledged that he was "trying to be quick to the plate" with the speedy Davis running the bases.	"As we've seen many times before, when Rajai gets on the bases he can make a lot of things happen," Farrell said.	Hechavarria hammered Lester's very next offering, a cut fastball, hooking it around the foul screen into the second deck in left for his second career home run.	"I thought that cutter was a pretty good pitch," Valentine said. "Not many guys keep that fair in the air."	Brandon Lyon (3-0) pitched 2/3 of an inning for the win. Darren Oliver worked the eighth and Casey Janssen finished as the Blue Jays recorded their ninth shutout.	Toronto pulled away with two more in the eighth off Daniel Bard. Brett Lawrie led off with a double and scored on Colby Rasmus' single to left, with Rasmus taking second on Ryan Kalish's error. Rasmus scored two batters later on Moises Sierra's RBI single off Scott Atchison.	Lester set down the first six batters in order before Vizquel doubled to begin the third, but the Blue Jays didn't get another base runner until Sierra's leadoff walk in the fifth. Sierra was safe at second when Lester threw high to second on Gomes' sacrifice bunt, then had to scamper back to the bag after nearly getting caught in a rundown.	Toronto failed to capitalize when Lester struck out Vizquel and Hechavarria, then got Anthony Gose to ground into a fielder's choice.	Boston put a runner in scoring position three times in the first four innings against Blue Jays right-hander Brandon Morrow but failed to score. The Red Sox stranded men at first and second in the first, left a runner at second in the second and stranded runners at first and second again in the fourth.	"We fired a lot of blanks with men on base today," Valentine said.	Ciriaco had a two-out single off Lyon in the seventh and stole second while Jose Iglesias was batting. When the count got to 2-2 on Iglesias, Valentine brought Daniel Nava on as a pinch hitter. Nava grounded back to the mound on the first pitch.	"Just trying to get a run for Jon, obviously," Valentine said. "Told Daniel if (Ciriaco) steals second, you've got it."	The Red Sox put runners at first and second with one out in the eighth but Ross grounded into a double play.	Morrow gave up four hits in six scoreless innings. He walked one and struck out three.	Game notes	 Toronto DH Edwin Encarnacion (sore right big toe) was scratched from the lineup, along with SS Yunel Escobar (illness) and C Jeff Mathis (flulike symptoms). ... Valentine insisted he wasn't trying to be critical when he said Friday that his struggling Red Sox had "the weakest roster we've ever had in September in the history of baseball." On Sunday, Valentine called his earlier comments "a statement of fact because of the injuries and our Triple-A team in the playoffs." ... The Red Sox have not been caught stealing since Aug. 29, swiping 16 straight bases in that time.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MIAMI --  The Cincinnati Reds tied a season high with 17 hits and it was their final one that proved to be the biggest.	Ryan Ludwick hit a go-ahead single in the 11th inning to lift the Reds to a 5-4 win over the Miami Marlins on Sunday.	"That was a big one for us," Ludwick said. "That's a team fighting to spoil people probably and they gave us all we could handle for three straight days. Just to be able to get that one was very important.	Ludwick, Dioner Navarro, and Didi Gregorius each had three hits for the Reds, who left 14 men on base.	"We did get a lot of hits," Reds manager Dusty Baker said. "We left a ton of guys on base, had a lot of opportunities, which is the name of the game. The more opportunities you get, sooner or later you're going to bust through."	Jonathan Broxton came on to pitch the bottom of the 11th for his second save with the Reds.	Carlos Zambrano (7-10) was the Marlins' ninth pitcher of the game when he came on to pitch the 11th. Zambrano, who had not pitched since Sept. 7, issued a lead-off single to Chris Heisey and walked Joey Votto before Ludwick singled through the left side for a 5-4 lead.	"When you lay off that much, you can't ask too much," Marlins manager Ozzie Guillen said. "On the other hand my starting pitchers have been throwing seven, eight innings plus the last week, week and a half. That's why the guys in the bullpen have not been pitching that much."	Miami had an opportunity to score in the 10th when Giancarlo Stanton came to the plate with two runners on, but Logan Ondrusek (4-2) struck him out.	"Ondrusek came in and got a big, big out on Stanton," Baker said.	Donovan Solano drew a two-out walk from Broxton, who got John Buck to fly out to the deepest part of the ballpark to end the game. Buck's deep fly to center field was caught by Drew Stubbs just in front of the 418-foot wall.	"I knew in this ballpark to never give up on it because it's so deep out there," Stubbs said.	Jose Reyes hit a tying double off the right-field wall in the eighth inning off Mat Latos.	"I thought the ball that Reyes hit was a homer," Baker said. "I didn't see where it hit on the wall and I was glad it stayed in the ball park."	Reyes had three hits to lead the Marlins, who were searching for their first three-game sweep since June 29-July 1 when they swept Philadelphia.	"It's tough when you hit the ball good and you think you've got a home run and the ball doesn't go out," Reyes said. "It's kind of tough as a hitter but like I say it is what it is. You have to deal with it."	Latos pitched 7 2/3 innings allowing four runs and seven hits. He struck out eight and walked three.	"I tried my best to keep us in," Latos said. "I wound up giving up a lead, that's always aggravating. Seems like that's been the story of the year for me for the most part. We got a 'W' and we have to move forward. That magic number is getting closer and closer."	The Reds' magic number to clinch a playoff spot to begin the day was six over St. Louis and Los Angeles.	Gregorius' RBI single and Brandon Phillips's RBI ground out gave the Reds an early 2-0 lead.	Miami tied the game at 2-all with a two-run triple by Greg Dobbs.	Navarro's RBI single allowed the Reds to re-gain the lead at 3-2.	Cincinnati took a 4-2 lead after an RBI single by Ludwick in the sixth. The Marlins cut the deficit to 4-3 on a sacrifice fly by Donovan Solano.	Marlins starter Ricky Nolasco allowed three runs and 10 hits in five innings. Nolasco had won his last three starts including two shutouts over Washington.	"Obviously, this was not my best day," Nolasco said. "I got singled to death; a lot of ground balls just found the holes but it's part of the game. I just tried to go as deep as I could."	Game notes	 The Reds also had 17 hits on June 14 against Cleveland and July 23 at Houston. ... It was Navarro's first three-hit game since July 8, 2009 against Toronto while with Tampa Bay. ... Nolasco is 4-2 with a 3.00 ERA in his last seven starts. ... The Reds will send RHP Homer Bailey (11-9, 3.93 ERA) to the mound on Tuesday at Wrigley Field to face Cubs RHP Justin Germano (2-7, 6.24 ERA) to begin a three-game series. Miami will host Atlanta with RHP Nathan Eovaldi (4-12, 4.71 ERA) getting the start against Braves LHP Paul Maholm (12-10, 3.90 ERA).	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

HOUSTON --  Philadelphia still has a chance to make the playoffs with 15 games remaining. However, after losing three of four to the Houston Astros, even the Phillies admitted it just got harder.	Justin Maxwell hit a two-run double and Matt Dominguez added a two-run single in Houston's four-run seventh inning as the Astros rallied for a 7-6 victory against the Philadelphia Phillies on Sunday.	Philadelphia fell to 3½ games behind St. Louis and Los Angeles in the National League wild card race.	Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said losing three of four to the Astros really hurts, but added that his team has to keep on playing.	"We can turn it around," Manuel said. "We are four back. We have been in tougher situations than this. We have to keep going and keep trying. You get tested all the time. We have to play like hell, but we can do it. We aren't going to give up. We are going to play it out. We have done it before. Survive."	Carlos Corporan and Scott Moore homered for the Astros, who remained one loss away from reaching 100 for the second straight season.	"The guys don't quit," Houston interim manager Tony DeFrancesco said. "It seems like they've got some life and fire. We're trying to establish the familiarity with participating in a winning ballgame. It's fun, and the clubhouse has got a little energy now."	Wesley Wright (2-2) pitched a scoreless seventh to pick up the win. Wilton Lopez got the last five outs for his sixth save.	Jose Altuve reached on an error by third baseman Michael Martinez to begin the seventh and Jimmy Paredes was walked by Antonio Bastardo (2-5). Pinch hitter Brandon Laird walked off Phillippe Aumont to load the bases with one out.	Maxwell's double down the right-field line that just found chalk put the Astros ahead 5-4, and Dominguez followed with his two-run single.	"I was hoping and I was seeing the runners ahead of me going," Maxwell said of his hit. "I didn't see it hit the chalk. I just kept running."	After Dominguez moved to second on a passed ball, Justin De Fratus intentionally walked pinch hitter Jason Castro one out later but got Tyler Greene to ground out to end the inning.	Domonic Brown sliced the lead to 7-6 with a two-run double off Mickey Storey in the eighth. Lopez, however, struck out pinch hitter Laynce Nix and got a grounder from Nate Schierholtz to end the inning.	Jimmy Rollins led off the ninth with a single and moved to second on Erik Kratz's fly ball to right. Lopez got Chase Utley to fly out to left and intentionally walked Ryan Howard before Carlos Ruiz grounded to first to end the game.	Rollins said losing three of four to the Astros was not good but not deflating.	"It shouldn't be deflating," Rollins said. "We lose games. It obviously doesn't matter the name on the jersey. If we lose, we just don't have any more room. Would it matter if it was the Nationals? No."	Phillies starter Roy Halladay gave up three runs on six hits with seven strikeouts in six innings, remaining two wins shy of 200 for his career.	Halladay said the Astros' young lineup was hard to figure out.	"It is definitely a different, odd team to pitch to," Halladay said. "Sometimes they are aggressive, sometimes they are not. Sometimes they are taking. I think the whole series, we never figured out what their plan was. It was kind of all over the place. That made it tough."	Jordan Lyles gave up four runs on five hits with four walks and six strikeouts in five innings for Houston. Lyles has gone longer than five innings just once in his last six starts.	Philadelphia scored three runs in the fifth to take a 4-2 lead. Rollins singled with two outs, stole second and moved to third on Corporan's throwing error. Juan Pierre followed with a run-scoring double to left field.	Lyles intentionally walked Utley, and Howard followed with a two-run double to left but Howard was thrown out trying to stretch it to a triple.	Corporan's solo homer in the sixth pulled Houston to 4-3.	Philadelphia took a 1-0 lead in the first on Utley's sacrifice fly.	Moore's two-run homer in the third put the Astros ahead 2-1.	Game notes	 Houston OF Fernando Martinez was scratched from the lineup and replaced by Paredes in right field. ... Altuve was expected to get the day off Sunday but started after INF Jed Lowrie was given the day off due to soreness in his right leg, DeFrancesco said. Greene started at shortstop in place of Lowrie. . Philadelphia starts a three-game series Monday at the New York Mets with LHP Cliff Lee starting for the Phillies against RHP R.A. Dickey for the Mets. . Houston starts a three-game series at St. Louis on Tuesday with LHP Fernando Abad going for the Astros against RHP Kyle Lohse.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  The Los Angeles bullpen had no room for error the final 3 1/3 innings Sunday. The Angels also have no margin for error in the final 15 games of the season if they hope to make the playoffs.	Mark Trumbo hit a three-run homer and Dan Haren pitched effectively into the sixth inning as the Angels beat the Kansas City Royals 4-3 on Sunday.	After Haren departed, the Royals managed just one hit off Angels relievers Nick Maronde, Garrett Richards, Scott Downs, Jordan Walden and Kevin Jespen.	"Our bullpen came in and just got out after out in a game where they've got some guys that can drive the ball on their side where one mistake can tie the game," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "These guys are pitching with their backs against the wall and did a great job."	The Angels are third in the AL wild-card standings, where the top two qualify -- two games behind Oakland and Baltimore.	"We're in a situation where we have to pay attention to the standings," Scioscia said. "Everything is not totally in our control, but if we keep winning you keep pressure on the teams.	"Forget winning series. We're talking about winning every pitch. That's where we are. The only thing we control is how we play. We need to bring it for the last 15 games. It's getting to the point of the season, where we're going to have to get some help. Cause if every team wins out and we win out, we're on the outside looking in."	Trumbo, who had hit just .177 with 62 strikeouts in his previous 37 games to drop his average from .306 to .268, homered off Will Smith (5-8) in the second inning.	Haren (11-11) improved to 3-1 in his past four starts, holding the Royals to three runs, two earned, and five hits, while walking one and striking out five. He also moved to 4-0 in five career starts at Kansas City.	"The amount of games we can lose is very limited, so every loss hurts," Haren said. "It's not that we're not trying to catch Texas. For us rather than scoreboard watch, our games are so important. We just can't lose that many games. Every game is so magnified right now."	Torii Hunter, who has 17 RBIs in his past 18 games, singled home Erick Aybar, who had doubled, in the first inning.	After closer Ernesto Frieri gave up two home runs in the ninth Saturday to blow a save and take the loss and throwing 30 pitches in a game Friday, Jespen was summoned in the ninth and picked up his second save in four chances. Jespen has held opponents to one earned run in 11 2/3 innings in his last 12 outings.	The Angels got a major scare in the fourth inning when outfielders Mike Trout and Hunter collided while chasing Billy Butler's double to right-center. Scioscia and the trainer came out, but both remained in the game. Butler wound up scoring on Howie Kendrick's throwing error after Jeff Francoeur's infield single, trimming the Angels' lead to 4-3.	Tony Abreu led off the Kansas City third with his first home run in nearly two years. Abreu's previous home run was Sept. 26, 2010, while with Arizona against the Los Angeles Dodgers.	Salvador Perez, who had the walk-off homer Saturday, doubled to lead off the second, advanced to third on Mike Moustakas' ground out and scored on Jeff Francoeur's ground out for the Royals' first run.	Smith gave up four runs on seven hits and two walks in five innings.	"It didn't start out the way I wanted to," Smith said. "Trumbo's homer was a two-seamer right down the middle. He's a good hitter. He did what he's supposed to do with it.	"After the home run I started to dial it up.  I need to do it in the first inning, not the third inning after giving up four runs."	Game notes	 DH Albert Pujols was not in the original Angels lineup after his wife gave birth to a daughter, Esther Grace, at 3:30 a.m. Sunday at a Kansas City hospital. Pujols, who went to high school and junior college in the Kansas City area, arrived at Kauffman Stadium and told Scioscia he was "ready to DH." ... RHP Ervin Santana, who was struck by a line drive in the right forearm on Wednesday against Oakland, will likely start Friday against Chicago, giving him eight days between starts. ... RHP Jake Odorizzi, the Royals' top pitching prospect, was promoted from Triple-A Omaha, which was eliminated Saturday by Reno in the Pacific Coast League championship series. He was 11-3 with a 2.93 ERA with Omaha. The Royals also called up four others from Omaha: C Adam Moore, IF Irving Falu, LHP Tommy Hottovy and RHP Nate Adcock. ... Both teams are off Monday. The Angels open a homestand Tuesday against AL West-division leading Texas.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MILWAUKEE --  Ryan Braun helped the Brewers head out on a crucial road trip with plenty of confidence.	Braun hit two home runs and rookie pitcher Wily Peralta gave up two singles in eight innings, and the Milwaukee Brewers beat the New York Mets 3-0 Sunday.	On Tuesday, Milwaukee goes to Pittsburgh for three games. Then it's off to NL East-leading Washington for four games before a three-game trip to Central-leading Cincinnati.	This road trip is going to be a tough road trip, and we know it," Milwaukee manager Ron Roenicke said.	The Brewers began Sunday 2½ games out of the second wild card spot behind St. Louis, which played later at Los Angeles.	"A month ago we were out of it," Aramis Ramirez said. "All of a sudden we got hot. We're right there. We've got a chance."	Braun, the reigning NL MVP, now has 201 home runs in his career, as Milwaukee won for the 20th time in its last 26 games.	Peralta (2-0) struck out five and walked one in his third start, and got his first major league hit when he doubled in the seventh.	"He's been amazing," Braun said. "I look at his stuff, and I don't know how he's not the top prospect in baseball. He has dominant stuff.  There are very few guys who have stuff like that in baseball."	John Axford pitched the ninth for his 29th save.	New York's Chris Young (4-8) threw 6 2/3 innings and allowed three runs -- all solo homers -- and eight hits.	"He's a fly ball pitcher," New York manager Terry Collins said. "If you get enough of the ball here, it's going to get out. But he pitched well. He kept us in the game. Two hits isn't going to get us very far."	The Mets lost for the eighth time in nine games.	Braun is the sixth Brewers player to reach 200 homers and seventh to reach 40 in a season. His homer to lead off the sixth was his 103rd run batted in of the year and gave Milwaukee a 3-0 lead.	"Individual accomplishments are always far more enjoyable when they come in the context of a team win, a meaningful win," Braun said. "We're in a position where every obviously every game is of the utmost importance. It's certainly easier to enjoy it when it comes on a day like this."	In the fourth, Braun also led off with a deep home run to right-center. Ramirez, the featured bobblehead giveaway at Miller Park, followed by smashing another long blast to left-center for a 2-0 lead.	That was more than enough Peralta, who led Milwaukee to its 19th victory in its last 22 home games. He stranded Josh Thole at second by getting Ruben Tejada to fly out in the third. In the sixth, Andres Torres led off with a single and took second on a sacrifice bunt by Young. Tejada fouled out and Daniel Murphy grounded out, however.	Game notes	 Milwaukee broke its single-season strikeout record when Peralta struck out Lucas Duda in the second. The Brewers now have 1,261 strikeouts, which leads the NL. ... Braun had 33 homers last year. ... Young is 2-7 in his last 13 starts. ... Milwaukee has at least one extra-base hit in its past 85 games. ... On Monday, New York begins a 10-day homestand, its second-longest of the year. ... Milwaukee first baseman Corey Hart has not played since he sprained his left ankle last Sunday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MINNEAPOLIS -- Adam Dunn said he feels fine and Jake Peavy was in good spirits after notching another win. The Chicago White Sox look ready for the stretch run, with a big test coming in less than 24 hours.	Peavy baffled Minnesota again, Dayan Viciedo and Dunn homered, and the White Sox beat the Twins 9-2 on Sunday.	Chicago scored six runs in the sixth inning to support Peavy (11-11) and stay ahead of Detroit in the AL Central.	The Tigers were playing Cleveland on Sunday and travel to Chicago for a makeup game on Monday. It will be the final time the two teams meet this season.	"It's going to be a game with a lot of emotion," Peavy said. "We got our hands full, but at the same time we think we can get it done."	Joe Mauer homered in his return after missing five games with back spasms, but the Twins weren't able to avoid the sweep and lost to Chicago for the 13th time in 16 games.	After Alexi Casilla's double in the fifth made it 3-2, Dunn and Viciedo went deep off Scott Diamond (11-8) in the sixth to squash the Twins' comeback.	Dunn opened the inning with a towering solo shot that traveled 415 feet before finally falling into the first row of the upper deck in right field and bouncing back on the field.	Viciedo drove his 21st home run -- and Chicago's 192nd as a team -- into the upper deck in left after Alex Rios tripled.	Chicago batted around and added three more unearned runs in the sixth, capped by Dunn's RBI single.	The slugger returned to the lineup on Saturday after missing seven games with a strained muscle on his right side. He said he feels fine and is ready to contribute down the stretch.	"Seemed to work out perfect," Dunn said. "I'm going to be in there tomorrow. That's what I wanted. I wanted to be able to play against those guys and the rest of the season. It worked out."	Peavy allowed two runs and struck out six in six innings. The right-hander is 4-0 with a 1.73 ERA against the Twins since the All-Star break and 0-6 in eight starts against everyone else over that time.	After Mauer homered in the first, Peavy retired the next eight Twins hitters before Mauer doubled in the fourth.	Justin Morneau walked, but Peavy struck out Ryan Doumit and Chris Parmelee to end the threat and keep Chicago in front.	White Sox pitchers allowed just five runs on 12 hits in the three-game series.	"They're going to be right there, as they are right now," Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said about the White Sox. "That's a very good baseball team built with a good pitching staff. There are a lot of arms that come out of that pen throwing really hard and they have some starters that have been there and done it."	Following Monday's makeup game, the White Sox travel to Kansas City for a three-game series with the Royals. Chicago has won just 10 of its last 22 games against Detroit and Kansas City.	"Detroit is a great team. They're going to take care of business," Peavy said. "We're trying to win this thing ourselves and not have anyone else have to win or have to lose for us. It sure is nice when that happens, but Detroit's a great them and they aren't going anywhere."	Diamond has just one win in his last seven starts after getting off to a hot start.	After allowing a career-worst 10 hits in his last outing, Diamond surrendered six runs on seven hits in 5 1/3 innings on Sunday.	Minnesota is done playing Chicago, but can still help its rival out down the stretch. Six of the Twins' final 15 games are against the Tigers.	"We're playing some playoff teams from here on out and we're going to give them everything we have," Gardenhire said.	Kevin Youkilis and Dewayne Wise each added two RBIs as the White Sox earned their ninth sweep and second over Minnesota.	"It was good all the way around," Chicago manager Robin Ventura said. "Home runs are good, but I like the ones where we just push a couple across there."	Game notes	Jose Quintana (6-4, 3.52) will start for the White Sox against the Tigers on Monday. The rookie beat Detroit on Sept. 10, allowing one run and striking out seven in seven innings. Quintana had allowed 12 runs in his previous two starts and will be pitching on an extra two days of rest. "It actually does feel good about this time of season to get a couple extra days," he said. "It gives your arm a little extra strength so I'll feel good for tomorrow." ... Twins slugger Josh Willingham was given the day off and Ben Revere played left field. ... Youkilis' double to center in the third just missed clearing the wall. Youkilis needs one more home run to become the sixth White Sox player with at least 20 this season. ... Out since Wednesday with an oblique strain, Doumit caught for the Twins and went 0 for 3.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CHICAGO -- Anthony Rizzo had another series of firsts. The toughest for him to conquer was the curtain call.	Rizzo hit two home runs and drove in six to lift the Chicago Cubs to a 13-9 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates in the third game of a four-game set.	Rizzo hit a two-run shot in a four-run fifth inning, then capped a five-run sixth with his first career grand slam to seize the lead for Chicago. The six RBIs are a career high. It was also the 23-year-old's first multihomer game.	He reappeared from the dugout briefly after his grand slam to acknowledge the crowd of 33,559.	"I didn't know what (my teammates) were saying and then I realized that's what you do," Rizzo said. "It was pretty cool."	Rizzo became the first Cubs player since Aramis Ramirez in July of 2010 to drive in six runs.	"Everything he's done up here is obviously what we've expected," Cubs manager Dale Sveum said. "We don't expect any more or any less. ... He's been spectacular since he's been here."	Pedro Alvarez hit two homers and drove in five for the Pirates, who lost for the 12th time in 15 games. Pittsburgh came into play Sunday two games behind the Los Angeles Dodgers and St. Louis Cardinals for the second wild card.	Rod Barajas went deep for Pittsburgh, and Joe Mather hit a solo shot for the Cubs.	Staked to a 6-1 lead, the Pirates were unable to hold off the feisty Cubs, who have taken five of the last six against Pittsburgh.	Rizzo's two-run, opposite field blast highlighted a four-run fifth, then he launched a 3-1 pitch into the left-center field bleachers off Jared Hughes (2-2) an inning later to put the Cubs up 10-9 and send the home crowd into a frenzy.	Rizzo recalled a game-winning homer he hit in July against St. Louis -- the grand slam didn't quite compare.	"I don't think it tops the walk-off, but it was a great game," Rizzo said. "We kept fighting the last couple of days and showing some resilience."	David DeJesus had a pinch-hit, two-run single in a three-run ninth for Chicago.	Alvarez carried the Pirates early, but they could not tack on late. The big lefty followed Gaby Sanchez's leadoff single in the fifth with an opposite-field shot onto Waveland Avenue to extend the lead to four.	After the Cubs rallied to get within one, Alvarez hit another opposite field shot in the sixth with two men on to pad the lead again. It was Alvarez's sixth multihomer game of the season. He passed Andrew McCutchen for the team lead with 29.	The Pirates had a chance to tie it with a Starling Marte leadoff triple in the seventh, but Marte was caught in a rundown on a fake to third, throw to first by Cubs reliever Jaye Chapman after Neil Walker and McCutchen failed to get the run in.	"Actually that's a forced balk, break late try to get the run to second and try to steal a run at home is what it was," Pirates manager Clint Hurdle explained. "I do believe if Starling could've shown a little more patience that play would have worked for us, but in the heat of the moment he left a little bit early."	Jeff Beliveau (1-0) allowed Alvarez's second home run, but recorded the final two outs of the sixth to earn his first career win.	Barajas homered on an 0-2 pitch with a man on and the pitcher on deck in the second inning to reach double-digits for the year.	McCutchen had an RBI single in the second and reached base four times. He has reached safely in nine of his last 11 plate appearances this series.	Pirates starter Jeff Locke was backed by a consistent flow of Pittsburgh offense, but couldn't get through the fifth inning to earn his first big league victory.	The 24-year-old Locke was staked to a 6-1 lead until things fell apart in a four-run fifth.	Mather's one-out solo homer started a string of four straight hits for the Cubs, which included Rizzo's two-run shot.	Cubs starter Chris Volstad had trouble finding the strike zone, and was hit hard when he did. The big righty gave up six runs on 10 hits through 4 2/3 innings. He walked four and struck out three.	Volstad had won three of his last four starts after enduring a brutal 24-start winless skid that spanned 13 months.	Alfonso Soriano drove in his 100th run of the season with a first-inning single to bring home Rizzo. It's Soriano's third career 100-RBI season, and first since 2005 when he had a career-high 104 with Texas.	Game notes	 Pirates manager Clint Hurdle removed RHP James McDonald from the starting rotation due to a poor second half. RHP Kyle McPherson will take McDonald's turn in the rotation Wednesday against Milwaukee. McDonald is 3-5 with a 7.08 ERA since the All-Star break. ... Chicago sends LHP Travis Wood (6-11, 4.23 ERA) to the mound in the series finale Monday against Pittsburgh's RHP Kevin Correia (10-9, 4.29).	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CLEVELAND --  The Detroit Tigers lost their manager, catcher and a crucial game in the AL Central race.	Now, the Tigers are hoping to quickly rebound from their sour Sunday after twice blowing leads to the Cleveland Indians.	Lonnie Chisenhall singled in the winning run with one out in the ninth inning to give Cleveland a 7-6 win -- the Indians' first at home when trailing after eight innings in more than a year.	Tigers manager Jim Leyland was ejected and catcher Alex Avila hurt in a collision with Prince Fielder as Detroit dropped two games back in the AL Central. The Tigers go to Chicago to face the first-place White Sox on Monday.	"It was a good comeback," Leyland said. "There wasn't anything cheap about it. It was a heck of a ballgame. Give them credit. That's the way it goes. Turn the page and move on."	Before the game, Leyland said the makeup of Thursday's rainout with the White Sox would be huge since it is the last meeting between the rivals.	It is even bigger for the Tigers after Cleveland's comeback.	Jason Kipnis doubled off Jose Valverde (3-3) and scored the tying run on a one-out triple by Carlos Santana. Right fielder Don Kelly nearly made a leaping catch, but the ball dropped as he crashed into the wall.	Valverde then intentionally walked both Michael Brantley and Ezequiel Carrera to face Chisenhall, who lined the first pitch to right-center.	"You've got to get the ball to the outfield there," Chisenhall said. "They weren't walking guys to get to me, I'd like to think. They were trying to get the bases loaded and have the force out.	"It's definitely exciting. You like to win games like that."	Esmil Rogers (2-1) pitched one inning for Cleveland, an AL-worst 17-45 since the All-Star break, and just 11-37 since July 26.	Miguel Cabrera, with visiting Detroit fans chanting "MVP! MVP!" hit a three-run homer in the seventh to put the Tigers ahead 6-5. Cabrera connected off Joe Smith for a 402-foot drive.	But Valverde got his fifth blown save in 36 chances as he worked for the third day in a row.	"We were asking a lot of Valverde," Leyland said. "He had better velocity than he had the last couple of nights. We talked to him before the game and he said he was good to go."	Valverde credited the Indians.	"I made good pitches, but they hit them," he said. "I want to be perfect, but I am not. Now, let's go to Chicago and win."	Cleveland scored two unearned runs in the fifth for a 4-3 lead after trailing 3-0. Leyland got tossed for arguing the play that put the Indians ahead.	With the score tied at 3, first-base umpire Brian Knight ruled shortstop Jhonny Peralta's throw trying for an inning-ending double play was too late as Brantley scored from third base.	First baseman Prince Fielder hopped off the bag and yelled and Leyland came out to disagree. Cabrera was restrained by other umps from going across the diamond from his third base position to join in.	Earlier in the inning, Leyland disputed a call by Knight that also kept Detroit from turning a double play.	"They were unbelievable bang-bang plays," Leyland said. "At this time of year with the importance, you get a little more excited. Obviously, I thought they were out. The umpire saw it differently."	Avila left in the sixth after colliding with Fielder. Avila was about to catch Santana's foul pop along the warning track in front of Detroit's dugout when Fielder, listed at 275 pounds, ran into him. The ball dropped and so did Avila.	"It looked like a knockout punch," Leyland said. "The elbow got him in the jaw."	Leyland said trainers told him Avila has a sprained jaw, no concussion, and could possibly play Monday. Leyland said he likely was going to rest Avila anyway against White Sox lefty Jose Quintana.	Given new life, Santana got an RBI single on another questionable call by Knight. With Asdrubal Cabrera on second, Santana hit a grounder between third and short that Miguel Cabrera snared with a dive. His high throw from his knees pulled Fielder off the bag, but the first baseman tagged Santana. Knight ruled safe as Asdrubal Cabrera kept running and scored.	Fielder and acting manager Lloyd McClendon both protested.	"It was a weird game," Tigers starter Rick Porcello said. "Whether we get those calls or not is tough to say. It was frustrating, but you have to deal with it and push on."	Detroit took a 2-0 lead in the first off Ubaldo Jimenez. Both runs scored as Brennan Boesch was safe with a bases-loaded infield single when Jimenez fielded his slow tapper, but threw low and late to first for an error.	Cleveland loaded the bases on three walks in the first, but Porcello got Russ Canzler to hit the ball back to him and made the play for the third out.	Delmon Young, hitting .167 (5 of 30) in the Tigers' previous eight games, hit an RBI single to make it 3-0 in the third.	Porcello gave up three hits in the fourth as Cleveland got within 3-2. Shin-Soo Choo's two-run bloop single to left drove in Canzler, who had singled and came after a two-out double by Jack Hannahan.	Game notes	 Cleveland won the season series, 10-8. ... Tigers CF Austin Jackson was a late scratch because of a sore left knee. He got hurt trying to make a catch Saturday when he ran into the center field fence. "I definitely anticipate playing (Monday)," Jackson said. "We'll see. It hurt too much today." ... Peralta played his 73rd straight game without an error, longest streak by a Tigers shortstop since at least 1957. Eddie Brinkman had a 72-game streak in 1972. ... Miguel Cabrera has hit .369 (7 of 19) with 2 homers and 7 RBIs off Smith. ... Jimenez, 1-9 in 13 starts since the All-Star break, still has a 9-16 record and avoided becoming the first Indians pitcher to lose 17 games since Tom Candiotti went 7-18 in 1987. ... Indians 1B Matt LaPorta was twice shaken up after crashing into a railing while trying to catch foul popups in the same at-bat by Tigers 2B Omar Infante in the ninth. He stayed in the game.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  The sun finally peeked through the clouds and a rainbow appeared beyond center field soon after the Texas Rangers finished playing.	All around, it was a bright ending to a drizzly Sunday.	Matt Harrison came within one out of a complete game for his 17th victory and the Rangers beat Seattle 2-1, adding to their AL West lead over Oakland for the first time in 10 days.	"The only thing we can do is keep winning series, and do what we've been doing the past month," Harrison said. "The way they're playing, we've just go to keep going."	On his 27th birthday, Harrison (17-9) became the fourth American League pitcher to 17 victories.	Adrian Beltre hit his 33rd homer and Mitch Moreland had an RBI double to back the All-Star lefty who has won nine consecutive starts against Seattle since May 2010.	"Glad we got two runs to support him a little bit," catcher Mike Napoli said. "Overall, everything was pretty good. He had a good changeup, mixed in a couple of curveballs and backdoor sliders. For the most part, he was throwing strikes and missing barrels."	With runners on first and third and two outs in the ninth, Koji Uehara struck out Michael Saunders to end the game. It Uehara's first save for Texas since being traded from Baltimore in July 2011.	The start of the game was delayed 2 hours and 12 minutes by rain. A light drizzle was still falling when Harrison threw the first pitch, and persisted through the game that took only 2 hours and 20 minutes to play.	Two-time defending AL champion Texas (87-59) has the league's best record, and now has a three-game division lead over Oakland. The A's lost for only the second time in 10 games Sunday, 9-5 at home against Baltimore.	Texas had a 5 ½-game lead on Sept. 6 after winning at Kansas City, gaining a half-game that day on the idle A's. Before Sunday's games, that lead had shrunk to two games -- the Rangers' smallest since April 13, a week into the season.	"They're playing unbelievable," Harrison said. "We've just got to keep winning series."	Texas has won eight of its last nine series, and hasn't lost consecutive games in more than a month.	The Rangers have their final off day of the regular season Monday. They start a three-game series Tuesday at the Los Angeles Angels, before spending next weekend in Seattle and then playing seven of their last 10 games against the A's.	Harrison scattered six hits and struck out five, and his only walk was to Franklin Gutierrez with one out in the ninth. After Kyle Seager's infield popout for the second out, Montero singled to right and manager Ron Washington made the pitching change after 119 pitches.	After allowing a single to start the game, Harrison didn't let a runner past first until Justin Smoak led off the eighth with his 16th homer. Harrison benefited from three double plays -- two that he started.	"He did a good job coming in at both left-handers and right-handers, he works that changeup off the fastball, he's able to cut his fastball or sink it, rides it every now and again, a nice breaking ball," Mariners manager Eric Wedge said. "He's got a quick tempo and helped himself, he's great defensively out there, a couple of big double plays."	Blake Beavan (9-10), pitching for the first time since Sept. 4, allowed two runs and seven hits over seven innings. The right-hander was the Rangers' first-round draft pick five years ago before being sent to Seattle in 2010 with Smoak in the Cliff Lee trade.	Beltre put the Rangers up 1-0 in the fourth with his eighth homer in 15 games. The 33 homers are one more than he had in his debut with the Rangers last season. The only time he hit more in his career was in 2004 for the Los Angeles Dodgers, when he led the majors with 48.	Murphy had a leadoff single in the fifth and scored when Moreland pulled a double into the right-field corner.	"We needed the home run from Beltre and we needed the double by Mitch," Washington said. "Up and down our order, someone's going to get one."	Game notes	 The Rangers said after the game Martin Perez will start Friday's game at Seattle in place of struggling Scott Feldman. ... Seattle played its majors-high 24th rubber game of a series. The Mariners are 11-13 in those games, and had won seven of the previous eight. ... The Rangers are 16-7 in rubber games. ... The NFL's Dallas Cowboys played under sunny skies in Seattle, where they lost. ... During the rain delay, fans were able to see the start of both the Cowboys and A's games on split screen on the big video board. ... The announced paid attendance was 45,928, the 34th sellout at Rangers Ballpark. But a lot of bought tickets were unused on the wet day.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  Baltimore manager Buck Showalter had a meeting with his coaches to decide whether to start catcher Matt Wieters in Sunday's series finale.	"It was a short conversation," Showalter said. "Matt means a lot to us and we like his presence in the lineup."	Wieters hit two solo home runs and Endy Chavez had four hits to help the Orioles beat the Oakland Athletics 9-5 on Sunday and remain within a game of the New York Yankees in the AL East.	"I'm finally putting the barrel on a few balls," Wieters said. "That's something you are always working on and once the game comes around you have to let it go."	Chavez drove in two runs for the Orioles, who have won four of six in snapping a three-game road losing streak. J.J. Hardy, Mark Reynolds, Manny Machado, Chris Davis and Robert Andino also drove in runs.	The victory improved the Orioles to 82-64 on the season, giving Baltimore its first winning season since 1997 -- the last year the franchise made a postseason appearance.	"Every game right now is a must win," Wieters said. "This is a tough place to win. To be able to get one, we'll take it, move on to Seattle and try to win a couple up there."	Josh Reddick, who drove in three runs, and Stephen Drew hit two-run home runs for the Athletics, who are two games ahead of the Orioles for the first wild-card spot. Adam Rosales had two hits.	"When you win the first two games you want to get greedy and take that third game." A's manager Bob Melvin said. "We're playing it day to day but going into this series you got a chance to take two of three from a good team like that you'll take it. Especially after the first inning, scoring a couple of runs on Reddick's home run, we really thought we had a chance to win this game as well."	Brian Matusz (6-10) retired all six batters he faced, two on strikeouts, to earn the victory. Jim Johnson got the last out for his 43rd save.	A's starter Dan Straily (2-1) lasted 4 2/3 innings, giving up four runs and five hits. He walked five and struck out one.	"I made a lot of mistakes," Straily said. "I left a lot of balls up, and that's as many walks as I've ever given up in my life. I was just out of character."	Straily's effort ended the 44-game streak in which A's pitchers had walked three or fewer batters.	Randy Wolf went four innings in his first start for the Orioles following three relief appearances. He gave up two runs and six hits, walked two and struck out four in his longest outing since going seven for Milwaukee in a loss to Philadelphia on Aug. 19.	"He's a veteran pitcher and knows how to pitch," Wieters said. "No one was too concerned when they got the two runs early. He had a shutdown inning after that and gave us two more good innings."	Wolf threw 72 pitches.	"He was our best option and kept us in the game," Showalter said. "A veteran like that knows how to minimize the damage."	Reddick's 29th home run, a two-run shot into the bleachers in right field, gave the A's a 2-0 lead in the first.	Wieters' first homer, with one out in the second, cut the lead in half. His fourth-inning home run put the Orioles ahead to stay.	Hardy's RBI single in the third tied it. Reynolds walked with the bases loaded in the fifth and Chavez's two-run single followed Machado's RBI double in the seventh.	Drew's two-run homer in the eighth made it 7-4.	Andino and Davis drove in runs for the Orioles in the ninth. Reddick added an RBI for the A's in the ninth.	Game notes	 Orioles' LHP Troy Patton (ankle) pitched an inning in instructional league Sunday. He's slated to pitch at least once more and could rejoin the team next weekend. ... A's OF Coco Crisp was out of the lineup with an allergic reaction in his left eye. ... O's DH Jim Thome (neck) is scheduled to play in simulated games Monday and Tuesday. ... RHP Chris Tillman (7-2, 3.39) goes for the Orioles in Seattle on Monday night. He's 3-0 with an 0.83 ERA in three starts against his former team. ... RHP A.J. Griffin (6-0, 1.94) will pitch for the A's in Detroit on Tuesday. He's the only ML pitcher since at least 1918 to allow three runs or fewer and walk two or less in each of his first 11 starts. ... Of Weiters' 21 homers, 12 have been solo shots. ... A's OF Yoenis Cespedes played CF for just the second time. ... The A's tied a season-high by using seven pitchers.

SAN DIEGO --  Even blowing a six-run lead late in the game couldn't stop the San Diego Padres.	Rookie Yonder Alonso singled in the ninth inning to drive in the winning run and cap a wild offensive game, leading the Padres to a 12-11 victory over the Colorado Rockies on Sunday.	Colorado scored six times in the eighth inning, tying the game on rookie Josh Rutledge's grand slam.	The Padres won for the 19th time in 25 games. San Diego won its sixth straight home series and has gone 23-7 at Petco Park since just after the All-Star break.	San Diego is playing with so much confidence that they think they are still players in the NL wild-card race. The Padres are 5 1/2 games back with 15 games to play and four teams between them and the final berth.	"Why not," Alonso asked. "We feel good about ourselves and where we are headed."	While the odds are stacked heavily against a wild-card bid, San Diego is a team no other club wants to play right now.	"That team is playing some fantastic baseball," Rockies manager Jim Tracy said.	In the ninth inning, Everth Cabrera reached on a one-out infield single against Matt Belisle (3-7). With two outs, Belisle balked Cabrera to second and then intentionally walked Chase Headley to bring up Alonso.	The left-hander lined a ball right at left fielder Andrew Brown, whose throw was slightly late as Cabrera slid across home plate with the winning run and start the celebration.	"The first guy I saw (after the hit) was Chase coming at me," Alonso said. "I was like, 'Oh boy, here we go.' I was kind of backing away because I knew I was going to get it."	Joe Thatcher (1-4), who came on to strike out the final two batters with runners on first and second in the ninth, picked up the win.	The clubs combined for 23 runs and 27 hits.	Trailing 11-5 after San Diego scored eight runs in the fifth, the Rockies used their own big inning against three rookie relievers to get back in the game.	"I don't like roller coasters," Padres manager Bud Black said. "Every now and then you have to take one. You have to take the ride, and we did. We ended up OK."	After Cory Burns started the eighth and allowed a run on two hits and an error, Tommy Layne came in and hit Charlie Blackmon with a pitch to load the bases.	Layne then walked Dexter Fowler to force in another run before being replaced by Nick Vincent. Rutledge hit Vincent's first pitch into the left-field stands to tie the game at 11.	"We just kept battling, every guy," Rutledge said. "Every guy who went to the plate had good at-bats, and we were just trying to string some runs together."	John Baker's two-run single with two outs off Rockies reliever Adam Ottavino in the fifth tied the score at 5. Pinch-hitter Andy Parrino followed with an RBI single to put San Diego ahead.	Cabrera, who had three RBIs, lined a two-run double into the right-field corner. He then stole third and scored on catcher Jordan Pacheco's throwing error.	After Logan Forsythe's infield single brought on reliever Matt Reynolds, Headley hit a two-run homer to left to cap the inning.	"I made some bad choices along the way," Ottavino said.  "I didn't do my job. The pitches I make that were good they hit hard. My seven runs were a major contribution to (the loss)."	Headley extended his career highs with his 28th homer and 104 RBIs, tops in the NL. Headley leads the majors with 20 home runs and 62 RBIs since the All-Star break.	Game notes	 Tracy said if LHP Jorge De La Rosa checks out medically, he would start at least once in the final 17 games. De La Rosa, who made his third rehab start Saturday night, hasn't pitched in the majors since he underwent Tommy John surgery in June 2011. ... Black said there is no timetable for when LF Carlos Quentin (sore right knee) might return to the starting lineup. Quentin has missed five start starts. ... Rockies RHP Jhoulys Chacin (2-5, 4.86) opposes Giants LHP Madison Bumgarner (14-10, 3.32) in the opener of a three-game series on Monday night. ... After a day off, Padres LHP Eric Stults (6-2, 2.54) will face Diamondbacks RHP Ian Kennedy (13-11, 4.21) in the first of three at Arizona on Tuesday night.

LOS ANGELES --  Jon Jay was having a miserable time at the plate until the 12th inning, when he hit a clutch RBI double that made he and his teammates forget all the ugly at-bats that preceded it.	The go-ahead hit sparked a three-run rally for the St. Louis Cardinals, who earned a split of their four-game series against the Los Angeles Dodgers with a 5-2 victory Sunday and regained undisputed possession of the second NL wild-card spot.	"It was a long one and both teams fought hard," Jay said after the 4-hour, 25-minute marathon. "Everyone knows what's at stake right now and we've got our work cut out for us.	"We haven't been playing too well lately, but we've been playing hard. Today we came up with a win on getaway day and it put us back up again. That's huge. But every game from here on out is our most important game. We've been there before, so we know what we've got to do. It's just a matter of doing it."	John Ely (0-2), the ninth of a franchise-record 10 pitchers used by Dodgers manager Don Mattingly, issued a leadoff walk to Matt Carpenter and Jay drove him in from second base with a line drive into the right field corner on an 0-2 changeup.	"Jon had an uncharacteristic day for himself up to that point, but he's been very good this season and filled a big hole for us in the leadoff spot. And today he came through with one of the biggest hits of our year right now," manager Mike Matheny said. "We had a tough time today. You look at that scoreboard and all those Ks, I mean, we had a lot of strikeouts (15), so we just needed somebody to step up."	Jay finished the 2-5 trip 4 for 32 with two RBIs. He struck out his first three times up Sunday and was 1 for 6.	"You've got to stay positive, and that's what I tried to do all day," Jay said. "I tried not to let my other at-bats bother me. I was happy I got a chance to do something to help the team and it worked out. He's got a good changeup, and I was just hoping he'd leave something out over the plate. He did, and I was able to capitalize on it."	Jay scored the second run of the inning on an infield hit up the middle by Allen Craig, and the final one came in on Ely's bases-loaded walk to Yadier Molina.	Rookie Shelby Miller (1-0) pitched one inning for his first major league victory. Jason Motte got three outs for his 35th save in 42 chances after giving up the tying and winning runs in Saturday night's 4-3 loss.	"If you have a bad day, you want to get back out there and move past the last outing. And I was able to do that today," Motte said. "After something like that, you have to have a short memory because you really don't have a choice. If you re-live every pitch and every out over again every single day, you'll drive yourself insane. I just looked at the video yesterday after the game to see what I did and didn't do."	Both teams have 15 games remaining to settle the wild-card situation. The Cardinals' next nine games are against the Houston Astros and Chicago Cubs, who are a combined 81 games under .500 and 69½ games out of first place. The Dodgers embark on a nine-game trip against East-leading Washington, Central-leading Cincinnati and San Diego before ending the regular season with a six-game homestand against Colorado and West-leading San Francisco.	"We've really been a pretty good road club until that last trip, and we're going to have our hands full again," Mattingly said.	The Dodgers won six of the 11 meetings with St. Louis, and have beaten the Cardinals in consecutive season series for the first time since 1995-96. In case of a tie for the wild card, the Dodgers would get home-field advantage in a one-game playoff.	"We're just taking it one game at a time, and we've got a great chance of being there right at the end," Dodgers center fielder Matt Kemp said. "We're going to be in every game and fight to the end, no matter who we play. We've got a tough road trip coming up, and we'll see what happens. We've got to turn the page and get ready for Washington."	Los Angeles wasted a leadoff double in the sixth by Kemp, who flied out to center field against Fernando Salas with the bases loaded to end the 10th after the right-hander intentionally walked Andre Ethier.	"I have all the respect for all their hitters," Matheny said. "But that particular situation set itself up to get us a little more freedom against Kemp because we didn't have to worry about righty against lefty. So it worked out well."	Ethier tied the score 2-all in the third with his 19th homer, getting the barrel of the bat on a 2-0 pitch that was low and inside and driving it into the pavilion seats in right-center with two outs after a leadoff walk to Matt Treanor.	Right-hander Stephen Fife, making his fourth major league start and first since Aug. 1 in place of injured Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw, recorded his first six outs on strikeouts. But in-between the first and second ones, the Cardinals took a 2-0 lead as Craig hit an RBI double and Matt Holliday scored on a wild pitch to Molina.	Molina walked, then stole second while David Freese swung at a third strike. Treanor, making his first start behind the plate since Sept. 2, got out of his crouch and headed for the dugout, thinking it was the third out before realizing his mistake. Fife's 31-pitch inning finally ended on a called third strike that had Skip Schumaker fuming at umpire Dana DeMuth.	Fife threw 88 pitches over five innings, allowing two runs and four hits while striking out nine -- two more than he had in his other three outings combined.	Game notes	 Treanor drew a walk all three times up. Dee Gordon pinch-ran for him in the seventh, but Molina threw him out trying to steal. ... The Cardinals have had only six pitchers start a game for them to this point, tying Cincinnati and San Francisco for the fewest in the majors.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ATLANTA -- The Atlanta Braves gave themselves a glimmer of hope in the NL East.	Hey, after what happened to these guys a year ago, they're not giving up on chasing down the first-place Washington Nationals.	Mike Minor threw six strong innings, Dan Uggla broke it open with a two-run single and the Braves denied Gio Gonzalez his 20th win, completing a sweep of Washington with a 5-1 victory Sunday night. Atlanta closed within 5½ games of the Nationals with a little over two weeks left in the regular season.	"There's still a lot of baseball left," Atlanta manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "Who knows what could happen? We've just got to keep playing and keep winning ballgames."	The Braves certainly know anything is possible. Last season, they had a double-figure lead in the wild-card race with a month to go -- and blew it. St. Louis passed Atlanta on the final day and rubbed salt in the wound by winning an improbable World Series championship.	"Look what happened to us last year," Uggla said. "We're back in the hunt. We still need a little bit of magic, but we'll see what happens."	Minor (9-10) allowed five hits before turning it over to the bullpen. The left-hander had an ERA of 6.20 at the end of June, but he's pitched brilliantly since then to become a valued member of the rotation with the playoffs approaching. He had not allowed a run in his two previous starts, covering 12 2/3 innings, and he kept the Nationals off the board until the sixth, lowering his ERA to 4.31.	"I made my goals a little more realistic," Minor said. "At the beginning of the year, I wanted to pitch a shutout or a no-hitter every time I went out there. Now, I know if I get through six innings and give up three runs or less, it's a good day."	The Braves broke a scoreless tie in the third against Gonzalez (19-8) on Chipper Jones' run-scoring single. Freddie Freeman followed with a sacrifice fly.	Washington closed to 2-1 on Ian Desmond's RBI single in the sixth, but the Braves pulled away with a three-run seventh, taking advantage of an error by third baseman Ryan Zimmerman. Michael Bourn used his speed to score without a ball being hit out of the infield, and Uggla came through with his two-out hit.	Cory Gearrin, Luis Avilan and Chad Durbin each worked a scoreless inning to close it out for Atlanta.	The Nationals are still in fairly comfortable position, but the Braves are at least making the leaders sweat a bit.	"Just turn the page," Gonzalez said. "I still feel confident with my team."	More noteworthy for Atlanta, the sweep came after three straight losses in Milwaukee rekindled memories of last year's collapse. The Braves maintained a seven-game lead over the second wild-card spot, held by St. Louis, and are eight games up on the next club in the race, the Los Angeles Dodgers. It would take a more epic meltdown than even 2011 to squander that advantage with only 15 games to go.	"Playing this kind of baseball gives us a chance to achieve the goal we set in spring training, and that's to play in a World Series," said Jones, who is retiring after the season.	Gonzalez was trying to become the first 20-game winner for the Montreal-Washington franchise since Ross Grimsley in 1978, when the team called Canada home. But the Braves ran up his pitch count by showing patience at the plate, making it difficult for him just to get through the required five innings.	The left-hander struggled into the sixth, but was lifted after Jones led off with a walk and Freeman doubled. Craig Stammen got out of the mess. Uggla popped out, David Ross struck out and Andrelton Simmons ended the threat with a weak grounder to second base.	"Obviously Gio had a little problem locating the strike zone," manager Davey Johnson said. "He had a whole bunch of pitches but I wanted to give him every chance to win 20."	The Braves blew it open the next inning, using Bourn's speed and Zimmerman's fielding blunder. Bourn walked with one out, then Reed Johnson hit a chopper to third that bounced off Zimmerman's left arm. The ball deflected a few feet away into foul territory, while Zimmerman looked around desperately, unsure where it was.	He finally spotted it, but not quick enough to get Bourn hustling into third. Sean Burnett came on to face Jason Heyward, who grounded to Adam LaRoche at first base. He stepped on the bag and quickly threw home, but it was a bit up the line, allowing Bourn to slide around the tag. After Jones was walked intentionally and Freeman was hit by a pitch, Uggla drove in two more runs with a single to left.	"We had three tough at-bats when Stammen came in, and mine was probably the worst," said Uggla, who swung at a 3-0 pitch that was probably ball four. "It was awesome to get another opportunity -- and especially to come through."	It began raining midway through the game, and there was a slight delay after the sixth while the grounds crew feverishly worked on the mound and around the bases, smoothing out some dry dirt. The showers passed, and the game went on without any further delays.	Game notes	 Nationals 2B Danny Espinosa was lifted for a pinch-hitter in the ninth because of lingering weakness in his left shoulder. The shoulder has been bothering him for about a week, and he's scheduled to see a doctor on Monday, when Washington is off. ... The Nationals outhit the Braves 6-5. ... Atlanta will travel to Miami on Monday to begin a three-game series with the Marlins. Tim Hudson (14-6) goes against Miami's Wade LeBlanc (2-4).

Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO --  Alex Rios went barreling into second base with a hard slide that teammate Gordon Beckham said might be the biggest play of the season for the White Sox as they try to win the AL Central.	Rios was trying to break up a double play and when he went into Detroit second baseman Omar Infante, it caused an errant throw that allowed the tying and go-ahead runs to score Monday as the White Sox beat the Tigers 5-4 and went up three games in division.	"That's a situation where every second baseman knows we're coming in hard. And it was a clean slide, and we took advantage of that," Rios said. "We scored two runs on that play and ended up winning the game, so it was a big play."	The game had been postponed by rain last Thursday and Monday's makeup was the final meeting of the season between the two front runners in the division.	Detroit won the season series 12-6 and captured nine of the final 11 games between the teams, including two of three last week before the four-game series finale was postponed.	Each team has 16 games remaining. Chicago heads to Kansas City and Anaheim to finish out this week while Detroit goes home to face the Athletics and Twins.	"There is still a lot of time left for both teams. ... We just got to continue to grind and hope that what we do every day, day in and day out, is enough," Beckham said. "This is probably still going to go down to the wire."	Rios' fifth-inning slide was the talk of the locker room after the game as was Chicago's bullpen that pitched five scoreless innings after starter Jose Quintana struggled.	"That was a tough play for that second baseman to make that turn. I've been there before," Beckham said. "It's everything you can do to just get it off. What a great slide and I just told him (Rios) that might be the play of the year so far. Pretty special."	When Dayan Viciedo hit a one-out grounder to short, the Tigers tried to turn the inning-ending double play, but  Rios' slide forced an errant throw from Infante that got by Prince Fielder as two runs scored, giving Chicago the lead. And then the bullpen held it.	"Rios got down there pretty good, we just didn't get the turn. Maybe if (Infante) could have come across the bag more," Detroit manager Jim Leyland said. "It was a tough double play. Rios got down there. When he hit it, I thought it was a sure double play."	Infante, who also made a costly error last Monday that helped the White Sox to a win, said he was spiked on the play by Rios, but offered no excuses.	"It's hard to do. It's hard to throw once he hit me," Infante said.  "I have to make the throw. I feel bad because I've made a lot of errors knowing the team needed different."	Nate Jones (8-0) pitched 2 2/3 innings of one-hit relief and the White Sox won their fourth straight. Addison Reed, the last of three relievers in the ninth, got the final out for his 27th save in 31 chances.	Trailing 4-3, the White Sox loaded the bases for a third straight inning in the fifth, driving out Detroit starter Doug Fister (9-9).	Delmon Young drove in three runs for the Tigers with a pair of singles, but Detroit couldn't hold on to an early 3-0 lead. Tigers pitchers walked six and hit two batters.	Chicago loaded the bases again in the eighth and was on the verge of adding an insurance run when Adam Dunn hit a fly ball to left with one out. But before Beckham could cross the plate, Dewayne Wise was thrown out trying to go from second to third -- a double play that ended the inning. It ended up not costing the White Sox.	"I made a mistake there, I'll be the first guy to tell you. I almost blew it right there," Wise said. "I've been playing this game too long to make a mistake like. I'm just thankful that we pulled it out."	Neither starter got out of the fifth. Quintana, who beat the Tigers a week ago in his previous start, gave up seven hits and four runs in four. And Fister, who defeated the White Sox last Tuesday, gave up eight hits and five runs -- four -- earned, also in four innings.	Avisail Garcia, Gerald Laird and Austin Jackson hit consecutive singles to open the third for a 1-0 Detroit lead. After a sacrifice, Quintana intentionally walked Miguel Cabrera to load the bases. He then struck out Prince Fielder, but Young hit a two-run single to put the Tigers up three.	The White Sox had three singles off Fister to load the bases in the bottom half but the 6-foot-8 right-hander struck out Kevin Youkilis and Dunn to end the threat. Chicago tied it in the fourth when Beckham was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded and Wise had a two-run single.	Cabrera led off the fifth with a double and Fielder was ruled safe at first when Dunn fielded his grounder and flipped to Quintana covering. Chicago manager Robin Ventura came out for an explanation from first base umpire Mike Muchlinski and replays appeared to show that Quintana beat Fielder to the bag by a step.	Young followed with another RBI single to put the Tigers ahead 4-3.	Game notes	 Young, who had seven RBIs when the Tigers swept a series from the White Sox earlier this month in Detroit, has 28 RBIs in 40 games at U.S. Cellular Field. ..  Tigers C Alex Avila was out of the starting lineup after colliding with Fielder on Sunday chasing a pop in Cleveland. He got a headache after batting practice. ... Wise was the White Sox's leadoff hitter a second straight game with Alejandro De Aza sitting out. Ventura said De Aza had been a bit out of sync.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

NEW YORK --  Cliff Lee toed the rubber, went through a full windup and simulated a pitch -- toward second base, that is.	Naw, he didn't do that because the Philadelphia Phillies have been stuck in reverse lately. It's a quirk of his, something he started in the minors to stay loose and visualize positive results.	Lee struck out 10 while outdueling Cy Young contender R.A. Dickey, and the Phillies regained their winning touch by beating the New York Mets 3-1 Monday night.	"He controlled the game, he was that good," Philadelphia manager Charlie Manuel said.	Jimmy Rollins homered with the help of video replay and Domonic Brown also hit a solo shot off Dickey (18-6). The Phillies pulled within 3 1/2 games of idle St. Louis for the second NL wild-card spot, though other clubs are also in their path.	"It was a big win. We're kind of running out of games," Lee said. "Three or four teams ahead of us that we've got to catch and pass. Definitely not where we want to be."	Philadelphia had lost three of four at last-place Houston before arriving at Citi Field, where visiting teams have feasted. The Mets have dropped nine of 10 overall, and fell to 4-22 at home since the All-Star break.	"We bounced back tonight," Manuel said. "You get that kind of pitching, it's not that hard."	Lee (6-7) turned in his fifth straight sharp start, winning four of them, and allowed seven hits over eight innings. He was in control, as always, with one walk. He has gone 14 consecutive outings with no more than one free pass.	The 33-year-old lefty trotted to the mound to start his innings, and often was the first Phillies player to take his position. That's when he'd go through his unusual routine, making phantom pitches toward second base.	"In the minors, I usually was the first person out there and that's when I started doing it," he said. "Now, I do it all the time. It's my thing."	Lee, who earned his elusive first victory of the season on July 4 at Citi Field, became the latest pitcher to shut down the Mets in their own ballpark. New York has scored three runs or fewer in a team-record 14 straight home games.	"The way that he has been throwing the last month, month and a half, you knew it was probably going to be a tight game," Dickey said. "The margin of error decreases when he's pitching."	Jonathan Papelbon worked the ninth for his 35th save in 39 chances.	Dickey missed a chance to tie Washington's Gio Gonzalez for the major league lead in wins, and has lost two decisions in a row for the first time this year. Dickey projects to get three more starts this season.	The knuckleballer allowed three runs, two earned, on five hits and two walks in seven innings. He struck out eight -- he has 205 this year, one behind NL leader Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers -- and lowered his ERA a tad to a league-best 2.67.	Dickey's signature floater was fluttering from the get-go. His first pitch of the game eluded catcher Mike Nickeas and went to the backstop, and his second pitch sent a swinging Rollins to his knees.	Rollins eventually struck out, but reached on Nickeas' passed ball. Dickey made a wild toss on his fourth pickoff try to first base and Rollins later scored on Chase Utley's sacrifice fly.	Rollins hit a drive over right fielder Scott Hairston's outstretched glove at the top of the wall in the fifth and pulled into third base with an apparent triple. After a brief look at the replay, the umpires waved him to the plate. Rollins has 21 home runs this year, six this month.	Brown led off the seventh with his fourth homer. He tripled earlier.	The Mets nicked Lee in the fifth. Nickeas put down a perfect bunt on the first pitch and the backup catcher hustled for a single. Dickey sacrificed and Daniel Murphy blooped a two-out single for a run.	That was all for Dickey and the Mets.	"You feel for him, because all he's done is given himself a chance to win a baseball game," Mets manager Terry Collins said. "We'll go back at the end of the year and recount the number of games where he didn't get a decision, or he's allowed us an opportunity to win, and hopefully it doesn't get back to bite him too bad."	Game notes	 The Phillies are 6-10 against the Mets this year. ... Dickey has thrown an NL-high 212 innings this year. He is the first Mets pitcher with 200 strikeouts since Johan Santana in 2008. ... The Mets have lost 10 straight series openers at home. ... The last team to score three runs or fewer in more consecutive home games than the Mets was Seattle, which went 16 in a row in 2010. ... The Mets' Triple-A affiliate will move from Buffalo to Las Vegas for the next two seasons. Toronto is set to switch its top farm team from Las Vegas to Buffalo. Collins says hitting stats at high altitude in the Pacific Coast League "can be a little deceiving." ... A few rows of temporary seats were added in foul territory, next to the backstop. It's a test for when Citi Field hosts the All-Star game next year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MIAMI --  Dan Uggla got Atlanta started with his bat. His glove helped finish off his former club.	Uggla hit a three-run home run in the first inning and sprawled to snare a ground ball that ended a Miami threat in the eighth, Martin Prado tied a career best with four hits and the Braves beat the Marlins 7-5 on Monday night.	It was the fourth straight win for Atlanta, which moved within five games of idle Washington in the NL East.	"Three-run homer, but for me Danny saved us defensively," Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "Here's a guy that gets a bad rap at times defensively, and he saved the game for us today making a bunch of plays."	It was Uggla's first three-RBI game since Aug. 15. Uggla has 13 RBIs in 12 games against Miami this season, more than anyone else has managed against the Marlins.	And even though Miami's current stadium was never his home -- he played up the road at Sun Life Stadium when he was a Marlin -- Uggla clearly still has good feelings when he returns to South Florida.	Uggla has seven homers in 72 games this season at his home park, Turner Field. He's homered three times in only six games at Marlins Park.	"The fans here, I had a great relationship with them," Uggla said. "I felt like they liked the way I played, enjoyed and appreciated the way I played down here. It's always fun to come back and play in front of them."	Tim Hudson (15-6) allowed a season-high 10 hits in five innings, still beating the Marlins for the fifth straight time. Atlanta -- which swept a three-game series from Washington over the weekend -- moved within five games of the idle Nationals in the NL East.	Gorkys Hernandez had his first three-hit game for Miami, the rookie's average going from .157 to .178. Bryan Petersen and Hernandez hit consecutive triples in a four-run fourth inning for Miami.	Miami was without right fielder Giancarlo Stanton, out because of muscle soreness in his rib cage. Chipper Jones got the night off for Atlanta and Prado went 4 for 4 playing third base in his place, including an RBI single in the eighth.	"We battled. We make this game pretty fun," Marlins manager Ozzie Guillen said. "We went out and didn't give up. We battled back against good pitching. We just had one bad inning with a bad pitch to Uggla."	Craig Kimbrel gave up a one-out single to Miami's Jose Reyes in the ninth, but escaped for his 37th save in 40 chances.	The Braves wasted little time against Marlins starter Wade LeBlanc (2-5), getting four hits and four runs in the first. Prado's RBI single opened the scoring, and Uggla followed that with his 19th homer of the season.	"That was just a mistake," LeBlanc said. "I tried to go away and left it middle. To a hitter like that, you can't afford to do that."	Miami had two runners on while trailing by two in the eighth, when Petersen hit a grounder into the hole between first and second. Uggla got to the ball, then scrambled to make the throw to first just in time and end the inning.	For a while, it didn't seem as if such defensive heroics would necessary. Jeff Baker and Hudson had RBI singles for Atlanta in the fourth, pushing the lead to 6-0.	"We kind of let them back in the game a little bit," Gonzalez said.	The Braves came into the night 50-0 when scoring at least six runs.	The Marlins, apparently, weren't deterred.	And for a welcome change -- at least from the Miami perspective -- some home-field advantage helped the Marlins get back into the game.	A night after John Buck flied out to the deepest part of cavernous Marlins Park for the final out of Miami's 5-4, 11-inning loss to Cincinnati -- it prompted plenty of discussion in the team's clubhouse Monday about whether the fences are too far from home plate -- the huge outfield gaps played a big role in Miami rallying.	The pair of triples got Miami right back into things. Petersen's came first, bringing home Donovan Solano and Rob Brantly, and the next by Hernandez allowed Petersen to jog home and cap a four-run outburst that cut Atlanta's lead to 6-4.	"We get a big lead, I'm not really trying to go to the corners with a big lead like that," Hudson said. "You've got to tip your hat to those guys. They hit some pretty decent pitches, I think."	Miami got within 6-5 in the seventh, Carlos Lee's single bringing home Reyes, who hit a one-out double.	Game notes	 LHP Paul Maholm (12-10) pitches for Atlanta on Tuesday night against Miami RHP Nate Eovaldi (4-12). A marquee pitching matchup awaits Wednesday, when Kris Medlen (8-1, 1.62) goes for the Braves against the Marlins' Josh Johnson (8-12, 3.81). ... Stanton, who leads the Marlins with 34 home runs, said he first felt the side-muscle issue on Saturday. Guillen said he'd rather sit Stanton for a couple days than have him miss the rest of the season, and indicated he would be evaluated Tuesday. ... The Braves sat C Brian McCann (knee soreness), though Gonzalez hopes he can play Tuesday. ... Braves RF Jason Heyward made a running catch of a sinking liner to end the fifth inning and save a run.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  The Tampa Bay Rays are slipping out of playoff contention and tempers are getting a little short.	Jacoby Ellsbury homered and drove in three runs, Aaron Cook stopped his five-game losing streak and the Boston Red Sox beat the sliding Rays 5-2 on Monday night.	Tampa Bay, coming off a 1-5 road trip to Baltimore and New York, fell 5½ games behind the AL East-leading Yankees. The Rays also dropped five games back of the Orioles, who won 10-4 in Seattle, for the second AL wild-card spot.	"We're going to have to find a way to bounce out of it," said Tampa Bay center fielder B.J. Upton, who had three of the team's six hits.	The Rays have scored just 21 runs over the last seven games.	"This has been ongoing. ... This is a seasonal misadventure," manager Joe Maddon said of his club's struggling offense. "We've been able to remain solvent because our pitching has been so good."	Tampa Bay leads the AL with a 3.27 ERA. The last five AL teams to finish a season with an ERA as low as the Rays' current figure all advanced to the World Series.	Rays starting pitcher Alex Cobb and catcher Jose Molina got into a heated discussion in the dugout after the top of the sixth when Boston took a 2-1 advantage. There was a wild pitch and passed ball during the inning.	"We're both really into that game, and we needed to win that game," Cobb said. "I honestly don't really know what the argument was about, still. We'll work things out. We'll talk about it tomorrow, or whatever, and leave it behind us."	Molina declined to comment as he was leaving the clubhouse.	"I'm not unhappy," Maddon said. "That's overblown sometimes. That can actually be a good thing. It's fine right now. We discussed everything. It's all good."	Ellsbury hit a two-run homer in the sixth and added an RBI single during a three-run seventh for the Red Sox, who were eliminated from playoff contention Sunday. Cook (4-10) allowed one run and five hits over six innings in his first win since Aug. 6.	Rays slugger Evan Longoria was out of the starting lineup because of what Maddon called heavy legs. Maddon expects the third baseman, who missed 85 games earlier this season due to a partially torn left hamstring, to be back in the lineup Tuesday.	Cobb (9-9) allowed one baserunner -- a two-out walk in the second to Jarrod Saltalamacchia -- through five innings. The right-hander made a nice defensive play to end the second, grabbing a hard grounder by Ryan Lavarnway and throwing the catcher out at first.	Jose Iglesias was hit by Cobb's pitch with one out in the sixth and scored on Boston's first hit of the game, a two-out, two-run homer by Ellsbury that put the Red Sox ahead 2-1.	"For five innings it looked like we didn't have any gas in our tank, and then Iggy ignited us a little bit," Red Sox manager Bobby Valentine said. "And Ells took a lot of time in between pitches and hit a 3-1 pitch, and he gave us the lead."	Cobb was pulled after James Loney singled and Saltalamacchia walked to start the seventh. Boston loaded the bases with no outs when Lavarnway reached against Burke Badenhop after shortstop Ben Zobrist misplayed a grounder for an error.	After pinch-hitter Mauro Gomez hit a two-run single off J.P. Howell, Ellsbury made it 5-1 with a run-scoring single against the Tampa Bay left-hander.	"We played really well tonight, and it's nice to shake hands after a game," Cook said.	Boston is 14-30 since Aug. 1.	Cobb, who had won five consecutive decisions, gave up four runs and two hits in six-plus innings.	Tampa Bay took a 1-0 lead in the fifth when Luke Scott scored from third on Ryan Roberts' sacrifice bunt. Zobrist had an RBI grounder in the ninth.	Game notes	 The announced attendance was just 11,722. ... Ellsbury has seven RBIs over his last nine games. ... Tampa Bay OF Sam Fuld, who left Sunday's game with a strained right hamstring, is expected to be out several more days.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CHICAGO --  Kevin Correia figured the hitters would be anxious after waiting around for nearly four hours.	He was right.	Correia pitched seven innings of two-hit ball and Starling Marte hit a two-run triple to lead the Pittsburgh Pirates past the Chicago Cubs 3-0 Monday night in a game that was delayed more than 3½ hours by rain.	With the Pirates still in playoff contention, the teams waited out two storms at Wrigley Field that pushed back the start for 3 hours, 37 minutes. The first pitch was thrown at 10:42 p.m. CT, and Joel Hanrahan delivered the final one at 1:28 a.m. on Tuesday.	"In a game that starts at 10:40, the hitters are going to be aggressive," Correia said. "It's not going to be a game where you take a lot of pitches, so if you can pound the zone with quality pitches, you're going to have a decent outing usually."	Pittsburgh tied Milwaukee for third place in the NL Central at 74-72. Both teams are 2½ games behind division rival St. Louis for the second NL wild-card spot, with the Los Angeles Dodgers also in their path.	Correia (11-9) walked one and struck out six, equaling a season high. He whiffed the first four batters he faced and matched his longest outing of the season.	"You can argue this is the best game he's pitched all year -- the length, the efficiency, a couple double plays, a couple minor jams he worked right through and out of," Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said. "Very good command. It was the start we needed, a very good outing by Kevin."	Jason Grilli pitched a hitless eighth and Hanrahan got three outs for his 36th save in 39 chances. Darwin Barney had both of Chicago's hits.	"You can chalk it up to maybe sitting around all day waiting," Cubs manager Dale Sveum said. "Both teams it seemed were in a daze out there."	The Pirates touched up Cubs starter Travis Wood for three runs in the third inning, including Marte's key triple. Jose Tabata drove in Marte with a double to deep center.	Clint Barmes was hit by a pitch and Brock Holt's single up the middle on a 3-2 count sent Barmes to third. After Correia was called out on strikes, Marte tripled to left.	The rookie has tripled in three consecutive games.	"They come in bunches," Hurdle said. "I think the young man has an opportunity to possibly lead the league in triples someday. That's just a lot of usable speed out there. That's the biggest swing of the night for us."	Wood (6-12) worked 5 2/3 innings, giving up four hits. He walked one and struck out a career-high nine.	Hurdle said his team stayed relaxed during the rain delay by watching videos and the Broncos-Falcons NFL game.	"We had plenty of time on our hands," Hurdle said. "We made good use of it.	"Most of these guys know, you're playing 20 (games) in 20 (days). There's no days off. They're not going to reschedule unless the weather just goes way bad. You're here for a while. Professionally, they just settled in and just waited to play."	Pittsburgh loaded the bases with two outs in the sixth, but reliever Michael Bowden retired Holt on a grounder.	Trying to play spoiler and avoid a 100-loss season, the Cubs (58-89) had won seven of eight.	"These guys started talking about it a couple of weeks ago, about (not) losing 100 games. That's their motivating factor, as well as all of us, because nobody wants to be associated with that," Sveum said before the game. "To be able to sit back and knock people out of the playoffs or knock them one game less, that's (also) what you get motivated (for) in September when you're out of it."	Game notes	 Pittsburgh returns home to host Milwaukee on Tuesday night. A.J. Burnett (15-7) faces Brewers ace Yovani Gallardo (15-8). ... The Cubs host NL Central-leading Cincinnati beginning Tuesday night, and Sveum said he doesn't want the Reds to clinch the division title this week at Wrigley Field. "Nobody wants anybody to clinch on your turf, that's for sure," Sveum said. "It's inevitable that they'll end up clinching, you just don't want them to do it at your place." ... Wood had struck out eight batters three times. ... Barney extended his career-best hitting streak to 12 games with a second-inning single. ... Bryan LaHair has received limited playing time since the arrival of 1B Anthony Rizzo from the minors. Sveum said LaHair's best bet is to play in the offseason. "I think for his sake he needs to go play winter ball and get those at-bats he missed out on and be ready for spring training like he was this year," Sveum said. ... Pirates 2B Neil Walker was out of the starting lineup. Walker played in the previous three games after missing 15 because of lower back pain. Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said Walker needed a day to rest. ... The State College Spikes, the Pirates' short-season Class-A affiliate, announced a two-year player development contract with the St. Louis Cardinals.

SEATTLE --  Chasing their first playoff berth in 15 years, the Baltimore Orioles are getting contributions from everyone on the roster.	Nate McLouth provided a quick start with a leadoff home run and the Orioles beat the Seattle Mariners 10-4 Monday night to tighten the AL East race.	Matt Wieters hit a two-run homer and Adam Jones scored four times for the Orioles, who moved within a half-game of the first-place New York Yankees. Baltimore also opened a three-game cushion over the Los Angeles Angels for the second AL wild-card spot.	"Just like scoring in a lot of innings, it's just the pass-the-baton mentality," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. "I think the pitchers feel the same way, too. They're staying focused for these nine innings, they turn the page, then there's the next nine innings."	Chris Tillman (8-2) allowed one run and three hits over six innings, supported by Baltimore's 15 hits. He struck out four and walked none.	"We're all clicking right now," Tillman said. "We're going on all cylinders, playing good baseball. It's fun to watch."	Jones and Tillman were two of the five players Seattle sent to the Orioles in a lopsided trade for left-hander Erik Bedard in February 2008. The right-hander is 4-0 with a 0.98 ERA in four career starts against his former club -- and 11-17 with a 5.44 ERA against everyone else.	Tillman came out of his previous start Sept. 2 after three innings because of an inflamed nerve in his right elbow. He had three bullpen sessions since then and said he felt fine.	"He's done well, period," Mariners manager Eric Wedge said. "He's pitched well this year but, yes, he has pitched well against us, too. He's kind of short arm, over the top, a little bit sneaky, real good breaking ball. Then he mixes in his changeup a little. He did a nice job."	McLouth, Wieters and Jones had three hits apiece. Mark Reynolds added two RBIs, and Jones' four runs set a season high for a Baltimore player.	For the second consecutive game, seven players had at least one RBI for the Orioles.	Baltimore has not finished higher than third place since the team won the AL East in 1997. The Orioles had 14 straight losing seasons until this year.	The Mariners scored all their runs on homers. Michael Saunders hit an opposite-field shot, his 16th, to left in the second off Tillman. Eric Thames hit his eighth off Zach Phillips in the eighth and John Jaso had a two-run drive, his ninth, off Luis Ayala in the ninth.	The Orioles jumped on starter Hector Noesi (2-12) from the first batter and didn't let up until they chased him after just 1 1/3 innings.	McLouth opened the game with a home run into the right-field seats on an 0-2 pitch. Reynolds and Manny Machado each had an RBI single later in the first.	J.J. Hardy and Reynolds each had a run-scoring double in a four-run second, and Jones added an RBI single. Another run scored on an error for a 7-0 lead.	"It's everyone picking the next guy up," Reynolds said. "We need guys to get hot right now to stay in this race. The Yankees aren't going anywhere. Oakland is a good team. Tampa Bay is right there. The Angels are a really good team. We have to take care of our own by winning games. Whether it's Wieters or Jonesy or someone else, everyone has to step up."	Noesi gave up eight hits and six earned runs in his 54-pitch outing. He walked two and struck out one.	"Hector has to be better than that," Wedge said. "It just wasn't a good day at all for him."	Wieters hit a two-run homer to center in the fourth on the first pitch from Oliver Perez. It was his 22nd, tying his career high.	Endy Chavez finished the Orioles' scoring with an RBI single in the sixth.	"That's impressive, our production around," McLouth said. "Definitely not counting on one or two guys alone is pretty important."	Game notes	 The Orioles have won six of seven meetings with the Mariners this season. ... Showalter said he's "pleasantly surprised" that OF Nick Markakis does not need more surgery on his injured right thumb. Markakis was hurt Sept. 8 and was given a six-week timetable for a return. It's unlikely he'll be available unless the club advances well into the playoffs. ... Orioles RHP Jason Hammel, who came out of his start last Tuesday with a knee issue, is progressing slowly, according to Showalter. It's uncertain when he will start again. ... Baltimore RHP Miguel Gonzalez likely will start Friday in Boston. ... Wedge started his regulars. "We are going to put out our best lineup," he said. He added that his players are doing more than just showing up. "No one is looking at the finish line right now," he said. "I don't sense that at all. They're all focused on today."	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Brandon Crawford's bat is finally catching up to his glove, and both are peaking at just the right time for the San Francisco Giants.	Crawford tripled, doubled and scored on a passed ball in another highlight-filled game defensively, and Hunter Pence singled home the go-ahead run in the sixth inning to lead the Giants past the Colorado Rockies 2-1 on Monday night.	After Crawford's error-filled start to the season, Giants manager Bruce Bochy feels the shortstop's first full season in the majors might be Gold Glove worthy. Crawford entered the game with a .985 fielding percentage since the All-Star break, second-best among National League shortstops.	"I don't know who is playing better defensively," Bochy said. "I don't. We talked about his start. He has confidence going and a sense of belonging. He's done a great job."	Madison Bumgarner (15-10) allowed one run and four hits in six innings while walking a career-high five, gutting out a start in which he said his "mechanics were probably the worst they've been all year." The lefty struck out six and relied on a strong defensive effort to extend San Francisco's lead to a season-high eight games over the idle Dodgers in the NL West.	"That feels better to win a game like that when you're really sharp," Bumgarner said.	Pence's RBI single off reliever Guillermo Moscoso (3-2) handed Colorado its 10th loss in 12 games.	Rockies starter Jhoulys Chacin gave up five hits and a run in five innings. He also doubled and scored on Josh Rutledge's triple in the fifth.	Four relievers held Colorado scoreless before Sergio Romo struck out pinch-hitter Jason Giambi for his 12th save in 13 chances, helping San Francisco open a 10-game homestand by winning for the fifth time in six games.	Buster Posey went 2 for 4 and threw out Dexter Fowler at second in the first inning, backing Bumgarner's first win in five starts. And while Bumgarner hardly looked sharp at the start, walking four of his first 11 batters, he pitched out of jams and allowed his defense to do the rest.	Crawford dug out a ball deep in the hole and threw across his body to get Jordan Pacheco at first base for the second out of the third.	"It's a play that we practice every once in a while," Crawford said. "Even just kind of messing around sometimes because it's a tough play to make."	In the bottom of the inning, Crawford hit a leadoff triple off the top of the wall in center and scored on catcher Wilin Rosario's 20th passed ball of the year to give San Francisco a 1-0 lead.	With the Rockies doing little to back Chacin, the pitcher helped his own cause when he doubled and scored on Rutledge's two-out triple in the fifth.	Crawford doubled leading off the San Francisco fifth and tried to score when Angel Pagan singled, but was cut down at home on left fielder Andrew Brown's one-hop throw.	Pence's single in the sixth scored a tumbling Pablo Sandoval from second to put the Giants ahead 2-1 and runners on the corners with no outs. Moscoso got Brandon Belt and Xavier Nady to pop out and struck out Crawford, pumping his fist in celebration while walking off the mound.	"There are no moral victories, OK?" Rockies manager Jim Tracy said. "But when you look at the fact that we had six or seven rookies on the field tonight. ... With these young people, they're going to make mistakes and we know that. It's never good to lose, please don't misunderstand what I'm saying, but when you have young people involved in games like this, there's one (heck) of a learning point there."	The momentum never carried over.	Rockies slugger Carlos Gonzalez was out of the starting lineup with a sore left hamstring after cramping a day earlier, and Colorado's offense showed little pop in his absence. Left-hander Javier Lopez got the pinch-hitting Gonzalez to ground out for the second out of the ninth.	Bumgarner had walked four batters four times previously, twice this season. Guillermo Mota, Jose Mijares and Santiago Casilla combined for 2 1/3 innings of hitless relief.	Game notes	 Nady returned to left field for the first time since he injured his left hamstring running for a ball in the gap against Arizona on Sept. 5. He finished 0 for 3. ... Rockies LHP Jorge De La Rosa will start against the Giants on Thursday in his first major league appearance since Tommy John surgery last year, manager Jim Tracy said. LHP Drew Pomeranz's start has been pushed back to Friday against Arizona, and Alex White will move to the bullpen for now. ... Giants OF Gregor Blanco sat out with a sore left shoulder. He is day to day. ... The Giants send Tim Lincecum (9-14, 5.09 ERA) to the mound against Rockies LHP Jeff Francis (5-5, 5.68) on Tuesday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CLEVELAND --  Darin Mastroianni and the Minnesota Twins hustled to an extra-inning win.	Meanwhile, Matt LaPorta and the Cleveland Indians stood and watched another disheartening loss.	Mastroianni scored the go-ahead run from second base on an infield hit in a two-run 12th inning and the Twins beat Cleveland 6-5 on Tuesday night, tying the Indians for fourth place in the AL Central.	"A win's a win," said Minnesota manager Ron Gardenhire, pleased with the final result yet disappointed with some mistakes that let Cleveland get back into the game.	"We gave it away a little bit early," Gardenhire said. "They had chances, we had chances. Then our bullpen was super, we got a couple key hits late and were fortunate to get the win."	Mastroianni singled with two outs and stole second off Scott Maine (1-1), the team-record 10th pitcher used by Cleveland. Alexi Casilla then poked a ball between first and second that second baseman Jason Kipnis fielded in short right. But Casilla was safe when LaPorta, the first baseman, fielded Kipnis' throw, but was not on the bag. LaPorta had broken to become a cutoff man, then held the ball before reacting too late to throw out Mastroianni at home.	"That's a big mental mistake there," Indians manager Manny Acta said.	Mastroianni gambled that Casilla was going to make contact.	"I was running as soon as he swung because Alexi handles the bat well," he said. "I got to third and the coach said keep going. Then I just had to get to the plate before the ball did.	"I didn't think it was hit hard enough to get into right field, but I wasn't sure if (Kipnis) bobbled it or what happened."	It was Mastroianni's third aggressive move of the game. Two of them worked. He entered in the eighth as a pinch-runner at second base and was promptly eliminated on a scorching one-hopper hit to pitcher Vinnie Pestano.	"I was not happy with that at all," Mastroianni said. "Vinnie made a great play to get the ball, but it doesn't matter. I was overly aggressive there.	"Then in the 12th, I just took off for the steal. That was a gamble going, because if (Maine) steps off, I'm done."	Gardenhire didn't question any of Mastroianni's moves.	"He's aggressive; that's what he brings to the team," Gardenhire said. "Pestano made a great play, but the aggressiveness won the game in the end."	Tyler Robertson (2-2) pitched 1 1/3 innings for the win. Glen Perkins worked the 12th for his 12th save.	Pedro Florimon singled home an insurance run later in the 12th. It was needed as Carlos Santana hit his 16th homer in the bottom half to get Cleveland within 6-5.	The Indians had runners on the corners with no outs and eventually loaded the bases in the 10th, but didn't score as they dropped to 11-38 since July 26.	"If you can't drive in the runner from third with no outs to walk off a team, you pretty much don't deserve to win the ballgame," Acta said.	The Twins broke a three-game losing streak and improved to 7-3 in extra innings.	Joe Mauer and Denard Span both had three hits for the Twins, who have won 11 of 14 from Cleveland since the Indians took the first three meetings this season.	Mauer went 3 for 4 with two walks four his fourth consecutive multihit game. He is hitting .325 and continues a late-season surge for a fourth AL batting title. Detroit's Miguel Cabrera started the day at .330, followed by Mike Trout of Los Angeles at .329.	Span opened the game with a double to right off left-hander David Huff and took third on Ben Revere's bunt single. Mauer singled home Span and Revere scored on a sacrifice fly by Justin Morneau -- his 20th RBI against Cleveland this season, tying Harmon Killebrew's team mark set in 1962 for the most against the Indians in a season.	Cleveland cut it to 2-1 in the bottom half on an RBI groundout by Asdrubal Cabrera.	Lonnie Chisenhall tied it at 2 with a 428-foot homer into the Indians' bullpen in the second, but Eduardo Escobar's RBI groundout put the Twins ahead 3-2 in the fourth.	Cleveland loaded the bases on three singles against starter P.J. Walters in the sixth. Brian Duensing came on and struck out Chisenhall, then gave up two runs.	One scored when third baseman Trevor Plouffe misplayed a line drive by Casey Kotchman for an error. Ezequiel Carerra put Cleveland ahead 4-3 with a run-scoring groundout, hustling down the first-base line to beat the relay throw and avoid a double play.	Minnesota tied it at 4 on Josh Willingham's RBI single in the seventh.	Huff gave up seven hits and three runs over 4 1/3 innings in his first start. He had pitched twice in relief since being recalled from Triple-A Columbus, beating the Twins with 3 1/3 scoreless innings on Sept. 7.	Walters allowed four runs -- two earned -- over five innings.	Game notes	 The teams threw 374 pitches and the game lasted exactly 4 hours. ... Cleveland had used nine pitchers in a game in 1971 against Washington and 2006 against the Twins. ... Indians LHP Rafael Perez has been shut down for the season with left shoulder inflammation. He has been out since April. ... Acta expects DH Travis Hafner (lower back) to play this week. Hafner has been out since Aug. 6. ... Twins RHP Matt Capps (shoulder) is expected to pitch in the Instructional League. ... The Twins are expected to announce Wednesday they are switching their Class A affiliate in the Midwest League to Cedar Rapids (Iowa) next season after eight years in Beloit (Wis.).	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

DETROIT -- Miguel Cabrera is making a late push for the Triple Crown -- and if he keeps swinging like this, the Detroit Tigers could still have a shot in the AL Central.	Cabrera homered twice, including a grand slam in the eighth inning, and the Tigers routed the Oakland Athletics 12-2 on Tuesday night. Detroit lost right-hander Max Scherzer after only two innings to fatigue in his throwing shoulder, but an MRI revealed no structural damage.	The Chicago White Sox beat Kansas City to remain three games ahead of Detroit atop the division, taking something away from Cabrera's big night.	"Our job is to win games. There's no talk about personal numbers," Cabrera said. "Hopefully we can get a good winning streak."	Cabrera now leads the American League with a .333 average and 129 RBIs. He also has a career-high 40 homers -- two behind Josh Hamilton for the top spot.	The last Triple Crown winner was Carl Yastrzemski in 1967.	"That's a hard thing to do. You've got to be lucky," Cabrera said. "Hopefully we get lucky in our division and win more games."	Prince Fielder and Jhonny Peralta added home runs for the Tigers. Darin Downs (2-1) pitched 2 2/3 scoreless innings for the win in relief of Scherzer.	Oakland rookie A.J. Griffin (6-1) lost for the first time in his career.	"Just wasn't executing pitches the way I usually do," Griffin said. "Wasn't pounding down in the zone, leaving pitches up and they capitalized on it."	Scherzer entered the game with a major league-leading 220 strikeouts and added four more to that total before leaving after only two innings. He's expected to go a couple days without throwing, then be evaluated again.	"I didn't have any pain in my shoulder -- it was just like my arm was dead," Scherzer said. "MRI came back negative. All the structural -- it's all good."	After a gut-wrenching 5-4 loss to the White Sox in Chicago on Monday, the Tigers were back home, where they've now won 27 of 35. They'll play their next nine games at home before going on the road for the final six.	Griffin was the only pitcher since at least 1918 to allow three runs or fewer and walk two batters or fewer in each of his first 11 career starts. That streak came to an end Tuesday. He allowed five runs and eight hits in 4 2/3 innings, walking one and striking out three.	Oakland took the lead in the first on an RBI single by Brandon Moss, but Detroit answered immediately with Cabrera's sacrifice fly.	Peralta gave the Tigers a 2-1 lead in the second with his 12th homer of the year, and Cabrera hit a solo shot of his own the following inning.	Fielder's 27th homer of the year -- a two-run shot in the fifth -- made it 5-1, and the A's never made much progress against the Detroit relievers. Oakland came in three games behind first-place Texas in the AL West, but leading the wild-card race. This 10-game swing to Detroit, New York and Texas is their last trip of the regular season.	Austin Jackson hit an RBI double in the sixth for Detroit, and Quintin Berry added a two-run double to make it 8-1. Berry left in the top of the seventh with a right shoulder contusion after a diving attempt to catch Josh Reddick's double. X-rays were negative.	Reddick scored on a single by Yoenis Cespedes.	Oakland outfielder Coco Crisp started after having been out since Saturday. He'd missed time because of an allergic reaction in his left eye, and he left this game in the fourth because of complications to an existing eye infection.	Detroit added four more runs in the eighth on Cabrera's grand slam. Oakland reliever Jesse Chavez was then ejected for hitting Fielder with a pitch.	Game notes	 Detroit C Alex Avila did not play and is day-to-day. He's still recovering after colliding with Fielder on Sunday chasing a pop in Cleveland. He's been bothered by headaches. His replacement, Gerald Laird, had three hits. .. Moss had three hits for the A's. ... Detroit RHP Justin Verlander (14-8) takes the mound Wednesday night against Oakland LHP Brett Anderson (4-1).	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

PITTSBURGH --  The Milwaukee Brewers have wheels.	On the basepaths, and in the standings, too.	Ryan Braun hit two hits, drove in a run and collected three of Milwaukee's seven stolen bases in a 6-0 romp over the weary Pittsburgh Pirates on Tuesday night.	"I think people have always perceived us as a team that relies on the home run," Braun said. "Well, we really don't. We're pretty good at running the bases."	Then again, just about everybody is against the Pirates.	Pittsburgh entered the night throwing out less than 10 percent of attempted base stealers on the season, by far the lowest in the majors. The number only got worse as the Brewers went 7 for 7 to post their highest single game steals total since moving to the National League in 1998.	"We've got a lot of guys who can steal bases, and if you rely on the homer, you really get yourself in trouble, so you try to find a way to manufacture runs sometimes, too," Braun said.	Not that streaking Yovani Gallardo (16-8) requires much in the way of run support these days.	The right-hander gave up two hits over 6 2/3 innings to win his eighth straight decision. Milwaukee moved in front of fading Pittsburgh in the jumbled National League wild-card race and remained 2 1/2 games back of St. Louis for the second wild-card spot.	"Yo's on a roll that he goes out there and he throws up a lot of zeroes," said Milwaukee manager Ron Roenicke.	Carlos Gomez and Jonathan Lucroy had three hits apiece for the Brewers, who trailed the Pirates by nine games during their last visit to PNC Park but are peaking heading into the final two weeks of the season.	"We just continued to believe, continued to stay positive," Braun said. "I think with the second wild card, it gives everybody hope."	A.J. Burnett (15-8) gave up two runs in six innings but couldn't stop Pittsburgh's late season swoon. The Pirates are 4-12 this month.	"He really wrestled out there," said Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle. "He gave it everything he had."	Even if it wasn't enough for Burnett to become the first Pirates pitcher to win 16 games in 20 years. He shook off trouble in the first two innings -- when he needed 51 pitches to get six outs while giving up a run -- to pitch into the sixth for his 25th straight start.	Pittsburgh took the field less than 24 hours removed from a long night in Chicago, where the Pirates waited out a rain delay of more than three hours before scratching out a 3-0 victory over the Cubs. The team didn't get into Pittsburgh until 5:40 a.m., and Hurdle let his players arrive later than usual to the ballpark after the on Tuesday. The extra rest didn't help.	Gallardo has thrived as the team's No. 1 starter since Zack Greinke was traded to the Los Angeles Angels and had little trouble extending his hot streak against the Pirates.	The Brewers escaped a bases-loaded two-out jam in the second when Gallardo got Burnett to ground out to second.	Pittsburgh didn't get another base runner until the seventh, and by then Milwaukee had raced to a 4-0 lead.	The night followed a similar theme. The Brewers would get on base with a single -- all 13 of their hits were singles -- then move into scoring position by taking off for second at the first opportunity.	Eventually, the greed turned into runs.	During one sequence in the seventh, Weeks singled with one out then stole second and raced home on a single by Braun. The reigning NL MVP then stole second and came home on a single up the middle by Lucroy to make it 4-0.	"I think they were good times to go, and we have the opportunity anytime we're on second base, we get that base hit and we got a few of them," Roenicke said. "So it was a good game."	Pittsburgh briefly had a chance to get back in it in the bottom of the inning, using a single, an error and a walk to load the bases. Gallardo gave way to reliever Jim Henderson, who got pinch-hitter Michael McKenry to pop to shallow right field.	Milwaukee tacked on two more runs in the eighth, sparked by a single and stolen base by Gomez. It was the seventh of the night for the Brewers, the most since the club joined the NL and the second most in team history. The team record for stolen bases in a single game is eight set against the Toronto Blue Jays on Aug. 28, 1992.	Hurdle had no issue with the liberties the Brewers took on the base paths.	"If you don't like'em stealing bases," Hurdle said, "get'em out."	Game notes	 The series continues on Wednesday with Milwaukee's Marco Estrada (3-6, 3.77 ERA) facing Pittsburgh's Kyle McPherson (0-0, 1.54 ERA), who will be making his first major league start ... The Pirates reached a two-year agreement with the Jamestown Jammers of the New York-Penn League for the 2013 and 2014 seasons.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

MIAMI --  The Miami Marlins endured a miserable ninth, then came through again in extra innings.	Miami blew a late three-run lead, then bounced back when Jose Reyes hit a two-out RBI single in the 10th to snap the Atlanta Braves' four-game winning streak with a 4-3 victory.	The last-place Marlins improved to 11-5 in extra-inning games; they are 55-78 otherwise.	"We played them strange and then we win and it's all fine," Miami manager Ozzie Guillen said. "Oh boy, what a way to do it."	With one out in the 10th, pinch-hitter Rob Brantly was walked by Cory Gearrin (0-1), and Gorkys Hernandez was hit by a pitch. Following a strikeout, Reyes hit a blooper that fell in front of a diving Jason Heyward in right field, and Brantly scored without a play.	"Reyes just happened to put some bat on a ball and bloop one in there," Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez said.	John Buck hit a two-run homer, tripled and scored twice for Miami. Heath Bell (3-5) pitched a perfect 10th.	Atlanta lost to Miami for only the fourth time in 14 meetings.	The Braves rallied from a 3-0 deficit in the ninth to tie the game. Heyward doubled to start the inning against Steve Cishek, and Chipper Jones walked on a 3-2 pitch. With one out, Dan Uggla singled home a run, and Brian McCann followed with a two-run double off Mike Dunn to tie the score.	Dunn struck out Michael Bourn with runners at the corners to end the inning.	"We fought back to tie it up," McCann said. "All you can ask is for everybody to play hard. That's what we did, and it didn't go our way."	The Braves' rally spoiled a career-best outing by Miami's Nate Eovaldi. He allowed no runs and only four hits while pitching eight innings for the first time.	Eovaldi, a 22-year-old rookie, had lost his last four starts and came into the game with the lowest winning percentage of any NL pitcher at 4-12. But he permitted just two runners to reach second base.	"He was throwing 97 (mph), 98 even in the eighth inning, and he was commanding," Gonzalez said. "Nasty."	"A very spectacular game for him," Guillen said. "No doubt this kid has a good arm."	The Braves were so flummoxed by Eovaldi that slugger Heyward bunted with two outs and none on in the sixth. He reached on a single but was stranded.	Atlanta's Paul Maholm allowed four hits and two runs in 6 2/3 innings.	The game began with the retractable roof open for the eighth time this season, and the first since June 13. The roof was closed when light rain began to fall in the fifth inning.	Buck hit his first triple of the season in the third inning and scored on a two-out single by Hernandez. Center fielder Bourn misplayed Buck's deep drive, pulling up short of the wall near the 418-foot sign and then leaping in vain for the ball.	"I think he went so far back that he felt like the wall had to be close there, and it kind of threw him off," Gonzalez said.	The Marlins added two runs in the seventh. Austin Kearns doubled with two outs, and Maholm was replaced by Peter Moylan, who gave up Buck's 11th homer.	The Marlins played without slugger Giancarlo Stanton, who missed his second consecutive game with a strained muscle in his side. He's expected to rejoin the starting lineup Friday.	Game notes	 Braves SS Paul Janish dislocated his left shoulder diving for an infield single in the ninth inning. He said he doesn't think he'll be sidelined for long. ... McCann was back in the lineup after missing two starts with right hamstring tendinitis. ... RHP Josh Johnson, scheduled to start Wednesday against Atlanta, is 6-4 with a 2.17 ERA in 18 games against the Braves. ... OF-1B Logan Morrison is the Marlins' nominee for the Clemente Award, which recognizes the player who best represents the game through positive contributions on and off the field. ... Brantly, a rookie C who threw out a base stealer for the first time in his career Monday, sheepishly admitted he missed a pickoff sign from the dugout before the pitch. "He's a kid," Guillen said. "He does stuff that makes you laugh."	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  The Tampa Bay Rays are running out of explanations for a skid that has them sliding out of playoff contention.	"I don't have anything brilliant to say," manager Joe Maddon said Tuesday after the Boston Red Sox rallied for a 7-5 victory that dealt another blow to his team's bid to earn a postseason berth for the fourth time in five years. "We're just not playing well and we've got to figure it out relatively quick -- not relatively quick, very quickly."	Felix Doubront limited Tampa Bay's sputtering offense to one hit over six innings and Jacoby Ellsbury, Dustin Pedroia, James Loney, Jarrod Saltalamacchia and Ryan Lavarnway drove in runs for the last-place Red Sox, who beat their AL East rivals for the second straight night.	The third-place Rays have lost four straight and dropped six games behind the division-leading New York Yankees, who were rained out Tuesday.	Five Boston pitchers held the Rays to three singles. The Rays also hurt themselves by committing three errors for the second straight night.	Maddon, however, isn't questioning the team's effort. The Rays made the playoffs as division champions in 2008 and 2010 and rallied from a big deficit in September to earn a wild-card spot on the final night of last season.	"I don't get frustrated or annoyed when the effort is good. It's more unexplainable because we normally thrive in these moments and we're playing kind of tight," the manager said.	"We're playing uptight, we're Jonesing out there a little bit. I don't understand why because I really believe we've maintained the clubhouse in the same fashion that we normally do," Maddon added. "This time of the year is the time I thought we really enjoy the most, and for whatever reason it's just not thriving or happening right now."	Doubront (11-9) settled down after a shaky third inning when he loaded the bases on three walks before yielding a two-run single to Ben Zobrist and Evan Longoria's sacrifice fly. The left-hander walked five and struck out five, ending a stretch in which he went 0-5 over eight starts dating to late July.	The Red Sox, who already have been eliminated from playoff contention, scored a run in the fourth and two more in the fifth. They took the lead with an unearned run off Kyle Farnsworth (1-6) in the sixth, then tacked on three more in the seventh when Saltalamacchia had an RBI single and Lavarnway followed with a two-run double off Wade Davis.	The Rays lost for the seventh time in eight games despite four RBIs from Zobrist, who added a two-run single off Junichi Tazawa in the seventh to help Tampa Bay pull within 7-5. The runs were charged to Clayton Mortensen, who loaded the bases with two outs when he hit Carlos Pena with a pitch and walked the next two batters.	Andrew Bailey pitched the ninth for his fifth save, completing a three-hitter.	"It's frustrating," Tampa Bay's B.J. Upton said. "You really can't say much more than that."	Doubront earned his first victory since July 18, when he beat the Chicago White Sox.	The lefty walked Sean Rodriguez, Desmond Jennings and Upton to load the bases with one out in the third, then watched all of them score on Zobrist's first hit and Longoria's fly ball to left. He eventually got into a groove and retired 11 of his last 12 batters, limiting the Rays to a one-out walk in the fifth.	"He deserved to win," Red Sox manager Bobby Valentine said. "He had that third inning. A couple calls that he got upset with. Three runs later he's on the verge of coming out of the game. Then he got his 11th win. I'm really happy for him. He's been trying for that one for a long time."	Tampa Bay starter Jeremy Hellickson allowed three runs and five hits in four-plus innings.	Loney singled in a run in the fourth, and the Red Sox chased Hellickson when Jose Iglesias walked and Pedro Ciriaco and Ellsbury singled to begin the fifth. Ellsbury's hit trimmed Tampa Bay's lead to 3-2 and Boston pulled even on Pedroia's sacrifice fly off Jake McGee.	Boston broke the tie on a throwing error by Rodriguez, filling in at third base for Longoria, who served as the designated hitter.	A year after finishing with a major league-low 73 errors, the Rays have 109 with 14 games remaining.	"I don't see fatigue out of the players or pitchers," Maddon said. "We're just not playing well right now."	Game notes	 Longoria, who missed 85 games earlier this season due to a partially torn left hamstring, returned after sitting out Monday to rest his legs. Maddon said he may play in the field for the remainder of the four-game series. ... Boston bench coach Tim Bogar is scheduled to interview Wednesday for the open Houston managerial position. "I hope it works well for him," Valentine said. ... Red Sox RHP John Lackey (right elbow surgery) threw batting practice and is scheduled to pitch Sunday in an instructional league intrasquad game in Fort Myers.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

CHICAGO --  Dusty Baker and the Cincinnati Reds moved one step closer to the NL Central title on Tuesday night, thanks to another solid September start by Homer Bailey.	The right-hander pitched effectively into the eighth inning and Ryan Hanigan hit a three-run double to lead Cincinnati to a 3-1 victory over the Chicago Cubs.	"We had just enough offense to win," Baker said after his 3,000th game as a big league manager. "That was a big double by Hanigan. Just a big victory for us, back to 30 over and one step closer."	The Reds (89-59) have a magic number of four to clinch the division championship over St. Louis. The Cardinals beat Houston 4-1 on Tuesday night.	Bailey (12-9) took a two-hit shutout into the eighth before Darwin Barney had his second single of the night and pinch-hitter Bryan LaHair hit an RBI double to make it 3-1. Sean Marshall then came in and hit pinch-hitter Dave Sappelt before getting a strikeout and grounder to end the threat.	Jonathan Broxton worked a perfect ninth for his third save in five chances with Cincinnati, which acquired him in a July 31 deal with Kansas City. The big right-hander has recorded 11 consecutive scoreless appearances, allowing just five hits and converting each of his three save opportunities during the streak.	Bailey allowed four hits, struck out four and walked two while improving to 2-0 with a 1.55 ERA in four starts this month. He is 3-0 against the Cubs this season and 5-2 for his career.	"Once we scored those three runs, I really put a lot of effort into putting up some zeroes," Bailey said. "Really wish I could have finished that eighth. I threw a pretty good pitch, LaHair just went down there and got it. Nothing you can really do about that."	Cubs starter Justin Germano was working on a shutout before he was pulled after he walked the first three batters in the sixth -- Joey Votto, Ryan Ludwick and Jay Bruce. Manny Corpas came in and Hanigan hit a drive to right-center with one out that cleared the bases.	"I had bases loaded, let it come to you in that situation. Just trying to put the ball in the outfield and fortunately it got over their heads," Hanigan said. "It worked out."	"You got three quality veteran hitters up there and after seeing him that was their third time, I think they kind of waited him (Germano) out," Cubs manager Dale Sveum said. "We got the out and just couldn't get the ball on the ground with Corpas. Hanigan obviously put a nice swing on the ball that changed the whole game around."	Germano (2-8) lost his sixth straight start. He gave up three hits, walked five, hit two batters and threw a wild pitch.	"I don't think I've ever walked the bases loaded before in my professional career, so that was a first and pretty much the worst time to ever do that," Germano said. "I was just missing and they were good takes on their part."	Game notes	 Baker said he had no special desire to clinch the division at Wrigley Field, where he managed the Cubs for four seasons, got them within five outs of the World Series in 2003 and was not brought back after the 2006 season. He said he just wanted to clinch as soon as possible and it doesn't matter where. ... Monday night's game between the Pirates and Cubs was delayed by storms for 3 hours, 37 minutes. The first pitch was thrown at 10:42 p.m. CDT and the game ended at 1:28 a.m. Tuesday night's game lasted 2 hours, 51 minutes. ... Sveum said 2B Darwin Barney, who has stretched his errorless streak to an NL-record 133 straight games, is a core player for the future because his defense is a game-changing skill. Barney also has a 13-game hitting streak ... Game 2 of the series on Wednesday night pits the Reds' Mike Leake (8-9) against Chris Rusin (1-2).	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Gavin Floyd is healthy again and hoping to help the Chicago White Sox get back to the playoffs.	Floyd pitched seven crisp innings, Alex Rios hit a tiebreaking homer in the seventh and the White Sox beat the Kansas City Royals 3-2 on Tuesday night for their fifth consecutive win.	Alejandro De Aza and Gordon Beckham also went deep for AL Central-leading Chicago, which maintained a three-game advantage over Detroit and improved to 6-10 against the Royals. Chicago had lost seven of eight against Kansas City.	Floyd (10-10) gave up two runs in the first inning and nothing after that. He allowed five hits, walked one and struck out three, throwing 52 strikes in 78 pitches.	The 6-foot-6 right-hander was making his second start since coming off the disabled list after being sidelined with an elbow flexor strain. He also missed time earlier in the year with right elbow tendinitis.	"I felt good out there," he said. "I just wanted to make as few pitches out there and let the defense work. It's great especially after sitting for 15 days and more than that before. It's nice to get back out there and just be part of the team and contribute."	Floyd reached double figures in victories for the fifth consecutive season as the White Sox (81-66) moved 15 games above .500.	"We're no way content," Floyd said. "We're content in the place that we are, but there's still a lot of baseball left. It's fun to be in the position we're at. We've just got to keep pushing."	De Aza drove Luke Hochevar's second pitch over the wall in right for his eighth homer of the season. De Aza had been slumping, hitless in his previous nine at-bat and 2-for-21 in his previous five games.	First-year manager Robin Ventura did not play the outfielder in the past two games, but thought the timing was right to get him back in the lineup.	"I know what I'm doing," Ventura joked. "He looked out of synch in Minnesota."	Hochevar (8-14), who is 1-5 in his last nine starts, allowed just one single the next four innings before Beckham led off the sixth with his 16th home run. Beckham is hitting .333 with four home runs and 14 RBIs in his past 17 games.	"He's in a better position to hit," Ventura said. "He's more confident. He's getting his hands back and getting through it. He's hit some homers, but for me he's keeping the ball on a line a little bit more than he has all year long."	The White Sox upped their home run total to 198, which ranks second in the majors. They have 13 homers in their past 14 road games.	"I'm not going to be critical how we get them," Ventura said. "This is a big ballpark. You've got to find a way to get some runs other than just sitting back and waiting for a home run. I'm glad we hit them, but this isn't a ballpark you can sit back and do that."	Rios' 24th homer came with one out in the seventh and matched his career high. Rios also played a key role in Chicago's 5-4 win over Detroit on Monday when he broke up a potential double play with a hard slide that led to an errant throw that allowed the tying and go-ahead runs to score.	Hochevar allowed seven hits in seven innings. He struck out four and walked none.	Kansas City got off to a fast start when Billy Butler hit a two-run single in the first inning to give him a career-high 97 RBIs.	The Royals did not have a baserunner after Jeff Francoeur's fourth-inning double.	"He (Floyd) settled in really nice," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "They retired our last 16 batters. We had trouble centering anything up against them."	Matt Thornton retired all four batters he faced. Addison Reed got the final two outs for his 28th save in 32 chances.	Royals RHP Luis Mendoza has strep throat and will miss his scheduled Wednesday start against the White Sox. LHP Bruce Chen will be moved up a day, while RHP Jeremy Guthrie will start Thursday. ... The White Sox announced LHP Francisco Liriano will start the Thursday series finale against the Royals. ... Royals LF Alex Gordon threw out A.J. Pierzynski trying to stretch a single into a double in the fifth inning. Kansas City leads the majors with 44 outfield assists.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ST. LOUIS --  St. Louis Cardinals manager Mike Matheny believes Kyle Lohse belongs in the NL Cy Young conversation.	Helping the World Series champions get to the postseason will do for now.	The right-hander threw seven scoreless innings for his 15th victory and contributed an RBI double as the Cardinals beat the Houston Astros 4-1 Tuesday night to stay in front for the second NL wild card.	"He was in position to have many more wins than 15 right now," Matheny said. "He's thriving on being that guy for us, to really set the bar for the rest of the starters.	"If we would have been able to hold some of the leads that he had, there's no question he'd be right at the top of that mix," Matheny added.	Fernando Abad (0-5) had a career-best six strikeouts in the Astros' 100th loss. They're 8-8 this month under interim manager Tony DeFrancesco and need nine wins in the final 14 games to avoid topping last season's franchise-record 106 losses.	DeFrancesco is hindered by a roster filled with prospects.	"When I got the job it was already where it was at," DeFrancesco said. "We know what's on the field. We know what direction the team is going, and we're excited about our future."	Excited about Wednesday, too.	"We know what's on their mind over there, to get that second wild-card spot," cleanup man Justin Maxwell said. "If we can do our job and win games, we can definitely be the spoilers."	Daniel Descalso got a key early RBI and Jon Jay had two hits and two RBIs for the Cardinals, coming off a 2-5 trip. But they have a favorable upcoming schedule with the next eight against lowly Houston and Chicago. With 14 games to play, the defending World Series champions are 1 1/2 games ahead of the Dodgers, rained out at Washington, and 2 1/2 games ahead of the Brewers.	Lohse (15-3) matched his season best for victories set in 2008 with St. Louis, on his fourth attempt while stranding two runners in the third and seventh. A .281 career hitter entering the season, he raised his average this year to .100 with his third RBI on a bouncer over drawn-in third baseman Matt Dominguez.	It was hit first extra-base hit since a double Sept. 19, 2011, at Philadelphia off Roy Halladay.	"That looked like a Hall of Fame swing, didn't it?" Lohse joked. "It says .100 up there and I'm just glad it's there instead of lower.	"A positive thing is when it's in the 80s it doesn't go down much every time you make an out."	Due for free agency after the season, Lohse leads the majors with a winning percentage of .833 and is among the National League leaders with a 2.71 ERA.	"It's easy to just concentrate on what I'm doing," Lohse said. "I try to take that focus every fifth day. If I'm worried about numbers, what could have been, or ... contracts, none of that matters to me."	Abad allowed three runs in five innings, the longest of his five career starts -- all this year -- and is 1-10 with a 5.12 ERA in parts of three seasons with Houston. Brett Wallace had an RBI single off Mitchell Boggs in the eighth.	The Cardinals had four extra-base hits, three of them in succession with one out in the fifth. Pete Kozma tripled, Lohse doubled and Jay doubled to make it 3-0.	They missed a chance for more when Carlos Beltran struck out and Jay was thrown out at third. It was the second time one of St. Louis' best hitters whiffed in the clutch and Astros catcher Jason Castro turned it into a double play. Matt Holliday struck out and Jay was thrown out at second to end the first.	Yadier Molina singled with one out in the second and scored on a two-out single by Descalso, who had been batting just .104 with runners in scoring position (8 for 77) on the year and was 1 for 16 on the trip. Descalso batted .294 with runners in scoring position as a rookie.	"We saw last year that guy can produce in those situations," Matheny said. "It's just a matter of trusting himself, getting a couple to fall in for in for him and hopefully he goes on a tear."	Jason Motte worked the ninth for his 36th save in 43 chances.	Game notes	 RHP Chris Carpenter threw in the bullpen and remained on track to make his first start of the season Friday at Chicago. Carpenter underwent surgery to relieve nerve compression in his shoulder in late July and at that time had been hopeful of pitching next year in the final year of a two-year contract. ... Lance Lynn (15-7, 3.95) faces Lucas Harrell (10-9, 3.86) in the second game of the three-game series Wednesday night. ... Rams DE Robert Quinn threw out a ceremonial first pitch. ... RHP Jake Westbrook, who has missed one start with pulled side muscle, played catch Monday and could return well before the end of the regular season. ... Lohse is 10-8 against Houston and has not allowed more than three runs in any of his 18 career starts against the Astros.  ... The Cardinals are 28-17 against left-handed starters.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

PHOENIX --  A 30-pitch first inning did not doom Ian Kennedy's start against San Diego.	Far from it.	The Arizona right-hander found his rhythm, carried it through eight innings and the Diamondbacks finally got a home victory over the Padres, 3-2 on Tuesday night.	"When that happens, you've got to be really efficient as the game goes on and try to go as deep as possible," Kennedy said of the high early pitch count. "I was really happy that Gibby (manager Kirk Gibson) allowed me to go into the eighth. He asked me how I felt and I said I felt pretty good, so he said all right."	Kennedy (14-11) scattered seven hits, striking out six and walking two, one intentionally. A 21-game winner in 2011, he is 8-3 in his last 12 starts.	"He's aggressive now. You see his velocity up. In the last inning he was throwing 90-91 (mph)," said catcher Miguel Montero, who drove in two runs with two doubles. "And his command, his command on his secondary stuff, he's been able to throw it for a strike. That's big. It's not like they're just sitting on fastball because he can't locate a breaking ball. Right now he can throw every pitch for a strike."	San Diego, which lost for just the third time in 12 games, was 6-0 in Arizona this season before dropping the series opener. The Diamondbacks stayed 4½ games out in the wild-card race with just 15 to play.	Eric Stults (6-3) gave up three runs and five hits in six innings in his first loss since June 3. The left-hander had gone 5-0 with a 2.08 ERA in seven starts since rejoining the Padres rotation on Aug. 6.	"Stultsy did fine," San Diego manager Bud Black said. "A little bit of an elevated pitch count, which is something he hasn't done. He has been very efficient and throwing the ball well.  He gave up three runs and I am sure he wishes he had a couple of pitches back, some breaking balls that stayed up in the zone.  He threw well enough to keep us in the game. Their guy just outpitched, bottom line."	The Padres got a run in the ninth inning after Chris Denorfia singled and reached third when the ball got past Adam Eaton in center field for a two-base error. Will Venable's sacrifice fly brought Denorfia home but J.J. Putz retired Jesus Guzman and pinch hitter Mark Kotsay to earn his 30th save in 35 opportunities.	Kennedy, pitching on an extra day's rest, struck out seven, two in his final inning. He walked two, one intentionally. His 121 pitches were one shy of his season high.	Stults struck out six, walked three and hit a batter. The last time he faced the Diamondbacks, at Arizona on Aug. 29, Stults blanked the Diamondbacks on three hits over seven innings.	"They had a little different approach," he said. "They were sitting off-speed tonight, especially early in the count. The first two times I faced them I was able to get ahead early (because) they were more a little more aggressive early in the count."	Arizona center fielder Chris Young, in the lineup for the first time since Sept. 3, aggravated his right quadriceps injury running down a fly ball for the first out of the game.	"Extremely frustrating," Young said. "I've been practicing every day and you put in a lot of work to get back to right. Game speed's just a little different, so as soon as I had to turn it up, it grabbed on me, and it's time to start from scratch again, it seems like."	When Young left the game, Eaton shifted from left to center, and Gerardo Parra came in to play left.	After the substitution, Logan Forsythe singled and Chase Headley walked, then Yasmani Grandal singled off the glove of Kennedy to load the bases. Yonder Alonso hit a sacrifice fly to left. Parra's throw reached home ahead of the runner, but Forsythe slid under the tag of the catcher Montero, who did not block the plate.	The Diamondbacks responded with two runs in the bottom of the first. Eaton led off with a walk, stole second, and, with two outs, scored on Paul Goldschmidt's single. Goldschmidt scored from first when Montero doubled to right.	Arizona added a run in the fifth when Justin Upton drew a one-out walk and raced home from first on Montero's double high off the wall in center.	The Diamondbacks had runners at first and third with one out in the seventh, but Padres shortstop Everth Cabrera fielded Goldschmidt's grounder, spun around as he touched second, then fired to first for the inning-ending double play.	Eaton has reached safely in 10 of his first 11 major league games. Parra is the only Arizona player to reach safely in his first 11 big league contests.	Game notes	 In their two three-game sweeps in Arizona, the Padres outscored the Diamondbacks 42-20. ... Arizona's top minor league club, the Reno Aces, won the Triple-A championship 10-3 over Pawtucket on Tuesday night. Two other D-backs minor league teams, Double-A Mobile and Rookie League Missoula, won their league titles. ... In Game 2 of the series on Wednesday night, the Diamondbacks go with RHP Trevor Cahill (11-11, 3.92 ERA) against the Padres' RHP Edinson Volquez (10-10, 4.24). ... Phoenix Suns guard Goran Dragic will throw out the first pitch at Wednesday night's game.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Jered Weaver spent a long stretch of his 100th career victory in the batting cage and the tunnel below Angel Stadium, playing catch to keep his arm warm while the Los Angeles Angels batted around in an eight-run fourth inning.	Weaver didn't lose his rhythm, and the Angels kept flowing toward a playoff berth.	Weaver pitched seven innings of six-hit ball in his 18th win of the season, Chris Iannetta had a two-run single and scored on a wild pitch during that crazy rally, and the Angels moved up in the AL postseason race with an 11-3 victory over the Texas Rangers on Tuesday night.	Weaver (18-4) gave up third-inning homers to Mike Napoli and Ian Kinsler, but got a huge cushion from his teammates to ease into a tie with Tampa Bay's David Price for the AL lead in wins. The ace right-hander, who has spent his entire career in Anaheim, matched his single-season high for victories and became just the sixth pitcher to win 100 games with the club.	"It's an honor to do it all in an Angels uniform," said Weaver, a Los Angeles-area native. "I wouldn't have it any other way. Hopefully these fans see 200 more, but I don't know. We'll see what happens."	What's happening on the scoreboards is more interesting to Weaver and his teammates at the moment.	Erick Aybar had three hits and scored two runs for the Angels (81-67), who moved within 3½ games of wild card-leading Oakland with their 15th win in 20 games after the Athletics (84-63) lost at Detroit. Los Angeles also kept pressure on Baltimore, which sits in second place in the AL wild-card standings.	"We're at the point in the year when we just have to win," Iannetta said. "We need to find a way. Texas, Oakland, Baltimore, they're all in the drivers' seat, but we've been on a real good three-week stretch. We just have to keep working."	Los Angeles trimmed its deficit behind the AL West-leading Rangers (87-60) to 6½ games, but the Angels are much more focused on making a late wild-card push -- and with a few more innings like the fourth, they might have an outside shot.	Los Angeles sent 12 batters to the plate in the fourth while carving up three Texas pitchers, including starter Ryan Dempster, during its biggest rally in nearly two months.	"It felt like a rain delay out there," Weaver said. "But when runs are coming across the board, you can't complain too much."	With eight Angels scoring a run, they had no trouble producing offense in the absence of Albert Pujols, who missed the game to be with his wife and their newborn daughter. The Angels expect Pujols to be back in the lineup Wednesday.	Dempster (6-2) was charged with five runs and six hits in 3 1/3 innings, ending his five-start winning streak with his second rough outing against the Angels. The veteran has yielded 13 earned runs to Los Angeles and just 15 to the rest of the AL during his nine starts for Texas.	"It got out of control," Texas manager Ron Washington said. "We just couldn't get any outs. Dempster struggled from the beginning. It was a fight the whole time, and in that fourth inning, they just took the game away from us."	All-Star Josh Hamilton left in the fourth with sinus trouble that affected the slugger's vision, Washington said. Napoli had two hits in another big game against his former teammates, but Weaver and two relievers largely shut down the majors' most potent offense.	Kinsler ended an 0-for-11 skid with just his second homer in 17 games, but the Angels got rolling in the fourth. After Vernon Wells and Alberto Callaspo reached, Iannetta cracked a one-out single off the bottom of the right-field wall before Mike Trout walked to chase Dempster.	Tanner Scheppers then threw two pitches: He hit Aybar with the first to load the bases, and put the second into the backstop for a wild pitch. Iannetta made contact with Scheppers' leg on his slide, leaving Scheppers on the ground in agony while Napoli's throw hit home plate umpire Jim Wolf, allowing Trout to score on a throwing error.	Scheppers left with a bruised right knee, but the Angels didn't let up against Mark Lowe.	Aybar scored on Kendrys Morales' single, a tapper that traveled about 15 feet up the third-base line. Wells and Callaspo then drove in runs before Mark Trumbo made his second out of the inning.	"It was strange and bizarre," Michael Young said. "There were definitely strange things that happened that inning, but the bottom line was that they had some good at-bats and found a way to score. It doesn't matter how it happened. They scored eight."	Game notes	 Hamilton was replaced by Leonys Martin on defense in the bottom of the fourth. The major league leader with 42 homers walked and grounded out in his two at-bats. ... Weaver has never lost a decision to Texas at Angel Stadium, going 9-0. ... RHP Wilmer Font made his major league debut for Texas in the sixth, pitching a scoreless inning.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

SEATTLE --  The Baltimore Orioles weren't going to be denied a victory -- or making history -- even if it took 5 hours and 44 minutes to do it.	Taylor Teagarden stroked a pinch-hit RBI single to right in the 18th inning to help give the Baltimore Orioles a 4-2 comeback victory over the Seattle Mariners on Tuesday night.	The win allowed the Orioles (84-64) to pull within a percentage point of the Yankees (83-63) for the lead in the AL East. The Yankees were rained out Tuesday and will play a split double-header with Toronto on Wednesday.	Baltimore maintained a three-game lead in the wild-card race over the Los Angeles Angels, who beat Texas 11-3 in Anaheim.	The Orioles' success in extra-inning games might be one of the biggest factors keeping them in the playoff hunt. They have won 14 straight extra-inning games for the longest extra-inning win streak since the 1949 Cleveland Indians won 19 straight. Overall, the Orioles are 14-2 in extra-inning games this season, going 9-0 in them on the road.	"It's tough," said Nate McLouth, who had three hits. "When you start going that long, there's a part of you that has to fight the feeling, `Oh, let's just get this game over with.' Especially in the position we're in. It's a really important game. It's hard to stay locked in that long."	McLouth opened the 18th with a walk off Lucas Luetge (2-2). With McLouth breaking toward second, J.J. Hardy sent a single through the right-side hole. McLouth continued onto third.	McLouth said it wasn't a hit-and-run.	"I felt like I could get the bag. He had a strike on him so he swung," he said. "It happened to go in a good spot."	Teagarden then lifted his game-winner down the right-field line. Hardy later scored on Mark Reynolds' fielder's choice.	Tommy Hunter (5-8) picked up the victory. And he did it with a little extra measure of `good luck.' Just before taking the mound in the 16th, one of the hovering seagulls unloaded on his hat.	"Here I was minding my own business," Hunter said. "Guys were dying laughing. Then everyone said it was good luck. Then we won the game."	Jim Johnson worked the 18th to pick up his 44th save -- most in the majors -- in 47 opportunities.	"It's a challenge," Mariners manager Eric Wedge said. "It's a scenario you don't get into too much, but every now and then it happens. It's tough on both sides offensively. Everyone wants it so bad. We had so many opportunities. One more hit and the game's over."	Orioles manager Buck Showalter added, "that dugout was alive the whole time, the whole extra innings."	The Orioles rallied in the ninth off starter Erasmo Ramirez, who had allowed just two hits and was sitting on a 2-0 lead entering the inning. Pinch-hitter Ryan Flaherty and McLouth opened with singles to bring in closer Tom Wilhelmsen.	Hardy dropped a sacrifice bunt to advance the runners. Chris Davis followed with a two-run single to right.	"It tried to be aggressive with the hitters in the ninth," Ramirez said, "just tried to get ahead in the count."	Wei-Yin Chen went 5 1/3 innings, allowing two runs on six hits. He walked two and struck out two.	It's the first time the Orioles have been 20 games over .500 since the last day of the 1997 season.	It was the longest extra-inning game for the Mariners this season. They are 5-8 in extra innings.	Justin Smoak and Dustin Ackley each had three hits for the Mariners.	It appeared that Chen would breeze through the fourth as the first two batters bounced out to the infield. Casper Wells then drew a walk on a 3-2 pitch. Miguel Olivo followed with his 11th home run on a 1-2 curve from Chen, who had started him with four straight fastballs.	Ramirez retired the first nine batters before McLouth's leadoff single in the fourth, just tipping off the glove of second baseman Ackley. Ramirez then retired the next eight straight before McLouth's double to center in the sixth. Center-fielder Franklin Gutierrez caught the ball on a dive but it popped out of his glove on contact with the ground.	Ramirez, recalled from the minors on Sept. 1, matched his career high with eight innings. He allowed four hits and both runs were charged to him. He struck out six and walked no one.	Both catchers, Matt Wieters and Olivo, caught the entire 18 innings.	"This is the first game I catch two games in one," Olivo said.	Showalter said of Wieters: "I can't tell everyone how challenging it is to catch a game like that, make that many decisions and be right so often."	Game notes	 DH Jim Thome (neck) and LHP Troy Patton (ankle) are finishing rehab assignments at the Orioles' Sarasota facility and could rejoin the club this weekend in Boston. "They're both close," manager Buck Showalter said. "We'll make the call (Thursday)." ... RH Miguel Gonzalez and RH Chris Tillman will start in Boston with the third starter to be decided. ... Chen is just the fourth Orioles rookie pitcher since 1954 to make at least 30 starts. He joins Bob Milacki (36 in 1989), Tom Phoebus (33 in 1967) and Brian Matusz (32 in 2010). ... Felix Hernandez was recognized before the game as the Mariners' nominee for the Roberto Clemente Award. "That's a great honor," manager Eric Wedge said. "Felix is the total package. To see what he does off the field, how he carries himself, how generous he is with his time, with people, it's well-deserved." ... RHP Hector Noesi, shelled for six runs and eight hits in 1 1/3 innings Monday, is back in the bullpen for the rest of the season. RH Blake Beavan will fill his spot in the rotation, starting Saturday. ... Michael Saunders was ejected in the 10th inning for disputing a called third strike.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Each time he takes the mound, Tim Lincecum is becoming more comfortable again. More trusting that his command will carry him just like it used to every fifth day.	Lincecum pitched San Francisco one win closer to an NL West crown, and the Giants lowered their magic number to clinch the division to seven with a 6-3 victory over the Colorado Rockies on Tuesday night.	Lincecum (10-14) struck out six and walked two in 6 1/3 scoreless innings on a day the second-place Los Angeles Dodgers were postponed by rain in Washington. He was fighting a constant cough that came on during the weekend in the dry desert air of Arizona.	When Lincecum reached his low point this summer, he started taking a "nothing to lose" approach.	"I know it's been a long year. You never stop working," Lincecum said. "I feel like I'm getting back to that point. I still feel like I'm grinding a little bit, but those harder situations are getting a little bit easier to get out of."	Marco Scutaro had three singles, drove in a run and scored twice and Xavier Nady had two RBI singles for the Giants (85-63), who moved a season-high 22 games over .500. Pablo Sandoval added two hits, including a double, and Hunter Pence added a sacrifice fly.	Wilin Rosario hit a two-run homer off Santiago Casilla in the eighth inning, matching the Rockies' rookie record of 25 set by Todd Helton in 1998.	Angel Pagan extended his own San Francisco record with an RBI triple in the eighth, his major league-leading 14th. He tipped his batting helmet from third base to acknowledge the cheering crowd.	Following a walk to DJ LeMahieu in the second inning, Lincecum retired the next 11 batters in order before Dexter Fowler's leadoff walk in the sixth. What happened next is rarely seen: Fowler was out at second on a fielder's choice as the ball bounced off his batting helmet on shortstop Brandon Crawford's throw to first attempting to get Charlie Blackmon for a double play. Blackmon was then caught stealing.	Lincecum improved to just 4-8 with a 3.67 ERA at home this season, but he sure looked like his old stellar self for a significant stretch on this cool September night -- albeit with three of Colorado's best hitters out injured.	After beating the Rockies last Wednesday at Coors Field, the two-time NL Cy Young Award winner posted consecutive victories for the first time since April 23 and 28. He also won his third straight decision.	"That's the Timmy that we know, and we're going to need him down the stretch," manager Bruce Bochy said. "Timmy's tough when he's on his game, and he's on it right now."	Rookie Hector Sanchez, who has caught Lincecum most of the season, doubled, singled and scored a run. With him behind the plate, Buster Posey started at first base.	When Posey drew an intentional walk in the third, many in the sellout crowd of 41,718 chanted "M-V-P! M-V-P!" He drew another one in the seventh, drawing boos.	Fans jumped to their feet to give Lincecum a standing ovation when he gave way to Jeremy Affeldt in the seventh. Lincecum allowed an infield single to pinch-hitter Josh Rutledge that loaded the bases, then Affeldt got pinch-hitter Jason Giambi to ground into an inning-ending double play.	"They just beat us tonight," Rockies manager Jim Tracy said. "We battled them. We had a great opportunity, as good as you can have, bases loaded, one out in the seventh, and a good matchup for us. We just hit into a double play."	Lincecum became the seventh pitcher in San Francisco history to win 10 or more games in five straight seasons.	Sergio Romo allowed pinch-hitter Matt McBride's two-out RBI single in the ninth for Colorado's last run.	Jeff Francis (5-6) lost consecutive starts for just the second time all season and his winless stretch reached four outings since he beat the Dodgers on Aug. 27.	The lefty matched up against Lincecum for the second time in as many starts. He allowed two runs and six hits in five innings, struck out three and walked one.	Colorado lost for the 12th time in its last 16 games at San Francisco.	Pagan appeared to be ejected by home plate umpire Angel Hernandez when he flipped his bat after a called third strike to end the sixth. Hernandez signaled and an arguing Pagan had to be escorted off the field by Bochy. But he took his position in center field moments later. The hand signal was actually a fine for an equipment violation.	"I thought I got tossed, and I was asking `Why did you toss me?" Pagan said. "I didn't think I did anything wrong. Just three outs, I flipped my bat and was going to flip my helmet and get my stuff to go to center field. It was as simple as that. I wasn't showing anybody up."	Carlos Gonzalez was a late scratch for the Rockies with tightness in his left hamstring. The left fielder tested his leg with some running before the game but didn't feel right. Tracy didn't want to risk further problems by playing the slugger, especially on a night when first-pitch temperature was 58 degrees.	"It didn't go very well," said Gonzalez, who is expected to play Wednesday night in the third game of the four-game series.	Game notes	 Scutaro -- who began the season with the Rockies -- has 52 multihit games, tying him with suspended teammate Melky Cabrera for second-most in the NL. Scutaro has 20 in his last 32. ... Colorado fell to 2-5 at the Giants' waterfront ballpark in 2012. ... Pence has 95 RBIs in all this season and 36 for the Giants, most for the club since he arrived from the Phillies at the trade deadline. ... Matt Cain, who pitched a perfect game June 13 against the Astros, is the Giants nominee for the Roberto Clemente Award. ... Giambi hopes to play in 2013. "If I get a job next year, I'll play," he said. "I hope so."	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

NEW YORK --  Andy Pettitte was a little unsettled by an uncharacteristically thin crowd at Yankee Stadium on Wednesday afternoon compared to the raucous environment found at many of his big September and October starts. Still, the 40-year-old lefty was pumped to finally be back on the mound when it mattered most to his team.	Pettitte pitched five sparkling innings in his return from a broken leg and Ichiro Suzuki made a difficult catch to preserve a lead, keeping New York atop the AL East with a 4-2 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays in the opener of a day-night doubleheader.	"The beginning of the game it was almost like you could hear people talking -- I'm just trying to focus," Pettitte said. "I think for me it probably would've been better if we had a packed house."	Pettitte (4-3) looked his old steely self in giving up four hits in his first September start since 2010. Injured on June 27, the postseason career wins leader boosted the Yankees into a half-game division lead over the pesky Baltimore Orioles.	"When you see these guys go through what they've been going through, and I've been sitting here watching and just trying to cheerlead for them, it's great to be able to go out there and feel like you contributed," he said.	Rafael Soriano escaped a bases-loaded jam in the eighth after Toronto closed to 3-2, and New York extended a winning streak to three for the first time since Aug. 13-15.	In the makeup of a game washed out Tuesday night, Suzuki had three hits batting leadoff as Derek Jeter was given the opener off. Bothered by a sore left ankle, Jeter was expected to start at shortstop for the first time in a week in the nightcap.	Robinson Cano had an RBI double in a three-run first against Henderson Alvarez (9-13) that also included Alex Rodriguez's run-scoring groundout and Curtis Granderson's sacrifice fly.	Pettitte threw 75 pitches in his first start since a line drive off the bat of Cleveland's Casey Kotchman broke his left fibula. Then manager Joe Girardi mixed and matched liberally, using six relievers	Clay Rapada, Derek Lowe, Joba Chamberlain and Boone Logan held Toronto scoreless through seven innings. Then David Robertson gave up an RBI single to pinch-hitter Kelly Johnson and a run-scoring double to Omar Vziquel in the eighth.	"Our bullpen guys understand they can be used at any point," Girardi said.	Soriano relieved with two outs and runners on second and third, then walked Anthony Gose after a foul drive about a foot foul down the left-field line that just missed being a two-run double. Rajai Davis followed with a sinking liner to left field that Suzuki caught against his stomach for the third out.	"I'm glad I don't have a big belly because if I did it might've hit the belly and popped out," Suzuki said through a translator.	Nick Swisher had an RBI single in the bottom half. Soriano pitched a perfect ninth for his 41st save in 44 chances.	Toronto's 45-year-old Vizquel had two hits to move past Babe Ruth for 41st on the career list at 2,874.	"I think when you get a hit to tie one of the best hitters in baseball, it's an amazing feeling. I mean, this guy has been a legend in the game for a long time and, to mention my name right next to his just makes me feel so little," Vizquel said. "I never thought, never, ever, in my career of baseball that's been a long one, that I was gonna come close, to even compare my hits with the Babe. It's just unbelievable. It's very emotional, especially here in New York, the house that he built."	The Blue Jays, playing their first doubleheader against the Yankees since 1986, were without Yunel Escobar, who began a three-game suspension for wearing eye black displaying anti-gay slur written in Spanish during a game last weekend against Boston.	With ace CC Sabathia struggling and the Orioles refusing to lose, the Yankees are looking to Pettitte to help lead them to the playoffs.	Pettitte was in fine form in his return from retirement, going 3-3 with a 3.22 ERA before his injury, and all throughout his rehab for his leg insisted his arm felt good. And he felt that way afterward Wednesday.	"My arm feels great. My break area feels great. I'm a hundred percent," Pettitte said. "Just real happy with how my arm is feeling. More than anything it's my legs. I just got to get my legs back in shape."	Pettitte struggled a bit with his command, walking two, but kept the Blue Jays from hitting the ball hard with a biting breaking ball. He put runners on in each of his first four innings and had runner on third in the second through fourth innings. But he got timely groundouts in the second, third -- a double play -- and fourth to avoid trouble.	"He gave us everything that we asked for," Girardi said.	Game notes	 Robinson has a 7.00 ERA in September. ... Alvarez allowed five hits in seven innings and struck out a career-high seven. ... Toronto DH Edwin Encarnacion (sore right big toe) was not in the starting lineup for the opener. ... The Blue Jays will play another doubleheader Monday, making up an Aug. 26 postponement at Baltimore. They will play nine games in seven days. ... To make room for Pettitte on the 40-man roster, the Yankees recalled RHP Dellin Betances from the minors and placed him on the 60-day DL.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

WASHINGTON --  Nearing their first playoff berth since arriving in Washington, the Nationals scratched out a 3-1 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the opening game of a doubleheader Wednesday, supporting Jordan Zimmermann's six innings of one-run pitching with two RBI groundouts and a sacrifice fly.	The win was the Nationals' 90th, the most for a Major League Baseball club in the nation's capital since 1933 -- also the last time a D.C. team played beyond the regular season.	Pitching on seven days' rest because of Monday's scheduled day off and Tuesday's rainout, Zimmermann (11-8) kept putting runners on base and working around it. He allowed six hits, walked four and hit a batter, but Hanley Ramirez's RBI single in the third produced the Dodgers' only run.	Four relievers followed Zimmermann, combining to allow three hits across four shutout innings. Sean Burnett got out of a potentially troublesome spot in the seventh by striking out Adrian Gonzalez with runners on the corners, and Tyler Clippard pitched the ninth for his 32nd save in 35 chances.	Another victory in the day's second game would allow the Nationals to assure themselves of no worse than a wild-card berth.	But everyone associated with the franchise, which moved from Montreal before the 2005 season, insists the real goal is an NL East division title -- followed by more success in the postseason.	As general manager Mike Rizzo put it Wednesday: "Clinching a playoff berth is just one of the small steps in our grand plan."	The Nationals pushed across runs in the second, fifth and sixth innings. Two came off Dodgers starter Aaron Harang (9-10), who threw 4 2/3 innings and gave up seven hits.	Kurt Suzuki delivered a sac fly in the second, and Washington went up 2-1 in the fifth. Teenager Bryce Harper hustled his way to a triple after lining a ball barely out of the second baseman's reach and to the wall in right-center.	Ryan Zimmerman, who was slated to get a cortisone shot before the game for a bothersome right shoulder, followed with an RBI groundout to bring home Harper.	Harper's triple was his eighth, the most by a Nationals player in a season since the club moved to Washington.	Another RBI groundout, this one by pinch-hitter Tyler Moore, made it 3-1 in the sixth.	Game notes	 Playing two days after getting a cortisone shot for a painful left shoulder, Washington 2B Danny Espinosa made a couple of fine sliding, spinning plays to record groundouts. He also singled in each of his first two at-bats. ... Dodgers LF Shane Victorino stole two bases to raise his season total to 37, tying a career high. ... Nationals manager Davey Johnson said offseason surgery to clean out Zimmerman's shoulder "will definitely be seriously considered." Rizzo said that if Zimmerman does have an operation, "He'd certainly be ready for whenever spring training begins." ... Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said LHP Clayton Kershaw (sore right hip) has started to play catch. Kershaw won't pitch in a game until he throws off a mound, which hasn't been scheduled yet. ... Mattingly said he would have preferred to play at 10 p.m. Tuesday night, if possible, rather than a doubleheader Wednesday. "Trying to win two in one day is tough," he said.

DETROIT --  Detroit manager Jim Leyland had his head on a swivel, looking at reporters when they asked a question one moment and glancing up toward the TV in his office with Kansas City leading Chicago when it got quiet.	"If I didn't have this on, I might as well go home," Leyland said.	The Tigers improved their chances of sticking around beyond the regular season when Miguel Cabrera homered, Omar Infante drove in three runs and Justin Verlander pitched six scoreless innings to help them beat the Oakland Athletics 6-2 on Wednesday night.	The Royals later helped out with a 3-0 win over the White Sox that trimmed their lead to two games over Detroit in the AL Central with 14 games remaining.	The Tigers have won two straight over the A's -- and 28 of their last 36 games at home.	"We played a couple good games against one of the hottest teams in all of baseball," Leyland said. "That's pretty good."	Oakland, clinging to an AL wild-card spot, has dropped three straight and might have had a costly loss on the mound because Brett Anderson (4-2) left the game after two-plus innings with a strained right oblique.	"He's getting an MRI right now," A's manager Bob Melvin said. "So, we won't know anything until he gets back."	Melvin plans to pitch Dan Straily in Anderson's spot in the rotation if he can't make his next start.	The A's forced Justin Verlander (15-8) to throw 122 pitches and that ended his night. He allowed five hits and three walks while striking out five.	"It was a grind," Verlander said.	Octavio Dotel struck out two in a perfect seventh. Joaquin Benoit had two strikeouts in the eighth. Jose Valverde closed the game in a non-save situation, entering with a six-run lead, and was booed after giving up two-out RBI singles to Cliff Pennington and Stephen Drew.	Detroit played some small ball to take a 3-0 lead in the third.	Andy Dirks and Gerald Laird started the inning with bunt singles and advanced on Austin Jackson's groundout. Infante followed with a double down the left-field line to put the Tigers up 2-0.	"Those were two perfect bunts or they would have been outs," Melvin said.	Infante's groundout in the eighth inning gave the Tigers a six-run lead.	After walking Cabrera intentionally and giving Prince Fielder a free pass on four pitches to load the bases, Anderson was injured while pitching to Delmon Young. Anderson fell forward and landed awkwardly after throwing his 48th pitch. Oakland trainer Nick Paparesta and Melvin talked with Anderson briefly on the field before deciding to take him out of the game.	"We could see earlier in the inning that he was trying to stretch out his back, so I don't think the fall had anything to do with it," Melvin said. "We just checked him at that point and decided we didn't want to go any farther with him."	Right-hander Pat Neshek replaced Anderson and Young promptly hit a sacrifice fly to give the Tigers a 3-0 lead.	Detroit shortstop Jhonny Peralta had an error in the fifth -- snapping a 75-game errorless streak -- but he helped turn a double play to end the inning. He chipped in at the plate in the home half, hitting an RBI single to put Detroit ahead 4-0.	Cabrera sent Jim Miller's 94 mph high fastball on an 0-2 pitch over the fence in left field for his 41st home run and 130th RBI to bolster his shot at being baseball's first Triple Crown winner since Boston's Carl Yastrzemski pulled off the feat in 1967.	"It's something that is a dream," Cabrera said. "But right now, I got to focus on trying to help us make the playoffs."	Verlander said it has been "unbelievable," to watch Cabrera this season.	"Obviously, he's got my support for MVP," the reigning AL MVP and Cy Young Award winner. "He's one home run away from the Triple Crown, and that's a rarity in baseball, and that's a testament to how good of a player he is.	"Look at the ball he hit for a home run. We were talking about that, you just don't see that. You execute your pitch, 94 up at his chin, and he hits a home run."	Game notes	 Tigers RHP Max Scherzer hopes to make his next scheduled start on Sunday at home against Minnesota. He left the series opener against Oakland after just two innings because of a fatigued right shoulder. "It wasn't sharp pain, it was weakness," he said. "I need a couple days of not throwing." ... A's OF Coco Crisp didn't play because of infections in both eyes, and Melvin is hoping his contagious ailment doesn't spread. "He's got his own towels," Melvin said. ... Tigers C Alex Avila, still feeling the effects of colliding with Fielder on Sunday, didn't play and the team is hoping he'll return this weekend at home against the Twins. ... Peralta's 75-game scoreless streak was the longest by a position player for the Tigers in a season since at least 1957.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CLEVELAND --  Liam Hendriks finally has a win, thanks in part to another productive night for Josh Willingham.	Willingham had four hits and four RBIs to help Hendriks and the Twins beat Cleveland 6-4 on Wednesday, dropping the Indians into last place in the AL Central.	Hendriks (1-7) allowed two runs and two hits in six effective innings to get the win in his 18th career start. The right-hander was pelted with shaving cream by happy teammates after picking up the elusive win.	"It took a long, long time," Hendriks said. "I could have done without the shaving cream in my eye, but I'm excited to become the 16th Australian to win a major league game."	Minnesota manager Ron Gardenhire couldn't help but tease the 23-year-old pitcher.	"I told him if it takes him that long to win again, the shaving cream is going to be gasoline," Gardenire said jokingly.	Willingham belted a tiebreaking two-run homer off Zach McAllister (5-8) in the fifth inning, giving Minnesota a 4-2 lead. He also had three singles.	Willingham now has 35 homers and 110 RBIs in his first year with the Twins. It's the most homers by a Minnesota player since Hall of Famer Harmon Killebrew's 41 in 1970. His previous career high for RBIs was 98 set last season with Oakland.	"It has been a special year for me," said Willingham, who said he didn't predict any numbers when he moved to Minnesota as a free agent, turning down Cleveland's contract offer last winter.	"To make a long story short, I wanted three years and two teams offered that," he said. "Cleveland was not one of them."	Gardenhire is glad.	"He can put it in the seats and we knew that when we signed him," he said. "He has some big RBIs for us."	Cleveland shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera homered, but left in the seventh with a sore right wrist as the Indians fell to 5-12 against Minnesota. Manager Manny Acta said Cabrera will not play Thursday.	Glen Perkins worked the ninth for his 14th save.	Minnesota's Joe Mauer went 1 for 4 with a walk and had an RBI single taken away when the umpires reversed a call. Mauer is hitting .324 while contending for his fourth AL batting title. Detroit's Miguel Cabrera leads at .333.	Mauer hit a sinking liner to left with Jamey Carroll on second base in the eighth. Vinny Rottino made a diving catch, but third base umpire Mike Muchlinski gave a safe sign as Carroll scored.	Acta argued with Muchlinski, a fill-in ump from the minors. The entire crew huddled for a moment and Muchlinski reversed his call, ending the inning and keeping the score at 6-2.	"I thought I could see he caught the ball," Acta said. "It's always a tough call."	Jason Kipnis and Michael Brantley each singled in runs in the bottom half, but Cleveland fell to 11-39 since July 26. It has dropped 11 of its last 13 at home.	The Indians led the AL Central for 40 days and held a four-game advantage on May 17, but are 39-72 since.	Hendriks, who made four starts in 2011, was the fifth pitcher since 1920 to go winless in his first 17 starts, three shy of the record shared by Bill Caudill of the Chicago Cubs (1979-81) and Mike Mohler of Oakland (1993-97).	"It's nice to get the young man a win," Gardenhire said. "He stayed away from the big inning. Willingham had a heck of a night, but the night goes to Liam."	Cabrera put Cleveland ahead 1-0 with his 15th homer in the first. He later aggravated a wrist injury that caused him to miss four starts last week.	Mauer and Willingham had consecutive run-scoring singles in the third to give Minnesota a 2-1 lead.	Rottino hustled for the tying run in the bottom half. He walked, stole second and advanced to third on a groundout. He waited until shortstop Pedro Florimon fielded the ball hit by Shin-Soo Choo and threw to first, then took off and beat Justin Morneau's throw back across the diamond. He scored on a single by Kipnis.	Chris Herrmann made it 5-2 with a run-scoring groundout in the fifth off Chris Seddon. Willingham added an RBI single in the sixth.	McAllister gave up four runs and eight hits over 4 1/3 innings and dropped to 0-4 in seven starts since beating Boston on Aug. 11. In 12 starts since defeating Tampa Bay on July 16, the right-hander is 1-7.	Game notes	 Gardenhire's son, Toby, who once played in the Twins organization, is playing for Germany in a qualifying round for the World Baseball Classic that starts Friday. ... Twins OF Darin Mastroianni likely will be limited to pinch-running the rest of the season. He hurt a tendon in a finger on his left hand while sliding head first to score in the 12th inning Tuesday. His finger struck the bat that was left at home plate by Alexi Casilla, whose infield hit scored Mastroianni. ... Herrmann made his first career start at catcher. He caught two innings Sunday in his debut. ... Cleveland activated DH Travis Hafner, out since Aug. 6 with back inflammation. Acta said Hafner will play three times a week, as advised by the medical staff. ... Twins OF Chris Parmelee will fly to Los Angeles on Thursday to be his wife, who is expecting.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PITTSBURGH --  John Axford looked to his left and the St. Louis Cardinals-Houston Astros game was on one clubhouse television. He looked to another TV on his right and saw the Los Angeles Dodgers playing the Washington Nationals.	The Milwaukee Brewers closer smiled.	"We're not scoreboard watching," Axford said. "Not at all."	Axford was fibbing, of course.	Marco Estrada pitched seven scoreless innings and rookie shortstop Jean Segura hit a double and a triple Wednesday night as the surging Brewers stayed in contention for a postseason berth with a 3-1 victory over the fading Pittsburgh Pirates.	Estrada (4-6) allowed three hits and retired the last 10 batters he faced in improving to 4-1 with a 1.23 ERA in his last six starts. He struck out four and walked one.	"We're just having a lot of fun," Estrada said as teammates roared in the background while watching Washington post a six-run inning. "That's the great thing about our team. We have a real fun group, and I think that's helped us this season. Even when it looked like we were out of it, we never gave up. We just kept playing."	Estrada wound up having more fun than he expected. He said he felt "weird" while warming up before the game because he had gone seven days between starts.	"It took me a while to feel comfortable," Estrada said. "I felt like I hadn't pitch in a long time."	Milwaukee manager Ron Roenicke felt the extra rest helped Estrada.	"I know pitchers like to stay in their routine but when you get to this time of the season guys need more time off," Roenicke said. "The extra days off can really help and they did in Marco's case. His command wasn't really good early, but it got a lot better as the game went on."	Axford worked around Andrew McCutchen's leadoff home run in the ninth inning, his 29th, for his 30th save in 38 opportunities. The homer broke a string of 22 scoreless innings for the Pittsburgh bullpen.	Milwaukee has won four straight games, seven of eight and 22 of 28. They remained 2 1-2 games behind St. Louis in the race for the second NL wild card.	The Brewers were 12 1-2 games out of the second wild card on Aug. 19, three weeks after trading ace pitcher Zack Greinke to the Los Angeles Angels.	"If anything, the Greinke trade gave us some motivation," Axford said. "We didn't feel in the clubhouse like we were out of it. We never gave up."	Pittsburgh has lost 14 of 18 and 20 of 27 to drop to 74-74, the first time they have been at .500 since they were 26-26 on June 2. The Pirates, who fell 4 1-2 games behind the Cardinals, have had 19 consecutive losing seasons, a major North American professional sports record.	"We haven't played well and it's been for a while," Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said. "So, you know, we had earned the position we were in before; we've earned this position as well. The season's 162 games for a reason."	Milwaukee's Norichika Aoki led off the game by hitting rookie Kyle McPherson's second pitch into the stands in right for his ninth home run. Aoki, Segura and Rickie Weeks each had two of the Brewers' 11 hits.	McPherson (0-1) took the loss in his first major league start, giving up two runs and seven hits in 4 1/3 innings. The Brewers scored their other run off McPherson in the fifth inning. Segura hit a leadoff double, advanced on a balk and scored on Estrada's single.	McPherson had made seven relief appearances, posting a 1.54 ERA, and was moved into the rotation in place of James McDonald, who was 2-5 with a 6.66 ERA in his last 10 games.	Segura tripled to lead off the seventh and scored when second baseman Brock Holt was charged with an error for mishandling Estrada's grounder. That put Milwaukee ahead 3-0.	McCutchen and Pedro Alvarez had two hits apiece for Pittsburgh.	The Brewers have won six straight games against Pittsburgh.	"Sometimes you just have your mojo against another team, and that seems to be the case with us against the Pirates," Roenicke said.	Game notes	 Pittsburgh 2B Neil Walker sat out for the second time in three days because of lower back soreness, an injury that caused him to miss 15 straight games from Aug. 29-Sept. 14, though he did walk as a pinch-hitter in the eighth inning. Hurdle said Walker's availability will be determined on a daily basis for the remainder of the season. ... Milwaukee GM Doug Melvin is on the trip along with the rest of the Brewers' baseball operations staff as they are holding player evaluation meetings with Roenicke and the coaching staff. ... Rookie RHP Mike Fiers (9-7, 3.23) is scheduled to pitch for Milwaukee against LHP Wandy Rodriguez (11-13, 3.65) on Thursday in the finale of the three-game series. Rodriguez is 4-1 with a 1.83 ERA in his last six games, including one relief appearance.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

NEW YORK --  The chants of "Ich-i-ro" swelled in the eighth inning as the wiry batter with the slashing swing walked to home plate. With six hits already in this doubleheader, fans expected something special from the Japanese star.	Surprising even himself, Ichiro Suzuki delivered.	Suzuki had a go-ahead single in the eighth inning to help the New York Yankees complete a doubleheader sweep of the Toronto Blue Jays with a 2-1 win Wednesday night that ensured they remained atop the AL East.	The 10-time All-Star's performance helped New York win its fourth straight and guaranteed it will end the night with at least a half-game division lead over Baltimore, which defeated the Mariners 3-1 in 11 innings.	"I haven't done anything different today so I don't know what the difference was," Suzuki said through a translator.	The 38-year-old Suzuki made a difficult catch with the bases loaded in the eighth inning of the opener to preserve a lead for Andy Pettitte in a 4-2 victory. He went 7 for 8 in the two games and stole four of New York's seven bases in the finale.	"I came in the middle of the season and I always wanted to contribute, wanted to help in this pennant race and today is a great day that I was able to help," said Suzuki, who was acquired in a trade from Seattle in late July. "I'm very sad the day is over."	He had three hits in the opener batting leadoff in place of Derek Jeter, who rested his sore ankle in the first game of the day-night doubleheader. Jeter started at shortstop for the first time in a week in the nightcap and got his 200th hit on Ricky Romero's first pitch.	The single to center tied Jeter with Lou Gehrig for most 200-hit seasons for the Yankees with eight.	Feeling nervous and out of sync at shortstop after the long layoff, Jeter was most impressed with Suzuki's day.	"That's tough to do," Jeter said. "Doubleheader. I don't think I've ever done that in a doubleheader. I've been on the other side of it, maybe an 0 for 8."	Rafael Soriano closed both games, notching his 41st and 42nd saves, the first time he saved two in one day.	The Blue Jays, playing their first doubleheader against the Yankees since 1986, were without shortstop Yunel Escobar, who began a three-game suspension for wearing eye black displaying an anti-gay slur written in Spanish during a game last weekend against Boston.	Toronto dropped to 66-81, guaranteeing it will not have a winning record this season.	With the score 1-all, Curtis Granderson was walked by Steve Delabar (4-3) to open the eighth. He moved up on Jayson Nix's sacrifice and stole third. With two outs, Suzuki guided an opposite-field hit to left for the lead. Suzuki stole two bases in the inning.	"It was just an unbelievable day," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.	Cody Eppley (1-2) got one out for his first win since April 27, 2011, for Texas against Toronto.	David Phelps followed Pettitte's sparkling five-inning return to the mound from a broken lower left leg by pitching into the seventh. He gave up one run and three hits.	Romero remained tied for the Blue Jays record with 13 straight losses and walked five to up his AL-leading total to 99. It was his third game in which he allowed one run and didn't win -- two no-decisions.	"I had a good delivery," Romero said. "That's one of the things I battled myself all year."	Adeiny Hechavarria's RBI single in the second after Phelps walked was just the 24th run Toronto has scored in Romero's last 13 starts.	In the bottom half, Chris Stewart drove in a run with a double to left that bounced over the wall and prevented Suzuki from scoring from first. Suzuki had singled and Nix was thrown out trying to score on a strong throw by center fielder Colby Rasmus. Romero had walked two to set up the tying run.	Romero was finished after allowing seven hits in six innings. He struck out five.	In the opener, Pettitte (4-3) gave up four hits in his first start since a hot shot off the bat of Cleveland's Casey Kotchman broke his left fibula on June 27.	"He gave us everything that we asked for," Girardi said.	Pettitte struggled a bit with his command, walking two, but kept the Blue Jays from hitting the ball hard with a biting breaking ball. He put runners on in each of his first four innings and had a runner on third in the second through fourth innings. But he got timely groundouts in the second, third -- a double play -- and fourth to avoid trouble. Then had a six-pitch fifth to earn the win.	"My arm feels great. My break area feels great. I'm a hundred percent," Pettitte said. "Just real happy with how my arm is feeling. More than anything it's my legs. I just got to get my legs back in shape."	With the 40-year-old lefty on a 75-pitch limit, Girardi mixed and matched liberally, using six relievers.	Clay Rapada, Derek Lowe, Joba Chamberlain and Boone Logan held Toronto scoreless through seven innings. Then Robertson gave up an RBI single to pinch-hitter Kelly Johnson and a run-scoring double to Omar Vziquel in the eighth.	Soriano relieved with two outs and runners on second and third. He walked Anthony Gose after a foul drive that landed about a foot foul down the left-field line. Rajai Davis followed with a sinking liner to left field that Suzuki caught, pulling the glove to his stomach to protect the ball.	"I'm glad I don't have a big belly because if I did it might've hit the belly and popped out," Suzuki said through a translator.	Toronto's 45-year-old Vizquel had two hits to move past Babe Ruth for 41st on the career list at 2,874.	Game notes	Robinson Cano had an RBI double and Granderson a sacrifice fly in the opener ... Toronto's Henderson Alvarez (9-13) allowed five hits in seven innings and struck out a career-high seven. ... Toronto DH Edwin Encarnacion (sore right big toe) did not play in the either game. ... To make room for Pettitte on the 40-man roster, the Yankees recalled RHP Dellin Betances from the minors and placed him on the 60-day DL.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

WASHINGTON --  Even Matt Kemp was willing to concede the phantom run the umpires said he scored for the Los Angeles Dodgers in the fourth inning -- long before his go-ahead homer in the ninth -- should not have counted.	Washington Nationals manager Davey Johnson ("They obviously blew the call"), third baseman Ryan Zimmerman ("You can't just give out free runs in the big leagues") and catcher Jesus Flores ("Terrible call") were much more blunt about it.	In a wild game Wednesday, Kemp was ruled safe at home to give Los Angeles a six-run lead even though TV replays clearly showed that Zimmerman's head-over-heels lunging tag already had been applied to runner Adrian Gonzalez at third for the inning's final out. After Washington used a six-run eighth to tie the score, Kemp led off the ninth with a homer off closer Tyler Clippard, and the struggling Dodgers grabbed a 7-6 victory for a doubleheader split that prevented the Nationals from sewing up their first playoff berth since moving from Montreal in 2005.	"It looked pretty close. I actually probably should have been running just forward and not looking back. ... I don't know if I quite made it or not," Kemp said, before asking reporters whether they had seen a replay.	Informed that he should not have scored, Kemp said: "Actually, yeah, I don't think I did. But we got lucky right there. We stole a run."	That extra run really loomed large when the hosts -- who had won the opener 3-1 thanks largely to Jordan Zimmermann's six innings of one-run baseball -- wound up sending 12 batters to the plate while scoring six runs in the eighth.	"At the time, I don't think anyone thought it was a really big deal, but it turned out to be a big deal," Zimmerman said. "It was 5-0, and they just make it 6-0."	Crew chief Mike Winters declined to comment.	"Calls like that, you never know when they're going to come back and kick you," said Washington's Michael Morse, who delivered a leadoff homer and a two-run single in the eighth.	The announced crowd of 26,931 was getting loud, perhaps anticipating a comeback and playoff-clinching victory, when Kemp drove an 0-2, elevated fastball from Clippard (2-5) over the wall in center for his 19th homer.	"I can't remember ever putting a ball in that spot and getting hurt like that in my whole career," said Clippard, who earned his 32nd save of the season in Game 1. "It's a tough one to swallow, but nothing I can do about it now."	Ronald Belisario (7-1) earned the win by getting the last two outs of the eighth inning. Brandon League picked up his third save with a hitless ninth.	Washington's victory in the opener was Los Angeles' ninth loss in 12 games -- and lowered the host's magic number for securing at least a wild-card spot to one. But the Nationals must wait at least another day to be certain of making the playoffs.	"We're not shooting for a playoff spot. We're shooting to win a division," Clippard said. "So regardless if we won tonight or not, that's not really where we want to be."	Los Angeles' Game 2 starter, Josh Beckett, threw seven shutout innings but left in the eighth after allowing four runs -- three earned -- and five hits. By then, Johnson had pulled starters Jayson Werth, Zimmerman and Adam LaRoche -- Washington's Nos. 1-3-4 hitters.	While Beckett was terrific for a time, retiring 13 consecutive batters in one stretch, Nationals starter John Lannan struggled almost from the outset. Making his second start since taking over Stephen Strasburg's slot in the rotation, Lannan looked little like the guy who entered the night 3-0 with a 2.41 ERA in the majors in 2012 -- and much more like the guy who spent most of the year at Triple-A Syracuse.	He was charged with three runs in each of the third and fourth innings, hurt by singles, walks and a hit batter. In all, Lannan lasted only 3 2-3 innings, giving up eight hits. He departed with the bases loaded in the fourth, giving way to Chien-Ming Wang, who had been out with a hip injury and missed about 2½ months.	Wang's first pitch in a major league game since June 30 missed the mark completely. The wild pitch skipped past catcher Flores, allowing a run to score. The batter, Hanley Ramirez, eventually sent a grounder to Zimmerman, who flipped over and reached out to barely tag out Gonzalez. The umpires ruled that Kemp, who was running home from third on the play, crossed the plate in time to make it 6-0 -- but he had not.	Johnson, in his words, "raised a fuss" with the umpires, to no avail.	"They all discussed it, and evidently nobody was paying attention," Johnson said. "Kemp wasn't running. He just wasn't running. The tag play was before. Obviously they missed it, but you'd think when the three of them got together somebody would've been paying attention that Kemp was not at home."	Hours before, as music blared in the Nationals' clubhouse between games, Johnson insisted it didn't matter at all that his team had earned its 90th win and lowered its magic number for a wild-card berth to one.	"The only thing that's going to mean anything to me is when we clinch the pennant," Johnson said. "That's the only thing, the only number, I'm concerned with."	The Nationals' 90 victories are the most for a major league club in the nation's capital since 1933 -- which also was the last time a D.C. team played beyond the regular season.	"Just keep the blinders on," Morse said. "Just keep pushing and pushing."	Game notes	 Zimmermann (11-8) got the win in Game 1; Aaron Harang (9-10) took the loss. ... Bryce Harper made a twisting, over-the-shoulder catch with his back to the infield on a drive to the deepest part of the park by Shane Victorino leading off the sixth inning in Game 2. ... Victorino stole two bases in Game 1 to raise his season total to 37, tying a career high.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

NEW YORK --  Ryan Howard and the Philadelphia Phillies aren't finished.	Howard hit a go-ahead homer with two outs in the ninth inning and the Phillies rallied to beat the New York Mets 3-2 on Wednesday night, adding a dramatic victory to their late-season playoff push.	"He was kind of due," manager Charlie Manuel said. "He needed a big hit like that, and he came through."	Jimmy Rollins hit a leadoff home run but the Phillies went into the ninth with only two hits. Chase Utley worked a two-out walk on a full-count pitch from rookie Josh Edgin (1-2), filling in for ailing Mets closer Frank Francisco, and Howard launched a 93 mph fastball off the facing of the second deck in right field to give his team a 3-2 lead.	"It meant something to us, and it also meant something to him. I'm sure that will give him a big boost," Manuel said.	Trying for a last-gasp postseason charge after a miserable first half, the surging Phillies (75-74) won for the 10th time in 13 games. They remained four games behind St. Louis for the second NL wild-card spot, with two other teams in between.	"To be here is a testament to the character of this team -- that we don't give up," Howard said. "It's a 162-game season and we're just going out here trying to play it all out."	The big slugger pumped his fist as he rounded first base and Phillies players broke into a happy frenzy on the bench. It was Howard's 11th homer in an injury-shortened season and first since Aug. 31.	Edgin had not allowed an earned run since Aug. 19, putting together 16 straight scoreless appearances.	"That's the Howard that we've grown accustomed to," Phillies pitcher Cole Hamels said.	Hamels equaled a season high with 10 strikeouts over six innings and left trailing 2-1. Philadelphia's young bullpen kept it close, and Jeremy Horst (2-0) got Andres Torres to ground into an inning-ending double play with the bases loaded in the eighth.	Jonathan Papelbon worked a one-hit ninth for his 36th save in 40 tries. Left fielder Domonic Brown, who had just shifted over from right, helped out with a diving catch in the corner.	The punchless Mets wasted a splendid outing from Matt Harvey, who finished his rookie season with a flourish. David Wright hit a solo homer but the Mets (66-82) dropped their eighth straight home game and 24th in the last 28 at Citi Field.	This one guaranteed them a fourth consecutive losing season, despite a 46-40 first half.	New York has lost four in a row and 10 of 11 overall. The Mets have managed three runs or fewer in a team-record 15 straight home games since a 6-5 win over Atlanta on Aug. 12 at Citi Field.	Harvey struck out seven and did not allow a hit after Rollins' homer in the latest eye-catching performance of his promising campaign. This was the last one, too. The prized right-hander, drafted seventh overall in 2010, will be shut down after 10 major league starts to protect his 24-year-old arm.	Harvey finished 3-5 with a 2.73 ERA and 70 strikeouts in 59 1/3 big league innings. He permitted only 42 hits and 26 walks.	"With this being his last start, I wish we would have got a win for him," manager Terry Collins said. "But Matt Harvey ought to spend the winter feeling pretty good about himself and the way he's handled everything up here, the way he's pitched."	A bright spot in an otherwise dismal second half for New York, Harvey walked three and threw a career-high 112 pitches over seven stellar innings. He has thrown 169 1/3 innings this season between the Mets and Triple-A Buffalo.	Harvey got two double plays and whiffed Howard for the second time with a 97 mph fastball in the seventh. He walked off to a standing ovation from the sparse crowd of 21,741 and received a handshake from veteran catcher Kelly Shoppach.	"There was definitely some excitement. I had some tingles. It was kind of a sad moment, I guess, because I knew I was done," Harvey said. "It was a good experience. ... I left it all out there."	Bobby Parnell struck out two in a one-hit eighth and handed the lead to Edgin, seeking his first career save. Francisco was unavailable after an MRI showed tendinitis in his pitching elbow.	One night after the teams were rained out at Citi Field, Rollins gave the Phillies another quick start when he homered to right on Harvey's fifth pitch. It was his 43rd career leadoff shot and sixth this season.	Rollins, who homered and scored twice in Monday night's 3-1 victory over the Mets, has 22 home runs this season and seven this month -- five in the past eight games.	Ruben Tejada singled and stole second with two outs in the third before scoring on Daniel Murphy's tying single.	Wright opened the sixth with an opposite-field drive to right-center for his 201st career homer and 18th this year. After a sensational start to the season, he has only two home runs and 12 RBIs since July 28.	The next batter was Scott Hairston and he was hit in the back by Hamels' second pitch.	Game notes	 Francisco is day to day. ... The previous major league club to score three runs or fewer in more consecutive home games was Seattle, which went 16 straight in 2010. ... Philadelphia improved to 3-59 when trailing after eight innings. ... Rollins has 26 homers against the Mets, his most against any team. ... RHP Tyler Cloyd (1-1), who lost to Harvey in his major league debut on Aug. 29, is scheduled to start Thursday night's makeup game for Philadelphia. Fellow rookie Jeremy Hefner (2-6) pitches for the Mets.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

MIAMI -- Kris Medlen and Chipper Jones found themselves linked in baseball's record books with Whitey Ford and Lou Gehrig.	More importantly to the Atlanta Braves, they just kept rolling along.	Medlen pitched eight innings of four-hit ball and the Braves won his start for the 21st straight time, beating the Miami Marlins 3-0 on Wednesday night. Jones went 1 for 4 in his final South Florida appearance, getting hit No. 2,721 to tie Gehrig for 58th on baseball's career list.	"That's the Iron Horse, man," Jones said. "Just really honored to have as many hits in my career as one of the greatest in the game. Now we've got to work on passing him."	Atlanta, closing in on securing at least an NL wild-card spot, has won 12 of its last 17 games. The Braves picked up a half-game on Washington in the NL East race, closing within five games after the Nationals split a doubleheader with the Los Angeles Dodgers.	The Marlins gave Jones a fly-fishing rod and a slew of accessories to commemorate his last game in Miami. They won't have to worry about him anymore, but Medlen might be a problem for years to come.	Medlen (9-1) lost the first two starts of his career in 2009. He hasn't taken a loss in any of his 26 starts since, with the Braves prevailing in the last 21 of those -- making them the first team since the New York Yankees to have such a streak, according to STATS LLC. The Yankees won 22 straight times when Ford started from 1950 through 1953, a span interrupted by his service during the Korean War.	Medlen tried to dismiss any comparison with the Hall of Famer.	"Whitey Ford? Pfft. Let's go. Come on. Don't even say it," Medlen said.	Medlen struck out six and walked one while lowering his ERA from 1.62 to 1.51. Rob Brantly doubled for Miami, which was shut out for the 16th time this season.	"Medlen threw the crap out of the ball," Marlins manager Ozzie Guillen said. "We pitched well, but Medlen pitched better. I think this kid is, 'Wow.' He put on a show out there."	The first of Medlen's 10 starts this season was against Miami on July 31, when he allowed one run over five innings and the Braves picked up a 7-1 victory. Little did anyone know then how the next few weeks would go -- he's now 8-0 with a 0.76 ERA as a starter, as opposed to his 2.48 ERA in 54 1/3 innings in 38 relief appearances to start the season.	Medlen threw 99 pitches Wednesday, 66 for strikes.	"I thought he was good. I thought he was really good," Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "Commanded the strike zone, both sides of the plate. We played some good (defense) behind him. ... That's a byproduct of Medlen pounding the strike zone, getting the ball, throwing the ball over and keeping guys on their toes."	Atlanta also made sure he had the lead before even taking the mound. Michael Bourn led off the game with a double and scored two batters later on Jason Heyward's sacrifice fly to center off Josh Johnson, whose woes continued.	Johnson (8-13) gave up five hits, three walks and three runs in six innings, striking out five. The Marlins have now lost seven of his last eight starts.	"First three innings it was all over the place, whether it was fouling balls off and getting deep into counts or getting a couple guys 0-2, 1-2 and then just letting them back in," Johnson said. "You can't do that."	Dan Uggla scored in the second after drawing his NL-leading 89th walk, stealing second and coming around on Jose Constanza's single to center. The lead went to 3-0 in the third when Atlanta made Johnson pay for another walk -- a leadoff pass to Martin Prado turned into a run on Freddie Freeman's sacrifice fly.	Medlen worked his way out of a little trouble in the fifth. Donovan Solano singled and went to third when Medlen's one-out pickoff throw sailed past first base. But Medlen got Bryan Petersen to pop up into short center field -- Uggla, the second baseman, had his throw home go up the third-base line, but Solano was held anyway -- and then Gorkys Hernandez grounded to shortstop to end the inning.	Jones got an ovation from the crowd before his last at-bat in Miami, a groundout in the eighth. He tipped his helmet in acknowledgment, though his night wasn't totally perfect.	He apparently forgot how many outs there were in the third, getting tagged out on a 7-4-3 relay by the Marlins to end the inning.	"That happens with age," Guillen said.	Game notes	 Jones has played more games (244) and collected more home runs (40), RBIs (165), hits (258), doubles (47) and walks (140) than any other opponent has against the Marlins. ... The Marlins and Braves both have Thursday off. Miami plans to pitch RHP Jacob Turner in New York on Friday against LHP Jonathon Niese, while Atlanta is expected to start RHP Tommy Hanson in Philadelphia on Friday against RHP Kyle Kendrick. ... Braves SS Paul Janish, who dislocated his left shoulder on Tuesday night, returned to Atlanta for evaluation. It's unknown if he could be back before the end of the regular season.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Tampa Bay Rays manager Joe Maddon knows that even after a much-needed victory, his team still has an uphill battle to make the AL playoffs.	Desmond Jennings hit a two-run triple during Tampa Bay's seven-run sixth-inning, and the Rays snapped a four-game losing streak by beating the Boston Red Sox 13-3 on Wednesday night.	Despite the win, Tampa Bay fell 6 1/2 games behind the AL East-leading New York Yankees, who swept a day-night doubleheader against Toronto. The Rays started play six games back in the AL wild-card race.	"We want to do a little of Minnesota Fats ... got to run the table," Maddon said. "We've got to believe we can do it. We have to get really hot. We have no alternative. The standings are very difficult, but we are alive and kicking."	Jennings also scored following his triple against reliever Alfredo Aceves when the throw from the outfield eluded third baseman Pedro Ciriaco.	Four Boston pitchers combined to walk six in the sixth, including passes to Carlos Pena and Jose Molina with the bases loaded. Luke Scott had a sacrifice fly, and Jeff Keppinger added an RBI single.	"Walks are the killer bee," Red Sox manager Bobby Valentine said.	Keppinger hit a solo homer, and Pena added a two-shot off Daisuke Matsuzaka (1-6) as Tampa Bay went ahead 5-3 in the fourth.	Chris Archer (1-3) allowed three runs and five hits in five innings for the Rays, who won for the second time in nine games. It was the rookie's first major league win.	"It feels pretty good," Archer said. "This is a classic example of keep the team in the game for as long as you can and they'll pull it out for you. I think it was big all around tonight. It's hard not to be selfish, but as a team it's awesome that we got the win, and for it to be my first one, that's pretty amazing, too."	The Red Sox (68-82), assured of their first losing season since 1997, got two RBIs from Jacoby Ellsbury.	Boston took a 3-1 lead in the third on Ellsbury's run-scoring single and an RBI grounder by Dustin Pedroia. Ellsbury has 10 RBIs in his last 11 games.	Ben Zobrist, who drove in four runs in the Rays' 7-5 loss to Boston on Tuesday, cut the deficit to 3-2 with an RBI single later in the third.	Tampa Bay loaded the bases with no outs during the second on singles by Evan Longoria, Scott and Keppinger. The Rays scored just once to tie it at 1 when Matt Joyce followed with a walk. Matsuzaka avoided further damage by striking out Pena and getting a double-play grounder from Molina.	Joyce also had an eighth-inning RBI single.	Matsuzaka gave up five runs and nine hits in three-plus innings. The right-hander is 2-8 in 14 starts against Tampa Bay.	"After the first inning, I kept throwing it where they wanted the ball, and they never miss those pitches. It really hurt me," Matsuzaka said through an interpreter. "As always I'm disappointed in myself for not helping my team out. It's been really hard to keep the positive going so far."	Valentine didn't directly answer a question about whether Matsuzaka will make another start this season.	"We'll see what he's feeling like (Thursday)," Valentine said. "Maybe a little more rest is what's needed at this time of year."	Matsuzaka had elbow ligament replacement surgery in June 2011, and started this season on the disabled list.	Ciriaco had a leadoff single in the first, stole second, and scored on Ellsbury's single to make it 1-0. Ciriaco is 15 for 15 in stolen-base attempts this season.	Game notes	 Tampa Bay LHP David Price (18-5) will go for his 19th win this season against Boston RHP Clay Buchholz (11-6) in the finale of the four-game series on Thursday night. ... Red Sox RHP Daniel Bard faced five batters. He walked three and gave up one hit. ... Aceves allowed four runs in two-plus innings. ... Justin Gatlin, the 100-meter bronze medalist at the London Olympics, threw the ceremonial first pitch.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CHICAGO --  On the brink of clinching a playoff spot, Brandon Phillips was missing his manager on Wednesday night.	Drew Stubbs hit a tiebreaking RBI single in the 11th inning and Cincinnati beat the Chicago Cubs 6-5 without Dusty Baker, who was diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat.	Baker left the team before the game to undergo chest X-rays that were intended to rule out pneumonia. Bench coach Chris Speier brought the lineup card to home plate and there was no sign of the 63-year-old Baker during the game.	"I guess the good thing is it's not pneumonia, but the bad thing he has an irregular heartbeat, so basically they will over keep him over at the hospital and run some more tests in the morning before he is set free," Reds head trainer Paul Lessard said.	Baker, who managed the Cubs for four seasons, hopes to rejoin the Reds on Friday.	Phillips' lazy popup with two out in the 11th on a windy night at Wrigley Field was misplayed by Cubs right fielder David DeJesus, allowing him to reach second. Stubbs then smoked a run-scoring single to left against Alberto Cabrera (0-1).	"I had to worry about my daddy," Phillips said. "I can't have daddy pass out on us. We can't let that happen. I am glad he is all right. He is going to be in my prayers when I get back to the hotel. Before I go to sleep make sure I say some prayers for him and family also. Hopefully I miss him because I miss him, I miss him and the toothpicks and the wristbands, I miss it all."	Speier said he talked to Baker.	"He sounded good and they are just doing their due diligence, just running some tests," Speier said. "He will be back shortly."	Logan Ondrusek (5-2) worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the 10th to earn the win. Jonathan Broxton earned his fourth save in six chances since joining Cincinnati in July.	Joey Votto reached four times and drove in three runs for the Reds (90-59), who have won three straight to become the second team in the majors to reach 90 wins. Cincinnati also moved a season-high 31 games over .500.	Alfonso Soriano hit his 30th homer for Chicago, which trailed 5-1 after five innings.	Cincinnati lowered its magic number to clinch a playoff spot to one with the Los Angeles Dodgers splitting a doubleheader at Washington. The Reds' magic number for a second NL Central title in three years is three.	"I am looking forward to it," Phillips said. "The only time I drink was 2010 (the last time the Reds won the NL Central), that was the first time I tasted alcohol, I'm kind of looking forward to that feeling again."	The Reds used five straight singles to score three times in the third. Votto drove in a pair with a bases-loaded single to left and Ryan Ludwick singled in Stubbs to make it 4-0.	Votto also doubled in a run in the first.	Reds starter Mike Leake retired his first 11 batters before Anthony Rizzo's two-out single in the fourth. After a walk to Soriano, Starlin Castro singled in Rizzo.	Castro finished with four singles and leads all major league shortstops with 76 RBIs	Soriano hit a long two-run drive onto Waveland in the sixth inning, giving him six career 30-homer seasons, including two with the Cubs. He now has 103 RBIs, one short of matching his career high.	"He did it in style," Cubs manager Dale Sveum said. "That ball went walking out of there. I think that was going out regardless of wind."	Castro followed with a two-out single and scored on Luis Valbuena's double down the left-field line, trimming the Reds' lead to 5-4. Leake then caught a lackadaisical Valbuena wandering off of second base to end the inning.	The 24-year-old right-hander allowed four runs and six hits over six innings.	The pesky Cubs rallied with two outs in the eighth against J.J. Hoover, who walked three batters -- including one that forced in the tying run.	Cubs starter Chris Rusin was tagged for five runs and 10 hits in five innings. The 25-year-old had given up just three runs and nine hits over his last two starts -- both of which also lasted five innings.	Game notes	 Ludwick was taken out for precautionary reasons in the fifth inning due to left groin tightness. ... Reds LHP Aroldis Chapman said his fatigued left shoulder "feels good" after throwing a bullpen session. Chapman said through an interpreter that he likely needs two or three more bullpens to work on his command. ... The Cubs agreed to a new player development contract with nearby Class-A Kane County. The contract runs through 2014. ... Chicago sends Jason Berken (0-1, 7.20 ERA) to the hill in the series finale Thursday against Johnny Cueto (17-9, 2.92). ... Soriano didn't hit his first home run of the year until May 15. It's his first season with at least 30 homers and 100 RBIs since 2005.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Bruce Chen had already pitched out of trouble each of the first three innings when the Royals left-hander issued a pair of walks and served up a base hit to Alex Rios in the fourth.	The bases were loaded, there was nobody out and the White Sox -- one of the hottest teams in baseball and winners of five straight -- were poised to deliver the crushing blow.	It never happened.	Never even came close.	Chen managed to retire three straight batters without a ball getting out of the infield, and then carried on into the seventh inning. Billy Butler's sacrifice fly and a two-run double by Alex Gordon was enough to give the Royals a 3-0 victory over the AL Central leaders Wednesday night.	"Bruce Chen was right on top of his game," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "I told him after he was done, 'You did a great job of pitching yourself into trouble in the fourth inning and even a better job of pitching yourself out of it.' Bruce did a phenomenal job."	Chen (11-12) scattered five hits and three walks over 6 2/3 innings to win for just the second time in six starts. The crafty veteran also stranded a runner on second in the sixth before getting some help from reliever Kelvin Herrera to escape more trouble in the seventh.	Herrera then pitched around two baserunners in the eighth, and Greg Holland yielded a two-out double in the ninth before finishing for his 14th save in 17 chances.	"We didn't panic," Chen said. "We stuck to our game plan."	Alcides Escobar finished with three hits, all of them off Chicago ace Chris Sale (17-7), and the Royals staved off official elimination for one more day. The White Sox (81-67) had their lead in the division trimmed to two games over the Detroit Tigers.	"This one stinks and you have to move on," White Sox manager Robin Ventura said.	Chicago will be happy to move on from playing the Royals and start rooting for them.	Kansas City improved to 8-2 in their last 10 meetings by evening the three-game series, and a win in the finale Thursday night would make the Royals 6-1 in the teams' last seven series.	They could become Chicago's biggest ally down the stretch, though. Kansas City plays seven of its final 13 games against second-place Detroit, beginning with a four-game series Monday.	"We're going to have to win no matter what. We have to take care of our business," Ventura said. "It's difficult when you play like this."	The White Sox wasted another strong start by Sale by going 1 for 12 with runners in scoring position, stranding four at third base, four more at second and three at first.	Chicago also went 0 for 5 with runners in scoring position in winning the series opener.	Meanwhile, the Royals scratched out a run in the third on a sacrifice fly by Butler, and then bore down behind Eric Hosmer's leadoff double and Escobar's intentional walk in the seventh.	After a brief visit at the mound, Sale remained in the game to face Gordon, and he walloped a pitch to the wall in left. It appeared that Viciedo would have room to make the catch, but the ball fell onto the track for a double, allowing two runs to cross and giving Kansas City a 3-0 lead.	"Our approach is not to try to do too much against Sale with his kind of stuff, his deceptive delivery," Gordon said. "Just stay simple and make something happen."	The three runs were enough to give the 23-year-old Sale his third loss against Kansas City -- he's only lost four other times this season. He's also just 2-5 over his last seven road starts.	"Chen came out and threw as well as he's ever pitched tonight against us," Sale said, his voice barely above a whisper. "He outpitched me tonight."	Game notes	Alejandro De Aza matched a career high with four hits for Chicago. He was a homer shy of the cycle. ... LHP Francisco Liriano will pitch the series finale for Chicago against RHP Jeremy Guthrie. ... Both managers announced their weekend rotations. The White Sox will go with Jake Peavy, Jose Quintana and Gavin Floyd against the Angels, while the Royals will start Luis Mendoza, Will Smith and Jake Odorizzi against Cleveland. Odorizzi will be making his big league debut.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.
