TORONTO -- All-Star slugger Josh Donaldson said the first half of Toronto's season has been "a little bit of a roller coaster."	That ride is heading upwards as the first half ends.	Donaldson hit a three-run homer, R.A. Dickey won back-to-back starts for the first time in a month and the Blue Jays beat the Detroit Tigers 6-1 on Sunday in the teams' final game before the All-Star break.	Toronto heads into the break having won eight of nine and 18 of 25. The Blue Jays are second to Baltimore in the AL East and tied with Boston for the first wild-card spot.	"We feel pretty good with where we're at right now," Donaldson said. "We've been playing well as of late. Hopefully have a nice break, everybody comes back ready to go and continue this momentum."	Dickey said Toronto's recent surge feels like "it could be a sustained thing."	Donaldson is the sixth player in American League history to hit at least 20 home runs and score 80 runs or more before the All-Star break. The others were Lou Gehrig (1936), Ted Williams (1946), Reggie Jackson (1969), Frank Thomas (1994), and Alex Rodriguez (2000).	"I think that has something to do with the guys hitting behind me," Donaldson said, referring to slugger Jose Bautista, Edwin Encarnacion and Michael Saunders. Bautista is currently recovering from a sore left big toe. Encarnacion and Saunders will be joining Donaldson for the All-Star Game in San Diego.	Donaldson is the first player to score 80 or more runs before the break since 2008, when Ian Kinsler (84) and Hanley Ramirez (80) both did it.	Dickey (7-9) allowed one run and five hits in seven innings to win consecutive starts for the first time since victories at Boston on June 3 and at Detroit on June 8.	"We didn't do much against Dickey," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said. "We hit a couple of balls hard early and after that he settled in. He did a very nice job."	Jesse Chavez got two outs in the eighth and Brett Cecil got the third. Bo Schultz finished for Toronto, which has won eight of 11 against Detroit.	The Blue Jays took a 2-0 led against Anibal Sanchez (5-10) in the second when catcher Josh Thole hit a bases-loaded single. For Thole, the RBI were his first since hitting a solo home run at Tampa Bay on April 4, Toronto's second game of the season.	Donaldson, the 2015 AL MVP, made it 5-0 with a two-out drive in the fourth, his 23rd.	Saunders made it 6-1 with an RBI single off Kyle Ryan in the eighth.	Sanchez lost his second straight start, allowing five runs and eight hits in four innings. He has lost seven straight decisions as a starter, including five in a row on the road.	"I want to make the second half strong," Sanchez said. "Right now I can say I had the worst first half of my whole career. I've got to continue working."	Encarnacion sat out after dropping his appeal of a one-game suspension for making contact with umpire Vic Carapazza. An All-Star this season for the third time, Encarnacion was suspended for bumping Carapazza's shoulder after being ejected at the end of the first inning in Toronto's 19-inning loss to Cleveland on July 1.	THIS IS 40	Toronto continued its 40th season celebrations with a pregame ceremony honoring several former Blue Jays, including Hall of Famer Roberto Alomar, slugger Joe Carter and two-time World Series-winning manager Cito Gaston.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: OF J.D. Martinez (right elbow) is taking swings but is still "a few weeks away" from a return, Ausmus said.	Blue Jays: Donaldson started at DH for the second straight day, with Darwin Barney at 3B.	UP NEXT	Tigers: Following the All-Star break, RHP Justin Verlander (8-6, 4.07) starts the opener of a three-game home series against Kansas City. Verlander has won once in his past four starts.	Blue Jays: Toronto heads on the road after the All-Star break, with RHP Marcus Stroman (7-4, 4.89) starting the opener of a three-game series at Oakland. Stroman allowed two runs in eight innings to beat Kansas City on July 6.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MIAMI --  An NL All-Star jersey was draped over the chair at Giancarlo Stanton's locker Sunday, and lately it's looking like a better fit.	The $325 million slugger ended a slump-marred first half of the season Sunday with a homer that put the Miami Marlins ahead to stay, and they completed their first series sweep of Cincinnati since 2003 by winning 7-3.	Stanton didn't make the All-Star team but will compete in the Home Run Derby. He goes into the break with 20 home runs and 50 RBI, even though his play was nothing special for a prolonged stretch.	"You could have picked anyone in the stands and put them in right field a month ago," he said. "It's pretty good now. There have been good strides."	Stanton was batting .193 on June 15 but has raised his average to .233. His latest hit was a two-run homer in the fifth inning that gave Miami a 4-3 lead.	How will he do in the Derby in San Diego on Monday?	"We'll see," he said. "You're going to have to watch. I look forward to it a lot."	"I hope he hits some monumental ones," manager Don Mattingly said. "There's a building out there in left field down the line -- I think he can clear that."	Thanks to three consecutive wins over Cincinnati, and despite Stanton's struggles, the Marlins (47-41) have their best record at the All-Star break since 1997.	"It's time to press on the gas, man," Stanton said. "We can peel off with everyone or we can keep going. No one is going to remember the halftime record."	The last-place Reds, swept in Miami for the first time since 1996, were again hurt by a succession of baserunning mistakes and defensive lapses.	"We were awful today defensively," manager Bryan Price said.	Miami's Adeiny Hechavarria scored from second base on a passed ball, a franchise first. All-Star center fielder Marcell Ozuna threw out Brandon Phillips on the bases for the second game in a row.	Four Marlins relievers combined to allow two baserunners over the final five innings. Mike Dunn (1-1) pitched a perfect fifth to break the franchise record for career pitching appearances with his 369th.	Reds rookie Cody Reed (0-4) allowed three earned runs in 4 2/3 innings to remain winless in five career starts.	"I just made that one bad pitch -- to Stanton," Reed said. "The guy is getting paid 300-something-million to hit home runs; he does that from time to time."	Reds starters have an ERA of 5.86 this month. Miami improved to 15-6 against left-handers.	BAD DEFENSE	Sloppy fielding hurt Cincinnati in the second inning, when Miami scored twice. Miguel Rojas doubled and took advantage of All-Star right fielder Jay Bruce's poor throw to score on a single by Hechavarria, who took second on the play.	A pitch by Reed then caromed off catcher Tucker Barnhart's shin guard, and when the ball rolled behind the first-base coaching box, first baseman Joey Votto was slow to react, giving Hechavarria time to score easily.	Miami also scored on a passed ball in Saturday's win.	SUZUKI UPDATE	Marlins pinch-hitter Ichiro Suzuki crumpled to the dirt when hit on the left knee by a pitch from Raisel Iglesias in the seventh inning, but he stayed in the game. He needs 10 hits for 3,000.	REVERSALS	Umpire Mike Estabrook twice called Marlins out on plays at first base, and both rulings were quickly overturned by replay reviews. The second reversal gave Miguel Rojas an infield single, and he later scored on Realmuto's two-out single in the sixth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: 1B Justin Bour (sprained ankle) is expected to return soon after the All-Star break.	Reds: RHP Homer Bailey (elbow surgery), who made a rehab start Thursday at Triple-A Louisville, is expected to pitch again July 15 and July 20 before potentially returning to the Reds, manager Bryan Price said.	UP NEXT	When the Marlins visit the St. Louis Cardinals for three games beginning Friday, the starters are expected to be Wei-Yin Chen, Adam Conley and Koehler, with All-Star Jose Fernandez skipping a turn to help limit his innings pitched.	After the break, the Reds return home to face the Milwaukee Brewers for a weekend series that begins Friday. The Reds plan to start, in order, Anthony DeSclafani, John Lamb and Dan Straily. Brandon Finnegan and Reed are scheduled to start the first two games of the following series against Atlanta.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BALTIMORE --  The Baltimore Orioles cruised into the All-Star break with a performance that typified their play for much of the first half of the season.	Baltimore got another solid start from Chris Tillman, and the Orioles added two more homers to their major league-leading total in a 4-2 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Sunday.	The Orioles reached the break atop the AL East with a 51-36 record, including 33-14 at home.	"We're just trying to do everything to make sure we're as good as we're capable of being," manager Buck Showalter said.	Tillman pitched seven innings of three-hit ball, and Chris Davis and J.J. Hardy homered to help Baltimore capture the deciding matchup of the three-game series.	The Orioles have 137 home runs, the most they've ever hit before the break.	"There are always things that you can work on, but I like the position that we're in right now," Davis said. "Obviously, finishing off the first half with two wins at home is good to build some momentum going into the second half of the season."	Tillman (12-2) didn't have a perfect inning until the seventh. But the right-hander allowed only one runner past second base and offset his season-high five walks with five strikeouts.	"The end result was good," Tillman said. "We came out on top. It was a grind. It was a grind from the get-go. I was missing with all my pitches early. Fortunately, we were able to kind of get in somewhat of a rhythm and mix some pitches and get out of innings."	Brad Brach worked the eighth and Zach Britton got three outs for his 27th save in 27 opportunities.	Angels starter Tim Lincecum (1-3) gave up three runs and nine hits in 5 2/3 innings. The 32-year-old was making his fifth start since signing with the Angels on May 20.	Lincecum kept the Orioles in check with the exception of an opposite-field, two-run shot in the fourth inning by Davis that made it 2-1.	"The best we've seen him," manager Mike Scioscia said. "He made very few mistakes."	Lincecum was pleased with his outing, especially after giving five runs in 4 2/3 innings in his previous start at Tampa Bay.	"I thought I challenged guys pretty well," the right-hander said. "Made some pitches when I had to and my defense played real well, too."	Well, not exactly.	Los Angeles fell into a 3-1 hole in the sixth after a two-out popup by Pedro Alvarez dropped between shortstop Andrelton Simmons and left fielder Ji-Man Choi. Simmons exacerbated the miscue by throwing wildly to second base. Hardy followed with an RBI single.	"There was a mix up in communication," Scioscia said.	Mike Trout and Albert Pujols had RBI for the Angels, who reached the break in last place for the first time since 1999.	Pujols got Los Angeles to 3-2 with a sacrifice fly in the eighth, but Hardy countered with a solo shot off Huston Street in the bottom half. It was his first homer since April 12.	Angels third baseman Yunel Escobar was ejected in the seventh inning while in the field.	REPLAY REVERSAL	Los Angeles got a first-inning run when a call at the plate was reversed after a replay review. Kole Calhoun was initially ruled out on a double by Trout before manager Mike Scioscia challenged the call.	The lead stood up until Davis hit his 22nd home run after Mark Trumbo's leadoff single.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: 1B C.J. Cron was in the clubhouse Sunday, his broken left hand in a soft cast. The injury occurred Friday when he was hit by a pitch. He is scheduled to see a specialist on Monday.	Orioles: LF Hyun Soo Kim strained his right hamstring running out a first-inning grounder and was removed from the game.	UP NEXT	Angels: Los Angeles comes out of the All-Star break on Friday with a matchup against the visiting Chicago White Sox.	Orioles: Yovani Gallardo will start against Tampa Bay on Friday as Baltimore launches the second half with a seven-game road trip.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BOSTON -- David Price was the ace the Red Sox have expected. David Ortiz is making what he's calling his final season look historic.	Price threw eight shutout innings in his best start with Boston, Ortiz entered the All-Star break with impressive numbers after hitting a two-run homer, and the Red Sox sent the Tampa Bay Rays to their sixth straight loss, 4-0 Sunday.	The 40-year-old Ortiz heads to his 10th All-Star game with a .332 average and 72 RBI in what he announced last fall will be his final year. It's the most RBI ever at the break by a player 40 or older.	"It's probably beyond our expectations coming into his final season," Boston manager John Farrell said. "Just a powerful and impressive first half."	Ortiz got dressed at his locker and joked, "I feel like I'm 30" before reflecting on his upcoming final All-Star game.	"It's my last one," he said before heading out to begin his travel to San Diego. "I look forward to being a part of it."	The slugger has struggled with sore feet this season. He said he's looking forward to some rest before the second half.	"All I worry about now is coming back in one piece," he joked.	Price (9-6) struck out 10, allowed four hits, walked one and hit two batters in snapping a personal two-game losing streak. Price didn't give up a hit after the third inning, retiring 17 of the last 19 batters.	Coming into the break with a higher than expected ERA, the lefty said he never felt down.	"I was never discouraged," he said after lowering his ERA from 4.64 to 4.34. "I never lost confidence in my abilities and I know my coaching and my teammates didn't either."	The victory completed a three-game sweep for the Red Sox and handed Tampa Bay its 22nd loss in 25 games.	"Obviously not the way we wanted to go into the break," Rays manager Kevin Cash said. "Hopefully we can erase a little bit of what's taken place over the last 25 games."	Mookie Betts had three singles and drove in a run to help the Red Sox complete their first sweep since a three-game set at home against Oakland on May 9-11.	Brad Ziegler, acquired from Arizona after Friday night's games, completed the four-hitter by getting the final three outs in his Red Sox debut.	Jake Odorizzi (3-5) got the loss, allowing four runs in five innings.	"The Ortiz one was a fastball down and possibly tailing away from him," Odorizzi said. "I think he just kind of one-handed it."	Price had received two runs or fewer in each of his last seven starts. His teammates offered better support right away by grabbing a 3-0 lead in the first inning.	Ortiz hit his homer into the Green Monster seats after Xander Bogaerts' sacrifice fly. Betts' RBI single made it 4-0 an inning later.	GLAD AND SURPRISED	Ziegler wore No. 29 after the Red Sox acquired the 36-year-old from Arizona for a pair of minor leaguers.	The right-hander said the last conversation he had with the Diamondbacks before the trade was the possibility of an extension.	"I said: `I'm open to whatever. Just come back to me and let me know," he said. "The next time I heard from them I was traded. That's part of why I was caught off-guard and surprised how early it happened."	AGAIN	Tampa Bay's Brandon Guyer was hit by a pitch twice, bringing his season total to 20.	ROUSING OVATION	Six-year-old Caroline Fahey of Newton, Massachusetts, sang the anthem flawlessly and got a huge hand from the fans and both dugouts.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: They're still planning that CF Kevin Kiermaier (broken left hand) will return Friday.	Red Sox: 1B Hanley Ramirez was out for his second straight day with a sore left shin ... Both RHP Junichi Tazawa (tightness shoulder) and utility player Brock Holt (sprained left ankle) were unavailable.	UP NEXT	Rays: RHP Chris Archer (4-12, 4.61 ERA) is slated to start Friday when they host the Orioles and RHP Yovani Gallardo (3-1, 5.82).	Red Sox: LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (1-3, 8.59) is expected to be recalled Friday and start the first of a three-game series against the Yankees in New York.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PITTSBURGH -- Kris Bryant wouldn't let another win slip away.	After Chicago squandered two leads, Bryant's RBI single in the eighth inning lifted the Cubs to a 6-5 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Sunday.	Pinch-hitter Matt Szczur doubled to left field with one out against Pirates reliever Tony Watson (1-3). Bryant, who had three hits and reached base four times, followed with his tiebreaking hit to put the Cubs back ahead.	"I just go out and try to make something happen," Szczur said. "I was able to get a good pitch to drive and (Bryant) did the rest. . We've been grinding, we're a bunch of grinders, so that was a good way to end the first half. We feel good about ourselves."	Chicago avoided a series sweep ended its five game losing streak. Pittsburgh lost for just the second time in 11 games heading to the All-Star break.	With the win, the Cubs carry a seven-game lead over the second-place St. Louis Cardinals into the break.	"We need a break," Chicago manager Joe Maddon said. "We need to get guys rested. The combination of the schedule and, more specifically, the last week with the way games were scheduled, it put us in a fatigue situation."	Cubs reliever Pedro Strop (2-2) gave up Andrew McCutchen's tying sacrifice fly in the seventh, Carl Edwards pitched a hitless eight and Hector Rondon got the last three outs for his 14th save.	The Pirates tied the score at 5-5 after the Cubs failed to turn a double play off a dribbler from Starling Marte in the seventh. With rookie Josh Bell at second base and John Jaso at first, Marte grounded to shortstop Addison Russell with Bell running back to second.	Russell didn't tag Bell and instead handed off to second baseman Ben Zobrist, whose relay throw to first failed to beat Marte. First baseman Anthony Rizzo threw back across the diamond to third, where Bell avoided a tag from Javier Baez.	With runners on the corners and one out, McCutchen drove in Bell with a fly to deep right field. Strop ended the inning by getting David Freese on a fly ball.	Strop had come in for starter John Lackey, who had another inconsistent outing. After allowing four runs in his first three innings, which included McCutchen's 14th home run of the season and his second in two days, Lackey rebounded by shutting down the Pirates through the following three innings.	Lackey lost his control again when he walked Bell and allowed Jaso to follow with a single to start the seventh inning.	Pirates starter Jonathan Niese fared worse, giving up five earned runs in 3 2/3 innings. He was pulled in favor of Arquimedes Caminero in the fourth inning after surrendering a two-run home run to Albert Almora Jr., retiring the following two batters and allowing back-to-back hits to Bryant and Rizzo in top of the fourth inning.	"When he's been good, there's downhill angle, he's had good command down in the zone, getting the ball in the glove side," Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said. "There were too many pitches elevated again today. That's really been the one common theme, is location. With better location down, he's been much more efficient."	Niese has lost five of his past six starts and is 7-7 after beginning the season 6-2.	"I'm really done worrying about my mechanics," Niese said. "As long as I'm executing pitches, that's all that matters. So, this All-Star break is going to be good. It's a good reset button. I'm going to go home, enjoy the family and come back in the second half and give it all I got. Just start executing pitches."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: OF Dexter Fowler will miss the All-Star Game on Tuesday and likely some time following the break. Fowler, who is recovering form a right hamstring strain, played in his first minor-league rehab game for Class A South Bend on Friday. He will travel to San Diego to take part in the All-Star festivities.	Pirates: OF Gregory Polanco did not play for a second consecutive game due to left hamstring tightness. ... 2B Josh Harrison also was absent. He exited Pittsburgh's game Saturday in the third inning after fouling a fastball off his left foot. ... RHP Gerrit Cole made his second rehab start with Class Triple-A Indianapolis on Sunday. He is expected to rejoin Pittsburgh following the break.	UP NEXT	Cubs: Chicago won't play again until Friday, when it will come out of the All-Star break to face the surging Texas Rangers, who limped into the break.	Pirates: The Washington Nationals will welcome Pittsburgh to Nationals Park following the break for the first game of a three-game weekend set starting Friday.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CHICAGO --  Jeff Francoeur has been around long enough to know a starting pitcher throwing in front of his family and friends may not always go smoothly.	For Mike Foltynewicz, it couldn't have gone much better.	Foltynewicz allowed five hits in seven innings, Francoeur and Jace Peterson homered and the Atlanta Braves beat the Chicago White Sox 2-0 on Sunday.	Foltynewicz (3-3), who grew up in the far southwest suburbs of Chicago, had a career-high 10 strikeouts and no walks. He struck out the side in the seventh on 12 pitches.	"Especially with family and friends being here, growing up close to here, sometimes that can backfire and you try too hard," Francoeur said. "He was composed, pitched great and we said coming into spring I felt like he was the one wild card on this team we hadn't seen what he could do yet."	The 24-year-old right-hander won for the first time since beating the Giants on May 30. He was placed on the disabled list on June 4 with a bone spur and made his third start since returning.	He met with his family and friends after the win.	"I just really put my mind on to stay aggressive. It's a really aggressive hitting team. Day games they will probably be swinging even more, so just let the defense do the work and when I got ahead I finally put them away today," Foltynewicz said.	Foltynewicz threw a 98 mph fastball by Dioner Navarro on his final pitch for his 10th strikeout.	"God almighty that was a little glimpse of what he's capable of. That was electric the entire day," Braves interim manager Brian Snitker said. "He was under control, couldn't wait to get the ball back early in the game and he started kind of collecting himself really good and breathing, and that stuff was really, really good."	Chris Withrow pitched a scoreless eighth for the Braves and Jim Johnson finished for his second save in four chances.	White Sox starter James Shields (4-10) allowed six hits, including both homers, in 7 2/3 innings. He struck out two and fell to 2/3 with Chicago.	"I think by today, you are looking at him and like the way he was throwing," White Sox manager Robin Ventura said. "Velocity was up. There was a couple that got in there, but in this ballpark, a couple of solos is going to happen every once in a while. As far as being able to grit through it and throw strikes, he was there."	The White Sox were denied their sixth straight series win after dropping two of three.	After retiring the first four batters, Shields was tagged for a solo shot by Francoeur in the second inning. It was Francoeur's fifth of the season and second in two days. An inning later, Shields gave up another home run to Peterson, giving the Braves a 2-0 lead. It was Peterson's fourth of the season.	A.J. Pierzynski hit his 400th career double in the fifth inning. He became the fourth catcher in major league history with 400 or more doubles.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Braves: C Tyler Flowers reported improvement in his strained left hand. He received treatment before the game and was scheduled to be re-examined in Atlanta during the All-Star break next week. He will undergo an MRI on Monday. He was hurt when Miami Marlins pitcher A.J. Ramos struck him on the hand with a pitch the previous weekend. The injury was aggravated on a checked swing in the second inning on Saturday. ... Closer Arodys Vizcaino wasn't available because skin irritation on his right elbow. Snitker expects him to be available after the break.

MILWAUKEE -- For a team that thinks it can and will play a whole lot better, the St. Louis Cardinals are in decent position.	Mike Leake struck out a season-high 10 over seven innings, Matt Adams and Randal Grichuk homered, and the Cardinals cooled off Milwaukee rookie Junior Guerra in a 5-1 victory over the Brewers on Sunday.	Aledmys Diaz scored from first on a single in the fifth to snap a tie and the Cardinals entered the All-Star break having cut a 12-game deficit to the Cubs to seven in the NL Central.	"That's pretty impressive," manager Mike Matheny said, "because we haven't played well."	Adams snapped an 0-for-27 skid with a solo homer estimated at 455 feet to lead off the second. That ended a 16 1/3-inning scoreless streak for Guerra (6-2). The right-hander allowed another solo shot to Grichuk in the sixth and snapped a three-start winning streak.	Grichuk and Adams added RBI hits in the ninth.	"Even though the (hitless skid) I felt that I was squaring up some balls and just hitting them hard right at them," Adams said. "But I was swinging at balls I don't normally swing at. The last couple days I felt I was able to manage the strike zone a little bit better."	Jonathan Lucroy had two hits, including an RBI single in the first for the Brewers, who are 0-13-1 in their last 14 series with St. Louis.	Strikeouts have been a problem Milwaukee season, and Leake (6-7) was an unlikely candidate to keep that going.	Leake entered with a rate of 5.7 strikeouts-per-nine-inning, ranking 91st out of 99 qualifying pitchers in the majors. However, he used his slider to keep Milwaukee off balance.	"I had that to go to because it was working and they were swinging over it," Leake said. "So why not use it a little bit more?"	Leake allowed six hits and no walks in his first win since June 12.	"Mike was really good today," Matheny said. "He got into some bad spots and made better pitchers when that happened."	The Brewers wasted Chris Carter's leadoff triple in the seventh, his first since 2014, and didn't score after putting runners at first and third with no outs in the third.	"To sustain a rally, you have to get something going there," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said.	Hernan Perez fanned three times, and the Brewers struck out 10 or more times for the 42nd time in 87 games.	Ex-Brewers reliever Jonathan Broxton struck out two in a perfect eighth before a two-run ninth put it away.	The Cardinals took a 2-1 lead in the fifth thanks to their speedy All-Star. Diaz reached on his 19th infield single with two out. He then never stopped and scored from first on Stephen Piscotty's bloop single off center fielder Kirk Nieuwenhuis' glove.	"I just ran hard and looked at the third base coach," Diaz said. "I ran like it was a double in the gap and he sent me to home plate. I was ready to keep running."	The 31-year-old Guerra walked Leake with two out in the sixth to end his day. The former independent league right-hander gave up seven hits and three walks while striking out five.	"I didn't make quality pitches at times," Guerra said. "When I missed my spot, they took advantage and got some big hits."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: LF Matt Holliday (ankle) didn't start for a second straight day, but flied out as a pinch hitter in the eighth. ... C Alberto Rosario went 1 for 3 in his first big league start with veteran Yadier Molina resting a sore knee.	Brewers: OF Domingo Santana (elbow) will remain in Milwaukee during the All-Star break to rehab. "The goal is to hopefully increase his on-field activity starting Friday in Cincinnati," Counsell said. "Hopefully by the weekend, we can determine dates for (a minor league rehab assignment)."	WEB GEM	A fan in the first inning made a leaning catch of a foul ball with his glove, bounced off the top of the Milwaukee dugout and fell backward to the ground. The man held onto the ball and drew cheers from Brewers owner Mark Attanasio, sitting nearby.	UP NEXT	Cardinals: Diaz replaces injured teammate Matt Carpenter in Tuesday's All-Star Game. St. Louis returns from the break Friday against Miami to start a 10-game homestand.	Brewers: Lucroy heads to his second All-Star Game. Milwaukee then begins a six-game trip in Cincinnati on Friday.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

HOUSTON --  The Houston Astros keep finding ways to win games late.	Jake Marisnick scored the winning run on an errant throw in the 10th inning as the Astros rallied for a 2-1 victory over the Oakland Athletics on Sunday.	The walk-off win was the Astros' eighth of the season, third against the A's and second of the series, including Friday's 10-9 victory.	"We seem to be full of those lately," Marisnick said. "It's a nod to this team and how we don't give up."	Marisnick led off the 10th with a single off Liam Hendricks (0-2) and stole second on George Springer's strikeout before reaching third on a groundout by Marwin Gonzalez.	After Jose Altuve was intentionally walked, Marisnick scored on Carlos Correa's chopper to third that Danny Valencia threw up the line to first as Yonder Alonso's attempted tag missed Correa.	"We know we have a good team, and we can score runs at any time, so we have to put good at-bats together and the runs will come," Correa said.	The error was the A's season-high fourth of the game. The A's had not made an error in a franchise-record 15 straight games entering Sunday.	"He'll tell you that it's a play he expects to make," Oakland manager Bob Melvin said. "You don't win many games with four errors, yet we got one pitch away from winning the game. The first ones didn't cost us, but the last one did."	Will Harris (1-1) pitched a perfect 10th for the win.	"I like the fact that we stay resilient and we compete the whole game," Houston manager A.J. Hinch said. "We took advantage of a couple mistakes to walk out of here with a win at the break."	Evan Gattis hit an RBI double with two outs in the ninth off Ryan Madson to tie it at 1.	"These guys have battled me for years," Madson said. "A lot of times they find a way."	Marcus Semien gave the A's a 1-0 lead on an RBI single in the sixth. Matt McBride started the inning with a single and moved to second on Coco Crisp's sacrifice bunt before Semien's single.	Sean Manaea scattered five hits with six strikeouts in seven shutout innings. Manaea had struggled away from Oakland, going 0-3 with an 11.66 ERA in three starts entering Sunday.	Dallas Keuchel allowed one run on four hits with five strikeouts in seven innings. The left-hander continued his recent string of good outings and has allowed three runs or less in four of his last five starts.	"I'm feeling better," Keuchel said. "It's good to get the break like that. I'm just trying to follow in the footsteps of the other starters, and that's a good thing to see when we are getting starts out of the starters and getting timely offense."	TRAINING ROOM	Athletics: 2B Eric Sogard (left knee surgery) will start to do more baseball activity after the All Star break, Melvin said. LHP Sean Doolittle, who has been on the 15-day DL with a left shoulder strain since late June, hasn't thrown yet, but is feeling better, Melvin said.	Astros: OF Colby Rasmus was out of the lineup for a third straight day with an ear infection. ... RHP Scott Feldman was day-to-day after leaving Saturday's game in the ninth due to back stiffness. Hinch said Feldman would not have been available for Sunday's game anyways due to throwing 52 pitches Saturday.	SHOWING OFF THE SPEED	Gattis had his first career steal in the second. Gattis took off for second and went in without a throw as Danny Worth was called out on strikes. Gattis had only one other stolen base attempt in his career, a caught stealing on July 23, 2015, against Boston.	UP NEXT	Athletics: LHP Rich Hill (9-3, 2.25 ERA) is scheduled to start the first game back from the All-Star break Friday against Toronto. Hill has a six-game winning streak and has allowed three runs or less in each of his last 12 starts.	Astros: RHP Doug Fister (8-6, 3.55) is scheduled to start the first game back from the All-Star break Friday in Seattle. Fister will be looking to end a three-game losing streak.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  The Seattle Mariners desperately wanted to go into the All-Star break with a winning record.	Robinson Cano and Adam Lind homered in a five-run seventh inning and the Mariners held off the Kansas City Royals 8-5 on Sunday.	Cano's two-run shot to deep right field for his 21st home run of the season extended the Mariners' lead to 5-0. Lind hit a three-run shot, his 13th, a few batters later.	"A lot of good at-bats," Seattle manager Scott Servais said. "Guys were grinding. Definitely want to go to the break above .500.  It was an important game for us today."	The Mariners (45-44) head into the break above .500 for the second time since 2010, after going 51-44 in 2014.	The Royals scored five runs over the final three innings, pulling within three on Alex Gordon's homer leading off the ninth.	Mike Montgomery (3-3) pitched 6 1/3 strong innings, giving up one run and five hits, in his first start of the season.	Dillion Gee (3-3) struggled early and picked up the loss for the Royals, giving up three runs and five hits in 3 2/3 innings.	One of the key moments in Gee's rough outing occurred in the first inning where an errant throw on a double play opportunity eventually led to Seattle's first score.	"I kinda got caught in between when I came up to take a look at second," Gee said.  "It was right when the umpire was kinda like, making his way into position and I tried to slow up a little bit and it sailed on me. Just a costly mistake"	Brett Eibner had three hits, including his third homer of the season in the seventh and an RBI single in the Royals' three-run eighth.	Despite the loss, the Royals went into the All-Star break with a winning record for the third straight season at 45-42.	Kyle Seager had a two-run single in the first, and Ketel Marte added a run-scoring single in the fourth to give the Mariners a 3-0 lead.	Marte finished the game with two hits in four at bats to go along with that run scoring single in the fourth inning.	"You know, see the ball, see the ball.  If I feel good, I know I'll get on base." Marte said. "I know I've got the talent.  I know I can hit. You know, I'm trying to come back and give a hundred percent every day and see what happens after."	Kendrys Morales' bases-loaded walk pulled the Royals to 8-2 in the eighth, and Cheslor Cuthbert capped the three-run inning with a sacrifice fly.	MASHING MARINERS	Seattle's two homers pushed it into second by themselves with a team total of 132 home runs on the season. ... Cano will compete in the 2016 Home Run Derby on Monday at Petco Park. He is the first Mariner to compete in the contest since Bret Boone in 2003. This is Cano's first Derby since 2013 when he was with the New York Yankees.	ROYALS AT THE ESPYS	After the All-Star Game on Tuesday, Eric Hosmer and Salvador Perez will attend the 2016 ESPY's on Wednesday night in Los Angeles. Kansas City is nominated for "Best Team" and manger Ned Yost is nominated for "Best Coach/Manager". This will be Perez first trip to the ESPY's. "Yeah, it's cool. The All-Star Game is a special moment, there's a lot of top players there-a lot of All Stars. As for the ESPY's, this is my first time going so that's pretty good for us."	UP NEXT	Following the All Star break, the Royals travel to Detroit to face the Tigers in a three game series then come back home for a nine game homestead against Cleveland, Texas and Los Angeles. The Mariners return from the break for two series at home then will hit the road for the rest of July to face Toronto, Pittsburgh and Chicago.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Max Kepler and the Minnesota Twins are going into the All-Star break playing their best baseball.	Kepler hit the first grand slam by the Twins this season, one of their four homers in a 15-5 win Sunday at the AL-leading Texas Rangers. While still in last place in the AL, Minnesota has won seven of its last nine games.	"We always talk about trusting the process, but when you get good results and win games, you understand how enjoyable it is to go out there and compete and come out and win games," manager Paul Molitor said. "I'd like to think that these guys are hungry to win as many games going forward. That's kind of an understatement. It should be the mindset all the time."	Minnesota (32-56) won three of four at Texas after taking the last two games of its home series against the Rangers the previous weekend.	Kepler's slam with two outs in the fifth off A.J. Griffin (3-1) put the Twins up 6-0. It was the first career grand slam for Kepler, and seventh homer in his last 20 games.	"We're just having fun. Everybody's laughing before the game, enjoying themselves as much as they can. Picking each other up," Kepler said. "When you have fun like that, you forget about the bad at-bats and all the negative swings you take or whatever it is."	Kennys Vargas hit a towering shot to center in the fourth for the game's first run. Eduardo Escobar and Brian Dozier added back-to-back homers in a seven-run seventh for the Twins.	Minnesota has hit 29 homers the last 15 games, and the Twins' 140 runs since June 18 are the most in the majors.	Tommy Milone (2-2) struck out three and walked three. The left-hander was out of the game after walking Adrian Beltre to start the sixth, and Ryan Rua promptly grounded into a double play against reliever Taylor Rogers.	Texas (54-36) still has the AL's best record but has lost nine of 12. Its AL West lead has dwindled from 10 games to 5 1/2 over Houston, still the largest ever for the Rangers at the break, but their smallest since June 14.	"There are points in the season where they don't look so well, don't feel so well. Today capped all that off. Hopefully, that's the bottom," Texas manager Jeff Banister said. "There's some times when you're not playing well, you kind of hope for a rainout. We get a four-day rainout."	Minnesota matched its season high with 18 hits after also having 18 in the series opener Thursday night. Robbie Grossman, Eddie Rosario and Kurt Suzuki, the Nos. 6-8 batters, each had three hits, and No. 9 batter Escobar had two hits.	"It's great to score 15 runs. It's a good way to end the half," Grossman said. "We've been playing some good baseball. We'll recharge in the next couple of days and get back after it."	OFF THE BASE -- BARELY	Rosario, coming off a four-hit game for the Twins on Saturday night, clearly slid into second base ahead of the tag in his first at-bat in the second inning Sunday. Banister asked for a replay review, which showed Rosario's foot just briefly lost contact with the bag while 2B Rougned Odor was still applying a tag. The safe call was overturned for the second out, and Suzuki then had what was an inning-ending flyball instead of a likely sac fly to leave Grossman stranded at third base.	SHORT HOPS	Vargas had his third homer in six games since being called up July 4. ... Odor had two errors in the eighth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Twins: CF Byron Buxton missed his second game because of a bruised right knee sustained in the first inning Friday night when he crashed into the wall. Buxton was available, but Molitor wanted to give Buxton more time to get him "back feeling good" instead of playing just one more game before the All-Star break.	Rangers: RHP Keone Kela (right elbow) was scheduled to pitch in relief at Double-A Frisco for the second consecutive game Sunday night. If all goes well, he could rejoin the Rangers after the All-Star break.	UP NEXT	Twins: Minnesota opens a three-game series Friday at home against AL Central-leading Cleveland.	Rangers: After the All-Star break, the Rangers open a 10-day, nine-game road trip Friday with an interleague series at the Chicago Cubs.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

LOS ANGELES -- With their bats finally catching up to their pitching, the Los Angeles Dodgers are taking a three-game winning streak and a jolt of confidence into the All-Star break.	"Everybody's swinging the bat really well," said Howie Kendrick, who had three hits in the Dodgers' 3-1 victory over the San Diego Padres on Sunday.	"It took us a little while to get it going. (Justin Turner and Adrian Gonzalez) had a little lull there. (Corey) Seager's been hot all year, but it's good to see different guys get it going."	Rookie Kenta Maeda (8-6) struck out a career-high 13 over seven innings and held San Diego to a run on two hits, including a solo homer to Derek Norris. He retired 14 of the first 15 batters he faced and struck out six straight near the end of his outing.	"It seemed like everything played off the fastball," catcher Yasmani Grandal said. "He was commanding it, and then he was the same ol' Kenta, throwing curveballs for strikes, sliders for strikes, good pitches for changeups. But we kept them honest with the fastball."	Gonzalez got his first homer in 25 games to give the Dodgers a 3-1 lead in the fifth against Christian Friedrich (4-5). Gonzalez has hit safely in five straight games and is batting .455 over his past 12 games.	Kendrick extended his hitting streak to seven games. He doubled and scored in the first and drove in the Dodgers' second run with line-drive single in the second. He also reached safely on an infield single in the sixth.	Corey Seager, voted into the All-Star Game by the players, continued his hot-hitting with an RBI single in the first. The rookie has hit safely in 19 of his last 21 games, batting .366 during the stretch.	The Dodgers fought off an anemic offense early in the season to go into the All-Star break a season-high 11 games over .500.	"For our guys it was just staying focused on winning each game, and not getting focused on what players are hurt, what people are saying about us," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. "There were a couple of stretches in there where we could have gone the other way."	Kenley Jansen pitched a scoreless ninth for his 27th save.	For the Padres, the three losses to end the first half left them 18-18 since June 1 and headed into the break needing to regroup.	"I thought it was just bad baseball," Padres manager Andy Green said. "There's nothing else to say. I thought we were somewhat listless offensively. We had opportunities to square up the baseball and didn't."	One Padre did, when Norris drove the first pitch he saw from Maeda with one out in the fifth over the left-field wall for his 12th homer.	Friedrich lost for the fourth time in five starts, giving up three runs and seven hits over five innings.	BULLPEN SESSION	Clayton Kershaw threw 25 pitches off a mound before the game and Roberts said there was "definitely encouraging" progress in the left-hander's rehab from a back injury.	The Dodgers have not set a timetable for the three-time Cy Young Award winner's return.	"He will not be in the rotation when we come back from the break," Roberts said	FIRST SERVE	Tennis player and Thousand Oaks resident Sam Querrey threw out the game's ceremonial first pitch.

DENVER -- Cameron Rupp's 465-foot home run was the team's longest in five years until Maikel Franco one-upped his teammate with a 471-foot shot an inning later.	Not a big deal, says Rupp. He's just happy it meant another win for the surging Philadelphia Phillies.	Rupp and Franco provided most of the pop, Zach Eflin got his second big league win and the Phillies beat the Colorado Rockies 10-3 on Sunday in their final game before the All-Star break.	Rupp's two-run homer in the seventh inning was the longest by a Phillies player since Ryan Howard hit a 470-foot shot on May 13, 2011. Franco's three-run shot in the eighth was the longest since Howard's 473-foot blast on September 18, 2009.	Rupp's home run is tied for ninth in the majors this season, per Statcast. Franco's is fourth.	"They all count the same," said Rupp, who tied a career high with four RBI. "They were both good ones."	Philadelphia has won 10 of 13 games.	Eflin (2-2) allowed two runs in six innings. He gave up seven hits, struck out three and walked two in his follow-up to a complete-game win against the Braves on Tuesday. Since allowing nine runs in his debut, Eflin has a 2.20 ERA in five starts.	"This Rockies team is a darn good hitting team, especially in Denver, and he handled them pretty well," Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said. "I was very pleased."	Philadelphia had five consecutive batters reach base and scored three runs with two outs in the third off starter Tyler Chatwood (8-5). Freddy Galvis and Franco singled and Tommy Joseph walked to load the bases. Cody Asche followed with a two-run single and Rupp added his first RBI single of the day to give the Phillies a 3-1 lead.	Rupp's second RBI was a single to center field off Chatwood to push the lead to 4-1 in the fifth. His third and fourth came off slumping reliever Jake McGee in the seventh.	Galvis' RBI single and Franco's home run extended the lead to 10-2 in the eighth.	Carlos Gonzalez homered, Nick Hundley hit a pair of doubles and Brandon Barnes tripled for Colorado. The Rockies have lost nine of 12.	"They just beat us," Hundley said. "They flat out played better than we did."	Trevor Story, who remained tied for the NL rookie record for most home runs before the All-Star break at 21, scored on Hundley's second double of the day in the sixth to trim the lead to 4-2 before the Phillies rallied for the next six runs.	Gonzalez hit his 19th home run of the season in the eighth.	Chatwood allowed four runs and needed 93 pitches to get through five innings. He walked three and struck out two in his first loss since coming off the disabled list with a mid-back strain July 5.	REVERSE ROBBERY	Tyler Goeddel got a taste of his own medicine when Barnes robbed him of a hit with a leaping grab in left field. Goeddel made a similar grab late Friday to help preserve a Phillies win.	EFLIN'S WALK STREAK SNAPPED	Eflin had not allowed a walk in his previous 21 innings before conceding a four-pitch pass to Charlie Blackmon to start his day.	STUMPF REINSTATED	LHP Daniel Stumpf, a rookie reliever for the Phillies, was reinstated from his 80-game suspension Sunday. Stumpf was suspended and placed on the restricted list April 14 after testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs.	TRAINER'S ROOM	PHILLIES: OF Odubel Herrera (foot) returned to the lineup after taking the night off Saturday. He will be the Phillies' lone representative at the All-Star Game on Sunday.	ROCKIES: LHP Chris Rusin (shoulder) threw three innings of a simulated game Sunday. ... OF Gerardo Parra (ankle) is running and will start adding baseball activity soon.	UP NEXT	PHILLIES: RHP Jeremy Hellickson (6-6, 3.92) will take the mound Friday after the All-Star break against the Mets. Hellickson has allowed one earned run in each of his last three starts, going six innings deep in each of them.	ROCKIES: LHP Jorge De La Rosa (5-6, 5.74 ERA) will start against the Braves on Friday. The 35-year-old allowed three runs in seven innings in a 5-1 loss to San Francisco on July 6.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.
