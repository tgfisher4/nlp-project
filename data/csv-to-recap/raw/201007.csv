DETROIT -- Johnny Damon, Miguel Cabrera and the Detroit Tigers had too much power for the Minnesota Twins.	Damon's three-run shot in the fifth inning was Detroit's fourth home run against Nick Blackburn, and the surging Tigers went on to beat Minnesota 7-4 Saturday.	Cabrera hit a two-run homer in the first, rookie Alex Avila and Magglio Ordonez followed with solo shots in each of the next two innings and Damon's drive gave the Tigers a four-run lead.	"We hit some mistakes pretty good," Detroit manager Jim Leyland said.	The AL Central leaders have won five straight overall and 17 of 19 at home. The Tigers are a season-high 11 games over .500 thanks to an AL-best home record of 32-12 that has made up for a 16-25 mark on the road. They've won seven straight series since late May.	"You're supposed to win at home," Cabrera said. "People come here to see you win. ... If we can win more on the road, I think we can win the division."	Even though the Tigers roughed up Blackburn and didn't have to face All-Star slugger Justin Morneau for the second straight game, they couldn't put the game out of reach.	Morneau will miss the All-Star game Tuesday night in Anaheim, Calif., because of a concussion. Cabrera will start in his place at first base.	"To play for somebody that is hurt, I don't like that," Cabrera said.	Morneau was evaluated by Dr. Kenneth Podell, a concussion specialist who consults with pro teams in Detroit, and was advised to rest in Minnesota during the break.	"You're always concerned about a head injury," Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said.	The third-place Twins have concerns on the field, too, losing four in a row and seven of nine. They led the division by 4 1/2 games less than a month ago and now trail Detroit by four games.	Minnesota fell to three games over .500 for the first time since April 14 when it was 6-3.	Starting pitching has been the biggest problem.	Blackburn (7-7) allowed seven runs and seven hits over four innings and matched a career high by giving up four homers. He is 1-6 in his last eight starts.	"I'm sick of this," Blackburn said. "Every time I go out there, I'm not getting the job done."	Jeremy Bonderman (5-6) gave up three runs in six innings for the win. All-Star closer Jose Valverde pitched a perfect ninth for his 19th straight save since blowing his first opportunity with the Tigers.	Minnesota made some slick plays defensively to keep it relatively close.	Third baseman Nick Punto stopped a shot in the hole, wheeled and threw home to prevent Austin Jackson from scoring in the first, an at-bat before Cabrera hit a line drive over the left-center fence.	The next inning, Punto went to his left to get another grounder and made a throw to first from behind the pitcher's mound one at-bat before Avila's homer.	Poor starting pitching, though, made the gems in the field moot for the slumping Twins.	"Another game where we give up an early touchdown and then have to spend the rest of the game fighting back," Gardenhire said a day after Francisco Liriano gave up seven runs in 1 2/3 innings. "When you give up early runs, you need the pitchers to put up some zeros to give the hitters a chance to get you back into the game, but we didn't do that again."	Orlando Hudson hit a two-run single in the third for Minnesota and Michael Cuddyer had a solo homer the next inning.	Jason Kubel, the only batter to face Tigers reliever Daniel Schlereth, hit a leadoff double in the seventh and scored on Delmon Young's grounder to make it 7-4.	Game notes	 Triple Crown candidate Cabrera has a career-high 18-game hitting streak. He is batting .346 with 22 homers and 76 RBIs -- the most by a Tigers player before the All-Star game since Cecil Fielder had one more prior to the 1993 break. ... Kevin Slowey, one of Minnesota's starters, pitched in relief for the first time since 2007. ... Minnesota's Carl Pavano and Detroit's Andy Oliver will start the series finale. ... Miss USA Rima Fakih, of Dearborn, Mich., threw out the ceremonial first pitch.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

LOS ANGELES -- Tom Gorzelanny got a chance to return to the Chicago Cubs' rotation because of teammate Carlos Zambrano's well-publicized blowup in the dugout. He has made the most of his second opportunity.	Gorzelanny won for the second time in three starts after spending almost all of last month pitching out of the bullpen, and the Cubs got home runs from Aramis Ramirez and Geovany Soto in a 7-3 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Saturday.	"It was a long month," said Gorzelanny, whose first stint in the rotation was a result of Zambrano's demotion to a relief role. "I didn't get to pitch a whole lot last month, but I did my job in the 'pen and just waited until my next opportunity to get back in the rotation. And that's what happened."	Gorzelanny (4-5) allowed two runs -- one earned -- and six hits over six innings after being staked to an early 6-0 lead. The left-hander, who lost to the Dodgers on May 26 at Wrigley Field, walked only one after issuing six walks over five innings last Monday at Arizona in a 9-4 victory.	"He's been doing a great job all year," teammate Marlon Byrd said. "He took his move to the 'pen like a champ, and now he's come back and shown why he wants to be in the rotation."	John Ely (4-7) threw 47 pitches over 2 1/3 innings in the shortest of his 14 big league starts, after lasting only 2 2/3 innings last Monday in a 6-5 loss to Florida at Dodger Stadium. The 24-year-old right-hander was charged with six runs, five hits and three walks -- one of them with the bases loaded.	"It was a struggle out there today," said batterymate A.J. Ellis, making his 13th start behind the plate. "He just couldn't get anything going and he had a hard time repeating pitches. That makes it tough when you're facing a major league lineup. Soto's home run took a lot of wind out of his sails and he had a hard time rebounding from that."	Ely has averaged 3.67 walks per nine innings over his last 10 starts, following a string of 89 consecutive batters in which he did not allow a base on balls.	"From what I saw today and in his last start, it's the inability to get the off-speed stuff over for strikes," Ellis said. "He'll be the first to let you know that he doesn't have velocity to rely on a fastball in the zone. He needs his off-speed stuff, and the last couple of times it just hasn't been there for him."	Ely is 1-6 with a 5.44 ERA in his past nine starts after recording his first three big league victories in consecutive outings.	"My confidence is never going to be hurt. I know what I've done in the past, I know what I can do," Ely said. "I'm going to focus on that. I'll have a couple off days here just to get my mind off of everything that's been happening, and I'm going to be ready next start. I'll come out of this. I guarantee it."	Ely's father, Jack, is such a devout Chicago White Sox fan that he has steadfastly refused to attend any games at Wrigley Field. So he wasn't on hand for his son's first game in Chicago as a big leaguer on May 27, when he limited the Cubs to a run and four hits over 7 1/3 innings and lost 1-0.	"The first time through the league, it's tough to figure out what a guy has, what kind of break his ball has, how he locates and what his out pitch is. Today we just tried to wait him out and get a good pitch up," Byrd said. "We learned a lot from his game in Chicago. He mixes his pitches very well, so guys tried to hit his fastball early in the count or wait for his changeup late in the count."	Byrd, who was 7 for 9 with three RBIs during the first two games of the series, drew a leadoff walk in the second and scored on Starlin Castro's single. Soto drove the next pitch into the left-field bullpen for his ninth homer.	"I always go up there looking fastball," Soto said. "He's got really good off-speed pitches and he knows how to use them. I had the pitcher hitting behind me, so I just wanted to get a good pitch to drive and help the club. We managed to get him early this time."	Six consecutive Cubs reached base during a three-run third after Ely got the first out. He hit Byrd on the left arm with a pitch before walking Alfonso Soriano with the bases loaded, then gave up RBI singles by Castro and Soto that extended Chicago's lead to 6-0. It could have been worse, but left fielder Xavier Paul threw out Byrd trying to score behind Ramirez on Castro's hit.	The Dodgers got on the board in the second. First-time All-Star Andre Ethier dumped a bloop single to left in front of a diving Soriano to score Paul, and Rafael Furcal followed him home on a throwing error to third by Byrd as he backed up Soriano on the play.	The rally began when Paul hit a grounder to first baseman Derrek Lee and umpire Jerry Layne ruled that Paul had beaten Gorzelanny in a foot race to the bag on a bang-bang play. Cubs manager Lou Piniella came out to argue. When the inning was over, Piniella came back on the field to pick up the argument and was ejected for the first time since Aug. 9, 2009.	"I got a pretty good view of the play from the dugout, and I thought the baserunner was out," Piniella said. "Jerry convinced me he wasn't, until one of my coaches saw the replay. I told him, `You missed the call,' and he said, `I can't hear you.' So he sort of baited me out there, but it's all right."	Ramirez got one of the runs back in the seventh with a first-pitch homer off Carlos Monasterios, who was making his first appearance since his start against Boston on June 18. He missed 14 games while on the disabled list because of a blister on his index finger.	Ethier capped the scoring in the ninth with another RBI single, this one off Carlos Marmol.	Game notes	Manny Ramirez, on a rehab assignment with Class A Inland Empire, is expected to be activated next Thursday at St. Louis after his second stint on the disabled list this season. ... Furcal was selected to replace injured Mets SS Jose Reyes on the NL All-Star roster.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

NEW YORK -- Tim Hudson stood in front of his locker in the Atlanta Braves' clubhouse Saturday, his feet bare as he buttoned up his shirt, and tried to argue that he didn't have his best stuff against the New York Mets.	Nobody was buying it.	Hudson allowed four hits over seven innings before turning it over to one of the toughest bullpens in baseball, and the Braves beat New York 4-0 to move five games ahead of their NL East rival with one game left before the All-Star break.	"I feel good about my start today," Hudson said. "I didn't feel great, but it was just one of those days where it bobbed and weaved."	Omar Infante, the Braves' jack-of-all trades All-Star, had three hits and drove in a run after getting four hits in the series opener, while Hudson (9-4) helped himself with a pair of hits that included an RBI double during a four-run fifth inning.	It all added up to Atlanta's fourth straight win, and a chance to sweep the series Sunday after losing three straight at Citi Field in late April. The Mets have lost back-to-back series at home for the first time since their first two of the season against Florida and Washington.	"They're all important. The last one was important, the next one is important," Braves manager Bobby Cox said. "It's good to be in first place going into the break."	As if losing ground in the division wasn't bad enough, the Mets also lost Jose Reyes after he made a difficult fielding play in the seventh inning.	The All-Star shortstop hurt himself ranging to his right to grab a grounder by Troy Glaus and making a long throw to first base. Reyes has been hampered by a sore right side that has prevented the switch-hitter from batting left-handed the last few games.	"It's been bothering me," said Reyes, who will be replaced by the Dodgers' Rafael Furcal at the All-Star game on Tuesday in Anaheim, Calif.	"I tried to play through it," he added. "I think the next couple of days, rest for me I think is going to help a lot."	The Braves got all their offense against Mike Pelfrey (10-4) in the fifth, chasing him with five straight singles to open the inning. Hudson's two-out RBI double off Elmer Dessens made it 4-0, dooming the Mets to their third straight home loss for the first time this season.	"It's not good," said David Wright, who went 0-for-3. "They pitched better than us today, they hit better than us today, they played better defense. They came out and just beat us in every area of the game."	Pelfrey had been dominant through his first 15 starts, enough so that many thought he deserved to be included on the NL All-Star roster. But the big right-hander has been abysmal since, giving up 15 runs over 13 1/3 innings and twice allowing a career-high 12 hits.	All 12 of Atlanta's hits off Pelfrey in this one were singles. He allowed 15 of his 25 batters to reach base and hasn't lasted more than six innings since June 19.	"He's at a low wall right now," Mets manager Jerry Manuel said. "The break comes at a good time for him. He'll probably have close to six or seven days off."	The damage could have been even worse against the Braves, who loaded the bases in the second and fourth against Pelfrey but had nothing to show for it. Atlanta left 13 on base.	Angel Pagan had three of the Mets' four hits, and is creating a nice problem for Manuel. He's been swinging one of the team's best bats, but will lose his everyday spot in center field when Carlos Beltran comes off the disabled list after the All-Star break.	Pagan was just about all the offense New York could muster against Hudson, though.	The 34-year-old right-hander has recovered from Tommy John surgery two years ago to re-establish himself as one of the best pitchers in baseball. He's lasted at least seven innings in each of his last seven starts, one of the main reasons he was picked to his first All-Star team since 2004.	"He's had a great first half," Cox said. "I know he's lost a couple of heartbreakers, but he's been great. He's been strong."	Game notes	 Mets SS Luis Castillo (bruised right heel) will begin a rehab stint with Class-A St. Lucie on Sunday. RHP John Maine (right shoulder weakness) will begin throwing to hitters next week. ... Braves 3B Chipper Jones (back spasms) started after being a late scratch Friday night. ... Reyes nearly hit Hudson with his bat when he let go while flailing at a pitch in the sixth.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.	Jhoulys Chacín has agreed to a guaranteed $1.25 million, one-year contract with the Rockies.

CHICAGO -- Paul Konerko got a standing ovation to start the third inning and tucked it away as another memorable moment in his 12-year career with the Chicago White Sox.	"That was cool," said Konerko, who was cheered after the crowd learned he'd been added to the AL All-Star team.	But the individual honor wasn't nearly as impressive to Konerko as what his team has been able to do over the last month.	Gavin Floyd's strong pitching and two homers by Carlos Quentin led the White Sox past the Kansas City Royals 5-1 Saturday night -- Chicago's seventh straight win and 24th victory in the last 29 games.	In early June, it looked like the White Sox's season would pretty much be over because they were playing so poorly and had fallen nine games under .500 .	Now, they're a half-game out of first and 10 games over.	"I've never seen a turnaround like this," Konerko said. "I don't think anybody saw this coming."	Gordon Beckham, who has struggled most of the season, also homered for the White Sox.	Floyd (5-7), who left after Jason Kendall's third single of the game with two outs in the eighth, gave up six hits and a run. David DeJesus ruined the shutout bid with an RBI double off reliever Matt Thornton.	Chicago pitching has allowed just three runs in the last three games. And Floyd is now 3-1 in his last seven starts with a 1.07 ERA.	"We're clicking," Floyd said. "Hopefully tomorrow we can take that game and go into the All-Star break and enjoy a little relaxation and get back on it."	Quentin hit his 16th homer leading off the second inning against Brian Bannister. Beckham lined his third of the season over the left field fence to start the bottom of the fifth and make it 2-0. Omar Vizquel singled one out later and raced home when Konerko hit an RBI double to left with the ball momentarily rolling under the fence but still in play.	K.C. left fielder Scott Podsednik retrieved the ball and relayed it to third baseman Alberto Callaspo, whose high throw was too late to get Vizquel. The throwing error allowed Konerko to move up a base and came one inning after brief but steady rain showers.	"You're trying to see if it's a dead ball or what's going on," Bannister said. "I know it was wet under there and the ball came out wet so that was a frustrating play for everybody."	Quentin then followed with his second homer of the game and third of the night off Bannister to make it 5-0.	"I gave up a few hits here and there, but it was really just Quentin," Bannister said. "He changed the game."	Bannister (7-7) gave up seven hits and five runs in six innings and is now 1/3 with a 9.00 ERA against the White Sox this season. The three homers ran his total to 18 surrendered in 18 starts this season.	Game notes	 RHP Daniel Hudson is slated to be called up from Triple-A Charlotte and make Sunday's start for Chicago in place of injured Jake Peavy. Hudson was 1-1 in six games, including two starts, last season for the White Sox. After Saturday night's game, the White Sox cleared a roster spot by optioning reliever Jeff Marquez to Charlotte. ... Konerko, who was one of five finalists in the fan online voting contest for the final spot that was won by Nick Swisher, was named to the AL squad after the Twins' Justin Morneau was forced to drop out because of a concussion. "I really didn't get too much emotionally involved," Konerko said. "I've been down this road. I've made teams and didn't make teams. You have to kinda look at it as a win-win and I did the whole time." ... Jose Guillen (strained left quad) was back in the Royals' lineup Saturday after sitting out the last two games. He was the DH and limped into second base after hitting a fifth-inning double. He left for a pinch-hitter in the seventh.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

HOUSTON -- Brett Myers has lasted at least six innings in each of his starts this season.	On Saturday night he had much bigger goals.	Myers added another quality start to his strong season, pitching eight crisp innings to help the Houston Astros beat the St. Louis Cardinals 4-1.	Myers (6-6) gave up one run and five hits, struck out five and walked none. He extended his club record of starts of six innings or more to begin the season to 18 and is the only pitcher in the majors to achieve the mark in every start since the season began.	"You don't get many opportunities to throw complete games so you want to take them when you can get them," he said. "I should have just ran out there [in the ninth] and embarrassed everybody. That would have been funny."	Pedro Feliz hit a two-run single in Houston's three-run first and Jeff Keppinger went deep for the Astros.	Jeff Suppan (0-5) allowed four runs and seven hits in 4 2/3 innings for St. Louis.	Keppinger's one-out double helped set up Houston's big first inning. With two outs and the bases loaded, Feliz singled to left and Humberto Quintero drove in Hunter Pence with a base hit to make it 3-0.	Myers was happy his team got him an early lead.	"It definitely relaxes you a little bit, especially with the lineup that they have over there with Pujols and Holliday and the other guys they have to make things happen for them to score runs," he said. "So it's always good to be able to go out there and have a little cushion so you can get in a rhythm and start pitching."	Keppinger connected in the fifth, hitting a one-out drive to left to give Houston a 4-1 lead. It was Keppinger's third homer of the season.	That was enough for Myers, who retired nine of his last 10 batters. Matt Lindstrom issued two walks in the ninth before striking out rookie Jon Jay for his 21st save in 25 opportunities.	Manager Brad Mills said Myers has been one of the bright spots in his team's tough season.	"There's no doubt," Mills said. "With all his quality starts and how deep he's gone into games. He came here with a reputation of being an innings eater and I think now he's gone and almost taken it to another level. The way he's gone about it is very special."	Albert Pujols and Jay each had two hits for St. Louis. Jay extended his hitting streak to a National League-best 10 games.	Pujols tripled and scored on Holliday's groundout in the fourth. It was the first triple for Pujols since last July and the 15th of his career.	"We got one run, but we needed to do more, even though Myers pitched well," Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said. "He made a lot of good pitches, but we have a lot of good hitters.You give him credit, no doubt about it. But at the same time we have a lot of good hitters, so we always feel like we can break through and do something more than one run. But we didn't."	After Suppan departed, Mitchell Boggs pitched 2 1/3 scoreless innings for St. Louis and Jason Motte threw a perfect eighth.	Game notes	 Houston RHP Felipe Paulino, on the disabled list with right shoulder tendinitis, is scheduled to make a rehabilitation start for Double-A Corpus Christi on Tuesday. He is expected to throw between 60-65 pitches. ... St. Louis OF Colby Rasmus, who left the game in the middle of the eighth inning on Friday night with tightness in his right hamstring, was out of the starting lineup.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

WASHINGTON -- Buster Posey showed the Washington Nationals what it's like to be beaten by a rookie.	A night after Nationals phenom Stephen Strasburg shut down the Giants, Posey hit a tiebreaking single in a four-run seventh inning and added a two-run homer that withstood a video review to lead San Francisco to a 10-5 victory over Washington on Saturday night.	Brought in to protect a 5-4 lead in the seventh, Tyler Clippard (8-6) allowed Aaron Rowand's one-out homer to left on a 3-2 changeup. Freddy Sanchez and Aubrey Huff walked, and both were running when Posey sent a single through the hole between first and second to put the Giants ahead.	"Full count, I was just battling," said Posey, who had his second career four-hit game in four nights. "I knew from watching some previous at-bats, [Clippard] had a lot of confidence in his changeup, and I knew if I was going to get beat, I didn't want to get beat with the changeup."	Juan Uribe then hit a two-run double to right-center for an 8-5 lead.	Clippard has been a dependable setup man, and leads the Nationals' pitching staff in victories, but is 0-3 with 11 runs allowed in his last 6 1/3 innings over seven appearances.	"Tyler's just struggling. ... He's gotten hurt a little bit with his changeup," Washington manager Jim Riggleman said. "He's got a great changeup, but word gets around the league a little bit and every now and then maybe a hitter's looking for it."	In the ninth, Posey hit a drive to right-center off Miguel Batista that was bobbled and caught by a fan in the first row wearing a Giants cap. The fan appeared to reach over the railing, but the umpires used a three-minute review to uphold the call.	"It wasn't a great feeling," Posey said of the brief stoppage. "I really didn't want to go out there to second base, so I was glad it held up."	It was Posey's seventh homer since being recalled from Triple-A Fresno on May 29 -- and his sixth in 10 days. In July, the 23-year-old is hitting .514 and has 13 RBIs.	"I try not to have too many expectations," he said. "I try to set myself a goal, whether it's for a year or a week or a day -- just go out and play as hard as I can and the results take care of themselves."	From behind the plate, Posey also made two key defensive plays in the sixth to short-circuit a Washington rally. He threw out pinch-runner Roger Bernadina at third as he tried to advance on Ian Desmond's attempted sacrifice and later nabbed Desmond trying to steal third.	"Big play. We were in a bit of a jam there and [Posey] made a great throw to third [on the bunt]," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "He batted well with runners in motion, he found a hole. And at the end, those were big runs to tack on."	On the one-year anniversary of his no-hitter against San Diego, Giants left-hander Jonathan Sanchez lasted only 3 2/3 innings, yielding five hits and five runs. He walked two and struck out six in his shortest outing of the year.	Santiago Casilla (2-2) got the final two outs of the sixth.	Uribe also had three RBIs for San Francisco, which has won six of eight games.	Sanchez's wildness spotted the Nationals a 2-0 first-inning lead. Justin Maxwell and Cristian Guzman drew walks before an RBI double by Ryan Zimmerman. Sanchez's wild pitch scored Guzman.	Sanchez helped himself out with a two-run single off Craig Stammen that gave the Giants a 3-2 lead in the second. With runners on first and second, Nate Schierholtz doubled into the right-field corner, scoring a run, and Sanchez followed with a single to center.	Mike Morse homered to center leading off the Nationals second.	Washington chased Sanchez in a two-run fourth. Josh Willingham legged out an infield single and scored on a double to left by Ivan Rodriguez. With two down, Stammen's ground-rule double made it 5-3 and Sanchez was pulled.	Stammen departed in the sixth after Uribe's sacrifice fly got San Francisco to 5-4. The right-hander yielded four runs and six hits.	Game notes	 Washington ended a franchise record streak by not allowing a first-inning run for the first time in 10 games. ... Maxwell was recalled from Triple-A Syracuse before the game. ... Uribe (sprained left ring finger) returned to the Giants lineup after missing four games, but OF Andres Torres (left groin tightness) sat out. ... Nationals C Jesus Flores, who has been on the disabled list all season while rehabilitating a right shoulder injury, has been shut down until after the All-Star break because he is experiencing pain, said general manager Mike Rizzo.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

PHILADELPHIA -- Travis Wood was three outs away from nine perfect innings.	Against Phillies ace Roy Halladay, that wasn't even enough for a win.	Wood took a perfect game into the ninth before giving up Carlos Ruiz's leadoff double, and Philadelphia stunned the Cincinnati Reds again by winning 1-0 Saturday night on Jimmy Rollins' RBI single in the 11th.	"That's why you come out and play 'em until it's over," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said. "You put everything into it."	Making his third big league start, Wood dominated Philadelphia's injury-depleted lineup and matched zeros for nine innings with Halladay, who threw a perfect game of his own May 29 in Florida.	The 23-year-old left-hander was trying for the third perfecto in the majors this year -- not to mention the one Detroit right-hander Armando Galarraga was denied because of a missed call at first base by umpire Jim Joyce.	The only other time there have been two perfect games in one season was 1880.	Ruiz, just off the disabled list, opened the ninth with a line drive to deep left-center that landed cleanly in the alley. Wood stayed in, however, and worked out of the jam. Pinch-hitter Wilson Valdez fouled out trying to bunt, pinch-hitter Raul Ibanez flied out and Rollins fouled out, sending the scoreless game to extra innings.	That was it for Wood, who struck out eight and walked none while throwing 74 of 109 pitches for strikes. He was relieved by Nick Masset in the 10th.	"I tried not to think about it too much," Wood said. "I just tried to go after one hitter at a time and not think about it. I'd take the pitch back to Ruiz. Maybe make it a little better."	With one out in the 11th, Ruiz hit another double, this one off Bill Bray (0-1). Valdez was intentionally walked and pinch-hitter Ross Gload flied out before Rollins lined a single to right off Logan Ondrusek, easily scoring Ruiz.	"We battled. It just wasn't our night," Wood said. "We're putting together good ballgames, we're just coming up a little bit short."	It's the first time the Phillies have had three straight walk-off wins in extra innings. They scored six times in the ninth to tie the game Friday night and won on Ryan Howard's two-run homer in the 10th. Brian Schneider hit a game-ending homer in the 12th on Thursday night, also against the NL Central-leading Reds.	"The last two days have been tough to take," Reds manager Dusty Baker said.	Jose Contreras (4-3) earned the victory in this one by striking out two in a scoreless inning.	Beaten out for the fifth starter's job by Mike Leake in spring training, Wood returned to take the rotation spot previously held by Homer Bailey and Sam LeCure.	"I got sent down and I just went down there and got my stuff together," Wood said. "Just did what I had to do to get back up here."	Wood, who made his big league debut July 1 against the Chicago Cubs, went to three balls only three times Saturday -- to Ben Francisco, Cody Ransom and Jayson Werth.	Before the ninth, the closest the Phillies came to a hit was in the fourth, when third baseman Miguel Cairo jumped to snag Shane Victorino's liner. Francisco lined a ball hard in the eighth, but right at left fielder Jonny Gomes.	"Their guys pitched equally well," Wood said.	Halladay struck out nine and walked one in his last outing before he heads to the All-Star game. His ERA dropped to 2.19.	He knew all about the pressure Wood experienced during his attempt at perfection.	"It's obviously a close game and you want to keep it that way and put as much pressure on them as you can," Halladay said. "It's probably a lot harder going in 0-0 then if you have a lead. We kept the pressure on."	Colorado's Ubaldo Jimenez and Arizona's Edwin Jackson also have thrown no-hitters this season.	Tom Browning is the only Reds pitcher to pitch a perfect game, when he beat the Dodgers 1-0 on Sept. 16, 1988. Browning was also the last Reds pitcher to toss nine scoreless innings and get a no-decision.	Halladay denied the Reds any real chance to score, allowing five hits in nine innings. He let only one runner reach third base, but escaped that jam by striking out Ryan Hanigan and Wood.	"To have a well-pitched game against us and still come out with a win is huge," Halladay said.	Game notes	 C Dane Sardinha was designated for assignment before the game to make roster room for Ruiz. ... Phillies 3B Placido Polanco will head to Clearwater, Fla., on Sunday and begin a minor league rehab assignment. ... Reds 3B Scott Rolen missed his second straight game with a stiff back.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Matt Garza's week ended a lot better than it started.	Garza allowed one hit over six innings, Gabe Kapler hit a two-run single and the Tampa Bay Rays beat the Cleveland Indians 4-0 on Saturday night.	Garza (10-5), who struck out two and walked one during an 88-pitch outing, was on a pitch count of around 90 after he worked out of the bullpen earlier in the week. The lone hit off Garza was a one-out, second-inning single by Jhonny Peralta, who is 9 for 19 overall against the right-hander.	"I think I had more intensity," Garza said. "I set a goal and I knew what my limitations were, so I had to stay under control and get that done."	Grant Balfour, Joaquin Benoit and Lance Cormier completed a three-hitter for the Rays, who have won 9-of-11.	"Our offense was completely shutdown. Their pitching deserves the credit," Cleveland manager Manny Acta said. "He's [Garza] one of those guys that any day can shutdown any offense. It's not like we're the '27 Yankees, but he's got pretty good stuff and it showed today."	Garza made his first relief appearance in three years and recorded his first career save by getting two outs to close Wednesday's 6-4 win over Boston. He was cast in that role because All-Star closer Rafael Soriano had worked the previous four days and Garza lasted just three innings in his start Monday.	"It's a very emotional week," Tampa Bay manager Joe Maddon said. "It's very unusual these days. You might have seen that in 1957, possibly, or maybe 1948, but it's rare to see in 2010."	Kapler put the Rays ahead 2-0 with his hit in the fourth. Willy Aybar's fifth-inning run-scoring single made it 3-0 and Jason Bartlett had an RBI double in the eighth.	Indians designated hitter Travis Hafner departed after three innings because of left upper back stiffness. Acta said Hafner won't play Sunday, which had already been set as an off-day for the DH.	Aaron Laffey (1-3) gave up three runs and seven hits over 5 2/3 innings.	"For the most part I threw the ball well," Laffey said. "I just got into some trouble with two outs there in the fourth and fifth."	Tampa Bay All-Star third baseman Evan Longoria hit into double plays in the first and third innings. He had grounded into just four double plays in his previous 85 games this season.	Longoria dived to his left and caught Andy Marte's grounder to start a ninth-inning double play.	Plate umpire Tim Welke stayed in the game after being hit hard in the mask by Jason Donald's foul in the fifth. Later in the at-bat, Garza caught a liner hit by Donald.	"That wasn't a catch. ... the ball caught him," Maddon said. "It was self defense. Fortunately it hit him in the glove and not somewhere else."	Game notes	 Maddon has setup his rotation for after the All-Star break. James Shields will start the opening game of a three-game series at the AL East-leading New York Yankees on Friday and will be followed by Jeff Niemann and David Price. Wade Davis and Garza will pitch in the following series with Baltimore. ... The Indians designated C Mike Redmond for assignment and recalled C Chris Gimenez from Triple-A Columbus. ... Rays LF Carl Crawford, who has battled left shoulder soreness recently, was the DH. Maddon said it is a preventive move. ... Indians SS Asdrubal Cabrera (broken left forearm) remains on target to start a minor league rehab assignemnt on Monday. ... Cleveland C Carlos Santana, hit on the left forearm by a pitch in the first, remained in the game and afterward said everything is OK.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- Cliff Lee gave the Texas Rangers the kind of complete effort they were hoping for, even though their newly acquired ace left-hander fell behind quickly and lost his debut.	Lee gave up a run when Baltimore had two hits on his first two pitches while Chris Tillman took a no-hitter into the seventh and the Orioles hit home runs in three consecutive innings for a 6-1 victory over the AL West-leading Rangers on Saturday night.	"It was an electric atmosphere. They got a lead early and never lost it. That kind of kills that a little bit," Lee said. "They came out swinging. You have to tip your hat to them for their approach."	Lee, the 2008 AL Cy Young winner the Rangers got from Seattle in a six-player deal Friday, still threw his AL-best sixth complete game.	"It was just one of those weird games, every swing they took turned into a run somehow," said Ian Kinsler, the Rangers' All-Star second baseman.	"Cliff showed exactly what he's capable of doing," Michael Young said. "He had to be tired from all the travel and all that's been going on for the last couple of days, but he showed exactly what he's capable of giving us. ... We're all excited about what we have."	Kinsler had a one-out single in the seventh to break up the no-hit bid by Tillman (1-3), who was recalled from Triple-A Norfolk to start in place of injured former Rangers starter Kevin Millwood (strained right forearm).	The acquisition of Lee despite the Rangers' bankruptcy proceedings and uncertain ownership sent a clear message that they want to make a serious run at their first playoff appearance since 1999. The All-Star pitcher was one of the most coveted players on the market, and Texas beat the New York Yankees and numerous other teams in getting him.	A crowd of 41,093 -- including a Rangers' record of 14,300 tickets sold on game day -- came to watch Lee (8-4), who had his fourth complete game in his last five starts. He threw 95 pitches while allowing nine hits with two strikeouts and no walks after arriving from Seattle around 1 a.m. Saturday.	"It's been a little hectic. ... I don't think that was the reason why I didn't do as well," Lee said. "It is what it is. The first one is out of the way and hopefully I can do better from here on out."	Lee's first pitch for Texas was lined toward the right-field corner by Corey Patterson for a double. Miguel Tejada had an RBI single on the next pitch.	After that, Lee needed only 23 pitches to get nine outs. But Nick Markakis led off the fourth by pulling a pitch down the right-field line for the first of Baltimore's homers. Cesar Izturis, the No. 9 hitter, had a solo shot for his first of the season in the fifth, and Adam Jones hit a two-run drive an inning later to make it 5-0.	Lee was 4-0 with a 1.29 ERA his last four starts for last-place Seattle, including three complete games and an eight-inning performance in the other.	Baltimore (28-59), which has the majors' worst record, has won the first three games of the final series before the All-Star break. It is the Orioles' first road series victory this season.	"To come in here and win a series against this team is outstanding," interim manager Juan Samuel said. "I told the guys we might as well go for it. Our hitters attacked the ball early. Against a pitcher like Cliff Lee, you have to attack early."	Meanwhile, Tillman (1-3) allowed two singles and an unearned run in his career-high 7 1/3 innings. It was the 17th career start for the 21-year-old right-hander, who was had an 8.40 ERA in other four starts for Baltimore earlier this season.	"He threw the ball well, it doesn't really happen to us very often where we get shut down like that," Young said.	Texas didn't have a base runner until Elvis Andrus drew a leadoff walk in the fourth, when he then avoided being picked off only because of an interference call against first baseman Jake Fox in the rundown. Andrus dived back short of first base, then started crawling toward the bag before getting up and running the other way.	The first Texas hit came on Kinsler's sharp single through the left side of the infield.	David Murphy led off the seventh with a sinking single to center field that ricocheted off and past Jones for a two-base error. Murphy scored on a wild pitch before Tillman was relieved by Will Ohman with one out.	Game notes	 Rangers slugger Josh Hamilton finished 0 for 4, ending his 29-game home hitting streak. That fell one short of the franchise record. Al Oliver hit in 30 consecutive home games at Arlington Stadium, where Texas played before moving into Rangers Ballpark in 1994. ... The fireworks show scheduled Friday night that was canceled by order of the city after that rain-delayed game didn't end until 1:25 a.m. local time, was held Saturday night.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PHOENIX -- Chris Snyder thought the ball was going out, only to see left fielder Chris Coghlan pull it back from the crowd.	On his next swing, just an inning later, Snyder made sure Coghlan couldn't reach it.	Snyder hit a two-run homer over Arizona's bullpen in the sixth inning and Stephen Drew sparked the offense from the top of the order, lifting the Diamondbacks to a bizarre 5-4 win over the Florida Marlins on Saturday night.	"When I hit it, I thought it had a chance, but Coghlan thought he had a chance," Snyder said. "Not the second one. He wasn't getting the second."	Mark Reynolds hit his 20th homer, Ian Kennedy (4-7) ended a five-game losing streak and Drew scored two runs after early walks by Nate Robertson (6-7) as Arizona earned its second win in eight games.	Prized rookie Mike Stanton did his best to keep Florida in the game, hitting a solo drive over the pool in right-center in the fifth. He also doubled in the ninth to set up Ronny Paulino's two-run single off Chad Qualls that cut it to 5-4.	Juan Gutierrez then closed it out, getting a popup and a double play for his second save in four chances.	"Guti picked up Qualls and that's what you're supposed to do," Arizona manager Kirk Gibson said. "When somebody stumbles a little bit, you go and pick them up."	Two middling teams facing each other in front of a small crowd in the air conditioning didn't figure to be all that thrilling.	Turned out to be a sometimes-strange game that included colliding infielders, a ball bounding from one fielder to another and the home team's closer getting booed off the field.	The theme was a portend of the bizarreness to come: '80s day at Chase Field for two teams that didn't exist until the '90s.	Wang Chung, Wham! and Nena videos replaced the usual mix of rock, rap and country during batting practice.	A pregame parade included the "A Team" with a scrawny Mr. T, the "Ghostbusters" ambulance and a Delorean driven by a linebacker-looking guy who was supposed be Marty McFly from "Back to the Future."	Diamondbacks players had whacky wigs superimposed on their heads or their faces on album covers on the video screen during at-bats, while Pacman sound effects played on strikeouts, Frogger noises on walks.	The fans even got into it, breaking into the seldom-seen-anymore wave in the bottom of the sixth inning just before Darth Vader and a group of Stormtroopers began wandering the aisles.	"It was an interesting day," Gutierrez said.	The game, at times, matched the peripheral peculiarity.	Arizona had a rare 5-6-3 putout in the fourth inning, when Cody Ross' liner bounded out of Reynolds' glove right to Drew at shortstop.	Florida first baseman Gaby Sanchez and second baseman Dan Uggla botched a popup in the fifth inning when they collided, but still got the forceout at second.	An inning earlier, Coghlan did a retro impression of Ken Griffey Jr., leaping to haul in Snyder's drive just over the wall. Of course, the next homer came from Snyder, who made sure Coghlan had no chance with a shot to left that gave the Diamondbacks a 5-2 lead.	"There were a lot of little things in this game," said Robertson, who allowed five runs and six hits in six innings. "There were way too many little things."	The drama wasn't quite over.	Qualls came in for the ninth in Arizona's first save opportunity since June 30 and promptly bobbled Ross' chopper off the plate for an error. Stanton doubled to start the booing and Paulino followed with his single, leading to louder jeers.	After initially hesitating, Gibson eventually came out to get Qualls, a move that drew cheers but turned to a chorus of boos as the right-hander walked off.	Gutierrez made sure the mayhem ended there, getting pinch-hitter Wes Helms to pop out and Coghlan on a game-ending double play to give the struggling Diamondbacks a much-needed win.	"It's to get any kind of win," said Kennedy, who allowed two runs and five hits in 5 1/3 innings for his first win since June 9.	Game notes	 Arizona 1B Adam LaRoche sat out with a stiff back. ... Stanton's homer was his fifth. ... Greg Schulte, radio voice of the Diamondbacks, called his 2,000th career game.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- The Oakland Athletics have had few nights like this in a first half of the season where scoring runs consistently has been difficult.	Few pitchers have ever had the kind of night Scott Kazmir endured for the Los Angeles Angels.	Rajai Davis capped Oakland's biggest inning of the season with a grand slam and the Athletics handed Kazmir the worst pounding ever for an Angels pitcher in a 15-1 victory over Los Angeles on Saturday night.	Kazmir (7-9) allowed eight runs in the third inning and five more in the fifth, capped by back-to-back homers by Coco Crisp and Daric Barton.	"Today is a tough one to swallow," Kazmir said. "I can't have too much confidence after a game like this."	The 13 runs are the most allowed by an Angels pitcher, topping the 11 Scott Schoeneweis gave up against Baltimore on May 23, 2001. It was the most in the majors since St. Louis' Jason Marquis allowed 13 to the Chicago White Sox on June 21, 2006.	The offensively challenged A's broke out in a big way this night after scoring only 19 runs in the previous seven games. Davis, who entered the game in a 2-for-31 slump, added two doubles, a single and a career-high five RBIs. Crisp drove in four runs to help Oakland snap a four-game losing streak and reach a season-high in runs.	"Three home runs is good for any team. It's a real solid night for us," manager Bob Geren said. "We haven't done that too often, obviously. It's just guys getting the good part of the bat on the ball."	Ben Sheets (4-8), who came into the game with the fourth worst run support in the American League, was the beneficiary of the outburst. He pitched six scoreless innings to win for just the second time in his last eight starts. The A's had scored one or fewer runs in eight of his previous 18 starts.	Davis started the big third inning with a double, stole third and scored on a wild pitch. Crisp hit a popup that landed between right fielder Bobby Abreu and second baseman Howie Kendrick for an RBI single and the inning took a bad turn for the Angels when Adam Rosales hit a two-out single to center with runners on first and second.	Torii Hunter made a strong throw home and Mike Napoli made a swipe tag that appeared to get Barton. Plate umpire Ted Barrett ruled that Napoli missed the tag, much to the dismay of manager Mike Scioscia, who came charging out of the dugout to argue.	"Mike thought he tagged him," Scioscia said. "I haven't seen the replay. I know the inning got away from us after that but changing the dynamic of any one inning is not going to change anything tonight. They scored 15 runs."	After an intentional walk to Mark Ellis loaded the bases, Kazmir walked Ryan Sweeney to force in the fourth run. Davis followed with a drive into the left-field seats for Oakland's first grand slam of the season. It was also the team's biggest inning, topping a seven-run seventh inning against Pittsburgh on June 25.	Kazmir stayed in the game and ran into more trouble in the fifth. He allowed an RBI double to Davis and then a three-run homer to Crisp. Barton hit the next pitch out for Oakland's second back-to-back homers of the season, snapping an 0-for-20 streak that matched the worst of his career.	"It was amazing," Davis said. "You see one thing and you can't take your eyes off the game because another thing is happening, especially in the third inning when we scored all those runs. It was exciting to watch and something we look forward to doing more."	Kazmir allowed 13 runs and 11 hits in five innings, the fourth straight start he has allowed more runs than innings pitched. He has a 13.73 ERA in that span, raising his mark on the season to 6.92.	Scioscia said he kept Kazmir in so long because he needed the innings from his starter.	"Kaz was struggling. We'll keep pushing until he gets it right," Scioscia said. "He'll be in the rotation when the second half starts. If we have to make a move we'll consider it but we're not there yet. ... He's still going to be very important for us."	Sheets, who had allowed a major league worst 54 extra-base hits coming into the game, seemed on his way to another rough night early. Kendrick hit a one-out double in the first and Abreu then drove a ball to deep center that looked as if it could go out. But Crisp made a leaping grab before crashing against the wall for the second out.	Sheets settled down after that, allowing only one more hit despite sitting during two long innings when the A's were at the plate.	"It was long," Sheets said. "I don't think I ever got my stuff totally back. I went out there and just tried to make pitches."	Game notes	 Kazmir had allowed only one earned run in his previous three starts against the A's. ... Davis' only other grand slam came on Sept. 5, 2008, against Baltimore. ... Cory Aldridge hit an RBI triple in the eighth for his first career hit in his 14th professional season. ... Oakland LHP Dallas Braden (left elbow stiffness) threw a side session on flat ground before the game. Geren said he could make a rehab start July 15 and return to the majors July 20 if there are no further setbacks.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

SEATTLE -- While the throng crowded around Jose Lopez's locker, Felix Hernandez made sure he was heard over anyone else in the Seattle clubhouse.	"Jose Lopez! Thank you man, I appreciate it!" Hernandez shouted.	Lopez hit his second career grand slam off Joba Chamberlain in the eighth inning, and Hernandez outlasted Javier Vazquez to lead the Mariners to a come-from-behind 4-1 victory over the New York Yankees on Saturday night.	Held hitless into the sixth inning by Vazquez, the Mariners offense came alive against the Yankees burly reliever, and Hernandez (7-5) earned his third straight complete-game victory against New York, which had its season-best seven-game winning streak snapped.	Seattle loaded the bases against Chamberlain (1-4) on a fielder's choice by Ichiro Suzuki, single by Chone Figgins and intentional walk to Russell Branyan.	Lopez then caught up with Chamberlain's rising 96 mph fastball, sending a drive to left field that barely cleared the hand operated scoreboard. It was his sixth homer and second grand slam this season.	"I was trying to bring one run in. That was my first point, to tie the game," Lopez said. "When it got 2-0 I think in my mind that I have to swing hard. He was going to come in with a fastball and he throws hard, he throws like 96, 97. I tried to catch a fastball and I did."	Chamberlain said he felt bad for wasting Vazquez's effort.	"Most of the times when we've had the leads he has done a good job," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "Tonight he struggled, it was with his command and we'll just keep working at it."	And Lopez's shot gave Hernandez another accolade in his already memorable young career. Hernandez, the lone ace remaining in Seattle, became the first pitcher in 19 years to throw three straight complete games against the Yankees, according to the Mariners. Jaime Navarro was the last to do so in the 1990-91 seasons.	Justin Smoak's debut with Seattle was mostly forgettable. Smoak was the centerpiece, from Seattle's standpoint, of the trade that sent Cliff Lee and Mark Lowe to Texas for Smoak and three minor leaguers. Arriving in Seattle about six hours before gametime, Smoak struck out three times and was hitless in his Mariners debut.	Closing out the Yankees didn't come easily for Hernandez. Curtis Granderson led off the ninth with a double and pinch-hitter Derek Jeter reached on an infield single, but Hernandez struck out Colin Curtis, Jorge Posada and Brett Gardner, all looking to finish off the victory.	Hernandez screamed in excitement and slapped his glove after Gardner was frozen by a breaking ball to finish off a third straight dominating performance against the Yankees.	"That's one reason why Felix should have been an All-Star," Seattle manager Don Wakamatsu said. "To go out and see that performance ... to see him compete the way he did, it's one of those games, even though we have [David] Aardsma down there in the bullpen, he wasn't going to be denied."	Two weeks ago, Hernandez tossed a two-hitter at Yankee Stadium. His previous outing against the Yankees was in September, when he allowed one earned run and got the victory when Suzuki homered off Mariano Rivera in the bottom of the ninth.	Hernandez wasn't as overpowering on Saturday, scattering 10 hits and struck out nine. It was Hernandez's 11th complete game, fourth of the season and third in his last five starts.	The 24-year-old said he doesn't mind not going to the All-Star game this year. It gives him time to move into his new home in Seattle.	"I'm good. It's not my decision. ... I get to spend three days here and that's good for me," Hernandez said.	Nick Swisher hit a solo homer in the third -- his 15th of the season on the day he was added to the Home Run Derby.	Vazquez was the story for much of the night, flirting with a no-hitter into the sixth inning and making Seattle's offense look foolish at times. Vazquez struck out seven in seven innings and being pulled after 117 pitches.	Other than a first-inning walk to Branyan, Vazquez kept Seattle off the bases, retiring 15 straight until Suzuki stepped up in the sixth. His golfed liner appeared to hit Vazquez in the thigh, but the pitcher scrambled and made a rushed throw to first that Mark Teixeira could not scoop. An accurate throw at first would have gotten Suzuki.	"Sincerely, with all might heart, I never think 'no-hitter,'" Vazquez said. "If ti happens, it happens, but I don't think about it."	An inning later, Lopez rolled a single up the middle and Franklin Gutierrez followed with a sharp single to left. The Mariners loaded the bases but Vazquez got pinch-hitter Milton Bradley to pop out to shortstop.	Game notes	 Jeter and Posada both didn't start for New York, getting most of the day off for rest. ... Washington QB Jake Locker threw out the first pitch wearing a Mariners jersey. Last summer, Locker signed a contract with the Los Angeles Angels after being drafted in the 10th round. ... INF Chad Tracy reported to Triple-A Scranton for the Yankees on Saturday. Tracy was claimed off waivers after being designated by the Chicago Cubs.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

DETROIT -- The short-handed Minnesota Twins desperately needed to change things up before the All-Star break. They'd loss four straight games, including a pair to division-rival Detroit, and were missing two All-Stars to injury.	Carl Pavano made sure to alter the status quo.	He pitched well into the eighth inning Sunday, helping Minnesota win 6-3 and keep from falling further behind Detroit and the Chicago White Sox in the AL Central.	"I hope a lot of people watched Carl and saw how he handled things today," said manager Ron Gardenhire, who gave his Twins a pep talk before the game. "We've been in this situation before, and the key is cheering for each other and staying positive."	Pavano is 5-2 with a 2.81 ERA in eight career starts against the Tigers.	"He was very good today," said Detroit manager Jim Leyland. "We've always had trouble with him, and that didn't change today."	The Twins were missing Justin Morneau due to a concussion and catcher Joe Mauer, who would have gotten the day off from catching anyway but did not DH because of a sore shoulder.	The Tigers lost for only the third time in 20 home games since June 2.	"This was still a 7-2 homestand, which is very good," Leyland said. "We haven't set the world on fire in the first half of the season, but we've done pretty well. We just need to win more road games if we want to stay in this."	Pavano (10-6) improved to 5-0 in his last seven starts, allowing three runs on six hits in 7 2/3 innings, before the bullpen took over. Jon Rauch pitched a scoreless ninth for his 20th save in 24 tries.	"I felt good today, and I knew that if I set a good tone, the guys would get me some runs," Pavano said. "That's a tough lineup, though, and they got to me a little at the end."	Andy Oliver, originally scheduled to pitch in the Futures Game in Anaheim, dropped to 0-3 in four career starts. The rookie gave up four runs on five hits and four walks in 4 2/3 innings.	"I was getting ahead in the count, but then I was trying to get too cute, and an 0-2 count was turning into 3-2," said Oliver, who hadn't pitched above Double-A before being called up on June 25. "I'm not able to control a game here like I was able to do in Erie."	Oliver walked the first two batters of the game, and they both came around to score on RBI singles by Jim Thome and Jason Kubel.	The Twins loaded the bases in the third, but shortstop Ramon Santiago made a running catch of Thome's soft liner, then used a backhanded flip to start an inning-ending double play.	Oliver got into trouble again in the fifth with a walk, a hit batter and a wild pitch. He struck out Thome with runners on second and third, but Cuddyer hit a two-run double off reliever Eddie Bonine that made it 4-0.	Meanwhile, Pavano retired the first 13 hitters he faced before Brennan Boesch beat out an infield single with one out in the fifth. Two pitches later, Carlos Guillen grounded into an inning-ending double play.	Miguel Cabrera's RBI double made it 4-1 in the seventh and extended his career-best hitting streak to 19 games. Boesch added a run-scoring groundout later in the inning, but the Twins put the game away in the eighth.	Cuddyer started the inning with a single, bringing Brad Thomas in to replace Bonine. Kubel singled and Danny Valencia made it 5-2 with an RBI double. After a pop-out, Drew Butera's sacrifice fly restored the Twins' a four-run advantage.	"We were playing defensively all game," Leyland said. "Oliver was in trouble every inning, and the two times where we brought someone out of the bullpen to get a big out, we didn't get either one."	Game notes	 Over an hour after the game's conclusion, and well after he had left the stadium, Tigers starter Justin Verlander was named to the AL All-Star team as a replacement for a Sunday starter. "I absolutely want to go -- the All-Star Game is the All-Star Game, no matter how you get there," he said. ... Gardenhire said that Mauer will still take part in the All-Star game.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

TORONTO -- David Ortiz found his own way to beat the shadows that were playing havoc with hitters Sunday.	"I just close my eyes and swing," Ortiz said.	Ortiz and Darnell McDonald hit back-to-back home runs, Daisuke Matsuzaka won for the first time in more than a month and the Boston Red Sox beat the Toronto Blue Jays 3-2.	For the second time this homestand, there were mechanical problems with the retractable roof at Rogers Centre. One panel remained in place Sunday, leaving shadows over the infield. Both home plate and the mound were in shade for the first three innings but the mound was in full sun by the fourth, creating a difficult contrast for batters.	"It was a great, great day to pitch," Red Sox manager Terry Francona said. "With the shadow where it was, it was so hard to see. You see half the ball. I went out to make a change and it was so dark [at the plate] and so light [at the mound]."	McDonald said the shadows were "unbelievable."	"That was probably the worst game I've ever played in as far as dealing with the shadows," McDonald said.	The entire roof was forced to remain closed during last Wednesday's game against Minnesota.	Aaron Hill connected for Blue Jays, who lead the major leagues with 136 homers, 18 more than Boston, but Toronto's streak of multihomer games was snapped at seven, one shy of the club record.	Matsuzaka (6-3) allowed two runs and six hits in six-plus innings. He walked none and struck out five to win for the first time since June 7 at Cleveland.	"Dice-K was outstanding," catcher Kevin Cash said. "With or without shadows, he had great stuff today."	Daniel Bard worked two innings and Jonathan Papelbon closed it out in the ninth for his 20th save.	Boston lost All-Star third baseman Adrian Beltre in the sixth with a strained left hamstring. Bill Hall moved from second to third and Eric Patterson replaced Beltre in the lineup.	Beltre, who is on the American League roster for Tuesday's All-Star Game, said he'd be cautious about playing in Anaheim.	If I don't feel good I won't play," Beltre said. "I don't want to screw up my season for a couple of at-bats in an exhibition game."	Blue Jays right-hander Jesse Litsch (0-4) was perfect through the first three innings before issuing a two-out walk to Ortiz in the fourth. Kevin Youkilis followed with a fly out to right.	Marco Scutaro ended Litsch's no-hit bid in the sixth with a two-out double to right-center. Litsch's shutout bid ended when McDonald followed with a two-run drive to left, his sixth.	"When he first got here I think he was really trying to show he belonged in the big leagues," Francona said. "Now he knows he belongs, he knows he's valuable on our team. He's kind of taken it and run with it. He's been tremendous."	Ortiz followed that with a solo blast into the second deck in right, his 18th. It was the fourth time this season the Red Sox have hit back-to-back homers and the second time this series. Youkilis and Beltre did it in Friday's 14-3 win.	Litsch came in 4-1 in six career starts against Boston, including 3-0 in three home starts. The right-hander remains winless in six starts since coming off the disabled list June 9. He allowed three runs and four hits in seven innings, walked one and struck out five.	Toronto chased Matsuzaka in the seventh when Adam Lind led off with a single and Hill followed with a two-run homer to left, his 12th.	Game notes	 Boston RHP Josh Beckett (sore back) started at Triple-A Pawtucket Sunday, throwing 68 pitches in four innings. He allowed one run and two hits, walked none and struck out four. ... Red Sox OF Mike Cameron, who was hit on the right wrist by a pitch Saturday, did not start. ... LHP Ricky Romero, RHP Brandon Morrow and RHP Shaun Marcum will start Toronto's first three games following the All-Star break, manager Cito Gaston said.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

NEW YORK -- A gem by Johan Santana and the mere sight of Carlos Beltran gave the New York Mets two reasons Sunday to get excited about the second half.	Santana saved the Mets from a sweep with another spotless outing and rookie Ike Davis hit his latest titanic home run in New York's 3-0 victory over the Atlanta Braves.	The Mets head into the All-Star break four games behind first-place Atlanta in the NL East, with their star center fielder set to come off the disabled list and make his season debut Thursday night in San Francisco.	"It was a big game for us. There was a lot of life on the bench for us that was not there yesterday. There was a nice spirit about the team. Maybe it had something to do with Carlos Beltran walking through the locker room," manager Jerry Manuel said. "It almost feels like you got two players back, Johan and Carlos."	Alex Cora and pinch-hitter Josh Thole delivered two-out RBI singles, and Angel Pagan had three of New York's 13 hits. The Mets also got flawless relief work from Bobby Parnell and Francisco Rodriguez in their major league-best 13th shutout.	Fantastic at Citi Field for most of the first half, New York averted a three-game sweep but finished 2-4 on a disappointing homestand against a pair of division leaders.	"We didn't play very well on this homestand in general," David Wright said. "Really this road trip after the break I think is a great test for us, a big challenge."	The Braves, who had won four straight, still own the league's best record at 52-36.	"It's nice to go into halftime being in first place," manager Bobby Cox said. "I feel really good about that and I'm proud of the club."	After scoring six runs in the previous four games, New York didn't manage much on offense this time, either. Playing without ailing shortstop Jose Reyes and slumping slugger Jason Bay, the Mets stranded 11 runners and grounded into two double plays.	Still, Santana (7-5) and the bullpen made a few clutch hits stand up.	"We didn't want to go into the break the way we played the last few days," Manuel said.	Coming off a three-hit shutout of Cincinnati on Tuesday, when he hit his first major league home run, Santana was brilliant again. He allowed five hits and three walks in seven comfortable innings, striking out five.	Following a two-start skid, the two-time Cy Young Award winner has yielded one run and 14 hits in his past three outings, covering 23 innings.	"I feel much better," Santana said. "Hopefully, this second half will be a strong one."	Rookie shortstop Ruben Tejada, subbing for Reyes, made a diving play to end the seventh with a runner on.	Parnell came on to face the middle of Atlanta's lineup in the eighth and set down Chipper Jones, Troy Glaus and All-Star Brian McCann in order. Rodriguez pitched a perfect ninth for his 21st save in 25 tries.	Pagan tripled to right-center with two outs in the third and scored on Cora's single off Derek Lowe (9-8).	Davis drove a 2-0 pitch to center field leading off the sixth and it soared about 430 feet to the back of the black batter's eye behind the home run apple.	"You don't want to walk the guy and I just threw it down the middle," Lowe said. "I guess you'd say he got a pretty good swing on it."	It was Davis' 11th home run -- and several have carried to rarely reached spots in cavernous Citi Field.	"It was definitely one of my favorites," said Davis, who also won the team's World Cup pool when Spain edged the Netherlands 1-0 for the title. "That's as good as I can hit the ball. You've got to hit 'em to get it out of here."	Lowe was lifted after 5 1/3 innings. He gave up two runs and eight hits, losing his third straight start.	"This is when the fun starts," said Lowe, outpitched by Roy Halladay and Santana in his past two outings. "The first three months you work to get yourself in position to where the last 2 1/2 months really matter. I think we've done that."	Jesus Feliciano singled off Takashi Saito to start the eighth and scored on a single by Thole, who is 9 for 17 (.529) since getting called up from the minors -- including 4 for 5 with three RBIs as a pinch hitter.	Game notes	 Bay is 0 for 15 against Lowe and was rested -- on his bobblehead day. Manuel said he thought the slugger has been tired for a while and he wanted him to "exhale" and "start fresh" on the West Coast after the break. Chris Carter started in LF and went 2 for 3 before getting pulled for a pinch runner. ... Mets LHP Oliver Perez (knee) made his third rehab start, tossing 100 pitches over five innings for Triple-A Buffalo. He allowed an unearned run and five walks, with three strikeouts and two wild pitches. ... After the game, Feliciano was optioned to Buffalo to make roster room for Beltran. ... New York went 7 for 51 (.137) with runners in scoring position on the homestand. ... Matt Diaz had two hits and is 14 for 25 (.560) against Santana.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

WASHINGTON -- San Francisco manager Bruce Bochy has something to ponder during the All-Star break: how to keep first baseman Travis Ishikawa in the Giants' lineup.	Ishikawa drove in three runs, rookie Madison Bumgarner took a shutout into the seventh inning and the San Francisco Giants beat the Washington Nationals 6-2 on Sunday.	Relegated to a pinch-hitting role for much of the season's first half, Ishikawa has flourished since the Giants moved rookie Buster Posey behind the plate full time, opening an opportunity at first base. He wasn't a slouch as a pinch hitter, either, leading the majors with a .476 average (10 for 21).	"The first few months of this season, I knew I wasn't going to start," Ishikawa said. "I just tried to stay mentally focused on what the job was at hand: I was going to come off the bench to hit or play defense. Just getting the opportunity on this road trip, at first kind of feeling like it was a spot start to give some guys a day off, I went in there with no expectations, no pressure."	On the road trip, Ishikawa was 11 for 29 (.379) with a homer and 10 RBIs.	"He's really taken advantage of the opportunity here," Bochy said. "I knew as soon as Buster started catching, we'd put [Ishikawa] in there and get a left-handed bat in there. He's got some huge hits for us, great job at first base and he's going to get some playing time."	Posey had two RBIs for the Giants, who finished their season-high 11-game road trip 7-4. San Francisco has won seven of nine overall.	Bumgarner (2-2) allowed a run and seven hits in six-plus innings, walked none and struck out six to win his second consecutive start.	"I feel like confidence is a big thing, and if you have a little bit of success you get more confidence," Bumgarner said. "I'm pretty happy with these last two starts."	The Nationals finished the first half by losing three of four. They are 11 games under .500, matching a season low.	"It should leave a sour taste -- and it is," Nationals manager Jim Riggleman said	Still, Washington's 39-50 record is considerably better than the 26-61 mark the Nationals sported at last year's All-Star break.	"There's some progress. ... We want to get to the point where we're not satisfied with progress," Riggleman said. "We want to make the next step."	Washington's Livan Hernandez (6-5) struggled through five innings, yielding five runs and five hits. He walked two and struck out four.	"I don't feel too good," Hernandez said. "My body don't respond perfect. It's no excuse. ... I tried to keep the ball down and it didn't happen. A lot of base hits."	Brian Wilson got the final four outs for his 23rd save in 25 tries.	The Giants took a 2-0 lead in the first when Hernandez loaded the bases on an infield single by Aaron Rowand and one-out walks to Aubrey Huff and Posey before Ishikawa knocked a two-run single to right.	In the third, Posey tripled home two runs, then scored on Ishikawa's sacrifice fly for a 5-0 lead.	Freddy Sanchez and Huff singled before Posey was credited with a triple when Nyjer Morgan misplayed his fly ball off the center-field wall. Ishikawa then flied out to center, scoring Posey.	Bumgarner worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the sixth. He exited after allowing Ian Desmond's leadoff single in the seventh and San Francisco needed three relievers to get out of the inning.	Chris Ray walked pinch-hitter Willie Harris and Cristian Guzman hit a one-out RBI single to center. Ray walked Ryan Zimmerman to load the bases and was replaced by Jeremy Affeldt. Adam Dunn singled off Affeldt's left leg, driving in a run, and Sergio Romo came in. Romo fanned Josh Willingham on three pitches and got Rodriguez to fly deep to center.	Juan Uribe added an RBI single off Drew Storen in the seventh for a 6-2 Giants lead.	Game notes	 Before the game, a moment of silence was held to honor longtime Yankees public address Bob Sheppard, who died Sunday at 99. Nationals reliever Tyler Clippard, who broke in with the Yankees in 2007, said, "That voice is what being a Yankee was all about." ... A baserunning mistake by Dunn saved Giants CF Rowand from an error in the sixth. With runners on first and second, Rodriguez singled up the middle and a charging Rowand overran the ball. However, Dunn held up at third base, instead of scoring on the miscue, and Willingham, en route to third, had to quickly retreat to second. ... Dunn had three hits for his club-leading 26th multihilt game. ... Posey is 20 for 40 with 15 RBIs in his last 11 games.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PHILADELPHIA -- The Philadelphia Phillies just keep finding ways to win.	Cole Hamels tossed six-hit ball into the eighth inning, Jimmy Rollins drove in the only run and the Phillies completed a four-game sweep of the NL Central-leading Cincinnati Reds with a 1-0 victory Sunday.	What a way to sweep.	The Phillies started the series with three game-ending wins in extra innings for the first time in team history, and finished it with consecutive 1-0 victories for the first time since April 18-19, 1913, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.	With their offense in a funk, the pitching staff tossed 21 straight scoreless innings.	Oh, and Philadelphia scored six runs in the ninth to stun the Reds on Friday.	"It was more than expected," Philadelphia right fielder Jayson Werth said. "It was a lot like the Phillies teams of the last couple of years."	The two-time defending NL champions enter the All-Star break 4 1/2 games back of NL East-leading Atlanta -- and ready to make a second-half charge.	"I'd like to be in first place," manager Charlie Manuel said. "I don't see why anybody would say they like trailing. It doesn't mean we won't catch somebody and end up winning it."	Hamels (7-7) struck out three, walked three and didn't allow a run for the first time in 18 starts this season. J.C. Romero fanned the only batter he faced in the ninth, and Brad Lidge got the final two outs for his sixth save.	Lidge has struggled since his 41-for-41 save season in 2008, when the Phillies won the World Series. He was booed when he entered the game but claimed he was so locked in, he didn't hear the traditional Philly sound.	"If I'm not mistaken, I heard them all cheering there at the end," Manuel said. "I might not be too smart but my ears are still good."	The fans had plenty to cheer the rest of the series.	Rollins won Saturday's game with an 11th-inning single after Reds starter Travis Wood took a perfect game into the ninth. The Phillies scored six times in the ninth to tie the game Friday night and won on Ryan Howard's two-run homer in the 10th. Brian Schneider hit a game-ending homer in the 12th in the series-opener Thursday night.	They only needed Hamels and nine innings to send the Reds stumbling into the All-Star break.	The left-hander tossed the best game of his season to win for the first time since June 13, after going 1-5 over his last eight starts. Hamels worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the fourth and was never in serious trouble after that.	"It's nice to get out of that inning because that's a momentum changer," Hamels said.	He was yanked after surrendering a two-out double to All-Star Joey Votto in the eighth, and Hamels walked off to a standing ovation from the 84th straight sellout at Citizens Bank Park.	Jose Contreras walked Scott Rolen, then retired Jonny Gomes on a grounder to end the rally.	Matt Maloney (0-2) allowed a run and four hits in six innings, but the Reds remain stuck on 49 wins. They were trying to win 50 before the All-Star break for the first time since 1994.	"We've been knocking on 50 for a long time here," manager Dusty Baker said. "Going on three days. It seems like a month."	Instead, they were swept in a four-game series in Philly for the first time since 1975.	"We'll try and erase these four games here and get back on track," Gomes said. "It's been a tough stretch on the road."	The Phillies went 0 for 2 on replays after two doubles were not changed into home runs.	Carlos Ruiz led off the third inning with a ground-rule double when a fan reached over the fence and touched the ball. Phillies manager Charlie Manuel came out to argue and the play went under a brief review. The double stood and Ruiz scored on Rollins' single.	Jayson Werth hit a drive to deep center in the fourth that was caught by a fan, and Manuel sauntered out to protest that the ball had cleared the wall. Replays clearly showed the fan leaned over the rail and Werth had a double.	Game notes	 Howard was hit by a pitch twice. ... Phillies 3B Placido Polanco (elbow) will head to Clearwater, Fla., on Tuesday and begin a minor league rehab assignment by the end of the week. ... Manuel, his coaching staff and Howard, Chase Utley and Roy Halladay were presented with their All-Star game jerseys during a pregame send off. ... The Phillies were the first team to have three straight game-ending wins in extra innings against the same team in extra innings since Seattle vs. Texas in 2002.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- The Tampa Bay Rays ended the first half of the season on a roll.	Jason Bartlett hit a game-ending single over a drawn-in outfield in the 10th inning, giving the Rays a 6-5 win over the Cleveland Indians on Sunday.	"It's a nice way to walk off into the All-Star break," Tampa Bay manager Joe Maddon said.	Ben Zobrist opened the 10th with a single off Kerry Wood (1-4) and later was forced out at second on Carl Crawford's grounder. After Crawford stole second, Evan Longoria was intentionally walked. Bartlett then won it with a long single to right center on an 1-2 pitch.	"He's a strikeout pitcher, so I was just trying to battle, put the bat on the ball," Bartlett said.	Crawford homered for the Rays, who are 9-2 in July after going 11-14 during June. Andy Sonnanstine (2-0) pitched a perfect 10th.	Cleveland got two RBIs from Austin Kearns. The Indians, who walked 10 batters Sunday, lost three of four in the series and are 17-32 on the road this season.	"We battled really hard against this good ballclub," Indians manager Manny Acta said. "You can't be expecting to walk 10 people and stay in the game. You have to work some magic just to not get buried."	Tampa Bay's Jeff Niemann left after five innings with back stiffness, but expects to make his next scheduled start Saturday at the New York Yankees. The right-hander, who threw just 70 pitches, gave up three runs and six hits.	"A little bit of tightness," Niemann said. "It really wasn't anything big and it shouldn't affect the second half."	The Rays loaded the bases with no outs in the ninth against Hector Ambriz, but failed to score when B.J. Upton flew out to short center, Reid Brignac struck out and Sean Rodriguez hit a grounder.	"A lot of good things took place," Cleveland starter Justin Masterson said. "Hector Ambriz is out there getting out of that jam. That's pretty cool. We came close."	Masterson allowed five runs and eight hits in five innings.	Crawford hit a two-run homer off Masterson and Upton had a sacrifice fly to put the Rays ahead 5-3 in the fifth. Crawford hit a pair of two-run shots in Thursday's 5-2 win over the Indians.	Cleveland tied it at 5 during the sixth when Trevor Crowe had a run-scoring single and another run scored when Anderson Hernandez hit into a double play.	Kearns drove in two runs with a single and Matt LaPorta hit an RBI double as the Indians went up 3-0 in the first.	The Rays got one run back in the bottom of the first when Crawford scored from third on a botched rundown after Carlos Pena hit a grounder back to Masterson, who then threw the ball to third base. Andy Marte chased Crawford toward the plate before being charged with an error for a bad throw to catcher Chris Gimenez.	"Actually, I think had that ball not been caught by Masterson, it would have been a routine double play up the middle," Maddon said. "He makes a wonderful play and we get a run out of it, so I guess it was meant to be."	Brignac's RBI single got the Rays to 3-2 in the fourth.	Game notes	 Crawford said his left shoulder is sore and was the DH for the second consecutive game. ... Acta said OF Shin-Soo Choo, who has been on the disabled list since July 3 with a sprained right thumb, could return by the end of the month. ... Indians DH Travis Hafner (left upper back stiffness) underwent treatment and was available in an emergency situation. ... Cleveland LHP Aaron Laffey said he is fine although his velocity was down in Saturday's start. Acta plans to monitor the matter.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

CHICAGO -- White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen was stunned when he saw the American League Central standings.	Carlos Quentin hit a grand slam and a solo homer, and the Chicago White Sox surged into first place in the AL Central with a 15-5 win over the Kansas City Royals on Sunday.	Andruw Jones hit his 400th career homer during a seven-run, four homer third inning for Chicago, which moved atop the division after trailing the Twins by 9 1/2 games on June 8.	"A shock. To be honest with you, I think it is a shock just because the way the team was playing, all the negative stuff outside the clubhouse How many games we got to put up to be over .500. How many games we were out of first place. It's a shock how quick we did it," Guillen said. "I know we are going to compete this year and hopefully we stay the same way we are right now. We put ourselves in a pretty nice spot and see what happens the rest of the summer."	The White Sox overcame a first half of reported disputes between Guillen and general manager Ken Williams, an inept offense and a struggling rotation for the first two months of the season.	During the seven-game homestand, Quentin was 7 for 13 with six home runs and 11 RBIs. Quentin, who had two home runs in the win on Saturday, had three multihomer games during the homestand. He missed three games because a sore left knee.	"Sometimes you hit the ball, it goes out of the yard. Sometimes someone catches the ball. Baseball is a very fragile game, it changes in a second and it's always to be respected," Quentin said. "I'm fortunate to get some good pitches to hit and take some good swings and help the team win. I stay with an approach every time and trust it and good things have happened."	Alex Rios and Dayan Viciedo also homered for the White Sox (49-38), who have won eight straight and 25 of 30. Chicago moved a half-game ahead of Detroit for first.	On June 9, Williams vowed to make changes.	A.J. Pierzynski also didn't believe getting to the top of the division by the end of the first half was possible.	"No. We said if we could just get close by the end of June, have it down to five or six games, then we'd have a chance," Pierzynski said. "To be in the position we're in is pretty unbelievable."	After a four-game sweep over the Los Angeles Angels, the White Sox capped the homestand off with a three-game sweep of the Royals.	Royals starter Anthony Lerew got two outs in the third inning then was tagged for four home runs. After missing on two big swings, Rios connected for his 15th homer on an 0-2 pitch. Then Quentin followed on a 3-1 pitch to give the White Sox a 4-1 lead. Mark Kotsay continued the third inning with a single and Pierzynski walked, then Jones hit his milestone home run into the left-field bullpen. Viciedo chased Lerew with a longball deep to left.	The four home runs in the inning tied a franchise record for the sixth time. The White Sox last hit four home runs in an inning Aug. 14, 2008, against the Royals.	"I'm surprised they had enough fireworks left," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "It's just one of those days. We left some balls up and they hammered them."	In the sixth inning, Quentin tagged reliever Victor Marte for a grand slam. It was his 19th homer of the season. Quentin received a curtain call from the 29,040 fans.	Lerew started in place of Zack Greinke, who was scratched from the start for precautionary reasons because of a sore right shoulder. Greinke is expected to start the first game back from the All-Star break on July 16 against Oakland.	Lerew (1-3) allowed eight runs on nine hits in 2 2/3 innings.	Jones passed Al Kaline and Andres Galarraga for 46th place on the all-time home run list.	Before the game, Chicago called up right-hander Daniel Hudson from Triple-A Charlotte to start in place of Jake Peavy, who is scheduled for season-ending surgery on Wednesday.	Hudson didn't last long enough to earn the victory.	He gave up a two-run homer to Jose Guillen in the fourth inning. In the fifth, he allowed two runs on three hits, including an RBI single to Scott Podsednik that ended his day.	Hudson allowed five runs on six hits in four-plus innings.	Tony Pena (3-1) pitched three-hit ball for three innings.	Jose Guillen homered for the Royals, who have been swept three times on the season.	Game notes	 White Sox 1B Paul Konerko had the day off. ... The Royals allowed a season high for runs and hits (18). ... The White Sox are a season-high 11 games over .500 and are a major league best 20-9 in day games.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

HOUSTON -- After a sweep in Colorado, the St. Louis Cardinals were looking for a positive finish to the first half of the season.	They found it in Houston, where Matt Holliday hit a three-run homer in a 4-2 win over the Astros on Sunday that gave them a series win over their NL Central rival.	The Cardinals trailed 2-0 before Holliday's shot to left field in the fourth inning. It was his 16th home run of the season.	"We were playing for our lives," Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said of his team, which ended the first half in second place behind Cincinnati. "That describes what we did. We're alive and kicking. Houston has played us pretty tough. They have a winning record against us. To win the series, it's a really good win."	Blake Hawksworth (3-5) yielded seven hits and two runs in 5 1/3 innings to get the win in his fifth major league start. Closer Ryan Franklin pitched a scoreless ninth for his 16th save in 17 opportunities.	"Location wasn't its best," Hawksworth said. "First two innings were tough on the pitch count, too. Glad we got the win going into the break. That's the most important thing, but I have to get better."	Houston starter Wandy Rodriguez's winning streak was snapped at three after he allowed four hits and three runs with six strikeouts.	"That one pitch was a good pitch inside and he hit the ball for a home run," Rodriguez said of Holliday's shot. "It wasn't a mistake."	Colby Rasmus, who didn't start for the second consecutive game because of a tight right hamstring, drove in a run with a two-out, pinch-hit single in the eighth inning that made it 4-2. He was replaced by a pinch runner after the hit.	The Astros' Michael Bourn walked in the first inning before a single by Jeff Keppinger, and Bourn scored on a single by Carlos Lee with one out. Keppinger scored on a single by Hunter Pence to make it 2-0.	Rodriguez (6-11) retired the first 10 batters he faced before rookie Jon Jay extended his hitting streak to 11 games on a single with one out in the fourth inning. A single by Albert Pujols set up Holliday's fifth home run in the last six games and gave St. Louis a 3-2 lead.	"This win was well-deserved, and we needed it," La Russa said. "We had a big swing from Matt. At that point, before that thing started, we weren't doing anything against Rodriguez."	Yadier Molina doubled with two outs before Houston intentionally walked Tyler Greene, but Rodriguez limited the damage when Hawksworth grounded out.	The Astros had 10 hits, but couldn't put anything together after the first inning on a day when they learned hitting coach Sean Berry had been let go to make room for former star Jeff Bagwell to take the position. Bagwell wasn't in uniform Sunday and begins work on Thursday in Pittsburgh before the start of Friday's series with the Pirates.	A pair of singles in the seventh inning put Keppinger in scoring position, but Kyle McClellan retired Pedro Feliz to end the inning. McClellan struck out one in 1 2/3 innings.	Game notes	 La Russa said after the game that there is "no doubt" Rasmus will return to the starting lineup after the All-Star break. ... The Cardinals hoped OF Ryan Ludwick could come off the DL after the break, but La Russa said Sunday that he isn't sure if that will happen. Ludwick has been out with a left calf strain since June 26. ... Houston RHP Brian Moehler, who left Wednesday's game with a strained right groin, should be available after the break.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

MILWAUKEE -- Corey Hart's game-winning home run capped a rocky first half of the season for the Brewers' All-Star outfielder, one that started ugly and ended sensationally.	Hart hit a two-run shot in the ninth inning to give Milwaukee a dramatic 6-5 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Sunday. It was Hart's 21st of the season and second game winner.	Hart's season did not start well. He beat the Brewers in salary arbitration, then was tabbed as a platoon player sharing time in right field with the newly acquired Jim Edmonds. The team even left Hart's name off the All-Star ballot.	Injuries eventually gave him a chance to play every day, and a move to second in the batting order helped erase some of the bitterness. Now, he's headed to the All-Star game as a starter in the outfield, taking the place of Atlanta's Jason Heyward, who is out with an injury.	"I was trying not to get released the first month of the year," Hart said. "It's a pretty good feeling to be able to come back like this."	Hart said that he was angry with the way the season started.	"I felt like I had a chip on my shoulder and I wanted to prove them wrong," he said. "I talked to [hitting coach] Dale [Sveum] quite a bit going through this. They were going to help me get back to showing the guys I should be out there again. I figured if I worked hard enough I'd work my way back in the lineup."	Hart also said that he understood why he fell from favor.	"I put myself in that spot," he said. "You always want to feel like your team has your back, but at the same time if you don't play well, I guess they only give you a certain leeway. I guess I had gotten to the point where they felt I shouldn't be a starter. I didn't cry about it or cry about playing time. I just fought to prove them wrong and I feel like I have."	Hart had struck out twice, flied out and hit into a double play Sunday before his heroics in the ninth inning.	The Brewers trailed 5-4 when Edmonds led off with a ground-rule double. Rickie Weeks flied out before Hart belted a 2-0 pitch from Octavio Dotel (2-2) over the wall in left for his second game-ending home run of the season.	Dotel had his streak of seven straight saves snapped Friday night when he allowed one run in the ninth as the Brewers took the first game of the series.	Lastings Milledge came to the defense of the Pirates bullpen, which has converted 20 of 30 save opportunities.	"Nobody can question what the bullpen's been doing," he said. "They've been unstoppable out there the whole year. We haven't given them too much to work with throughout the year."	John Axford (5-1) allowed a run in the ninth but picked up the win for Milwaukee, which swept the three-game series and handed Pittsburgh its sixth straight loss. The Brewers had lost five straight before the series, and improved to 8-3 against the Pirates this season.	Pittsburgh was also swept by Houston and hasn't won since beating Philadelphia last Sunday.	The Pirates had taken the lead in their half of the ninth inning when Ronny Cedeno bunted down the first-base line and slid past Prince Fielder, who fielded the ball and tried to tag him before reaching first base. Delwyn Young punched a single through the gap and Andrew McCutchen hit his second sacrifice fly, allowing Cedeno to easily beat Hart's throw to the plate.	Pittsburgh never trailed until the game-ending homer by Hart.	Milledge hit a solo home run for Pittsburgh, and starting pitcher Brad Lincoln and McCutchen each drove in runs to make it 3-0 in the second inning.	Milwaukee scored in the third on Weeks' sacrifice fly, and managed to tie the game in the fourth when Ryan Braun -- the only Brewers player in franchise history to start three straight All-Star games -- hit a solo shot and George Kottaras added another two outs later.	The home runs continued in the sixth when Pedro Alvarez went deep for Pittsburgh, the major league-leading 21st allowed by Milwaukee starter Randy Wolf.	The Brewers still trailed in the eighth when Braun singled up the middle, and Carlos Gomez -- hitting just .038 with runners in scoring position and two outs -- lined an 0-2 pitch into right that tied the game again.	Braun snapped a 1-for-21 stretch by driving in the game-winner in the 10th inning Friday night. He also hit his first home run since June 28 on Saturday night.	Game notes	 Fielder played in his 274th consecutive game, the longest active streak in the majors, and tied the franchise record set by Hall of Famer Robin Yount (1987-89). ... Asked before the game about his team's first half, Brewers manager Ken Macha said, "There are pieces in place. We've seen brilliance from all areas, and we've seen bad play from all areas."	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- Baltimore Orioles rookie Jake Arrieta grew up going to games at Rangers Ballpark. This time, he was on the mound helping the majors' worst team get a win.	Arrieta pitched into the seventh inning, Corey Patterson had another big hit against Texas and the Orioles won 4-1 Sunday to go into the All-Star break with their first four-game road sweep since 1995.	"To have all my friends and family here, it feels great. To sweep one of the best teams in the league in Arlington, that's huge for our team's confidence," said Arrieta, who pitched at nearby Plano East High and then TCU. "It's a great way to end the first half."	The Orioles (29-59) hadn't won any of their 14 road series this season before Texas.	"These guys probably feel like they don't want to go on the break," said Juan Samuel, who became the Orioles' interim manager when Dave Trembley was fired June 4. "But we've gone through a lot."	Despite their 3-7 homestand, the Rangers (50-38) still have a 4 1/2-game division lead. The Los Angeles Angels have also been struggling, losing 5-2 at Oakland on Sunday to end a 1-6 trip.	"We're in first place. There's no need for us to be sad," manager Ron Washington said. "We just have to come out of the break and hold on to it."	The Rangers led 1-0 after All-Star second baseman Ian Kinsler hit a two-out homer in the first. Baltimore responded with three doubles in the second -- Adam Jones had a leadoff double, Julio Lugo had an RBI double and Patterson hit a two-run double off C.J. Wilson (7-5) that snapped a 1-all tie.	Miguel Tejada, who walked three times against Wilson, homered in the ninth.	Arrieta (3-2), the 24-year-old right-hander who had more than 100 family and friends in the stands for his seventh major league start, held Texas to six hits over 6 1/3 innings.	"I only made one or two mistakes. Kinsler was able to take advantage on a fastball that ran away," Arrieta said. "There was adrenaline at the start of the game, but I felt comfortable."	Arrieta hadn't won since his first two starts, including his June 10 debut at the New York Yankees. The Orioles bullpen blew the 3-1 lead he had after 6 1/3 innings in his previous start Tuesday at Detroit, but not against the Rangers.	Will Ohman allowed the only two batters he faced to reach, but Jason Berken pitched 1 2/3 scoreless innings before Alfredo Simon worked around two singles in the ninth for his 13th save.	After Baltimore won 7-6 in 10 innings Friday night, when Patterson hit a tying, two-out, two-strike slam in the ninth, the Rangers didn't have a hit until the seventh inning Saturday, when newly acquired left-hander Cliff Lee made his Texas debut with a complete-game loss.	Kinsler gave the Rangers a quick lead in the series finale, but that was the only of their nine hits that went for extra bases.	Chris Davis, the first baseman recalled when Justin Smoak was sent to Seattle as part of the Lee deal, had three hits and a walk for Texas.	Wilson had won his last four home starts, but threw only 60 of his 111 pitches for strikes during 4 2/3 innings. The left-hander struck out five -- including all three batters he faced in the third -- walked five and threw three wild pitches. The only hits he allowed were the three doubles in the second.	"I felt like I did a good job of preventing guys from getting hits, but I couldn't keep guys off base," Wilson said. "I'm a better pitcher than the result I put up today and I'm frustrated about that discrepancy."	While Kinsler had his fourth homer of the season, he had a tough day defensively.	He was charged with an error in the fifth when he made a nice backhanded stop up the middle on a grounder by Ty Wigginton, Baltimore's All-Star, then dropped the ball taking it out of his glove. In the eighth, Kinsler couldn't come up with the ball on a similar play and slammed his hand on the ground. Craig Tatum was credited with a single, then had his first career stolen base when he was called safe even though it appeared he slid right into Kinsler's swipe tag.	"We hit a little rough spot. They're playing good and we couldn't really get anything going offensively," Kinsler said. "We've got three days to think about it."	Game notes	 The last four-game road sweep by Baltimore came against the Chicago White Sox in June 1995. ... Ohman made his 45th appearance this season without a decision. The previous Orioles record for appearances without a decision to start the season was Mike Flanagan's 42 in 1992. ... The first pitch was thrown by King Oyo, who at age 18 is one of the youngest reigning monarchs in the world, over a kingdom in Uganda. It was his first MLB game.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DENVER -- Colorado reliever Matt Belisle was pitching well enough. His defense cost him, though.	Belisle's bases-loaded throwing error led to two unearned runs in the eighth inning for the Padres, Everth Cabrera hit his first homer of the season in the ninth and San Diego beat the Colorado Rockies 9-7 Sunday to avert a series sweep.	"I take full responsibility for this loss," Belisle said. "I 'zoomed' it, there's just no other way to say it. I felt calm and collected and made the pitches and executed them, but I failed at the defensive play. But that seventh game of the World Series, I want to be there doing it again and I'm confident I'll make that play."	Scott Hairston matched a career high with four hits in helping the NL West-leading Padres gain a two-game cushion over second-place Colorado heading into the All-Star break. The Rockies had their season-high six-game winning streak snapped.	Heath Bell, coming on in the eighth after reliever Mike Adams left with an oblique strain, got the five outs for his 24th save in 27 chances, giving up an RBI single to Carlos Gonzalez.	"This was big, to end the half with a win," said Hairston. "We battled every game and every night and even those we lost the previous two nights, we put ourselves in position to win. They are an extremely hot team and have been swinging the bats well. But we never get down and we didn't get down today."	Trailing 6-3 in the seventh, the Padres pulled to within a run on Chase Headley's two-run double off Randy Flores and moved back in front in the eighth when reliever Belisle's throwing error opened the door to the go-ahead runs.	Jerry Hairston Jr., who had three hits, and Aaron Cunningham each singled off Belisle (4-4) and Adrian Gonzalez was walked intentionally, bringing Nick Hundley to the plate.	Belisle induced a comebacker, fielded it cleanly but spun around and sidearmed the throw wildly past catcher Miguel Olivo. Two runners scored to put San Diego on top by a run.	"I knew I was going to throw home the whole time, but the way I spun around -- Olivo was a blur -- and I just rushed it," said Belisle, who conceded he had replayed the episode so much in his head that he had been left with a pounding headache.	Bell said it was important to put a dent in Colorado's recent run of success.	"The Rockies are all about momentum," Bell said. "When they have momentum, it's really hard to stop them. So any chance we can push them back a game or two, it is huge for us."	Despite the loss, the Rockies, who were six games behind the Padres a week ago, closed the first half strongly, going 8-2 on their just concluded homestand and winning 16 of the past 23 games.	"It was tough to lose but you try to look at the positives," said Colorado third baseman Ian Stewart. "We had a great homestand and we ended the first half in good position. Hopefully, we continue to play well in the second half."	Colorado broke a 3-all deadlock with a three-run sixth inning off Clayton Richard, who went 5 2/3 innings and gave up a season-high six runs. Richard walked Carlos Gonzalez, who advanced to second on a fly ball before Olivo singled to put the Rockies in front.	With two outs, Richard hit Stewart with a pitch and Clint Barmes blooped a run-scoring single to right, chasing Richard and bringing on reliever Luke Gregerson (3-5). Jhoulys Chacin greeted Gregerson with an RBI single to center. It was the first career RBI and just the second hit in 23 at-bats for Chacin, who pitched 1 1/3 innings in relief of starter Jeff Francis.	Down 3-0, the Rockies pulled to within a run in the fourth inning. Dexter Fowler became the Rockies' first baserunner of the game when he drew a leadoff walk and Jonathan Hererra followed with a run-scoring double. Carlos Gonzalez then singled to score Herrera.	They evened the score an inning later when Barmes drew a one-out walk and Brad Hawpe, who was hitting for Francis, doubled to the center field wall.	San Diego took advantage of a shaky first inning by Francis to score its first run. Francis hit Cunningham with a pitch and issued two walks around Scott Hairston's RBI single. Cunningham's RBI double in the second and Jerry Hairston Jr.'s run-scoring single in the fourth put San Diego up 3-0.	Game notes	 Cunningham's second-inning double also extended his career-high hitting streak to 10 games. ... Herrera's triple in the fourth gave him an 11-game hitting streak. ... The only other time Scott Hairston had four hits was July 26, 2004 against Houston	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- Trevor Cahill spent the past week peppering his Oakland teammate Andrew Bailey with questions about the All-Star game, imploring the closer to find a way onto the team even if it meant giving up his own spot in return.	In a roundabout way, that's exactly what happened.	Cahill scattered five hits over seven innings while Bailey pitched a scoreless ninth for his 18th save, and the A's beat the Los Angeles Angels 5-2 on Sunday.	Cahill (9-3) was replaced on the All-Star roster by Angels starter Jered Weaver, who lost for only the second time in his last six starts. Since he also pitched Sunday, Weaver was taken off the roster and replaced by Bailey, the reigning AL Rookie of the Year who will make his second straight trip to the All-Star Game.	"We live together and for the past week he's been like, 'You gotta make the team, you gotta make the team,' " Bailey said. "He's excited about it and I'm excited to go with him. To be able to hang out with him and share that experience with him is going to be cool."	Even though Cahill won't pitch in Tuesday's game, he'll attend the festivities in Anaheim coming off one of his most impressive outings of the season. The Oakland right-hander allowed an unearned run in the fifth after shortstop Cliff Pennington's throwing error, but was otherwise solid after getting shelled by the Yankees on July 6.	"After the last game I put a little more pressure on myself and I wanted to end the first half on a positive note, especially going to the All-Star Game," Cahill said.	Cahill scattered five hits over seven innings and worked out of a bases-loaded, no-out jam in the sixth without allowing a run to earn the win.	Jack Cust homered for the second time in three games, Adam Rosales added a two-run single and Kurt Suzuki went 3 for 3 to provide the run support.	Bobby Abreu homered for the second straight day for the Angels, who ended a dismal road trip 1-6. It's the first time since 2006 that Los Angeles entered the break outside of first place in the AL West. They remained 4 1/2 games behind the Texas Rangers.	"The last 10 games have not been good," manager Mike Scioscia said. "We have guys who have underperformed and we need them to do what they are capable of doing."	Cahill saved his best for the sixth, after Abreu's leadoff double, a walk to Torii Hunter and a single by Hideki Matsui loaded the bases. He got Mike Napoli to ground into a 5-2-3 double play and struck out Cory Aldridge to preserve the A's 3-1 lead.	Oakland then scored twice in the bottom of the inning on Rosales' two-out single to break the game open. It's the A's second straight win after getting swept by the Yankees and dropping the first game of this series against the Angels.	With the rest of the division losing, Oakland pulled within 7 1/2 games of leader Texas.	"It's a little bit of a confidence builder," manager Bob Geren said. "After losing the first one, coming back to win the next two was a real nice accomplishment going into the break. "	It's the second time Oakland has tagged Weaver (8-5) with a loss this season.	The Angels starter, who was beaten by the A's on June 8 in Oakland, allowed an RBI double to Suzuki in the first and Cust's two-run homer in the fourth. He left one batter after Rosales' two-run single made it 5-1 in the sixth.	Weaver had been solid in his previous five starts, going 3-1 with a 2.43 ERA. With seven strikeouts against the A's, the righty passed Seattle's Felix Hernandez and San Francisco's two-time NL Cy Young winner Tim Lincecum for the major league lead with 137.	The Angels scored one run in the eighth off Oakland reliever Craig Breslow and had the tying run at the plate with two outs before Michael Wuertz struck out pinch-hitter Paul McAnulty.	Bailey then worked the ninth, allowing Erick Aybar's one-out single before retiring Howie Kendrick and Abreu to end the game. He and Cahill then made a short car trip to the Oakland airport to board their plane for the All-Star Game.	"It was funny because I had heard some stuff about it, that if Trevor threw a pitch Weaver was going to take his spot, and if Weaver threw a pitch I was going to take his spot," Bailey said. "I was down there cheering each and every first pitch. Guys in the bullpen were giving my high-fives and stuff. It was exciting."	Game notes	 Geren said LHP Dallas Braden could return from the DL against Boston on July 20. Braden, who pitched a perfect game May 9, has been sidelined with elbow stiffness. ... A day after getting the first hit of his major league career, Aldridge went 0 for 3 ... Cust recorded his fifth career stolen base in the sixth. ... Abreu's homer is his fifth against the A's this season. ... The Angels have lost three straight series for the first time since 2007 ... Los Angeles IF Kevin Frandsen is hitless in his last 19 at-bats.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

SEATTLE -- CC Sabathia doesn't mind being a spectator at the All-Star Game, even if his resume in the first half of the season is more than deserving of being the American League's starting pitcher.	Sabathia allowed one run in seven innings and won his eighth straight decision, and New York roughed up the Seattle Mariners for an 8-2 victory Sunday. The Yankees head into the All-Star break with baseball's best record.	Despite his stellar stats, Sabathia will have to watch the Midsummer Classic in Anaheim. A new rule disallows any pitcher who started Sunday from participating in Tuesday's game. His spot on the American League roster was given to Detroit's Justin Verlander.	But Sabathia might be the best pitcher in the AL as the break arrives.	"I had a pretty good second half in Milwaukee a couple years ago," Sabathia said. "There's still a long way to go, still a lot of baseball left so I just wanna keep going."	With his victory over Seattle, Sabathia (12-3) joined Tampa Bay's David Price as the only 12-game winners in the American League. In his last eight starts, Sabathia has gone at least seven innings and given up three earned runs or less in all eight. His win on Sunday made Sabathia the first Yankee to win eight straight starts since Roger Clemens in the 2001 season.	"He's that type of pitcher, when he gets on a roll, when things get right he can be extremely effective," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "He's using all his pitches, his velocity has been great, his location has been great. He's in a good groove."	The World Series champions are 56-32 and have a two-game lead over the Rays in the American League East. New York has won nine of 11.	After starting the season a pedestrian 4-3, Sabathia has been dominant since the beginning of June. His eighth straight victory looked easy against the punchless Mariners. After consecutive singles from Casey Kotchman and Justin Smoak in the second inning, Sabathia set down the next 11 before Michael Saunders' single leading off the sixth.	Sabathia struck out one and walked one. Only once did Seattle put together any sort of rally when three consecutive hits plated the Mariners' first run in the sixth inning. Chone Figgins had the RBI single that scored Saunders. Kotchman added a solo homer in the ninth.	Meanwhile, the Yankees knocked around Seattle starter Ryan Rowland-Smith for six hits and six runs in just four innings. Rowland-Smith (1-9) wasn't helped by two errors that allowed two unearned runs in the first inning.	Mark Teixeira is one of the few Yankees stars not headed to the All-Star Game, but is rolling as the break arrives. Teixeira went 4 for 5 on Sunday with two doubles -- once helped when Saunders lost a fly ball in the sun. Since June 8, Teixeira is hitting .316, with 11 doubles, nine homers and 26 RBIs.	"I do want to take a break, but at the same time hopefully when I get back I will still be swinging the bat well because I do feel pretty good up there right now," Teixeira said.	The Mariners looked more than prepared to for a three-day break to try and forget a miserable first half. The expectations of contending in the AL West were long ago replaced by the debate of if the Mariners will lose 100 games for the second time in three seasons.	First inning errors by Jose Lopez and Figgins set the tone, accentuated by three wild pitches and a hit batter by Rowland-Smith. Seattle enters the All-Star break having lost 9 of 11.	"Right off we make some errors to make Rowland-Smith have to get five outs in the first inning. I thought he was a victim more than anything," Seattle manager Don Wakamatsu said. "There were some tough conditions with the sun, but that is no excuse for the errors early in the game."	Game notes	 Sabathia is the first Yankee since Mike Mussina in 2002 to win at least 12 games before the All-Star break. ... Seattle LHP Erik Bedard played catch on Sunday, will throw a bullpen in Anaheim next weekend and still may have a minor league rehab assignment as he continues his recovery from shoulder surgery. ... Ichiro Suzuki extended his hitting streak to 13 games with a sixth-inning single. ... Yankees TV analyst John Flaherty, a former big league catcher, caught a foul ball on the fly in the booth.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PHOENIX -- Finally, after two weeks, the Florida Marlins are going home -- and they're going as winners.	Their often-maligned bullpen came on strong as manager Edwin Rodriguez used six pitchers in a 2-0 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Sunday that wrapped up a marathon 13-game trip.	Jorge Cantu doubled in a run and Dan Uggla had an RBI single for the Marlins, who went 7-6 on a journey that began June 28 with a three-game series against the New York Mets in Gonzalez's native Puerto Rico.	"It was a very important win. We've got some momentum," said Gonzalez, who was managing at Triple-A New Orleans when he was called on to replace Fredi Gonzalez on June 23. "Although we've got the [All-Star] break, the spirit, the atmosphere of the clubhouse is different."	Burke Badenhop (1-5) threw just two pitches in relief of starter Alex Sanabia but got the victory. Leo Nunez threw the ninth for his 20th save in 25 opportunities.	Brian Sanches, who pitched two scoreless innings, did not begrudge the scorekeeper's decision to give Badenhop the victory.	"I won't say he didn't deserve it," Sanches said. "He came in with the bases loaded and got the double play."	Uggla was asked to describe the trip.	"Very long," he said. "We let a couple slip away but we're going in the right direction."	Arizona was 3-7 in a home stand that began with the firing of manager A.J. Hinch and the promotion of Kirk Gibson to interim manager.	"I am different. I'm making them aware of different things," Gibson said. "The pitching overall did a pretty good job. Hitting-wise we have been clear about where we want to see improvement and we want to see that more consistently. That is a work in progress for us. All in all you can't single out any specific area. You win or you lose.	"I would rather play a real crappy game and win. There is something to winning, there is something to becoming winners."	The Diamondbacks outhit Florida 8-5 but were stung by three double plays, one with the bases loaded, and stranded six runners. Barry Enright (1-2), in his third big-league start, allowed both runs in five innings.	"I was a little tentative at the beginning, especially in that fourth inning," Enright said. "I got behind some counts, didn't field my position with Ramirez's hit up the middle. I did pitch tentatively but all and all I didn't pitch bad in my eyes. I always said it is kind of a process, learning and I will come out stronger next time."	Relievers Jose Veras and Clay Hensley also were part of the Marlins' shutout.	Sanabia moved into the rotation in place of Chris Volstad, who was optioned to Triple-A New Orleans after going 1-6 with a 5.22 ERA in 11 starts since May 7.	The Marlins scored twice without an out in the fourth.	Hanley Ramirez singled off the glove of Enright, stole second and scored when Cantu doubled over the glove of Justin Upton in right field, the only extra-base hit of the game. Cantu took third when Kelly Johnson overthrew the catcher on the relay, then scored when Uggla singled.	Arizona had runners at first and third with no outs in the first when Chris Young walked and Johnson singled, but Upton and Miguel Montero popped out and Mark Reynolds struck out.	Chris Young, Arizona's lone All-Star, singled twice. The second came in the eighth, when he was out after Johnson's liner struck him in the right big toe. He said afterward he was fine.	Upton led off the ninth with a shot to left that would have been a double had he not slipped and fell rounding first base. He ended up getting stranded there.	Uggla went 2 for 4 and has hit safely in 10 of his last 12 games, hitting .435 (20 of 46) in that span. Many of them have been singles, but that is fine with the Marlins' slugger.	"You take hits and RBIs when you can get them," Uggla said. "It doesn't matter if they're by singles, walks, home runs, doubles, triples. Any time you can get runs across is a huge positive."	Game notes	 The Marlins face Washington rookie sensation Stephen Strasburg in their first game after the break Friday night in Miami. ... Before Sanabia's start Sunday, Florida was the last NL team to go with five starters all season. ... The Marlins hit into two double plays. ... Reynolds has 20 home runs and has 56 RBIs but is hitting just .214. He struck out three times to increase his major league-leading total to 122 and is on pace to threaten the major league record of 223 he set last year. ... Florida is 10 games behind NL East leader Atlanta.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

LOS ANGELES -- Vicente Padilla was mixing his pitches and speeds, blissfully unaware he had a no-hitter going through five innings.	It didn't last, but Padilla's form sure held up.	He threw eight innings of two-hit ball and James Loney hit a three-run homer off Carlos Silva before the Cubs pitcher was ejected in the second inning, leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 7-0 victory over Chicago on Sunday night in baseball's last game before the All-Star break.	"We never really got anything going," Xavier Nady said. "He was pounding the strike zone and he had good stuff."	The Dodgers took three of four from the Cubs and are tied with Colorado for second in the NL West, two games back of surprising San Diego.	"We're better than that," Dodgers manager Joe Torre said. "Ten over is satisfactory because we had to deal with a lot of injuries."	The sluggish Cubs finished the first half 9 1/2 games behind NL Central-leading Cincinnati.	"We've got to try to put a streak together early. We can't waste any time," All-Star Marlon Byrd said. "We've wasted enough time. It's time to put it in gear and find out if this team has a switch or not."	Padilla (4-2) struck out six and walked one in his longest outing of the season, improving to 3-0 with a 1.25 ERA in his last three starts. The right-hander artfully mixed 55-mph curveballs with fastballs clocked at 95 mph to baffle the Cubs lineup.	"Guys don't seem to be able to put the fat part of the bat on it and you get quick outs," catcher Russell Martin said of Padilla's slow pitch. "I don't know how he throws it for strikes."	Starlin Castro doubled leading off the sixth for Chicago's first hit and Ryan Theriot led off the seventh with another double. Theriot also doubled in the ninth against All-Star fill-in Hong-Chih Kuo.	Padilla retired three straight after Castro's hit and escaped another jam after Theriot's first double. He hit Byrd with a pitch but Aramis Ramirez popped out, Nady flied out to left and Alfonso Soriano hit a fly ball to right to end the seventh.	"When a guy's throwing a two-hit shutout, has been pinpoint all day long, and then you get hit with a four-seamer, you have to question it sometimes," said Byrd, who played with Padilla in Texas and Philadelphia. "That's why I looked at him and smiled. Whether he did it or not, you've got to ask him."	Padilla denied anything deliberate.	Loney connected in the first, giving Padilla an early cushion. He hit Silva's first pitch into the right-field pavilion for his sixth homer.	Rafael Furcal hit a leadoff double and Matt Kemp walked to set up Loney's drive.	The Dodgers added three more runs in the second. Kemp hit a bases-loaded sacrifice fly, Loney had an RBI single and Mitch Atkins walked Xavier Paul to force in the third run.	"This game and the last I had a great lead and I really thank my teammates for that," Padilla said in Spanish through a translator. "My fastball had a good location and that was what was mainly working."	Silva didn't last long. He was ejected by umpire Brian Runge for arguing a close play at first base in the second inning.	Loney hit a grounder down the first-base line and Nady smothered the ball, then tried to beat Loney to the bag. A replay showed Nady got his foot on the bag first, but Runge ruled Loney safe. Silva, who ran over to cover, protested vehemently to Runge.	"He got over there late, first of all, but we saw the guy out at first base. That was the main complaint," said Cubs manager Lou Piniella, who came out to argue the call a night after being ejected. "Silva said something to the umpire and the umpire kicked him out of the ballgame.	"I'll tell you what, this crew here, I don't want to see them the rest of the year. I usually don't complain about umpires, but boy, we never got a call all weekend."	Silva (9-3) allowed six runs and six hits in 1 1/3 innings, walked three and struck out two. He injured his upper right calf at Arizona last Tuesday.	"He wasn't driving off his back leg very well," Piniella said. "He should be much better his next time out, about eight or nine days from now."	Game notes	 The Dodgers own a 1,021-1,018 lead over the Cubs in a series that began in 1890. ... It was the Dodgers' seventh shutout and fifth at home. ... The Dodgers optioned RHP John Ely to Triple-A Albuquerque and recalled RHP Jon Link. ... Piniella said he'll spend the three-day All-Star break boating on Lake Michigan with his wife, son and future daughter-in-law. ... Torre plans to "hang out" and watch the game. ... Dodgers PA announcer Eric Smith paid tribute to late Yankees announcer Bob Sheppard, who died Sunday, by saying each player's number a second time after introducing them.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  A terrible toss to first base. A fly ball that fell just short. An O-fer by their boppers.	This sure was shaping up to be another lost night for the National League.	Then, one key swing by Brian McCann and a heads-up play by right fielder Marlon Byrd ended an inexplicable All-Star funk.	McCann hit a three-run double in the seventh inning, Byrd alertly threw out David Ortiz to slow a ninth-inning rally and the NL captured its first Midsummer Classic since 1996 with a 3-1 victory Tuesday night.	"Enough was enough," St. Louis pitcher Adam Wainwright said.	In a year of dominant pitching, young starters David Price and Ubaldo Jimenez set the tone -- and got even more help from the tricky shadows. Nearly the entire field at Angel Stadium was bathed in odd patterns of sunlight for a twilight first pitch, creating more awkward swings and misses than usual in baseball's annual talent show.	Even that bouncing Rally Monkey on the big screen in a red AL jersey couldn't change things this time. The National League earns home-field advantage in this year's World Series.	"It's a big deal. I think home teams play better at home," said NL manager Charlie Manuel, whose Phillies have reached the last two World Series and won in 2008. "It feels good, it feels real good. I talked to our guys before the game and told them how important home-field advantage was."	The AL didn't go down without some ninth-inning drama, started by Ortiz's leadoff single. But Jonathan Broxton sealed it, helped by Byrd's defense and shaky baserunning by Big Papi.	Ortiz was on first with one out when John Buck hit a blooper that Byrd scooped up and threw to second for a forceout on the slow-moving Boston DH.	"Wrong place, wrong time -- and the wrong guy, too," Ortiz said. "I saw where he was playing, but I didn't know that Marlon Byrd's a guy who has great speed in the outfield. So I saw him coming in and I thought he was going to catch it. I just didn't want to get caught in a double play, so I got in between, it bounced in front of him and he made a good throw to second base."	With Alex Rodriguez standing on the steps in the AL dugout, Ian Kinsler flied out and the NL had its win. A-Rod never got in the game.	"It felt awesome for us to get the win and break the streak," Broxton said.	Washington closer Matt Capps got the win with just five pitches, striking out Home Run Derby champion Ortiz. Yankees starter Phil Hughes took the loss after allowing two hits before Matt Thornton yielded McCann's decisive double.	Until MVP McCann cleared the bases, Robinson Cano's fifth-inning sacrifice fly stood as the lone run in a game expected to be decided by the loaded pitching staffs on each side. McCann's deep fly ball to the warning track in right gave the NL hope in the fifth. When he made good with that bases-loaded double off Thornton, Atlanta's steady catcher hit second base and pumped his right fist. The three guys who scored headed to the dugout with a renewed swagger.	"You dream of moments like this as a kid. It was amazing," said McCann, a five-time All-Star relatively unknown before this night.	Cano and his fellow Yankees All-Stars wore black armbands after the death of longtime New York owner George Steinbrenner from a heart attack earlier Tuesday in Tampa, Fla., at age 80. Pictures of The Boss showed on two video screens before a pregame moment of silence, and flags hung at half-staff.	"It's a difficult time, on a great day for baseball, the All-Star Game, something everyone looks to," Yankees and AL manager Joe Girardi said. "A great man in baseball passed. He's meant so much to not only this organization, but to the game of baseball, and to all of us personally."	It took the NL 14 years to break through after several close calls. The National League lost the last two 4-3, including that 15-inning affair in 2008 at Yankee Stadium. The two before that were also one-run defeats. In 2002, they tied 7-7.	Phillies chairman Bill Giles had razzed Manuel that his job was on the line if the NL didn't finally win again.	Turns out this National League lineup didn't need star Washington rookie Stephen Strasburg -- though the phenom pitcher might have generated a nice buzz around the ballpark in those early innings.	Jimenez, Colorado's 15-game winner and first-time All-Star, came out of the gate with two scoreless innings. Price -- who at 24 was the youngest All-Star starter since 23-year-old Dwight Gooden of the Mets in 1988 -- matched that. Then came Marlins ace Josh Johnson, two more.	It took until the fifth inning for hitters to start making regular contact, the shadows all but gone aside from a couple of small patches in the outfield. With a first-pitch temperature of 85 degrees, this was a steamy summer night even by Southern California standards.	Neither offense did much to excite a relatively quiet Orange County crowd of 45,408. There were noticeable empty seats high in the third deck of right field.	Heath Bell's all-out sprint in from the bullpen to face local Angels favorite Torii Hunter generated some of the only roars all night.	"McCann came up with that three-run double, and that can break your back with the pitching they have over there," Hunter said. "It bummed me out, but I was having so much fun out there, playing in my own ballpark. That's what this game is really all about -- having fun."	The NL squandered its best early opportunity with runners on the corners and one out in the fifth. Justin Verlander struck out Corey Hart and got McCann on the long fly to right.	Dodgers reliever Hong-Chih Kuo put the AL in good position -- men on second and third with no outs -- when he stopped Joe Mauer's comebacker and sailed a routine throw to first high over the head of Adrian Gonzalez.	Evan Longoria scored the go-ahead run, which was unearned.	Manuel was surprised not to see A-Rod, the Yankees star with 597 career homers. Girardi considered using him as a pinch runner if the tying run got aboard in the ninth.	"We had a couple of situations where I could have gone in, but it was up to him on which situation to put me in," Rodriguez said. "Joe probably decided it was best -- unless he really needed me -- not to use me. ... It would have been fun, but maybe next time."	The NL leads the overall All-Star Game series 41-38-2.	Game notes	 Seattle's Ichiro Suzuki made a record ninth start as the AL's leadoff hitter, in his 10th All-Star Game. ... The game was the 11th played in California and third in Anaheim. San Francisco last hosted in 2007. ... Rangers slugger Vladimir Guerrero, the AL designated hitter batting fifth, was cheered by his former crowd when he came out in a Texas uniform. He tipped his cap and waved to acknowledge the crowd. ... Rod Carew tossed out the ceremonial first pitch to Hunter. ... St. Louis' Yadier Molina became the first NL catcher to start in back-to-back All-Star Games since New York's Mike Piazza in 2004-05. McCann replaced Molina in the fifth.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

BOSTON -- The Texas Rangers couldn't wait for the All-Star break.	And then they couldn't wait for it to end.	Josh Hamilton took over the major league batting lead with three doubles, helping the Rangers get off to a quick start in the second half with a six-run first inning on their way to a 7-2 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Thursday night.	"Before the break, I felt like we needed a break. Some of the guys were tired," Hamilton said. "Everybody got some rest and we came out stronger."	Bengie Molina homered as Texas batted around in first inning against Tim Wakefield. Nelson Cruz and Vladimir Guerrero had three hits apiece for the Rangers, who lost their last four games heading into the break -- against the lowly Baltimore Orioles -- to open July with a 3-8 record.	"I think the break came at the right time," said Rangers manager Ron Washington, whose team had gone 21-6 in June. "We were tired. When you play hard for as long as we did, it takes something out of you. We needed the days off, and it couldn't have come at a better time."	Tommy Hunter (6-0) held Boston to five hits before leaving with a 7-2 lead with two outs in the seventh. He walked two, struck out one and hit a batter while allowing solo homers to Bill Hall and J.D. Drew.	Hamilton raised his batting average to .351 before being replaced by a pinch runner in the seventh inning because of soreness in his calf behind his right knee.	"It was just tight," he said, adding that there was no need for an X-ray or MRI. "I could have stayed in and kept playing. I thought it might be a good time for a break."	Boston has lost six of its last eight games. Tim Wakefield (3-8) had his shortest outing since September 2008, allowing six earned runs on eight hits and striking out two before leaving three batters into the third inning.	"I'm as dumbfounded as anybody else," Wakefield said. "I felt like I had some of the best stuff I had all year coming out of the bullpen, but I just didn't have it tonight."	The Red Sox had only five regular starters in the lineup because of injuries to Dustin Pedroia, Adrian Beltre, Victor Martinez and Jacoby Ellsbury. Felix Doubront has been called up from the minors to pitch on Friday because of injuries to Clay Buchholz and Josh Beckett.	The Rangers entered the game with a 4½-game lead in the AL West despite being swept by Baltimore in the last four games before the All-Star break. That included Hunter's worst start of the season, in which he took a 4-1 lead into the seventh but didn't get an out in the inning; the Rangers blew the lead and lost 6-4, and Hunter got a no-decision.	"I left them in a bad situation in my last outing," he said.	They didn't wait long to turn things around.	After Wakefield struck out Elvis Andrus to lead off the game, he gave up six straight hits. Michael Young, Ian Kinsler and Guerrero all singled, Hamilton doubled and Cruz singled to make it 4-0. Molina hit a two-run homer before Wakefield got the bottom two in the order to end the inning.	After a 1-2-3 second inning, the Rangers put three straight batters on -- one on Hall's error at third base -- to make it 7-0 and chase Wakefield.	"They strung together a bunch of hits," Red Sox manager Terry Francona said. "He came out in the third and it looked like it was going to be another tough inning so I had to go get him."	Robert Manuel inherited runners at second and third and nobody out and pitched out of the jam to avoid further damage.	Game notes	 The Red Sox observed a moment of silence before the game for former Yankees owner George Steinbrenner and public address announcer Bob Sheppard. ... The Rangers signed OF Josh Richmond, a 12th-round pick from the University of Louisville, and assigned him to Spokane of the Northwest League. ... Wakefield is 2-6 with a 6.75 ERA in nine starts since May 28. ... Hall made a diving catch on Molina in the fifth to deprive him of extra bases down the line. ... Texas, which stole nine bases against Wakefield on April 20, stole one on Thursday to extend its streak to 35 in a row without being thrown out. Cruz was caught trying to advance to second on a pitch in the dirt that was not ruled a stolen base attempt.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

ATLANTA -- Jason Heyward's impact in his return from a thumb injury was lost in the boxscore.	Heyward was hitless in four at-bats in his first game with the Atlanta Braves since June 26, but the rookie's lead role on the field was unmistakable.	Two standout plays by Heyward in right field helped Jair Jurrjens give up only one run, and the Braves beat the Milwaukee Brewers 2-1 on Thursday night.	"Defense wins games and defense allows good things to happen," Heyward said.	Martin Prado and Chipper Jones hit home runs in the third inning off Dave Bush (4-7).	Corey Hart's 22nd homer gave Milwaukee a 1-0 lead in the first inning. It was the only run allowed by Jurrjens, who gave up five hits and two walks with three strikeouts in 6 2/3 innings.	Jurrjens (2-3) earned his second win in three starts since returning from a hamstring injury.	Billy Wagner pitched a perfect ninth for his 21st save.	The first-place Braves began the night four games ahead of the Mets in the NL East.	Heyward was voted to start in Tuesday's All-Star Game but could only watch as he remained disabled with a left thumb injury. He came off the 15-day disabled list against the Brewers and delivered two great defensive plays. Milwaukee's Casey McGehee was the victim on each play.	McGehee led off the second with a single. Jim Edmonds followed with a single to right, and Heyward threw out McGehee at third base. Heyward's strong throw to Jones beat McGehee by such a wide margin that McGehee made no apparent attempt to touch the bag on his wide slide.	In the fourth, Heyward smashed into the right-field wall after making a running catch to rob McGehee of a hit. The impact near the foul line knocked Heyward to his back on the warning track, where he remained as Braves manager Bobby Cox and assistant trainer Jim Lovell hurried out of the dugout.	Heyward said he was ready when Cox and Lovell, joined by umpire Joe West, made it to the outfield corner.	"I just started telling them my name; I knew where they were going [to ask questions]," he said.	Fans applauded as Heyward remained in the game. He said he remained on his back for a minute because he didn't think it would be smart to stand up too quickly.	Cox said the two plays "may have won us the ballgame."	Jurrjens said he had no doubt.	"He won the game," Jurrjens said of Heyward. "He made a really awesome throw."	Brewers manager Ken Macha called McGehee's attempt to advance to third base "ill-advised."	"One of the cardinal rules of baseball is you don't make the first out at third base," Macha said.	Macha had praise for Heyward's defense.	"He definitely has a good arm," Macha said. "And that was a fine catch he made."	Alex Gonzalez, acquired in Wednesday's five-player trade that sent Yunel Escobar to the Toronto Blue Jays, had a walk and a double in his debut with the Braves.	Bush allowed no more than two earned runs for his sixth straight start. He allowed seven hits and two runs in six innings.	"It was a well-pitched game on both sides," Macha said. "[Atlanta's] pitching is pretty good, both their starters and their bullpen."	Bush had too little support as the Brewers had only six hits.	"We just couldn't find the holes tonight," said Rickie Weeks, who was 0-for-4.	"It's unfortunate, when you consider how well he has pitched, we haven't been able to put up some runs for him," he said.	Bush gave up more than one homer in a game for the first time since April 25, when he gave up four homers in 3 2/3 innings in a 12-2 loss to the Cubs.	The temperature for the first pitch was 90 degrees. Many in the crowd of 35,057 fanned themselves through the hot night.	Game notes	 Right-hander LaTroy Hawkins (right shoulder) began a rehab assignment in Arizona with the Brewers' rookie team. The Brewers are pointing to a July 26-28 home series against the Cincinnati Reds for Hawkins' possible return. ... The Braves placed left-hander Eric O'Flaherty on the 15-day disabled list with a viral infection. The move is retroactive to July 10. Left-hander Mike Dunn was recalled from Triple-A Gwinnett. ... Shortstop Brandon Hicks was optioned to Gwinnett to clear a roster spot for Heyward.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO -- Lou Piniella finally got a glimpse of what he envisioned the middle of the Chicago Cubs' lineup would be.	Aramis Ramirez hit a pair of two-run doubles, and Derrek Lee and Geovany Soto each had two-run homers to lead the Cubs to a 12-6 win over the Philadelphia Phillies on Thursday night.	Alfonso Soriano also hit a solo homer for the Cubs, who scored nine of their 12 runs with two outs. Starlin Castro also stole home on a botched suicide squeeze in the second inning.	For most of the first half, Piniella got little offense out of Ramirez, who struggled with an average below .200 for most of the first half and Lee, who is considerably off his lifetime average of .284.	But on Tuesday night, Lee and Ramirez gave Piniella some optimism for a strong second half.	"This is what we hoped for," Piniella said. "This is what we talked about: a lot of hitting and the long ball and extra-base hits. Good ballgame for us. We talked about it -- 3, 4, 5, 6. That's the big part of your lineup and when they're doing some damage, you're going to score some runs and today they did some damage and we scored a lot of runs."	Cubs starter Ryan Dempster allowed two runs on six hits with three walks and nine strikeouts. Dempster (8-7) rebounded after allowing a long two-run homer to Ryan Howard -- his first of two in the game -- in the first inning.	"I know everybody wants to count us down and out and the season to be over with," Dempster said, "but we refuse to do that and we're just going to go out there and play hard. It was a big game for us."	The Cubs tagged Phillies starter Jamie Moyer (9-9) for six runs on five hits in three innings. He allowed two home runs and hit two batters. In his last two starts, he has allowed 13 runs in 8 1/3 innings.	Phillies manager Charlie Manuel is concerned with his pitching staff.	"We know what we got, how our guys pitch. We need consistent pitching. We've got holes," he said.	After a four-game sweep of the Cincinnati Reds before the All-Star break, the Phillies failed to match a season-high five-game winning streak and fell 5½ games behind first-place Atlanta in the NL East.	The Phillies' bats didn't come awake again until the ninth inning. Shane Victorino and Raul Ibanez had a pair of two-out RBI singles in the ninth off Cubs reliever Bob Howry. Howard then chased Howry with another long two-run homer to right field.	Andrew Cashner got Jayson Werth to pop out to end the game.	Moyer, who started his career with the Cubs in 1986, couldn't hold an early 2-0 lead. The 47-year-old left-hander hit Tyler Colvin on the right shoulder in the first inning. With two outs, Moyer plunked Marlon Byrd on the left knee, and Ramirez followed with a double down the left-field line. Ibanez tried to play the ball off the brick wall, but it took a bad bounce and allowed Byrd to score from first to tie it at 2.	"Tonight, I struggled to put a finger on it on the field," Moyer said. "I just felt that if I made good pitches down I'd be fine, but I made bad pitches down, I made bad pitches up and paid for it. I didn't execute."	In the second inning, Castro lined a triple over the head of Victorino in center. It looked as if Victorino might have a play, but he misjudged the ball and took a step in. With Dempster up, the Cubs attempted a suicide squeeze, but the pitcher wasn't able to get the bunt down. But the ball got by catcher Carlos Ruiz, allowing Castro to steal home.	He became the first Cubs player to record a straight steal of home since April 13, 1996, when Brian McRae did it in the first inning at San Francisco. Castro finished the game 3-for-4, falling a home run short of the cycle.	After getting the first two outs in the seventh, Phillies reliever Jose Contreras allowed a leadoff single to Lee. He hit Byrd with a pitch and Ramirez followed with another two-run double. Soriano drove in Lee on a bloop single, and Soto followed with his 10th homer of the season to chase Contreras.	"The track record shows that we hit," Dempster said. "Sometimes whether it's injuries or funks or whatever sometime they take a little while to get out of."	With the bases loaded in the eighth, Soriano hit a two-out RBI single off reliever Danys Baez.	Game notes	 Cubs right-hander Carlos Zambrano completed has anger management sessions and reported to Arizona on Thursday to resume throwing. He has been on the restricted list since June 29, and has not been with the club since his June 25 dugout tirade that led to a verbal confrontation with Lee. The Cubs do not have a timetable on Zambrano's return to the majors. ... Phillies INF Placido Polanco began a rehab assignment with Single-A Clearwater on Thursday night and went 1-for-4 with a run scored. ... Ramirez had his first two-double game since July 24, 2009, against the Reds.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MINNEAPOLIS -- Ozzie Guillen has made no secret of his admiration for the Minnesota Twins over the years.	The outspoken Chicago White Sox manager loves how the Twins have done all the little things right, relying on pitching, defense and fundamentals to wear opponents down en route to five division titles this decade.	Seven years into his tenure, Guillen finally has his team playing like those pesky Twins of old, and to fantastic results.	Gordon Beckham had a home run and two RBIs and John Danks recovered from his worst inning of the season to help the White Sox win their ninth game in a row, 8-7 over the Twins on Thursday night.	Danks (9-7) gave up six runs on six hits in the second inning, but only allowed three hits in his other five scoreless innings and the White Sox did all the little things right to push the slumping Twins 4½ games behind them in the AL Central.	"We've been playing good baseball," said catcher A.J. Pierzynski, a former Twin. "We've been catching the ball, we've been pitching, just doing things right. We've kind of been playing Twins baseball. Just catching the ball and throwing strikes and doing what we need to do to win."	Bobby Jenks picked up his 20th save in 21 chances. He struck out Orlando Hudson with the bases loaded in the eighth inning, then gave up an RBI single to Delmon Young in the ninth before getting Jim Thome looking to end the game.	Chicago perfectly executed four hit-and-runs, bunted runners over and played superb defense for their 26th win in the last 31 games.	"When you're up against those guys you try to shut them down as quick as you can," Guillen said. "That's the only way to beat them. We all know how they play the game. We all know how they don't give up."	The Twins lost for the seventh time in nine games and suffered through another terrible outing by their starting pitcher. Kevin Slowey was tagged for five runs on nine hits in three innings and Alex Burnett (1-2) gave up three more runs in relief.	"It wasn't a very good performance," manager Ron Gardenhire said of Slowey. "He didn't get the ball where he wanted to. He was up in the zone."	Juan Pierre had three hits and an RBI and Alex Rios added two hits and two RBIs for the White Sox.	Joe Mauer had three hits and three RBIs and J.J. Hardy chipped in two hits and an RBI for Minnesota.	These two teams were headed in opposite directions going into the break, with the White Sox going 25-5 to take a half-game lead in the division. It's been a startling turnaround for a team that was 24-33 and 9½ games down on June 8.	The White Sox scratched their way to a 4-0 lead early thanks to three sacrifice flies and Beckham's solo homer that reached the second deck in left field.	"I've been struggling and searching for it a lot more than I've been comfortable out there lately," Slowey said.	The Twins responded in the bottom of the second inning, scoring six runs on six hits, including Joe Mauer's bases loaded double down the third baseline that gave them a 6-4 lead.	But Danks settled down after that facing just one more batter than the minimum while the White Sox climbed back into the game. Beckham had an RBI-single in the fourth and A.J. Pierzynski's two-run double highlighted Chicago's three-run fifth inning to put them back in the lead.	In a role reversal, it was the Twins this time who committed the blunders to let the game slip away to the smarter, sharper White Sox.	Denard Span popped up a bunt attempt to Danks in the fourth and Burnett balked home the tying run in the fifth when he never let his pitch to Mark Kotsay go.	The Twins have just six wins in their last 20 games and will play this entire series without All-Star first baseman Justin Morneau, who was placed on the disabled list with a concussion.	The biggest concern, though, is the starting pitchers, including Slowey, Nick Blackburn and Scott Baker, who have all been wildly inconsistent this year.	"It's the same group that took us a long way last year and we won a division with them," Gardenhire said. "Our job is to get them right as much as we can. If it doesn't work out, we have to make a decision and make a move."	Game notes	 Twins LHP Brian Duensing, one of their most valued relievers, was not available because of illness. ... Rios's single in the sixth inning was career hit No. 1,000. ... Twins RF Jason Kubel went 1 for 5 with four strikeouts. ... Gardenhire said Twins INF Matt Tolbert's finger is still hurting and he will remain on the disabled list for the time being.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

ST. LOUIS -- Chris Carpenter looked like an All-Star again. The break did Clayton Kershaw no good at all.	Improved mechanics allowed Carpenter to go after hitters instead of trying to trick them. He was in command, allowing four hits in eight innings of the St. Louis Cardinals' 7-1 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Thursday night.	"I definitely felt better," Carpenter said. "I've still got some work to do, but no question it was way better than it's felt the last two times."	Rookie Allen Craig got the first two RBIs of his career without a hit off Kershaw (9-5), who dug his own hole with consecutive walks on 11 pitches to start the Cardinals' two-run first, meriting a quick visit from pitching coach Rick Honeycutt. Kershaw also got tagged with a liner off his right leg for an infield hit by Aaron Miles in the second and allowed four earned runs in 4 1/3 innings with one strikeout.	"Just a rough night," Kershaw said. "You saw it, I made some all right pitches. I was out of rhythm early."	Kershaw fanned 12 in his last pre-All-Star break outing a week ago in a victory over the Chicago Cubs but faltered mostly due to a lack of control against a lineup that featured eight right-handed bats.	"No command," manager Joe Torre said. "His breaking ball had no sharpness to it. He hadn't pitched in a week, you've got to chalk it up to that."	The lone left-handed hitting starter, Colby Rasmus, walked and doubled in three at-bats against Kershaw.	"He's aggressive and I'm aggressive, so it's a good matchup," Rasmus said.	Andre Ethier homered and singled for the Dodgers, who committed errors on consecutive plays in St. Louis' two-run fourth.	Carpenter (10-3) and the San Francisco Giants' Tim Lincecum were the only two National League pitchers not used in the All-Star Game, by arrangement because both had starts scheduled for Thursday. The right-hander looked much sharper than in a pair of losses before the break in which he permitted 11 runs in nine innings. He retired the first seven batters to open the game and eight in a row after Ethier's 15th homer with one out in the fourth.	"That's six days' rest, and he was strong," manager Tony La Russa said. "He was nails all night long."	Carpenter struck out six with no walks. He's 6-0 with a 1.77 ERA against the Dodgers, including seven scoreless innings June 8 at Los Angeles without a decision, and 19-4 against the NL West.	Two of Albert Pujols' three hits came off Kershaw, who allowed one run in 15 innings in two previous starts in St. Louis. Counting a first-round playoff sweep last October, St. Louis had lost six in a row to the Dodgers.	Manny Ramirez was 0-for-3 with a fielding error in left after being activated from the 15-day disabled list earlier in the day. Ramirez misplayed the bounce on Yadier Molina's single to open the fourth and shortstop Rafael Furcal followed with a wild relay to the plate on Miles' RBI single as the Cardinals took a 4-1 lead.	Plenty of cushion for Carpenter.	"He's so good," Torre said. "He knows what to do with the lead. He frustrates you because he can pitch in and around the strike zone and he can throw a strike anytime he wants."	Rookie Jon Jay, a defensive replacement in right field in the sixth inning, had an RBI double in the seventh to extend his hitting streak to 12 games. He's batting .500 (19-for-38) during the longest current streak in the league.	Felipe Lopez had been 0-for-13 against Kershaw before his RBI double in the fourth. Craig, recalled from Triple-A Memphis earlier in the day, had a run-scoring groundout and sacrifice fly.	Game notes	 Kershaw failed to qualify for a victory for only the third time in 19 starts. He had allowed two or fewer runs in nine of his previous 12 outings. ... Carpenter hasn't lost three straight decisions since 2002, when he lost four in a row with the Toronto Blue Jays. ... Carpenter has allowed 15 homers, 11 with the bases empty, after surrendering seven all last season. ... The Cardinals are 12-3 against the Dodgers at 5-year-old Busch Stadium.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Judging by his 0-for-5 performance, Torii Hunter could have used another day off after virtually hosting Angel Stadium's All-Star festivities over the past few days.	The rest of the Los Angeles Angels used the break to refuel an offense that was running on empty last week.	Erick Aybar and Bobby Abreu drove in three runs apiece, Joel Pineiro won his seventh straight decision, and the Angels roared back from the break with 16 hits in an 8-3 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Thursday night.	Two days after the NL won 3-1 in a snoozer of an All-Star game, the ballpark finally hosted an entertaining contest with plenty of highlights -- almost entirely from the Angels, who had scored just 14 runs in their previous seven games.	"Coming back from the All-Star game and scoring some runs helps this team a lot," said Abreu, who has seven hits and six RBIs in his last four games. "It's what we're looking for. If we keep doing it this way, we're going to be in good shape."	Howie Kendrick had a run-scoring double for the Angels, who stumbled into the break with eight losses in 10 games, including a 1-6 road trip on which they were outscored by 30 runs. Those problems evaporated under unusually dark skies in Anaheim, where every Angels starter except Hunter -- their only All-Star game participant -- had at least one hit.	"For a long time, we've had some soft spots in the lineup," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "We've talked about it for a while. Tonight, we got clutch hits in scoring position, hit the ball hard, and cashed in on those opportunities."	Aybar and Jeff Mathis had three hits apiece to back Pineiro (10-6), who gave up six hits over seven innings. After a slow start to his first season with the Angels, the former Seattle right-hander had won six consecutive starts before getting a no-decision last Friday in Oakland despite leaving with a 5-3 lead after seven innings.	"Defense and good run support," Pineiro said when asked to reveal his winning formula. "That's all I can ask for. Hopefully that's a good start for us in the second half, and we can keep on rolling. Hopefully the other guys feed off that."	All-Star Ichiro Suzuki hit a three-run double and threw out the speedy Aybar at the plate for the last-place Mariners, who have lost 10 of 12. Seattle has lost eight of 10 to its AL West rivals this season.	The Angels methodically pounded Seattle starter Doug Fister (3-5), who gave up 12 hits and six runs. Taking the rotation spot that would have been occupied by traded star Cliff Lee, he pitched into the sixth inning of his fourth consecutive loss, his ERA rising from 3.09 to 3.50.	"He's got some big shoes, but each guy on this team has a role, and that's where we're slotted in," Fister said. "So there's no more added pressure or anything different. It's a matter of going out and playing the game that we know how to play."	Pineiro got into trouble only in the fifth, giving up four straight hits capped by Suzuki's double in the gap. Pineiro has started each of the Angels' last three victories while becoming their first 10-game winner this season, beating All-Star ace Jered Weaver.	After Aybar led off the first with a single and scored on Abreu's double, the Angels went up 4-0 in the second with five consecutive one-out hits. Aybar's drive to right scored two runs, but Suzuki threw him out when he attempted to score from first on Kendrick's double.	Suzuki, who has a 14-game hitting streak, also attempted to score from third on Franklin Gutierrez's sharp grounder in the fifth, but Mathis tagged him out at the plate.	"Fister was getting hurt early in the ballgame because he left some pitches up," Seattle manager Don Wakamatsu said. "He gave up 12 hits, but seven of them were groundballs. In the fourth and fifth, I thought he had the best stuff he had all night."	Game notes	 Pineiro won a career-best eight straight decisions in 2003. ... Before the game, Seattle signed veteran RHP Jamey Wright and promoted LHP Chris Seddon from Triple-A Tacoma. The 35-year-old Wright debuted for his eighth major league team in the seventh inning, allowing Mathis' RBI single. ... Seattle LHP Erik Bedard felt discomfort in his throwing shoulder while playing catch. Bedard will travel back with the team to Seattle on Sunday to see team physician Edward Kahlfayan, and might get an MRI or a CAT scan. Dr. Lewis Yocum, who performed surgery on Bedard's torn labrum last August, checked on Bedard in the Mariners' clubhouse. ... Mariners 1B Russell Branyan sat out after banging his toe into a table in his hotel Thursday morning.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Any disappointment San Francisco Giants fans may have had over not seeing Tim Lincecum pitch in the All-Star Game was quickly erased by how sharp he looked in the first game back from the break.	Lincecum pitched a six-hitter for his fourth career shutout and Pablo Sandoval hit an RBI double to help the San Francisco Giants open the second half of the season with a 2-0 victory over the New York Mets on Thursday night.	"I think it's evident the rest probably did him well," manager Bruce Bochy said. "The first inning you could tell he was fresh. It was nice that he didn't pitch in the All-Star Game and we could use him tonight."	NL manager Charlie Manuel held Lincecum (10-4) in reserve Tuesday night in case the All-Star Game went extra innings. When he wasn't needed in that game, the Giants decided to pitch him in the first game back from the break.	Coming off seven days of rest, Lincecum looked as good as he has all year against the Mets. The two-time NL Cy Young winner struck out five and walked one in the 110-pitch outing. He now has had two straight strong starts after a rare pair of rough outings against Boston and Colorado. He has allowed one run in the past 16 innings after giving up eight in nine innings over his previous two starts.	"It was good for both the team and myself," Lincecum said. "It was a confidence builder. Coming out of the first half, ending it the way I did, I wanted to keep that going."	San Francisco has won eight of 10 games following a seven-game losing streak.	The Mets' only real threat against Lincecum came in the fifth inning when Josh Thole hit a line drive through the box that glanced off Lincecum's back for a single. That put runners on first and second with no outs. But Lincecum retired the next three hitters, getting Angel Pagan on a flyout to right field with runners on second and third to escape the jam.	"I don't know if my stuff was the best, but I was definitely throwing stuff where I wanted to," Lincecum said. "I was throwing pitches in when I needed to, backdoor breaking balls when I needed to and making good pitches when I had to."	The fans cheered loudly when he was sent to bat in the bottom of the eighth inning and he responded by slapping a single to left field. He then finished the Mets off on the mound with a perfect ninth for his first shutout since throwing a two-hitter against St. Louis on June 29, 2009.	"It's a little tough to come back and face a guy who is that sharp," Mets manager Jerry Manuel said.	The only real hard hit the Mets delivered came when Alex Cora hit a foul ball into the Giants' dugout that hit Bochy and left him with a welt on his right jaw.	"I'm OK. I took one for the team," Bochy said. "Guys were scattering in the dugout and we lost sight of it. But it's worth it."	The Mets were hoping for a big offensive boost this game with the return of five-time All-Star Carlos Beltran to the lineup. Beltran had been out since undergoing offseason surgery on his right knee. He batted cleanup and played center field, but was caught stealing after his only hit in the game.	"I was trying to pick up the catcher's sign," Beltran said. "I saw two fingers and I just felt that I was going to be able to make it. I guess when you drink too many coffees and too much sugar before the game, it makes you do crazy things."	The Mets managed just five other hits off Lincecum in the opener of an 11-game road trip. Lincecum needed to be sharp in this game as the Giants struggled to generate much offense against knuckleballer R.A. Dickey (6-3).	Dickey allowed just five hits in seven innings and was only really threatened in the second.	Buster Posey led off that inning with a single and advanced to third on a groundout and wild pitch. Sandoval then lined a ball off the brick archways in right field so hard that it rolled almost to center field before Pagan chased it down.	"He is a good hitter and he hit a pitch," Dickey said. "We tried to go in on him [with a fastball] and he was ready for it. It's easy to go back and say it was a mistake, but if he pops it up it's not a mistake."	The Giants managed nothing else against Dickey, but won for just the third time in 29 games this season when they scored two or fewer runs. They added a run in the eighth on an RBI fielder's choice by Posey.	Game notes	 Mets All-Star SS Jose Reyes missed the game with a sore right side. ... The Giants improved to 3-0 this season against knuckleballers, having beaten Charlie Haeger of the Los Angeles Dodgers in April and Boston's Tim Wakefield last month.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO -- With temperatures heating up, so is Aramis Ramirez's bat.	Stuck in a slump most of the season, the Cubs' cleanup hitter is finally doing what he's been known for most of his career in Chicago -- driving the ball and knocking in runs.	Ramirez hit a solo homer with two outs in the bottom of the eighth Friday, sending the Cubs to a 4-3 comeback win over the Philadelphia Phillies.	"Yeah I feel pretty good at the plate. Even when I make out, I've been able to hit the ball hard," Ramirez said. "That's a good sign."	Ramirez's 11th homer came off Ryan Madson (2-1) and cleared the left field bleachers for his fifth homer and 14th RBI in the past eight games. He had three hits to raise his batting average to .220 as the Cubs beat the two-time defending NL champs for the second straight game.	"He's staying on the ball well. He's taking good swings at pitches and he's driving the ball. It's big difference from the first half. One of the ingredients that was missing here obviously," Chicago manager Lou Piniella said. "And now it's back."	Sean Marshall (6-2) pitched the eighth in relief of Ted Lilly and Carlos Marmol struck out the side in the ninth for his 17th save in 20 chances.	Ryan Howard hit his 20th homer with two outs in the sixth, a drive onto the roof of a batter's eye seating section in straightaway center. It was his third home run in two games and it put the Phils up 3-1.	After Howard's blast, the Cubs rallied for two in the bottom of the inning with a two-out rally of their own off Joe Blanton as Ramirez doubled and Marlon Byrd followed with his 10th homer, tying it at 3.	Shane Victorino also homered for the Phillies off Lilly on a 90-degree day at Wrigley Field.	It appeared that some of the Phillies were not crazy about plate umpire Marty Foster's strike zone. Jayson Werth was called out three times. Philly fanned 14 times overall in the game -- 10 times against Lilly -- and took eight called third strikes.	"[Lilly is] mostly around the plate. Some of the other guys the zone might have been a little big, expanded from what they were saying. It happens. I can only really speak for myself," Howard said.	"That's the way we've been hitting," Philadelphia manager Charlie Manuel said. "That's why we've had trouble. We take a lot of strike threes. We've been taking a lot [pitches]. We haven't hit for a long time."	Blanton pitched seven innings and gave up five hits and three runs with three walks while tying a season-high with eight strikeouts.	Lilly, who can be a free agent after the season, has been the subject of numerous trade rumors and met Thursday with general manager Jim Hendry to discuss his Cubs' future.	He made it clear he wants to stay, but knows it will be difficult for the Cubs to get back in the race at nine games under .500.	"His job is to do what is best for the organization," Lilly said of Hendry.	And after two shaky starts in which he gave up 14 earned runs and 18 hits, Lilly retired the first 10 batters he faced before surrendering Victorino's career-best 15th homer with one out in the fourth.	Lilly's final line was similar to Blanton's. He surrendered three runs and four hits in seven innings with a walk and his season-high 10 strikeouts.	Cody Ransom and Carlos Ruiz had back-to-back singles with one out in the fifth before Lilly got called third strikes past Wilson Valdez and Blanton.	Chicago tied the game in the fifth when Blanton walked Lilly, who was hitless in 26 at-bats this season, on a 3-2 pitch with two outs and the bases loaded.	Ramirez singled and Soriano walked before Blanton intentionally walked Geovany Soto to load the bases and face Lilly, who worked the walk after falling behind 1-2.	"It was kind of an out-of-body experience," Lilly said. "I don't know why I swung at the pitches I swung at or why I laid off the ones I did. Fortunately it worked out."	Game notes	 Manuel said 3B Placido Polanco could be activated from the DL (sore left elbow) and be in the lineup Saturday. He's been on a rehab assignment at Class A Clearwater. ... Victorino hit 14 homers in 2008.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

BALTIMORE -- Ricky Romero didn't care about strikeouts or checking his numbers on the radar gun.	The Toronto Blue Jays left-hander was only interested in getting outs, and the strategy worked perfectly against the Baltimore Orioles.	Romero allowed five hits in seven innings, Aaron Hill homered and the Blue Jays ended Baltimore's four-game winning streak with a 4-2 victory Friday night.	Fred Lewis had two hits and scored twice for the Blue Jays, who improved to 7-0 against the Orioles this season, including 4-0 in Baltimore. Toronto was 1-8 at Camden Yards last year.	Romero (7-6) gave up two unearned runs, walked one and struck out five. He retired the first 12 batters and allowed hits in only the fifth and seventh innings.	Romero was 0-3 in his previous three starts, yielding a combined 13 earned runs over five innings in the last two.	So what was the difference in this one?	"We went back to basics: Try to throw pitches for strikes and try to make them hit it," he said. "Not trying to get swings and misses but just, 'Here, hit it.' I'm at my best when I'm down in the zone, getting groundball outs, getting quick outs."	Two Toronto errors in the fifth inning enabled Baltimore to close to 3-2, but Romero made the lead stand up.	"We got him in a little bit of trouble by playing some bad defense behind him," manager Cito Gaston said, "but when he needed to throw a strike or throw the ball by someone, he did it."	After Shawn Camp struck out Adam Jones with two outs and runners on second and third in the eighth, Kevin Gregg worked a perfect ninth for his 21st save.	Hill had three hits, including Toronto's major league-leading 137th home run. The Blue Jays have homered in nine straight games, collecting 22 over that span.	Yunel Escobar, obtained in a trade Wednesday with Atlanta, went 1-for-4 with a walk in his Toronto debut.	"I was a little nervous," he said. "It was like I was a rookie in the big leagues for the first time."	Felix Pie, Julio Lugo and Ty Wigginton had two hits apiece for the Orioles, who swept a four-game series in Texas before the All-Star break to match their season high for wins.	In their return, Baltimore stranded six runners and went 3-for-10 with runners in scoring position.	"Romero made some pitches when he needed to," interim manager Juan Samuel said. "Not one sticks out, but we had opportunities and we didn't get that one big hit. That's going to happen."	Brad Bergesen (3-7) allowed four runs and nine hits in six innings. He is 0-5 in his last eight starts.	"Early on I struggled a little bit, felt like I was a little rusty," said Bergesen, referring to 3-0 hole he put the Orioles in after three innings. "But I chewed up some innings, kept us in the game. Hopefully I can build off that."	Toronto got a first-inning run when Lewis hit a leadoff double, took third on a bunt single by Escobar and scored on a fly to center by Vernon Wells.	Hill led off the second with his 13th homer, the second in two games, and an RBI single by Adam Lind made it 3-0 in the third.	Baltimore got within a run in the fifth. Wigginton singled to left, the first Oriole to reach base, and took second when Lewis misplayed the ball. Pie singled, and Lugo drove in a run with a two-out infield hit before Edwin Encarnacion botched a grounder to third, allowing Pie to score.	Successive doubles by Hill and Lyle Overbay made it 4-2 in the sixth.	Game notes	 Toronto's seven-game winning streak over Baltimore is its longest since an eight-game run from Sept. 18, 2002, to June 23, 2003. ... Bergesen has allowed 20 hits in his last two starts. ... Toronto right-hander Shaun Marcum (elbow) could come off the 15-day disabled list this weekend, Gaston said. ... Baltimore is 8-22 in the first game of a series.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CLEVELAND -- Andy Marte and Austin Kearns hit two-run homers, the Cleveland Indians' latest offensive boost.	Marte broke a 2-2 tie in the fourth inning off Max Scherzer (6-7) and Kearns capped a four-run sixth to help Cleveland open the season's second half with an 8-2 win over the Detroit Tigers on Friday night.	The Indians also had two doubles and a triple, giving them an extra-base hit in 38 consecutive games since being one-hit by Detroit's Armando Galarraga in his near perfect game on June 2.	Tigers manager Jim Leyland said a 2 p.m. workout at Progressive Field apparently didn't knock the rust off after four days of inactivity during the All-Star break.	"We were sluggish in every phase," Leyland said. "We were sloppy defensively. We were sloppy on the bases. The pitching wasn't good. We didn't hit good. We didn't manage good. We didn't do anything good. It's very disappointing."	Detroit remained one game behind first-place Chicago in the AL Central despite losing to a team it has dominated of late. The Indians improved to 7-20 since the start of 2009 against Detroit, which has faded in the second half of recent seasons.	Jake Westbrook (6-5) gave up two runs over 5 2/3 innings to win his first home start against Detroit since Sept. 18, 2007. The right-hander missed most of 2008 and all of 2009 following reconstructive elbow surgery.	"I would have liked to go longer, but making 32 pitches in the first inning makes that tough," Westbrook said. "But this was a big win. We want to have a good second half and this is the way to start it."	Miguel Cabrera extended his hitting streak to 20 games with a run-scoring single to put the Tigers ahead 1-0 in the first. Austin Jackson singled on the 10th pitch to open the game, stole second, and scored on Cabrera's two-out liner off the left-field wall.	"I'm not here for personal stuff," said Cabrera, who leads the majors with 78 RBIs. "I'm here to win games. It's a tough loss. We have to forget about this."	Cleveland took a 2-1 lead in the second. Matt LaPorta walked and scored from first when Trevor Crowe sliced a shot down the left-field line that went for a triple. Left fielder Brennan Boesch ran over to cut off the ball, which caromed off a wall in foul territory and bounced past him.	After Marte walked, Crowe scored on a fielder's choice grounder by Jason Donald.	Magglio Ordonez doubled to open the Tigers' fourth and eventually scored on a groundout by Boesch to tie it 2-2.	Marte hit his third homer of the season, on a 3-2 pitch to make it 4-2.	"I had a lot of 3-2 counts," said Scherzer, who walked five over five innings. "I was sick of walking people 3-2. I challenged him with a fastball and he hit it."	Leyland was not happy with Scherzer, whose wildness didn't hurt his chance at extend his career-best winning streak to five.	"Not good," Leyland said. "His control was bad. Five walks. Totally out of sync."	Carlos Santana had a sacrifice fly and Travis Hafner followed with an RBI single in the sixth to make it 6-2. Kearns then connected for an opposite-field homer to right off Brad Thomas.	Scherzer had been 5-2 with a 2.44 ERA since being recalled from Triple-A Toledo on May 30, but gave up four runs, five hits and five walks over five innings, striking out seven. He dropped to 1-5 with a 5.61 ERA in nine road starts overall.	"I didn't give the team a chance to win," Scherzer said. "I didn't have a good outing."	Game notes	 Marte started in place of 3B Jhonny Peralta, who missed an off-day practice Thursday with a fever. Indians manager Manny Acta said Peralta had improved and was available, but he rested the veteran as a precaution. ... Cabrera went 1 for 3 and is hitting .341 (61 of 179) with 13 homers and 42 RBIs in 45 career games against Cleveland. ... Detroit is expected to recall RHP Rick Porcello from Triple-A Toledo between games of a day-night doubleheader Saturday -- to start the second game. ... LHP David Huff was scratched from a scheduled start Friday night at Triple-A Columbus and could be called up Sunday to start for the Indians. ... Cleveland officially released C Mike Redmond, who was designated for assignment July 10. ... Indians SS Asdrubal Cabrera, out since mid-May with a broken left forearm, was the DH Friday night on a rehab assignment at Double-A Akron. ... Indians OF Michael Brantley snapped an 0-for-21 streak with a sixth-inning single. ... Detroit fell to 16-18 in the division and 16-26 on the road.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

NEW YORK -- On a night filled with touching tributes, Nick Swisher found the most fitting way to honor George Steinbrenner.	Swisher hit a game-winning single with two outs in the ninth inning and the New York Yankees ended a Friday evening full of tears and cheers by beating the Tampa Bay Rays 5-4.	Manager Joe Girardi cried during a 15-minute pregame remembrance. Captain Derek Jeter worked hard to keep his composure while speaking to the crowd. Closer Mariano Rivera placed two long-stemmed roses across home plate in memory of the team's demanding owner and beloved public address announcer Bob Sheppard.	"On a day like this when we celebrate his life, got to take him out on a W," Swisher said. "Today was Mr. Steinbrenner's day. Regardless of the situation, regardless of anything, we went out there and we played that game as best we could for him today."	Swisher hit a tying home run in the eighth, then lined a single that sent Curtis Granderson sliding home for the victory in a matchup of the teams with the best records in baseball. The Yankees streamed from the dugout to celebrate, and Swisher wound up way out in right field, surrounded by jumping teammates.	"I thought the club played like Mr. Steinbrenner expected," Girardi said, sniffling. "I think The Boss would have been proud."	The joyful ending was in sharp contrast to earlier events that saluted Steinbrenner, who died Tuesday, two days after the passing of Sheppard.	There was a 2-minute moment of absolute silence. Not a single fan shouted out, and the only sounds were the flags flapping at half-staff and a passing subway.	It was muted inside, by design. To honor Sheppard, who was 99 and announced players in dulcet tones for more than a half-century, there were no PA introductions. Even the Bleacher Creatures in right-center field held off on their daily roll call.	A season after the Yankees christened their new stadium by celebrating a World Series title, the ballpark was quiet.	So it was, too, in the days of old Yankee Stadium. Famed for hosting championship parties, the park also was the site for many of baseball's most solemn occasions -- Lou Gehrig's "luckiest man" speech, a dying Babe Ruth propped on a bat and bidding farewell, an empty catcher's box for Thurman Munson.	"It's just one of those moments, another one of those special moments here at Yankee Stadium," Jeter said. "It seems like every time you come here there's an opportunity to see something special, and tonight was special for everyone that had the opportunity to participate in the game and I think also for everyone that got a chance to watch it."	Hours before gametime, crowds snapped pictures of Steinbrenner's statue in the main lobby and gathered around a makeshift memorial outside another gate.	The Yankees wore patches for Steinbrenner and Sheppard. One included "The Boss" and the other featured a microphone.	Between innings, the video board showed clips of Steinbrenner, including his skits on "Saturday Night Live" and commercials with Billy Martin.	"It's a weird feeling when you don't have that extra noise at a ballpark, and I think that changes the atmosphere," Girardi said. "Every half-inning you have that reminder of how special of a man he was. And you get caught up in all that, listening to all the stories."	When it was over, a recording of Sheppard played over the sound system. "Thank you for coming to the game," he said.	Rivera (3-1) picked off B.J. Upton at first base in the ninth. Granderson opened the bottom half with a single against Randy Choate (2-3).	Ramiro Pena sacrificed, Brett Gardner walked and Jeter was next. The whole crowd stood anticipating a winning hit -- "he comes to the plate and I'm thinking the same thing," Upton said -- but Jeter took big cuts and struck out.	Swisher, however, lined a single and Granderson beat right fielder Gabe Kapler's throw.	"I think pretty much the agenda today was win. That's what Mr. Steinbrenner wanted us to do," Swisher said.	CC Sabathia and James Shields began the day going in different directions, and both wound up with no-decisions. Sabathia had won eight straight outings, Shields had lost eight of nine starts.	Robinson Cano and Jorge Posada hit consecutive home runs off Shields in the sixth to tie it at 3.	"It was an emotional game for the stadium," Shields said. "Once the game started, it was business as usual."	Tampa Bay took a 4-3 lead in the seventh against Sabathia on an RBI groundout by Ben Zobrist.	Swisher homered off Joaquin Benoit in the eighth. Swisher also had an RBI single in the third.	Game notes	 The Yankees and Tampa Bay have split six games this year. They play 12 more times. ... Saturday is Old-Timers Day at the stadium. The 1950 championship team is being honored, with Whitey Ford and Yogi Berra among seven players from that club expected to attend.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PITTSBURGH -- The Houston Astros certainly aren't the only team beating the lowly Pittsburgh Pirates. They're just the one doing it with the most regularity.	Jeff Keppinger homered and had three RBIs, Brett Myers allowed two runs while working into the eighth inning and the Astros remained unbeaten in seven games against the National League's worst team this season with a 5-2 win Friday night.	Myers (7-6) extended his club record for consecutive starts of at least six innings to begin a season to 19 by allowing two runs on five hits in 7 2/3 innings, striking out four and walking one.	"I'm just trying to do my job; I'm not really trying to go out there and overpower guys or anything like that," Myers said. "I'm just trying to throw strikes and get us into the dugout as quick as possible."	Matt Lindstrom worked a perfect ninth for his 22nd save in 26 opportunities.	Andrew McCutchen went 2 for 4 with an RBI and a run for Pittsburgh, which has lost seven consecutive overall.	Making his first start in exactly one month, the Pirates' Zach Duke (3-9) pitched five effective innings, allowing two runs on five hits with no walks and five strikeouts. But he lost for the ninth time in his last 10 decisions.	"I feel good," Duke said. "I felt like the stuff was crisp, the curveball was good, the changeup was good, the fastball was down, so I like where I'm at physically."	In the Astros' first game with former star Jeff Bagwell as their hitting coach, the team scored at least five runs for only the third time in its past 10 contests.	This despite being without cleanup hitter Carlos Lee, who was not in the lineup a day after he missed a voluntary team workout in Pittsburgh to end the All-star break.	Keppinger, 7 for 13 in his past three games, has hit three of his four home runs this season in his past six games. He also had an RBI double in the seventh and drove in Jason Bourgeois with a groundout in the first.	That meant the Pirates had allowed at least one first-inning run for the sixth time in their past seven games. This came without a ball reaching the outfield -- an infield single, two stolen bases and a groundout.	"Those are the things we've got to do, get the big hits with two outs, and we've got to be able to move runners around," Keppinger said.	Houston took a 2-0 lead with two outs in the second when Humberto Quintero doubled in Hunter Pence.	McCutchen scored on Neil Walker's sacrifice fly in the fourth.	D.J. Carrasco relieved Duke in the sixth, and Keppinger took the first pitch he threw and hit it just inside the left-field foul pole to make it 3-1. Later that inning, Pence scored on a squeeze play with Angel Sanchez at the plate.	The Pirates chased Myers in the eighth when McCutchen's two-out single drove in Lastings Milledge. Jose Tabata followed with a single off of Brandon Lyon, but Walker's sinking liner to left was caught by a running Bourgeois to end the threat.	"All wins feel good, but it was nice to see the guys play real well," Houston manager Brad Mills said. "They really did a good job defensively, and offensively we did some things that are good. ... Then, of course, it's always good to lean back on Myers having such a big outing."	The Pirates threw two wild pitches, had a balk, a runner picked off second and failed to record an out when they had Pence caught in a rundown in the fourth.	"Not the kind of game you're looking for anytime," Pittsburgh manager John Russell said. "A few too many mistakes, mental lapses. But again, we've got to take some heat off those mistakes by scoring some runs, and we just didn't do it. Myers was good."	Game notes	 After the game, the Astros placed RHP Brian Moehler on the disabled list due to a strained right groin. It was retroactive to July 8. The move was necessitated because RHP Felipe Paulino (right shoulder tendinitis) will be sent back to Houston to have an MRI performed after a setback during a throwing session Friday. He will not come off the disabled list in time to start Tuesday, as scheduled. ... The Pirates have had five losing streaks of at least five games this season. This is the third time they have lost seven in a row.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BOSTON -- When slow-footed Bengie Molina went to the plate needing a triple to hit for the cycle in cozy Fenway Park, his manager had a question for Michael Young.	"Where do you think he has to hit it for a triple?" Ron Washington asked his third baseman. "He said, 'Nowhere in this ballpark.'"	Ian Kinsler, the last Texas Ranger to hit for the cycle, was equally pessimistic.	"I would have bet everything I own that Bengie Molina would never hit for the cycle," he said with a smile. "Ever."	Molina surprised them both and powered Texas to an 8-4 win over the Boston Red Sox on Friday night, becoming the eighth player and first catcher since 1900 to hit for the cycle with a grand slam. The last player to do that was Minnesota's Jason Kubel on April 17, 2009.	Molina completed his feat in the eighth inning when he hit Ramon Ramirez's pitch to the deepest part of Fenway into the center field triangle 420 feet from home. The ball bounced off the glove of Eric Patterson for only the sixth triple of Molina's career.	"When I saw the ball going away from him, I just put my head down and kept going," Molina said. "For a guy who has been criticized for his speed for 11½ years and may be the slowest guy in the world, it was an unbelievable feeling."	Molina, obtained from the San Francisco Giants on July 1 to shore up a team weakness at catcher, looked over his right shoulder at Patterson as he rounded second and lumbered into third then smiled at teammates in the dugout. A few pitches later, he left the game with tightness in his right quadriceps after slipping rounding first.	He was replaced by pinch-runner Joaquin Arias, who scored the final run of the game on a sacrifice fly by Young.	Molina is the fifth player in Rangers history to hit for the cycle and the first since Kinsler on April 15, 2009. The triple was Molina's first since April 29, 2009. The last catcher to hit for the cycle was Chad Moeller with Milwaukee against Cincinnati on April 27, 2004. And the last visitor to hit for the cycle at Fenway Park was Cleveland's Andre Thornton on April 2, 1978.	But Molina said the grand slam meant more. It came in the five-run fifth and broke a 3-3 tie.	"That was more special than the cycle actually, because it put us ahead," he said.	One night earlier, he capped a six-run first inning with a two-run homer and the Rangers went on to a 7-2 win.	"The last two nights every mistake we make he hits," Red Sox manager Terry Francona said. "He's knocking the ball all over the ballpark."	Molina's brother Yadier had a pretty good game himself for St. Louis on Friday, homering and driving in four runs in the Cardinals' 8-4 win over Los Angeles.	"He did? That's awesome," Yadier Molina said when told about his brother's big game.	The AL West-leading Rangers lost their last four games before the All-Star break but returned to take the first two of a four-game series against the Red Sox, who have lost seven of nine as injuries severely weakened their lineup.	Catchers Victor Martinez and Jason Varitek, second baseman Dustin Pedroia and outfielders Jacoby Ellsbury and Jeremy Hermida all are sidelined. Right-handed starter Clay Buchholz made a rehab start for Pawtucket on Friday night and Josh Beckett is scheduled to do the same on Saturday night.	Texas got off to a fast start again Friday with two runs in the first off Felix Doubront (1-2). Leadoff hitter Elvis Andrus reached second on a two-base throwing error by the pitcher and scored on Kinsler's single. Nelson Cruz singled in Kinsler.	Boston tied it in the second against Colby Lewis (9-5). Kevin Youkilis doubled and scored on J.D. Drew's single. Drew took third on a single by Beltre and scored on a wild pitch.	The game was delayed by rain for one hour after the third inning, and Adrian Beltre's solo homer gave the Red Sox a 3-2 lead in the fourth. Then the Rangers went ahead to stay in the fifth.	Young singled, took second on a wild pitch and stayed there on an infield single by Vladimir Guerrero. Doubront then caught a hard liner from Josh Hamilton, but threw wildly to second trying for an inning-ending double play and the runners moved to second and third.	That kept the inning alive as Doubront was replaced by Fernando Cabrera, who was called up from the minors on Friday.	"We talk all the time about giving them extra opportunities," Francona said. "That probably played itself out to the worst it could."	Cabrera walked Cruz and David Murphy, forcing in the tying run, then got ahead of Molina with an 0-2 count. After a ball, Molina homered to center, his fifth of the season and second with Texas.	Boston cut the lead to 7-4 in the sixth on Drew's sacrifice fly.	Game notes	 The Red Sox called up Cabrera from Pawtucket and optioned RHP Robert Manuel to the International League team. ... Kinsler extended his hitting streak to nine games. ... Both teams began the day with 51-38 records, but Boston was in third place in the AL East.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.
