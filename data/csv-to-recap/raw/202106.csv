PITTSBURGH -- — Even amid a slow start, Dave Roberts didn't need a reminder of all the things Mookie Betts can do to help the Los Angeles Dodgers win games.	Betts provided one anyway.	The star right fielder hit the 25th leadoff home run of his big league career and added a spectacular catch and throw double play as the Dodgers beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 6-3 on Thursday.	The Los Angeles manager predicted last weekend Betts was on the verge of a breakout. Betts certainly looked comfortable in the box while collecting two hits to boost his batting average to .255 while displaying the athleticism that makes him one of the most exciting defenders in the game.	Betts took the third pitch he saw from Mitch Keller (3-7) and sent it into the bullpen beyond the centerfield fence for his sixth homer this season. He then saved a run in the bottom of the second by making a running grab on a sinking line drive by Ka'ai Tom t hen doing a 360-degree turn before firing a one-hop strike to home plate to nail Pittsburgh's Erik Gonzalez.	“If you’re talking about the degree of difficulty on the catch, the turn, the accuracy and the arm strength, it would be hard to find a play that was tougher,” Roberts said.	Betts shrugged it off, saying it was mostly instinctual.	“I just saw it and I knew I’d try to do everything I can to stay on my feet,” Betts said. “And once I got to a point where I could catch it, I tried to get myself ready to throw and I felt the spin was the easiest way to get some momentum on the ball.”	And halt Pittsburgh's momentum in the process.	The play helped Julio Urías (9-2) became the first nine-game winner in the majors. Cody Bellinger and Justin Turner had two hits each and Zack McKinstry drove in two runs for Los Angeles. Phil Bickford picked up his first save when the game was called with one out in the top of the eighth inning after a rain delay of 1 hour, 15 minutes.	Urías worked six innings to give Los Angeles' overtaxed bullpen a little bit of a breather. Los Angeles relievers covered 7 1/3 innings in a rain-delayed 2-1 win on Wednesday night. Urías wasn’t particularly sharp — he allowed at least one base runner in each of the first four innings — but avoided major trouble while allowing three runs on six hits in six innings with no walks and five strikeouts.	He was also pretty handy with the bat. Urías lined a two-run single in the third off Keller after the Pirates intentionally walked catcher Austin Barnes to load the bases with two outs. The hit boosted the left-hander's RBI total this season to seven in just 29 plate appearances. Urías had just four RBI in the first four seasons of his career combined entering 2021.	“I just try to go up there and do what I can,” Urías said. "I said it before, I like to go out there and take some swings and do my job.”	The victory gave the Dodgers their sixth series sweep this season. It also matched their longest winning streak ever against Pittsburgh. They took 13 consecutive games from the Pirates from May 4-July 20, 1952, when the franchise was in Brooklyn.	KELLER SCUFFLES	Keller, who left his previous start last Friday after just two innings with what the team called "heat-related illness, remains a bit of an enigma. Penciled in to be part of the core of the team's rotation as the franchise goes through a massive overhaul, the 25-year-old struggled with his command. He walked three and hit a pair of batters while lasting just 2 2/3 innings and throwing only 41 of his 72 pitches for strikes as his ERA rose to 7.04.	“It’s just me going out and executing,” Keller said. "I had two batters 0-2 in the third inning. If I don’t hit them, it’s a whole different game. Just executing pitches is what it boils down to. Executing and getting ahead. When I do that, I’m pretty good. When I don’t, stuff like that happens today.”	Adam Frazier extended his hitting streak to a career-best 13 games but Pittsburgh has dropped four straight and is 11-27 over its last 38 games after briefly ticking over .500 (12-11) in late April.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: Placed RHP Luis Oviedo on the 10-day injured list retroactive to June 7 with a left quadriceps strain and activated RHP Trevor Cahill. ... 1B Colin Moran was held out of the lineup a day after taking a pitch off the hand of Los Angeles reliever David Price.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: Return to Dodger Stadium on Friday to start a three-game set with Texas. Clayton Kershaw (7-5, 3.66 ERA) faces Mike Foltynewicz (1-6, 4.75) in the opener.	Pirates: Travel to Milwaukee on Friday for a three-game series with the Brewers. Chase De Jong (0-0, 5.40) starts against Brandon Woodruff (4-2, 1.42 ERA).	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

CINCINNATI -- — A rain delay changed Freddy Peralta's plan to pitch deeper into Thursday's game. The Milwaukee Brewers' bullpen seamlessly finished what he started.	Peralta was rolling along through four innings and planning to pitch the fifth before the 37-minute delay. He had given up just two hits, one of them a Joey Votto homer in the second inning, but Brewers manager Craig Counsell decided not to get the right-hander up and warm warm again after the rain.	Four relievers kept Cincinnati in check, and Milwaukee cruised to a 7-2 win to take two of three from the Reds in the series. Brent Suter (7-3) allowed one run over two innings, and Brad Boxberger, Hoby Milner and Trevor Richards each threw a scoreless frame, with Richards striking out the Reds in order in the ninth.	“As soon as we got the delay and we knew it going to be more than 30 minutes, they told me I was done for the day," Peralta said. “I wanted to stay in the game and throw the fifth and sixth innings, but it is what it is.”	Jace Peterson drove in three runs, and Daniel Vogelbach hit a two-run homer as the Brewers won for the 11th time in 13 games.	Peterson, promoted from Triple-A Nashville at the start of the series, blooped a tiebreaking, two-run single in a three-run sixth and added an RBI double in the eighth.	Vogelbach homered in the seventh, his sixth this season and second in as many days.	“I was able to get some pitches today that I was able to to put a good swing on, get some extra-base hits,” said Vogelbach, who also walked and scored in the sixth inning and doubled in the ninth.	Luis Castillo (2-9) gave up one hit in 5 2/3 innings and struck out seven. He left with a 2-1 lead after walking two batters in the sixth. Lucas Sims gave up Willy Adames' run-scoring double and Peterson's single.	“I really had a good outing," said Castillo, who has struggled mightily this season. "I was battling all day. Even with the break in the game, I was able to focus.”	Votto tied the score 1-1 with a 400-foot homer leading off the second, his first long ball since he was activated Tuesday after missing a month because of a broken thumb.	Jesse Winker had an RBI single in the fifth. Nick Castellanos had two hits, raising his major league-leading batting average to .357.	BULLPEN WOES	The Reds bullpen, whose 5.81 ERA is the worst in the majors, had another tough day. Although the Brewers' two sixth-inning runs were charged to Castillo, it was Sims who surrendered RBI hits to his first two batters. He lasted just one-third of an inning. Sean Doolittle gave up another two runs, and Art Warren gave up another before Ashton Goudeau managed a scoreless ninth.	TRAINERS ROOM	Brewers: 3B Travis Shaw was put on the 10-day injured list after dislocating his left shoulder diving for a ground ball in the second inning Wednesday night. Luis Urías moved from second base to third for Thursday's game, and Peterson was installed at second. RHP Patrick Weigel was recalled from Triple-A Nashville to take Shaw's roster spot.	Reds: Manager David Bell said INF Mike Moustakas is running on his sore heel but a timetable for his return hasn't been set.	UP NEXT	Brewers: RHP Brandon Woodruff (4-2) is expected to start the first game of a weekend set against the last-place Pirates in Pittsburgh on Friday night. RHP Chase De Jong (0-0) is set to go for the Pirates.	Reds: RHP Tyler Mahle (5-2) will be on the mound Friday as the Reds start a weekend series against LHP Kyle Freeland and visiting Colorado. Mahle is 3-0 with a 1.04 ERA in his last three starts.	------	Follow Mitch Stacy at http://twitter.com/mitchstacy	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.

PHILADELPHIA -- — Jean Segura slowly jogged around first and watched Odubel Herrera dive headfirst across the plate for the winning run before another walk-off celebration began for the Philadelphia Phillies.	Segura's two-run single high off the left-field fence in the 10th inning gave the Phillies a 4-3 comeback win over the Atlanta Braves on Thursday.	“That's what I'm here for,” Segura said about his knack for clutch hits.	The Phillies took two of three from the three-time defending NL East champions, including a walk-off win Wednesday night on Luke Williams’ first big league homer with two outs in the ninth.	Freddie Freeman hit a solo homer off closer Hector Neris with one out in the ninth to tie it, and the Braves scored two runs off José Alvarado (5-0) on a wild pitch and passed ball in the 10th.	But Alec Bohm’s RBI single off Chris Martin (0-2) in the bottom half cut it to 3-2. Herrera followed with a double down the left-field line. Segura then hit a drive to deep left-center. He kept jogging around first, toward second and waited for teammates to mob him.	“I knew it was good enough to walk it off so that's why I (watched) it a little bit,” Segura said.	Zack Wheeler struck out 12 in eight dominant innings and Segura hit an RBI double in the eighth to give the Phillies a 1-0 lead but Freeman's 14th homer erased it. Herrera had a chance to rob Freeman but his jump was too far in front of the fence and the ball fell beyond his glove.	"I don’t think it’s a ball he should’ve caught, but it’s a ball he could’ve caught," Phillies manager Joe Girardi said.	Dansby Swanson started the 10th inning on second base, advanced to third on a bouncer to short and scored on Alvarado’s wild pitch after pinch-hitter Guillermo Heredia walked. Alvarado walked two more batters before a passed ball by third-string catcher Rafael Marchan allowed another run to score.	“It's been a weird year,” Braves manager Brian Snitker said. “You have to deal with the adversity, make adjustments and we have to get better. We're capable of it.”	Wheeler allowed four singles and no walks in his latest stellar outing. He lowered his ERA to 2.29 with his seventh straight start giving up three runs or fewer. Wheeler fanned every batter in Atlanta’s lineup except Swanson and recorded double-digit strikeouts for the 13th time in his career and fifth this season.	“I’ve had a couple good runs a couple different years, but it wasn’t like it is now,” Wheeler said. “The difference is I’m throwing the cutter more, the slider is better and I can command all of those pitches.”	Braves starter Ian Anderson also was impressive, yielding four hits and fanning four in seven scoreless innings.	“We feel like we're super close,” Anderson said. “We just have to keep to it. It's not a matter of if, it's when.”	The Phillies broke through against A.J. Minter when Herrera lined a double off the right-field fence with one out in the eighth. Herrera flipped his bat and hesitated to watch the ball before running to first and missed an opportunity to reach third when right fielder Ronald Acuña Jr. fumbled the ball.	Segura followed with a double down the left-field line to knock in Herrera.	“There will be discussions,” Girardi said of Herrera not running hard right away.	ROOKIE APPRECIATION	Hours after Williams' hit a two-run shot to give Philadelphia a 2-1 win, the rookie utilityman got a standing ovation and heard chants of “Luuuuuuuke” when he stepped into the batter’s box for his first at-bat.	DAY AND NIGHT	Anderson entered with a 5.14 ERA in three starts during the daytime this season.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Phillies: RHP Chase Anderson was placed on the COVID-19 injury list. ... SS Didi Gregorius (elbow) continues his rehab at Triple-A Lehigh Valley.	UP NEXT	Braves: RHP Charlie Morton (5-2, 4.21 ERA) starts the opener of a three-game series at Miami on Friday night.	Phillies: After a day off Friday, RHP Vince Velasquez (2-1, 4.33) takes the mound for the start of a two-game interleague series against the New York Yankees on Saturday night.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

DETROIT -- — Jonathan Schoop homered and Isaac Paredes hit a go-ahead single as the Detroit Tigers rallied from a first-inning deficit and took advantage of three errors to beat the Seattle Mariners 8-3 Thursday.	Mitch Haniger put Seattle ahead against Tyler Alexander with the first of his two solo homers, but the Tigers rallied to take two of three from the Mariners, who have lost six of nine following a five-game winning streak.	“We had good at-bats, even from the beginning of the game, and that gave us a chance to settle in,” Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said.	Joe Jiménez (1-0) pitched a 1-2-3 seventh for his first win since last Aug. 26. Alex Lange threw the eighth and Gregory Soto pitched a perfect ninth to finish the six-hitter.	In a planned bullpen game, Alexander allowed one run and three hits in 2 2/3 innings and relievers allowed three hits over the rest of the game.	Seattle’s Justus Sheffield (5-5) gave up five runs — three earned — and six hits in four innings, the shortest of his 11 starts this season.	Detroit is 26-36 overall but 5-1 against Seattle, with the only loss 9-6 on Wednesday.	“We got nothing going, and it started on the mound,” Mariners manager Scott Servais said. “Sheff was not on his game today — it’s really disappointing coming off a high last night. For whatever reason, we did not play well against the Detroit Tigers this year. They had our number.”	Shortstop Kyle Seager made two errors and second baseman Donovan Walton one as Seattle allowed two unearned runs.	Ty France was hit by a pitch in the fifth inning from Jason Foley, becoming the first player in Mariners history to be hit by pitches four times in a three-game span. Foley, a 25-year-old right-hander, made his first Comerica Field appearance, four days after his major league debut.	Jake Rogers homered in the third but Jake Bauers, making his Mariners debut after he was acquired from Cleveland, had an RBI grounder that cut the lead to 3-2 in the fourth.	Willie Castro’s sacrifice fly and Robbie Grossman’s RBI single put Detroit ahead 5-2 in the fifth.	“Robbie’s homer was tough on them because it let us separate a little bit," Hinch said. “In a bullpen game, you never know how much pitching you are going to have, so you need to score runs.”	Haniger’s 16th homer closed the gap in the sixth against Foley and gave him his fourth multi-homer game this season. Grossman hit a two-run homer in the bottom half, his eighth home run this season.	Rogers tripled home a run in the seventh.	“You can take extra bases in this ballpark more than most, and we want to put pressure on other teams," Hinch said. "Jake and Jonathan both did it today, and they don’t have more than average speed. That’s something we need to do in this park.”	TRADE	Following injuries to 1B Evan White and OF Kyle Lewis, the Mariners acquired Bauers for a player to be named or cash. Bauers went 1 for 4. ... 2B Jack Mayfield was designated for assignment.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Tigers RHP Rony Garcia sprained a knee during pregame warmups. He required assistance from the team training staff to make it off the field and was placed on the 10-day injured list. “It doesn’t look good.," Hinch said.	RHP Beau Burrows was recalled from Triple-A Toledo along with Lange and OF Daz Cameron. OF Derek Hill and LHP Derek Holland also were put on the 10-day IL.

BOSTON -- — J.D. Martinez hit his 13th homer, Christian Arroyo had a three-run drive and the Boston Red Sox took advantage of a pair of dropped balls in a five-run sixth inning to beat the Houston Astros 12-8 Thursday night, avoiding a three-game sweep.	Right fielder Kyle Tucker dropped Martinez's sacrifice fly that tied the score at 8 for an error as the batter reached, and shortstop Carlos Correa let Rafael Devers' bases-loaded pop to short center to glance off his glove but got the out because an infield fly was called.	“It was a tremendous change of emotions about eight times. We‘re cheering one moment and kind of lamenting the next moment,” Astros manager Dusty Baker said. “That was a weird ballgame. The whole game was very strange and it’s hard to explain. ”	Yuli Gurriel and José Altuve homered for the Astros, Altuve providing an 8-7 advantage leading off the sixth on a pitch from Darwinzon Hernandez that was 0.85 feet above the ground. According to MLB Statcast, it was the lowest pitch hit for a home run in the major leagues since the start of 2018.	“To manage these games is not fun, but I understand how people like it,” Red Sox manager Alex Cora said the odd plays	Baker did not make it to the end of the 3-hour, 47-minute game. He was ejected in the seventh for arguing after the Red Sox turned a double play on a ball that Yuli Gurriel hit into the dirt and maintained was a foul ball.	Darwinzon Hernandez (1-2) won after allowing Altuve’s homer.	Kiké Hernández doubled off Blake Taylor (0-1) leading off the bottom half and scored on Martinez's fly to deep right, where Tucker said the wind played with the ball as it descended.	“As it started coming down, it started fading back toward the infield and knuckling as it came down. I just clanked it off my glove,” Tucker said.	Xander Bogaerts walked, and for a moment it appeared Devers reached to load the bases before second base umpire John Tumpane signaled the infield fly for the second out.	Enoli Paredes relieved and loaded the bases with a walk to Hunter Renfroe, then hit Vazquez on the elbow with an 0-1 curveball, forcing in the go-ahead run.	Paredes walked Arroyo on six straight fastballs, putting Boston up 10-8. Brooks Raley relieved and Bobby Dalbec hit a two-run double.	Astros starter Zack Greinke allowed four runs and seven hits in three innings. Brandon Bielak, recalled from Triple-A Sugar Land on Wednesday, gave up three runs and four hits over two innings.	WILD WIND	The wind was coming from the east at 15 mph as the game started, but Baker said by the sixth it seemed to have picked up — especially high up above the stands where it could blow the ball around.	“Guys that never mess up fly balls, I could tell they were in trouble by the way they were moving and the way their feet were moving. Boy, that was a tough inning and a tough night for us,” Baker said.	BALL OF CONFUSION	Baker said he was most upset because he felt the umpires were confused on the call the led to his ejection and did signal it correctly, leading to the confusion.	“I said a couple magic words and that usually gets you tossed," Baker said. "Nobody knew what to do. They didn’t know what to do. Our baserunner didn’t know what to do.”	HOLD UP	Altuve thought he had a leadoff double in the fourth with a line drive off the Green Monster in left, but was thrown out by Alex Verdugo, who fielded the ball off the wall and threw to Arroyo at second. Arroyo had the ball before Altuve began to slide.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Red Sox: Verdugo returned after missing two games with tightness in his back. ... RHP Brandon Brennan was from Triple-A Worcester, where he made eight relief appearances and held opponents to two runs on six hits over 8 1/3 innings with a 2.16 ERA. … RHP Phillips Valdéz was optioned to Worcester.	UP NEXT	Astros: RH José Urquidy (4-3, 3.76 ERA) gets his first start since allowing six runs and nine hits over 4 1/3 innings Saturday against Toronto. Urquidy will face Twins’ RHP Matt Shoemaker (2-7, 7.28) as the Astros open a three-game series at Minnesota on Friday night.	Red Sox: RHP Garrett Richards (4-4, 3.88) faces RHP Ross Stripling (2-3, 4.71) Friday night in the opener of a four-game series against the Blue Jays.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

CHICAGO -- — Dallas Keuchel thinks he is heading in the right direction. That's a very positive development for a Chicago White Sox team dealing with another major injury.	Keuchel pitched six effective innings, Yasmani Grandal homered and Chicago beat the Toronto Blue Jays 5-2 on Thursday night.	The White Sox closed out a 5-2 homestand and improved their AL Central lead to a season-high 4 1/2 games over idle Cleveland. Adam Engel also went deep, and reigning AL MVP José Abreu hit two RBI doubles.	But it was Keuchel (5-1) leading the way in another solid performance after he pitched six sharp innings in a no-decision against Detroit in his previous start. Paying closer attention to his tempo, the veteran left-hander limited a dangerous Blue Jays lineup to two runs and six hits.	“Right now is where I thought I would be a little bit earlier in the season,” said Keuchel, who struck out a season-high eight and walked two. “But I'm 70-something innings in now, I'm liking where I'm headed. That's a nice feeling to have, especially when you're kind of searching earlier in the year for some success.”	Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said Keuchel was locating all his pitches.	“He had us off balance. Like nobody knew what's coming next,” Montoyo said. “So he did a good job. His cutter was moving pretty good today for sure. That's why you saw those awkward swings from us.”	It was the first game for the White Sox since they placed second baseman Nick Madrigal on the injured list with a torn right hamstring. Madrigal got hurt when he tried to beat out a grounder in the seventh inning of Wednesday night’s 6-2 loss to Toronto.	Chicago has been hit hard by injuries this year, but it keeps rolling along.	The loss of Madrigal is "a big blow, but the games still count and we have to go forward,” manager Tony La Russa said.	Marcus Semien and Lourdes Gurriel Jr. each drove in a run for Toronto, which lost for the fourth time in six games. Hyun Jin Ryu (5-4) pitched six innings of three-run ball after struggling in his previous start against Houston.	“A lot of my pitches felt a little better, but with the changeup, I still felt a little awkward,” Ryu said through a translator.	Infield hits by Joe Panik and Santiago Espinal set up Semien's two-out RBI single in the fifth. A mental gaffe by White Sox third baseman Yoán Moncada paved the way for the Blue Jays' second run in the sixth.	With one out and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. on first, Moncada fielded Randal Grichuk's grounder and threw to first instead of going to second to get the lead runner. Guerrero advanced on a wild pitch and scored on Gurriel's two-out single, trimming Chicago's lead to 3-2.	But Keuchel escaped the jam by retiring Riley Adams on a fly ball to center with two runners on. Engel then hit his first homer of the season in the seventh, sending a solo drive deep to center against Anthony Castro.	After Keuchel departed, Evan Marshall and Codi Heuer each got three outs before Liam Hendriks worked the ninth for his AL-leading 16th save.	The White Sox got off to a fast start against Ryu, scoring three times in the first. Abreu doubled home Yermín Mercedes before Grandal hit an opposite-field drive to right for his 10th homer.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: OF George Springer (quad strain) ran the bases and took batting practice. But there was no word on a timeline for a potential rehab assignment. ... 3B-OF Cavan Biggio (sprained spine ligament) went 0 for 2 with a walk during a rehab game with Triple-A Buffalo. Depending on how Biggio feels, Montoyo said there's a good chance he will rejoin the Blue Jays this weekend in Boston.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays: RHP Ross Stripling (2-3, 4.71 ERA) faces Red Sox RHP Garrett Richards (4-4, 3.88 ERA) on Friday night in the opener of a four-game series at Fenway Park. Stripling is going for his third straight win.	White Sox: RHP Lucas Giolito (5-5, 3.88 ERA) starts Friday night in the opener of a three-game series at Detroit. Giolito is 0-2 with a 5.27 ERA in two starts against the Tigers this year. LHP Tarik Skubal (3-7, 4.33 ERA) takes the mound for Detroit.	------	Jay Cohen can be reached at https://twitter.com/jcohenap	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

MINNEAPOLIS -- — Josh Donaldson and Nelson Cruz hit two-run homers off Aroldis Chapman in the ninth inning, and the Minnesota Twins beat the New York Yankees 7-5 Thursday night to avoid a three-game sweep.	“Pretty amazing effort by our guys, and those at-bats in the last inning were pretty spectacular,” said Twins manager Rocco Baldelli.	Giancarlo Stanton drove a slider off the end of his bat 422 feet for a three-run, first-inning homer off J.A. Happ, Gio Urshela also homered and an all right-handed New York Yankees lineup built a 5-2 lead by the sixth inning.	But Chapman blew a save for the second time in 14 chances. He threw just five of nine pitches for strikes and his velocity was down from his usual 99-100 mph as he allowed all four batters to reach.	“He started out with a couple sliders, clearly missed his spots on a couple,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said of Chapman. “A lot of times when he has those outings, usually he’ll find the velocity within the course of the outing.”	Jorge Polanco singled on a 3-1 pitch leading off the ninth, and Donaldson hit a 438-foot homer on a 95.5 mph pitch with a 1-0 count. Willians Astudillo singled on the first pitch, and Cruz hit one 457 feet on the next offering, a 97.8 mph fastball. The homers by Donaldson and Cruz were the longest allowed by Chapman since at least 2015.	“He’s the best closer in the game, so it was remarkable to be able to score four runs against him," Cruz said.	This was just the third time Chapman allowed multiple homers in a game, after Minnesota’s Eduardo Escobar and Kurt Suzuki on June 18, 2016, and Philadelphia’s Erik Kratz and Freddy Galvis on May 19, 2013, according to MLB. Cruz had the 14th walk-off hit of his big league career.	“Probably the last couple outings I’ve been a little passive, especially the first couple hitters of the inning,” Chapman said through a translator.	Happ, wearing a beard in his post-Yankees career, gave up four runs and eight hits in five innings. He was displeased about being phased out of the Yankees’ rotation down the stretch last year, then signed with the Twins as a free agent.	Stanton hit his 12th homer this season and third in two games.	Yankees starter Michael King allowed two runs and four hits in 3 2/3 innings, remaining winless in three starts since replacing injured Corey Kluber in the rotation.	“I felt like I nibbled a little bit in that first inning,” King said. “I started kind of getting into a groove in that second, third inning.”	New York's Chris Gittens was initially credited with a two-run homer in the fourth for his first big league hit on an-opposite-field drive down the right-field line, but the fair call by first base umpire Tripp Gibson was reversed by Hunter Wendelstedt, a decision confirmed by video review.	Aaron Judge moved over from right and made his third start of the season in center for the Yankees.	The short-handed Twins (24-38) started three rookie outfielders and lost another outfielder when Alex Kirilloff sustained a low-grade left ankle sprain in the first inning. Nick Gordon replaced Kirilloff and took over in center field.	Gordon had previously played just one career inning in center in his professional career.	STANTON TO BENCH	Stanton will be limited to a bench role this weekend in Philadelphia, when there is no DH.	“I don’t plan on using him in the outfield yet,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. “But it is something that as the summer unfolds and hopefully I’m still very open to having that being in play.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Yankees: LHP Zack Britton (March 15 surgery to remove a bone spur in left elbow) walked one in a hitless inning for Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre in his fifth rehab appearance and could be activated this weekend in Philadelphia. ... 1B Luke Voit (right oblique strain) could start an injury rehab assignment Sunday or Tuesday, putting him on track to be activated June 22. ... RHP Luis Severino (Tommy John surgery on Feb. 27, 2020) is to make his second minor league injury rehabiliation start Saturday, throwing about three innings and 40 pitches. Boone said Severino could be called up before is ready to throw 80-90 pitches in an outing.	Twins: CF Byron Buxton (right hip strain) hit a pair of two-run homers Thursday in his rehab start with Triple-A St. Paul. ... The Twins are still deciding if right-hander Kenta Maeda (right adductor strain) will make another rehab start. Baldelli said it’s “very possible” Maeda’s next start will be in the majors.	UP NEXT	Yankees: New York has a rare Friday off before a two-game series at Philadelphia beginning Saturday. RHP Jameson Taillon (1-4, 5.09 ERA) gets the start for the Yankees in the series opener.	Twins: RHP Matt Shoemaker (2-7, 7.28 ERA) takes to the mound Friday for the first game of Minnesota’s series against Houston at Target Field. Shoemaker allowed nine runs (eight earned) and recorded just one out in his most recent start.	------	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- — Mike Minor likes pitching in close games, and that's exactly what he faced dueling against Frankie Montas for much of his outing Thursday night until Kansas City's hitters delivered late.	Manager Mike Matheny has stressed how the Royals must grind through entire games, not just at-bats, to get winning results — and that's what they needed to finally get to Montas.	Jorge Soler and Andrew Benintendi homered to help back Minor, and Kansas City snapped a five-game losing streak by beating the Oakland Athletics 6-1 on Thursday night.	“We talk about grinding at-bats, but you also have games that you grind,” said Matheny, a former Giants catcher happy to be staying back in San Francisco this weekend. “You just kind of stay with it. We had a couple hard outs. ... We had to just try and stay the course until we could find that big hit.”	Montas (6-6) retired 13 straight during one stretch and stayed crisp into the seventh with eight strikeouts and no walks. He was tagged for three runs — two earned — on five hits over 6 1/3 innings. Montas was hurt by a catcher's interference with one out in the seventh that went to review on a Royals challenge they won on an overturn.	A's manager Bob Melvin considered it “bad luck” given how well Montas threw late into his outing.	“When you don’t have a whole lot going on offensively, unlucky stuff like that can beat you,” Melvin said, noting “that was probably some of his best velocity of the year.”	Minor (5-3) struck out eight and walked one while allowing three hits and one earned run over seven strong innings.	His offense came through late.	“Frankie has dominant stuff so we were just trying to do whatever we could,” Minor said. “Honestly I thought he was going to keep on going until the bullpen took over. Guys stayed patient, stayed on it.”	Hunter Dozier hit a tying double in the seventh then Kelvin Gutiérrez followed with a go-ahead, two-run single.	Soler connected for a two-run homer in the eighth and Benintendi added a solo shot that inning as key contributors to an important Royals win after they were outscored 22-5 in a three-game road sweep by the Angels.	Jed Lowrie homered leading off the fourth, but that was it for Oakland, which has struggled recently clearing the fences at home with regular windy conditions and Lowrie joked of his drive: “Better aim I guess. The Coliseum, you never know what you’re going to get.”	“Matt Olson hit a ball 109 mph yesterday at 31 degrees, which is a homer anywhere, anytime, and it barely made it to the warning track,” Melvin said before the game. “That can be frustrating at times for these guys."	The A's dropped to 9-2 against the AL Central this season.	Montas had been 2-0 with a 1.62 ERA over his first three career outings against the Royals.	“It’s the best I’ve looked so far,” Montas said. "I feel like I had everything working today."	TOUGH OPPONENT	The Royals are just 5-10 with four series defeats to the A's since the club's last winning set — taking two of three versus Oakland from Aug. 14-16, 2017. But since a 19-4 loss on Aug. 26, 2019, the last six meetings had been decided by two or fewer runs and four straight one-run games before Thursday's result.	The teams hadn't played since Sept. 18, 2019.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Royals: SS Adalberto Mondesí, on the IL with a strained left hamstring, continues his baseball activities as he works back from the injury. ... LHP Danny Duffy (left forearm flexor strain) threw a side session.	Athletics: CF Ramón Laureano, working back from a strained right hip that landed him on the IL, hit live batting practice on the field for the first time and said the hip isn't affected at the plate but rather when on his feet playing defense. He expects he might need a rehab assignment not as much for his hitting but “more playing seven innings” in center field. He is doing some running and hopes soon to progress to running bases. “That's the goal,” he said. ... RHP J.B. Wendelken (strained left oblique) is set to throw a 30-pitch bullpen session Friday. ... Closer Trevor Rosenthal, sidelined by inflammation in his pitching shoulder, is still working through an aggressive strengthening program. “He hasn’t started playing catch yet, we're probably still a little bit away from that,” Melvin said. “Everything that he's doing right now, we’re still hopeful at some point in time we have him this year.”	UP NEXT	RHP Brady Singer (3-5, 4.88 ERA) pitches for Kansas City in the second matchup of the four-game set Friday night looking to avoid dropping consecutive starts for the first time since his initial two outings of 2021. Oakland counters with LHP Cole Irvin (4-7, 3.89), who snapped a four-game losing streak his last time out by beating Colorado on Saturday.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO -- — Anthony Rizzo could feel the fans hanging onto each pitch as he fouled off one after another.	When he finally launched one over the right-field wall on the 14th pitch of his at-bat, Wrigley Field rocked in a way it hadn't in years, with a near-capacity crowd on its feet and roaring.	“It was incredible,” Rizzo said.	Joc Pederson homered and drove in three runs, Rizzo and Willson Contreras went deep and the Chicago Cubs beat the St. Louis Cardinals 8-5 on Friday.	Wrigley Field allowed 100% capacity for the first time since 2019 on what the Cubs called “Opening Day 2.0.” They fell behind 5-1, then treated a crowd of 35,112 to a comeback win over their NL Central rivals.	Pederson gave the Cubs a 7-5 lead in the seventh with a two-run double off the wall in right-center against Génesis Cabrera (1-2). He also singled leading off the first and homered in his second straight game when he drove one to the center-field basket against against Johan Oviedo in the fourth.	Rizzo tied it at 5-all in the sixth with his drive  to right against Daniel Ponce de Leon. It came on the longest Cubs at-bat to end in with a home run since pitch count records began in 1988, and the fans erupted in delight.	He took a ball on an 0-2 pitch, then fouled off six more. He took another ball and fouled off three more before connecting on a 96.1 mph fastball.	For Rizzo it was as sweet as any hit since he arrived in Chicago in 2012.	“It was definitely one of my most memorable at-bats,” he said. “With it being 100% today for the first time and having everyone here, versus the Cardinals, it was a really good moment for me.”	Contreras added a solo homer in the eighth.	Kohl Stewart got chased during a three-run fifth. But the Cubs scored three in the bottom half, knocking Oviedo out and pulling to 5-4.	Stewart gave up five runs and six hits in four-plus innings. Four relievers combined to shut down the Cardinals.	Tommy Nance (1-0) threw two innings to win his first major league decision. Ryan Tepera worked the eighth, and Craig Kimbrel retired all three batters in the ninth for his 16th save in 18 chances.	“It just felt really energetic,” manager David Ross said. “The outfield was packed, beautiful day. That was a nice W. ... Clearly, those fans helped us win that game.”	LOSSES MOUNTING	The Cardinals lost for the seventh time in eight games and have fallen from first place before play to May 31 to a 32-31 record.	“Better times are ahead,” Nolan Arenado said. “I've said that before, but I really believe that. If we can get healthier and get everyone back full strength, we'll be right there.”	Arenado drove in three runs. Yadier Molina had three hits, but the nine-time Gold Glove catcher also allowed runs to score on a passed ball and throwing error in the fifth.	Oviedo allowed four runs and five hits in 4 1/3 innings.	NO VACCINE	Rizzo created a stir before the game when he told a Chicago radio station he has not been vaccinated.	He called it a “really hard decision on both ends” in an interview with WMVP-AM and basically reiterated that in his postgame media session, though he didn't completely slam the door on getting one of the vaccines.	“For me, it's just one of those things where I'm definitely not against getting it,” said Rizzo, a cancer survivor. “Just taking some more time to see the data on all of it. There's definitely some personal reasons as well. ... I love that everyone gets vaccinated. I'm for it. I think it's really amazing to see everyone back in the stands and back getting to normal.”	The Cubs are not among the 22 teams reaching the 85% vaccination threshold that would allow them to relax protocols. Teams that get there can drop the requirements for facemasks in dugouts and bullpens, and loosen restrictions on mobility during road trips.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: SS Paul DeJong (non-displaced rib fracture) returned to the lineup after being sidelined since May 12. ... The Cardinals were hopeful LHP Kwang Hyun Kim (lower back tightness) won't need to go on a rehab assignment before returning from the injured list, manager Mike Shildt said. ... RHP Kodi Whitley (back) has resumed playing catch and could throw off the mound in the next three to five days, Shildt said.	Cubs: SS Javier Báez (sore right thumb) returned to the lineup after missing the previous three games. ... The Cubs placed C P.J. Higgins (strained right forearm) on the 10-day injured list and selected C José Lobatón from Triple-A Iowa. They also designated RHP Dakota Chalmers for assignment.	UP NEXT	RHP Kyle Hendricks (7-4, 4.59 ERA) looks to win his sixth straight start for Chicago, while RHP John Gant (4-3, 2.63) pitches for St. Louis. Hendricks has a 2.91 ERA in his past five outings.	----	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

WASHINGTON -- — Washington ace Max Scherzer left after just 12 pitches with a groin injury, Buster Posey homered and the San Francisco Giants beat the Nationals 1-0 on Friday night on Anthony DeSclafani’s career-best two-hitter.	A crowd of 18,029 attended the first game at Nationals Park without capacity limits since the 2019 World Series.	Scherzer, a 36-year-old right-hander with three Cy Young Awards, retired leadoff batter LaMonte Wade Jr. on a fly ball to left and had a 3-2 count on Brandon Belt when he stretched his body, and manager Dave Martinez and director of athletic training Paul Lessard went to the mound.	Scherzer took one warmup toss before exiting. Scherzer is 5-4 with a 2.21 ERA and began the night second in the NL with 104 strikeouts.	“All of a sudden I felt my groin tweak me,” Scherzer said.	“The good news is that it is not a muscle strain. I am really day-to-day. I am very confident this will be very mild.”	Scherzer said an MRI showed only inflammation.	“It was a lot better news than I thought,” Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. “We’re still not out of the woods. We’ll see how he feels tomorrow.”	DeSclafani (6-2) struck out eight and walked one in his third career shutout and complete game. He pitched a four-hitter for Cincinnati at Arizona in August 2016 and a three-hitter against Colorado this April 26.	San Francisco pitched its major league-leading ninth shutout. The Nationals have been blanked eight times.	Mike Tauchman leaped at the left field wall to rob Juan Soto in the seventh.	“That was insane — huge catch,” DeSclafani said. “If you don’t make that it’s a tie ballgame and I probably don’t go nine.”	On May 28 at Dodger Stadium, Tauchman took away what would have been a game-winning home by Albert Pujols in the ninth inning, and the Giants went on to beat Los Angeles in the 10th.	DeSclafani retired his first nine batters before Trea Turner singled leading off the fourth. Josh Bell doubled with two outs in the seventh off DeSclafani, who faced only one more than the minimum 27 batters. DeSclafani has allowed three earned runs or fewer in 16 consecutive road starts.	Posey homered in the fourth, driving a slider from Paolo Espino (0-2) into the Giants bullpen in left for his 11th homer this season.	Posey, who opted out of the 2020 season during the pandemic, already has more homers than he did in both 2018 and 2019. His career high is 24 homers which he set in 2012 when he was voted MVP.	Espino, who entered on short notice after the Scherzer injury, struck out five in 3 1/3 innings while allowing one run on three hits. Five Nationals relievers combined to allow four hits and retired their final 16 batters.	“What stands out to me was how well the Nationals bullpen and Davey navigated that game without Scherzer,” Giants manager Gabe Kapler said. "Obviously, you never want to see anyone get hurt on the mound.”	BIG CATCH	“It’s crazy,” Tauchman said of his catch. “The opportunities are few and far between for those. Any time the fence is involved there’s a certain level of difficulty. At that point it was an important play in the grand scheme of the game.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Giants: Kapler said C Curt Casali (left wrist strain) and OF Mike Yastrzemski (right thumb sprain) should both be reinstated from the 10-day injured list on Saturday. ... 1B Darin Ruf (right hamstring strain) could return as soon as the Diamondbacks series that begins on Monday. ... LHP Caleb Baragar (left elbow inflammation) was reinstated from the 10-day injured list.	Nationals: RHP Stephen Strasburg (neck) came in for a workout Friday and left before the game started. “It’s frustrating for him, I know,” Martinez said about Strasburg, who has only pitched 21 2/3 innings over five games this season. ... RHP Austin Voth (nose fracture) has seen the swelling in his eye go down, according to Martinez. Voth was able to ride a bike and throw a baseball from a short distance.	UP NEXT	Giants RHP Kevin Gausman (7-0, 1.27 ERA) is unbeaten in 12 starts and takes an NL-best 1.27 ERA into Saturday, when is expected to start a doubleheader opener against Erick Fedde (4.35), who has been on the COVID-19 injured list since May 19.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- — Ryan Yarbrough followed up a rare Tampa Bay complete game with six solid innings and the Rays became the first team to reach 40 wins this season, 4-2 over the Baltimore Orioles on Friday night.	“Hopefully we're first to 41, too,” Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash said.	Yarbrough (4-3), the first Rays’ pitcher to go the distance in five years in his previous start, gave up two unearned runs and three hits.	Brandon Lowe homered for the Rays, who are 21-5 since May 13.	Baltimore got a home run from Trey Mancini.	The Orioles have lost 13 in a row on the road. It is tied for the longest skid since the team moved to Baltimore from St. Lois in 1954.	Yarbrough struck out six. His complete game on June 3 at the New York Yankees was Tampa Bay’s first since Matt Andriese on May 14, 2016, against Oakland and stopped a major league record of 731 games without one, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.	Yarbrough also has won consecutive starts after ending a 24-game winless streak as a starter in the game against the Yankees. Often used following an opener, he is 25-5 as a reliever.	“I just think it's from getting into a good groove,” Yarbrough said. “I feel like early in the year it was always something in my first inning, whether it was starting or coming after guys. Something would always happen, so kind of being able to get into a rhythm beginning of the game has been huge."	It was Yarbrough's first home win as starter since June 11, 2018 over Toronto.	Lowe, who entered with the second-lowest average in the AL at .188, had been hitless in 16 at-bats before putting the Rays ahead 3-2 with a two-run homer in the fourth off Keegan Akin (0-1).	“It felt great,” Lowe said. “Hitting the ball out of the ballpark wasn't the idea. Guy on third base, less than one out and the infield was in, anything I could do to get an RBI. Happy that it went out, for sure though.”	It was Lowe’s fifth hit, including three homers, in 65 at-bats against left-hander’s this year.	Andrew Kittredge, J.P. Feyereisen and Pete Fairbanks, who worked the ninth to get his second save, completed a three-hitter.	“They have a lot of different angles they can throw at you,” Baltimore manager Brandon Hyde said.	Mancini hit a two-run drive off Yarbrough in the third. It was his third homer in 19 at-bats against the lefty in a matchup of players that went to high school in nearby Winter Haven, Florida.	Mancini has four homers and nine RBI in four games against the Rays this season.	Manuel Margot cut the Tampa Bay deficit to 2-1 on a third-inning fielder’s choice and made it 4-2 on an RBI single in the seventh.	Akin allowed three runs, five hits and three walks in four innings during a 95-pitch outing.	Orioles rookie Ryan Mountcastle had his streak of driving in at least one run in eight straight games end.	HARVEY STAYING PUT	Hyde reiterated that struggling Matt Harvey will make his next scheduled start and get the chance to “try and fight through these tough times.” The right-hander has allowed 36 runs and eight homers over 23 2/3 innings in his past seven starts. The pair talked before the game. “He’s been working hard,” Hyde said. “I know he’s very discouraged, disappointed, frustrated.”	DEALING	The Rays acquired RHP Matt Wisler and cash from San Francisco for minor league LHP Michael Plassmeyer.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Orioles: OF Austin Hays (strained left hamstring) returned from the 10-day IL and went 0 for 4, including three strikeouts.	Rays: 1B Ji-Man Choi (left groin strain) got eight at-bats at extended spring training.	UP NEXT	Baltimore RHP Jorge López (2-6) and Rays LHP Rich Hill (5-2) are Saturday’s starters. Hill is 4-1 with an 0.68 ERA in seven starts since May 1.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DETROIT -- — Liam Hendriks angrily threw a wet ball into foul territory after his first pitch of the ninth inning, leading to a lengthy rain delay, then gave up a tying two-run homer to Daz Cameron before the Chicago White Sox beat the Detroit Tigers 5-4 in 10 innings on Friday night.	Chicago led 4-2 when Hendriks entered to start the ninth, seeking his AL-high 17th save.	The All-Star closer threw a ball on his first pitch to Miguel Cabrera, and when Hendriks got a new ball back, he went to the stretch then threw the ball into foul territory on the third-base side on a hop and yelled toward plate umpire Chris Conroy “It's all wet!” as he spread both arms wide.	“I slipped on my warmup pitches, and every ball the umpire gave me was wet,” Hendriks said. “It was raining so hard the umpire's bag was wet, so there was no way I could get a dry ball. That's just not safe for anyone.”	As White Sox manager Tony La Russa started to head to the plate, umpires called for a delay, and Hendriks spoke with the umpires as he walked to the dugout.	“They asked me if I was OK with keeping the game going, and I said it was fine,” La Russa said. “But then it all came down in a hurry.”	The game resumed 49 minutes later, with Hendriks fussing over the rosin bag.	Cabrera swung and missed Hendriks’s first pitch, then singled to right. After Eric Haase popped out, Cameron drove the next pitch, a fastball, to right-center for his home run in 62 career big-league at-bats.	“That had nothing at all to do with the delay,” Hendriks said. “I've never seen him, so I wanted to throw a fastball to get a look at his swing and he hit it out. He's a strong kid.”	Cameron's father, Mike, was a three-time Gold Glove outfielder during 17 major league seasons including four with the White Sox. He was the second hitter in the first game at Comerica Park in 2000 and was an All-Star in 2001.	Daz Cameron, 23, made his big league debut last September.	“Dad might get the ball eventually, but I'm sleeping with it tonight,” Daz Cameron said after getting the ball back from a fan in exchange for an autographed ball.	.Hendriks (3-1) had entered with 14 straight scoreless appearances and had retired 26 of his previous 28 batters.	“That's one of the best closers in the game, so you don't need to go up there and try to generate power,” Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said. “He's going to provide the power, so I was proud of Daz for not going up there and overswinging.”	Yoan Moncada hit a sacrifice fly in the 10th off José Cisnero (0-4), sending Danny Mendick across the plate with a headfirst slide as he got his left hand in ahead of Jake Rogers' tag.	“In extra innings, you've got to go in that situation,” Mendick said. “I knew it was going to be close, but the throw was just up the line and I got in.”	Adam Engel homered in the second, but Nomar Mazara's homer tied the score in the bottom half.	Isaac Paredes hit his first homer for the Tigers.	A LOT OF EXPERIENCE	La Russa first managed the White Sox against the Tigers on June 13, 1980. Detroit, managed by Hall of Famer Sparky Anderson, won 8-4. Hinch was 6 years old.	CRAZY SCORING	There were a pair of plays with unusual notations on the scorecard. In the top of the second, Mendick was thrown out stealing second with the catcher making the tag. Tigers pitcher Tarik Skubal picked him off first and he took off for second before being retired in a rundown with Rogers catching him between first and second.	Seven Tigers ended up touching the ball on Rogers' error in the seventh, as Mazara fielded the ball in right, threw Cabrera at first, who started a rundown that included the other three infielders and Skubal before second baseman Jonathan Schoop made the tag.	UP NEXT	The teams play the second game of their series on Saturday, with Detroit's José Ureña (2-5, 4.25) facing Dylan Cease (4-2, 3.36).	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CINCINNATI -- — The Reds hit five homers over the first five innings, including a three-run blast by Joey Votto, and Cincinnati extended the Colorado Rockies' road woes with an 11-5 win on Friday night.	Nick Castellanos, Scott Heineman, Kyle Farmer and Tyler Stephenson also went deep against Kyle Freeland (0-2), who set a career high for home runs allowed.	The Rockies fell to 5-25 away from Coors Field and have lost every road series this season.	The Reds fell one short of matching their single-game season high for homers. They homered in five consecutive innings for the first time since April 21, 2015, at Milwaukee. Cincinnati had never hit homers in the first five innings of any game since rejoining the National League in 1890, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.	Tyler Mahle (6-2) had a 9-0 lead before he faltered in the sixth, allowing a run on a wild pitch before Ryan McMahon hit a three-run homer. Mahle allowed four runs on five hits in six innings, retiring 12 straight batters in one stretch.	“It’s awesome," Mahle said. "When your team's hitting like that, you can just try to get outs. They put on a clinic.”	With Jesse Winker on first, Castellanos lined Freeland’s fifth pitch of the game into the first row of seats in deep right-center for his 13th homer of the season.	Eugenio Suárez led off the second with a double, and Heineman followed with his second homer of the year. Votto broke the game open in the third with his seventh homer, an opposite-field shot that followed third baseman McMahon's error on a potential double-play ball. The normally laid-back Votto celebrated a bit when he saw the ball reach the seats.	“We went ahead 7-0," he said. "The more runs the merrier. I just wanted to contribute to the win. I’m feeling more comfortable celebrating. That was genuine joy. That was relief.”	“It’s the best to see guys have success," Reds manager David Bell said. "I know Joey’s had a lot of it, but it is still good to see him enjoy it.”	Farmer homered leading off the fourth and Stephenson ended Freeland's night when he went deep leading off the fifth. Freeland previously had allowed three home runs in a game three times. He gave up nine runs (eight earned) on eight hits in his fourth start since coming off the injured list.	“My body feels fine,” he said. “I'm just missing locations.”	The Rockies had seven hits. They are batting a major league-worst .202 as visitors, while their home average of .277 leads the majors.	PROFESSIONAL RESPECT	Colorado second baseman Brendan Rodgers’s diving backhand stop of Jesse Winker’s sharp one-hopper prompted Winker to point at Rodgers in a gesture of admiration.	ALL OR NOTHING	Heineman’s homer was his second hit since being promoted on May 21. Both are home runs.	GOLD MINE	The Reds improved to 4-1 in Mahle’s five career starts against Colorado, but he is just 1-1 in those games.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Reds: Placed RHP Tejay Antone on the 10-day injured list, retroactive to Tuesday, with right forearm inflammation.	UP NEXT	Rockies: RHP Germán Márquez (4-5, 3.91 ERA) is 3-0 with a 3.15 ERA in three career starts against Cincinnati.	Reds: LHP Wade Miley (5-4, 2.96) was roughed up for 11 hits and eight runs in three innings at Colorado on May 14.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

NEW YORK -- — Jacob deGrom did it all Friday night, pitching and hitting the Mets to victory.	New York manager Luis Rojas even trusts him to diagnose his own elbow injury — and Dr. deGrom says not to fret.	“My level of concern is not too high,” deGrom said.	The two-time NL Cy Young Award winner faced the minimum over six innings and ripped a two-run single before leaving with right flexor tendinitis that clouded New York's 3-2 victory over the San Diego Padres on Friday night.	DeGrom was pulled after 80 pitches and extending his scoreless streak to 22 innings.	The right-hander said he felt discomfort in his elbow this week but wasn't worried by it. He tore the ligament in his pitching elbow as a minor leaguer and needed Tommy John surgery in 2010, and he said “this didn’t feel anything like that.”	The elbow began to tighten up in the sixth inning, leading to the decision to pull deGrom. He underwent several tests to ensure the ligament was intact — something the 32-year-old does regularly — but those tests did not include any imaging.	“Whenever you say elbow anything for a pitcher, everyone gets nervous about that,” deGrom said. “But like I said, I do a lot of ligament tests on my own, and doing those, knowing what those feel like, it’s a totally different spot.”	DeGrom doesn't plan to seek an MRI or other imaging, and he expects to proceed with his normal between-start routine and pitch next time his rotation spot comes up.	Rojas is on board with that plan.	"I’m not concerned either, just because Jake is not," Rojas said. “This is a guy who knows his body really well, knows his arm really well.”	The injury spoiled a memorable two-way performance by deGrom, who has has five RBI this season — compared to four earned runs allowed.	The two-time NL Cy Young Award winner’s 0.56 ERA is the lowest ever by a pitcher through 10 starts, just ahead of Juan Marichal’s 0.59 in 1966.	Facing San Diego and star slugger Fernando Tatis Jr. for the second time in six days, deGrom was perfect until Wil Myers beat the shift with a weak grounder in the fifth. Myers was caught stealing by catcher James McCann a few pitches later.	DeGrom thought he had a shot at a perfect game after four innings.	“Definitely the thought creeped into my mind," he said. “Throwing a no-hitter or a perfect game has definitely been a goal, just haven’t been able to do it.”	Myers was the only runner to reach against deGrom, who struck out 10 despite the abbreviated outing. New York has been limiting his workload since an injured list stint in May with right side tightness.	Billy McKinney drove in a run with the first of his two doubles in the fifth, and deGrom followed with his two-run hit.	DeGrom won a third straight start in the same season for the first time since August 2018.	“He's plus stuff, plus command,” Padres manager Jayce Tingler said. “He's as tough as they come.”	San Diego dropped its third straight. Blake Snell (2-3) allowed three runs in four-plus innings, and the Padres couldn't do enough damage against New York's bullpen.	Right-hander Miguel Castro replaced deGrom for the seventh and allowed a double by Tatis and a two-run homer by Jake Cronenworth before exiting with neck stiffness.	Aaron Loup took the mound in the eighth but left with two outs after being hit in the arm by a comebacker.	Closer Edwin Díaz got the last out and three more in the ninth — including Tatis' third strikeout of the game — for his 11th save. New York moved seven games over .500 for the first time tis season.	In the fifth, the left-hitting deGrom faked a bunt and nearly swung out of his shoes on Snell's first offering with runners at first and second and no outs, but he missed. Snell balked before the next pitch, advancing McKinney and José Peraza. That allowed them to score easily when deGrom laced a single toward left-center field.	That was the final pitch for Snell, who said he lost command of his fastball in the fourth and fifth innings Friday.	“I feel really good,” he said. “Just lost my fastball the last two innings, and yeah, if I don't, it's a completely different game.”	The Mets increased capacity with virus protocols easing, and roughly 26,637 came to Queens ready to cheer for their ace. They chanted “MVP” throughout — loudest after his fifth-inning hit.	He got his 100th strikeout when Tatis went down swinging in the fourth, reaching the mark in 61 2/3 innings — the fewest innings to reach 100 punchouts in a season since the mound was moved to 60 feet, six inches in 1893, per ESPN.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: CF Trent Grisham (left heel bruise) played his second rehab game with Triple-A El Paso. Manager Jayce Tingler said Grisham is likely to rejoin the club during a series early next weekin Colorado but could be back as soon as Sunday for the series finale against New York. ... Left-hander Joe Beimel signed a minor league deal with San Diego. The 44-year-old hasn't pitched in the majors since 2015.	Mets: RHP Carlos Carrasco had a PRP injection on his injured right hamstring after struggling to regain strength in the muscle. He'll be shut down for a week, but acting general manager Zack Scott is still hopeful he can return some time in July. ... 2B Jeff McNeil (hamstring) could begin a rehab assignment Sunday. ... INF Luis Guillorme (oblique) was activated from the IL and INF Travis Blankenhorn was optioned to Triple-A. Guillorme grounded out as a pinch-hitter in the seventh.

CLEVELAND -- — Aaron Civale felt miserable the past few days, suffering with allergy symptoms. The Mariners didn't cause him any problems at all.	Civale gave up a single to start the game before dominating Seattle's light-hitting lineup for eight innings, leading the Cleveland Indians past the Mariners 7-0 on Friday night in front of the largest crowd at Progressive Field since 2019.	Civale (9-2) allowed J.P. Crawford's leadoff hit — a grounder that just got past second baseman César Hernández's glove — and nothing else to become the first AL pitcher with nine wins. The right-hander, who turns 26 on Saturday, struck out a career-high 11 and retired 22 in a row after loading the bases in the first.	Afterward, Civale said he hasn't pitched much better, but he has certainly felt better.	“I’m kind of under the weather the last few days,” he said. "Some allergies going on. But I’ve thrown some of my best games when I haven’t been feeling my best, physically. I think the focus tonight was probably the best I’ve had in a long time.	"That’s something I try to carry into each and every start.”	The Mariners, who have been on the wrong side of two no-hitters this season, came into the series batting an MLB-worst .209. Civale made them look foolish with a nasty curveball that locked up hitters.	“We knew that was his pitch,” Mariners manager Scott Servais said. “We just couldn't do anything about it.”	Cleveland's Bobby Bradley homered in the third off Justin Dunn (1-3) and Amed Rosario had four hits for the Indians.	The series opener was the first game in which capacity attendance was allowed at Progressive Field since before the COVID-19 pandemic, and 22,970 fans came out for the Mariners, $1 hot dogs and fireworks on “Opening Day 2.0.”	Civale and the Indians didn't disappoint their fans, who still aren't sure what to make of this young team that can look lost offensively and relies so heavily on its pitching.	Cleveland has hit plenty enough for Civale, who improved to 15-0 when his teammates score at least three runs.	The crowd was festive, breaking into the wave and cheering every strikeout by Civale.	“The energy was awesome, so that’s something that I felt on the mound several times,” Civale said. "There were several instances on the mound where I just kind of used that as extra adrenaline and that’s something that’s been missing from this game the past few years.	"It’s really nice to have that back. Just have awesome fans here. That’s what we play for.”	The Indians pounced on Dunn right away, scoring three times in the first.	Eddie Rosario had an RBI single, Dunn walked Bradley with the bases full to force in a run and Josh Naylor made it 3-0 with a single. The Indians could have done more to Dunn, but Rosario was thrown out at the plate by center fielder Dillon Thomas.	José Ramírez's run-scoring single put Cleveland up 4-0 in the second.	BIG BAT	Bradley, who was recalled from the minors last week, continued his hot start by connecting for his second homer in 11 at-bats. He later added an RBI single and is batting .462 (6 for 13) with six RBI in six games since being called up.	“All those starry-eyed moments are gone,” he said. “I see myself as one of these big leaguers now. It’s not like, ‘Oh my God, this is my first time’ anymore. It’s just, ‘Now it’s time to put my head down and work.’”	Bradley didn't make the opening day roster despite outplaying Jake Bauers, who was designated for assignment by the club last week and traded to Seattle on Thursday.	Quickly back in Cleveland, Bauers went 0 for 3.	SCARY MOMENT	Indians catcher Austin Hedges was drilled in the helmet by Dunn in the third.	Hedges collapsed to the ground and stayed on his back in the dirt for nearly two minutes while being checked by manager Terry Francona and a trainer. Hedges stayed in the game before being replaced in the fifth as a precaution.	“He’s passed all the tests,” Francona said. "We’ll certainly monitor him through the night and when he comes in, but so far we think he’s OK.”	MARINERS MANEUVERS	Seattle got back its top reliever as Kendall Graveman was activated after a COVID-19 scare.	The right-hander had been out since May 23, and spent two weeks quarantining in San Diego. Before he was sidelined, the 30-year-old recorded five saves and didn't not allow a run in 16 2/3 innings over 14 appearances.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: Due in part to injuries, Seattle has used an MLB-high 51 players already this season.	Indians: RHP Zach Plesac began throwing this week as he recovers from a broken thumb, suffered when he angrily pulled off his shirt following a start. Francona said Plesac has been attacking his rehab as the club expected. “Knowing Zach, probably have to help him pump the brakes a little bit," he said.	UP NEXT	Indians RHP Triston McKenzie (1-3), who has bounced back and forth from the minors, will be recalled from Columbus to start against Seattle's Yusei Kikuchi (3-3).	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BOSTON -- — Red Sox manager Alex Cora doesn’t expect people to forget about the guy they gave up for Alex Verdugo.	He just wants the Boston fans to appreciate the player they got when Mookie Betts was traded to the Dodgers.	“We believe in this guy,” Cora said after Verdugo banged a walkoff single off the Green Monster to help the Red Sox rally from a four-run deficit and beat the Toronto Blue Jays 6-5 on Friday night. “We got a good one."	Verdugo had three hits to lead the Red Sox to their major league-best 23rd comeback victory of the season. The 25-year-old outfielder was acquired last spring for Betts, the 2018 AL MVP who went on to lead the Dodgers to the World Series title.	“I know everybody’s going to talk about that trade -- forever, I guess," Cora said. "But he’s a good player. And he’s young, and he understands what he needs to do to prepare on a daily basis. His at-bats are amazing.”	Vladimir Guerrero Jr. had three of Toronto’s 16 hits, including his major league-leading 19th homer of the season, as the Blue Jays opened a 5-1 lead in the sixth inning. But the Red Sox scored three in the bottom half and tied it on Christian Arroyo’s towering solo home run onto Lansdowne Street in the eighth.	Toronto loaded the bases in the ninth as rain began to fall — keeping the inning going when first baseman Bobby Dalbec misplayed a foul popup with two outs. But Riley Adams hit a grounder in the hole and shortstop Marwin Gonzalez barely got the force at second.	Kiké Hernández led off the bottom half with a grounder and the throw from shortstop Bo Bichette pulled first baseman Rowdy Tellez off the bag. Tellez tried to put the tag on the runner, but the ball popped out of his glove and rolled away, allowing Hernandez to take second.	“Kiké was busting down the line, forced a throw. Next thing you know he’s at second, in scoring position,” Arroyo said. “A hard 90 down to first base, making something happen. Good things happen when you put the ball in play."	Verdugo lined one off the left-field wall, and pinch-runner Danny Santana scored easily.	“The game was obviously crazy, being down big at first and then chipping away,” Verdugo said. "When you're at the box, you try your best to calm down, take deep breaths, relax, whatever. But when you have 25,000-30,000 people screaming and yelling and jumping up and down, it’s a little hard to get that tunnel vision.	“But at the same time it’s amazing. Your heart starts racing, everything feels good. What was sore before isn't sore at that moment. You're just kind of locked in,” he said. “It was very special, very fun.”	Dalbec also homered for Boston. Garrett Whitlock (2-1) pitched two scoreless innings, allowing two hits and a walk while striking out three.	Rafael Dolis (1-2) pitched the ninth for Toronto.	Guerrero smacked a single and a double off the Green Monster before hitting a home run over it -- a 443-foot shot off the DraftKings billboard above the wall in left-center that made it 5-1. With a chance to complete the cycle in the eighth, he struck out looking.	Randal Grichuk also had three hits for the Blue Jays, who have lost four of their last five games.	Guerrero singled in the first, when the Blue Jays had three hits and a walk but managed only one run. He walked in the second, when they added three more hits to make it 3-0. He was stranded on second after his fourth-inning double.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Blue Jays: Activated 3B Cavan Biggio (neck sprain) from the injured list. He had not played since May 21. Santiago Espinal was optioned to Triple-A to make room.	Red Sox: SS Xander Bogaerts was a late scratch from the lineup because his knee was sore after diving for an Alex Bregman base hit up the middle on Thursday night. The team hopes to have him back by Sunday.	UP NEXT	LHP Steven Matz (6-3) goes for the Blue Jays against Boston righty Nick Pivetta (6-1).	------	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

MINNEAPOLIS -- — Martín Maldonado hit a go-ahead double in the ninth, prompting a fan to toss an inflatable trash can onto the field, and the Houston Astros beat the Minnesota Twins 6-4 on Friday night.	This was Houston’s first trip to Target Field with fans in the stands since 2019, and the Astros heard a chorus of boos and chants of “You’re a cheater.”	The Astros came into Minnesota last year and swept the Twins in the AL wild-card playoff round. There were no crowds then and, now given a chance to sound off, Twins fans made known their displeasure over Houston’s sign-stealing scandal.	“We’re focused on playing baseball, playing good team baseball and controlling what we can control,” Astros third baseman Alex Bregman said. “I think we’re doing a great job of that. Offensively, I think we’re the best offense in baseball right now. So, it’s been fun to be a part of that.”	Jose Altuve and Yuli Gurriel homered and Bregman drove in two runs for Houston, which won for the fourth time in five games. Michael Brantley added three hits for the Astros, who are 29-17 since April 22 when they were 7-10 and at the bottom of the AL West.	Maldonado doubled to break a 4-all tie and Brantley added an RBI single.	Ryne Stanek (1-1) allowed a tying homer to Josh Donaldson in the eighth but earned the win in relief of starter José Urquidy. Ryan Pressly notched his 10th save in 11 chances.	Manager Dusty Baker said he could tell his team was fatigued after Thursday’s loss at Boston and arriving late to Minnesota.	“The pros, the real pros, know how to reach back and get some energy when they need it, and this team is full of real pros,” Baker said.	Donaldson homered twice and Nelson Cruz and Miguel Sanó also connected — all four Minnesota drives were solo shots.	The Twins have lost three of four. They couldn’t build any momentum from Thursday night’s walkoff win against the New York Yankees, when Donaldson and Cruz each connected for two-run homers in the ninth off closer Aroldis Chapman.	Matt Shoemaker (2-8), who was scheduled to start but was moved to the bullpen before the game, allowed two runs on three hits in relief.	“We believe he can go out there and get those guys out,” Minnesota manager Rocco Baldelli said. “It didn’t play out like that tonight. It’s one of those games that feels uncomfortable because you constantly have to shift your mindset as you go from up to down around to tied.”	CHANGE OF PLANS	Bailey Ober, the 6-foot-9 rookie made his third career start in place of Shoemaker. Ober pitched a career-long five innings, giving up two runs on seven hits and striking out a career-best seven batters.	Shoemaker was sent to the bullpen after surrendering 13 runs in 4 2/3 innings in his last two starts. He got just one out while allowing nine runs, eight earned, in a loss at Kansas City in his last start. He has a 7.28 ERA as a starter this year.	“He’s going to be ready to go tomorrow when we call on him tomorrow because we may need him to be available tomorrow, and ready to pitch, too,” Baldelli said. “I think that’s all part of being a reliever and there’s a lot that goes into it. It’s a different ballgame than being a starting pitcher, but I think he’s up for it.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Astros: RHP Enoli Paredes was placed on the 10-day injured list with a right shoulder strain. Ralph Garza Jr. was recalled from Triple-A Sugar Land. ... Baker said the reports on Lance McCullers Jr. (right shoulder soreness) were good after his Triple-A rehab start on Thursday. McCullers gave up one run on two hits in four innings, with no walks and four strikeouts.	Twins: OF Byron Buxton (right hip strain) took a day off from playing on his rehab assignment at Triple-A St. Paul. Buxton worked out at Target Field and will be in the lineup for St. Paul again on Saturday. … RHP Kenta Maeda (right adductor strain and general right arm soreness) will make his return from the injured list and start Monday’s game at Seattle. … OF Alex Kirilloff was in the lineup after spraining his left ankle in Thursday’s game.	UP NEXT	RHP Luis Garcia (5-3, 2.75 ERA) starts Saturday for Houston, carrying a streak of five straight starts with a win. He’s allowed six runs in 29 innings over that stretch. Minnesota will counter with RHP José Berríos (6-2, 3.58). Berríos allowed four runs in six innings but beat Kansas City in his last outing.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MILWAUKEE -- — Patience paid off for the Milwaukee Brewers on Friday night.	It helped that they were facing a Pittsburgh Pirates bullpen that couldn’t throw the ball over the plate no matter who was pitching.	Christian Yelich hit a bases-loaded double and Pittsburgh relievers issued three consecutive bases-loaded walks in a five-run seventh inning that helped the Brewers beat the Pirates 7-4.	“We took advantage of some wildness, which is what you've got to do,” Brewers manager Craig Counsell. “We made them be in the strike zone, and they weren't in the strike zone that inning.”	The Brewers tied a franchise record by drawing six walks in the seventh-inning rally that put them ahead for good. They also walked six times in an inning May 19, 1977, against Toronto and Sept. 21, 2006, against San Francisco.	“I don't think we were nibbling," Pirates manager Derek Shelton said. “I just think we struggled with our command tonight.”	Ke’Bryan Hayes hit a two-run homer,  and Ben Gamel and Gregory Polanco added solo shots for the Pirates, who lost their fifth straight. Pittsburgh pitchers issued a total of 11 walks.	The Brewers won for the 12th time in 14 games. The Brewers and Chicago Cubs are tied for first place in the NL Central.	“I feel right now we've got a really complete team, a complete group,” said Brewers catcher Omar Narváez, who went 2 for 3 and scored twice. "Everybody is trying to do their parts to be good, collectively.”	Yelich broke a 2-2 tie by delivering  what initially looked like a slow-rolling single up the middle off Clay Holmes (2-1). But Yelich kept running and made it to second for a two-run double.	“Definitely a hustle double, for sure,” Counsell said. “Just good baserunning. Out of the box, you could see what he was thinking.”	After striking out Avisaíl García and walking Narváez intentionally to load the bases with two outs, Holmes walked Willy Adames unintentionally to extend to Milwaukee’s lead to 5-2.	Holmes allowed five runs in one-third of an inning, ending a string of 14 straight scoreless appearances.	“Tonight he just didn't have his best stuff," Shelton said. “I think we've been really spoiled because he's been really good.”	Trevor Cahill replaced Holmes and walked Jace Peterson and Jackie Bradley Jr. to bring home two more runs.	Hayes’ homer off Koby Milner cut the Brewers’ lead to 7-4 in the eighth.	Brewers starter Brandon Woodruff (5-2) gave up the homers to Gamel and Polanco, but allowed only two other hits in a seven-inning stint that brought his ERA to 1.52. He struck out five and didn’t walk anyone.	This was the first time Woodruff had allowed multiple homers in a 2021 appearance.	“I knew coming in that this was going to be a tough lineup,” Woodruff said. “I know they don’t strike out a lot. It’s a contact-oriented team. They try to get a lot of action on the bases. I knew that they were going to be aggressive early, and I knew I just had to make some pitches early and just try to get some quick outs.”	Josh Hader pitched a scoreless ninth inning for his 15th save in as many opportunities.	Pirates starter Chase De Jong allowed two runs and four hits over five innings. He struck out two and walked four.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Pirates: 1B Colin Moran was out of the starting lineup for a second straight game after a pitch hit him on the right hand Wednesday, but he came in as a pinch-hitter in the ninth.	Brewers: Manager Craig Counsell said 3B Travis Shaw’s dislocated left shoulder likely will keep the 31-year-old unavailable until sometime in August.	ATTANASIO ENCOURAGED	Brewers owner Mark Attanasio spoke to reporters before Friday’s game and had plenty of praise for a starting rotation headed by Woodruff, Corbin Burnes (3-4, 1.97 ERA) and Freddy Peralta (6-1, 2.25).	“We made the decision three years ago to move these guys into the rotation, and there were some bumps in the road as everyone knew,” said Attanasio, who has been owner since 2005. “This was the hope, that we’d get this trio of guys to come together and to pitch like this, I think they’re three of the top starters in the league. It’s really fun, and maybe the best pitching we’ve had since I’ve owned the team on the whole.”	UP NEXT	These two NL Central foes continue their three-game series Saturday in Milwaukee. Scheduled starters are Chad Kuhl (0-3, 5.61) for the Pirates and Burnes for the Brewers.	------	Follow Steve Megargee at https://twitter.com/stevemegargee	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

PHOENIX -- — Shohei Ohtani looked hurt, hobbling around home plate after fouling a ball off the inside of his right knee.	Turns out there wasn't much wrong. In fact, the two-way star just got stronger.	Ohtani struck out eight, hit two doubles at the plate and pushed through an injury scare to lead the Los Angeles Angels past the slumping Arizona Diamondbacks 6-5 in 10 innings on Friday night.	“When he’s faced with a dilemma, he turns up the dial,” Angels manager Joe Maddon said. “Love it. He knows exactly what he’s doing at all times, I mean exactly.”	Max Stassi's RBI groundout scored Jared Walsh in the top of the 10th to put the Angels ahead for good. Extra innings were needed after Arizona's Eduardo Escobar hit a two-out, tying homer off Raisel Iglesias (4-2) in the ninth.	Alex Claudio earned his first save of the season by getting the final out when Stephen Vogt struck out on a check swing with two on. Arizona lost its eighth in a row.	It was another big night for Ohtani following a few worrisome moments in the third inning.	Ohtani — who was batting second — fell to his knees and grimaced in pain after the foul ball that caromed hard off his knee. He eventually got up and limped around for a few minutes as he talked with the team’s training staff.	The 26-year-old stayed in the game and a few pitches later lined an RBI double to right center that came off the bat at 114.9 miles per hour. He also threw a fastball that hit 99.6 mph in the bottom half of the inning.	“It’s pretty stiff right now, but during the game I don’t feel like it affected me too much,” Ohtani said.	Added Maddon: “Pretty much a brilliant night for Shohei."	Ohtani gave up two runs on five hits and two walks in five innings. He ran into trouble on the mound in the fifth with runners on first and second with one out.	The right-hander balked twice in the span of a few pitches, which brought home Josh Rojas. Ohtani looked like he got the third out of the inning when he struck out Escobar, but the pitch was in the dirt and skipped past catcher Kurt Suzuki. Escobar was able to make it to first while Ketel Marte scored.	Ohtani exited with a 3-2 lead, then moved to play right field. He added a double in the seventh to push Justin Upton to third base. Upton later scored on a wild pitch to give the Angels a 5-4 lead.	The Diamondbacks tied the game at 4 in the sixth after Rojas' RBI single scored Nick Ahmed. Arizona lost despite outhitting Los Angeles 10-9.	“We just couldn’t get that big knock,” Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said. “There was a lot of traffic out there today.”	Arizona has lost 31 of its last 36. The team's 20-44 record is the worst in the big leagues.	D-backs starter Merrill Kelly gave up three runs over five innings.	NOT SO FAST	Lovullo tried to remove left-handed pitcher Ryan Buchter after he faced just two batters in the 10th. The umpires didn't catch the error at first but eventually forced Buchter to face Kurt Suzuki.	Buchter promptly hit Suzuki with his next pitch. Lovullo then replaced Buchter with righty Riley Smith (1-4).	Since 2020, MLB changed the rules that pitchers have to face at least three consecutive batters unless there's an injury or the end of the inning.	THE DAY AFTER	The Diamondbacks were playing their first game since firing hitting coach Darnell Coles and assistant hitting coach Eric Hinske.	The team announced co-hitting coaches to replace the fired pair. Rick Short was promoted from Triple-A Reno and Drew Hedman was Arizona’s run production coordinator.	The D-backs came into the game batting .231 and scored just 12 runs over the previous six-game road trip.	MORE PITCHER PAIN	Kelly had his own injury scare in the fifth inning when he took a line drive off his left shoulder that came off Ohtani's bat at 108.7 mph.	In a stroke of good fortune for the D-backs, the ball bounced off Kelly's arm directly to first baseman Asdrubal Cabrera, who tagged Ohtani for the out. Kelly stayed in the game and got the next batter, Anthony Rendon, to pop up for the third out.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: Suzuki left the game in the 10th after getting hit by a pitch for the second time on Friday. He was hit on the left hamstring. He was replaced by pinch-runner Griffin Canning, who is usually a pitcher. Maddon said he thought Suzuki would be fine and that the pitch caught him in an awkward spot behind the knee.	Diamondbacks: RHP Zac Gallen (elbow sprain) recently threw a bullpen and is scheduled to throw a simulated game on Saturday. ... LHP Madison Bumgarner (shoulder inflammation) has resumed playing catch. He hasn't pitched since June 2 after being removed after two innings against the Mets.	UP NEXT	The Diamondbacks will send LHP Caleb Smith (2-2, 3.14 ERA) to the mound on Saturday to face Angels RHP Alex Cobb (4-2, 4.24).	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- — Elvis Andrus hit a winning single in the ninth inning after making pair of fielding gaffes, and the Oakland Athletics beat the Kansas City Royals 4-3 on Friday night.	With the score 3-all, Matt Chapman doubled over leaping third baseman Hanser Alberto with one out and Seth Brown was intentionally walked by Scott Barlow (2-2).	Andrus, whose .213 average coming in was 140th among 143 qualified batters, followed with a sharp liner to right, and Chapman scored with a headfirst slide ahead of Jarrod Dyson’s throw.	“This is a veteran guy, the moment’s not too big for him,” A’s manager Bob Melvin said. “He’s done it plenty of times. Doesn’t surprise me. He’s done it against us many times over the years.”	Andrus delivered the game-winning hit not long after his defense helped the Royals tie the game.	Andrus made a two-out fielding error on Michael Taylor’s grounder to shortstop that led to an unearned run in the eighth. Andrus then was slow on his throw to second baseman Jed Lowrie on Hanser Alberto’s grounder, extending the inning.	“When you make an error (you) always want redemption,” Andrus said. “It’s not too often you get the opportunity.”	Seth Brown homered to snap a long funk for the A’s. Chapman had three hits including an RBI double.	Salvador Pérez hit solo homers in the seventh against Cole Irvin and the eighth against former teammate Jake Diekman, becoming the first Kansas City player to homer twice from the seventh inning on since Mike Moustakas at Baltimore on Sept. 12, 2015. He joined Bo Jackson in 1987 as the only Royals with three multihomer games by the end of June.	“He’s been amazing all season long,” Royals manager Mike Matheny said. “When we need big hits he seems to find it.”	Kansas City has lost six of seven.	Lou Trivino (3-2) retired four batters.	The A’s are 7-2 in June, tied with the Angels and Brewers for the best in the majors.	Pérez hit his 15th home run of the season leading off the seventh, then connected for a tying shot in the eighth for his ninth career multihomer game.	Brown snapped a 1 for 30 funk with his two-run homer off Brady Singer in the fourth.	PLAY AT THE PLATE	The Royals bungled a chance to add on in the eighth when Andrew Benintendi was thrown out trying to score from first on Hunter Dozier’s bloop to center. Benintendi appeared to hesitate briefly after rounding third, and A’s first baseman Matt Olson made a perfect relay throw to catcher Aramis Garcia who tagged Benintendi as he slid headfirst.	“It was really close,” Matheny said. “The cameras are so good, we could see afterward it looked like his hand was in there before the tag but hovering. He beat it. He just couldn’t get that (hand) on the plate.”	FOR STARTERS	Irvin allowed two runs — one earned — and six hits in six-plus inning. Singer had seven strikeouts in six innings. He allowed three runs, five hits and walked one.	SHORT HOPS	Diekman has three blown saves this season. ... Whit Merrifield played in his 369th consecutive game, the longest active streak in the majors. ... Nearly two weeks after a foul ball by Juan Lagares of the Angels broke a pane of glass above the second deck at the Coliseum, the window has yet to be replaced.	GLOVE WORK	Chapman made a nifty running catch to track down Benintendi’s foul ball in the second inning before stumbling over the bullpen mound near the stands behind third base.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Royals: Matheny was pleased with how well LHP Danny Duffy threw Thursday but said how Duffy responds a day after is more important. Duffy has been on the injured list since May 17 with a left forearm flexor strain.	Athletics: CF Ramón Laureano (strained right hip) ran sprints, threw to bases and took batting practice before the game. Laureano also stood in the box during LHP J.B. Wendelken’s bullpen session. Wendelken (strained left oblique) will throw to hitters again Monday before heading out on a rehab assignment.	UP NEXT	A’s rookie RHP James Kaprielian (2-1, 3.08 ERA) faces the Royals for the first time Saturday as he continues his comeback from Tommy John surgery in 2017. Kaprielian has allowed two or fewer earned runs in four of his five starts. RHP Jackson Kowar (0-1, 54.00) starts for Kansas City after allowing four runs and retiring two batters in his major league debut against the Angels on Monday.	----	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

LOS ANGELES -- — Dodgers manager Dave Roberts got everything he had hoped for.	Clayton Kershaw bounced back from two bad outings with six sharp innings Friday night, and Gavin Lux drove in four runs and hit one of five homers as Los Angeles routed the Texas Rangers 12-1.	But Roberts' joy after the win was tempered due to possible injuries to Max Muncy and Cody Bellinger.	Muncy, whose two-run shot in the first inning started the barrage, felt something in his right side tighten during the at-bat and left the game after homering. Bellinger was limping rounding first base after an RBI single in the fifth inning, and his night also ended early.	Roberts said he is hoping Muncy doesn't have an issue with his oblique, while Bellinger's issue could be a hamstring. Roberts said there will be additional testing and clarity on Saturday.	“We were starting to get healthy and feel good, but that's baseball,” Roberts said. “We will hold out hope that it will be short term.”	The defending World Series champions were 18-17 on May 9, but have won 20 of 28 — including four straight — since then.	“Our lineup is pretty tough to hit when we are pretty much at full strength,” said Kershaw, who struck out nine. “Hopefully Cody and Max are OK and we can keep that momentum going.”	Muncy, Justin Turner and Lux homered in the first inning to stake the Dodgers to a 6-0 lead.	Albert Pujols and Will Smith also went deep in the fourth inning as Los Angeles sent Texas to its 16th straight road loss.	Kershaw (8-5) returned to the form that has made him the longtime ace of the Dodgers staff. The left-hander, who had allowed five runs in each of his last two starts for the first time since 2011, gave up only one unearned and three hits with one walk.	Kershaw also was one of six Dodgers to have two hits, and his RBI single in the third extended their lead to 8-0.	“He was really good and wasn’t stressed at all. The fastball command and everything was good,” Roberts said of Kershaw.	After Mookie Betts led off by reaching base on an error, Muncy drove Mike Foltynewicz’s slider over the wall in right-center. Turner followed two pitches later with a drive to center, making the fourth time this season the Dodgers have had back-to-back homers.	Lux added a three-run homer with one out and marked the first time since 2015 that the Dodgers had connected three times in the opening frame. He also had an RBI double in the third.	Pujols, who replaced Muncy in the second inning, and Smith had solo shots in the fourth to make it 10-0. Los Angeles added two more in the fifth on Cody Bellinger’s RBI single and a sacrifice fly by Chris Taylor.	Foltynewicz (1-7) went 2 2/3 innings and tied a career-high with eight runs allowed (seven earned) on eight hits. The right-hander is the first Texas pitcher to allow three home runs in the first inning since A.J. Griffin in 2017 at Detroit.	“He lobbed too many down the middle. He has to do a better job. He's a major league pitcher,” manager Chris Woodward said of Foltynewicz.	Woodward said he had a staff meeting before the game to discuss the losing streak, but his more immediate focus was on the short term.	“Tomorrow we have to go out and win a game,” he said. “It's not rocket science. The more we talk about what we can't do, the more we are losing focus about what we can do. I don't care about the losing streak. I want to play a clean game.”	RARE FEAT	Kershaw had a four-strikeout inning for the first time in his career during the fourth inning. Adolis Garcia struck out on the 10th pitch of his at-bat, but got to first due to a wild pitch.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: Roberts said it is a possibility SS Corey Seager could begin a rehab assignment in two weeks. Seager, who has been on the injured list since May 16 with a broken right hand, has started to take two-hand swings but with a tennis ball.	UP NEXT	Dodgers RHP Trevor Bauer (6-4, 2.40 ERA) is sixth in the majors with 103 strikeouts and has allowed two or fewer earned runs in all but three of his 13 starts, He will be opposed by Texas LHP Kolby Allard (1-2, 3.41 ERA), who was born in Anaheim and has not previously faced the Dodgers.	------	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

WASHINGTON -- —	Erick Fedde returned after nearly a month on the COVID-19 injured list and pitched five sharp innings, Kyle Schwarber hit a leadoff homer and the Washington Nationals beat the San Francisco Giants 2-0 Saturday to open a doubleheader.	The Nationals handed Kevin Gausman (7-1) his first loss this season. He began the day with a 1.27 ERA, but Schwarber quickly put a dent in that impressive number.	Washington is now 1-5 in seven-inning games this year after Thursday’s rainout led to the day-night split doubleheader. The NL West-leading Giants are 1-2 in seven-inning games.	Fedde (4-4) last pitched on May 16 and was placed on the COVID-19 list three days later after testing positive. He rejoined the rotation by limiting the Giants to four hits while striking out seven and walking none.	“When they called me and told me, I was shocked,” Fedde said about his diagnosis.	“Obviously I’m not a scientist, but I was vaccinated and I felt great. I’m more than thankful I didn’t pass it around the team," he said.	Brad Hand pitched a perfect seventh for his 11th save.	Schwarber hit his sixth career leadoff homer, connecting for a drive into the second deck in left field. A day after being shut out by San Francisco, Schwarber broke the scoreless string with his 10th home run this season, tied with Trea Turner for the team lead.	Josh Harrison’s RBI double in the fourth made it 2-0. Giants right fielder Mike Yastrzemski got twisted around trying to make the catch which resulted in the ball hitting the wall, allowing Juan Soto to score from first.	Gausman allowed two runs on three hits while striking out four in four innings, and exited with a 1.43 ERA.	“Not how I wanted to start the game, obviously,” Gausman said after his shortest outing of the season.	“They got me early. We were in a hole right from the get-go," he said.	The Nationals won with four hits. The Giants got five hits and were shut out for the third time this season and first since April 12.	NEEDED THAT	With Stephen Strasburg (neck) on the 10-day injured list and Max Scherzer’s status up in the air after leaving Friday’s game after just 12 pitches, manager Dave Martinez was more than pleased to have Fedde back in his rotation.	“That was amazing,” Martinez said about Fedde’s return.	“Came out and gave us the five innings we needed. That was a great performance by Fedde.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Giants: Manager Gabe Kapler said it’s possible C Curt Casali (left wrist strain) could be reinstated off the 10-day IL for the second game.	Nationals: Martinez said he talked with Scherzer and that the Nationals ace feels a tick better than he did on Friday after feeling a tweak in his groin area. Scherzer was able to do some exercise and also received treatment on Saturday. … Right-handed reliever Daniel Hudson was placed on the 10-day IL with right elbow inflammation after having an MRI on Friday. The move is retroactive to June 10.	UP NEXT	Giants: LHP Connor Menez (1-0, 0.00 ERA) will make his fifth appearance of the season and first start since August 11, 2019, in the second half of the doubleheader.	Nationals: RHP Jefry Rodriguez, who was recalled from Triple-A Rochester on Saturday, will make his first start of the season. Rodriquez went 3-3 with the Nationals in 2018 and last appeared in the majors in 2019 with Cleveland.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PHILADELPHIA -- — Jean Segura scored Ronald Torreyes with an infield single in the 10th inning for his second straight game-ending hit and the Philadelphia Phillies got a third consecutive walkoff win with an 8-7 victory over the New York Yankees on Saturday.	After Yankees star DJ LeMahieu hit a tying, three-run homer in the ninth, Phillies reliever Archie Bradley (2-1) pitched a perfect 10th to strand the designated runner.	Travis Jankowski led off the bottom of the inning against Aroldis Chapman (4-2) by reaching on the pitcher’s error. Jankowski bunted to the left side of the mound, and Chapman fielded the ball, checked Torreyes running to third base, then hurried a throw high to first. Torreyes, the designated runner, advanced to third.	“That might be one of the toughest guys to bunt in the league,” Phillies manager Joe Girardi said. “He put it in (Chapman’s) hands, and his speed allowed him to get to first base. It made all the difference in the world. We may not score that run.”	Odubel Herrera popped out, then Segura hit a hard grounder to third baseman Gio Urshela, who dived toward the line to catch it but couldn’t relay the ball home ahead of the sprinting Torreyes.	“Knew it was going to be a tough one,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said.	Segura hit a two-run single off the wall in left-center Thursday to wrap a 4-3 win over the Braves. Luke Williams’ homer in the ninth on Wednesday sent the Phillies to the first of their three dramatic wins.	Bradley got Urshela to ground out before striking out Gary Sánchez and Kyle Higashioka	Bryce Harper doubled, had two singles and drove in two for the Phillies, who have won five of six.	Sánchez hit a solo homer and had an RBI single, and Rougned Odor also went deep for the Yankees, who have lost six of eight.	“We didn’t get the result, we didn’t get the win, but really I like how we competed and how we’re playing,” LeMahieu said. “I know those results are going to come.”	Hector Neris blew his fourth save in 13 chances for Philadelphia in the ninth.	After starting the frame with an out, Neris walked Brett Gardner and Tyler Wade. LeMahieu tied it by driving a 2-2, 84-mph splitter over the wall in left for his fourth homer, causing an eruption from the large contingent of Yankees fans in attendance.	Neris avoided more damage by striking out Aaron Judge and Gleyber Torres.	The Phillies nearly won it in the ninth after Harper’s leadoff double against Chad Green. Rhys Hoskins popped out and Andrew McCutchen was intentionally walked before Torres made a game-saving, diving stop on Alec Bohm’s grounder up the middle.	Torres kept the ball in the infield to prevent Harper from scoring and flipped to second for an out. Green struck out Torreyes to end the inning.	“Really special play,” Boone said.	Chapman, the Yankees’ closer, lost his second consecutive outing. He gave up two homers in New York’s 7-5 loss at Minnesota on Thursday.	The Phillies scored four runs in the first against Jameson Taillon, who recorded just one out before being lifted. After three singles to open the game, Harper followed with a two-run single to center. Two batters later, McCutchen hit a sacrifice fly, and Taillon’s day was done after surrendering Bohm’s RBI single.	Phillies starter Vince Velasquez allowed two runs and six hits with five strikeouts and a walk in five innings.	PHILLY PROBLEMS	It was the shortest outing ever for Taillon, whose ERA rose from 5.09 to 5.74. The right-hander’s previous shortest career stint was 1 2/3 innings, also in Philadelphia while pitching for the Pirates on April 19, 2018. In three starts at Citizens Bank Park, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2010 draft has an 11.57 ERA with nine runs and 13 hits allowed in seven innings.	PHILLY (AND NEW YORK) FANS	In the second series since restrictions were lifted on fan attendance in Philadelphia, a crowd of 38,450 was the largest for the Phillies since 2019. Yankees fans appeared to make up at least half of those in attendance, with many “Let’s Go Yankees!” chants popping up through the game.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Yankees: RHP Luis Severino (recovery Tommy John surgery) was removed from a minor league rehab start with a right groin injury. He will have an MRI on Sunday. Severino was making his second rehab start, pitching for High-A Hudson Valley against Brooklyn. ... LHP Zack Britton was reinstated from the 60-day IL and pitched a 1-2-3 seventh inning with a strikeout. Britton had surgery for a bone spur in his left elbow on March 15. ... 1B Luke Voit (right oblique strain) will begin a rehab assignment on Sunday.	UP NEXT	Yankees RHP Domingo Germán (4-3, 3.12) opposes Phillies RHP Aaron Nola (4-4, 4.06) in the conclusion of the two-game series on Sunday.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- — Matt Olson had four hits, including his 16th home run, and the Oakland Athletics roughed up Kansas City rookie Jackson Kowar in romping past the Royals 11-2 on Saturday.	Matt Chapman also connected and drove in three runs. Skye Bolt added his first career home run as the A’s improved to 11-2 against teams from the AL Central.	“The last two days it’s nice to get some results and find ways to help the team win,” said Chapman, who had three hits in Oakland’s 4-3 win on Friday. “We’ve had some guys grinding, carrying the weight so it’s nice to do my part. We’ve got a good team, we’re in first place, and I want to do what I can to help.”	James Kaprielian (3-1) overcame control issues and pitched two-hit ball over six innings for the A’s.	The highly touted Kowar (0-2) was tagged for four runs on five hits and three walks in just 1 1/3 innings.	The 33rd overall pick in 2018, Kowar made his major league debut last Monday and got only two outs against the Angels, allowing four runs on three hits, two walks and three wild pitches.	“He’s fighting to get his spikes in the dirt and feel comfortable out there,” Royals manager Mike Matheny said. “I know there’s more in there. We’re wanting him to get comfortable and trust his stuff, which right now is easier said than done.”	Kowar has a 36.00 ERA after two starts but doesn’t feel he’s that far off.	“There’s just some simple things that I didn’t do very well,” Kowar said. “I don’t know how many times, if any, I threw strike one, which is stuff that you do since high school. It’s hard to get anybody out where you’re constantly 1-0.”	Kelvin Gutiérrez homered for Kansas City, which has lost seven of eight.	Olson had singles in the first and sixth innings, doubled in a run in the second and homered off Wade Davis as part of Oakland’s five-run eighth.	Chapman lined a two-run double off the left-field wall against Kowar in the second, then hit an opposite-field home run off Carlos Hernández in the sixth. It’s Chapman’s first home run since May 5.	Bolt hit his home run leading off the eighth.	Acquired from the Yankees in 2017 as part of a trade that sent pitcher Sonny Gray to New York, Kaprielian walked a career-high four but had seven strikeouts and retired the final eight he faced after back-to-back walks in the fourth.	“I take pride in being able to pitch out of jams and I did another good job of that today,” Kaprielian said. “I can’t be walking guys. That just can’t happen, and I did that too many times today.”	Kaprielian twice pitched out of bases-loaded jams, getting Andrew Benintendi to pop out to end the second and Nicky Lopez to ground out in the third.	“Probably in the middle innings he really struggled with his command some, then finds a way to get through it,” manager Bob Melvin said. “He was able to put it behind him and go out there and compete. He’s had a way of wiggling out of some innings the entire year.”	Jesús Luzardo retired five batters and allowed Gutiérrez’s home run. Sergio Romo got the final out in the eighth and Cam Bedrosian pitched the ninth to complete the five-hitter.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Royals: LHP Danny Duffy came out of his latest throwing session feeling well, although Matheny again declined to set a timetable for Duffy’s return. “I don’t imagine we’d even talk about anything until we’ve given him live action or multiple innings of live action,” Matheny said. “He felt really good yesterday and was excited about being able to throw all his pitches.” … Matheny said “there’s realistic hope” that INF Adalberto Mondesi (left hamstring strain) will come off the IL when the Royals return to Kansas City to begin a six-game homestand Monday.	Athletics: Leadoff batter Mark Canha was given the day off. … RHP Mike Fiers has taken a pause in his throwing program after feeling some discomfort in his most recent workout while recovering from a sprained right elbow. Melvin wouldn’t call it a setback because Fiers has yet to throw off a mound.	UP NEXT	A’s RHP Chris Bassitt (6-2, 3.44 ERA) takes a career-high six-game winning streak into Sunday’s series finale. It will be Bassitt’s second start against Kansas City. LHP Kris Bubic (1-1, 3.32) goes for the Royals. Bubic has 22 strikeouts in 25 1/3 innings as a starter.	----	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

PHOENIX -- — It took a while, but the Los Angeles Angels are back at .500.	Anthony Rendon homered and drove in four runs, and the Angels rallied from a five-run deficit to beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 8-7 on Saturday. The win moved Los Angeles to .500 (32-32) for the first time since May 2.	“It definitely is an achievement,” said Angels manager Joe Maddon. “It's a goal. You have to get there. I could not be more impressed with this group. Now you have to continue one game at a time and the next goal is five over (.500), 10 over, etc.”	Trailing 6-5, the Angels scored three runs in the top of the ninth inning off Arizona closer Joakim Soria. Jose Iglesias and Taylor Ward had RBI singles and Rendon delivered a sacrifice fly.	Reliever Alex Claudio (1-1) pitched a scoreless inning of relief to get the win and Raisel Iglesias earned his 11th save for the Angels.	Soria (0-3) took the loss and Josh Rojas homered twice for the Diamondbacks, who lost their ninth straight game and have dropped 32 of their last 37. Arizona has the worst record in the big leagues at 21-45.	“A few things that are a little inconsistent is the ability for us to go out and make statements and do things with conviction,” Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said. “Teams can sense when you're lacking a little bit of conviction. We have to keep grinding. Nobody is going to feel sorry for us.”	Maddon said he hopes the game is a springboard for Rendon, who came into the contest hitting .233 with three homers.	“It's really big,” Maddon said. “Listen, I don't care how long you've played and how much you've accomplished. Confidence can wane at different moments. When it takes a leave of absence it's tough ... It's all about confidence. I want to believe that game today because those were crispy off his bat. That game today can get him rolling.”	Rendon said he felt no different Saturday than he has all season: “To be honest I feel the same, which is terrifying,” he said, adding that he was more impressed with the Angels reaching the .500 mark.	“Oh man, it's great to be on the roll we are on,” Rendon said. “The energy level is up. We're having fun right now.”	Arizona took a 5-0 lead off Los Angeles starter Alex Cobb in the third inning. The Diamondbacks batted around and had six straight hits off Cobb, all coming with two outs. David Peralta drove in two runs with a double, Christian Walker added an RBI double and Eduardo Escobar had an RBI single.	Maddon credited reliever Jose Suarez for keeping the Angels in the game. Suarez threw four innings of one-run ball in relief of Cobb.	“Suarez made that game possible,” Maddon said. “He kind of kept everything in order with the performance he gave.”	Rendon's solo homer and an RBI pinch-hit single cut Arizona's lead to 5-2 in the fourth inning, and the Angels added two more runs in the fifth on a two-run double by Rendon.	Rojas gave the Diamondbacks a two-run cushion in the top of the seventh with a lead-off homer off Suarez. The Angels sliced the margin to 6-5 on a sacrifice bunt by Kean Wong, but Shohei Ohtani, who had a pinch-hit single, was stranded at third to end the eighth inning.	ROSTER MOVE	Los Angeles traded RHP Hunter Strickland to Milwaukee for cash considerations. Strickland had a 9.95 ERA in nine appearances for the Angels. Los Angeles had designated Strickland for assignment earlier in the week.	TRAINER'S ROOM	ANGELS Pitcher Jose Quintana (left shoulder inflammation) will throw a bullpen session Monday. Quintana was placed on the 10-day injured list May 31.	DIAMONDBACKS: Pitcher Zac Gallen (UCL sprain) threw 46 pitches in a 2 2/3 inning simulated game Saturday. Lovullo said Gallen felt good after the outing but that the next step in his rehab has yet to be determined.	UP NEXT	LHP Patrick Sandoval (0-2, 3.62) will look for his first win of the season Sunday for Los Angeles while Arizona will counter with RHP Jon Duplantier (0-2, 10.03), who will face the Angels for the first time in his career.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

MIAMI -- —	Zach Thompson pitched five scoreless inning and earned his first major league win, leading the Miami Marlins to a 4-2 victory over the Atlanta Braves on Saturday.	Adam Duvall and Lewin Díaz hit solo homers for Miami, which won its third straight overall and second straight over the Braves to claim its first home series against Atlanta since Oct. 1, 2017.	“It’s kind of what we needed after that last trip to be able to come home and play well. It’s important for us to get some momentum,” Miami manager Don Mattingly said of his club’s 1-9 road trip that preceded the current homestand. “Hopefully, we’re able to close these guys out (Sunday). We can’t afford to stop.”	Díaz hit his first major league homer, a pinch-hit shot to start the fifth inning.	Thompson (1-1) started the planned bullpen game and limited Atlanta to three hits, striking out six in a longer-than-expected outing.	“I don’t know if it’s truly hit me yet,” Thompson said. “I’m sure it will shortly.”	The 27-year-old right-hander pumped his fist after his outing-ending strike out of Ronald Acuña in the fifth.	“Acuña is an amazing player,” Thompson said. “Being able to shut them down that last inning was a really important factor for me and I think my emotions showed it.”	In addition to the win, Thompson got his first major league hit when he singled in the second.	Freddie Freeman hit his 15th homer, a two-run shot against reliever Anthony Bass in the eighth, as the Braves lost their fourth straight.	“We’ve got to continue to prepare and play hard, you have to handle it,” Atlanta manager Brian Snitker said. “We’ve been through this all year, where we have to handle tough situations and these guys have.”	The Marlins scored in the first without a hit. Jazz Chisholm walked, advanced two bases on a groundout and wild pitch and raced home on Jésus Aguilar’s sacrifice fly.	Duvall’s leadoff homer in the fourth put Miami ahead 2-0. Duvall drove Atlanta starter Max Fried’s 0-2 pitch into the walkway above left center for his 12th home run of the season.	Fried (3-4) was lifted after six innings. The left-hander allowed three runs, five hits, struck out four and walked two. He remains winless against Miami in eight career starts.	Anthony Bender relieved Thompson and pitched 1 2/3 scoreless innings, and Richard Bleier got the final out in the seventh. Dylan Floro closed it with a perfect ninth for his second save in five chances.	Aguilar’s RBI single in the eighth gave Miami its final margin.	“With these guys, you know they’re going to keep coming at some point,” Mattingly said. “When they break out, they break out big. Any run you can get, you feel better about.”	Acuña singled before Freeman’s homer and has reached base 21 consecutive games.	MIGHTY THOMPSON AT THE PLATE:	A soft liner to right that fell in front of Acuña enabled Thompson to not only reflect on his pitching performance, but the base hit.	“That was really cool,” Thompson said. “Swung a bat I think two days ago for the first time in years.”	ON THE ROAD AGAIN:	Even after the Marlins end their six-game homestand Sunday, the total through 65 games still shows a road tilt. Once they finish the series with the Braves, the Marlins will have completed 30 home games, compared to 35 on the road. The road slant is based on the 10 games played in each of Miami’s three previous trips. The Marlins’ next road trip beginning Monday will feature six games and two stops.	“The way our schedule lined up, we had those three really long road trips back to back to back so you kind of feel you’re constantly on the road,” Miami infielder Jon Berti said. “It’s been a nice change of pace to be back home in a familiar ballpark and a place we like to play.”	TRAINER’S ROOM:	Marlins: LHP Trevor Rogers (undisclosed injury) was placed on the 10-day injured list and is expected to be recalled before his next scheduled start on Tuesday.	UP NEXT:	LHP Drew Smily (2-3, 5.82) will start the series finale for the Braves on Sunday, while the Marlins will go with RHP Pablo López (2-3, 2.76).	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- — Joey Wendle hit an RBI double during a three-run first inning and the AL East-leading Tampa Bay Rays handed the Baltimore Orioles their record-setting 14th consecutive road loss, 5-4 on Saturday.	It is the longest skid since team moved from St. Louis to Baltimore in 1954. The Orioles dropped 13 straight on the road in 2018 and also in 1988.	“It's not fun to lose,” Baltimore manager Brandon Hyde said. “Hopefully we can turn it around tomorrow.”	Since the beginning of May, the Rays (41-24) are a major league-best 28-10.	“It's been a pretty special run.” Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash said. “The guys have found ways to win in different ways. Just keep winning at this clip and we're going to be in line for some good things. To date we have to pleased with where we're at.”	Reliever Collin McHugh (1-1) struck out five and gave up one hit in two scoreless innings to pick up his first win since Aug. 30, 2019.	Diego Castillo worked the ninth and got his 11th save.	Austin Wynns hit a grand slam for the Orioles, who are 0-5 against Tampa Bay this season..	Tampa Bay starter Rich Hill gave up four runs, four hits, three walks and struck out five over 4 ⅔ innings. The 41-year old had allowed just three earned runs over 39 ⅔ innings in his previous seven starts.	Hill had grounders go off his leg in the second and fifth innings.	Cash said Hill was fine and not affected by the balls.	Wendle grounded a two-out double down the third-base line off Jorge López (2-7) in the first before Manuel Margot and Kevin Kiermaier had run-scoring infield singles as the Rays took a 3-0 lead.	Brandon Lowe made it 5-0 on a two-out, two-run double in the fourth that bounced over left fielder Ryan Mountcastle’s head, which allowed the second run to score.	Lowe, who entered Friday with the AL’s second-lowest batting average at .188, has four hits in seven at-bats with four RBI in the two games	Wynns got the Orioles within 5-4 with his first career grand slam in the fifth. His first homer since Sept. 24, 2019, ended Hill’s scoreless streak at 16 innings.	López gave up five runs and eight hits in 4 ⅔ innings. He struck out eight and walked one.	“I thought he threw the ball great,” Hyde said. “He got beat by three opposite-field soft singles in the first inning. He got really, really unlucky.”	NO WORRIES	López hit Brett Phillips, his former teammate in Milwaukee and Kansas City with a pitch in the fourth.	Phillips displayed fake anger that prompted plate umpire Nick Mahrley to get in front of him. Soon after, a laughing Phillips went to first base.	“When I got hit I was like, you know what, I'm going to have a little fun with this," said Phillips, who called López one of his favorite teammates. “So I immediately turned around and I was like, ‘do you want to fight with me?’ I said it with a smile on my face but the umpire and catcher couldn't see that I was laughing.”	López said Phillips is like a brother.	“He's funny,” López said. “Everything was kind of fun."	TRAINER’S ROOM	Orioles: OF Austin Hays went 0 for 4 and is hitless in eight at-bats, including five strikeouts, since returning Friday from a left hamstring strain.	Rays: 1B Ji-Man Choi (left groin strain) should have his return date set on Sunday. … RHP Chris Archer (forearm tightness) could be ready for live batting practice in late June or early July.	Umpires: Mahrley was checked out by a trainer after getting hit in the left arm by a pitch that bounced in front of the plate from Baltimore reliever Tanner Scott in the sixth. He was also looked at after getting struck by a ball during the first.	UP NEXT	Orioles LHP Bruce Zimmermann (4-3), on a career-high three-game winning streak, will start Sunday’s series finale. Tampa Bay LHP Josh Fleming (5-4) will start or follow an opener.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

DETROIT -- — Dylan Cease became the first White Sox pitcher to win his first eight career starts against an opponent, cruising to a 15-2 romp over the Detroit Tigers on Saturday.	Cease is the first major league pitcher to win his first eight starts against another team since Jamie Moyer started 10-0 against the Marlins in 2006-08.	“I've been really locked in the last few times I've faced them, and that makes me hard to hit,” he said. “They've got a good lineup, though, so I've been lucky enough to have this much success.”	Brian Goodwin, called up from the minors on Thursday, homered and drove in five runs in his White Sox debut.	“It was great to have a chance to show my new teammates that I'm going to be able to help them win games,” said Goodwin, who signed with Chicago as a free agent last month. "This is the first team that ever drafted me, and even though I didn't sign out of high school, I've still always had some love for the White Sox.	“Plus this seemed like a team I could help win some games," he said.	Cease (5-2) allowed two runs on four hits in five innings before being removed with a 13-2 lead. He walked one and struck out seven and saw his career ERA against Detroit rise to 2.09.	“He was pitching fine, but he had too many long innings in the dugout and we didn't want his arm to get cold,” White Sox manager Tony La Russa said. “We had him throw in the cage a few times, but you can only do that so many times.”	Tigers starter Jose Urena (2-6) allowed eight runs while getting only five outs.	Doubles by Tim Anderson and Goodwin made it 1-0 after three pitches, Urena hit Yasmani Grandal and Jose Abreu reached on an error to load the bases.	Yermin Mercedes hit a two-run single through the drawn-in infield, and the runners moved up on Eric Haase's passed ball.	Urena struck out Adam Eaton, drawing a sarcastic cheer from the crowd, and escaped the inning without further damage.	Detroit also scored quickly, with Harold Castro hitting a two-run homer on Cease's seventh pitch, but he struck out the next three hitters.	The White Sox made it 6-2 in the second on Goodwin's three-run homer off Urena.	“Obviously, he didn't have his best stuff today,” Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said. “It was big for us to get two runs in the first after they got three, but we weren't executing on the mound and our bats never did anything else.”	Daniel Norris came in from the Tigers bullpen with two out and two on, walked his first batter, then allowed a two-run single to Leury Garcia. After another walk, Danny Mendick's second of the inning, Norris got out of the inning.	Chicago scored five more runs in the fifth off Tigers relievers Beau Burrows and Alex Lange and scored twice in the eighth off catcher Jake Rogers.	“I was trying to throw softly, but I couldn't get the ball to the plate,” said Rogers, whose velocity jumped from 66 mph to 78 in mid-inning. “Once I started throwing a little bit harder, I felt a lot more comfortable.”	Utilityman Harold Castro pitched a scoreless ninth while Rogers made his professional debut at third base. Castro has pitched two innings this year without allowing a hit or a run.	MOVES	The Tigers moved 3B Jeimer Candelario from the bereavement list to the 10-day injured list. Candelario remains in the Dominican Republic to deal with a family emergency.	Burrows, who left the game with an illness, was optioned to Triple-A Toledo after the game. The Tigers will call up a pitcher on Sunday.	EVASIVE MANEUVERS	Mendick scored on Anderson's fifth-inning single, but only after protecting his health. Mendick was on second when Anderson's 101-mph line drive came directly at him, forcing him to dive to the ground before getting back up to score.	UP NEXT	The White Sox will go for a series sweep on Sunday, with Carlos Rodon (5-2, 1.96) starting against Tigers opener Kyle Funkhouser (0-0, 2.70) in a bullpen game for Detroit.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MILWAUKEE -- — Brewers ace Corbin Burnes has made things easy for his teammates this season, shutting down opponents and working deep into games.	When he failed to do either of those things Saturday, Milwaukee paid him back with a dominant bullpen effort and a five-run outburst in the fourth innin gto key a 7-4 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates.	“We kind of owed him one of those," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said.	Burnes allowed three runs in the first inning, got himself under control but then loaded the bases with no outs in the fifth. Trevor Richards (1-0) relieved and struck out three straight to end the threat and preserve a three-run lead.	“That’s obviously the best inning we’ve seen him have,” Counsell said of Richards.	Christian Yelich delivered the biggest hit of the day, doubling to left-center with the bases loaded and one out in the pivotal fifth. It was one of two hits for Yelich, who recorded his first multihit game since May 24 and sixth of the season.	“I was just trying not to really roll something over,” Yelich said. "Make sure that if you’re going to go early there, swing at a pitch early in the count, make sure that you’re being smart with it.”	Pittsburgh right-hander Chad Kuhl (0-4) gave up six runs, five earned, with five hits and four walks over 3 1/3 innings. He struck out two while losing to Milwaukee for the first time in 10 career appearances (nine starts).	“I've been struggling," Kuhl said. "It’s frustrating from a personal standpoint, not being about to go out there and be the guy people expect you to be.”	The Pirates had 10 hits, including three from second baseman Adam Fraizer, but went 2 for 16 with runners in scoring position and stranded 10.	“We had some situations to score runs against the back end of the bullpen,” Pirates manager Derek Shelton said. “We have to be better and find a way to put the ball into play.”	Pittsburgh got an early jump on Burnes, who gave up four runs, two earned, with eight hits and three walks while striking out eight over four innings.	The normally locked-in Burnes found himself in a 2-0 hole just 19 pitches into the game. Fraizer and Phillip Evans opened with back-to-back singles and scored when Burnes made a bad throw on a comebacker by Bryan Reynolds.	Reynolds scored when Jacob Stallings bounced into a double play for the first two outs of the inning, and the Pirates added another when Erik Gonzalez and Ka’ai Tom opened the second with consecutive triples.	Burnes retired seven of his next 10 batters, striking out five, before struggling in the fifth.	“When you’re giving up bloop hits and two triples that weren’t hit over 70 mph, it’s kind of tough to get upset about it," Burnes said. “You just shake your head. That’s baseball.”	Milwaukee has won three straight and 13 of 15. It sits a half-game ahead of the Cubs in the NL Central while the Pirates dropped their sixth in a row and ninth in 12 games.	SHAW READY TO REHAB	Brewers third baseman Travis Shaw will take a few more days to let the pain in his dislocated left shoulder subside before starting a rehab plan that he hopes will have him back on the field before the end of the season.	KELLER RETURNS TO THE MINORS	The Pirates optioned struggling stratng pitcher Mitch Keller to Triple-A Indianapolis on Saturday, hoping the right-hander can rediscover the form that made him the organization’s top prospect.	Keller, 25, has allowed six earned runs in 4 2/3 innings over his last two starts and is 1-4 with a 7.83 ERA over his last six outings.	“Mitch Keller is going to be a good major league pitcher,” Shelton said.	Keller is 5-13 with a 6.31 ERA in 28 starts since making his debut in 2019.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Pirates: Pittsburgh placed LHP Trevor Cahill on the 10-day injured list with a left calf strain. Cahill is 1-5 with a 6.57 ERA in nine appearances (eight starts) this season for the Pirates, who signed him to a one-year deal in mid-March.	Brewers: Along with transferring Shaw to the 60-day injured list, Milwaukee placed outfielder Tyrone Taylor on the 10-day injured list with a strained right shoulder suffered while making a throw during batting practice on Friday.	UP NEXT	Will Crowe (0-4, 7.26 ERA) was recalled from Indianapolis and will start in Cahilll’s place Sunday when the Pirates wrap up their three-game trip to Milwaukee. Right-hander Adrian Houser (4-5, 3.66) gets the nod for Milwaukee.	------	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

NEW YORK -- — Marcus Stroman pitched one-run ball into the seventh inning, Francisco Lindor hit an early two-run homer and the New York Mets beat the slumping San Diego Padres 4-1 Saturday.	Stroman (6-4) pitched 6 1/3 innings, allowing six hits and walking one while tying a season high with eight strikeouts.	He induced two double plays to sure-handed second baseman Luis Guillorme and got eight outs via ground ball. The sinkerballer entered with an NL-best 53.9% grounder rate.	“He was nasty,” Mets manager Luis Rojas said. “Everything was moving the right way. He had good command of his stuff.”	Stroman lasted at least six innings for a career-high seventh straight start and beat San Diego for the second time in seven days. He also allowed a run in 6 2/3 innings Sunday in San Diego, and his teammates gave him a wrestling championship belt awarded to each night's player of the game.	“Just trying to celebrate all victories, all blessings,” Stroman said. “So, I was lucky enough to win pitcher of the game today and this is what we get to rock for the day.”	Stroman took a shutout into the seventh until Fernando Tatis Jr. hit his 18th homer to open the inning.	Tatis moved into a tie with Atlanta outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. for the NL homer lead. He crushed an 0-1 slider over the left field fence, admired his latest homer and did his customary, celebratory stutter step before touching third.	Two batters after Tatis’ drive, Stroman walked Wil Myers and exited to a nice ovation.	Aaron Loup finished the seventh and Seth Lugo struck out Manny Machado with a runner on to end a hitless eighth.	Edwin Díaz converted his 12th save in 13 chances, with Lindor converting the final out at short with an off-balanced throw on a grounder that was deflected by Díaz.	New York allowed three runs or fewer for the 11th straight home game and for the 17th time in 22 home games. It is the Mets’ longest streak since a team-record 14-game streak from May 2-31, 1968, in Hall of Famer Tom Seaver’s second season.	“We knew what we were capable of from the very start,” Stroman said of the Mets’ starters. “So, it’s just of going out there. I think between staff, between players, we have a great combination of guys. There’s so much flow of information happening. We’re sharing ideas, we’re sharing how each other pitches and prepares.”	The Mets clinched their 11th series victory this year and moved eight games over .500 for the first time since the end of 2019. New York also won for the 11th time in 15 games and homered for the 10th time in 12 games.	San Diego matched a season high with its fourth straight loss. The Padres also lost for the 10th time in 13 games.	“As a group and a whole, we’re scuffling a bit,” San Diego manager Jayce Tingler said. “These are the challenges. These are the challenges in the season. Nothing’s going to get easy."	San Diego went hitless in both at-bats with runners in scoring position. The Padres tied the 1996 team record by going a 13th straight game without multiple hits with runners in scoring position.	Lindor homered seven pitches in, hitting a first-pitch fastball from Joe Musgrove (4-6) over the right-center field fence. Jonathan Villar added a solo homer in the eighth.	“It’s a little bit of a relief,” Lindor said of hearing cheers at home. “The first couple of games when I got booed, it felt like I was playing on the road.”	Musgrove allowed three runs and four hits in 6 1/3 innings.	The Mets took a 3-0 lead in the sixth when Lindor walked, advanced to third on Pete Alonso’s single and scored on a groundout by Dominic Smith. Villar reached the second deck in right in the eighth.	TRAINER’S ROOM	PADRES: CF Trent Grisham (left foot contusion) was activated off the injured list after two rehab games with Triple-A El Paso and went 0 for 3. ... OF Brian O’Grady was optioned to El Paso. ... Tingler said C Austin Nola (sprained knee) is experiencing less swelling and better mobility and could increase his baseball activities soon.	METS: An MRI on RHP Jacob deGrom (right flexor tendinitis) came back clean, and he is expected to make his next start Wednesday against the Chicago Cubs. ... 2B Jeff McNeil (hamstring) and OF Michael Conforto (hamstring) ran the bases. McNeil is to start a rehab assignment Sunday. ... RF Billy McKinney (sore right knee) was a late scratch from the starting lineup. An MRI on McKinney came back clean and Rojas said he is day-to-day.

CLEVELAND -- — César Hernández scored on a throwing error by pitcher Paul Sewald in the 10th inning, completing the Cleveland Indians’ rally for a 5-4 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Saturday.	After scoring three times with two outs in the ninth to make it 4-all, Cleveland loaded the bases with no outs in the 10th.	Harold Ramírez hit a comebacker to Sewald (2-2), who threw high and wide of the plate. Catcher Tom Murphy jumped to grab the errant throw, but automatic runner Hernández slid home with the game-winning run.	“There is no way to put a good vibe on the end of that ballgame,” Mariners manager Scott Servais said. “Sewald made a great pitch to tie Ramírez up, but you’ve got to make the plays and execute late."	“That’s as sour a taste as you can get in your mouth when you give away a game like that," he said.	The Indians trailed 4-0 after seven, but got on the board in the eighth when Hernández homered off Kendall Graveman. Seattle lefty Yusei Kikuchi had limited them to three singles over the first seven frames.	Cleveland forced extra innings with three runs in the ninth against closer Rafael Montero, who retired the first two batters. Pinch-hitter Bobby Bradley had an RBI single to make it 4-2 and René Rivera followed with a two-run double off the wall in left.	“In that moment, I just want to make contact,” said Rivera, who saluted the crowd upon reaching second base. “I didn’t know where it was going to land. Honestly, I just hit the ball and started running.”	The Indians’ eighth pitcher of the afternoon, James Karinchak (3-2), worked a perfect 10th for the victory. The Mariners fell to 3-6 on a 10-game, 11-day road trip that concludes Sunday at Progressive Field.	“Sometimes, days like this turn out even better than you hope because everyone is a part of it,” Cleveland manager Terry Francona said. “Even guys who weren’t in the game at the start of it, and there were a lot of them for us today.”	Hank Fraley hit a two-run homer in the third and Dylan Moore had a solo shot in the seventh for Seattle, which went 0 for 14 with runners in scoring position and left 11 on base. Moore had two hits and two RBI in his return from a 22-game absence with a strained left calf.	Kikuchi worked on extended rest after being hit on the right knee with a batted ball on June 5 against the Angels.	Indians starter Triston McKenzie only recorded two outs, walking four, in his shortest appearance in the majors. The right-hander walked the bases loaded, then forced home J.P. Crawford with a free pass to Moore before being pulled.	McKenzie, who was recalled from Triple-A Columbus before the game, leads the AL with 39 walks despite being optioned to the minors three times since May 22. He threw 12 strikes in 32 pitches.	“You win as a team and you lose as a team,” McKenzie said. “We’re a great example of that. Everyone tries to pick each other up when they need it.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Mariners: 1B Evan White (left hip flexor strain) went 1 for 4 with a three-run homer in the first game of his rehabilitation assignment Friday with Triple-A Tacoma. White has been on the 10-day IL since May 14.	Indians: C Austin Hedges (head) was not in the lineup, one day after being struck on the helmet by a pitch from Mariners RHP Justin Dunn. Francona said Hedges “looks terrific and is going to be OK.”	NEXT MAN UP	With Hedges unavailable, C Ryan Lavarnway traveled to Cleveland to join the taxi squad. Starter Roberto Pérez is on the IL with a fractured right ring finger, leaving Rivera as the lone healthy catcher on the roster. 1B Yu Chang is their emergency backup. “Chang said he caught in high school, so that was good enough for me,” Francona said, laughing.	UP NEXT	Mariners: RHP Logan Gilbert (1-2, 4.98 ERA) lost his major league debut to the Indians on May 13, giving up four runs in four innings at T-Mobile Park.	Indians: RHP Shane Bieber (7-3, 2.96 ERA) has won his last three starts, striking out 24 with eight walks and a 1.80 ERA over 20 combined innings.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BOSTON -- — Marcus Semien hit a two-run homer — one of Toronto's three longballs in the fifth inning — to extend his club-record road hitting streak to 25 games, and the Blue Jays rebounded from a tough loss to beat the Boston Red Sox 7-2 on Saturday.	Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Bo Bichette, Cavan Biggio and Reese McGuire also went deep for the Blue Jays, who had dropped four of their last five. They blew a late 5-1 lead and lost 6-5 in Friday’s series opener.	“(Friday) night was a tough loss,” Biggio said. “Definitely a game that we feel like we should have definitely won, a bounce-back win was huge.”	Rafael Devers had an RBI triple for the Red Sox, who had won seven of nine.	Guerrero got Toronto’s offense going early with his major league-leading 20th homer, a two-run shot estimated at 439 feet against Nick Pivetta that left Fenway Park over the Green Monster in the first inning.	“I'm just glad I get to watch it and witness it,” winning pitcher Steven Matz said of Guerrero. “From spring training on, he's just what doing what he's doing. It's been an absolute blast to be on this side with him.”	Bichette sent one even further, belting an estimated 468-foot drive out of Fenway over the Monster, going back to back after Semien’s shot.	Biggio opened the fifth with a drive into the first row of Monster seats.	“That's what they do,” Boston manager Alex Cora said. “They hit the ball out of the ballpark. They're an aggressive ballclub.”	Matz (7-3) held the Red Sox to four hits and a run over 5 2/3 innings, striking out eight with two walks.	“I think my fastball-curveball combo and kind of keeping them off balance with the changeup was how I attacked them today,” he said. “It was good to have that curveball going. It felt good.”	Pivetta (6-2) gave up a season-high six runs and allowed four — a career worst — of the Blue Jays’ homers.	“It just comes down to every home run I gave up, I mislocated the pitch or hung the pitch,” Pivetta said. "It's going to happen. Sometimes you get lucky and the hitter misses it. Today, they hit every single one."	PAY ATTENTION	Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said Guerrero’s outstanding start this season isn’t getting noticed because how poorly the team’s bullpen has been.	Guerrero went 1 for 2, raising his batting average to .338 with 52 RBI.	“Nobody’s talking about it because our bullpen’s struggling,” Montoyo said.	NICE ARM	Red Sox CF Kiké Hernández cut down Joe Panik at the plate, trying to score on a medium-deep fly for an inning-ending double play.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Blue Jays: OF George Springer, who has played just four games this season as he recovers from a quad injury suffered rehabbing an oblique strain, could start a rehab assignment soon. Montoyo said he ran the bases in Fenway on Saturday and was going to take batting practice. Springer signed a $150-million, six-year deal as a free agent during the offseason.	Red Sox: SS Xander Bogaerts, scratched from Friday’s game because of a sore left knee, didn’t play Saturday. “I’m not in a rush with this one because of how important he is,” Cora said. “If we have to stay away from him (Sunday), we will.” ... Hernández was hit on the extended flap of his helmet by a pitch from Anthony Castro in the seventh, but stayed in the game.	UP NEXT	Toronto LHP Robbie Ray (3-2, 3.36 ERA) is set to start Sunday against Boston lefty Martín Pérez (4-3, 3.88). Pérez is coming off his worst start of the season Tuesday, when he gave up six runs in only two innings.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CINCINNATI -- — Wade Miley delivered on the mound and at the plate, Joey Votto had a go-ahead two-run single in the third inning and the Cincinnati Reds beat the slumping Colorado Rockies 10-3 Saturday.	Tyler Naquin had three hits and Miley was one of four Reds with two, including Nick Castellanos, who went into the game leading the majors in hitting at .362 and the National League in slugging percentage at .638.	Votto and Eugenio Suárez also added two hits each for the Reds, who have won nine of 12 since falling a season-high six games below .500 on May 29. They reached .500 at 31-31 for the first time since they were 19-19 on May 16.	“It was important to get over that bit of a hump," Miley said. "We were right around it, just underneath it. It’s great to get back to .500.”	Jesse Winker, right behind Castellanos in the batting race, went hitless but made a spectacular backhand catch while skirting the left-center field wall to rob Garrett Hampson leading off the sixth.	The Rockies have lost each of their road series this season and slipped to 5-26 away from Coors Field, compared to 20-14 at home. Opponents have reached double figures in runs in each of their last three games, and they’ve lost four of five and six of their last eight.	Miley singled twice and drew a leadoff walk in Cincinnati’s two-run sixth inning. The left-hander, who logged his first career no-hitter on May 7, overcame muggy conditions that included a 93-degree gametime temperature to allow six hits and three runs, two earned, with one walk and three strikeouts in seven innings.	“We just couldn't mount a comeback against him," Colorado manager Bub Black said. “He's got an assortment of offspeed stuff, and we couldn't conquer it. He's a different kind of pitcher than what guys see in the modern era.”	Reds manager David Bell was ejected in the fourth inning by plate umpire Marvin Hudson. Bell appeared to be arguing over a foul tip call after a swing by Winker.	“It’s best to keep it between myself and the umpire," Bell said. "I went out to ask a question. I will stop right there.”	Colorado right-hander Germán Márquez tied his career high by allowing 12 hits. He lasted two batters into the sixth, getting roughed up for nine runs, eight earned, with two walks and five strikeouts. He also hit a batter.	The Rockies, with starters Charlie Blackmon, Raimel Tapia and Ryan McMahon held out of the lineup, capitalized on third baseman Suárez’s two-base error to put together a second-inning three-run rally and take a brief 3-2 lead.	ANOTHER RUNG	With his third inning single, Votto broke a tie with Hall of Famer Tony Perez for fifth on the Reds career hits list. Votto has 1,936. Johnny Bench, another Hall of Famer, is next with 2,048.	FARM HAND	Reds SS Kyle Farmer made a diving stop to his left and, from his stomach, shoveled the ball from his glove to second baseman Jonathan India to start an inning-ending double play in the third.	SAFE IN LEFT	Winker signaled “safe” after a member of the grounds crew tripped and fell on his in short left field while retrieving a foul ball.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Rockies: Black said IF-OF Chris Owings is tentatively scheduled to leave on Sunday for a rehab assignment with Triple-A Albuquerque. Owings has been on the 60-day injured list after undergoing surgery to repair a sprained right thumb.	Reds: Suárez was back in the starting lineup after leaving Friday’s game early for treatment on a hand injury he suffered in a cooking accident at home.	UP NEXT	Rockies: RHP Antonio Senzatela (2-6) starts Sunday. He allowed one run in seven innings against the Reds on May 16 at Coors Field in a game Cincinnati ended up winning, 7-6.	Reds: RHP Tony Santillan was promoted from Triple-A Louisville on Saturday to make his major league debut on Sunday.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MINNEAPOLIS -- — Pitching has frequently been failing the Minnesota Twins this season.	Not if José Berríos can help it.	Berríos threw seven commanding innings against the highest-scoring team in the majors, Jorge Polanco had three RBI and the Twins beat the Houston Astros 5-2 on Saturday night.	Polanco homered for the fifth time in 11 games, and Miguel Sanó and Ben Rortvedt each drove in runs with doubles to back Berríos (7-2) in his ninth consecutive start without a loss.	“He was pounding the zone and literally not shying away from the hitters at all,” said Rortvedt, who was behind the plate as Berríos completed at least seven innings for the third time in six turns.	The exuberant and indefatigable right-hander had his fastball hopping, with eight strikeouts against the hardest team to whiff in baseball. The Astros, who lead MLB in batting average, runs and several other offensive measures, managed only five hits and one walk against Berríos, whose 52 wins since the start of the 2017 season are tied for the sixth most in the majors.	“I’m proud of my work. I work so hard to go out there and pitch as many innings as I can. Obviously, when I do what I did tonight, I feel really happy,” said Berríos, who has never been more valuable to the Twins with the injuries and struggles besetting most of the rest of the rotation.	Kyle Tucker and Robel García hit back-to-back home runs in the seventh, but Berríos and the Twins entered with a four-run cushion. Berríos ended four innings with strikeouts, skipping off the mound on his way to the dugout to get the season-high crowd of 18,767 at Target Field going.	“I do that naturally. I don’t want to be a hassle with anybody. Just enjoying my game and having fun out there,” Berríos said.	The fans were just as fired up to jeer Jose Altuve — chanting “Cheater! Cheater! Cheater!” — and the Astros for the sign-stealing scandal, which was revealed after the 2019 season. When the Astros played here in the 2020 postseason, the coronavirus pandemic kept the gates closed.	Taylor Rogers pitched a perfect ninth inning for his sixth save, after Hansel Robles turned in a hitless eighth.	DECISION TIME	Astros starter Luis Garcia (5-4) gave up a career-high four runs in 4 1/3 innings to snap his five-start winning streak, raising the question about whether he'll stay in the rotation.	“We've needed him to go relatively deep in ballgames, and the young man has pitched very well,” manager Dusty Baker said.	Despite Garcia allowing only six runs in 29 innings over his last five turns, Lance McCullers is due back soon from a sore shoulder. Baker said he'd consider a temporary six-man rotation, with 20 games in 20 days. starting on Monday.	“I just want to help the team, if it’s in the reliever role or the starter role. If I deserve it? I don’t know. I just have to do my job,” Garcia said.	RUNNING MAN	One of the runs against Garcia was unearned, thanks to a passed ball by catcher Martín Maldonado on a swinging strike three to start the fifth. Nick Gordon used his speed to reach base on the miscue, then stole second to spark the three-run frame.	Gordon has five steals without being caught, in 10 career games. Maldonado had thrown out seven of 15 attempted stealers entering the night.	“He’s proven that he’s a good, smart, aggressive baserunner with good instincts,” Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: Jason Castro (sore Achilles) started a Triple-A rehab assignment Friday, catching five innings without trouble. “No news is good news,” Baker said.	Twins: CF Byron Buxton (hip strain) and LF/2B/3B Luis Arraez (shoulder strain), among the 12 players on the injured list, each played across the river on Saturday for Triple-A St. Paul with their return to the Twins nearly imminent.	UP NEXT	Astros: LHP Framber Valdez (2-0, 1.47 ERA) pitches Sunday to conclude a nine-game road trip. Valdez pitched five scoreless relief innings against the Twins for the victory in Game 1 of their AL wild-card series last year.	Twins: RHP Michael Pineda (3-3, 3.46 ERA) takes the mound for the matinee and series finale. Pineda is 3-4 with a 5.06 ERA in nine career starts against the Astros.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

WASHINGTON -- — LaMonte Wade Jr. led off the eighth inning with an RBI single that broke a scoreless tie and the San Francisco Giants held on to beat the Washington Nationals 2-1 Saturday to earn a split in the day-night doubleheader.	In the opener, Erick Fedde returned after nearly a month on the COVID-19 injured list and pitched five sharp innings in the Nationals' 2-0 win.	The teams combined for five runs in the doubleheader that was scheduled after Thursday’s rainout.	Held to just one hit in the first seven innings of the second game, the Giants quickly took advantage of the extra-inning rule that starts with a runner on second base.	Wade put San Francisco ahead and he later scored on a single by Wilmer Flores. The Nationals got one run back in the eighth on Starlin Castro’s RBI double but their comeback attempt took a big setback when Victor Robles was caught in a baserunning error after Josh Bell's flyout to center that resulted in a double play.	“Honestly, I thought it was poor,” said Nationals manager Dave Martinez about Robles’ attempt to take second with one out and Castro on third.	“Not a very smart decision."	Giants manager Gabe Kapler said the win probably doesn’t happen without the Robles baserunning blunder but didn’t want to expand on an opponent’s mistake.	“We’ve made our own share of boneheaded mistakes on the bases,” said Kapler.	San Francisco won with three hits. The Nationals’ bats weren’t much better as they mustered just four hits — Trea Turner, Juan Soto, Ryan Zimmerman and Kyle Schwarber combined to go 0 for 13.	Jack McGee (2-2) struck out three in one inning of relief and Caleb Baragar earned his first save. Kyle Finnegan (2-2) took the loss.	Fedde (4-4) last pitched on May 16 and was placed on the COVID-19 list three days later after testing positive. He rejoined the rotation by limiting the Giants to four hits while striking out seven and walking none in the first game.	“When they called me and told me, I was shocked,” Fedde said about his diagnosis.	“Obviously I’m not a scientist, but I was vaccinated and I felt great. I’m more than thankful I didn’t pass it around the team,” he said.	Schwarber hit his sixth career leadoff homer in the first game, connecting for a drive into the second deck in left field. A day after being shut out by San Francisco, Schwarber broke the scoreless string with his 10th home run this season, tied with Turner for the team lead.	The Nationals handed Kevin Gausman (7-1) his first loss this season. Gausman allowed two runs on three hits while striking out four in four innings, and exited with a 1.43 ERA.	Brad Hand pitched a perfect seventh for his 11th save.	The Nationals won with four hits. The Giants got five hits and were shut out for the third time this season and first since April 12.	CROSSING PATHS	In the second game, Yan Gomes caught Jefry Rodriguez’s first start with Washington since he was traded away to Cleveland after the 2018 season. Who was Rodriguez traded for? Well, that would be Gomes.	Rodriguez pitched four scoreless innings, allowing one hit and striking out two with three walks in his first major league appearance since 2019 with Cleveland. Rodriguez re-signed with the Nationals as a free agent after the 2020 season.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Giants: C Curt Casali was activated in between games and played for the first time since May 30 and went 0 for 3. ... San Francisco optioned C Chadwick Tromp to Triple-A Sacramento.	Nationals: Martinez said he talked with Scherzer and that the Nationals ace feels a tick better than he did on Friday after feeling a tweak in his groin area. Scherzer was able to do some exercise and also received treatment on Saturday. … Right-handed reliever Daniel Hudson was placed on the 10-day IL with right elbow inflammation after having an MRI on Friday. The move is retroactive to June 10.	UP NEXT	Giants: RHP Johnny Cueto (4-2, 3.70 ERA) will start the series finale for San Francisco.	Nationals: RHP Joe Ross (2-6, 4.80) will start Sunday for Washington. He’s lost five straight decisions.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO -- — Joc Pederson homered for the third straight game, Sergio Alcántara and Ian Happ also went deep, and the Chicago Cubs used a five-run second inning to beat the St. Louis Cardinals 7-2 on Saturday night.	Kyle Hendricks (8-4) threw six solid innings for his sixth consecutive victory and the Cubs won for the seventh time in 11 games.	Nolan Arenado and Paul DeJong hit home runs for the Cardinals, who have lost 10 of 12 and fell to .500 at 32-32 for the first time since April 28.	John Gant (4-4) lasted 1 2/3 innings to add to St. Louis’ rotation struggles, allowing five runs, five walks and a hit with just one strikeout.	“Made a lot of good defensive plays, took a lot of really quality at-bats, hit the ball hard all over the ballpark. Paul had a nice stroke. Not enough,” manager Mike Shildt said. “I’ve got to figure out a way to make it better. It’s ultimately on my shoulders.”	The Cubs sent 11 batters to the plate in their five-run second. Happ hit a two-run shot to put the Cubs ahead 2-1 before Gant walked the next three batters — including Hendricks. Pederson popped out before Kris Bryant drew the fifth walk of the inning to score a run.	“We’ve done a lot of things that have been positive, but we haven’t been able to overcome this differential in walks and been giving away too much,” Shildt said. “Sometimes it’s been earned and sometimes we pitch around a guy, but there’s been way too many non-competitive ones, too.”	Jake Woodford replaced Gant and allowed an RBI single to Javier Báez before hitting Anthony Rizzo with a pitch to bring in another run.	“It’s just more of the same of what our guys have been doing,” Hendricks said. “They’ve been putting together unbelievable at-bats, going pitch-to-pitch so well. Really, all night, just did a really good job of responding.”	Woodford got his first major league hit — a single off Hendricks — in the next inning after DeJong hit a leadoff homer.	Alcántara added a solo shot off Woodford in the third.	Pederson once again did a stutter step at third base to celebrate homering off Seth Elledge in the fourth, a move he’s copied from Padres star Fernando Tatis Jr.	“When you get our offense to continue to have the at-bats they have, I think we’re never out of a game,” manager David Ross said. “I think we can put up a crooked number pretty fast.”	Arenado hit his 12th homer off Hendricks in the second inning. Hendricks leads the majors with 19 homers allowed. He gave up two runs and three hits.	The Cardinals loaded the bases in the ninth, but Craig Kimbrel took the mound and got a groundout to end the game for his 17th save in 19 chances.	“I don’t think we’re concerned,” DeJong said. “I’m pretty sure we’re just out there playing the game. The Cubs are a good team. This is a wild place to play. We’re just trying to do as much as we can as a group.”	The crowd of 39,095 was larger than Friday’s 35,112, when Wrigley Field opened to full capacity for the first time since Sept. 22, 2019.	ON THE MOVE	Chicago recalled right-hander Trevor Megill (0-0, 0.00 ERA) from Triple-A Iowa and optioned righty Kohl Stewart (1-1, 5.68) to Iowa before the game.	NEW LOOK	The Cubs debuted their dark blue City Connect jerseys with light blue trim, all-caps “Wrigleyville” on the front and designs for Chicago’s 77 neighborhoods.	Ross said he didn’t wear a mask in the dugout because he didn’t have one to match his uniform. He said he was unaware of other Cubs going maskless. Chicago has yet to reach the 85% vaccination threshold for relaxing protocols.	MOVING AROUND	Bryant played his first game at third base since April 20. He has seen time at all outfield positions and first base.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Cardinals: LHP Kwang Hyun Kim (lower back tightness) is expected to throw another bullpen Sunday as he nears a return from the injured list. ... OF Justin Williams (neck stiffness) was set to begin a rehab assignment with Triple-A Memphis. ... RHP Dakota Hudson (Tommy John surgery) has been playing catch and hopes to contribute before the end of the season, Shildt said.	Cubs: INFs David Bote (dislocated left shoulder), Matt Duffy (low back strain) and Nico Hoerner (left hamstring strain) are progressing well, with Duffy likely ahead of the pack, Ross said. ... LHP Justin Steele (right hamstring strain) is close to throwing a bullpen, Ross said.	UP NEXT	RHP Carlos Martínez (3-6, 6.21 ERA) will start Sunday’s series finale for the Cardinals against RHP Zach Davies (3-3, 4.45). Martínez has allowed 15 runs in 4 2/3 innings over his last two starts. Davies has given up five runs in his previous 20 1/3 innings.	----	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

LOS ANGELES -- — The Texas Rangers thought it was quite appropriate to end their epic road losing streak with one of their most impressive victories of the season.	These rebuilding Rangers are all about new beginnings, and they got a big one at Dodger Stadium during their first road victory since May 6.	“We’ve got a new streak,” Texas manager Chris Woodward said. “We’re hoping to build off that one.”	Jonah Heim and Nate Lowe had two-run homers among their three hits apiece, and the Rangers emphatically snapped their 16-game road losing skid with a 12-1 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Saturday night.	Jason Martin hit his first major league homer and Willie Calhoun had an RBI triple for the Rangers, who were mired in a slump outside of Arlington that spanned six ballparks and matched the longest road losing streak in franchise history, set by the expansion Washington Senators in 1961.	It was also the AL's longest road losing streak since 2010, and the longest within a single season since 1970.	“It’s huge,” said Heim, who also doubled and singled to end his 0-for-13 slump. “Whenever you can get in the win column in the big leagues, it’s always a good day. We’re just excited we played a full team game today.”	Kolby Allard pitched five scoreless innings of five-hit ball for last-place Texas, which improbably dominated the defending World Series champions and won for just the third time in 16 games overall — one night after taking a 12-1 loss of its own at Chavez Ravine.	Isiah Kiner-Falefa extended his hitting streak to 10 games with three hits and also stole three bases for the Rangers, who had scored only 18 runs in their previous eight road games.	Texas battered NL Cy Young Award winner Trevor Bauer (6-5) for nine hits and six runs — both season highs for the Dodgers' new starter.	“I was a little bit shaky early on, fighting my command a little bit, and then I think I actually threw the ball pretty well,” Bauer said. “As the season goes on, you’re going to have outings like this. Things aren’t always going to go your way.”	Bauer struck out eight and got his first hit for the Dodgers, but also took his first back-to-back losses of the season. He yielded two unearned runs in the third on a rally that started with Mookie Betts dropping a fly ball in center. Heim then homered off Bauer in the fourth.	“I’m not concerned about it,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said of Bauer's recent suboptimal performances. “I think it just comes down to making pitches.”	AJ Pollock homered for the Dodgers, whose five-game winning streak ended with just their second loss in 10 games. Los Angeles' 12 runs and 17 hits allowed were its worst totals of the season.	Allard (2-2) was outstanding in the third start of the season for the Anaheim-born graduate of San Clemente High School, striking out four with just one walk. Allard, who got zero runs of support in his first two starts, escaped a bases-loaded jam in the fourth by getting rookie Zach McKinstry on a weak first-pitch grounder.	“A W is a W, but it was obviously cool,” Allard said. “I had a lot of family and friends in the stands.”	NOW THAT'S A DEBUT	Andy Burns, a 30-year-old outfielder, got his first major league hit and then pitched in the ninth inning of his debut game with the Dodgers.	After being recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma City before the game, Burns got an infield single in the second inning of his first major league start. He also drew a walk.	And with the Dodgers down 10-1 in the ninth, Burns even got to pitch. He got three outs, but also gave up three hits, including a two-run homer by Martin, another Orange County native.	Roberts said he surprised Burns by putting him on the mound in the ninth. Burns doesn't appear to have any significant pitching experience at any level of his well-traveled career.	“I just felt that I didn't want to get the anxiety or the nerves with the anticipation of that ninth inning,” Roberts said. “I just asked him if he was ready to make history, and he said, ‘Let’s do it.'”	Burns had his only six previous games of major league experience as a reserve with Toronto in 2016. He has played all across the minors and in South Korea and Australia over the past 11 years.	THEY WERE DUE	The Rangers improved to 2-10 against NL teams and won at an NL park for the first time in 12 games while beating the Dodgers for only the second time in 10 meetings since June 2015.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: 1B Max Muncy went on the injured list with a right oblique muscle strain after homering in the first inning of Friday's game and then getting pulled in the second. ... OF Cody Bellinger didn't play after leaving Friday's game with left hamstring tightness. Manager Dave Roberts doesn't think the injury is serious.	UP NEXT	Walker Buehler (5-0, 2.56) takes the mound for Los Angeles after throwing seven scoreless innings of two-hit ball in Pittsburgh on Tuesday. Dane Dunning (2-4, 4.26) counters for the Rangers.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PHILADELPHIA -- — Aaron Nola allowed three hits and struck out nine, leading Philadelphia over the New York Yankees 7-0 Sunday for a two-game sweep that moved the Phillies back over .500.	Odubel Herrera, Jean Segura and J.T. Realmuto combined to go 7 for 13 with a double, a triple, four runs scored and five RBI. Philadelphia has won four straight games and three straight series during a 6-1 homestand, giving the Phillies a winning record for the first time since they were 22-21 before play on May 20.	“We have a team that can be an all-around, really good team,” said Andrew McCutchen, who was 2 for 3 with a run and two RBI. “We can hit, we can pitch and we can field. We can be that type of team.”	Domingo Germán (4-4) fell behind 4-0 by the second inning, a day after Jameson Taillon trailed 4-0 in the first.	The Yankees have lost seven of nine and 13 of 18. They are in fourth place, 8 1/2 games behind AL East-leading Tampa Bay, their largest deficit since September 2018, and at 32-31 are one game above .500 for the first time since they were 17-16.	“We’re going to find out what kind of character we’re made of,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. “We’re clearly in the mist of incredibly tough times. We’ve faced it throughout this season. And we’re going to find out what we’re made of and what kind of team we are. We need to step it up, period.”	When asked if he felt there was anyone who was getting used to or accepting the team's struggles, Boone bristled when answering no. “I know them too well and I don’t think there’s any getting used to ... losing,” Boone said. “Get out of here with that.”	The Yankees grounded into their major league-high 64th double play. Rougned Odor was caught off second base on Gleyber Torres’ seventh-inning grounder to shortstop, the Yankees 31st runner out on the bases this season. No other team started the day with more than 23.	“We’re grinding over this as much as we can in conversations postgame,” Boone said. “We’ve addressed some things and changed along the way, and we’re going to keep doing that.”	Nola (5-4) had been 1/3 with a 5.68 and .299 opponents’ batting average in his previous six starts. He allowed two singles to DJ LeMahieu and a double to Odor.	Nola walked one, throwing 103 pitches in 7 2/3 innings while possessing sharper fastball command than he exhibited recently.	“I always have my confidence,” Nola said. “I just had some things not going my way. It was frustrating not getting out fifth inning three of the last four. To myself, that’s not what I usually do. I want to go deep into games and put my team in a position to win. Not having the command that I’m used to having is frustrating. But it doesn’t keep me from keep working on in throwing sessions and bullpen sessions. And I always go into the next game with confidence.”	Phillies manager Joe Girardi shuffled his rotation to keep Nola on four days' rest despite two off days last week. Nola had six days off before his previous start.	“He wasn’t getting on the mound enough," Girardi said. "We’re trying to be proactive here because we worry about the back end. But there are times when a guy gets out of his rhythm. He tweaked a few things.”	New York, missing Aaron Judge due to back spasms, finished with four hits against Nola, relievers Connor Brogdon and Enyel De Los Santos.	The Yankees were shut out for the third time this season, and the Phillies pitched their fifth shutout.	LeMahieu became the fourth-fastest Yankee to 100 multihit games, his 256 games trailing only Joe DiMaggio (208), Mickey Ricers (250) and Bob Meusel (255).	Germán allowed seven runs and 10 hits in 4 1/3 innings. The Phillies went 4 for 7 with two doubles against his curveball.	Germán and Taillon combined to last just 4 2/3 innings in the series, allowing 15 hits and 11 earned runs, for a 21.22 ERA.	Segura had three hits and became the first Phillies player since 1953 with three or more hits and two or more RBI in three straight games. He is hitting .424 with seven RBI in June, raising his average to .339	Rhys Hoskins was 0 for 4 and is hitless in 26 at-bats.	Realmuto singled in the opening run in the first, and Herrera’s RBI double and Segura’s two-run single built the 4-0 lead.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Yankees: Judge experiencing back spasms while going 1 for 5 Saturday. Boone said post-game that he was unavailable even for pinch-hitting duties and will undergo off-day treatment on Monday. ... Boone said he had not received the results of the MRI on the right groin RHP Luis Severino injured Saturday while pitching for High-A Hudson Valley. ... INF Luke Voit (left oblique strain) began a rehab assignment with Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes Barre and went 1 for 3 with a double off Buffalo’s Anthony Kay.	Phillies: Girardi said SS Didi Gregorius experienced “a little stiffness and soreness” in his injured right elbow that stopped his rehab assignment with Triple A Lehigh Valley. “We’re working on that and hope he’s in the lineup soon,” Girardi said. Gregorius has been out since May 12.	UP NEXT	Yankees: LHP Jordan Montgomery (3-1) starts Tuesday’s series opener against Toronto in Buffalo, N.Y.

WASHINGTON -- — Kyle Schwarber became the sixth player in the history of the Washington Nationals and Montreal Expos franchise to homer in both the first and second innings, driving in four runs in a 5-0 win over the San Francisco Giants on Sunday.	Joe Ross allowed five hits in eight innings as the Nationals gained a four-game split.	Schwarber hit his seventh career leadoff homer, his second in as many days, and hit a three-run drive in the second off Johnny Cueto (4-3) for a 4-0 lead. The pitch he hit for second home run was 4.19 feet above the plate, according to MLB Statcast, the highest pitch hit for a home run by Nationals/Expos player since pitch-tracking began in 2008.	“Luck I guess,” Schwarber joked when asked about his success over the weekend after being put in the leadoff spot.	“It’s just another spot in the order," he said. "I think it’s just going up there and trying to take a normal at-bat. It’s not like I hadn’t led off an inning before.”	He joined Ron LeFlore (1980), Wil Cordero (1995), Moises Alou (1996), Mark Grudzielanek (1998) and Bryce Harper (2017 and 2018) in homering in each of the first two innings for the Nationals/Expos franchise.	Schwarber had his ninth multihomer game and first since Aug. 30, 2020, for the Chicago Cubs at Cincinnati. He leads the Nationals with 12 homers.	Josh Harrison had four hits and scored a run for Washington, which had scored three runs in the first three games of the series.	Ross (3-6) struck out a season-high nine and walked none, retiring 13 in a row after Mike Yastrzemski’s first-inning double. Ross had been 0-5 in his previous seven starts.	He became the first pitcher to throw more than seven innings against the Giants this season.	“I felt pretty good commanding the ball,” Ross said after improving to 13-0 in 14 starts when he pitches at least seven innings. “I’m just glad I gave the bullpen a little more rest today.”	Sam Clay pitched a 1-2-3 ninth, finishing the Nationals’ sixth shutout this season. The Giants were blanked for the fourth time, the second in the series.	San Francisco entered with 13 wins in its previous 16 road games but had three runs and 17 hits in the series.	“It extends beyond today’s game,” Giants manager Gabe Kapler said of his club’s offensive struggles. “This entire series hasn’t been our best offensive performance. I think we have a higher level of competitiveness in us.”	Cueto gave up five runs — four earned — nine hits and three walks in 5 1/3 innings.	SACRIFICES	Ross laid down three sacrifice bunts which matched Gio Gonzalez on May 2, 2015, against the Mets for the most since the franchise started in Washington in 2005.	ROSTER MOVE	San Francisco optioned lefty reliever Caleb Baragar to Triple-A Sacramento. The 27-year-old is 2-1 with a 0.49 ERA in 22 appearances this season and earned his first career save in the Giants’ 2-1 win in the second game of Saturday’s doubleheader.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Giants: Cueto was shaken up attempting to field a Victor Robles bunt in the second but stayed in the game.	Nationals: Manager Dave Martinez said that RHP Stephen Strasburg (neck) will have a follow-up appointment with a specialist this week. Martinez said the Nationals are waiting for Strasburg’s nerve irritation to subside before having him begin throwing. ... RHP Max Scherzer, who injured his groin on Friday, played catch in the outfield before Sunday’s game. Martinez said Scherzer is scheduled for a bullpen session Monday, the results of which will determine if he takes his next scheduled turn in the rotation on June 16.	UP NEXT	Giants: RHP Alex Wood (5-3, 3.79 ERA) will start Monday’s series opener at home against Arizona.	Nationals: LHP Jon Lester (0-2, 4.19 ERA) is 13-6 with a 3.17 ERA in 26 starts against Pittsburgh going into Monday’s series opener.	------	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

MIAMI -- — For his 32nd birthday, Drew Smyly got the following: an early lead, a big day from Austin Riley and some nifty defense from Ehire Adrianza.	And the Atlanta Braves held on for a needed win.	Riley homered and drove in three runs, Smyly allowed two runs over five innings and the Braves snapped a four-game slide by beating the Miami Marlins 6-4 on Sunday.	“Anytime you get a win, it's a good feeling," Smyly said. “They're not easy. They just don't hand them out to teams. They're always a grind. ... This team has had a lot of ups and downs, but we know what we're capable of doing."	Riley reached base five times, going 3 for 3 with a walk and getting hit by a pitch. Ender Inciarte also homered for Atlanta, his solo shot coming one inning after he entered the game as an injury replacement for Ronald Acuña Jr., who departed with what the Braves said was right pectoral soreness.	“I don't see this being lingering," Braves manager Brian Snitker said.	Starling Marte drove in three runs for the Marlins, who were bidding for their first sweep of Atlanta since 2016. Right-hander Pablo López (2-4) went only three innings, giving up four runs and six hits and seeing his ERA rise from 2.76 to 3.12.	“The Braves had a plan," López said, “and they executed it really well."	Smyly (3-3) almost got his first career RBI, in his 43rd plate appearance. He lofted a liner to center with one out in the fifth; Marte caught it, then fired home — and even after an awkward skip off the grass, Miami catcher Jorge Alfaro handed the throw and tagged out Adrianza to end the inning.	Adrianza made up for that a half-inning later.	The Marlins got two runs in the fifth off Smyly, with Marte getting an RBI single and later scoring on a wild pitch. But Smyly escaped the inning and became eligible for the birthday win when Adrianza fielded a high chopper to shortstop off the bat of Miami’s Corey Dickerson and flipped it from his glove to first in time for the third out.	Miami got a two-run single from Marte in the seventh, and he kept the Marlins within two runs with a sensational running grab to save a run and retire Kevan Smith to end the Atlanta ninth.	“He tried to keep us in the game today," Marlins manager Don Mattingly said of Marte.	But Will Smith retired the Marlins in the ninth in order, getting his 12th save and ending a three-hour, 45-minute contest.	The Braves had a total of three first-inning runs in their last 10 games. They got three on Sunday alone; Acuña Jr. extended the longest active on-base streak in the majors to 22 games with a bloop single to left to open the game, and Riley had the big hit with a two-run single.	“López had a really long inning," Smyly said.	It was López’s 14th start of the season. Against anyone other than Atlanta in the first inning, his ERA is 0.75. In two starts against the Braves, his first-inning ERA: 27.00, after giving up three runs each time.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Braves: SS Dansby Swanson, who had been Atlanta’s only player to start each of the season’s first 62 games, wasn’t in the lineup — then entered as a pinch-hitter in the eighth inning. ... OF Guillermo Heredia got his fingers pinned between the ball and his bat as he tried to bunt in the eighth inning.	Marlins: The Marlins activated LHP Trevor Rogers (7-3, 2.02) from the 10-day injured list, only one day after putting him on that list -- the indicator being a coronavirus-related concern. RHP Preston Guilmet, whose contract was selected so he could take Rogers’ spot for a day, was designated for assignment. Rogers pitches Tuesday in St. Louis. ... INF Jose Devers left Sunday with right shoulder discomfort.	BIRTHDAY NUMBERS	It was the 51st time in Braves history that their starting pitcher was celebrating a birthday. The Braves are now 25-26 in those games, which include a loss on Ian Anderson’s 23rd birthday — a 7-2 defeat by Toronto on May 2.	Smyly is the fifth pitcher to start on his birthday this season in the majors. Anderson and Pittsburgh’s Mitch Keller took losses; Houston’s Jose Urquidy and Milwaukee’s Freddy Peralta got wins.	BRAVO	In games where it led at any point by at least three runs, Atlanta started 1-3. The Braves are 22-2 in those games since.	UP NEXT	Braves: Off Monday, then play host to the Boston Red Sox on Tuesday in the opener of a two-game series. LHP Tucker Davidson (0-0, 1.53) starts for Atlanta.	Marlins: LHP Braxton Garrett (0-1, 6.43) starts for Miami on Monday in the opener of a series at St. Louis against RHP Adam Wainwright (4-5, 4.03).	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- — Randy Arozarena hit his first career grand slam, Tampa Bay relievers threw seven no-hit innings, and the Rays handed the Baltimore Orioles their 15th consecutive road loss, 7-1 on Sunday.	The Orioles extended a dubious team record, the worst road skid since the club moved from St. Louis to Baltimore in 1954.	Arozarena made it 7-1 when he stopped a personal 19-game home run drought on his drive to center off César Valdez in the seventh.	“I'm very happy, especially for me to hit that ball out and I know for the team,” Arozarena said through an interpreter. “We're out here trying to get the wins, and luckily we are. We're a good team. We're a first-place team now."	After opener Michael Wacha allowed one run and two hits, Josh Fleming (6-4) entered in the third and walked one — with two outs in the third that was the last Orioles' baserunner — over four innings.	“That's us, pitching and trying to prevent runs," Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash said. “That is what puts us in a position to where we have a chance to be special. Right now we're getting a lot of big hits."	Matt Wisler, Andrew Kittredge and Jeffrey Springs all worked one perfect inning.	“We're the best bullpen, I think, in the league, ” Fleming said. “They're going to get it done.”	Tampa Bay relievers have an AL-best 3.05 ERA, including 1.59 over the past 17 games. Overall, the Rays have held opponents to three or fewer runs 39 times.	Taylor Walls drove in two runs as Tampa Bay, with the majors' best record at 42-24, improved to 23-5 since May 13.	“Wins help. I think this group came into spring training feeling pretty confident about themselves and we want it to continue,” Cash said.	Walls had a two-run single against Bruce Zimmermann (4-4) during the fourth as Tampa Bay took a 3-1 lead. The rookie, who started the game with one hit in his previous 15 at-bats, singled and stole second in the third before scoring on Yandy Díaz’s single.	Zimmermann gave up three runs and six hits in 5 ⅔ innings, and had his career-high three-game winning streak end.	Pat Valaika put the Orioles ahead 1-0 on a second-inning RBI single off Wacha.	Baltimore is 0-6 against the Rays this season, getting outscored 48-21.	The Orioles were swept for the seventh time this season and have an AL-worst record of 22-42.	“We have to keep playing, keep our heads up,” Baltimore shortstop Freddy Galvis said, “That's it, man.”	WINDY CITY SHOWDOWN	The teams with the best two records in the AL meet Monday night in Chicago when the Rays take on the White Sox.	“It should be a very fun series,” Cash said. “They’re a talented team. You kind of saw it coming over the last couple seasons. You saw the youth that they had, and now those guys have evolved. They added some big pieces. Their pitching has been tremendous.”	FUTILITY	Orioles 3B Maikel Franco was hitless in three at-bats and is 0 for 24 against the Rays this season. DH Ryan Mountcastle and CF Austin Hays are both 2 for 22 in the season series.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Orioles: CF Cedric Mullins had a scheduled day off. … 1B Trey Mancini was hit around the right elbow by a pitch in the first but stayed in the game.	Rays: 1B Ji-Man Choi (strained left groin) could return on Monday.	UP NEXT	Orioles: Manager Brandon Hyde said a pitcher will probably be called up from Triple-A Norfolk to start Monday night’s game at Cleveland. The Indians are going with RHP J.C. Mejía (1-1).	Rays: RHP Tyler Glasnow (5-2) and White Sox RHP Lance Lynn (7-1) are Monday night’s starters.	------	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

DETROIT -- — Carlos Rodón took a no-hitter into the seventh inning, and the Chicago White Sox completed a three-game sweep of the Detroit Tigers with a 4-1 win on Sunday.	Rodón (6-2) was going for his second no-hitter of the season. He took a perfect game into the ninth inning against the Cleveland Indians on April 14, hitting a batter with one out before finishing the no-no.	The Tigers didn’t come close to a hit until Eric Haase’s deep fly fell just past left fielder Andrew Vaughn’s glove for a double with one out in the seventh.	“I left a slider over the plate and he put a good swing on it,” Rodón said. “I thought Andrew had made the catch, and I think Haase did too, but he just missed it. Left field is huge here, and he couldn't have done anything else to get there.”	Rodón finished the inning, allowing one run on one hit and two walks while striking out nine. Evan Marshall and Liam Hendriks completed the one-hitter, with Hendriks getting his AL-leading 17th save.	The last visiting pitcher to throw a no-hitter at Detroit was the Angels' Nolan Ryan on July 15, 1973.	The Tigers used six pitchers on a bullpen day, one day after using catcher Jake Rogers and infielder Harold Castro to pitch the final two innings of a 15-2 loss.	The White Sox took a 1-0 lead in the fourth inning on Jose Abreu’s RBI single off Tyler Alexander (0-1), and Leury Garcia made it 2-0 in the fifth with a run-scoring double.	Buck Farmer, called up from Triple-A Toledo before the game, hit Danny Mendick with the bases loaded in the sixth, then walked Garcia to make it 4-0.	“We were hoping to get more than one inning from Buck, but he used up a lot of pitches getting out of his own jam,” Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said.	Haase took third on a wild pitch after his double and scored on Niko Goodrum's sacrifice fly.	“That was a tough spot, because we all know what was happening,” Haase said. “He was dominating and really grinding us down. Even my hit was more of a one-handed swing that just got past a glove.”	Rodón and catcher Zack Collins thought they had struck out Hasse out on a 2-2 slider, but plate umpire Pat Hoberg called it a ball.	“Pat's one of the best umpires in the game,” Rodón said. “If he missed one, it means he's human. It just wasn't meant to be today.”	MOVES	The Tigers selected Farmer from Triple-A Toledo to replace Beau Burrows, who was optioned after allowing four runs and vomiting on the mound in Saturday's lopsided loss.	VERLANDER STANDS ALONE	Justin Verlander has the only no-hitter in Comerica Park's 22 seasons, blanking the Milwaukee Brewers on June 12, 2007 for the first of his three career no-hitters.	The stadium did host one of the most famous near-misses in baseball history. Armando Galarraga lost a perfect game against the Cleveland Indians on June 2, 2010, when first base umpire Jim Joyce incorrectly called Jason Donald safe with two outs in the ninth.	UP NEXT	White Sox: The AL Central leaders return home on Monday to start a three-game series with the AL East-leading Tampa Bay Rays. Lance Lynn (7-1, 1.23 ERA) is scheduled to start the opener against Tampa Bay's Tyler Glasnow (5-2, 2.57).	Tigers: Head west for a three-game series against the Kansas City Royals. Matthew Boyd (3-6, 3.56) is scheduled to start Monday's opener against Brad Keller (6-5, 5.75).	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CINCINNATI -- — Eugenio Suárez hit an early two-run homer and the surging Cincinnati Reds climbed back over .500 for the first time since April 21, beating the Colorado Rockies 6-2 Sunday.	The Reds have won 10 of their last 13, including three straight over the Rockies. It was the Reds' first sweep of Colorado in Cincinnati since 2006.	“It was a great series," Reds manager David Bell said. "A lot of great things happened — offense, bullpen and starting pitching.”	Tony Santillan, recalled from Triple-A Louisville on Saturday to make his major league debut while filling in for injured Sonny Gray, fell one out short of qualifying for the win. The 24-year-old right-hander allowed one run on five hits and four walks in 4 2/3 innings, striking out five.	Santillan needed 97 pitches to get 14 outs, leaving with the bases loaded and rain falling. He also hit two batters.	“It wasn’t a pretty line, but I battled out of tough situations," Santillan said. "I can be happy and build off that.”	Ryan Hendrix, the first of five Reds relievers, came in and struck out Dom Nuñez swinging on a ball in the dirt blocked by Gold Glove catcher Tucker Barnhart.	“It’s nice having Tucker back there," said Hendrix (3-1), who got credit for the win. "He blocks everything.”	Barnhart helped Santillan escape a second-inning jam, hustling around the plate umpire to make a sliding catch of pitcher Antonio Senzatela’s popped-up bunt near Colorado’s on-deck circle with runners on first and third and one out.	The Rockies stranded 10 runners in the first five innings, twice leaving the bases loaded, on the way to their fourth straight loss and seventh in their last nine. They left 12 runners on in the game and were swept on the road for the fifth time this season.	Colorado fell to 5-27 on the road, on pace to break the worst road record in major league history, the 13-65 mark by the 1935 Boston Braves. The Rockies are hitting a big league-worst .201 on the road and a major league-high .277 at home.	Suárez followed Joey Votto’s RBI single in the second with his 14th homer of the season, a drive that left fielder Raimel Tapia watched sail into the stands after just two steps.	Senzatela (2-7) lasted two batters into the seventh inning, leaving after Shogo Akiyama’s pinch-hit double off the right field wall put runners at second and third. Jesse Winker had a two-run double in the inning.	The Rockies needed just four pitches from Santillan to take a 1-0 lead. Tapia singled on the second pitch, Yonathan Daza hit the next pitch to right for a ground-rule double and Charlie Blackmon delivered a sacrifice fly on his first pitch.	Santillan regrouped to strike out Trevor Story looking and coax Ryan McMahon into an inning-ending flyout.	“We had multiple opportunities to get a big hit," Colorado manager Bud Black said. "What’d we leave, 12 or 13 guys on base? (Senzatela) did his job. I thought, for the most part, his stuff was good. He threw the ball fine. We had a couple of opportunities. We just couldn’t break through.”	McMahon added his 15th homer in the seventh.	BALANCED ATTACK	Every Reds starter except Barnhart finished with one hit.	RARE SWEEP	The last time time the Reds swept Colorado at all was July 27-29, 2012, at Coors Field.	FORGETTABLE	Story struck out four times, the first two times with runners in scoring position in the first and third innings.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Rockies: Santillan hit both Daza and Story with pitches — Daza in the right biceps in the third and Story in the back of the upper left arm in the fifth. Both stayed in the game.	Reds: OF Aristides Aquino was activated from the 60-day IL after recovering from surgery to remove his left hamate bone. OF Nick Senzel (left knee inflammation, surgery) was transferred from the 10-day to the 60-day IL.	UP NEXT	Rockies: Colorado hosts San Diego. LHP Austin Gomber (5-5) is 3-1 with a 1.57 ERA, three walks and 37 strikeouts over his last six starts since May 13.	Reds: Cincinnati visits the Brewers on Monday. RHP Vladimir Gutierrez (2-1) limited Milwaukee to six hits and two runs in last start on Wednesday.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

NEW YORK -- — Starving for a clutch hit, the San Diego Padres got two in a row from precisely the guys you'd expect.	Can't hold down Fernando Tatis Jr. and Manny Machado forever.	Tatis hit a tiebreaking grand slam in the seventh inning and Machado followed with a home run as San Diego's high-priced superstars powered the Padres past the New York Mets 7-3 on Sunday to stop a four-game slide.	“There were a lot of big moments," manager Jayce Tingler said. “Obviously we’ve been fighting, scrapping, clawing and struggling at the same time.”	Tommy Pham launched a leadoff homer and Chris Paddack (3-5) struck out a season-high nine over six strong innings to help San Diego prevent a weekend sweep despite grounding into four double plays.	“One of his best starts. He was really efficient with his pitches,” Tingler said.	Shut down by New York's stingy staff in the first two games of the series and struggling mightily with runners in scoring position lately, the Padres finally broke through against the Mets' bullpen.	San Diego drew three walks in the seventh from a tiring Jeurys Familia (2-1), who had pinch-hitter Jurickson Profar down 1-2 before losing him with two outs. Familia then walked Pham on four straight balls, forcing in the tying run, and was pulled after throwing 41 pitches over 1 2/3 innings.	“He's gotten a lot of big outs in his career. We felt like he could come out of there,” said Mets manager Luis Rojas, who was operating short-handed down several relievers in a taxed bullpen, plus two players on the bench who were unavailable. “It was a tough one.”	Jacob Barnes wanted a borderline 1-1 pitch to Tatis but didn't get it, and the $341 million slugger sent the next one a projected 444 feet to left field for his third career slam and second this season.	“It was huge. It was a great inning from the entire offense,” Tatis said.	It was the 19th homer of the year in 49 games for the 22-year-old Tatis, who also went deep in a 4-1 loss Saturday. He began the day tied with Atlanta outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. for the National League lead.	Tatis matched Harmon Killebrew in 1959 and Cody Bellinger in 2017 for the most home runs in the first 49 games by a player 22 or younger.	“He's an unbelievable player. He's got all the tools,” Rojas said. “He showed everything, right? ... This kid can beat you in different ways. Special player.”	Machado, the Padres' $300 million third baseman, connected for his ninth of the season to make it 7-2.	“It was awesome. I was on the rail just fired up,” Paddack said.	San Diego had dropped 10 of 13 overall. The Padres have gone 14 games without getting multiple hits with runners in scoring position, a club record.	Paddack gave up six hits and walked none in his first win since May 21. José Peraza put the Mets ahead 2-1 with a two-run homer in the fifth.	“Basically, I just wanted to attack these hitters,” Paddack said. “We were on a four-game losing streak. I wanted to be that guy that stops it and get us in the win column.”	New York starter Joey Lucchesi allowed one run and struck out six against his former team in a season-high five innings.	The Mets fell to 17-6 at Citi Field and permitted more than three runs for the first time in 12 home games.	LOOK OUT!	Pete Alonso was hit on the bill of his helmet by a 94 mph fastball from Padres reliever Emilio Pagán in the eighth, sending the headgear flying and leaving Pagán with his hands on his head. Alonso, however, popped right up and appeared to be fine. He went to first base and stayed in the game.	NOBODY LEFT	Mets reliever Robert Gsellman struck out as a pinch-hitter against closer Mark Melancon to end the game.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Mets: RHP Jacob deGrom remains on track to make his next scheduled start Wednesday, Rojas said. The two-time Cy Young Award winner left Friday's outing with right flexor tendinitis, but an MRI came back clean. ... 2B Jeff McNeil (strained left hamstring) went 0 for 2 with High-A Brooklyn in his first rehab game. He played five innings at second base. ... RF Michael Conforto (strained right hamstring) looked really good running the bases at about 95-100% on Saturday and could begin a rehab assignment by the end of the week, Rojas said. ... OF Billy McKinney (sore right knee) sat out for the second consecutive game but is expected to start Monday night, Rojas said before the game. ... RHP Miguel Castro developed his stiff neck sleeping on the plane. Castro wasn't available but is feeling better, according to Rojas. “I don't think it's going to be that long,” he said. ... RHP Dellin Betances, on the 60-day injured list since April 8 with a right shoulder impingement, began a rehab assignment with Low-A St. Lucie. He had two strikeouts and a walk in a hitless inning of relief. ... 3B Jonathan Villar did not start because he was dealing with a family matter, Rojas said.	UP NEXT	Padres: RHP Dinelson Lamet (1-1, 3.52 ERA) starts Monday night in Colorado as prized rookie LHP Ryan Weathers (3-2, 2.44) moves to the bullpen. “It's not necessarily permanent,” Tingler said. “I think it's best for the team right now. ...

CLEVELAND -- — Jake Fraley homered off AL Cy Young Award winner Shane Bieber after replacing the injured Mitch Haniger, and the Seattle Mariners beat the Cleveland Indians 6-2 on Sunday.	The Mariners, coming off a blown late lead and a 10-inning loss on Saturday, had to deal with more bad news two batters into the game when Haniger fouled a pitch off his left knee and had to be helped from the field.	Mariners manager Scott Servais said X-rays showed a deep bone bruise and Haniger will likely have more tests on Monday with the team back in Seattle. The injury is another setback for the Mariners, who have used a major-league high 51 players this season. Haniger leads the team in homers and RBI.	J.P. Crawford, who singled and stole second to begin the game, had a clear view of Haniger's at-bat.	“I just knew,” Crawford said. “It didn't look good. I felt bad for him, but we need him. Hopefully he gets back sooner than later.”	Fraley completed the at-bat with a strikeout and flied out in the second, but his two-run homer in the fourth pushed Seattle's lead to 5-0. Kyle Seager hit a solo homer in the third off Bieber, who gave up five runs in 5 2/3 innings.	Seattle has beaten Bieber twice this season, scoring eight runs on 15 hits in 10 1/3 innings, but Seager doesn't believe the Mariners have figured him out.	“He's a tough pitcher,” Seager said. “The curveball is so tight. It's so hard. He's that good for a reason. We had some really good at-bats. We really battled him and worked. It was a good offensive performance by us.”	Logan Gilbert (2-2) outpitched Cleveland's ace, allowing one run and four hits in 6 2/3 innings. The right-hander was removed after Harold Ramirez's two-out single in the seventh.	Bieber (7-4) gave up 10 hits, struck out eight and walked two. He retired the side in order only once and threw 107 pitches.	“Today, I got beat for not executing,” Bieber said. “That’s obvious. Whether it’s curveball, fastball, slider, changeup, cutter, it doesn’t really matter. I just got to be better and continue to hit spots, execute throughout the game, strike one, two and three and then continue momentum.”	Bieber and Aaron Civale have had to carry the load for Cleveland’s rotation, which has been plagued by injuries and inexperience.	The Indians optioned right-hander Triston McKenzie to Triple-A Columbus before the game. Zach Plesac, who sustained a broken right thumb after angrily removing his shirt following a rough outing, is playing catch but there's no timetable for his return.	Servais said Saturday's 5-4 loss — in which closer Rafael Montero couldn't hold a 4-1 lead after retiring the first two batters in the ninth — left a sour taste in his mouth. Gilbert's strong outing and the home runs were much sweeter.	“To go out there and shut them down like he did is exactly what we needed,” Servais said.	José Godoy and Crawford had run-scoring singles in the second for Seattle, which went 4-6 on an 11-day trip. Crawford and Seager each had three hits while Jake Bauers, acquired from Cleveland on Thursday, had two hits and an RBI.	Amed Rosario had an RBI single in the sixth for Cleveland. The Indians loaded the bases with two outs in the ninth off Kendall Graveman and scored a run on a wild pitch, but Josh Naylor lined to Fraley in left field to end the game.	Graveman was making his second appearance since being activated after a COVID-19 scare.	Haniger, who has 16 home runs and 40 RBI, was struck squarely on the knee by the foul ball and went to the ground immediately. He slowly got to his feet and was assisted off the field by Servais and a trainer.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Indians: OF Jordan Luplow is still bothered by a sprained left ankle, ending his rehab assignment at Triple-A Columbus. President of baseball operations Chris Antonetti said Luplow will be rechecked by doctors and could get another opinion. Luplow has been on the injured list since May 28.	UP NEXT	Mariners: LHP Marco Gonzales (1-4, 5.45 ERA) will start the opener of a three-game home series against Minnesota on Monday night.	Indians: RHP J.C. Mejia (1-1, 4.15) will pitch the opener on Monday night as Cleveland welcomes Baltimore for a four-game series.	------	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

BOSTON -- — Teoscar Hernández belted a pair of three-run homers over the Green Monster — two of Toronto’s eight longballs — and Marcus Semien extended his road hitting streak to 26 games as the Blue Jays pounded the Boston Red Sox 18-4 on Sunday.	Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Bo Bichette, Lourdes Gurriel Jr., Cavan Biggio, Rowdy Tellez and Semien also went deep for the Blue Jays, a day after they belted five homers in a 7-2 victory. Guerrero’s was his major league-leading 21st.	Toronto's eight homers Sunday were the most allowed by Boston in franchise history.	“It’s unbelievable,” Hernández said. “I’m hoping it can be like that every day so we can have fun and laugh the whole game.”	Bichette had four of Toronto’s season-high 20 hits, and Guerrero, Hernández and Gurriel each had three. The Jays also reached a season high for runs.	“Honestly, I don’t know,” winning pitcher Robbie Ray said, when asked what he’d do if he was facing Toronto's lineup. “Maybe try to make them hit the ball right at somebody. The way that we were swinging it today was really impressive.”	Xander Bogaerts and Bobby Dalbec homered for Boston, which captured the series opener before Toronto’s power surge.	Semien’s club-record streak is the majors’ longest since Dexter Fowler hit safely in 27 straight road games for the Cubs from September 2015 to May 2016.	Toronto hit five homers in two straight games for the third time in team history, also in 2020 and 2017.	Ray (4-2) struck out 10 over six innings, giving up three runs, four hits and three walks.	The Blue Jays grabbed a 4-0 lead in the first against Martín Pérez on Hernández’s three-run homer and a solo shot from Gurriel.	Semien’s drive into the batters’ eye in center made it 5-0 in the second, prompting loud boos from the Fenway Park crowd. Those quickly turned to mock cheers when Red Sox manager Alex Cora came out to pull Pérez after the next batter, Bichette, singled.	“We need to do a better job, that’s the bottom line,” Cora said. “It’s been a horrible week for us pitching-wise.”	The Red Sox have given up 53 runs in their last six games.	Pérez (4-4) retired only four batters, getting tagged for five runs on six hits. In his last two starts, he’s allowed 11 runs in 3 1/3 innings, ballooning his ERA from 3.09 to 4.52.	“I’m not locating the ball where I want to,” he said. “The last two they have been hitting good against me, that’s part of the game.”	Toronto broke it open with four runs in the fourth and four more in the fifth, making it 13-1. Hernández hit his second three-run shot, a drive estimated at 440 feet that left Fenway in the fourth, after Guerrero’s RBI single.	In the fifth, Bichette’s three-run shot also left the park.	AIMING THERE	In the last two games, Toronto has hit nine homers over the fabled left-field wall.	“It’s really fun, when you hit a fly ball that’s a regular fly ball in other parks, here it (can be) a base hit, maybe a double,” Hernández said. “Some fly balls that don’t go for base hits in other parks are a single. I like to play here.”	EATING IT	RHP Ryan Weber, recalled from Triple-A Worcester before the game, went 5 2/3 innings, allowing 11 runs on 11 hits and striking out seven.	YOUR TURN	Boston utility player Marwin Gonzalez worked a perfect eighth, bringing cheers from the crowd with most of his pitches in the mid-40s mph range.	Second baseman Christian Arroyo pitched the ninth, giving up two unearned runs on Tellez’s homer.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Blue Jays: Placed Saturday’s winning pitcher, Steven Matz, on the COVID-19-related injured list. “He’s still going through additional testing,” manager Charlie Montoyo said. “The guys that were around him that are vaccinated came back negative, and that’s good news.”	Red Sox: Bogaerts was in the lineup after missing the last two games with a sore left knee. ... 3B Rafael Devers got the day off, with 1B Dalbec moving across the diamond.	UP NEXT	Toronto RHP Alek Manoah (1-0, 3.14 ERA) is scheduled to start the series finale Monday night against Boston righty Nathan Eovaldi (7-3, 4.11). Eovaldi is coming off his first loss since April 24.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MINNEAPOLIS -- — Michael Brantley had his second four-hit game of the series and drove in four runs, part of a 20-hit attack that helped the Houston Astros rout Minnesota 14-3 Sunday to take two of three from the Twins.	Minnesota’s Michael Pineda (3-4) left after four innings due to a reoccurrence of right forearm soreness that first bothered him June 1. In his second start since returning, he allowed three runs and six hits — raising his totals to 10 runs over 11 1/3 innings in his last three starts.	Kyle Tucker homered for the second straight game and had three hits for the Astros, who also swept the Twins in last year’s wild-card playoff round. Yordan Álvarez and Chas McCormick homered.	“This is a team that I feel like for a few years has been accustomed to winning, so I don’t think it’s a big surprise on any given day,” Álvarez said. “Every single guy on the team is capable of doing a lot of good things, and that’s what we were able to do today.”	Left-hander Framber Valdéz (3-0) won his third straight start, allowing two runs — one earned — and five hits in seven innings.	Houston went 7 for 21 with runners in scoring position and won its fourth straight series, completing a 6-3 trip that included games against Boston and Toronto.	“I’m happy,” Astros manager Dusty Baker said. “When you leave home on a 10-day road trip, you really don’t know what to expect. You hope that you do well and come home at least .500. We won every series, which was really big.”	Minnesota has lost four of its last six games. Ryan Jeffers and Nelson Cruz homered for the Twins.	“We have to play better,” Jeffers said. “We still have a lot of games remaining and we’re going to have to prove to everyone, including ourselves, that we’re capable of sustaining the good play that we show at times.”	Brantley had missed 12 games with right hamstring soreness and reached base in 15 of 23 plate appearances over five games since returning. He went 8 for 11 in the series with three doubles and two walks.	“He can hit and he works on it,” Baker said. “He knows he can hit. He’s tension-free. If you’re going to teach a kid how to hit, tell him to watch Michael Brantley.”	Alex Bregman’s first-inning sacrifice fly put Houston ahead to stay. Tucker homered for a 2-0 lead in the fourth, and Yuli Gurriel’s sacrifice fly and Carlos Correa’s RBI double made it 4-0 in the fifth.	PITCHING	Valdéz has allowed four earned runs in four starts since coming off the injured list. Valdéz missed the first 49 games of the season with a fractured left ring finger.	NOT AGAIN	Pineda could be headed to the injured list. Pineda has told manager Rocco Baldelli he can pitch with the soreness, but Baldelli believes rest is needed to recover.	“I think rest is something and the main thing that he needs right now,” Baldelli said. “How long that’s going to be, I’m not sure. This isn’t an injury, per se. This is muscle soreness that he’s having a tough time getting rid of. Something that rest is probably going to help.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Astros: C Jason Castro caught five innings on Friday during a rehab assignment with Triple-A Sugar Land, took Saturday off and played seven innings Sunday night, going 0 for 1 with a strikeout and two walks at the plate. … C Martín Maldonado was out of Sunday’s lineup in order to give him two days off. Baker said he’s dealing with tight hamstrings.	Twins: OF Max Kepler (left hamstring strain) started a rehab assignment with Triple-A St. Paul as the designated hitter on Sunday and was hitless in his first four at-bats. … OF Byron Buxton (right hip strain) and IF/OF Luis Arraez (right shoulder strain) didn’t play in rehab games on Sunday, instead taking a day to recover. Baldelli said the two will join the team on the trip to Seattle.	UP NEXT	Astros: RHP Lance McCullers Jr. (3-1, 2.96 ERA) will return from the injured list to start the series opener at home on Tuesday against Texas. McCullers has been out since May 22 with right shoulder soreness. Baker said that Jake Odorizzi will piggyback with McCullers, and the team will then move to a six-man rotation. RHP Kyle Gibson (4-0, 2.13) is scheduled to start for the Rangers.	Twins: RHP Kenta Maeda (2-2, 5.27) will make his return from the injured list on Monday for Minnesota as he starts at Seattle. Maeda had a right adductor strain and general right arm soreness and last pitched on May 22. The Mariners are scheduled to start LHP Marco Gonzales (1-4, 5.45).	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

MILWAUKEE -- — Avisaíl García hit a two-run homer, Christian Yelich added a pinch-hit sacrifice fly on his bobblehead day and the Milwaukee Brewers completed a three-game sweep of the Pittsburgh Pirates with a 5-2 win on Sunday.	Despite getting outhit 10-5, Milwaukee won for the 14th time in 16 games, including seven in a row at home.	“We had opportunities today and left people on base,” Pirates manager Derek Shelton said after his team left 10 on base and went 1 for 7 with runners in scoring position. “We left too many guys on base.”	The Pirates have lost seven straight. They were swept in back-to-back series after losing three at home against the Dodgers before heading to Milwaukee.	Brent Suter (8-3) picked up the win, getting the final out in the sixth. Brad Boxberger handled the seventh, Devin Williams the eighth and Josh Hader struck out the side in the ninth for his 17th save in as many chances.	Wil Crowe gave the Pirates beleaguered rotation a big lift with five impressive innings, but the bullpen couldn’t match his effort.	“We get to play a kid's game for a living,” Crowe said. “I got to use that as my mentality.”	Crowe allowed a leadoff single to Luis Urías and an RBI double by Daniel Vogelbach in the first, then retired the next 15 batters, striking out a career-high eight, before walking Tim Lopes to start the sixth.	“Crowe, he was sensational and gave them a great opportunity,” Brewers bench coach Pat Murphy said. “(He) stifled us for a while.”	Murphy filled in for manager Craig Counsell who was at his son's high school graduation	Pittsburgh turned to David Bednar (0-1) to protect the 2-1 led and Urías hit a run-scoring triple to tie it at 2. García then drove the first pitch just over the right-field wall for his 13th home run of the season.	Crowe was recalled Saturday from Triple-A Indianapolis when the Pirates placed Trevor Cahill (left calf strain) on the 10-day injured list.	“While their starter deserves a lot of credit, we put together some team offense when it counted,” Murphy said.	Jacob Stallings chased Milwaukee starter Adrian Houser with his fifth homer, a two-out shot that landed in the Brewers bullpen in left.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Pirates: Phillip Evans replaced 1B Colin Moran before the Brewers batted in the second. Moran has low back tightness and is day-to-day.	Brewers: Yelich almost had a scheduled game off. The Brewers remain cautious after his two stints on the 10-day injured list (lower back strain) already this season.	FRAZIER STAYS HOT	Adam Frazier came in batting .333 on the road trip and added two more base hits against the Brewers to improve to .385 (5 for 13). He's hit safely in eight of his last nine games at American Family Field and 25 of the last 27 games overall.	MURPHY SUBS FOR COUNSELL	“I think it’s a great gesture on his part to be with his family first,” Murphy said of Counsell's decision. “That’s what the organization stands for.”	UP NEXT	Pirates: RHP JT Brubaker (4-5, 3.90 ERA) faces LHP Jon Lester (0-2, 4.19 ERA) in the opener of a three-game road series against the Washington Nationals.	Brewers: LHP Eric Lauer (1-2, 4.82 ERA) squares off against RHP Vladimir Gutiérrez (2-1, 2.65 ERA) and the Cincinnati Reds in the first of three games.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- — Oakland's slugging Matts have a running joke how one is usually hot when the other's not.	Lately, both are driving the ball — and they combined for three home runs Sunday.	Matt Olson homered twice and Matt Chapman also connected, Chris Bassitt escaped a scary line drive to win his seventh straight decision, and the Oakland Athletics powered past the Kansas City Royals 6-3.	Olson hit solo shots in the third and fifth for his second two-homer game this season and 10th of his career. Chapman homered in the first to back Bassitt (7-2).	“We actually joke about it a pretty good bit that when one's hitting the other one never does,” Olson said. "It's nice to get a few games where we're both doing stuff. We honestly don't actually put weight into that but it seems like it sometimes. It’s definitely good to sync up a little bit."	Elvis Andrus added an RBI double in the second and Mark Canha hit a run-scoring single two batters later against Kris Bubic (1-2).	Bassitt had a scare in the second when Nicky Lopez's screaming liner glanced off his back side for an RBI single. The pitcher, clearly shaken, went face down in the grass with his arms spread for several moments as athletic trainer Nick Paparesta and manager Bob Melvin scurried to check on him, but Bassitt stayed in the game.	“It hit me in the perfect spot. That may sound weird,” Bassitt said. “It didn’t affect me at all.”	The hit by Lopez loaded the bases, but Bassitt regrouped and got Whit Merrifield on a called third strike to escape further damage.	Bassitt allowed two earned runs on five hits with five strikeouts, three walks — one intentional — and two hit batters over 5 2/3 innings. He is unbeaten since losing his initial two starts on April 1 and 6.	“I’m not here to win a Cy Young, I’m not here to be an All-Star, I’m here to win a World Series,” Bassitt said.	Just when the A's finally got a day devoid of wind during an especially blustery June stretch for the Bay Area, Chapman's home run ball left the bat at 103.1 mph and traveled 384 feet. Then Olson cleared the fences twice.	Bubic had five more strikeouts over 4 2/3 innings to give him has 27 in 30 innings as a starter.	Carlos Santana homered in the seventh for Kansas City, which still missed timely hits with runners on base.	“Just one of those that the big hit kind of alluded us,” manager Mike Matheny said. “We had a couple guys come up big but nobody on.”	Lou Trivino, Oakland's third reliever, finished for his 10th save and hasn't surrendered a run in June.	OLSON'S STROKE	After a four-hit performance Saturday, Olson added two more hits, took his team-leading home run total to 18 and wound up 7 for 15 in the four-game series.	The A's have won 13 of the last 18 meetings with Kansas City, which has an off day coming Thursday to end a stretch of 14 games in as many days.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Royals: Kansas City hopes to have SS Adalberto Mondesi back from the injured list for a strained left hamstring early in the week when the team returns home.	Athletics: CF Ramón Laureano, working back from a strained right hip that landed him on the IL, will hit Monday against live pitching in a simulated game against J.B. Wendelken — sidelined by a strained left oblique. Then Laureano is scheduled to run bases Tuesday. He may not need a rehab assignment in the minors if all goes well. “If we feel like we get enough at-bats for him off of J.B. and then he runs the bases well on Tuesday, it could be as easy as just activating him on Wednesday,” Melvin said. “A lot of it will revolve around how he feels when he gets his at-bats against J.B.” ... Leadoff man Canha returned to the lineup following a day off to rest.	UP NEXT	LHP Sean Manaea (5-2, 3.09 ERA) takes the ball for the A's in their series opener with the Angels on Monday having not allowed a run over his last two outings and 15 innings.	The Royals return to Kansas City to begin a six-game homestand with RHP Brad Keller (6-5, 5.75) making his team-high 14th start.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PHOENIX -- — Patrick Sandoval is turning into a pretty good pitcher for the Los Angeles Angels. He's also become a ringer at a fairly mundane task: Picking up the pregame lineup card, walking it to home plate and handing it to the umpires.	Max Stassi hit a two-run homer in the first, Sandoval delivered the winning lineup card for a sixth straight game and the Los Angeles Angels rolled to a 10-3 victory over the plunging Arizona Diamondbacks.	The left-handed Sandoval also delivered on the mound on Sunday, multi-tasking by pitching four-hit ball over six innings.	“It really comes down to the starting pitching,” Angels manager Joe Maddon said. “Sandy was really good.”	But Sandoval didn't let his pesky pitching responsibilities distract him from once again delivering the lucky lineup card. The 24-year-old said he was nervous when teammates told him to take the card out before Monday's game against the Royals.	“I dropped the card the first time, but I’m getting pretty good at it, I think," Sandoval said grinning.	The Angels moved above .500 for the first time since May 1 at 33-32. The Diamondbacks have lost 10 straight games and 33 of 38, falling to a big-league worst 20-46 this season. They're on pace for nearly 115 losses this season.	"It’s the hardest thing I’ve had to walk through in my managerial career,” Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said.	Stassi crushed his two-run shot on a full count, with the ball traveling 440 feet as it easily cleared the left-center field fence. The Angels added four runs in the second for a 6-0 lead, chasing Jon Duplantier (0-3).	“Stassi throwing the first punch,” Maddon said. “That was outstanding.”	Duplantier lasted just 1 1/3 innings and gave up six runs. His ERA jumped to 13.15 this season. Lovullo said it was “not a good day” for the 26-year-old right-hander.	Sandoval (1-2) gained his first win this year, easing through his first six innings without much trouble. He walked his first two batters and the Angels went to the bullpen.	His improvement has helped stabilize the Angels' rotation with five solid outings since moving into a starter's role.	Maddon said Sandoval was outstanding and looked like was getting comfortable in his role as a big leaguer. He's also got an eye on the pitcher's lineup card prowess: The manager said he would pay a bounty to the first player delivering 10 winning lineup cards in a row.	The left-handed Sandoval gave up two earned runs, struck out four and walked two. Angels leadoff hitter Justin Upton had three hits and scored two runs. Jared Walsh added a two-run homer — his 14th of the season — in the eighth.	Sandoval helped himself at the plate in the second inning, getting his first big league hit when he faked a bunt, pulled the bat back and then slapped a bouncing single over the a charging defense.	The 30-year-old Stassi continued his breakout season. This is the ninth straight year he's been in the big leagues, but he's only once had more than 100 at-bats in a season.	These days, he's a key contributor in the middle of the Angels' order, batting .339 with five homers. It's a big reason Los Angeles has been able to rise in the standings without star Mike Trout, who has missed multiple weeks with a strained right calf.	Arizona is on its second double-digit losing streak this season after a 13-game skid from May 17-29. Ketel Marte led the Diamondbacks with two hits and a walk.	SERPIENTES	The Diamondbacks might not be playing good baseball these days, but they did unveil some slick new jerseys on Sunday.	The sand-colored jerseys say “Serpientes” — which is the Spanish translation for snakes — with the capital “S” doubling as a snake that winds across the uniform. The Diamondbacks will debut the jerseys on Friday against the Dodgers.	The jerseys are part of the Nike MLB City Connect Series.	In recent years, the Diamondbacks have put a heavy emphasis on Arizona's Hispanic culture. According to the most recent U.S. Census, 42% of the state identifies as Hispanic.	"We are proud to be among the first teams to launch our City Connect uniforms that pay homage to so much of what makes life in Arizona unique,” said D-backs President Derrick Hall. “This concept is about bringing our community together, with respect for the past and an eye toward the future.”	UP NEXT	The Angels continue their trip on Monday at Oakland.

LOS ANGELES -- — Mookie Betts knows he's struggling. He still homered and scored three runs.	The Dodgers' bullpen let six straight Rangers reach base and allowed three runs in the ninth. Kenley Jansen still got three gritty outs with the bases loaded to end it.	Manager Dave Roberts was thoroughly unhappy with his team's performance. Los Angeles still moved within one game of the overall NL lead.	The standards are simply higher when you're the defending World Series champions, and the Dodgers are winning even when they aren't meeting their own expectations.	Walker Buehler pitched six scoreless innings of five-hit ball to remain unbeaten since 2019, and the Dodgers held off Texas 5-3 on Sunday when Jansen escaped a bases-loaded, nobody-out jam.	“Today, I don’t think we played a very good baseball game, and we came away with the win,” Roberts said.	Buehler (6-0) survived a rough first inning and made it through his second straight scoreless start, while his teammates cobbled together enough runs for a comfortable win. But the Dodgers’ bullpen struggled in the ninth until Jansen belatedly throttled the rally.	Jason Martin and Isiah Kiner-Falefa drove in runs in the ninth off reliever Phil Bickford. Jansen came on and gave up an RBI single to Willie Calhoun on his first pitch before Texas loaded the bases.	The veteran closer then got two popups before Nick Solak grounded out to end a nine-pitch at-bat and Jansen's 15th save. No wonder Roberts was frustrated, although he declined to give specifics.	“Throughout the game, there are some things we need to get better at,” Roberts said. “It’s just good that Kenley came in and shut the door.”	Zach McKinstry had a two-run double while going 3 for 3 with a walk, and Gavin Lux added his own RBI double in the fifth victory in six games. The Dodgers (39-26) moved right behind San Francisco (40-25) atop the division and secured the series win after these clubs traded 12-1 victories in the first two games.	One night after Texas ended its franchise-record-tying 16-game road losing streak, the Rangers fell to an MLB-worst 8-25 in interleague play over the past two seasons. They have lost 14 of 17 despite avoiding their eighth shutout loss of the season with that exciting ninth.	Buehler wasn't dominant by his own lofty standards, but he lasted at least six innings for the 13th time in his 13 starts this season — a feat he also accomplished in his final two playoff starts last season. He hasn't lost a decision since September 2019, going 10-0 in 28 appearances.	But after throwing seven scoreless innings at Pittsburgh last Tuesday, Buehler had to throw 33 pitches in the first against Texas. He walked the bases loaded, and the Rangers stole two bases before Buehler escaped without allowing a run.	“With Walker Buehler, we know this guy is good, and we had him on the ropes in the first inning,” Texas manager Chris Woodward said. “Getting a big hit there changes the entire game.”	The Dodgers took the lead two batters later when Betts walked and Lux drove him in with a double to the left-center gap off Dane Dunning (2-5).	Betts sliced his seventh homer into the short right field porch in the third, giving respite to the former AL MVP during a difficult stretch. Betts entered the game batting .225 in June.	“I don’t know exactly what I need to do, which is the frustrating part, but I just have to find a way,” Betts said.	McKinstry drove in two more runs with a two-out double later in the inning. The rookie also had two singles and a walk, ending his 2-for-23 slump since returning from his oblique muscle injury.	DUNNING DONE	Dunning yielded four runs on seven hits and two walks in four tough innings.	“I didn’t establish the zone at all,” Dunning said. “Wasn’t commanding the sinker. Even pitches that I threw well, that ended up doing good, was missed spots. Off the top of my head, I can only remember one good fastball I threw. That was it.”	BLUE KHRUSH	The Rangers placed veteran OF Khris Davis on unconditional release waivers, five days after designating him for assignment. The former Oakland slugger began the season on the injured list and then batted .157 in 61 plate appearances with his new team.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: C Jose Trevino didn't start for the second straight game. He has a sore hip, Woodward said.	Dodgers: OF Cody Bellinger missed his second straight game with left hamstring tightness.	UP NEXT	Rangers: After a day off, right-hander Kyle Gibson (4-0, 2.13 ERA) looks to continue his stellar season in a series opener Tuesday at Houston. Gibson is among the AL leaders in ERA, opponents' batting average (.196) and WHIP (1.00).	Dodgers: Tony Gonsolin (0-0, 5.40 ERA) hopes to rebound from a rough 2021 debut when LA opens a three-game series against Philadelphia at Dodger Stadium. Gonsolin got just five outs in Pittsburgh last week after missing the first two months with a shoulder injury.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

CHICAGO -- — Zach Davies tossed two-hit ball into the seventh inning to outduel Carlos Martinez, and the Chicago Cubs beat the St. Louis Cardinals 2-0 on Sunday night to complete a three-game sweep.	The Cubs have won five straight and 15 of 20 to remain in a tie with the Milwaukee Brewers atop the NL Central. Chicago kept up its success at Wrigley Field, where it has won six in a row and nine of 10.	“These guys are playing at a high level," manager David Ross said. "They're playing with a ton of confidence. I think the talent is showing up on a nightly basis. I think we find a way to win every single night. It's a good feeling to have a nice homestand and sweep a division opponent.”	The teams combined for only six hits, four by the Cubs. Anthony Rizzo went 1 for 4 and recorded the game's only RBI.	St. Louis has dropped three straight and 11 of 13 to fall one game below .500 for the first time since April 23 at 32-33.	Davies (4-3) struck out six and walked two in 6 2/3 innings to win his second straight start.	The right-hander retired the first 13 batters he faced before Tyler O'Neill singled off the glove of third baseman Patrick Wisdom. O'Neill tried for a double when the ball rolled into foul territory, but Wisdom recovered to throw him out.	The Cardinals' only threat against Davies came in the seventh. Dylan Carlson led off with a double, but Davies responded by getting sluggers Paul Goldschmidt and Nolan Arenado to ground out. Davies was pulled after walking O'Neill to put runners on first and second.	Ryan Tepera came on to get Yadier Molina to ground into a force play for the final out of the inning.	Tepera also worked a scoreless eighth and Craig Kimbrel struck out three in the ninth, working around a one-out walk, for his 18th save in 20 chances.	Martinez (3-7) allowed two unearned runs on four hits in seven innings to drop his third straight start. It was a dramatic turnaround from his previous two starts when the right-hander gave up a combined 15 runs in 4 2/3 innings, including 10 runs while getting just two outs on June 2 against the Los Angeles Dodgers.	“He was fantastic, he was tremendous,” St. Louis manager Mike Shildt said of Martinez. “Great passion, great pace. The slider was filthy, the 4-seamer was solid. He was in control of what he was doing the whole time.”	The Cubs scored twice in the third. Eric Sogard led off with a double, advanced to third on a groundout and scored when shortstop Paul DeJong misplayed a grounder by Joc Pederson for an error with two out. Two batters later, Pederson scored on a single by Rizzo.	GLOVE LOVE	Besides Martinez's rebound, the most positive aspect of the game for the Cardinals was two spectacular plays at third by Arenado.	In the second, he ranged to his right to snag a hot grounder seemingly headed down the line and threw an off-balanced strike to first base from foul territory to nab Willson Contreras. In the fourth, he made a similar play against Wisdom, this time bouncing a perfect throw on one hop for the out.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: LHP Kwang Hyun Kim (lower back tightness) threw a bullpen session before the game and gave a thumbs up to reporters as he exited the field. If there are no complications, Kim could start Tuesday night against Miami ... OF Justin Williams (neck stiffness) went 2 for 5 with an RBI and a run scored in two rehab appearances over the weekend for Triple-A Memphis. He is eligible to be activated from the 10-day injured list on Monday.	Cubs: SS Javier Báez was scratched from the original lineup because of a sore right thumb. He missed three games last week in San Diego because of the same thumb and seemed to aggravate it Saturday night after diving into the stands trying to catch a foul ball. He received treatment Sunday. “We don't want this to linger,” Ross said.	UP NEXT	Cardinals: RHP Adam Wainwright (4-5, 4.03 ERA) starts the opener of a three-game home series against Miami on Monday night. LHP Braxton Garrett (0-1, 6.43) goes for the Marlins.	Cubs: RHP Jake Arrieta (5-6, 4.97 ERA) pitches the opener of a four-game road series against the Mets. LHP David Peterson (1-5, 6.32) starts for New York.	—	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

NEW YORK -- — David Peterson pitched one-hit ball over six scoreless innings for his first win in two months, and the New York Mets beat the Chicago Cubs at home for the first time in exactly four years with a 5-2 victory Monday night.	Dominic Smith homered for the Mets, who stopped Chicago’s five-game winning streak in the opener of a four-game series between NL division leaders. New York scored all its runs with two outs and earned its first win at Citi Field against the Cubs since a 9-4 victory on June 14, 2017.	Chicago won the next seven meetings in Queens — a four-game sweep in 2018 and a three-game whitewash in 2019 — by a combined margin of 40-16. The teams didn’t play each other during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season.	Peterson (2-5) was 0-4 with a 6.32 ERA in his last nine starts, including 0-2 with a 9.88 ERA in his previous four appearances. But he allowed just a third-inning single to Eric Sogard — then picked him off second to end the inning — and a leadoff walk in the sixth to Sergio Alcantara.	“Being able to execute over and over again tonight felt really good,” Peterson said.	The second-year lefty, who was 6-2 with a 3.44 ERA in 10 games (nine starts) as a rookie, struck out three in a tidy 73-pitch performance.	“We believe in David and we know how good he is and how good he can be — and he showed it tonight and he’s showed it in the past,” Smith said. “That’s a No. 1 team in their division, so to go against a good club like that and compete and show that he wasn’t afraid … we’re just happy he was able to do it tonight.”	Smith, who was 2 for 3 with a walk, also ended a slump Monday. The left fielder, moved into the No. 3 spot in the lineup by manager Luis Rojas, walked in the first before breaking out of an 0-for-20 stretch in the fourth, when he singled for the Mets’ first hit off Jake Arrieta.	Smith advanced to second when Billy McKinney drew a two-out walk and scored on James McCann’s single. Kevin Pillar clipped McKinney, who was leading off third base, with a foul ball one pitch before hitting a two-run double to left-center.	Smith homered to center in the fifth to make it 4-0.	“I just felt good. I went through my routine today, I had a purpose for it,” said Smith, who said his legs felt stronger than they did over the weekend. “If I’m balanced, I’m going to be a dangerous player in that box. I just have to get consistent with that. When I do, that’s when I go on my little hot streaks.”	Pillar and Luis Guillorme drew back-to-back walks in the sixth before pinch-hitter Brandon Drury delivered an RBI single.	Anthony Rizzo and Patrick Wisdom hit back-to-back homers off reliever Trevor May in the seventh. The homer was Wisdom’s ninth in 20 games with the Cubs, the second-most by a Chicago player in his first 20 games behind Hank Sauer (10 homers in 20 games in 1954).	Aaron Loup retired all four batters he faced before Edwin Diaz earned his 13th save by striking out the side in a perfect ninth.	“I think we strung together good at-bats, we just came up a little bit short,” Wisdom said.	Arrieta (5-7) allowed four runs on four hits and four walks in five innings. He struck out three.	“Just didn’t do the job in the fourth inning,” Arrieta said. “At that point, the game wasn’t necessarily out of reach, but when you hand the ball to their bullpen with a three- or four-run lead, it’s not a good situation for us.”	TESTING, TESTING	The first pitch was delayed three minutes so the Cubs could confirm their replay system was working. After Peterson’s final warmup toss, a pair of umpires jogged over to the area near Chicago’s dugout and donned the headsets to test the system.	BULLPEN SHUFFLE	The Mets recalled right-hander Sean Reid-Foley from Triple-A Syracuse and designated right-hander Jacob Barnes for assignment. Barnes gave up a tiebreaking grand slam Sunday to Fernando Tatis Jr. followed by a home run by Manny Machado in the Mets’ 7-3 loss to San Diego.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Cubs: SS Javier Baez (right thumb) didn’t start for a second straight game but hit in the cage Monday afternoon and grounded out as a pinch-hitter in the eighth. ... INF Matt Duffy (lower back strain) is on pace to begin a rehab assignment shortly. ... RHP Trevor Williams (appendicitis) has been throwing every day and could ramp up his recovery once he visits a doctor later this week.	Mets: McKinney (right knee) returned to the starting lineup after missing two games. ... RF Michael Conforto (right hamstring) ran the bases and CF Brandon Nimmo (left index finger) participated in batting practice. Both players could soon begin rehab assignments. ... OF Albert Almora Jr. (left shoulder), who has played in five rehab games for Triple-A Syracuse, is on track to return this weekend.	UP NEXT	Cubs: RHP Alex Mills (2-0, 6.08 ERA) is scheduled to make his first start since April 13 and second appearance since coming off the injured list June 8.	Mets: RHP Taijuan Walker (5-2, 2.07 ERA) struck out nine last Wednesday against Baltimore, his most whiffs since he fanned 10 for the Arizona Diamondbacks against Colorado on Sept 1, 2017.	------	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

WASHINGTON -- — Kyle Schwarber homered again to snap a seventh-inning tie and drove in two runs for the Washington Nationals in their 3-2 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Monday night.	Jon Lester pitched 5 1/3 solid innings to help the Nationals win for the third time in four games.	Schwarber’s homer was his fourth in three days. The Nationals moved him to the leadoff spot Saturday in the opener of a day-night doubleheader. He led off that game with a home run, hit two more on Sunday and launched the go-ahead shot this time against reliever Clay Holmes (2-2).	“When he’s swinging at balls in the zone, he’s going to hit it hard somewhere,” Nationals manager Dave Martinez said.	Schwarber also had an RBI single in the third and walked. His lone out was a line drive caught by leaping second baseman Adam Frazier in the first inning.	Lester made it into the sixth for just the fourth time in nine starts this season. He allowed a leadoff double, then got a line-drive out before being removed. The 37-year-old left-hander is averaging 4 2/3 innings per start this year. He does not have a win yet.	“At the end of the day, we’ve got to win ballgames,” Lester said. “I don’t care how we do it.”	Wander Suero replaced him and allowed a soft single and Erik Gonzalez's sacrifice fly that tied it at 2.	Kyle Finnegan (3-2) struck out two in a hitless inning for the win. Brad Hand pitched a scoreless ninth for his 12th save in 14 tries.	Schwarber pushed Victor Robles home with his single in the third. Juan Soto’s single drove in Trea Turner to give the Nationals a 2-1 lead later in the inning.	“When our offense starts clicking, and we start scoring runs, we’ll start consistently winning games,” Martinez said.	Kevin Newman opened the scoring with his second homer of the season to give the Pirates a 1-0 lead in the second.	Pittsburgh starter JT Brubaker allowed two runs and four hits in five innings.	SCHERZER ON THE STICKY STUFF	Washington ace Max Scherzer is one of eight players on the MLBPA executive committee and one of just two association player representatives. So, when he speaks on a broad topic, his words carry weight beyond his Hall of Fame pitching résumé.	He was asked Monday about Major League Baseball’s expected crackdown on pitchers using the “sticky stuff” to improve their grip, and, at times, spin rates, when throwing the baseball.	“There’s solutions to all of us and how we go forward with this and what should be the rules of what the practice should be,” Scherzer said. “And specifically, what hitters want. I think that’s the biggest question: What do hitters want? We’ve heard from a lot of hitters. All the hitters that talk publicly, they want the pitchers to have a tack over the baseball, a grip over the baseball. So what that looks like, that’s a conversation we’ll have.”	Scherzer also mentioned he knew as much about baseball's prospective enforcement as reporters did, meaning MLB is not communicating with the union about it.	“Whatever’s been written is what we know,” Scherzer said. “There hasn’t been additional information other than that.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Pirates: RHP Trevor Cahill was placed on the 10-day injured list Saturday because of a left calf injury, two days after being reinstated from the IL. He threw only 1 1/3 innings in his start Thursday. Pittsburgh manager Derek Shelton said the Pirates will take their time bringing the veteran pitcher back next time. “I think we’ll look at different ways to treat it, whether it’s different modalities or lengths of time, and just continue to go on that path and see how we can get him back healthy,” Shelton said.	Nationals: Scherzer threw a bullpen but it did not go as well as he hoped. He threw 10 pitches and his groin would not loosen up, so he will not make his scheduled start Wednesday. The three-time Cy Young Award winner said it's up to Martinez whether he goes on the injured list or simply has his turn pushed back a few days. Scherzer tweaked his groin Friday and got only one out. He said Sunday he would not be able to make his next scheduled start if he could not get through a bullpen.	UP NEXT	Pittsburgh sends LHP Tyler Anderson (3-6, 4.52 ERA) to the mound in the middle game of the series. Struggling LHP Patrick Corbin (3-5, 6.21) goes for the Nationals.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

CLEVELAND -- — The Indians didn't let a rough day get any worse by losing to the woeful Orioles.	José Ramírez picked up a pair of RBI — made possible by Baltimore blunders in the field — and Cleveland shook off losing ace Shane Bieber for at least a few weeks by extending the Orioles' road losing streak to 16 straight games with a 4-3 win Monday night.	The Indians' victory was tempered by the Bieber going on the injured list for an unknown period due to a shoulder strain. The reigning AL Cy Young winner won't be allowed to pick up a baseball for two weeks.	“It’s kind of a kick in the stomach when you hear that about Bieber,” Indians manager Terry Francona said. "And we’re asking a lot of young guys to do things that maybe they haven’t done before: pitching on short rest, starting a game but not being terribly stretched out.	“But at least if we pull in the right direction all together, I always feel like we’ll figure it out.”	Ramírez drove in a run off Dean Kremer (0-6) in the first inning when Baltimore left fielder DJ Stewart slipped in the wet grass going after a routine fly. Ramirez added an RBI double in the sixth when Orioles second baseman Stevie Wilkerson dropped his foul pop, giving him another try.	Baltimore made two errors in the sixth.	“The bottom line is we just didn't play defense tonight,” said Orioles manager Brandon Hyde, who was ejected in the first inning. “You got to have to play defense in the big leagues to win and we made numerous plays that hurt us.”	Indians rookie reliever Nick Sandlin (1-0) picked up his first career win by striking out three of the five batters he faced.	James Karinchak worked out of a jam in the seventh and followed a leadoff walk by striking out the side in the eighth. Emmanuel Clase worked a 1-2-3 ninth for his 10th save.	Bieber's absence will force Francona to be creative with his pitching staff, especially his solid bullpen.	“We’re going to have to play it by ear every night,” he said. “If a guy’s rolling and we stay with him, that’s OK, too. We’ll have to know that he’s not going to be available for a while. It’s going to be a lot of communication. We’re going to need a lot of honesty from them and see if we can make it work.”	The start was pushed back one hour by rain, but the Orioles couldn't delay extending their team record road losing slide. Baltimore hasn't won away from home since John Means pitched a no-hitter at Seattle on May 5.	As bad as it is, Baltimore's streak isn't even the longest in the majors this season. Texas also lost 16 in a row from May 10 to June 11, and Arizona has currently lost 20 straight on the road.	The 1963 New York Mets hold the record with 22 straight road losses.	Hyde made it through the rain delay, but not the first inning as he got ejected for arguing.	The Indians caught a break while scoring three runs in the first inning, which included Hyde getting tossed for protesting an overturned call.	With a runner on first, Francona won a video review challenge when Amed Rosario was awarded first after being hit by a pitch. Hyde charged from the dugout and was immediately thrown out by first base umpire Nestor Ceja.	Cleveland's first run scored when Ramírez lofted a fly and Stewart lost his footing and fell. Eddie Rosario followed with a sacrifice fly and Bobby Bradley hit an RBI single.	The Orioles cut it to 3-2 in the fourth on RBI groundouts by Stewart and Freddy Galvis.	Ramírez capped a nine-pitch at-bat with his double in the sixth, the hit coming after failed to squeeze his deep foul ball way down the first-base line.	“You give Ramirez a second chance and he's going to end up hurting you,” Hyde said.	ACE DOWN	Bieber hasn’t pitched up to his lofty standards lately, and the right-hander could be feeling the effects of averaging an MLB-leading 105 pitches per start. He threw 107 in only five innings in a loss to Seattle on Sunday and underwent an MRI that revealed swelling.	“So we need to slow him down, let this thing calm down,” Francona said.	SOFT SCHEDULE	The Indians will only play two teams currently with winning records the rest of June. After four games with the Orioles, who came in with the AL's worst record, they'll face Pittsburgh, the Cubs, Minnesota and Detroit.	The easy schedule doesn't necessarily help. Cleveland entered the series 16-17 against clubs under .500 and 18-11 against winning teams.	UP NEXT	Indians RHP Cal Quantrill (0-2) makes his third start and faces Orioles RHP Matt Harvey (3-7), who has lost seven of his past eight starts.	------	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

BOSTON -- — The Toronto Blue Jays hit 15 homers in a four-game series at Fenway Park, with 11 of them sailing over the Green Monster.	The Boston Red Sox only needed to bang two off it to earn a split.	Rafael Devers hit a line drive off the left-field wall in the bottom of the ninth inning on Monday night after Vladimir Guerrero Jr. cleared it for a tying drive in the top half, and the Red Sox bounced back from their worst loss of the season to beat Toronto 2-1.	It was Boston’s second walkoff win of the series, with Alex Verdugo delivering a game-winning single in a similar spot on Friday night. In between, the Blue Jays won 7-2 and 18-4, hitting 13 homers in the two wins — a record eight on Sunday alone.	“Yesterday was just a game,” Red Sox manager Alex Cora said. “Like I said: 18-4, 1-0, 2-1, if you lose you lose, if you win it, you win it. We just earned a split against them. They didn’t gain ground on us. We didn’t lose ground on them. And now we go to Atlanta.”	Matt Barnes was two strikes away from finishing off a combined three-hit shutout when Guerrero homered 451 feet onto Lansdowne Street to tie the game 1-all. It was his major league-leading 22nd home run of the season, and his fourth in as many games.	But Verdugo, who also drove in Boston’s first run, and J.D. Martinez singled off Rafael Dolis (1-3) to lead off the bottom of the ninth. One out later, Devers banged one off the wall in left-center; he stopped before reaching second to receive the congratulations of his teammates pouring out of the dugout, and was credited with a single.	One day after Toronto's eight home runs set a record for a visiting team at 109-year-old Fenway Park, Nathan Eovaldi took a one-hitter into the seventh. He held them to three hits and a walk in all, while striking out four in 6 2/3 innings.	“As bad as the last two games have been, to split this series 2-2 is big for us,” Eovaldi said, adding that he was eager to end to a string of bad starts from the Red Sox rotation. “Whenever we get on a good streak, it starts with pitching. It takes one starter to go out there and do a good job, and it resets everybody.”	Josh Taylor retired four straight batters, striking out three of them, and Barnes (3-1) got two quick outs before Guerrero tied it.	“Vladdy’s nasty right now,” Devers said.	Verdugo, Devers and Marwin Gonzalez each had two of Boston’s seven hits.	Gonzalez singled to lead off the third inning, Kiké Hernández replaced him on a fielder’s choice and then scored when Verdugo’s double hit the top of the Green Monster scoreboard, buying just enough time for him to race around from first.	Toronto rookie Alek Manoah went six innings, allowing one run on four hits and a walk, striking out five.	Guerrero and Teoscar Hernandez singled to lead off the seventh, but Randal Grichuk grounded into a 5-4-3 double play, and then Taylor came on to strike out Rowdy Tellez to strand the runner at third.	The Red Sox had lost four of the previous six games, with their starters allowing 31 runs in 25 innings. In Sunday’s loss to Toronto, Boston allowed season highs of 18 runs, 20 hits and 11 extra-base hits.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Blue Jays: Manager Charlie Montoyo said OF George Springer will begin a rehab assignment in Triple-A on Tuesday night. He is expected to play five innings in the field for the Buffalo Bisons in Rochester. The 2017 World Series MVP with Houston, Springer started the season on the injured list with a strained right quadriceps muscle and lasted just four games when he returned in April before going back on the IL.	Red Sox: Acquired pitcher Yacksel Rios from the Mariners for cash. Designated RHP Ryan Weber for assignment to make room on the 40-man roster. Called up INF Michael Chavis from Triple-Worcester for Monday’s game.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays: LHP Hyun Jin Ryu (5-4) opens a three-game series against the Yankees, who will send LHP Jordan Montgomery (3-1) to the mound.	Red Sox: LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (5-4) pitches the opener of a two-game series in Atlanta against LHP Tucker Davidson (0-0).	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MILWAUKEE -- — At a time when the Milwaukee Brewers are playing as well as just about any team in the majors, Cincinnati Reds rookie Vladimir Gutiérrez is the one guy who has their number.	Gutiérrez and three relievers combined on a four-hitter with 12 strikeouts to help the Reds trounce the Brewers 10-2 on Monday night for their fourth straight victory.	It marked the second time in less than a week that the 25-year-old right-hander beat Milwaukee. The Brewers are 0-2 against Gutiérrez and 9-0 against everyone else over their last 11 games.	“He’s still a young pitcher, but man, to step in and handle situations like he is, is the most impressive thing,” Reds manager David Bell said. “The entire organization has thought very highly of him for a long time and you try to find the right time in his development to put him in this situation. I think it’s safe to say this was the right time.”	Gutiérrez allowed two runs over seven innings Wednesday in a 7-3 victory over the Brewers. This time, he gave up two runs and struck out six in six innings.	“Whatever I worked on last time against the Brewers, I wanted to match that up,” Gutiérrez said through a translator. “Obviously I went seven innings last time, but I had that same mentality going into this start as well.”	Joey Votto and Aristides Aquino each hit a two-run homer for the Reds. Votto went 2 for 4, scored twice and drove in three runs.	Gutiérrez (3-1) won his third straight start in his fourth career appearance. Heath Hembree, Amir Garrett and Art Warren teamed up for three innings of perfect relief.	The Brewers had one baserunner and no hits after the second inning.	“You have to give credit where credit is due,” said Daniel Vogelbach, who homered off Gutiérrez in the first inning. “That’s two games in a row that he’s made it real tough on us. He has a really good fastball and he throws a curveball for a strike when he wants to. He’s just a guy in a groove right now who’s doing what he wants on the mound.”	Milwaukee had its four-game winning streak snapped but remained tied for first place in the NL Central with the Chicago Cubs, who lost 5-2 to the New York Mets.	Jonathan India went 3 for 4 with a run and an RBI for the Reds.	Brewers starter Eric Lauer (1-3) allowed four runs and five hits in five innings. He struck out three, walked four and drove in a run with a sacrifice fly.	Lauer labored through a first inning in which he gave up a hit and two walks but only one run. India hit a leadoff single and scored when Votto grounded to first with the bases loaded.	After Vogelbach’s homer tied the game in the bottom half, the Reds pulled ahead for good with three runs in a second inning that featured an RBI double from India and a run-scoring single from Jesse Winker.	“He just didn’t have a great feel for where the ball was going in the first two innings, really,” Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. “The first inning, he got out of it, but it was 30-some pitches. Then the second inning, he left some balls in the middle of the strike zone, really, that they hit hard.”	Votto homered  off reliever Eric Yardley in the seventh. Eugenio Suárez hit a two-run single and Aquino delivered his two-run shot off Hoby Milner in the ninth.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Reds: Bell said INF Mike Moustakas is scheduled to play for Triple-A Louisville on Tuesday and Wednesday at Omaha in hopes of returning for Cincinnati’s weekend series at San Diego. Moustakas hasn’t played since May 18 due to a right heel bruise.	Brewers: 2B Kolten Wong took batting practice on the field as he works his way back from a left oblique strain that landed him on the injured list June 4.	STRICKLAND ACTIVATED	Hunter Strickland made his Brewers debut and pitched a scoreless eighth inning. The Brewers activated Strickland earlier in the day and optioned reliever Patrick Weigel to Triple-A Nashville.	Milwaukee acquired Strickland on Saturday from the Los Angeles Angels, who had designated him for assignment.	UP NEXT	RHP Luis Castillo (2-9, 6.47 ERA) starts for the Reds against LHP Brett Anderson (2-4, 4.99) when the teams continue their three-game series Tuesday.	------	Follow Steve Megargee at https://twitter.com/stevemegargee	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

Willi Castro, Robbie Grossman and Niko Goodrum homered for Detroit. Miguel Cabrera got three hits and drove in two runs, with his RBI single keying a four-run first inning.	The Royals, who have not led since finishing off Thursday’s 6-1 victory in Oakland, lost their fourth in a row. They are a season-worst five games below .500.	Boyd departed in the third because of discomfort in his left arm. Lange left after recording just one out in the fifth with shoulder trouble.	“(Boyd) came into that inning and was throwing well,” Detroit manager A.J. Hinch said. “After a few pitches he called us out. He said he felt a little something in his tricep."	Boyd told the team trainer that his arm had felt odd the whole inning.	“We immediately removed him from the game. We’re going to send him for some tests. It’s very disappointing on the night because he was throwing the ball well with probably the best fastball he’s had in the last month," Hinch said.	Hinch said he didn't know if Boyd would miss any time.	“I think Lange is going to end up on the injured list from the initial diagnosis,” Hinch said. “He’s had some shoulder issues. I didn’t even get out to the mound. By the time I got to the (foul) line, they were already walking off.”	Royals starter Brad Keller (6-6) struggled throughout, allowing six earned runs and eight hits in five innings.	“I think he’s trying to overdo it a little bit,” Royals manager Mike Matheny said. “He feels good. Sometimes when he tries to hump up his fastball he gets too much movement.”	Keller has struggled in the first inning all season. Following three earned runs in the first on Monday, his ERA in the first inning is now 9.64. Keller didn’t record an out until his 22nd pitch when he struck out Eric Haase.	Keller hit Grossman with his first pitch of the game, Harold Castro singled and Jonathan Schoop reached on an error that rolled through the legs of third baseman Kelvin Gutierrez, allowing a run to score. Cabrera added an RBI single and Goodrum hit a two-run single.	After giving up back-to-back, one-out singles in the third by Whit Merrifield and Carlos Santana, Boyd was pulled from the game. He was relieved by Joe Jimenez (2-0), who struck out Salvador Perez and got Jorge Soler to pop out.	Castro hit a two-run homer in the fourth. Goodrum connected in the eighth and Grossman homered in the ninth.	The Royals scored a run in the fourth on a two-out double by Hanser Alberto that drove in Edward Olivares, who was called up to replace the injured Andrew Benintendi.	The Royals got runs in the fifth and sixth innings, but left the bases loaded in both.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Tigers: C Grayson Greiner began an injury rehab assignment with Triple-A Toledo on Sunday. He went 1 for 3 with a walk and scored a run. He has been out since May 12 with a strained left hamstring.	Royals: SS Adalberto Mondesi was eligible to come off the 10-day injured list Monday, but he was not ready, according to Matheny. Mondesi came out of the game May 31 with a left hamstring strain.	ROSTER NEWS	Tigers: RHP Michael Fulmer was reinstated from the IL. He is 4-3 with a 3.34 ERA in 20 appearances (four starts). Since being moved to the closer’s role, he’s converted four out of five save opportunities.	Royals: Benintendi was placed on the IL with a right rib fracture. Matheny said Benintendi was injured making a throw from the warning track Sunday in Oakland. OF Edward Olivares was recalled.	UP NEXT	Tigers: RHP Casey Mize (3-4, 3.44 ERA) will look to continue a streak of seven quality starts in his last eight. The only game he didn’t get a quality start was a five-inning outing when allowed just one run against the New York Yankees on May 28.	Royals: LHP Mike Minor (5-3, 4.50 ERA) will try to build on his last outing, when he allowed only a solo home run in seven innings against Oakland. He gave up three hits, struck out eight and walked one.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

CHICAGO -- — Austin Meadows, Brandon Lowe and Randy Arozarena homered, and the Tampa Bay Rays beat the Chicago White Sox 5-2 on Monday night for their fourth straight win.	Tampa Bay improved to 43-24, 1 1/2 games ahead of the White Sox for the best record in the majors. The Rays have won seven of eight.	“The two top teams going at it, we know it was going to be a game where one big hit or home runs will do the job,” Meadows said. “To be fortunate enough to get three long balls tonight, you're going to have those nights when you score off the home runs.”	Tampa Bay starter Tyler Glasnow left after four innings with right elbow inflammation. The 6-foot-8 right-hander allowed two runs on three hits, walked one and struck out six, throwing 40 of 53 pitches for strikes.	Glasnow sensed something wasn't right, but not terribly painful, in the elbow as he tossed his final pitches in the fourth. He told the coaching staff and was replaced by Ryan Thompson.	“The last couple of pitches I felt just a little tug,” Glasnow said. “I didn't want to go out and chance it. The velo was still there, it just felt not right.”	Glasnow said he planned to get an MRI on Tuesday.	Tim Anderson had two hits and Brian Goodwin added an RBI single for the White Sox, whose four-game winning streak ended.	Four Tampa Bay relievers — Thompson, J.P. Feyereisen (3-2), Diego Castillo and Pete Fairbanks — followed with five scoreless innings of two-hit ball. Fairbanks pitched a perfect ninth for his third save.	The Rays' bullpen, which tossed seven no-hit innings in a win over Baltimore on Sunday, entered with an AL-best 3.05 ERA.	“The bullpen has been just has hot as any bullpen in baseball,” manager Kevin Cash said. “Other than Glasnow, that's the story of the game.”	Lance Lynn (7-2) allowed three runs on six hits in six innings as he lost for the first time since April 15.	Lynn allowed as many as three runs for only the second time in 12 starts. The big right-hander entered having won six straight decisions and with a 1.23 ERA that was second to the Mets' Jacob deGrom among major league starters.	“Tonight they did some timely hitting,” Lynn said. “You look at a mid-June challenge, which is fun, but we're in a good spot and we've just got to keep going.”	Meadows and Lowe both went deep on 1-0 pitches against Lynn.	“He's been pitching as good as anyone in the game,” Cash said. “He's not a guy you can wait around on. He's going to throw the ball in the zone. If you like it, hit it.”	Meadows, who entered in a 1-for-17 slump, lofted Lynn’s sinker deep to right in the first inning for his team-leading 15th homer.	Lowe turned on a cutter in the third, driving the ball just inside the right-field foul pole for his 12th homer and a 3-0 lead.	The White Sox cut it to 3-2 in the bottom half. Leury Garcia scored from third on a wild pitch. Anderson, who had doubled, came home on Goodwin’s single.	Arozarena made it 4-2 in the eighth off Garrett Crochet with his second homer in two games. Brett Phillips drove in a run with an infield single in the ninth.	GLOVE SAVE	While diving forward on his stomach in center field, Goodwin reached out and snagged Arozarena’s sinking liner for the second out in the fifth.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Rays: Reinstated 1B Ji-Man Choi (left groin strain) from the 10-day injured and optioned INF Mike Brosseau to Triple-A Durham. Choi started on Monday after missing nine games in his second stint on the IL this season.	White Sox: 3B Yoán Moncada sat out with what manager Tony La Russa called a “cold with a lot of congestion.” Garcia started at third. ... LF Eloy Jiménez, out since suffering a ruptured pectoral tendon in spring training, has been medically cleared to resume baseball activities at the team’s facility in Glendale, Arizona. The White Sox expect this phase of Jiménez’s rehab to take at least four weeks. There’s no timetable for his return to Chicago.	UP NEXT	Tampa Bay rookie LHP Shane McClanahan (2-1, 4.54 ERA) faces Chicago LHP Dallas Keuchel (5-1, 4.14) on Tuesday night.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

ST. LOUIS -- — Tyler O’Neill doubled home the tiebreaking run in the eighth inning and the slumping St. Louis Cardinals beat the Miami Marlins 4-2 on Monday night to halt a three-game slide.	Adam Wainwright tossed six effective innings and Paul Goldschmidt had two hits and an RBI as the Cardinals won for only the third time in 14 games.	Dylan Floro (2-4), the fifth Miami pitcher, began the eighth with a walk to Dylan Carlson before Goldschmidt singled. With one out, O’Neill hit his second double of the game to score Carlson, who had two singles.	“I've had a couple of chances like that this year and came up a little short,” said O'Neill, who hiked his batting average to .291. “I really wanted to put the ball in play there somewhere hard and give Dylan a good chance to score. That was a good one to get. We've been scuffling a little bit and no one hates losing more than we do. We've got to keep scrapping out there.”	Paul DeJong drove in Goldschmidt with a groundout to make it 4-2.	Giovanny Gallegos (4-1) pitched a hitless inning and Alex Reyes retired the side in the ninth for his 17th save.	Miami had won four of five.	The Cardinals tied it 2-all on an RBI single by Goldschmidt in the fifth when St. Louis knocked out 23-year-old rookie starter Braxton Garrett, who went 4 1/3 innings.	“I felt like I had a great start," Garrett said. “I'd like to have kept going. I'm sure that will come with experience. I'd like to go deeper. I'd like to get to seven. I need to be more efficient and get quicker outs.”	Jazz Chisholm Jr. singled with two outs in the third, scoring Jon Berti and Starling Marte, to give Miami a 2-1 lead. Wainwright loaded the bases on a single and two walks after retiring the first two batters.	Chisholm has reached base in 20 of the 22 games he’s played since returning from the injured list May 16.	“We had a few innings after that to try and build on the score and we didn't,” Miami manager Don Mattingly said.	St. Louis scored its first run in the second on a single by Edmundo Sosa.	“I’m happy to contribute in any way to the team,” Sosa said through a translator.	The 39-year-old Wainwright faced an opposing pitcher with fewer then 10 career appearances for the fourth straight start. He allowed two runs and four hits with six strikeouts, fanning Jorge Alfaro in the fourth for his 1,900th career punchout.	“We have not been playing great ball but I've got a sneaky suspicion that things are going to turn around for us,” Wainwright said. “What we just went through I think will help us in the long run. We'll see what we're made of. I know the guys in the clubhouse aren't folding up. I like our chances to come back strong.”	DON’T FORGET TO TOUCH HOME	Sosa made his first start at second base and the move paid off in the second inning. Magneuris Sierra doubled to center and the ball scooted past Carlson. Tommy Edman fielded it and threw to Sosa, who wheeled and fired home. Adam Duvall, who had singled, slid past the plate and catcher Yadier Molina dropped the ball. Duvall tried to touch the plate, but Molina tagged him. After a review, the out call was upheld. ... In the third inning with two outs, O’Neill doubled to left-center. Marte threw to Chisholm and he fired to Alfaro just off the plate. However, Carlson, who led off with a single, missed home plate and Alfaro tagged him out. After a review, the call stood.	“I've never seen two plays like that in the same game,” Wainwright said. “That was crazy.”	MOLINA'S PICKOFF PLAY	In the seventh, Molina ended the inning when pinch-hitter John Curtiss struck out trying to bunt and Molina fired a bullet to first, where Sosa snuck in behind Isan Diaz and tagged him out.	“We had a second baseman make a very smart play with Yadi,” Cardinals manager Mike Shildt said. “What a heads-up play by Yadi and a great job by Sosa. Guy bunts through it and it's a good time for a back pick. Sosa saw it and Yadi does what he does.”	PLAYER OF THE WEEK	Marte was selected National League player of the week for the first time in his career Monday. He is the first winner for the Marlins since Giancarlo Stanton and Marcell Ozuna were named co-players of the week on Sept. 25, 2017.	ROSTER MOVE	RHP Luis Madero’s contract was selected from Triple-A Jacksonville to join the Marlins. Madero, 24, made two relief appearances for Miami in May and went to Jacksonville after he was unclaimed on waivers. The rookie had been designated for assignment May 15.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Marlins: INF Jose Devers (right shoulder impingement) was placed on 10-day injured list. Devers exited Sunday’s game after irritating his right shoulder. ... INF Brian Anderson (left shoulder subluxation), sidelined since May 25, has been transferred to the 60-day IL.	Cardinals: RHP Kodi Whitley (mid-back spasms) is playing catch and Shildt said Whitley is around four to six days from getting back on a mound.	UP NEXT	Marlins: LHP Trevor Rogers (7-3, 2.02 ERA) makes his second career start against the Cardinals on Tuesday night. He lost to St. Louis on April 5.	Cardinals: LHP Kwang Hyun Kim (1-4, 4.05) returns from his second stint on the injured list for his first outing since sustaining a back injury on June 4. He was removed after just three innings because of lower back stiffness and took his fourth straight defeat as Cincinnati connected off him for a pair of homers. Kim missed just one start.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DENVER -- — Austin Gomber continued his dominance at hitter-friendly Coors Field with eight shutout innings, and the Colorado Rockies held on to beat the scuffling San Diego Padres 3-2 on Monday night.	Gomber (6-5) improved to 3-1 at home, where he hasn’t allowed an earned run in 23 1/3 innings and has a 0.95 ERA in five starts in 2021.	“I like pitching here. I don’t have an issue,” Gomber said. “I feel pretty comfortable.”	Gomber held the Padres to three hits and didn’t walk a batter. He has walked just four in his last nine starts and has won three straight starts. Gomber also added a single at the plate.	“Early on, once he got settled into spring training and once we started the regular season he tried too hard,” Colorado manager Bud Black said. “Now I think he’s got it together with a calmness and poise on the mental side, which is awesome.”	San Diego has lost 10 of its last 14 and has scored just nine runs in its last seven losses.	“We’re definitely a frustrated group but we’re going to go back at it tomorrow,” manager Jayce Tingler said. “We’ve got (Yu) Darvish going tomorrow and we’re going to come out, swing the bats and be aggressive and see if we can get something going offensively.”	Trent Grisham hit a two-run homer in the Padres ninth off Daniel Bard. He then retired Manny Machado and Fernando Tatis Jr. to earn his ninth save.	Gomber set down the first nine batters he faced before Tommy Pham led off the fourth with an infield single, but he was erased on a double play.	The lefty said he changed his approach after a start in St. Louis on May 7 when he allowed five runs in five innings.	“I had really good stuff in St. Louis and I should have pitched better than I did. I felt like a lot of it was the way I was attacking,” Gomber said. “It wasn’t to my strength, I felt like I was pitching more to a scouting report than my strengths.”	C.J. Cron hit a solo homer in the seventh for a 2-0 lead.	The Rockies got their first run in the third off Dinelson Lamet (1-2) on Trevor Story’s two-out single. They added another run on an RBI double by Ryan McMahon in the eighth.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Padres: Tingler said LHP Drew Pomeranz (left shoulder impingement) and C Austin Nola (left knee sprain) are still a few weeks away from rehab assignments. Tingler said Nola has been doing some activity working toward a rehab assignment.	Rockies: INF Chris Owings (thumb) was sent on a rehab assignment to Triple-A Albuquerque and was scheduled to play “five or six innings and hopefully three at-bats” of the Isotopes game on Monday night, Black said. Owings will play multiple games at different positions.	I GOT IT?	The sun was tough on the first basemen in the early innings and twilight played tricks on Wil Myers in the seventh. When Cron’s high drive to right was in the air Myers was looking up but couldn’t locate the ball. He was still searching for it when it landed in the seats behind him.	“There’s about a 10-to-15 minute window every single game where the sun kind of goes down,” Myers said. “When the ball gets above the lights you can’t find it; it’s just a shadow up there somewhere. Pretty helpless feeling not seeing the ball.”	STREAKING ROCKIES	Charlie Blackmon and Raimel Tapia each singled for Colorado to extend their hitting streaks. Blackmon has hit safely in 13 straight, the longest current streak in the majors, and Tapia has a hit in 11 straight games.	GRAY SKIES GONNA CLEAR UP	Black said righty Jon Gray (right flexor tendon) threw a bullpen session Monday and said he thinks Gray’s stay on the injured list won’t be long.	“Everybody’s optimistic, Jon included, about how he feels right now and where this is headed,” Black said. “Even as early as Wednesday you might see him here on the field early facing some of our hitters. Thursday we’ll probably make a determination on what to do with Jon.”	Gray left his June 4 start against Oakland and there were initial fears he would face Tommy John surgery. An MRI was clean and he has been working his way back.	UP NEXT	Darvish (6-2, 2.28 ERA) will go for his first career win against Colorado when he faces RHP Chi Chi Gonzalez (2-4, 5.74) on Tuesday in the second of a three-game series.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- — Sean Murphy hit a two-run homer, Mitch Moreland had a two-run single and the Oakland Athletics held off the Los Angeles Angels 8-5 on Monday night.	Sean Manaea overcame an early home run and pitched into the sixth inning to help the AL West leaders improve to 41-27 – the best record for the A’s through 68 games since 2014.	“We’ve been able to string some hits together or create opportunities all year,” Moreland said. “When we’re able to score runs like that early, bunch them together, with our starters and our pitching staff, we’re going to win a lot of games. Tonight was proof of that.”	Juan Lagares hit his first home run of the season for the Angels, who had won six straight and eight of nine. David Fletcher and José Iglesias had four hits apiece.	Moreland singled off starter Dylan Bundy in the second for career hit No. 1,000. Murphy followed with his seventh home run, a towering drive to right. Moreland added his two-run single in the third.	Manaea (6-2) had five strikeouts in 5 2/3 innings and won his third straight. The lefty allowed nine hits and one run.	“They made him work,” A’s manager Bob Melvin said. “He gave up some hits but found a way to pitch around it and get some outs.”	Los Angeles rallied for four runs against Oakland's bullpen in the seventh. Jared Walsh had a two-run double and Fletcher singled to make it 8-5.	Jake Diekman struck out Walsh with two on to end the eighth. Lou Trivino retired three batters for his 11th save.	Bundy (1-7) ended a 10-start winless streak his last time out but struggled again. He allowed seven runs and five hits in 2 1/3 innings, raising his ERA to 6.98.	“Velocity was down, that was obvious,” Angels manager Joe Maddon said. “I don’t think his velocity played up to the point where the other pitches were effective. I just didn’t see that normal jump on the fastball.”	TROUT UNLIKELY ALL-STAR	Angels center fielder Mike Trout leads all American League outfielders and is second overall in the AL with 706,503 votes in All-Star balloting released Monday, although Maddon thinks it’s unlikely Trout would be able to play in the game. Trout has been on the injured list with a right calf strain since May 18 and is at least a month away from returning. The All-Star Game is July 13 at Coors Field in Colorado. “It would be kind of a stretch, I think, right now from what I’m hearing,” Maddon said. “Who knows how things could change? But you just really want to make sure that this injury is healed properly. Just to push it to get him in the All-Star Game to me would not be wise.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Angels: 3B Anthony Rendon injured his triceps diving for Chad Pinder’s double in the fifth. … Trout had another examination that showed things are headed in the right direction. “Eventually soon he’ll be able to jog a little bit, but the baseball activities are still a little far away,” Maddon said. … LHP José Quintana threw 25 pitches in a bullpen session and is nearing a return, according to Maddon.	Athletics: Pinder left after getting hit behind his left ear by an 82 mph splitter from Junior Guerra in the seventh. Pinder was down for several moments before being helped off the field. It was the second straight batter hit by a pitch from Guerra. “He’s not in concussion protocol right now,” Melvin said. “Pretty scary because he’s had a few concussion issues in the past. We’ll monitor him tonight.” … RHP J.B. Wendelken will begin a rehab assignment with Triple-A Las Vegas on Thursday as he works his way back from a strained left oblique. … CF Ramón Laureano (strained right hip) did some running and throwing in the outfield. Laureano will run the bases Tuesday and could be activated off the injured list Wednesday.	UP NEXT	RHP Frankie Montas (6-6, 4.37 ERA) faces the Angels for the second time this season Tuesday after a no-decision May 29 in Oakland. Los Angeles LHP Andrew Heaney (4-3, 4.37) has won his last three starts and has 19 strikeouts over his past 18 2/3 innings.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

SAN FRANCISCO -- — Brandon Crawford's big bat helped San Francisco finally snap out of an offensive funk as Arizona's road struggles kept going.	Crawford homered and drove in three runs as the Giants sent the Diamondbacks to their 20th straight road loss with a 5-2 victory Monday night.	“We’re in a grind right now. I don’t know where it’s at, what’s been happening or the reasons, but we’re working hard to figure that out,” Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said.	The D-backs moved closer to the dubious major league record for consecutive road defeats held by the 1963 New York Mets, who dropped 22 in a row away from the Polo Grounds. Arizona has lost 11 straight overall.	Alex Wood (6-3) won for the first time in five starts, allowing two runs and four hits in six innings, striking out seven. He snapped his three-game losing streak with his first win since May 16 at Pittsburgh.	Jake McGee closed it out for his 13th as the Giants improved to 19-6 following a loss. They haven’t dropped consecutive games since being swept at home by the Dodgers from May 21-23.	Curt Casali, 7 for 70 at the plate coming into his start to spell regular catcher Buster Posey, had three hits for the Giants.	Austin Slater’s RBI single in the eighth provided insurance for San Francisco following a four-game road split in Washington during which the Giants scored just three runs the entire series.	Crawford, who wasn't sure he would even play Monday after a long trip home, hit a two-run homer in the fifth for a 3-1 lead.	“Without Brandon Crawford we aren’t where we are right now,” Casali said.	Carson Kelly hit a solo homer and RBI double for Arizona.	San Francisco loaded the bases in the first with two out against Matt Peacock (2-4). After a mound visit, he induced Mike Tauchman’s inning-ending grounder.	Peacock was done after five innings for his third straight losing start.	Arizona hasn't won on the road since a 7-0 victory at Atlanta on April 25. This is the club's second double-digit losing streak this season after a 13-game skid from May 17-29.	"It’s challenging us, it really is," Kelly said.	San Francisco has won six straight against Arizona, going 11-2 in the NL West matchup since the beginning of the shortened 2020 season and 7-1 at home during that stretch.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: RHP Zac Gallen (sprained right elbow) is “getting close, that's a guy I think could win a Cy Young, so that's awesome," pitching coach Matt Herges said. ... RHP Luke Weaver isn't yet ready to throw as he works back from a strain in his pitching shoulder. "Luke Weaver is still in the treatment phase, he's still shut down," Lovullo said.	Giants: RHP Reyes Moronta (right flexor strain) began his throwing program and RHP Logan Webb (strained shoulder) was set to begin his Tuesday. ... OF Alex Dickerson could be on track to to be activated as soon as Saturday after nursing a strained upper back. ... Darin Ruf tested his strained right hamstring running the bases for the second time Monday while INF Tommy La Stella began the baserunning progression as he works back from a strained left hamstring. ... RHP Aaron Sanchez, dealing with tightness in his right biceps, is set to pitch three or four innings in a rehab appearance Thursday for Triple-A Sacramento.

SEATTLE -- — When Jake Bauers connected in the fifth inning, he was certain the ball was destined to leave the park only to see it caught on the warning track thanks to the heavy air and vast outfield of his new home field.	“I’ve had a few homers to center in my day and that was definitely on the list of something that I would say should be a homer,” Bauers said.	Three innings later Bauers had enough on his drive, barely clearing the wall in right-center field with his first home run since being traded to Seattle and lifted the Mariners to a 4-3 win over the Minnesota Twins on Monday night.	Bauers' third homer of the season was a tiebreaking, solo drive with one out in the eighth inning off reliever Hansel Robles (2-3). Bauers lined a 1-0 pitch just beyond the reach of Nick Gordon’s leaping attempt at the fence.	“That last one, I booked it a little bit because I thought I might have had a chance at a triple and then finally saw them signaling home run,” Bauers said.	Bauers was traded from Cleveland to Seattle last week after he was designated for assignment by the Indians earlier this month.	“There’s nothing better than contributing to your club and helping them win a few games,” Seattle manager Scott Servais said. “You feel like you belong. You’re making big impact as you get to know people and get to know our process and how we kind of go about things here. (I'm) excited for him.”	Seattle trailed 3-1, but scored twice in the fifth and the Mariners bullpen shut down the Twins long enough for Bauers to come through with the big hit.	JT Chargois and Paul Sewald (3-2) combined for three scoreless innings of relief and Drew Steckenrider pitched the ninth for his first save.	Jake Fraley was on base four times for Seattle, including an RBI single in the third. Ty France had an RBI double and Dylan Moore an RBI triple in the fifth for Seattle.	Minnesota’s runs came on Trevor Larnach’s RBI single in the first and home runs from Alex Kirilloff and Gilberto Celestino in the fourth. Kirilloff connected for the first time since May 2, while Celestino’s homer was the first of his major league career.	Neither Minnesota starter Kenta Maeda or Seattle’s Marco Gonzales were around to be involved in the decision.	Maeda was reinstated from his rehab at Triple-A to make his first start since May 22 due to an adductor strain. Maeda was going to be on a limited pitch count but was done after four innings.	Maeda struggled to get out of the first walking three consecutive batters in the opening inning, but recovered to get through four innings on 76 pitches and allowing one run. Maeda did snap his streak of 20 consecutive starts allowing two of fewer walks.	“My pitch count went up. That’s something that I should be able to fix in the next outing. But overall all my pitches were there today. I think it was great pitching in general,” Maeda said through an interpreter.	Gonzales managed to make it through five innings despite giving up hard contact and the homers to Kirilloff and Celestino. Gonzales was able to push his pitch count above 90 for the first time since missing more than a month with a forearm strain, but allowed eight hits.	“There were some pitches I tried to get a little bit more on and my finish was a little bit inconsistent in those counts,” Gonzales said. “Certainly not satisfied, a little frustrated in certain pitches, but a step in the right direction overall.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Twins: Along with activating Maeda, the Twins also reinstated INF/OF Luis Arraez from his rehab assignment after missing the past 19 games due to a right shoulder sprain. ... RHP Michael Pineda (right elbow inflammation) and OF Rob Refsnyder (left hamstring strain) went on the 10-day IL. Manager Rocco Baldelli said Pineda’s issue appears to be more muscular and where the forearm and elbow meet. ... OF Byron Buxton is with the team, but still may be a couple more days before he’s activated from the injured list.	Mariners: OF Mitch Haniger was out of the lineup Monday after fouling a pitch off his knee a day before and leaving the Mariners game in Cleveland. Based on his condition on Monday, Servais said he thinks Haniger will be able to avoid a trip to the injured list. ... Seattle traded RHP Yacksel Rios to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for cash. Rios was designated for assignment last week.	UP NEXT	Twins: LHP J.A. Happ (3-2, 5.75) makes his 12th start of the season. Happ has allowed at least four earned runs in five of his past six starts.	Mariners: RHP Chris Flexen (5-3, 4.68) will make his 12th start. Flexen has pitched at least six innings in his past three starts.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

LOS ANGELES -- — When Will Smith decided to praise every Dodgers reliever who came through against the Phillies, the catcher had a lengthy list to remember.	“DP (David Price) coming in, Joe (Kelly), Blake (Treinen), Victor (González), and Kenley (Jansen) closing it out, and Jimmy (Nelson),” Smith said. “They were all really good. They pounded the zone, put guys away, pitched out of a couple of jams. They were great tonight.”	Smith got his pitchers a bit out of order, but he was in perfect sync with all of them on the mound during yet another impressive win for the strong-armed World Series champs.	Smith hit a two-run homer, Chris Taylor added a solo shot and Los Angeles beat Philadelphia 3-1 on Monday night despite getting just three hits and four baserunners.	Pinch-hitter Albert Pujols' single in the seventh inning was the only other hit for the Dodgers, but they hung on for their sixth victory in seven games with eight consecutive scoreless innings from seven pitchers, including starter Tony Gonsolin.	Gonsolin yielded four hits and lasted just 3 2/3 rocky innings in his second start of the season, but his bullpen allowed only four singles and didn’t walk a batter.	Price (2-0) got the win after stranding two runners to end the fourth, and Jansen threw a perfect nine-pitch ninth for his 16th save.	“The bullpen won the ballgame for us,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. “They just kept throwing up zeros, and it was really fun to watch. Wasn’t much of a defensive game as far as making plays. These guys just made pitches. When we don’t swing the bats that great and still come away with the victory, it’s huge.”	Bryce Harper drove in a run in the first inning for the Phillies, whose four-game winning streak ended in the opener of a six-game California road trip. While Los Angeles struggled for any baserunners at all, Philadelphia stranded 10 while going 1 for 11 with runners in scoring position.	“We had some opportunities,” manager Joe Girardi said. “We didn’t cash in on them, and that was the difference in the game.”	Spencer Howard (0-2) tossed two-hit ball into the fifth for Philadelphia, but both those hits were homers. Howard, a native of central California, was otherwise sharp in his first career start in the stadium where he watched Éric Gagné and Clayton Kershaw as a kid with his father, a Los Angeles-area native.	Howard retired the Dodgers' first nine batters, and he even got his first major league hit in the second inning on a double when right fielder Zach McKinstry misread his line drive, which looked catchable.	But Mookie Betts drew a leadoff walk in the fourth, and Smith connected three batters later for his seventh homer, a 411-foot shot.	Taylor chased Howard with his ninth homer leading off the fifth.	GONSOLIN'S PROGRESS	Gonsolin missed the first two months of the season with right shoulder inflammation before returning to the Dodgers' rotation last week with a rough 1 2/3-inning start against Pittsburgh. The right-hander's 2021 has not gone as planned after he posted a 2.31 ERA in nine appearances last year and earned a shot at the rotation slot vacated by injured Dustin May this spring.	Gonsolin struggled from the opening pitches of his first home start of the season, allowing two hits and two walks in the first inning. Odúbel Herrera drew a leadoff walk, advanced on Jean Segura's double and scored on Harper's single.	Gonsolin struck out Alec Bohm with the bases loaded on his 30th pitch to hold Philadelphia to just one run in the first.	“It's always nice to get out of some possible damage,” Gonsolin said. “I was able to minimize that and keep it to one run, so that’s definitely a positive. But ultimately I’ve got to stop walking guys and throw more competitive pitches.”	Gonsolin left with two runners on in the fourth after getting a pair of generous third strike calls against Ronald Torreyes and Howard.	“It’s tough,” Girardi said. “I didn’t think we got much help from the umpire in the one inning with Torreyes and Spencer Howard.”	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: SS Didi Gregorius (right elbow inflammation) will resume his rehab assignment Tuesday. His elbow is still swollen and stiff, Girardi said.	Dodgers: OF Cody Bellinger missed his third straight game, and won't play until Wednesday at the earliest. The 2019 NL MVP isn't recovering as quickly as Los Angeles anticipated from left hamstring tightness. Bellinger has appeared in only 16 games this season.	UP NEXT	Zach Eflin (2-5, 3.89 ERA) takes the mound for Philadelphia against NL wins leader Julio Urías (9-2, 3.56), who has won five of his last six starts. The game also will be the first at full capacity for Dodger Stadium following California's overnight lifting of many COVID-19 safety measures.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

NEW YORK -- — When it comes to pitching at Citi Field, Taijuan Walker has an even better record this year than Jacob deGrom.	Walker struck out a career-high 12  and improved to 4-0 in six home starts, leading the New York Mets over the Chicago Cubs 3-2 on Tuesday night. Pete Alonso drove in three runs and center fielder Kevin Pillar and second baseman Luis Guillorme teamed on a thrilling relay to throw out Jake Marisnick at the plate in the ninth inning.	Walker has a 2.12 ERA, a big part of the NL East-leading Mets’ success — especially at Citi Field, where New York is 6-0 in his outings and matched its best 25-game start at 19-6.	“Today's outing was special, because he's been dealing with a stomach bug for the last couple days. And he actually hadn't been on site consistently,” Mets manager Luis Rojas said. “At the beginning of the game, his body language was kind of weird. He was like low energy, and then the next thing you know, it's the same Walker we see every outing."	Walker signed a $23 million, three-year contract with the Mets as a free agent, joining Marcus Stroman in a rotation headed by deGrom.	"It was the only offer I got, so that's probably why I signed with them," the 28-year-old right-hander said. "I feel like everything happens for a reason. And the Mets being my only offer, I feel like it was destiny for me to be here, honestly. And everything has worked out well for everyone. I'm actually really happy to be here, so I'm glad the Mets were my only offer."	Walker (6-2) allowed two runs and five hits in seven innings, walked none for the third time and reached 96.5 mph. Walker had struck out 11 seven times previously, all before he had Tommy John surgery on April 25, 2018.	“The velo going down maybe a little bit because of the surgery helped him develop the other pitches,” Rojas said. “And now the velo's back. ... We hit jackpot with this guy.”	DeGrom had a 0.56 ERA heading into his start against the Cubs on Wednesday night but is just 3-2 in six home starts, plagued by a lack of run support.	Javier Báez put the Cubs ahead 2-0 in the third with his 15th home run, driving a sinker to the opposite field in right-center. Alonso hit a two-run single in the bottom half and a sacrifice fly in the fifth.	Seth Lugo got six outs for his first save since returning on June 2 from elbow surgery, and the Mets (34-25) won for the fifth time in six games to move nine games over .500 for the first time since the end of the 2019 season.	Chicago, tied with Milwaukee for the NL Central lead, lost its second straight to the Mets after winning seven in a row at Citi Field going back to 2018.	Sixteen consecutive batters made out before Willson Contreras’ single with one out in the ninth. Jake Marisnick pinch ran and Eric Sogard singled to right-center. As Pillar ran down the ball and threw toward Guillorme, Cubs third base coach Willie Harris made the questionable decision to send Marisnick. Guillorme caught the ball in short right, made a quick turn and fired a one-hop throw to catcher James McCann. Marisnick made a head-first slide, and McCann tagged him on the left shoulder.	“I always err on the side of aggressiveness,” Cubs manager David Ross said. “I thought that was a really nice relay by Guillorme, almost a blind turn and throw to get our fastest baserunner trying to make something happen there late. I don't have a problem with that, at all.”	Lugo walked Jayson Heyward, then fanned rookie Sergio Alcántara for the Cubs’ season-high 15th strikeout.	Alec Mills (2-1) allowed three runs, five hits and two walks in 4 1/3 innings. Cubs pitchers walked six, raising their total to 14 in the first two games of the series.	“The numbers aren't great this year, but today I really felt like I got out to what I do best,” said Mills, who has a 6.11 ERA.	Cubs star Kris Bryant was hit by a pitch in the first inning and left in the middle of the second with what the team said was a bruised right hand. Bryant initially stayed in the game after he was hit by a first-pitch 93.4 mph sinker, then went to run at first base.	X-rays were negative.	“He couldn't really grip the bat," Ross said.	BAT COLLECTION	Báez, who missed the prior two starts and five of the previous seven because of a thumb injury, revealed that he switches bats after every home run.	“I keep all my home run bats since 2017, I think, so I've got all my home run bats in every season and I collect them and I've got them in my home,” he said. "Never use the same bat — I think only once, I did it only once in I think '19.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Mets: 2B Jeff McNeil (strained left hamstring) was 1 for 4 with two strikeouts and played second base as he moved up to Triple-A Syracuse from High-A Brooklyn. ... RHP Miguel Castro (neck) threw a partial bullpen.	UP NEXT	DeGrom (6-2) takes a 22-inning scoreless streak and a 0.56 ERA, the lowest in major league history through 10 starts, into his outing Wednesday against the Cubs and RHP Robert Stock (0-3, 4.12 at Triple-A), who will be selected from Triple-A Iowa to make his first big league appearance since last September with Boston. DeGrom left his outing Friday against San Diego with right flexor tendinitis.	------	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP--Sports	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

WASHINGTON -- — Yan Gomes connected for a grand slam and Trea Turner got four hits, leading Patrick Corbin and the Washington Nationals over the Pittsburgh Pirates 8-1 on Tuesday night.	The Nationals won their third in a row and sent Pittsburgh to its ninth straight loss.	Corbin (4-5) pitched 8 1/3 innings, allowing one run and eight hits. He struck out seven and walked one while going at least eight innings for the first time since Aug. 21, 2019.	“I felt the same that I have,” Corbin said. “It’s just been a frustrating first third of the season for me. Just continue to keep trying to work hard.”	Gomes’ slam finished a five-run first inning against Tyler Anderson (3-7).	“In those situations, I don’t know if you are thinking grand slam, but you are thinking hit it deep,” Gomes said.	It was Gomes’ first grand slam since joining the Nationals in 2019 and the fourth of his career.	“The pitches that (Anderson) made in the first weren’t bad pitches, they were just aggressive and put them in front of our outfielders," Pittsburgh manager Derek Shelton said. "The first inning was more about the grand slam than anything else.”	Kyle Schwarber led off the bottom of the first with one of three consecutive singles by the Nationals to start the inning. Ryan Zimmerman struck out with the bases loaded before Josh Harrison hit an RBI single and Gomes followed with his home run to left field.	The Nationals entered the game with a league-worst .460 OPS with the bases loaded this season. They'd hit one other grand slam — Josh Harrison against Baltimore — before Gomes connected. Prior to that, Washington had struck out 21 times and picked up only eight hits with the bases loaded in 2021.	Turner's first triple of the season made it 6-0 in the fourth.	Phillip Evans doubled home the Pirates’ run in the seventh.	“Fun night,” Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. “Fun night for us. Let’s keep it going.”	MANAGERS READY FOR STICKY SITUATION TO END	Major League Baseball announced Tuesday it will begin cracking down on the use of “sticky stuff” by pitchers on June 21. Both managers in this game were glad at least the rules will be clear.	“MLB is trying to level the playing field,” Martinez said. “They’re trying to find some consistent balance for everyone. My biggest concern is the health of the players. We’re going to have to navigate through this for a few days.”	Shelton was focused on making sure his players were informed of the new changes that prevent anything other than rosin being used to help grip the baseball.	“I don’t want anybody to be in an ambiguous situation where they weren’t aware of what the enforcement might be,” Shelton said.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Pirates: Pittsburgh 3B Colin Moran remains day-to-day after leaving Sunday’s game because of lower back tightness. Shelton said Moran is moving around better. Moran has played 38 of the Pirates’ 65 games this season coming into Tuesday.	Nationals: RHP Austin Voth (nose fracture) threw 23 pitches Tuesday in a simulated game. Voth was placed on the 10-day injured list June 8 (retroactive to June 7) after being struck in the face by a pitch. Martinez said Voth will be put back into the bullpen, as opposed to the rotation, when he returns. The Nationals want to be sure he is comfortable handling balls hit back at him before he pitches again in a game.	UP NEXT	Pittsburgh sends RHP Chase De Jong (0-0, 4.80 ERA) to the mound in game three of the three-game series. The Nationals are unsure who their Wednesday starter will be. Max Scherzer was scheduled to pitch Wednesday, but was placed on the 10-day injured list Tuesday because of groin inflammation.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

BUFFALO, N.Y. -- — Clint Frazier snapped an eighth-inning tie with a pinch-hit double and the New York Yankees hit three solo homers in a much-needed 6-5 win over the Toronto Blue Jays on Tuesday night.	Frazier ripped a line drive inside the third-base line to score pinch-runner Tyler Wade from second as the Yankees completed a comeback from a 5-2 deficit and won for the third time in 10 games. The game was played before a Buffalo crowd of 7,145, mostly in support of New York.	“I was trying to be disciplined and hit a fastball," Frazier said after coming through against reliever Jordan Romano. “I was a little bit early on it and just glad to keep it inside the base. The most important thing we've done as a team is stick together. We're trying to go out and win ballgames and tonight it took everybody.”	Chris Gittens homered for his first major league hit, Gary Sánchez socked a leadoff homer in the second and Brett Gardner added a leadoff shot in the seventh that brought the Yankees to 5-4.	“I touched first base and my mind just went blank," Gittens said. “I didn’t care if it was a home run or a base hit, a little squibber. That was an amazing feeling."	Gardner made a bold prediction as Gittens went to the plate.	“Gardy walked by me five seconds before, and said, 'Skip, he’s going deep,'” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. “He's had some competitive at-bats and to finally step on one and get us closer was big.”	Bo Bichette homered and had a two-run single for the Blue Jays. Santiago Espinal added three hits for Toronto, which has lost four of six.	“The bullpen didn't do the job,” manager Charlie Montoyo said. “Everybody's getting a chance to pitch in high-leverage. We have to trust them. And they'll get their chance tomorrow.”	Jonathan Loaisiga (6-2) worked one inning to earn the win. Tim Mayza (1-1) allowed a leadoff single to Miguel Andújar in the eighth and took the loss. Aroldis Chapman worked a perfect ninth for his 13th save.	Toronto starter Hyun Jin Ryu limited New York to five hits over six innings, but issued a season-high four walks.	Jordan Montgomery allowed five hits and four walks with four strikeouts over 6 1/3 innings for New York.	Bichette led off the third with his 14th homer to give Toronto a 2-1 lead. Gittens countered with a 439-foot shot to left-center in the fourth that tied it at 2.	Toronto took a 3-2 lead in the fourth when Joe Panik scored on a passed ball, and went up 5-2 on Bichette's single.	DJ LeMahieu scored on Anthony Castro's wild pitch in the seventh to tie the game at 5.	The Blue Jays threatened in the eighth, loading the bases with two outs before Bichette flied out.	TRIPLE CROWN CHASE	Toronto slugger Vladimir Guerrero Jr. began the day leading the American League in batting average (.346), home runs (22) and RBI (56). According to the Elias Sports Bureau, he is the first 22-year-old since Al Kaline in 1955 to lead in all three categories after 60 or more games.	Guerrero went 1 for 4 and grounded out against Chapman on a full-count pitch.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Yankees: Boone said RHP Luis Severino, who left in the second inning of a rehab appearance Saturday, has a Grade 2 groin strain and went back to New York to work on a treadmill and keep active. Boone added that Severino's comeback from February 2020 Tommy John surgery, recently projected to be in late June, will now be delayed by another month. ... RHP Clarke Schmidt (elbow strain) threw another bullpen, and Boone said Schmidt used all his pitches but he had no timeframe for starting a rehab assignment. ... 1B Luke Voit had his rehab assignment transferred from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to Double-A Somerset.	Blue Jays: OF George Springer (quadriceps), in his first rehab game at Triple-A, played five innings for the Buffalo Bisons in Rochester and went 0 for 4. ... RHP Carl Edwards Jr. left after throwing only five pitches in the seventh with left side abdominal discomfort. He will have an MRI on Wednesday. ... C Danny Jansen (hamstring) took batting practice and has made enough progress that Montoyo said Jansen is close to returning. ... Montoyo also said LHP Ryan Borucki (forearm strain) began playing catch.	UP NEXT	The series continues Wednesday night, with Yankees RHP Gerrit Cole (7-3, 2.31 ERA) taking on Toronto RHP Ross Stripling (2-3, 4.91).	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CLEVELAND -- — Eddie Rosario delivered a two-run double and Bobby Bradley hit a solo homer as the Cleveland Indians beat Baltimore 7-2 Tuesday night, sending the Orioles to their 17th straight road loss.	The Orioles committed four errors and moved closer to the major league record of 22 consecutive road losses, shared by the 1943 Philadelphia Athletics and 1963 New York Mets.	They've made six errors in the first two games of the series at Progressive Field.	“When you have to get four outs in an inning, it’s really a challenge because we’re not an offense that can make up for it,” Baltimore manager Brandon Hyde said. “We’re playing a little tight defensively because we’re not playing with a ton of confidence.”	Amed Rosario had three hits, stole a base and drove in a run for Cleveland, which never trailed in winning for the fourth time in five games. The Indians are a season-high eight games over .500 despite having ace Shane Bieber and slugger Franmil Reyes on the injured list.	“The whole group we have is banding together for this long ride,” Bradley said. “There is no better feeling than seeing your teammates contribute.”	Eddie Rosario’s double off Cole Sulser highlighted a five-run fourth inning that gave the Indians a 6-1 lead. Bradley singled home a run in the first and hammered a towering solo shot to right in the seventh off Adam Plutko.	Bradley is batting .440 with three home runs and 10 RBI in eight games since being recalled from Triple-A Columbus. In his previous stint with the Indians in 2019, he hit .178 and struck out 20 times in 45 at-bats.	“The first time I was up here, I put way too much pressure on myself,” Bradley said. “I feel like I belong now and I’m having way too much fun, just playing some summer ball.”	The Indians used six pitchers with James Karinchak (4-2) gaining the win by striking out all three batters he faced in the eighth. Cal Quantrill worked the first four innings, allowing one run and striking out four.	“We’ve got a very deep team and you’re going to see a whole lot of everybody on the field,” Quantrill said.	Freddy Galvis singled twice and Trey Mancini and Maikel Franco had run-scoring doubles for Baltimore, which has the worst record in the AL at 22-44. Stevie Wilkerson made two errors at second base and had three of the Orioles’ 14 strikeouts.	Baltimore starter Matt Harvey (3-8) suffered his career-high seventh straight loss and gave up six runs, five earned, in 3 1/3 innings.	The Indians opened the fourth with three hits off Harvey, including Ernie Clement’s first in the majors. He was chased by Amed Rosario’s RBI single that made it 4-1.	BIEBER UPDATE	Reigning AL Cy Young winner Bieber (right shoulder strain) said increased pain prompted the Indians to place him on the 10-day injured list Monday. He has been bothered by shoulder irritation for most of the season, but became concerned when it extended to a different area of his upper arm. “That’s generally not a good sign,” said Bieber, who is 7-4 with a 3.28 ERA in 14 starts. “It made things a little bit dangerous, a little bit sketchy, so we’re giving the shoulder a little break.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Orioles: LHP John Means (left shoulder strain) played catch Tuesday for the first time since going on the injured list on June 6. Hyde said Means will continue to rehab in Sarasota, Florida, for the time being.	Indians: C Roberto Pérez (right ring finger fracture) and RHP Zach Plesac (right thumb fracture) will be examined by the team’s hand specialist this weekend in Pittsburgh. Pérez had three pins placed in his finger in early May.	UP NEXT	Orioles: LHP Keegan Akin (0-1, 4.13 ERA) worked five scoreless innings in his first start against Cleveland on June 4, scattering three hits.	Indians: RHP Aaron Civale (9-2, 3.17 ERA) has only walked four over his last five outings, posting a 4-1 record with a 2.83 ERA in 35 innings.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ATLANTA -- — Red Sox manager Alex Cora thinks a lot of people aren't impressed with his team despite its 41-27 record.	“We show up, we love playing the game and we know we’ll be answering questions throughout the season and rightfully so," he said. “We’re not that great. We just have a good baseball team and we just keep getting better."	Alex Verdugo hit a tiebreaking, three-run homer off Chris Martin in the eighth inning, Rafael Devers added a three-run homer and drove in four runs, and the Red Sox beat the Atlanta Braves 10-8 on Tuesday night.	Xander Bogaerts’ 13th homer made it 6-4 in the fifth inning as Boston improved to 36-4, best in the major leagues, when scoring at least four runs. The Red Sox have won four of six overall.	Devers, who went 3 for 5, doubled in the fifth and scored on Hunter Renfroe’s single to make it 7-4. Devers stayed hot after beginning the game ranked among the top 10 in the majors in RBI, extra-base hits, doubles, homers, slugging percentage and total bases.	Verdugo's ninth homer came with two outs and made it 10-7. Martin (0-3) gave up three hits and three runs.	“Off the bat, I knew I hit it well, but the ball just kept carrying," Verdugo said. “I was fortunate enough to get it over the fence. The thought process behind that at-bat was the at-bat before I chased an offspeed pitch and hit it weakly to first base. My goal was just basically let the ball get deep, let it travel and try to stay up the middle as best I could."	Martin credited Verdugo with taking advantage of his mistake.	“I missed by a lot," Martin said. “I was trying to throw a splitter down and I knew I had a base open and obviously a good hitter on deck. I like both matchups, but I just didn’t make the pitch. I left the pitch up in the zone and he did damage."	Hirokazu Sawamura (3-0) earned the win after facing the minimum in the seventh. Matt Barnes earned his 15th save in 18 chances after facing five batters and giving up a run in the ninth.	The Red Sox led 4-0 in the first against rookie Tucker Davidson when Kike Hernández and Verdugo singled and Devers hit his 16th homer, a 435-foot shot to center. Renfroe followed with his eighth homer as the Sox went back-to-back.	Boston went up 5-0 in the third as J.D. Martinez hit a stand-up triple and scored on Devers’ single off Sean Newcomb.	Red Sox starter Eduardo Rodriguez allowed four runs and six hits in four innings.	“We had a five-run lead and you saw what happened," Cora said. “He had the bottom of the lineup and he didn’t do his job. I think early on he established his fastball in, he did a good job and then wasn’t able to execute."	Braves rookie Tucker Davidson began the game having pitched 11 2/3 consecutive scoreless innings before suffering left forearm tightness and leaving with one out in the third and runners on the corners. He allowed five hits, five runs and one walk with four strikeouts, and manager Brian Snitker said Davidson will likely go on the injured list on Wednesday.	Atlanta, which has dropped five of six, trimmed the lead to 5-1 in the third on Freddie Freeman’s RBI single and 5-4 in the three-run fourth on Abraham Almonte’s RBI double and Ronald Acuña Jr.’s two-run double.	The Braves tied it at 7-all in the three-run sixth on Guillermo Heredia's RBI single, catcher Christian Vazquez's passed ball with the bases loaded and Freeman's sacrifice fly. Two of the runs were unearned.	“It was an ugly win, but it was a big-league win," Cora said after watching his team commit three errors. “We kept putting up good at-bats and in the end the bullpen shut down the door, but it wasn’t pretty."	TRAINER’S ROOM	Red Sox: LHP Chris Sale (Tommy John recovery) threw a bullpen session at Triple-A Worcester. ... RHP Tanner Houck (right flexor muscle) will pitch three innings at Worcester on Thursday.	Braves: Acuña, who went 2 for 5, was back in the lineup after tweaking a pectoral muscle and leaving Sunday's win at Miami. ... Snitker said the team has yet to discuss how RHP Mike Soroka (Achilles) will be used when he’s cleared to return. Snitker added that Soroka has yet to start throwing yet after his most recent setback and that it’s premature to speculate.	BE CAREFUL	Cora, who served a year’s suspension for his role in the Houston Astros’ sign-stealing scandal, has pressed home the importance to Boston pitchers about being careful not to violate Major League Baseball’s new rules that ban foreign substances being wiped on balls. Beginning Monday, pitchers are subject to ejection and a 10-game suspension if caught by umpires.	“I know how embarrassing that is and how tough that is, not only on you as a person but your family, your friends and the people that love you,” Cora said. “Ten games, a year, two years, three years — it doesn’t matter. Being suspended is hell, and you don’t want to go through that. I was very open with them, and hopefully they understand that.”	IMPRESSIVE	Boston improved to 19-0 when scoring seven runs or more.	UP NEXT	Red Sox RHP Garrett Richards (4-4, 4.09 ERA) faces RHP Ian Anderson (4-3, 3.26) in the finale of the two-game series.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

MILWAUKEE -- — The Cincinnati Reds broke open a scoreless game in the 10th inning without the benefit of a hit and held on to beat the Milwaukee Brewers 2-1 on Tuesday night.	Brett Anderson worked seven innings of one-hit ball for Milwaukee and combined with three relievers on a two-hitter, but it all fell apart for Brad Boxberger (2-2) in the 10th.	Boxberger hit Tyler Stephenson with a pitch and walked Joey Votto to load the bases. Then he hit Eugenio Suárez with a pitch to score Nick Castellanos, who started the inning at second base. Stephenson scored on a sacrifice fly by Kyle Farmer.	Boxberger “just didn’t have a feel for his changeup,” Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. “It wasn’t like crisp to the first couple hitters, really, and they got two guys on base.”	Cincinnati, which has won five straight and 10 of 12, also was outstanding on the mound. Luis Castillo allowed three hits in seven scoreless innings, and four relievers completed the four-hitter. Lucas Sims (4-1) pitched a scoreless ninth and Amir Garrett got the final out for his third save.	The Brewers' Daniel Robertson had a two-out RBI single in the 10th off Heath Hembree.	“I just feel like tonight we did what it took to grind out a win,” Reds manager David Bell said. “It wasn’t easy.”	The teams combined to strike out 27 times on the day Major League Baseball said it would crack down on pitchers using illegal foreign substances to improve their grip and throw pitches with more spin. Neither team got a runner past second base until the sixth inning.	Castillo came in with the most losses (nine) and highest ERA (6.47) among major league starters but had little trouble with a Brewers lineup that entered Tuesday with the lowest batting average and most strikeouts in the NL. He struck out seven and walked three.	Anderson hasn't won since April 17. He struck out nine and walked one.	“Incredible,” Castillo said through a translator. “When two starters are going at each other, battling it out, you hardly ever see it that much anymore.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Reds: Sent 3B Mike Moustakas (right heel contusion) to Triple-A Louisville on a rehabilitation assignment. He was placed on the 10-day injured list on May 20.	Brewers: Counsell said LHP Angel Perdomo (lower back strain), who went on the 10-day IL on May 30, will be sent to Triple-A Nashville when the team departs for a series against Colorado that starts Thursday. Counsell said he expects 2B Kolten Wong (strained left oblique), who went on the 10-day IL on June 4, to be activated during that series. ... Entering Tuesday, Milwaukee had used 46 players this season, second in the majors to Seattle’s 51.	FOREIGN SUBSTANCES	“If you follow the rules, you don't have to worry about anything.” — Milwaukee right-hander Freddy Peralta on MLB's new enforcement of the foreign-substance rules.	UNRETRACTABLE ROOF	On June 15, 1944, a storm ripped off a 120-foot section of the grandstand roof at Milwaukee’s Borchert Field, injuring at least 31 people attending a game between the Brewers and the Columbus Red Birds, according to a Milwaukee Sentinel report at the time. The teams were part of the American Association minor league. The major league Brewers began playing in Milwaukee in 1970.	SNAPPY DEFENSE	Brewers SS Willy Adames, acquired from Tampa Bay in a trade on May 21, went deep in the hole between shortstop and third to backhand a grounder, leaped and threw against his body to Daniel Vogelbach, who scooped the throw out of the dirt to retire Suárez and end the second.	UP NEXT	Cincinnati RHP Tyler Mahle (6-2, 3.56 ERA) faces Peralta (6-1, 2.25 ERA) on Wednesday as the Reds seek a three-game sweep. Mahle has won each of his previous four starts, while Peralta has given up one run in each of his past three.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- — Casey Mize turned in his eighth quality start in his last nine games, Miguel Cabrera got two more hits and the Detroit Tigers beat Kansas City 4-2 Tuesday night, the Royals’ fifth straight loss.	Mize (4-4) allowed three runs on seven hits in 6 2/3 innings. Gregory Soto pitched the ninth for his sixth save in as many chances.	“The quality is more important than the length,” Detroit manager A.J. Hinch said. “Casey came out and had to battle. I think he got a little better as the game went along.	“He had to fight a little bit to find his rhythm. At the beginning of the day if you said he was going to pitch into the seventh and give up three runs you’d feel good about it.”	After the Tigers had to use nine pitchers in Monday’s game, Mize knew he had to go as deep as possible.	“Coming into today I knew that was really important,” Mize said. “That was definitely something I was thinking about. I was trying to be efficient.”	Cabrera, stuck in a slump for most of the season, doubled and singled to drive in one run and score another. He had three hits in Monday night’s win over the Royals.	Mike Minor (5-4) gave up four runs and seven hits in 5 2/3 innings. The Royals have lost 10 of 11 and haven’t led at any point since beating Oakland six games ago.	“I felt we did a good job fighting our way back in,” Kansas City manager Mike Matheny said. “We got a little something going, with some good situational hitting. I know things are going to change. But right now, it’s just not happening.”	Cabrera put the Tigers on top in the first with an RBI single. He has 246 career hits against the Royals, his second most against any opponent (258, Cleveland).	Jonathan Schoop’s two-run homer in the third gave the Tigers a 3-0 lead.	Mize helped the Royals get back in the game in the bottom of the third. Nicky Lopez and Whit Merrifield singled with one out, and both runners advanced on a wild pitch.	Lopez scored on a groundout by Carlos Santana and Mize then hit Salvador Perez with a pitch and walked Jorge Soler, loading the bases. Mize’s second wild pitch scored Merrifield.	Cabrera doubled in the sixth and scored on Daz Cameron’s hit off reliever Kyle Zimmer.	The Royals cut the lead to one run in the seventh on Lopez’s bloop single.	ROSTER NEWS	Tigers: LHP Matthew Boyd was placed on the 10-day injured list with left-arm discomfort. He came out of Monday’s start in the third inning. ...

Royals: RHP Brady Singer (3-5, 4.85) will get the ball for Kansas City. He took a no-decision against Oakland in his last outing. He allowed three runs over six innings, with seven strikeouts. He’s 2-0 with a no-decision against the Tigers in 2021.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO -- — Dallas Keuchel pitched seven innings of crisp four-hit ball to win his fifth straight decision, leading the Chicago White Sox past the Tampa Bay Rays 3-0 on Tuesday night.	Adam Engel hit a solo home run and Tim Anderson had three hits as the White Sox bounced back from a 5-2 loss on Monday in matchup of the teams with the two best records in the majors.	Danny Mendick drove in a run and set up another as Chicago won for the fifth time in six and ended Tampa Bay’s four-game winning streak.	Keuchel (6-1) was sharp throughout this one, striking out five and walking one.	“He was Picasso, just painted it beautifully,” manager Tony La Russa said. “Shut out that club for seven innings.”	Keuchel seemed almost back in his 2015 Cy Young form as he pitched quickly and nipped corners.	“It just felt really natural, really consistent in terms of my mechanics and the ball coming out of my hand,” the left-hander said. "I'd like to end the first half (of the season) with a real consistent run.	“I targeted June for myself for really turning the gas on, so we'll take what we've had for the last few outings," he said.	Aaron Bummer pitched a scoreless eighth and Liam Hendriks worked around two singles in the ninth for his 18th save.	The White Sox and Rays entered with the two lowest team ERAs in the AL, but Tampa Bay’s rotation took a hit after an MRI showed ace Tyler Glasnow had a partial tear in an elbow ligament and a flexor strain. The right-hander said he won’t have surgery for now, and instead will try to strengthen the area.	Mendick played second base in place of rookie Nick Madrigal, who underwent season-ending surgery earlier in the day to repair tears in his right hamstring.	Rays rookie Shane McClanahan (2-2) allowed two earned runs on seven hits in five innings. Not bad, but no match for Keuchel, Rays manager Kevin Cash said after his team was shut out for the third time this season.	“This team has been on a great roll,” Cash said. “It speaks to what Dallas Keuchel and their relievers did.”	“We've got some guys who can handle left-handing pitching, but we've got to do something about that," he said.	Mendick grounded a sharp single with two outs in the fourth to drive in Andrew Vaughn from second. Leury Garcia scored from first when left fielder Randy Arozarena’s throw skipped under catcher Francisco Mejía.	Engel led off the fifth with his third homer in seven games since coming off the injured list to make it 3-0.	WACHA IN	With Glasnow out, Cash plans to insert veteran righty Michael Wacha into Tampa Bay’s rotation.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Rays: Cash confirmed there was no timeline for Glasnow’s return and that the team would seek additional opinions. Tampa Bay put the righty on the 10-day injured list and recalled infielder Mike Brosseau from Triple-A Durham.	White Sox: RHP Michael Kopech, who hasn’t pitched since May 26 (strained left hamstring) threw off the mound on Tuesday. … 3B Yoán Moncada sat out a second game (bad cold symptoms) and it's unlikely he'll start Wednesday, La Russa said. ...Madrigal was hurt last week trying to beat out a grounder and the White Sox held out hope he might recover to play again this year.	UP NEXT	The Rays start LHP Ryan Yarbrough (4-3. 3.63) against White Sox RHP Lucas Giolito (5-5, 3.81) in the series finale on Wednesday afternoon.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.

HOUSTON -- — Houston manager Dusty Baker capped his 72nd birthday in grand fashion, thanks to a slam by Jose Altuve in the 10th inning on Tuesday night.	“That was a wonderful birthday present," Baker said.	Altuve belted a grand slam and the Houston Astros, saved by Carlos Correa's tying homer in the ninth, beat the Texas Rangers 6-3.	After Texas drove in the automatic runner in the top of the 10th for a 3-2 lead, Rangers rookie reliever Demarcus Evans (0-2) walked Myles Straw and pinch-hitter Jason Castro to load the bases with no outs in the bottom half.	Altuve then launched his soaring shot into left field to put the Astros on top and start the party.	Altuve was doused with water at home plate before sharing a hug with Baker, who noted that he's had terrible luck in games on his birthday in the past.	“The first thing Altuve said to me was: ‘Happy birthday, Skip,'" Baker said. “And that certainly was a happy birthday."	Added Altuve: “I know he wants to win on his birthday, so I’m happy that I did something to make that happen."	It was the first walk-off grand slam in the majors this season. The Astros hadn't had a last at-bat grand slam since Aug. 16, 2011, when Brian Bogusevic, who was at the park Tuesday as a television analyst, connected off Carlos Marmol in a 6-5 win over the Cubs.	Texas manager Chris Woodward said things began to unravel for Evans way before Altuve's shot.	“You put the winning run on first base and you’re asking for it," he said. “He has good enough stuff that he could have punched out Castro and maybe gotten Altuve. (Evans) has got to be better than that."	Correa hit a solo homer to the opposite field shot with two outs and two strikes in the ninth off Josh Sborz, making it 2-all.	“We fight through the last out," Altuve said. “Correa hit that homer, which was the key to the game for me."	Nate Lowe’s RBI single off Ryan Pressly (3-1) with two outs in the 10th put the Rangers up.	Joey Gallo had an RBI double off Lance McCullers Jr. in the fourth and a bases-loaded walk in the fifth to give the Rangers a 2-0 lead.	A sacrifice fly by Yuli Gurriel got the Astros within a run in the sixth.	Kyle Gibson allowed seven hits and a run over six innings in his 13th start and third since coming off the injured list for Texas.	McCullers yielded three hits and one earned run in 4 1/3 innings in his return from the injured list. He had been out since May 23 because of soreness in his right shoulder.	“I felt solid," McCullers said. “It just got away from me a little bit in the fifth with the two walks. I did a good job of keeping it close."	Altuve hit an infield single with no outs in the sixth before Michael Brantley singled on a comebacker that hit Gibson on the back of the right leg. Gibson was a bit shaken up on the play and was checked on by a trainer before throwing a few warmup pitches and remaining in the game.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Astros: OF Kyle Tucker missed the game with an undisclosed illness. ... Castro (left Achilles tendon soreness) was activated from the injured list on Tuesday. ... C Garrett Stubbs and RHP Nivaldo Rodriguez were optioned to Triple-A Sugar Land to make room for McCullers and Castro on the roster.	DAVIS BECOMES FREE AGENT	Rangers OF Khris Davis, who was designated for assignment on June 8, cleared unconditional release waivers on Tuesday and became a free agent. Davis hit just .157 in 22 games this season in his first year in Texas after a trade from Oakland.	DOCTORED BASEBALLS	MLB announced on Tuesday that beginning on Monday, pitchers will be ejected and suspended for 10 games for using illegal foreign substances to doctor baseballs. Rangers general manager Chris Young, who pitched in the majors for 13 seasons, was involved in discussions about this issue while working in the league office before being hired by the Rangers in December.	“I think what maybe used to be a pitcher putting on a little bit of a tacky substance to improve the feel for the baseball became truly performance enhancing,” he said. “And I think it crossed the line that, now it’s really impacting the game on the field, the style of play. And I think that it probably had gotten too far out of control. And that’s why Major League Baseball has decided to really crack down on this.”	UP NEXT	Texas right-hander Jordan Lyles (2-4, 5.37 ERA) will oppose Zack Greinke (6-2, 3.68) when the series wraps up on Wednesday night.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

ST. LOUIS -- — Paul Goldschmidt hit a game-ending homer in the ninth inning and drove in both St. Louis runs as the Cardinals beat the Miami Marlins 2-1 on Tuesday night.	St. Louis has won two in a row against the Marlins after dropping nine of 10 overall.	Miami lost its third straight.	Goldschmidt, who had a tying RBI single in the sixth, led off the ninth and fell behind 1-2 in the count before he drilled a 98 mph fastball from Yimi Garcia (3-5) to right-center field for his sixth career walk-off home run. The previous one also came against the Marlins in June 2019 to give St. Louis a 2-1 victory in 11 innings.	“Honestly, I was trying to shorten up just to put something in play,” Goldschmidt said. “I told myself before I walked up there, just not try and do too much.”	St. Louis won back-to-back games for the first time since May 28-29 against Arizona.	Alex Reyes (4-2) worked a scoreless ninth for the win.	Miami took a 1-0 lead on a run-scoring single by Adam Duvall in the third. He drove in Starling Marte, who walked to begin the inning	Goldschmidt tied the game with a two-out, two-strike hit in the sixth. Pinch-hitter Jose Rondon began the rally with a one-out single.	"I treat every game as though I'm starting,” Rondon said. “I treat every day like I'm in the lineup.”	St. Louis manager Mike Shildt felt Rondon's hit was the key to the tying rally.	“It's a 26-man roster for a reason, right?” Shildt said.	Miami starter Trevor Rogers allowed one run and three hits over six innings. He struck out six and walked one.	Rogers has held opponents to one run or none in eight of his 14 starts this season.	“Just giving them a good mix of all of my pitches,” Rogers said. “Changeup was on, fastball (moved) in and out.”	St. Louis starter Kwang Hyun Kim also gave up one run and three hits in six innings. He struck out six and walked five.	Kim was coming off a short stint on the 10-day injured list after he developed lower back stiffness while running the bases in his last start on June 4 against Cincinnati. It was his first quality start of the season.	“Later in the game, I was better than early in the game,” Kim said. “Something positive."	St. Louis outfielder Tyler O'Neill stretched his career-best on-base streak to 21 games with a second-inning walk.	ROAD WARRIOR	Miami first baseman Jesus Aguilar has hit all 12 of his home runs on the road this season. He is the first player to do that since Jose Abreu hit his first 13 homers on the road for the Chicago White Sox in 2017.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Marlins: OF Corey Dickerson was placed on the 10-day injured list with a bruised left foot sustained while running the bases in a 6-4 loss to Atlanta on Sunday. Jesus Sanchez was recalled from Triple-A Jacksonville to replace Dickerson.	Cardinals: INF Tommy Edman was a late scratch due to right side tightness. He is day-to-day. "We don’t think it’s overly serious,” Shildt said.	UP NEXT	St. Louis RHP Johan Oviedo (0-2, 5.72 ERA) faces RHP Sandy Alcantara (4-5, 3.39) in the finale of the three-game set Wednesday afternoon. Oviedo will be making his first appearance against the Marlins. He allowed four earned runs in 4 1/3 innings of an 8-5 loss to the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field on Friday. Alcantara has allowed two runs or fewer in four of his last five starts.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

DENVER -- — Ryan McMahon homered, tripled and drove in four runs as the Colorado Rockies rallied from an early deficit to beat the skidding San Diego Padres 8-4 Tuesday night.	Fernando Tatis Jr. hit his NL-leading 20th home run of the season for San Diego, which has lost 11 of 15.	McMahon went 3 for 3 with a sacrifice fly and Yonathan Daza had three hits. Raimel Tapia doubled twice and drove in the go-ahead run in the seventh.	Adjustments in his swing and the length of the bat that he used have made a difference for McMahon. He downsized his bat slightly, from 34 inches in length to 33.75 inches this year and also has been choking up, especially with two strikes, to cut down on strikeouts and quicken his swing, which has become more explosive.	“Mac realized if he can cut his strikeouts down and put the ball in play, he’s got a swing that can generate some power,” Rockies manager Bud Black said. “I think you saw that tonight.”	Said McMahon: “I’ve been choking up a little bit. When you shorten up and take that good short swing to the ball, it’s going to pay off more often than not.”	It was 4-all when Garrett Hampson, pinch-hitting for reliever Carlos Estévez (1-0), tripled off Tim Hill (3-3) in the seventh. Tapia followed with a double, extending his hitting streak to 12 games, and scored on a sacrifice fly by McMahon.	The Padres gave starter Yu Darvish a 4-0 lead after two innings, but he couldn't hold it. He allowed four runs and five hits in five-plus innings.	Colorado closed to 4-2 in the fourth when Trevor Story doubled, McMahon tripled and Brendan Rodgers singled.	Colorado tied it in the sixth as Story opened the inning with a walk and McMahon connected for his 16th home run of the season, chasing Darvish.	Chi Chi Gonzalez, who allowed three home runs during Colorado’s 11-4 loss at Miami last time out, surrendered a two-out double to Manny Machado, followed by Tatis’ first-pitch drive 431 feet into the Rockies bullpen behind the center field fence.	San Diego added two more runs in the second after Jake Croneworth singled and Jurickson Profar doubled, snapping an 0-for-21 slump. Victor Caratini had an RBI groundout and Darvish followed with a single to drive in his first run of the season.	Gonzalez rebounded from a shaky start to go six innings, allowing four runs on six hits. “The first couple of innings, I thought we squared the ball up really well, did some damage got some runs up,” Padres manager Jayce Tingler said. “Then Chi Chi settled in and we got a little bit cold, so we just weren’t able to add on.”	ROCKY MOUNTAIN HIGHS	The game-time temperature at Coors Field was 98 degrees for the second straight evening. It’s the first time that the Rockies had consecutive game-time temperatures of at least 98 degrees. They’re the second highest game-time temperatures at home in the team’s history, behind a 100-degree game on June 25, 2012 versus Washington.	TWO BY TWO	All the runs scored in pairs. Colorado had four two-run innings, the Padres had a pair of two-run frames. KEEPING THE FAITH “You have to embrace, in this game, the struggles and the challenges in it,” Tingler said. "If you don’t do it, this game will eat you alive. So we’re going to continue to be upbeat. We’re going to continue to be energetic. We’re going to continue to play baseball and this thing is going to turn. “	UP NEXT	LHP Blake Snell (2-3, 4.97 ERA) is set to start Wednesday’s series finale for the Padres against Colorado LHP Kyle Freeland (0-2, 9.00), who is making his fifth start since being reinstated May 25 from the injured list. Freeland has not gone beyond the fifth inning in any of his previous starts this season.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- — Frankie Montas induced Shohei Ohtani’s inning-ending double play in the third, then struck out the two-way star with three splitters low in the zone to finish the fifth.	Sure, Ohtani hit his 18th homer late — but he did minimal damage at the plate overall, and that’s certainly a mark of success for any Angels opponent.	Sean Murphy homered for the second consecutive night, Elvis Andrus hit a two-run double and Montas pitched the Oakland Athletics past Los Angeles 6-4 on Tuesday for their fifth straight win.	Montas enjoyed those battles with Ohtani, even though there was some added anxiety with runners on base.	“He was probably expecting fastballs,” Montas said of the strikeout. “He was swinging. He was trying to drive in a run.”	Montas (7-6) struck out eight with one walk over seven innings to win for the second time in six starts. He allowed two runs and five hits, including RBI singles by Justin Upton and David Fletcher.	“There’s no give up in Frankie,” second baseman Tony Kemp said. “It’s a blessing to play behind him.”	Ohtani homered with two outs in the eighth for the Angels. He is 2 for 9 in the series.	Pinch-hitter Seth Brown delivered a go-ahead sacrifice fly in the sixth and Andrus followed with his double to make it 5-2.	Yusmeiro Petit gave up a leadoff homer to Jared Walsh in the ninth but finished for his second save.	Los Angeles lefty Andrew Heaney (4-4) had his three-start winning streak snapped, allowing three earned runs and five hits over five innings. He struck out six.	STICKY STUFF	Angels manager Joe Maddon supports the upcoming MLB crackdown that promises to penalize pitchers for using foreign substances to help them grip the ball.	“As an industry and moving forward and really trying to create the best version of our game that we can to make it interesting for us and for kids that may want to play in the future, I think it’s the right thing to do,” Maddon said. “It is really an unfair advantage. And that unfair advantage can also be defined in regards to games with greater resources possibly. I’m not talking about getting better sticky stuff, I’m talking about getting better players that then utilize enhancements like this that make them even better.”	Maddon insists he isn’t trying to offend anyone with the Angels or in baseball.	“I’m all about this game being resurrected and putting it back on the pedestal it deserves," he said. "It still is the best game, but it’s not recognized that way. It’s not spoken about as the national pastime anymore, and that bothers me. I think all these little bumps in the road, all these glitches, interfere with that.”	MELVIN'S CONTRACT	Bob Melvin, the winningest manager in Oakland history, is staying put through at least next season after the club exercised his contract option for 2022.	“Bob brings a real human touch in a world that’s very much driven by data,” said Billy Beane, the A’s executive vice president of baseball operations. “Bob’s just kept up and he’s stayed in step.”	Melvin has guided the A’s to an 809-715 record since taking over on June 9, 2011. He recently passed Tony La Russa for most victories by an Oakland manager and last weekend became the 35th person in major league history with 1,300 managerial wins.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Angels: 3B Anthony Rendon was held out, a day after straining his right triceps diving for Chad Pinder’s double in the fifth. Rendon is not expected to need a stint on the injured list. “Better than we thought or expected,” Maddon said. … LHP José Quintana, who threw a 25-pitch bullpen Monday, is likely to face hitters soon and perhaps in a simulated game once the team returns to Anaheim.	Athletics: Pinder doesn't have a concussion from being hit behind his left ear by an 82 mph splitter from Junior Guerra in the seventh inning Monday but “was a little groggy this morning.” He came to the ballpark and went through baseball activities and isn't expected to miss significant time. “I'm happy to say he's feeling better as the day goes along," Melvin said. ... CF Ramón Laureano (strained right hip) ran the bases and “felt good and that's the most important thing,” Melvin said. If Laureano is fine Wednesday he will likely be activated.	ROSTER MOVE	The Angels optioned RHP James Hoyt to Triple-A Salt Lake and recalled RHP Aaron Slegers from their top farm club. Slegers entered in the eighth.	UP NEXT	LHP Cole Irvin (4-7, 3.70 ERA) takes the mound for Oakland in the series finale opposite RHP Griffin Canning (5-4, 5.22).	------	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

SAN FRANCISCO -- — Ahead the whole way, the Arizona Diamondbacks watched in almost disbelief when Mike Yastrzemski connected.	And just like that, the Diamondbacks had inched even closer to a most dubious mark.	The Diamondbacks blew a seven-run lead and lost their 21st straight road game, one short of the major league record, when Yastrzemski hit a grand slam with two outs in the eighth inning that lifted the San Francisco Giants to a 9-8 victory Tuesday night.	Arizona led 7-0 in the second inning, but couldn’t hold on and lost its 12th in a row overall.	“Anytime you lose it hurts, but for it to be in that kind of fashion, a grand slam in the bottom of the eighth, that one was tough,” Diamondbacks second baseman Josh Rojas said.	“It’d be a different story if we didn’t play a good game and came out of the blocks slow and they beat us down. It wasn’t just a home run. It was three inches from being foul. Down the line, hugged the pole, on a good pitch."	Said Rojas: “That one stung. That one stung a lot.”	The Diamondbacks can match the record of 22 consecutive road defeats shared by the 1963 New York Mets and the 1943 Philadelphia Athletics when they play the Giants at Oracle Park on Wednesday night. Arizona hasn’t won on the road since April 25 at Atlanta.	“It wears you down,” manager Torey Lovullo said. “At some point we’re going to understand why we’re walking through this. I don’t want things to creep into the guys heads about feeling sorry for themselves. This is a big boy league. It’s a man’s game.”	The Giants trailed 8-5 when Belt doubled leading off the eighth against Humberto Castellanos (0-1). San Francisco loaded the bases with two outs and Yastrzemski launched a 1-2 pitch deep over the right field fence into McCovey Cove for his first career grand slam.	“Every single person in that dugout had the mindset that we were going to come back and win that game because that’s how we are,” Yastrzemski said. “I was just hoping it didn’t start hooking until after it got past the foul pole. Once it got past there it was pretty exciting.”	Steven Duggar also homered to help San Francisco to its seventh straight win over Arizona. Brandon Belt had three hits and scored three runs.	Jimmie Sherfy (1-0), the fifth of six pitchers used by Giants manager Gabe Kapler, retired three batters to win. Tyler Rogers pitched the ninth for his ninth save.	Christian Walker had two hits and three RBI for the Diamondbacks. David Peralta and Asdrúbal Cabrera drove in two runs apiece.	Giants starter Zack Little threw 17 pitches and allowed four hits and four runs without retiring a batter in his second start as an opener in the last seven days.	Arizona scored three times in the second and added a later run that helped it take an 8-3 lead into the bottom of the sixth.	“We were in a good spot all the way through this game until the last inning,” Lovullo said.	Diamondbacks starter Alex Young allowed five hits and three runs in four innings in his first start since Sept. 23, 2020.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Diamondbacks: RHP Taylor Clarke was placed on the injured list with a strained muscle in the upper body. RHP Seth Frankoff was transferred to the 60-day IL.	Giants: INF/OF Darin Ruf may have to stay on the injured list longer than expected after being unable to run the bases with the intensity that the Giants hoped he would Monday, although Kapler declined to call it a setback. Ruf has been out since May 27 with a strained right hamstring.	UP NEXT	RHP Anthony DeSclafani (6-2, 3.09 ERA) faces the Diamondbacks on Wednesday. DeSclafani pitched a two-hit shutout against the Nationals on June 11. Arizona RHP Merrill Kelly (2-6, 5.14) makes his sixth career start against the Giants. Kelly enters the game holding opponents to a .235 average over his last four starts on the road.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SEATTLE -- — J.P. Crawford homered on J.A. Happ's first pitch, Shed Long Jr. hit a three-run triple an inning later and the Seattle Mariners thumped the Minnesota Twins 10-0 on Tuesday night.	Seattle starter Chris Flexen tossed eight sharp innings while striking out a career-high eight, and was backed by an early offensive outburst that plated five runs in the first two innings.	“It was pretty awesome. I don’t think anything really felt different. It was just definitely locked in and had all four pitches going,” Flexen said.	Crawford became the first Mariners player to homer on the opening pitch since Dustin Ackley in 2012 when he drove Happ’s fastball out to right field for his fourth of the season.	Long, recently recalled from the minors after a lengthy recovery from a stress fracture in his shin sustained last season, provided the big blow in the second inning with a bases-loaded liner into the right-center gap and capped the triple with a belly-flop slide into third base.	Long said he continues to try and rediscover his form from 2019 when he hit .263 in 42 games.	“I always think about it, just trying to get back to that guy,” he said. “I definitely think that I’m getting close to that and, I’m just working on a daily basis to continue to get there and honestly just be better than that guy in 2019.”	Jake Fraley and Ty France added RBI singles, and Luis Torrens and France hit solo homers late in the game. France had not gone deep since April 18. Seattle set a season high for runs and matched its season best in hits with 14.	Flexen (6-3) had never pitched beyond the seventh, but scattered four hits and twice had baserunners quickly eliminated by double plays. No runner reached second base for the Twins as Flexen walked none, and only a pitch count of 107 kept him from attempting to finish a complete game.	It was the sixth time in 12 starts this season that Flexen has allowed one earned run or none.	“Absolutely the best starting pitching outing we’ve had all year,” Seattle manager Scott Servais said. “He just dominated the strike zone. I think it was first-pitch strikes about 80%, had all of his pitches working. It was really fun to watch when he’s got it going on like that with command of everything.”	Happ (3-3) lasted just four innings, the third time in his past seven starts the lefty failed to pitch into the fifth.	Aside from Crawford’s homer and Long’s triple, Happ wasn’t hit especially hard, but the quantity added up to trouble. His nine hits allowed matched a season high.	“I think he was at times getting a little frustrated with what was going on and maybe some of the pitches he was making, maybe the fact that the balls are finding grass behind him,” Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. “Really every adjustment he tried to make for one reason or another just didn’t seem to work out.”	FLEX ON THEM	Flexen mixed his pitches remarkably well, throwing 30 fastballs, 30 cutters, 30 changeups and 17 curveballs. He also got a pair of key double plays and leads the majors with 13 double plays induced this season.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Twins: OF Byron Buxton (hip strain) ramped up his activity a bit, going through a full pregame workout with a little additional running added on, Baldelli said. It’s still unclear if Buxton will be activated for the series finale Wednesday or if the Twins will wait until after Thursday’s off day and a weekend series at Texas.	Mariners: Seattle remains hopeful OF Mitch Haniger will be back in the lineup in the next few days after fouling a pitch off his knee last Sunday in Cleveland. Haniger went through some pregame baseball activities and Servais felt a stint on the injured list would not be needed for the starting right fielder.	UP NEXT	Twins: RHP Bailey Ober (0-0, 4.85 ERA) will make his fourth career start. Ober allowed two runs over five innings in his last start against Houston.	Mariners: LHP Justus Sheffield (5-5, 4.91) lasted just four innings in his last start against Detroit and has made it through six just once in his past six starts.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

LOS ANGELES -- — Thousands of Dodgers fans got their first opportunity to see Mookie Betts play at home in person Tuesday night as stadiums in California were allowed to go to full capacity as part of eased COVID-19 restrictions.	The star outfielder didn't disappoint them.	Betts hit a go-ahead home run in the seventh inning to lead Los Angeles to a 5-3 victory in front of a sellout crowd of 52,078 at Dodger Stadium. It was the largest attendance for a baseball game in the United States since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.	The Dodgers acquired Betts from the Boston Red Sox in February 2020, so this was the first time he got to play for Los Angeles before a big crowd at Chavez Ravine.	“At the beginning I soaked it in while I could. After that I tuned it out and took care of business. I'm used to playing in front of big crowds,” Betts said.	Betts led off the seventh by driving an 0-2 changeup from Ranger Suárez (2-1) over the left-center wall to give Los Angeles a 4-3 lead. Betts, who had three hits, also provided an insurance run with an RBI single in the eighth.	“For him to go deep and have a big night was great for the fans,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. “You could just feel the buzz and the anticipation. There were different moments where the crowd was on their feet.”	Betts had a .253 batting average going into June, the lowest of his career through two months, but has started to turn it around with three of his eight home runs coming in the last six games.	The Phillies have lost two straight, and slugger Bryce Harper left with lower back stiffness after he took an awkward swing in the fourth.	Second baseman Jean Segura, fifth in the majors with a .332 batting average, also exited with an apparent left groin injury after beating out a grounder with two outs in the ninth.	Philadelphia manager Joe Girardi said Harper is day to day but he's concerned Segura will be out longer.	Joe Kelly (2-0), the third of five Dodgers pitchers, worked a scoreless seventh to get the win and Blake Treinen pitched the ninth for his third save.	The Dodgers got on the board in the first when Gavin Lux reached with a one-out single, advanced to third on Justin Turner's single and scored on Will Smith's grounder.	Philadelphia quickly evened it in the second when Andrew McCutchen drove Julio Urías' fastball into the seats in left-center.	The Dodgers took a 3-1 lead in the fourth on RBI doubles by Zach McKinstry and Urías. The Dodgers lead the NL in RBI by their pitchers with 15, including eight by Urías in his last five starts.	Philadelphia evened it in the fifth by taking advantage of a pair of Dodgers errors. After Alec Bohm led off with a single, Luke Williams reached first on a throwing error by second baseman Chris Taylor. After pitcher Zach Eflin's sacrifice bunt moved the runners to second and third, Odúbel Herrera's base hit drove in Bohm. Williams scored to tie it at 3 when left fielder Matt Beaty misplayed the ball.	The Phillies had their chance in the eighth after Phil Bickford walked the first two batters. But he rebounded with strikeouts of McCutchen and Bohm before Williams grounded out to end the threat.	Philadelphia left nine on base and was 1 for 9 with runners in scoring position.	“Hitting it with runners in scoring position usually is the difference in the games,” Girardi said.	FOR STARTERS	Urías was trying to become the first 10-game winner in the majors but was plagued by bad fielding. The left-hander allowed six hits and three runs (two earned) in 5 2/3 innings with five strikeouts and two walks. It was only the third no-decision for Urías in 15 starts.	Eflin failed to make it to the sixth inning for only the second time in 13 starts. He went five, allowing three runs and seven hits with two strikeouts.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: SS Didi Gregorius' rehab stint at Triple-A Lehigh Valley is on pause after it was determined he has pseudogout in his right elbow. General manager Sam Fuld said on the Phillies Radio Network pregame show that the team hopes Gregorius can resume playing before the end of the week.	Dodgers: 1B Yoshi Tsutsugo (calf) has reported to Triple-A Oklahoma City, but Roberts said Tsutsugo has not played yet because his luggage hasn't arrived.	UP NEXT	The Dodgers conclude a six-game homestand with LHP Clayton Kershaw (8-5, 3.39 ERA) taking the hill. The Phillies are the only NL team that has a winning record against Kershaw at 5-4. Philadelphia RHP Zack Wheeler (4-3, 2.29) is ninth in the NL in ERA but is 0-1 in his last three starts.	------	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

ST. LOUIS -- — Yadier Molina grounded an RBI single down the third base line in the ninth inning and the St. Louis Cardinals edged the Miami Marlins 1-0 Wednesday to sweep the season series.	Molina’s eighth career regular season walk-off hit came with one out and sent Miami to its fourth straight loss.	“I’m ready for any spot but, I mean, you got to turn (up) your level in those kinds of spots, your concentration has to be there,” Molina said.	Paul Goldschmidt reached on an error by shortstop Jazz Chisholm Jr. to start the ninth. After Matt Carpenter walked with one out, Molina singled off Marlins starter Sandy Alcantara (4-6).	“I’m throwing my best pitch, trying to get a ground ball to make a quick double play over there, but he made an adjustment,” Alcantara said.	The Cardinals went 6-0 against Miami this year for their first season sweep over the Marlins. St. Louis won all three games at Busch Stadium in its final at-bat — Goldschmidt’s solo homer in the ninth produced a 2-1 win Tuesday night.	“Stay together, stay with it, keep fighting, but also just lock in what you’re doing,” Cardinals manager Mike Shildt said. “Just have a good at bat. Make a quality pitch, make a good play. Stay present. Be aware of the situation. Just keep playing the game that’s in front of you at that moment.”	Ryan Helsley (4-4) and Andrew Miller combined for two scoreless innings of relief.	Cardinals starter Johan Oviedo is still seeking his first major league win despite pitching a career-high seven scoreless innings. The right-hander allowed six hits, struck out four, walked none and 63 of his 87 pitches were strikes.	“Just keep my mind on one pitch, that’s the key for me,” Oviedo said.	Alcantara pitched a team season-high 8 1/3 innings. He gave up six hits, struck out seven with one walk, and the one run he allowed was unearned.	Oviedo retired the first 10 batters he faced before giving up back-to-back singles to Jon Berti and Jesús Sánchez in the fourth. Goldschmidt made a strong throw home to Molina on a grounder by Jorge Alfaro to get Berti at the plate.	“Oviedo was really good today,” Molina said. “Every start he’s getting better and better. He’s gained more confidence, is attacking the zone more, the off-speed pitches – the curveball and the sliders – were very sharp.”	A throwing error and a botched fielder’s choice by the Marlins defense put Alcantara into a jam in the fourth, but he got out of it by getting Edmundo Sosa to hit into a double play.	Alcantara finished at 108 pitches, 76 for strikes.	Marlins manager Don Mattingly didn’t hesitate to send Alcantara back out for the ninth inning.	“I think he’d earned it all day, right,” Mattingly said. “Kept his pitch count down, he stayed on the attack. Yeah, we really felt like his pitch count was at a point that we knew we would have to watch it if it got too big there in the ninth, but you didn’t really feel like you had somebody better out there that was going to be better than Sandy.”	STILL STREAKING	Tyler O’Neill extended his on-base streak to a career-best 22 games with an infield hit in the Cardinals fourth.	TRAINING ROOM	Marlins: RHP Luis Madero was designated for assignment and INF Deven Marrero was selected from Triple-A Jacksonville.	Cardinals: INF Tommy Edman (right side tightness) missed his second straight game and is day-to-day. ... Sosa left the game after getting hit in the right hand in the seventh. X-rays were negative and he is day-to-day.	UP NEXT	Marlins: Continue their six-game road trip for the first of three against the Chicago Cubs on Friday night. Neither team has announced a starting pitcher.	Cardinals: RHP John Gant (4-4, 3.86 ERA) begins a six-game road trip on Thursday night with the first of four against the Atlanta Braves, who have not announced a starter. Gant struggled in his last start, giving up a career high seven runs in four innings in a no-decision against the Cincinnati Reds on June 6.	----	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

MILWAUKEE -- — Tyler Mahle tied his career high with 12 strikeouts, Tucker Barnhart drove in the go-ahead run with a double in the seventh inning, and the Cincinnati Reds beat the Milwaukee Brewers 2-1 on Wednesday to finish a three-game sweep.	Cincinnati has won six straight and 11 of 13. The Brewers dropped three straight for the first time in nearly a month and were swept for the third time this season. Milwaukee totaled nine hits and four runs in the series against the Reds.	“They pitched well,” Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. “Tyler Mahle is having a really good year and I thought he pitched really well today. His fastball was really good, really well-located, consistently threw it up and never made mistakes down in the zone.”	Mahle (7-2) allowed three hits and a pair of walks over six innings as he surpassed the 10-strikeout mark for the first time this season and fifth of his career. Brad Brach, Sean Doolittle and Lucas Sims completed the five-hitter, with Sims getting the last four outs for his seventh save.	“It's been the whole team,” Mahle said. “The starters have been doing great, the bullpen has been doing great and the offense has been doing a great job all season.”	The Brewers scored their lone run in the third when Chirstian Yelich drove in Daniel Vogelbach with a single to right.	Milwaukee's Freddy Peralta (6-2) struck out six over six innings without walking a batter. He gave up five hits, the first a two-out single by Nick Castellanos in the fourth. Tyler Naquin followed with a double to left, scoring Castellanos.	Peralta retired his first two batters in the seventh before Joey Votto reached on a single. Votto scored the go-ahead run on Barnhart’s 14th double of the season.	“It was fun,” Barnhart said “What a fun game to be a part of. I'm proud of everybody, all series long.”	The Reds were hardly overwhelming at the plate. After winning 2-1 on Tuesday night with just two hits, they totaled six hits on Wednesday.	HE CALLED IT	Barnhart told Votto before the start of the seventh to be ready to score if he was on base when Barnhart came up.	“The second I got to first base, I knew I had to be ready to score because my man called it,” Votto said. "That was a big hit in a big spot and I had to score.”	The veteran first baseman emphatically pumped his fist before making his way back to the dugout, where his teammates were just as fired up after seeing him score from first.	“Joey is the heartbeat of this team,” Barnhart said. “Seeing him fired up like that is awesome.”	BREWERS ADD AN ARM	Milwaukee claimed right-handed reliever Ryan Weber off waivers from the Red Sox on Wednesday and optioned him to Triple-A Nashville.	Weber, 30, allowed 11 runs including four homers in his lone appearance this season for the Red Sox and had a 4.63 ERA in seven appearances (six starts) for Triple-A Worcester. He was designated for assignment two days ago when Boston acquired Yacksel Rios in a trade with Seattle.	To make room for Weber on the 40-man roster, Milwaukee outrighted RHP Chad Sobotka to Triple-A Nashville.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Reds: INF Mike Moustakas was expected to return from the injured list during the team’s trip to San Diego this weekend but instead returned to Cincinnati after experiencing soreness in his foot during a rehab appearance with Triple-A Louisville Tuesday night.	Brewers: LHP Angel Perdomo is scheduled to join Triple-A Nashville to begin a rehab assignment this weekend. Perdomo has been out since straining his lower back on May 30.	UP NEXT	The Reds travel to San Diego for a four-game series against the Padres, with Wade Miley (6-4, 2.92 ERA) starting Thursday night's opener against Joe Musgrove (4-6, 2.50).	Milwaukee's Brandon Woodruff (5-2, 1.52) starts the opener of a four-game series at Colorado. German Marquez (4-6, 4.60) takes the mound for the Rockies on Thursday night.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- — Willi Castro homered during a three-run rally in the seventh inning and the Detroit Tigers beat the Kansas City Royals 6-5 Wednesday for a three-game sweep.	It was the Tigers’ first sweep in Kansas City since 2014.	The Royals have lost six in a row and 11 of 12. Kansas City starter Brady Singer was removed after just three innings with tightness in his pitching shoulder.	“It popped up after his last start,” Royals manager Mike Matheny said. “We knew going into today that we were going to see how he was feeling and try to limit the work. We’ll see how he responds from here, but we were just being cautious.”	Tarik Skubal (4-7) picked up the win. He allowed three runs on six hits in six innings, striking out seven against an all-righthanded lineup.	“The whole point as a starting pitcher is to give yourself a chance to continue the game,” Detroit manager A.J. Hinch said. “He’s progressively gotten better at not having the big, explosive innings. He allowed us to slowly and surely get to their bullpen and come from behind and win.”	Skubal had a plan going in, and he stuck with it.	“I threw a lot more changeups than I did sliders,” Skubal said. “I knew the changeup would be a huge pitch for me against this lineup, just being able to work down and expand the zone.”	Michael Fulmer earned his fifth save in six chances.	Adalberto Mondesi hit a home run in his first at-bat since returning from the injured list. Salvador Perez also connected for the Royals, hitting his 17th of the season.	“(Mondesi) is unbelievable,” Matheny said. “The first time he steps in the box, he blasts it.”	Greg Holland (2-2) gave up three runs while getting just one out.	Holland issued a four-pitch walk to the first batter he faced, Niko Goodrum, in the seventh and Castro homered to make it 3-all.	“The hitting coach said after he gets two strikes he likes to throw the breaking pitch,” Castro said. “I was just trying to battle and let my abilities do the work.”	Holland left after a one-out single by Robbie Grossman, and reliever Scott Barlow gave up a single to Akil Baddoo and threw a wild pitch that let the go-ahead run score.	The Tigers’ fifth run also scored on a wild pitch in the eighth and Detroit added a run in the ninth for a 6-3 lead.	Whit Merrifield hit an RBI double with two outs in the Royals ninth and Carlos Santana followed with a run-scoring single. Perez struck out to end the game.	Singer, who allowed one run on four hits, became the first Royals pitcher in five games not to surrender a run in the first inning when he worked around a one-out walk.	Mondesi hit a 445-foot homer in the second, giving the Royals their first lead in 46 innings.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Royals: SS Mondesi was activated from the 10-day IL on Tuesday, but he didn’t appear in the game. He was in the starting lineup Wednesday, batting fifth. Mondesi has been out since May 31 with a left hamstring strain. Matheny said the plan was to activate Mondesi for Wednesday’s game, but RHP Ronald Bolanos was placed on the IL opening a spot a day earlier. Mondesi was in the on-deck circle as a pinch-hitter when the final out was made.	UP NEXT	Tigers: Open a four-game series against the Los Angeles Angels in Anaheim. RHP Matt Manning will make his major league debut. Manning was 1/3 with an 8.07 ERA in seven starts with Triple-A Toledo. The Tigers have not won a season series with the Angels since 2010.	Royals: After an off-day Thursday, Kansas City will continue the homestand with the first of three games against the Boston Red Sox on Friday night. RHP Jackson Kowar (0-2, 36.00 ERA) will try to find the form that made him one of the Royals’ top prospects. Kowar has not lasted more than 1 1/3 innings in either of his starts, and he’s allowed four earned runs in each.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO -- — Yasmani Grandal hit a game-ending RBI single in the 10th inning and the Chicago White Sox beat Tampa Bay 8-7 on Wednesday, taking two of three from the Rays in a matchup of division leaders.	Jóse Abreu hit his 12th homer of the season for the White Sox, who’ve won 10 of 13.	Yandy Díaz and Mike Zunino homered for the Rays, who won Monday night’s opener but dropped the next two.	Abreu moved automatic runner Andrew Vaughn to third with a groundout and Grandal brought him home with a sharp liner to the right field wall off Pete Fairbanks (1-1).	“It’s huge,” said Grandal, who struck out with runners on in the fifth and seventh innings. “I left some guys in scoring position today, so the fact I was able to come through to walk it off was huge.”	Ryan Burr (1-0) worked a scoreless 10th for Chicago.	Lucas Giolito retired the first 10 Rays, mostly with easy flyouts and popups, before Randy Arozarena doubled in the fourth.	The White Sox gave Giolito a 4-0 lead in the bottom of the inning. Abreu sent Yarbrough’s 1-2 delivery into the left field stands to score Vaughn, and Zack Collins added a two-run single.	Yarbrough gave up three more runs in the fifth. Tim Anderson scored from second when third baseman Díaz threw wide of first after fielding Brian Goodwin’s sacrifice bunt. Yarbrough was charged with seven runs, five earned, on 10 hits and a walk in 6 1/3 innings.	“It seemed like every time they put a ball in play, they were landing where we were not,” Rays manager Kevin Cash said. “I’m encouraged and, overall, impressed with the way the guys were able to get back into the game and ultimately tie it.”	Kevin Kiermaier doubled in two runs in the top of the fifth for the Rays, who got a solo shot from Díaz an inning later. Giolito left after six, giving up three earned runs on four hits while striking out seven and walking two.	“We’re feeding off each other. We’re picking each other up when we need to and that’s a winning formula,” said Giolito, who got a no-decision in his 100th career appearance. “It’s a long season. Not everybody’s going to have their best stuff every day.”	Zunino added a two-run knock off reliever Codi Heuer in the seventh and Tampa Bay tied it in the eighth when Mike Brosseau came home on a fielder’s choice and Manuel Margot doubled to score pinch-runner Brett Phillips. Both unearned runs were charged to Aaron Bummer.	GET A GRIP!	Ji-Man Choi struck out swinging in the fourth but his bat almost made it out of the infield. The Rays first baseman lost hold of his stick on his follow-through and it flew just to the edge of the infield grass between first and second. No Chicago players were near the bat while it was in flight.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Rays: RHP Collin McHugh was placed on the COVID-19-related injury list before the game after waking up feeling ill. Cash said after the game that McHugh tested negative for the coronavirus. Right-hander Chris Mazza was recalled from Triple-A Durham to fill the roster spot. ... RHP Michael Wacha will likely start in place of injured Tyler Glasnow on Friday at Seattle after Cash didn’t use him out of the bullpen Wednesday.	White Sox: Leury García was at third base Wednesday as Yoán Moncada missed a third straight game with a sinus infection. Manager Tony La Russa said he believed Moncada will return to the lineup Thursday at Houston. ... RHP Michael Kopech (strained left hamstring) threw off a mound Tuesday but there’s still no schedule for his return to the bullpen. He’s been on the 10-day injured list since May 31.	UP NEXT	Rays: LHP Rich Hill (5-2, 3.38 ERA) faces RHP Justin Dunn (1-3, 3.91) in Thursday’s series opener at Seattle.	White Sox: Dylan Cease (5-2, 3.38) faces fellow right-hander Jóse Urquidy (4-3, 3.77) on Thursday night when Chicago opens a four-game series at Houston.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DENVER -- — Pinch-hitter Charlie Blackmon singled home the winning run in the ninth inning and the Colorado Rockies shook off a monster homer by Fernando Tatis Jr. to beat the stumbling San Diego Padres 8-7 on Wednesday.	Tatis hit a 477-foot homer, the longest of his career and his NL-leading 21st. He also doubled, but the Padres lost for the 13th time in 17 games.	“Just terrible. There’s no sugar-coating it,” San Diego manager Jayce Tingler said of the just completed 1-5 road trip.	The Padres are home for the next 10 games, starting with four against the surging Cincinnati Reds.	“I promise you we’re going to be OK,” outfielder Jurickson Profar said. “We’re too talented for things to keep going this way.”	The gametime temperature was 99 degrees at Coors Field, and the hot weather contributed to a big offensive day. The teams combined for five home runs and 24 hits and neither starter made it out of the fourth inning.	After an error in the ninth inning helped the Padres score a run that made it 7-all, the Rockies won it. Trevor Story drew a leadoff walk from Austin Adams (2-1), stole second and scored when Blackmon hit a 1-2 pitch into center field.	Story doubled twice, stole two bases and scored three times.	“You’ve seen that out of our group that resiliency out of our group has shown up,” manager Bud Black said. “The guys know a ballgame is never over, they play all 54 outs and if we have to go 10 (innings) we’ll go 10.”	Raimel Tapia had three hits to extend his hitting streak to 13 games, the longest of his career, and C.J. Cron homered for the second time in the series for the Rockies.	Colorado improved to 23-14 at Coors Field, which is in stark contrast to its 5-27 record on the road.	“Our confidence is really high at home,” Story said. “We’re playing really well at home right now and obviously the challenge is to recreate that on the road.”	The Rockies led 7-6 in the ninth, but Carlos Estévez (2-0) walked the first two batters in the ninth and second baseman Brendan Rodgers’ throwing error allowed the Padres to tie it on a sacrifice fly.	Colorado starter Kyle Freeland gave up two homers in 3 2/3 innings and has allowed nine longballs in his last three starts.	Tatis hit a solo drive and Trent Grisham had a two-run homer in the third to make it 3-all. he Padres went ahead 5-4 in the fourth on consecutive doubles from Tatis and Manny Machado.	Elías Díaz had three hits, including a home run off San Diego starter Blake Snell.	Pinch-hitter Jake Cronenworth homered for the Padres.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Rockies: RHP Jon Gray (right flexor tendon) will throw a bullpen session on Thursday instead of a simulated game. Black said if all goes well Gray could head out for a rehab start with Triple-A Albuquerque.	MILD MILESTONE	Story’s run-scoring double in the first inning was the 400th RBI of his career, the 13th Colorado player to reach that number. He is 1,005 RBI behind all-time Rockies leader Todd Helton.	“It was a cool accomplishment but on to the next,” Story said.	MERCURY RISING	The 99 degrees at first pitch is the second-highest temperature in Coors Field history. The hottest came June 25, 2012, when it was 100 degrees. Monday and Tuesday the gametime temperatures were 98 degrees.	REMEMBERING GWYNN	Wednesday marked seven years since San Diego great and Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn passed away at age 54 from salivary gland cancer. Gwynn played 20 years in the majors, all with the Padres, and finished his career with 3,141 hits and a .338 batting average.	ROSTER MOVE	The Padres optioned LHP Ryan Weathers to Triple-A El Paso and recalled RHP James Norwood. Norwood made his San Diego debut by getting the final two outs of the fourth inning.	“It’s best for him to stay in turn, get his starts and get his bullpen in between starts and continue to build,” Tingler said of Weathers.	UP NEXT	Padres: RHP Joe Musgrove (4-6, 2.50 ERA) will open a four-game home series against Cincinnati on Thursday night.	Rockies: RHP Germán Márquez (4-6, 4.60) makes his sixth career start against Milwaukee on Thursday night in the opener of a four-game home series.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- — Ramón Laureano hit a home run and made a homer-robbing catch in his return from the injured list, and the Oakland Athletics rallied past the Los Angeles Angels 8-4 Wednesday for their sixth straight win.	Shohei Ohtani homered for the second straight day, giving him 19 for the Angels. He also neatly bunted against the shift for a single and stole his team-leading 10th base, a day before he was scheduled to start on the mound.	Laureano, who missed 17 games with a strained right hip, perfectly timed his jump to reach over the fence and catch Justin Upton's flyball in the fourth. The acrobatic center fielder was credited with the fifth homer-saving grab in his career.	In the bottom of the fourth, Laureano connected for his 12th homer, cutting the Angels' lead to 4-1.	“I just wanted to play,” Laureano said. "At the end of the day, with the adrenaline the fans bring, I don’t really think about (the injury) when I’m out there. Just kind of compete, get a good at-bat, good, quality pitch and just go after it. It was a good game overall.”	Added A's manager Bob Melvin: “We get spoiled with his play. We see it all the time, but it’s really good.”	Angels starter Griffin Canning limited the A’s to two earned runs on three hits and two walks in five innings. But Oakland teed off on lefty reliever Tony Watson during a six-run sixth.	Watson (2-3) faced six batters and didn’t record an out, surrendering six earned runs on five hits and a walk.	“His changeup was cutting,” Angels manager Joe Maddon explained. “It was not doing it’s normal thing. I didn’t know that immediately, but I was told that afterward. So that pitch that he normally relies on wasn’t reacting like it normally does. I think that was a big part of it.”	Matt Olson singled twice in the big inning, finishing 3 for 4 with an RBI. Mark Canha, Matt Chapman, Chad Pinder and Tony Kemp also drove in runs in the inning.	The Angels jumped on Athletics starter Cole Irvin for three runs on five hits in the first inning. But Irvin settled in to pitch 5 2/3 innings for a no-decision.	“Today was one of those days where I didn’t have everything,” Irvin said. “I had to battle.”	Burch Smith (1-0) went 1 1/3 scoreless innings for the win.	The AL West-leading A’s improved to 43-27, their best record through 70 games since 1990, when they were 45-25.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Angels: 3B Anthony Rendon missed his second straight game with a strained right triceps but is expected to return as soon as Thursday.	Athletics: Pinder returned after being hit behind his left ear by an 82 mph splitter from Junior Guerra on Monday. He entered the game as a pinch-hitter in the sixth inning and went 2 for 2 with an RBI.	ROSTER MOVE	The Athletics reinstated Laureano from the 10-day injured list before the game and optioned OF Skye Bolt to Triple-A Las Vegas. Bolt went 1 for 13 with a home run in nine games with Oakland.	UP NEXT	Angels: Ohtani (2-1, 2.85 ERA) takes the hill Thursday as Los Angeles welcomes the Detroit Tigers for a four-game series.	Athletics: RHP James Kaprielian (3-1, 2.51) makes his seventh career start Friday as Oakland opens a three-game series at Yankee Stadium.	—-	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

WASHINGTON -- — Paolo Espino got his first major league win at age 34, Josh Bell hit a two-run homer against his former team and the Washington Nationals beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 3-1 on Wednesday for a three-game sweep.	Espino (1-2) allowed three hits in five scoreless innings. He struck out two, walked none and threw 39 of his 53 pitches for strikes, a 74% strike rate.	“I didn’t know how far they were going to let me go, so I was just focusing on being efficient,” Espino said.	Washington has won four straight, matching its longest winning streak of the season. The Pirates extended their skid to 10 games.	Max Scherzer (groin) was placed on the 10-day injured list Tuesday. The Nationals debated who to use in his rotation spot before settling on Espino, who was drafted in 2006 and made his fifth career big league start. Manager Dave Martinez had Espino speak to the team afterward.	“That’s awesome,” Martinez said of Espino's first win. “Really is.”	Brad Hand got the final five outs, allowing consecutive two-out singles in the ninth before retiring the side for his 13th save.	Yan Gomes hit his seventh homer of the season in the second inning off Chase De Jong (0-1). Bell hit a 1-0 fastball into the right-center field stands, his ninth homer of the year, to give the Nationals a 3-0 lead in the seventh.	Bryan Reynolds singled home Ke’Bryan Hayes in the eighth for the Pirates' only run.	“We’ve just got to keep going,” Pittsburgh manager Derek Shelton said. “There’s no magic elixir. If there was, we would have used it already.”	The Nationals loaded the bases with one out in the fourth and sixth innings but did not score. Jordy Mercer struck out and Victor Robles flied out in the fourth. Ryan Zimmerman's flyout to deep center on a 2-0 pitch from Chris Stratton ended the later threat.	The Nationals came into the day ranked 28th in the majors in on base-plus-slugging percentage with the bases loaded.	ROSTER MOVE	The Nationals placed third baseman Starlin Castro on the restricted list Wednesday and called up second baseman Luis García.	Castro has “family matters” to attend to, Martinez said. The veteran left the team Tuesday night. There is no timetable for his return.	“He needs to take care of the issues that he has,” Martinez said. “When he comes back, we’ll welcome him with open arms.”	Martinez will use matchups to determine his starting infield. The left-handed García will play second against righties. Veteran Jordy Mercer will get regular starts at third, and Josh Harrison will platoon with García and start taking more groundballs at third.	Castro's .599 OPS is near the bottom of the league among regular third baseman.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Nationals: RHP Stephen Strasburg (neck) threw lightly in the outfield Wednesday. There is no timetable for his return, but Martinez said the throwing session was a good first step for one of the Nationals’ most important players. Strasburg has made just five starts this season. He was placed on the 10-day injured list on June 2.	UP NEXT	The Nationals are off Thursday before opening a four-game home series against the NL East-leading New York Mets. Erick Fedde (4-4, 3.86 ERA) will start Friday's opener. Pittsburgh begins a three-game home series with Cleveland on Friday. Chad Kuhl (0-4, 6.52) is scheduled to start.	------	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

ATLANTA -- — Christian Arroyo relished delivering the big hit Wednesday night. After reviewing the tape, he thinks his celebration needs some work.	Arroyo slugged a pinch-hit grand slam in the seventh inning to give Boston the lead and the surging Red Sox beat the Atlanta Braves 10-8 on Wednesday night to move within one game of first place.	Arroyo blew kisses and took a fancy step as he rounded third base.	“These are the type moments you live for,” he said. “I will say this, it does need some work. I saw the video of it.”	Boston recovered after blowing a 6-3 lead. Freddie Freeman hit a go-ahead homer for Atlanta  in the sixth after Dansby Swanson's three-run shot tied the game in the fifth.	The Red Sox (42-27) are only one game behind AL East-leading Tampa Bay, which lost 8-7 in 10 innings to the Chicago White Sox on Wednesday. Boston, which moved a season-best 15 games over .500, has won three consecutive games and five of seven.	Adam Ottavino gave up a run-scoring double to Ronald Acuña Jr. in the ninth. Acuña was thrown out at third and Ottavino struck out Freeman for his fourth save.	“Honestly I was just trying to make an aggressive play,” Acuña said through a translator. “Looking back on it now, that was my bad. I should have given the hitter behind me a chance to drive in a run.”	The Red Sox loaded the bases against Shane Greene (0-1) in the seventh. Greene struck out Bobby Dalbec for the second out of the inning before left-hander A.J. Minter gave up Arroyo's fourth homer deep into the left field seats.	Red Sox manager Alex Cora planned to use Danny Santana as his pinch-hitter before the Braves brought in Minter.	“When they went with the lefty it was a no-brainer, let’s go with Arroyo,” Cora said.	Yacksel Rios (1-0) recorded one out in the sixth after he was added to the roster before the game. Rios, 27, was acquired from Seattle on Monday for cash.	Hunter Renfroe hit a two-run single in the first and Xander Bogaerts had three doubles to lead Boston's 14-hit attack.	The Braves pulled even in the fifth on Swanson's three-run homer off Richards. With one out in the sixth, Freeman hit a low fastball from Hirokazu Sawamura into the seats in left-center for his 16th homer.	Boston swept the two-game series, extending the Braves' woes with consecutive 10-8 victories. Atlanta (30-35) has lost six of seven.	“We’ve got to do a better job of that if we’re going to get on a run like we feel like we’re capable of,” Braves manager Brian Snitker said.	Ian Anderson allowed four runs on seven hits and a walk in four innings. Boston scored two runs in the fourth off the right-hander. Dalbec's single drove in Renfroe, who just missed a homer with his double to left field.	Left-hander Darwinzon Hernandez survived a bases-loaded jam in the seventh. Ozzie Albies grounded out to end the inning.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Red Sox: C Christian Vazquez left the game in the seventh due to a stomach illness. ... Manager Alex Cora said LHP Chris Sale (Tommy John recovery) felt good Wednesday after Tuesday's bullpen session at Triple-A Worcester. Sale is scheduled to throw again on Friday. Sale had the surgery to replace the ulnar collateral ligament in his left elbow in March 2020 and Cora said the team won't rush his return. ... IF Michael Chavis was optioned to Triple-A Worcester.	Braves: LHP Tucker Davidson was placed on the 10-day injured list with left forearm inflammation. He left with one out in the third inning of Tuesday night's 10-8 loss to the Red Sox. “We've got to shut him down for 10 days just to let everything calm down,” said manager Brian Snitker. “Then we’ll see where we’re at.”	NEW RULE BLUES	Boston right-hander Garrett Richards allowed six runs, four earned, in four-plus innings. He said he is battling to adjust to Major League Baseball’s new enforcement of a ban on foreign substances used by pitchers. Beginning Monday, pitchers are subject to an ejection and a 10-game suspension if caught by umpires.	Richards said he was forced to rely almost completely on fastballs.	Asked if the adjustment is difficult, Richards said, “I can’t think of a worse time to be honest with you.”	The game lasted 4 hours, 10 minutes. Richards said that will become normal.	“If you just watch baseball across the league you’re going to see some interesting things,” he said. “Be prepared for four-hour games. ... I’m just grateful I got this far into my career before we’re at this point.”	ROCKY DEBUT	Braves left-hander Kyle Muller, recalled from Triple-A Gwinnett before the game, gave up two runs on four hits in the fifth in his major league debut. Bogaerts’ double drove in J.D. Martinez, who singled.	UP NEXT	Red Sox: Boston is off Thursday before opening a three-game series at Kansas City. The team has another off day on Monday but Cora plans no rotation changes. “We're going to maximize the rest,” he said.	Braves: RHP Charlie Morton (5-3, 4.50) is scheduled to face RHP John Gant (4-4, 3.36 ERA when Atlanta opens a four-game home series against St. Louis on Thursday night.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BUFFALO, N.Y. -- — Gerrit Cole pitched eight effective innings, pinch-hitter Gary Sánchez connected for a two-run homer and Aroldis Chapman dodged trouble in the ninth as the New York Yankees held off the Toronto Blue Jays 3-2 on Wednesday night.	Sánchez’s 10th homer of the season in the seventh gave the Yankees back-to-back wins behind key pinch hits, following Clint Frazier’s go-ahead double in the eighth inning of Tuesday’s 6-5 victory.	Chapman allowed hits to the first two batters in the ninth, putting runners at second and third, but escaped for his 14th save.	“They definitely made me work,” Chapman said through a translator. “To be able to come in and grind it out and get the victory, it was awesome.”	Cole (8-3) held the Blue Jays to four hits. He struck out four and walked one.	Marcus Semien and Cavan Biggio homered for Toronto, which has lost three straight and five of seven. Ross Stripling (2-4) limited New York to three hits and two walks over 6 1/3 innings and tied a season high with nine strikeouts.	In the ninth, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. led off with a single and Teoscar Hernández followed with a double to right field. After striking out Randal Grichuk, Chapman fielded a comebacker and started a play in which Sánchez threw out Guerrero, who was trying to retreat to third base. The call was upheld after a 70-second video review.	Chapman then got Lourdes Gurriel Jr. to fly out to end the game.	“For me, he’s the best closer in the game,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. “You have to keep making pitches, especially when you’re up against an offense that put together really good at-bats. When you’re the best at something you do, you’re out there with some confidence.”	Plate umpire CB Bucknor was hit in the mask by Chapman’s first pitch to Gurriel, a ball Bucknor ruled was fouled off by Gurriel. However, Bucknor didn’t immediately signal foul ball as he staggered from being struck, and Hernandez came almost all the way home before being stopped.	Replays showed Gurriel may not have made contact with the pitch. Toronto manager Charlie Montoyo argued for a review. The umpires convened, affirmed among themselves it was a foul ball, and informed Montoyo the play was not reviewable.	When asked if his heart raced during the ninth, Boone smiled and referred to the procedure he had in March: “I have a pacemaker, so it keeps it nice and steady.”	The ninth-inning drama overshadowed a fine pitching duel between Cole and Stripling.	After the Yankees scored a first-inning run, Stripling set down 18 of 20 batters and allowed no hits until Miguel Andújar singled leading off the seventh, the precursor to Sánchez's homer, which elicited chants of “Gary! Gary!” from a Yankees-centric crowd of 7,271 at Toronto’s temporary home in western New York.	Cole, meanwhile, retired 22 of his last 25 batters, with the only blemishes being a two-out walk in the second inning, Biggio's fifth-inning homer, and Hernández reaching on an error in the sixth.	"We don't need to be frustrated," Montoyo said. “Losing games like this is tough, but we're playing good."	Toronto reliever Rafael Doliz, who replaced Stripling, left the game with an apparent injury after issuing a four-pitch walk.	“He said he had no sensation in his hand, so we took him out,” Montoyo said. “He couldn't feel the ball.”	ADDING UP THE STRIKEOUTS	With his first-inning strikeout of Grichuk, Cole broke a tie for the most punchouts by a Yankees pitcher over the first 14 starts of a season. Cole entered the game tied with Masahiro Tanaka, who had 113 in 2014.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: RHP Corey Kluber (shoulder strain) is on a throwing program, playing catch from 60 feet. ... RHP Darren O'Day (strained rotator cuff) threw a bullpen and could begin a rehab assignment this weekend. ... Boone said 1B Luke Voit (strained oblique) is doing well in his rehab and could return within the next week.	Blue Jays: RHP Carl Edwards Jr., who left Tuesday's game after five pitches with a left oblique strain, was placed on the 10-day injured list. ... RHP Patrick Murphy (strained right A/C joint) was reinstated from the 60-day IL and pitched a perfect inning. ... LHP Travis Bergen (left shoulder impingement) was reinstated from the 10-day IL and optioned to Triple-A Buffalo.	UP NEXT	The series concludes Thursday night with New York RHP Michael King (0-3, 3.77 ERA) facing RHP T.J. Zeuch (0-2, 6.75), who will be promoted from Triple-A Buffalo for the start.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

CLEVELAND -- — Aaron Civale became the first pitcher with 10 wins this season and José Ramírez homered and drove in three runs as the Cleveland Indians beat the Orioles 8-7 Wednesday night, extending Baltimore’s road losing streak to 18 games.	César Hernández had a two-run triple and Ramírez had two hits and scored twice for the Indians, who moved a season-best nine games over .500. Cleveland seized control 6-3 in the third inning by scoring five runs off Keegan Akin (0-2).	The Orioles tied the eighth-longest road losing streak in major league history and are approaching the record of 22, shared by the 1943 Philadelphia Athletics and 1963 New York Mets and matched by Arizona on Wednesday night in a 13-7 loss to San Francisco.	“We had 12 hits and scored seven runs, but we just had one bad inning,” Baltimore manager Brandon Hyde said. “Sometimes, that’s the way it happens. We came back and answered, but not enough.”	Civale (10-2) allowed five runs in five innings, striking out two. Emmanuel Clase worked the ninth for his 11th save. Bryan Shaw, James Karinchak and Clase retired the final eight Baltimore batters.	“It was the bullpen and offense for us,” Civale said. “Baltimore made a lot of contact, so I tried to utilize my pitches the best I could. You’ve got to take those games when they happen. That’s when you get picked up by the guys and why it’s a team game.”	Ryan Mountcastle went 3 for 5 with a homer and four RBI, and Trey Mancini had three hits and scored three runs for Baltimore, which has the worst record in the AL at 22-45.	Mountcastle’s two-run homer to left pulled the Orioles within 6-5 in the fifth, but Hernández restored Cleveland’s three-run lead in the sixth by tripling home René Rivera and Bradley Zimmer with two outs.	Baltimore scored twice in the seventh off Shaw, cutting its deficit to 8-7 on back-to-back RBI singles by Austin Hays and Maikel Franco.	“I thought we had a pretty good chance to come back and win the game with the way we were swinging the bats,” Mountcastle said. “Unfortunately, it just wasn’t enough.”	Akin gave up a career-high eight runs and struck out seven in 5 2/3 innings, his longest outing in the majors. The left-hander permitted the first six hitters to reach base in the third inning.	Ramírez provided the go-ahead hit, singling home Hernández and Amed Rosario before winding up on third base after escaping a rundown between first and second on the same play.	Miscommunication between second baseman Pat Valaika, shortstop Freddy Galvis and third baseman Maikel Franco resulted in Ramírez reaching second, then sprinting to third when no one covered the bag.	“We didn’t do many things right on that,” Hyde said. “It just got botched. You’ve got to follow and you can’t be standing around. Someone has to get to the base.”	Baltimore opened the game with four straight hits off Civale, including RBI singles by Galvis and Mountcastle to take a 2-0 lead. Ramírez hit his 15th homer of the season in the first for the Indians.	Cleveland’s Eddie Rosario singled in the second on a pitch that he didn’t swing at. An inside fastball from Akin struck his bat handle and dribbled toward third base, giving Rosario time to reach first after initially not running.	“A lot of our guys are having a good time right now,” Rosario said.	HYDE AND SEEK	Orioles general manager Mike Elias declined to comment on the contract status of Hyde, but said his performance will not be judged by wins and losses. “I hired Brandon -- hand-picked him for this job -- and he is a partner with us in this multi-year process,” Elias said. Hyde is 101-188 in three seasons with Baltimore. “We knew this was going to take some time, and it’s going to take some time,” Hyde said.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Orioles: 1B Chris Davis (left hip labrum surgery) has shifted his injury rehabilitation to Baltimore and should be cleared for baseball activities by early September, according to Elias. Davis has been ruled out for the season.	Indians: DH Franmil Reyes (left oblique strain), who has been on the injured list since May 23, is making progress. Reyes will take batting practice at Single-A Lake County later this week and be re-evaluated Saturday.	UP NEXT	Orioles: RHP Jorge López (2-7, 5.64 ERA) takes on Cleveland for the second time this season. He pitched five innings, allowing three runs, in an 18-5 home victory on June 6.	Indians: RHP Eli Morgan (0-1, 20.25 ERA) will make his second big league appearance and start the series finale. Morgan was recalled from Triple-A Columbus on Tuesday.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

NEW YORK -- — A historic season is turning into a frustrating one for Jacob deGrom.	The New York Mets ace was pulled from a second straight start with an arm injury, this time leaving after three perfect innings with right shoulder soreness, but the bullpen stepped up to finish a three-hitter in a 6-3 win over the Chicago Cubs on Wednesday night.	One start after being pulled from a gem against San Diego with flexor tendinitis in his right arm, deGrom went directly down the clubhouse tunnel after finishing the third against the Cubs.	“Felt good warming up, felt really good in the first and second inning, then there in the third my shoulder was sore,” deGrom said. “This is getting old. I want to be out there competing.”	DeGrom said initial tests ruled out a serious issue, but he planned to get imaging and more observation Thursday. He and manager Luis Rojas both said it was too early to know if he'd go on the injured list.	“I expect to go out there and give us depth and I haven’t done that like I expect out of myself,” deGrom said. “The bullpen’s done a great job of picking me up. But I can’t keep doing that to those guys.”	DeGrom appeared to grimace after a third-inning pitch to Eric Sogard. He threw 51 pitches, the last a 99 mph fastball to strike out pitcher Robert Stock, his seventh straight strikeout victim and eighth punch-out out of nine hitters.	He’s the first pitcher since at least 1901 with at least eight strikeouts over three perfect innings to start a game, according to STATS.	“First couple of pitches, I was like, ‘OK, maybe it’ll go away,'” deGrom said. “And it continued on every pitch throughout the inning. And that’s when I was like ‘OK maybe we’ve got to be smart.’	“Again, I keep saying it’s early, but this is frustrating coming out of games like that.”	DeGrom pitched one-hit ball over six scoreless innings against the Padres on Friday night before leaving with the flexor issue. He had an MRI the next day that revealed no damage, and he resumed his usual between-start routine. He started Wednesday on his standard four days of rest.	He also had a start pushed back in early May due to a sore right side and then exited a start against Arizona on May 9 when he aggravated the injury. He was placed on the injured list two days later.	DeGrom returned May 25 and gave up a second-inning homer to the Colorado Rockies’ Ryan McMahon. That’s the most recent run allowed by deGrom, whose 25 consecutive scoreless innings have shrunk his ERA to 0.54, the lowest mark ever by a pitcher through his first 11 starts.	DeGrom also had an RBI single in the second on Wednesday, raising his average to .423. He has six RBI compared to four earned runs allowed this year, and he could be among the frontrunners for NL MVP if he stays healthy.	“What he’s doing is just amazing and to be on the other side of it obviously is no fun, but you’ve got to appreciate what he’s doing as a competitor — he just mowed us down,” Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo said. “I hope he’s all right. Even his at-bat — that’s the craziest stat of all.”	Sean Reid-Foley (2-0) relieved deGrom and earned the win after allowing one run over two innings. Rizzo ended the bid for a combined perfect game or no-hitter by homering with one out in the fourth.	Kevin Pillar opened the scoring with an RBI double off Stock (0-1) in the second and homered in the fifth. Dominic Smith hit a one-out solo homer in the third and added a run-scoring grounder in the fourth immediately after Francisco Lindor drew a bases-loaded walk.	The Cubs stranded two runners each in the fourth and sixth against Reid-Foley and Aaron Loup before collecting two hits, including Rafael Ortega’s two-run homer, off Drew Smith in the ninth. Edwin Díaz entered and retired pinch-hitter Willson Contreras on a flyout to center for his 14th save.	Stock, who was recalled from Triple-A Iowa prior to the game, allowed five runs, four hits and six walks while striking out three in his first big league start.	VILLAR’S VARIED EVENING	Jonathan Villar had an eventful evening for the Mets. In the first inning, Villar stole second but was hit on the left ear by a throw from Cubs catcher Jose Lobaton. Villar remained on the ground for a few minutes but stayed in the game.	In the sixth, Villar was charged with throwing errors on back-to-back grounders by Javier Baez and Ian Happ. Villar backhanded both in-between hops but bounced the throws to first baseman Pete Alonso.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Cubs: IF/OF Kris Bryant (right hand), who exited Tuesday’s game one inning after he was hit by Taijuan Walker’s pitch, did not play. Manager David Ross said before the game Bryant felt better and was expected to take swings in the batting cage. ... RHP Dillon Maples (right triceps) was placed on the 10-day IL. ... C P.J. Higgins (right forearm strain) was shifted to the 60-day IL to make room for Stock. Ross said tests revealed a significant injury for Higgins, who was hurt while making a throw against the San Diego Padres on June 9.	Mets: RHP Miguel Castro (stiff neck) pitched for the first time since Friday and tossed a hitless seventh. ... RF Michael Conforto (right hamstring) began a rehab assignment with Triple-A Syracuse and went 1 for 3. Conforto was injured May 16. ... RHP Dellin Betances (right shoulder impingement) gave up five runs while recording just one out Wednesday afternoon in his second rehab appearance for Class A St. Lucie.	UP NEXT	Cubs: RHP Kyle Hendricks (8-4, 4.46 ERA) will look to extend his career-long winning streak to seven starts in the series finale.	Mets: RHP Marcus Stroman (6-4, 2.23 ERA) has thrown at least six innings in seven consecutive starts, the longest stretch of his career.	------	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

HOUSTON -- — José Altuve started this game the same way he ended the one before.	With a bang.	Altuve homered twice and made major league history by hitting a leadoff homer one game after belting a walk-off grand slam to lead the Houston Astros over the Texas Rangers 8-4 on Wednesday night.	Altuve, whose grand slam in the 10th inning Tuesday night lifted the Astros to a 6-3 victory, became the first player to launch a leadoff homer in the game after hitting a walk-off slam, according to STATS.	“This is a remarkable streak that he’s on," Houston manager Dusty Baker said. “He’s swinging like a power hitter."	Altuve was not made available to reporters after the game.	The diminutive second baseman connected again with a shot to the train tracks atop left field with two outs in the eighth inning to extend the lead to 8-4 and give him his fifth career multi-homer game.	“It’s some of the craziest things I’ve seen from a baseball player," Houston outfielder Myles Straw said. “But I’m not surprised. He’s one of the best players I’ve ever seen."	Astros rookie Chas McCormick also connected twice for his first game with multiple homers on a night when Houston went deep a season-high six times.	Altuve’s leadoff drive was one of a career-worst four homers allowed by Jordan Lyles (2-5) that put the Astros up 5-1 early. McCormick, Martín Maldonado and Straw also connected off Lyles, who began his career in Houston.	“They made me pay for most of my mistakes over the plate," Lyles said. “This is a very good lineup. Every ball that I threw over the plate went for an extra-base hit or over the wall. I’ve got to do a little bit better command-wise."	McCormick's second homer came against Taylor Hearn in the sixth.	Houston starter Zack Greinke (7-2) permitted four hits and three runs in 5 2/3 innings to bounce back after allowing seven hits and four runs over three innings in a loss to Boston last time out, the shortest outing of his Astros career.	“It was a semi-sharp game," Greinke said. “I didn’t make a lot of good pitches the last inning. But overall, just a lot of decent stuff."	Houston played most of the game without third baseman Alex Bregman after he exited with a strained left quadriceps he injured running to first base in the first inning.	Baker said he didn't know the severity of Bregman's injury, but the slugger could be out for “a while."	“The way he walked into the clubhouse, it wasn’t a good sign," Baker said. “You hate to lose him for any amount of time."	Lyles plunked Carlos Correa with one out in the second before McCormick’s home run to right field made it 3-0. Maldonado connected on his solo shot with two outs in the second and Straw hit his first home run of the season in the fourth.	Texas rookie Eli White hit the first two home runs of his career with solo shots in the third and seventh as the Rangers lost for the fourth time in five games. Nick Solak had a two-run single in the sixth that cut the lead to 5-3 before McCormick’s second homer.	Lyles yielded seven hits and five runs with three strikeouts in 4 1/3 innings.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Rangers: RHP Ian Kennedy, who had been out since June 6 with a strained left hamstring, was activated from the injured list. LHP Hyeon-jong Yang was optioned to Triple-A Round Rock.	Astros: OF Kyle Tucker was placed on the injured list because of health and safety protocols. INF Abraham Toro was recalled from Triple-A Sugar Land.	THEY SAID IT	White on hitting the first two homers of his career: “That was super cool and was something I’ve dreamed about since I was a little kid and fell in love with this game."	UP NEXT	Rangers: Texas is off Thursday before Mike Foltynewicz (1-7, 5.48 ERA) starts the opener of a three-game series against Minnesota on Friday night. Jose Berrios (7-2, 3.49) goes for the Twins.	Astros: Jose Urquidy (4-3, 3.77) opposes White Sox right-hander Dylan Cease (5-2, 3.38) in the opener of a four-game series Thursday night.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

SAN FRANCISCO -- — Hours before first pitch, many of the Arizona Diamondbacks were busy working in an outdoor weight room at Oracle Park as others prepared for their pregame fielding drills.	The little things aren't leading to winning results right now, which makes the constant losing all the more painful. Manager Torey Lovullo is searching for answers from his own staff as well as baseball friends everywhere who might offer something that works.	Arizona dropped its 22nd straight road game Wednesday night, matching the 1963 Mets and '43 Philadelphia Athletics for the major league record with a 13-7 loss to the San Francisco Giants.	“This is obviously nothing that we ever expected, nothing that we're proud of, and we can't reverse anything that's happened over the past 40-plus days," Lovullo said. “We've got to find a way to win a baseball game tomorrow.”	Buster Posey hit a three-run homer in a first inning that lasted 43 minutes, while Steven Duggar and LaMonte Wade Jr. connected in the fourth as San Francisco sent its NL West rival to a 13th consecutive loss overall. Pinch-hitter Wilmer Flores added a two-run drive in the fifth and Brandon Belt hit his ninth homer that inning.	Giants starter Anthony DeSclafani (7-2) pitched a two-hit shutout against the Nationals on June 11 and followed that with another impressive performance to win his third straight start. The right-hander allowed two runs on five hits, struck out five and walked one over five innings.	Cabrera homered and Ketel Marte hit a two-run double in the D-backs' five-run sixth.	“It’s really hard because we’ve been working hard every day,” third baseman Asdrúbal Cabrera said. “I feel bad for me and my teammates because I know we’re working hard.”	Arizona jumped ahead 2-0 in the first against DeSclafani — but that could hardly feel comfortable for the D-backs a day after they squandered a 7-0 advantage when Mike Yastrzemski hit a grand slam with two outs in the eighth inning for a 9-8 Giants' victory.	“I think last night helped us remember, or a better way to put that is reminded us, that we have big innings in us and we have the ability to grind out at-bats and wear pitchers down,” Giants manager Gabe Kapler said.	On Wednesday, Josh Rojas hit the third pitch of the game for a double and scored moments later on Wade’s error in left field when he over ran a liner by Marte. Eduardo Escobar doubled to left one out later.	After Brandon Crawford's one-out walk in the first, D-backs catcher Stephen Vogt tried six pickoff attempts at first before Donovan Solano's swinging strikeout. Jason Vosler followed with an RBI double against Arizona righty Merrill Kelly (2-7) .	Kelly, who entered the game holding opponents to a .235 average over his previous four road starts, was knocked out after three innings. He had three of his team's nine walks.	“We're all searching for those types of answers,” Kelly said of what's not working. “... At the end of the day this is our job. Whether we like it or not, whether things are going the way that we want them to go, there's nowhere to hide. We've got to come in tomorrow and try our best to forget about today and do the things that we need to do or do the things that we think we need to do in order to try to win tomorrow.”	DODGER SIGHTING	Former Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros caught the ceremonial first pitch for L.A.'s top rival thrown by Spencer Milken on his birthday. The teen is the grandson of Michael Milken, who works closely with MLB’s Home Run Challenge, and Karros is an ambassador for Milken’s Prostate Cancer Foundation.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Diamondbacks: RHP Taylor Clarke, who went on the injured list Tuesday with a strained muscle in his pitching shoulder, told the team of the discomfort he was experiencing but Lovullo remains optimistic about Clarke making a strong comeback. “He's on the mend, I don't know what the time frame is,” Lovullo said. “We're all encouraged about where he is. ... We're going to miss him.”	Giants: RHP John Brebbia, working back from Tommy John surgery, pitched back-to-back days Monday and Tuesday for Triple-A Sacramento at Tacoma and is expected to pitch again Saturday after a few days off. “Everything went according to plan and I think he's bouncing back well,” Kapler said.	UP NEXT	Dbacks RHP Zac Gallen (1-1, 3.04 ERA) is set to return from the injured list from a sprained pitching elbow to start the series finale Thursday afternoon, his sixth appearance of the year and first since May 7.	“Feeling good, feeling strong, worked on the things that we thought were giving me some trouble, tried to clean those up,” Gallen said. “Excited to get back.”	RHP Kevin Gausman (7-1, 1.43) pitches for San Francisco.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

SEATTLE -- — Nelson Cruz hit a three-run homer against his former team, rookie starter Bailey Ober struck out six and the Minnesota Twins beat the Seattle Mariners 7-2 on Wednesday night.	Cruz’s second-deck shot to left field in the fifth inning made it 6-0 and helped snap the Twins’ three-game losing streak. It was his 431st career home run, moving him into a tie with Lou Gehrig at 49th on the career list.	“It's fun to watch," Minnesota manager Rocco Baldelli said. “His at-bats are explosive and when he hits a ball like he did today, it gets your attention right away.”	Twins third baseman Josh Donaldson left after scoring in the first inning with a right shin strain. Shortstop Andrelton Simmons was also injured, leaving after the fourth with a recurring left ankle sprain. The team said both are day to day and will take advantage of Thursday's day off.	Ryan Jeffers followed Cruz two batters later with a solo homer in the fifth inning. Jorge Polanco led off the game with a double against Mariners starter Justus Sheffield (5-6) and had three hits and three runs by the fifth inning, all against the left-hander.	“From the get-go the Twins came out swinging,” Mariners manager Scott Servais said. “They had a game plan against Sheff. They were going to be very aggressive. Sheff did pound the strike zone, no question about it, but they were on him. The big-time home run by Cruzy created some big separation, kind of took us out of it.”	Ober, a 6-foot-9 right-hander who is on a pitch limit because he did not play last season as a minor leaguer, gave up one hit over four innings with no walks, helping snap Seattle’s three-game winning streak. He threw 63 pitches and lobbied Baldelli to remain in the game.	“He did his job,” Baldelli said. “He could have gone out there again, but we're going to look after him and keep it rolling.”	Ober has given up two runs and eight hits in his last two games with 13 strikeouts over nine innings. He said the key has been to stop tinkering with the grip on his changeup.	“I'm much more comfortable now,” he said.	Reliever Caleb Thielbar (1-0) won on the day he returned to the bullpen from the 10-day injured list. Twins pitchers struck out the Mariners 11 times.	Shed Long Jr. and Ty France had RBI singles for Seattle.	CRUZ-IN’ IN SEATTLE	Cruz continued his home-run dominance at Seattle’s T-Mobile Park with the 84th of his career, just one behind ballpark leader Kyle Seager, Seattle’s third baseman. The designated hitter hit 163 home runs while playing for the Mariners from 2015-18.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Twins: OF Byron Buxton (hip strain) ran for Baldelli before the game in an attempt to prove he’s ready to return from the injured list. Baldelli said Buxton was not able to maintain a full sprint and won't be reinstated until he can do that a couple days in a row. ... RF Max Kepler (left hamstring strain) was scheduled to appear in a rehab game for Triple-A Saint Paul on Wednesday night. If all goes well, he could rejoin the team Friday at Texas.	Mariners: RF Mitch Haniger returned to the lineup after fouling a ball off his knee on Sunday against Cleveland. He was 1 for 4 with a run.	UP NEXT	Twins: After a day off Thursday, RHP José Berríos (7-2, 3.49) takes the mound in the series opener at Texas. He goes for a career high with his sixth straight winning decision.	Mariners: RHP Justin Dunn (1-3, 3.91) faces Tampa Bay on Thursday in the series opener, his first start since ending a major league-leading 15-game streak allowing three or fewer runs.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

LOS ANGELES -- — Zack Wheeler outpitched Clayton Kershaw, and Rhys Hoskins homered early to end an 0-for-33 slump as the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 2-0 on Wednesday night to avoid a three-game sweep.	Hoskins connected in the first inning, J.T. Realmuto added an RBI double in the third and the Phillies rebounded from consecutive defeats to the Dodgers that followed a four-game winning streak.	Los Angeles was shut out for the first time since Sept. 14, 2019.	Wheeler (5-3) gave up five hits with four walks and six strikeouts in six innings. He has thrown 14 scoreless innings over his last two outings, after holding Atlanta without a run for eight innings last Thursday.	“I didn't have my best stuff tonight, obviously; I had four walks,” Wheeler said. “But when you don't have your best stuff, you have to really bear down."	Kershaw (8-5) allowed two runs and eight hits in six innings, with one walk and nine strikeouts.	“The at-bat quality for those guys was really good, so you have to give them a lot of credit,” Kershaw said. “They made me grind. They got my pitch count up, they fouled off a lot of pitches. Overall, I thought I had decent stuff.”	Philadelphia played without second baseman Jean Segura (groin) and outfielder Bryce Harper (back), who were both injured in Tuesday night’s 5-3 loss.	The Dodgers, who are missing three All-Stars in Corey Seager (hand), Max Muncy (oblique) and Cody Bellinger (hamstring), lost for just the second time in nine games.	Left-hander Jose Alvarado followed Wheeler with four strikeouts over two innings. Hector Neris pitched the ninth for his 10th save.	Hoskins’ 13th home run of the season came on a full-count slider from Kershaw. It was his first hit since a first-inning single against Washington on June 5.	“That's a big hit hit for us and Rhys has had a lot of those in these two-run (close) games that we play,” Philadelphia manager Joe Girardi said. “Rhys has had a lot of big homers in those games, so I'm really happy for him.”	The Phillies made it 2-0 in the third when Realmuto ripped a double into right-center that scored Odubel Herrera from first base.	The Dodgers loaded the bases with two outs in the first before Zach McKinstry struck out. They had two aboard in the third and two on with one out in the fifth before Matt Beaty struck out and AJ Pollock grounded out.	“Wheeler, he's got top-notch ace stuff,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. “It's 97-99 (mph) and just enough of a slider to keep you off of the fastball. ... He's a tough one. We had him early, the first two hitters get on base and we couldn't push a run across. Then he just kind of got comfortable and made pitches when he needed to.”	TO THE BRIM	On the second day of full capacity, the Dodgers drew a crowd of 52,157 to push attendance to 104,235 over their last two games. The huge turnout has come after Los Angeles drew just under 16,000 fans over its first 33 home dates amid reduced capacity.	WELCOME BACK	After playing in just 11 games since 2018 following a gruesome knee injury, Steven Souza Jr. was back in the major leagues when the Dodgers purchased the veteran’s contract from Triple-A Oklahoma City.	Souza will pick up some playing time with center fielder Cody Bellinger on the injured list with a hamstring strain. Souza missed all of 2019 with the Arizona Diamondbacks, played a handful of games for the Chicago Cubs last season and was released by the Houston Astros in spring training.	Thinking of retiring, Souza signed a minor league deal with the Dodgers in the spring and hit .279 with six home runs in 22 games at Triple-A before getting called up. He was in right field and batted seventh Wednesday, going 1 for 3 and getting hit by a pitch.	“You know, my wife believed in me and all my family and friends believed it, but when you struggle through an injury for a couple years, and you’re just not doing what you’re used to doing, eventually you start thinking, well, maybe I just can’t do it anymore,” Souza said. “This organization put the belief back in my heart.”	To make room on the roster, the Dodgers designated right-hander Nate Jones for assignment. Jones had an 8.31 ERA in eight relief appearances.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: Segura was placed on the 10-day injured list with a Grade 1 left groin strain that occurred in the ninth inning of Tuesday’s game. He is expected to miss at least three weeks. … Harper is day-to-day with a lower back strain and is considered probable to return Friday in the opener of a three-game series at San Francisco. Harper was injured on a strikeout Tuesday.	Dodgers: All three Dodgers stars on the IL will join the team on the upcoming road trip to Arizona and San Diego. Seager, out since May 15 with a broken right hand, is expected to need a minor league rehab assignment before returning to the active roster. Muncy (oblique) and Bellinger (hamstring) are projected to return immediately to the major league team when healthy.	UP NEXT	Phillies: After an off day Thursday, the Phillies open a three-game series at San Francisco on Friday with right-hander Vince Velasquez (2-1, 4.25 ERA) on the mound.	Dodgers: Begin a three-game series Friday at Arizona with right-hander Trevor Bauer (6-5, 2.64) set to start.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CLEVELAND -- — José Ramírez and Bobby Bradley homered during a three-run first inning and the Cleveland Indians beat the Orioles 10-3 on Thursday, extending Baltimore’s road losing streak to 19 games.	The Orioles are approaching the major league record of 23 consecutive road losses, an active streak set by Arizona later Thursday in San Francisco. The 1943 Philadelphia Athletics and 1963 New York Mets had lost 22 straight road games.	The win gave Cleveland a four-game sweep and sent Baltimore to its eighth straight loss overall. Orioles first baseman Trey Mancini admits this has been difficult.	"We’re very frustrated,“ he said. “Nobody likes losing. I’m at the top of the list, I’d say. There’s no room to wallow at this level. You have to get out there the next day and put it behind you and try to win the next game. What’s done is done.”	Cleveland is 10 games over .500 despite a slew of injuries that has left manager Terry Francona literally piecing together his pitching staff on a daily basis.	“We’ll take any success any day we can,” he said. “We told our guys that we’re going to have to figure some things out. But it’s OK when guys are playing like they’re playing and giving the effort.”	Yu Chang had four RBI with a two-run single in the sixth and a two-run homer in the eighth. Trevor Stephan (1-0) pitched 1 2/3 scoreless innings for his first major league win.	Austin Hays and Maikel Franco homered for the Orioles.	Ramírez hit a two-run homer — his 16th of the season — and Bradley hit his fourth since being called up from the minors June 4. Eddie Rosario homered in the fourth off starter Jorge López (2-8).	Indians starter Eli Morgan remained in the game after being struck by a line drive above the right elbow in the first inning. Morgan, making his second major league start, punched out Cedric Mullins on three pitches to start the game. Mancini lined the next pitch to the mound, and the ball hit Morgan on the fly. Chang, playing third base, caught the ball for the out.	Francona and a trainer went to the mound and talked to Morgan, who nodded his head that he wasn’t injured. Morgan took a couple of warmup pitches and remained in the game, earning a pat on the head from Francona and a loud ovation from the crowd.	Mullins was hit on the earflap of his helmet by Kyle Nelson’s pitch in the fourth. Manager Brandon Hyde and a trainer checked on Mullins, who was on one knee for a couple of moments before taking first base.	WELCOME TO THE BIG LEAGUES, KID	Morgan allowed three runs and struck out five in 3 2/3 innings. His first start against Toronto on May 28 came in conditions that saw winds gusting to 45 mph and steady, blowing rain. He allowed six runs in 2 2/3 innings.	Morgan was sent to Triple-A Columbus a few days after that outing but was recalled as Cleveland deals with injuries to its rotation. Shane Bieber, the reigning AL Cy Young Award winner, is shut down for two weeks with a stiff right shoulder, and Zach Plesac broke his right thumb after angrily removing his shirt following a poor outing last month.	“The poor kid, he pitches the first game in a hurricane and pitches the second game where he gets a line drive off his arm,” Francona said. “He competed like crazy.”	HOME LOOKS GOOD	Hyde is looking forward to returning to Camden Yards, but the Orioles' next six games are against Toronto and Houston.	“No one is going to feel sorry for us,” he said. "This is a tough league. Good teams expect to come in and beat us. We need to respond and to grind, and we’re going to get out of this.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Orioles: Anthony Santander, who has been dealing with a sore left ankle, was back in right field after being out of the lineup and pinch hitting Wednesday.	Indians: C Austin Hedges was placed on the 7-day concussion injured list. He was hit in the helmet by a pitch Friday and took a foul tip off his mask Tuesday. ... OF Jordan Luplow (sprained right ankle) was transferred to 60-day IL. ... C Ryan Lavarnway had his contract purchased from Triple-A Columbus.	UP NEXT	Orioles: RHP Bruce Zimmermann will start against Toronto on Friday night.	Indians: RHP J.C. Mejia will pitch Friday night when Cleveland opens a three-game series in Pittsburgh, which has lost 10 straight.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN FRANCISCO -- — Occasionally, the Arizona players glanced up at the Oracle Park scoreboard in center field. It told a most familiar, gloomy story.	The Diamondbacks made dubious history, setting a major league record with their 23rd straight road loss in getting trounced by the San Francisco Giants 10-3 Thursday.	“It’s nothing we’re proud of,” manager Torey Lovullo said. “It’s been an extended period of time. It weighs on you. It’s heavy.”	The dejected D-backs trudged off the field and quietly made their way back to the visiting clubhouse following the final out, breaking a tie with the 1963 Mets and ’43 Philadelphia Athletics for road futility.	Held to just a single through six innings — and that lone hit came off the bat of pitcher Zac Gallen — Arizona fell behind 6-0. The Diamondbacks went feebly, helpless to stop this runaway train of despair that began nearly two months ago.	“Obviously, the mood is unhappy,” Gallen said. “Guys are definitely not satisfied with the way they’re playing. I don’t know anybody in their right mind who would be.”	The MLB mark felt almost inevitable after Tuesday’s collapse, which saw Arizona blow a 7-0 lead in an anguishing 9-8 loss to the Giants.	Lovullo's team has lost 14 in a row overall and 28 of its last 30, falling to 20-50 for the worst record in the majors.	“I lay in bed at night thinking about different things,” Lovullo revealed. “Sometimes I’m up until 3, 4 o’clock in the morning trying to put the pieces of this puzzle together in my own head. It’s tough. It’s very challenging.”	The Diamondbacks' only consolation coming off this four-game sweep: They don't play again on the road until June 25 at San Diego, exactly two months to the day since their last road victory. Then again, Arizona isn't scheduled for a road game against a sub-.500 team until July 27 at Texas.	Plus this: The Diamondbacks aren't the only team struggling away from home. Baltimore lost its 19th straight road game Thursday, also falling by the same 10-3 score at Cleveland.	Arizona’s last road win came April 25 at Atlanta, when Madison Bumgarner pitched a seven-inning no-hitter to complete a doubleheader sweep. At that point, the Diamonbacks were a solid 9-8 away from Chase Field, with no signs of the trouble ahead.	Since then, the Diamondbacks have been swept on the road by the Marlins, Mets, Dodgers, Rockies, Brewers, Athletics and Giants.	Arizona has been outscored 137-60 in those road losses. Last week, Lovullo fired hitting coach Darnell Coles and assistant hitting coach Eric Hinske.	The 1963 Mets and ’43 Athletics, incidentally, were both guided by Hall of Fame managers toward the end of their tenures. Casey Stengel turned 73 on the day the Mets ended their slide, while Connie Mack was 80 while Philadelphia skidded.	“We’ve got to find a way to go out and, before the next road trip, win a baseball game tomorrow,” Lovullo said. “That’s my focus and that will be the focus of everybody else, too.”	Gallen (1-2) allowed four earned runs in 2 2/3 innings in his first start back from a sprained pitching elbow. The right-hander also recorded Arizona’s first hit of the afternoon, a third-inning single off Giants starter Kevin Gausman.	Gausman (8-1) limited the D-backs to two runs on four hits in eight masterful innings. The right-hander struck out six and walked one.	Curt Casali homered and drove in four runs for San Francisco, finishing a double shy of the cycle. Steven Duggar went 3 for 3 with an RBI double and Mauricio Dubón and Mike Yastrzemski drove in two runs each as the Giants improved the best record in the majors to 44-25.	Casali’s two-run drive off opened the scoring in the second inning. The Giants catcher legged out his first career triple in the fifth inning, scoring Brandon Belt to make it 6-0. Casali added an RBI single in the seventh.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Giants OF Alex Dickerson (strained upper back) is expected to return Saturday when he’s eligible to come off the 10-day injured list. “I would expect him to be in the lineup Saturday,” manager Gabe Kapler said. “That’s not set in stone but that’s my expectation right now.” ... INF/OF Darin Ruf could also be activated as early as this weekend. He has been on the IL since May 27 with a strained right hamstring.	ROSTER MOVE	The Diamondbacks activated Gallen from the IL before Thursday’s game and optioned RHP Humberto Castellanos to Triple-A Reno.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: LHP Caleb Smith (2-2, 3.61 ERA) takes the hill Friday night as Arizona returns home for a three-game series against the Dodgers.	Giants: RHP Johnny Cueto (4-3, 4.00) opens a three-game series against the Phillies. Cueto is 1-5 lifetime against Philadelphia.	—-	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BUFFALO, N.Y. -- — Giancarlo Stanton hit a go-ahead homer in a four-run seventh inning and the New York Yankees pulled off a wacky triple play Thursday night in an 8-4 win over the reeling Toronto Blue Jays.	Stanton broke a 3-all tie with his 13th homer, an opposite-field, two-run shot off Anthony Castro (1-2). The triple play in the first inning marked the first time the storied Yankees franchise turned two in one year.	Chris Gittens came off the bench to drive in three runs, and Gio Urshela had three hits and scored three runs for New York, which swept the three-game series and finished 5-3 on its road trip.	Chad Green (1-4) was the winning pitcher.	“This was a big series for us,” manager Aaron Boone said. “To come up here, coming off a tough weekend, to really bounce back and have some gut-check wins, come from behind and have people contributing, it was exciting.”	Reese McGuire had three hits and Santiago Espinal scored twice for Toronto, which has lost four straight and six of eight. Randal Grichuk gave the Blue Jays a 4-3 lead in the sixth with an RBI single, bringing them back from a 3-0 deficit.	Later in the sixth, Aaron Judge robbed Cavan Biggio of a home run, reaching over the right-field wall to record a 358-foot out.	A few minutes later, Stanton hit his decisive homer.	“He saved two runs and I hit two runs,” Stanton said. “We basically did the same thing. I let a fastball get deep and used the whole field.”	Judge's catch wasn't the Yankees' only significant defensive play, as New York turned its triple play mere weeks after pulling one off May 21 against the Chicago White Sox.	Yankees starter Michael King had runners on second and third with no outs when Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit a tapper to King, who threw to first for the out. First baseman DJ LeMahieu then threw to shortstop Gleyber Torres at second base, with both Toronto runners in limbo.	Torres threw to catcher Gary Sánchez, who tossed to third baseman Urshela for the tag on Marcus Semien between third and home. Urshela alertly threw back to Torres, who tagged Bo Bichette as he slid into third on a close play that was reviewed.	“I called it my Houdini act,” King said. “It's good luck. A little poor baserunning by them, and I'm glad I escaped it.”	“We didn't do a good job on that," Toronto manager Charlie Montoyo said. “Young kids are going to make mistakes. After that, I'm proud that we regrouped and had a lead."	The 1-3-6-2-5-6 sequence was the first time that combination was used in any of the 726 triple plays in major league history, per a list maintained by Baseball Almanac.	“Everybody got involved and played good catch," Boone said. “Who knows where that inning goes if Vladimir gets on?”	For his part, Urshela was trying to keep things simple.	“We were just trying to get an out,” Urshela said. “I tagged the runner, turned around and had the opportunity to get the third out.”	Blue Jays left-hander Taylor Saucedo made his major league debut and had a strikeout in one inning.	RIGHT AT HOME	The three-game series, played at Toronto’s temporary home in Buffalo, drew crowds predominantly clad in Yankees gear and cheering as if the Blue Jays were the visitors. Both managers noticed the difference.	“It’s been definitely unique,” Boone said. “You can definitely feel their presence and the excitement. It’s been nice to hear them behind us and know how excited they are to see us come in. That’s been pretty cool to witness.”	Montoyo had a more resigned reaction.	“The first week here it was really cool, the support we had,” he said. “It is what is is and we’re gonna deal with it. But of course it felt weird.”	YANKEES DEAL FORD	The Yankees traded 1B Mike Ford to the Tampa Bay Rays for $100,000 and a player to be named. Ford was designated for assignment Saturday when reliever Zack Britton was activated from the injured list.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Yankees: Torres left after three innings with lower back stiffness and will undergo further evaluation Friday. Boone said Torres was doing well after getting treatment and it didn't appear to be a serious injury. ... RHP Darren O’Day (strained rotator cuff) had his latest bullpen and will throw another one Friday or Saturday before starting a rehab assignment. ... LHP Justin Wilson (strained right hamstring) is slated to do some bullpen work Friday.	Blue Jays: RHP Carl Edwards Jr. (strained oblique) was transferred to the 60-day IL to make room on the roster for OF Jared Hoying, who was promoted to the active roster. ... RHP Rafael Dolis (strained right middle finger), who left Wednesday’s game after four pitches, was placed on the 10-day IL. ... OF Teoscar Hernández was placed on the paternity list. ... OF George Springer (quad strain) played six innings in center field in a rehab game for Triple-A Buffalo and went 1 for 4 with an RBI double in Rochester. He is 2 for 12 in three rehab games.	UP NEXT	The Yankees return home Friday to face Oakland. RHP Jameson Taillon (1-4, 5.74 ERA) pitches against Athletics RHP James Kaprielian (3-1, 2.51).	Toronto travels to Baltimore, where LHP Robbie Ray (4-2, 3.45) opposes Orioles LHP Bruce Zimmermann (4-4, 4.83) in the series opener.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

DENVER -- — Chicago Cubs prospect Brennen Davis homered twice in the thin air of Coors Field and Cincinnati's José Barrero, Colorado's Michael Toglia and the Mets' Francisco Alvarez also went deep to lead the National League over the American 8-3 Sunday in the Futures Game of top young talent.	Davis, promoted to Double-A on June 1, sent a fourth-inning fastball from Minnesota’s Josh Winder to the trees beyond the center field wall, then hit a slider from Baltimore's Marcos Diplan to left in the sixth, combining with Alvarez for consecutive home runs.	Davis was selected MVP.	Coors Field is known for offense and will be showcased during Monday night's Home Run Derby and Tuesday night's All-Star Game.	Top pitchers on display included Tampa Bay's Shane Baz, a 22-year-old right-hander expected to start for the U.S. at Olympics. He struck out two in a perfect second inning, throwing a fastball at up to 98.5 mph.	Matthew Liberatore, a 21-year-old St. Louis left-hander blocked from the Olympics by the Cardinals after pitching twice in qualifying, opened with a perfect first for the National.	Prospects were mostly slowed last year by the cancellation of minor league seasons due to the pandemic.	Barrero played 24 games for the Reds last year as José Garcia and changed his name in May to honor his mother, who died of COVID. He hit a solo homer in the first on a fastball from Texas' Cole Winn.	Topia got big cheers from the Rockies' crowd when he made it 3-0 in the third on a sinker from the Rangers' Cole Ragans.	Nolan Gorman added an RBI double against Boston's Bryan Bello and San Diego's Luis Campusano boosted the lead to 5-0 with a sacrifice fly.	The AL had one hit until the last inning of the seven-inning game, when Boston's Jeter Downs hit a two-run double and Toronto's Austin Martin followed with an RBI single.	----	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

ATLANTA -- — Charlie Morton made a small tweak to his mechanics that produced a big change in how he drives the ball from the mound.	“I’ve been aware of some of the things that I’ve been doing poorly in my delivery," he said. “It’s really hard, particularly in-season, to make adjustments."	Didn't look that way Thursday night.	Morton didn't allow a hit until the seventh inning and took a shutout into the eighth, lifting the Atlanta Braves over the St. Louis Cardinals 4-0.	Morton gave up his first hit when Paul Goldschmidt lined a single to left-center with one out, but the right-hander followed by getting Nolan Arenado to pop up and struck out Tyler O’Neill. He allowed singles to Matt Carpenter and pinch-hitter José Rondón in the eighth and was pulled with two outs.	“I made some changes in my delivery, like postural stuff, try to stay a little bit taller at the waist," Morton said. “So with the hope that I could stay on line a little better. I feel like I’ve thrown the ball pretty well the past month. My last one in Miami wasn’t great, but overall I think I’m trending in the right direction. I think we did a pretty good job tonight."	Atlanta led 1-0 in the fifth on Guillermo Heredia’s third homer. Ozzie Albies had an RBI triple in the sixth, and Abraham Almonte followed with an RBI double to make it 3-0.	Ronald Acuña Jr.’s sacrifice fly in the seventh pushed it to 4-0.	Luke Jackson struck out Tommy Edman to strand the runners after replacing Morton (6-3), who allowed three hits and no walks with seven strikeouts.	Morton and Cardinals starter John Gant didn’t allow a hit early on, but they weren’t perfect. Gant gave up a walk to Almonte to begin the second. Morton allowed two baserunners when he hit Carpenter with a pitch in the third and did the same to Dylan Carlson in the fourth.	“I thought with the stuff he had, I thought this might be,” Braves manager Brian Snitker said. "You know, Goldschmidt had a great at-bat there, too. That shows you how hard it is to accomplish that.”	Acuña singled to open the fourth, and Freddie Freeman followed with a single, but the inning ended when Austin Riley lined out to third.	Morton, who entered 2-12 with a 5.68 ERA in 18 career starts against St. Louis, avoided his tendency this season to allow a big inning. With his fastball topping out at 96 mph, the right-hander mixed in his curveball and cutter to strong effect. He threw 75 of 112 pitches for strikes and faced 27 batters.	Morton benefited from a strong play when Freeman jumped at first base to stab Edman’s liner to end the sixth.	Acuña walked to begin the sixth, stole second, advanced on Freeman’s groundout and scored on Albies’ triple to left-center to make it 2-0. That chased Gant, who was replaced by Daniel Ponce de Leon. Almonte followed with his RBI double.	Gant (4-5) allowed four hits, three runs and two walks with four strikeouts in 5 1/3 innings.	Gant made a mistake on Heredia's homer.	“Super hung it," Gant said. “It was probably above the strike zone, I would think. I hadn’t gone back and looked at it, but that wasn’t a competitive pitch whatsoever. He liked it a whole lot."	The three-time defending NL East champion Braves, who began the night 7 1/2 games back in the division, had dropped six of seven and were five games under .500 for the first time since the end of the 2017 season.	The Cardinals entered three games back in the NL Central but had won three straight after losing nine of 10.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Cardinals: Edman was back in the lineup and went 0 for 4 after missing the last two games with torso tightness. ... 2B Edmundo Sosa was not available after getting hit by a pitch in the right hand in Wednesday’s win over Miami. “He’s got range of motion to some degree,” manager Mike Shildt said. “He hasn’t been able to get out and test it from a baseball activities standpoint and so we’re not sure about his availability tonight. It was scary.”	Braves: RHP Mike Soroka is still in a walking boot following exploratory surgery last month and has no immediate timetable for when he can resume baseball activities. Soroka said the internal sutures didn’t dissolve as they were supposed to from the original Achilles tendon surgery last August. The tendon is fully repaired. “They were basically floating around in there creating a bunch of inflammatory tissue response, and that’s what I was feeling,” Soroka said. “(The surgeon) got in there and took them out. They were sitting right on top.”	LOOKING BACK	The Cardinals played their first game at Truist Park since winning 13-1 in Game 5 the 2019 NLDS.	HE’S HOT	Acuña went 1 for 2 with one walk to reach safely in his 25th consecutive game, the longest active on-base streak in the majors. His run began May 18 and he began the night with a .411 on-base percentage during that span.	UP NEXT	St. Louis RHP Carlos Martinez (3-7, 5.54) faces LHP Max Fried (3-4, 4.62) in the second game of a four-game series.	----	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

HOUSTON -- — Jose Altuve homered for the fourth time in three games, Michael Brantley and Abraham Toro also connected, and the Houston Astros beat the Chicago White Sox 10-2 on Thursday night.	“He continues to amaze us hitting the ball out of the ballpark," manager Dusty Baker said of Altuve, who leads the team with 16 homers. “We'll take all he can give us.”	Jose Urquidy (5-3) pitched seven strong innings to stifle Chicago's powerful lineup, backed by a three-run shot from Brantley and a career-best four RBI by Toro. Houston won its fourth straight.	There were two on in the first when Brantley knocked his homer off Dylan Cease (5-3) into the seats in right field.	Toro, who entered without an RBI in six games this season, drove in two runs with a single during Houston’s four-run fourth and hit a two-run shot that pushed the lead to 10-2 in the seventh.	Baker has been impressed with Toro's performance since being recalled from Triple-A Sugar Land on Tuesday. The Astros will need his contributions, with third baseman Alex Bregman out indefinitely with a quadriceps injury.	“It’s good to come up here and see that your hard work and improvements paid off so quickly," Baker said. “With Bregman out, everybody has to do a little bit more. He did a lot more."	Altuve homered off Matt Foster, a solo shot with one out in the sixth. The star second baseman hit a walk-off grand slam in the 10th inning against Texas on Tuesday night before slugging two homers in a win over the Rangers on Wednesday night.	“I’m not going up there trying to hit a homer," Altuve said. “But I’m getting good pitches and hitting the ball pretty hard. I’m just happy we’re winning some games."	Cease yielded four hits and a season-high seven runs — six earned — in 3 1/3 innings to tie his shortest start of the season.	“He’s been outstanding," White Sox manager Tony La Russa said. “Today was the first game where his secondary stuff was inconsistent."	Cease settled down after Brantley’s homer and retired his next nine batters before getting into trouble in the fourth. He walked Yuli Gurriel to start the inning before plunking Yordan Alvarez.	Carlos Correa’s ground-rule double scored Gurriel to make it 4-0. Toro’s single came next to put Houston up 6-0.	“They’re obviously a good offensive team and if you put them in hitters' counts it’s going to be tough," Cease said.	Toro stole second base and advanced to third on a wild pitch. Cease walked Jason Castro with one out to end his night. Zack Burdi took over, and Altuve scored Toro with a sacrifice fly.	Urquidy permitted four hits and two runs with five strikeouts. He retired 10 straight before Brian Goodwin opened the sixth with a double. Goodwin moved to third on a groundout by Tim Anderson for the second out and scored on a single by Adam Engel that made it 7-1.	Yoán Moncada walked, and a single by José Abreu scored another run to cut the lead to 7-2.	TRAINER’S ROOM	White Sox: OF Adam Eaton was placed on the injured list with a strained right hamstring. Burdi was recalled from Triple-A Charlotte.	Astros: Bregman was placed on the injured list with a strained left quadriceps after he was injured Wednesday night. Baker said there isn’t currently a timetable for Bregman's return. ... C Garrett Stubbs was recalled from Sugar Land to take Bregman's roster spot.	SEPTUAGENARIANS	La Russa, who is 76, and Baker, who turned 72 this week, are the two oldest managers in the majors, and Thursday night marked the first MLB game with two managers who were 70 or older since San Francisco’s Felipe Alou (71) and Washington’s Frank Robinson (70) met on Aug. 2, 2006.	It was the first meeting between La Russa and Baker since Sept. 4, 2011, when Baker’s Reds beat the Cardinals 3-2.	UP NEXT	Chicago LHP Carlos Rodon (6-2, 1.89 ERA) will oppose Luis Garcia (5-4, 2.98) when the series continues Friday night.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

SAN DIEGO -- — The first sellout crowd at Petco Park since 2019 was treated to Fernando Tatis Jr.'s electrifying solo home run in the sixth inning and Victor Caratini's game-winning, two-run shot in the ninth.	In between, Manny Machado and Eric Hosmer also homered for the Padres, who recovered from closer Mark Melancon's blown save in Cincinnati's four-run ninth to take a 6-4 thriller against the Reds on Thursday night.	“It felt like more than a win, for a lot of reasons,” manager Jayce Tingler said as fireworks went off over the downtown ballpark to put a capper on what was billed as “San Diego's Opening Day.”	Caratini homered two batters after Eric Hosmer hit a tying, two-run homer in the ninth, a crazy finish on a night when the Padres, who made the playoffs last year after a 13-year drought, celebrated the ballpark returning to full capacity following the state's reopening plan that went into effect Tuesday.	But the Padres had to work for this one after the Reds rallied for four runs in the ninth against Melancon, including a go-ahead, two-run homer by rookie Jonathan India.	Machado drew a leadoff walk against Ryan Hendrix and Hosmer homered with one out. Amir Garrett (0-2) came on and allowed Jake Cronenworth's single and then Caratini's shot into the left-field seats. It was Hosmer's sixth homer and Caratini's fifth.	“It was the first time Melancon’s really given up anything without an inherited runner, so to be able to pick him up after so many times he’s picked us up through the year, and then the magical finish there." Tingler said. “This one feels like more than just a regular win.”	The Padres won for just the second time in nine games. They were coming off a 1-5 trip to New York and Colorado, including a three-game sweep by the Rockies, that Tingler described as “just terrible.”	The Reds saw their six-game winning streak snapped.	The Padres took a 2-0 lead into the ninth after Tatis and Machado homered off Wade Miley. Melancon was one out away from his big league-leading 20th save before he melted down against the red-hot Reds.	Joey Votto started the Reds' rally with a leadoff single and Tucker Barnhart doubled. Kyle Farmer had an RBI groundout before pinch-hitter Tyler Stephenson tied it with a two-out single.	India homered to give the Reds a 4-2 lead and quiet the crowd. It was his sixth.	Pierce Johnson (2-2) got the win.	Miley, who threw his first career no-hitter at Cleveland on May 7, had frustrated the struggling Padres until Tatis drove a high-arcing shot that just cleared the wall in left-center for San Diego's first hit with two outs in the sixth. The star shortstop dropped his bat and began his trot after sending the crowd of 40,362 into a frenzy.	It was the 22nd for Tatis, tying his career high set as a rookie in 2019 and matching Vladimir Guerrero Jr. for the major league lead. Tatis was limited to 84 games as a rookie due to injuries.	“He wants to be the best in the game and right now he's doing a lot of good things," Tingler said. "The ball just absolutely explodes off his bat."	Machado hit a monster shot into the second deck in left-center off Miley leading off the seventh, his 10th.	Joe Musgrove, who threw the first no-hitter in the history of his hometown Padres on April 9 at Texas, had been in line for the victory before Melancon's meltdown.	“This meant everything to me," Musgrove said. “It’s been so long since we’ve had a full crowd in there, I swear to God it felt like a playoff game at the start of the game, the nerves I had, the intensity. I had to kind of slow myself down after that first hitter. It was just so much fun, and to pull out the win the way we did makes it even more special.”	The Padres treated this game like a real opening day by hanging bunting and introducing both teams before the game. A giant American flag was unfurled by 275 U.S. Navy sailors prior to the national anthem and there was a flyover of F/A-18 Hornets from Marine Corps Air Station Miramar.	Fans were no doubt a bit nervous as Miley retired 13 straight batters from the first to fifth inning. Until Tatis' home run, the only baserunners Miley allowed were on walks to Tatis in the first and Cronenworth in the fifth.	Musgrove held the Reds to four singles in seven innings, struck out two and walked three.	Miley allowed two runs and four hits seven-plus innings, struck out five and walked two.	“It didn't work out, but if you’re a fan of baseball, that was a cool one,” Miley said.	FLASH THE LEATHER	Hosmer made a nifty play at first base to start a double play in the first inning. After India drew a leadoff walk, Hosmer fielded Jesse Winker's chopper, stepped on first, wheeled and threw to Tatis, who tagged out India. ... In the seventh, Machado, moving from third base to shallow right in a shift, ran down Barnhart's ball and made a sensational off-balance throw to get him at first.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: Tingler said LHP Drew Pomeranz (left shoulder impingement) threw a bullpen and that C Austin Nola is making progress in his recovery from a sprained left knee. Pomeranz has been on the injured list since May 10 and Nola since May 25.	UP NEXT	RHP Tony Santillan (0-0, 1.93) of the Reds and RHP Chris Paddack (3-5, 4.14) of the Padres are scheduled to start Friday night in the second game of the four-game series. Santillan will be making his second big league appearance. He made his debut Sunday at Colorado and left leading 3-1 with the bases loaded and two outs in the fifth. Ryan Hendrix came on and struck out Dom Nuñez to end the inning.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

DENVER -- — Germán Márquez allowed one hit over six scoreless innings, C.J. Cron ignited a five-run first with a grand slam and the Colorado Rockies beat the Milwaukee Brewers 7-3 on Thursday night for their fourth consecutive victory.	Garrett Hampson followed Cron’s slam with a homer, and Raimel Tapia extended his hitting streak to a career-best 14 games with an RBI single in the sixth. “It’s been a great four games,” Cron said. “Coming off that (1-5) road trip we needed to come back here strong. There’s something about this ballpark that we feel super comfortable in and it’s nice to see the offense roll with everybody contributing. We’re scoring a lot of runs and our pitchers are doing a great job.”	Milwaukee committed four errors, one of which led to an unearned run in the sixth, and lost its fourth in a row.	“It wasn’t a pretty defensive game for sure,” manager Craig Counsell said.	Christian Yelich beat out an infield single leading off the fourth for the lone hit against Márquez (5-6). Luis Urias had a three-run double in the seventh off Yency Almonte, who relieved Ben Bowden after he issued three walks to load the bases.	Márquez had to deal with plenty of traffic on the bases after walking three and throwing a pair of wild pitches, including one that rolled to the backstop on a swinging third strike that allowed Jackie Bradley Jr. to reach in the fifth inning. But a Colorado defense that committed three errors also turned three double plays to help Márquez dodge damage. “Honestly, he wasn’t really sharp,” Rockies manager Bud Black said. “His fastball command was spotty. He couldn’t really locate the fastball. The breaking ball got better as the game went on. But he did throw enough quality pitches to record the outs and he got some double play balls that helped him. But I’ve seen him better, honestly. One hit, three walks in six innings, you’d think I’d be praising him but I have high expectations for him. I have high expectations for all of our guys."	Brandon Woodruff (5-3) went five innings and allowed five hits and five runs, all in the first.	Yonathan Daza and Trevor Story singled and Ryan McMahon walked to load the bases before Cron drove a 1-1 pitch into the right-field seats for his third career slam. Hampson followed with a homer that soared into the left-field bleachers. “He made a pitch to Cron that unfortunately got out over the plate, that he got up in the air,” Counsell said. “He hit it pretty good. (Woodruff) was pretty good after that. He cruised through the next three innings. We made some defensive mistakes in the fifth but we got out of it. It’s just a case where a bad inning kind of got us.” POWER SURGE	Cron has three home runs in four games since Monday, snapping a 21-game homerless streak that was the fourth-longest of his career.	“I don’t think I’ve been hitting as many home runs or driving the ball as much as I need to be in the middle of the order. So to get a few here on the homestand has been nice,” Cron said. “It felt good. Glad to contribute.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Brewers: 2B Kolten Wong went through a full range of baseball activities before the game. Barring any setbacks, he could soon be reinstated from the injured list — perhaps this weekend. “We’re close,” Counsell said. Wong, the Brewers’ leadoff batter and a two-time Gold Glove winner with St. Louis, went on the IL on June 4 with a left oblique strain.	Rockies: RHP Mychal Givens has been placed on the 10-day injured list with a lower back strain, and RHP Justin Lawrence was recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque to fill the roster spot. Black said Givens, a mainstay in the bullpen, has been dealing with back soreness for some time. “It was getting to the point where it was nagging, and the medical team and Mychal felt probably the best thing to do was put him on the IL, let it quiet down, and when he comes back, there will be no issues,” Black explained.	UP NEXT	Brewers: RHP Corbin Burnes (3-4, 2.27 ERA) is slated to make his first career start Friday night at Coors Field. He has gone 1-1 with a 9.00 ERA in four previous appearances at the ballpark, all in relief.	Rockies: RHP Antonio Senzatela (2-7, 4.86 ERA) is set to make his fourth career start against Milwaukee but first since Sept. 27, 2019. He’s 1-0 with a 2.40 ERA against the Brewers.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- — Shohei Ohtani hadn't pitched in front of a full, rowdy crowd at Angel Stadium since he was a major league rookie three years ago, and he had missed the feeling.	With 30,709 fans cheering them on, Ohtani and the Angels rode that wave of energy to yet another win.	Ohtani yielded five hits and a run over six strong innings, and Taylor Ward hit his first career grand slam in Los Angeles' 7-5 victory over the Detroit Tigers on Thursday night.	Ohtani (3-1) also drew two walks at the plate for the Angels, who celebrated the Big A's return to full capacity with their 15th win in 23 games. The Halos have improved markedly over the past month even without Mike Trout, and Ohtani's two-way performances are leading the way.	“Definitely felt good pitching in front of a lot of people,” Ohtani said through his translator. “Definitely better than no fans. It gives me energy, gives me confidence. Only good things come out of the fans being there.”	Luis Rengifo and David Fletcher drove in early runs for Los Angeles, and Ward highlighted a five-run seventh by drilling a 418-foot shot to center field for his seventh homer of the season. The Angels stumbled home after a three-game sweep in Oakland interrupted their momentum this week, but Ohtani already sees it returning.	“If we can play the ball we were playing during the winning streak, we can do a lot of good things, so today was a good start,” he said.	Ohtani was on again in his 10th mound start of the season, which matches his total during his AL Rookie of the Year campaign. The Japanese star struck out five and issued just one walk to the Tigers, who didn’t get a runner to third base until Schoop hit his 12th homer in the sixth.	“I thought Shohei illustrated all of his talents today,” said Angels manager Joe Maddon, who pulled his starter after 78 pitches. “He shows you a pretty complete game of baseball. ... I thought that was a pretty significant day’s work for him. It’s still June, and I want this guy to have one of the greatest seasons ever, so I don’t want to jeopardize his overall health.”	Matt Manning (0-1) allowed four hits and two runs over five innings in the touted right-hander’s solid major league debut for Detroit.	Jonathan Schoop homered off Ohtani in the sixth for the Tigers, whose three-game winning streak ended after they rallied too late against the Angels' struggling bullpen.	Detroit manager AJ Hinch praised Manning's effort.	“He walked Ohtani, but I think we should walk Ohtani a lot, to be honest,” Hinch said. “With two runs (allowed while pitching) against Ohtani, it’s going to be tough. But the work we did against Ohtani, we got him out maybe an inning earlier than they would have wanted, and then we got to work against their bullpen.”	Los Angeles had a 7-1 lead heading into the eighth, but reliever Mike Mayers allowed four straight Tigers to reach base and didn't get an out while giving up three runs.	Raisel Iglesias got the final six outs for his 12th save, but he gave up two run-scoring hits in the eighth and allowed another run on a wild pitch in the ninth.	MANNING'S MOMENT	The 23-year-old Manning was the ninth overall pick in the 2016 draft out of high school in Sacramento, and the son of a former NBA player became one of MLB's top pitching prospects.	His development stalled last season due to the coronavirus pandemic and a forearm strain, and Manning hadn't been particularly impressive at Triple-A Toledo this season with an 8.07 ERA and 11 homers allowed in his seven starts. With a rash of pitching injuries and a desire to see what Manning can do at the highest level, the Tigers promoted him anyway.	“I was able to put away some of the emotions part of it and not make it bigger than it was,” Manning said. “I just felt comfortable, and as the game went on, it kept building.”	Manning was largely sharp against the Angels, issuing two walks — both to Ohtani — and striking out three. He allowed two runs in the second largely thanks to his teammates' poor defense.	Manning finished strong in front of dozens of friends and family members — “too many to count,” he said.	“I’m so happy I was able to debut in my home state," he added.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: LHP Matthew Boyd, who left his last start with an arm injury, will meet with Dr. Neal ElAttrache while Detroit is on the West Coast, Hinch said.	Angels: 3B Anthony Rendon (triceps) was out of the lineup for the third consecutive game, clearing the way for Rengifo to get a start.	UP NEXT	After struggling last week in Arizona, Alex Cobb (4-2, 4.98 ERA) looks to get back to his strong recent run of form when he takes the mound for the Angels against José Ureña (2-6, 5.16 ERA), who is 0-2 with a 13.50 ERA in his first two starts in June.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SEATTLE -- — Shed Long Jr. hit a tying double in the bottom of the ninth inning and pinch-hitter Kyle Seager singled home the winning run to rally the Seattle Mariners past the Tampa Bay Rays 6-5 on Thursday night.	Seattle lost starter Justin Dunn to a sore right shoulder after two innings, but came from behind with the help of a two-run homer by Ty France and a solo shot from Luis Torrens.	Dylan Moore drew a four-pitch walk from reliever Pete Fairbanks (1-2) to start the ninth. Jake Bauers singled and Long tied it 5-all with his second double of the game.	Seager batted for Taylor Trammell and singled through the right side of a drawn-in infield to score Bauers from third.	“I wasn’t prepared for it,” Seager joked about his chance to hit. “I was watching the game.”	Seattle manager Scott Servais said Seager, the team's regular third baseman, was supposed to be shut down for the day. But he told him to be ready with the Mariners trailing 5-4 in the top of the ninth inning.	“When it gets to that point in the game and you've only got one bullet to shoot, you might as well shoot it,” Servais said.	Hector Santiago (1-1) struck out three in a hitless inning for the win.	Seattle has won four of five. The Rays are 24-8 in their last 32 games, with the eight losses coming by a total of 12 runs. Five were by one run.	Randy Arozarena hit his 10th home run off Mariners reliever JT Chargois after Ji-Man Choi’s leadoff single in the fourth. Brett Phillips drew a walk, stole second and scored on Brandon Lowe’s single to make it 3-1 in the fifth.	Joey Wendle and Kevin Kiermaier added RBI singles in the sixth to help build a 5-2 lead.	It was the second loss in two days for Fairbanks, who gave up the winning hit Wednesday night in the 10th inning of an 8-7 defeat to the Chicago White Sox. The Rays have dropped three in a row, shaving their AL East lead to a half-game over Boston.	“We've got a good team,” an angry Fairbanks said. “As long as I don't blow it when we take leads into the ninth, when I've got that opportunity, we'll be fine.”	DUNN UPDATE	Dunn said after the game that he started experiencing discomfort in his pitching shoulder during warmups. The right-hander looked strong through two innings, with a strikeout against one hit, but experienced increased discomfort and felt he couldn't return for the third. Dunn spent time on the 10-day injured list earlier this month, returning to the team on June 10.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Rays: RHP Tyler Glasnow (right elbow strain) has been moved to the 60-day injured list and left the team following Wednesday’s game in Chicago to see a specialist in Dallas on Friday. Glasnow blamed the injury on the coming crackdown on illegal foreign substances, forcing him to grip the ball differently than he normally would.	Mariners: Evan White reinjured his strained right hip flexor in a rehab game at Triple-A Tacoma and has returned to Seattle. Servais hopes the setback won’t cost the Gold Glove first baseman more than four or five days. White reinjured himself while running to first.	UP NEXT	Rays: RHP Michael Wacha (1-1, 4.54 ERA) has not pitched more than three innings since returning from the injured list on May 23.	Mariners: LHP Yusei Kikuchi (3-3, 3.67) returns to the mound after pitching seven shutout innings in his last start.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

The Indians rallied by scoring six runs in the seventh inning and three runs in the eighth, cutting the deficit to a run.	Cesar Hernandez hit a grand slam off Sam Howard in the seventh inning, pulling the Indians within 11-7. A two-run single by Rene Rivera and a throwing error by center fielder Bryan Reynolds an inning late made it a one-run game.	Richard Rodriguez pitched a scoreless ninth inning, allowing a pair of singles, for his eighth save in 10 chances. He struck out rookie slugger Bobby Bradley with runners on second and third to end the game.	“I think I drank like five bottles of water (in the late innings). I was sweating it out,” Pirates manager Derek Shelton said. “But I always feel comfortable with Richie on the mound in the ninth regardless of a one-run lead, a four-run lead, whatever lead, that he’s going to close it out.”	Indians three-time Silver Slugger-winning third baseman Jose Ramirez left the game with a bruised left foot after being hit by a pitch in the eighth inning.	The Pirates bullpen nearly blew the double-digit lead after starter Chad Kuhl (1-4) allowed one run in six innings.	“It’s nice to have the win attributed to my name, but I just want to have an outing that gives ourselves a chance to win,” Kuhl said. “What it really comes down to is it’s 10 games, so to put an end to (the losing streak) is really a good feeling, even though it wasn’t easy.”	Hernandez finished with three hits and five RBI as the Indians lost for the second time in eight games. Rivera had three hits and three RBI, and Eddie Rosario added two hits.	“We ask our guys to always continue to play and that was probably the ultimate example,” Indians manager Terry Francona said. “Those are hard games to win but we’re one hit away from maybe winning the game. Just keep playing. Sometimes it’s ugly, sometimes we make mistakes but keep playing.”	Reynolds homered for the Pirates and joined Adam Frazier with two hits.	The Pirates jumped on rookie starting pitcher J.C. Mejia (1-2) early with the big first inning. After the first run scored on a groundout, Jacob Stallings hit a two-run double to the wall in right-center and Polanco followed with a drive into the right-field stands.	Polanco had gone 4 for 20 on the Pirates’ just-completed six-game road trip.	“That was nice, especially coming off a rough road trip,” Polanco sad. “I hit that ball in the first inning and I’m like, ‘Oh yeah.’ That felt good.”	Staked to the early lead, Kuhl scattered four hits with four strikeouts and one walk. He was aided by four double plays.	It was Kuhl’s first win since Sept. 24, 2020. He failed to record a victory in his first seven starts this year. In his last outing, Kuhl was tagged for six runs in 3 1/3 innings in a loss at Milwaukee.	Mejia lasted a career-high five innings, giving up six runs and seven hits while striking out three.	Hayes, a rookie, has reached base in 23 consecutive games dating to last September.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Indians: Francona said Ramirez felt fine by the time he got to the clubhouse. … is considered day to day. … RHP Zach Plesac (broken right thumb) and C Roberto Perez (broken right ring finger) are scheduled to be examined Saturday by Pittsburgh hand specialist Dr. Thomas Graham.	Pirates: 1B Colin Moran (back strain) returned to the starting lineup after being limited to one pinch-hitting appearance in a three-game series at Washington.	UP NEXT	Indians RHP Cal Quantrill (0-2, 3.11) will start Saturday against Pirates RHP Wil Crowe (0-4, 6.75). Quantrill will be pitching on short rest after allowing one run in four innings Tuesday against Baltimore. Crowe had a career-high eight strikeouts in five innings in his last start, a no-decision against Milwaukee last Sunday.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

WASHINGTON -- — Yan Gomes hit a game-ending single in the ninth inning, Erick Fedde extended his scoreless streak to 20 innings and the Washington Nationals two-hit the first-place New York Mets in a 1-0 victory Friday night.	Juan Soto opened the ninth with a walk on a close 3-2 pitch and moved to third on Ryan Zimmerman's single to right. Gomes then singled to left to beat Edwin Díaz (1-2).	“Díaz came in and I thought he got squeezed on that 3-2 pitch, right?” Mets manager Luis Rojas said. “Men on first, defensive alignment is changing. Positioning changing, single and first and third. Now you have a different scenario.”	Brad Hand (4-2) pitched the ninth to close out Washington's gem. The Nationals have won a season-high five straight.	“Right now, we’re playing good baseball,” Gomes said. “So the vibe is awesome.”	Fedde pitched seven dominant innings, allowing two hits and four walks while striking out six. His last out was Tomás Nido's grounder to third, and the typically stoic Fedde yelled and flexed his arms on his way off the field. He later watched Gomes' game-winner from the back.	“I was in the training room screaming like a little kid,” Fedde said.	The right-hander's scoreless streak is the longest on the team this season, one inning more than ace Max Scherzer's earlier run. Fedde began the run May 11, and it spans nearly a month-long stint on the COVID-19 injured list that ended last Saturday.	Fedde’s ERA is down to 3.33. He has been crucial for the Nationals since Stephen Strasburg was placed on the 10-day injured list June 2. Friday night was his second start of seven shutout innings among his last three times on the mound.	“He’s starting to mature,” Gomes said of the 2014 first-round pick. “Starting to learn about the pitcher he is. You’re starting to see the kind of pitcher everyone probably thought he was going to be.”	Joey Lucchesi countered with 5 1/3 scoreless innings, allowing four hits and two walks while striking out five. Three Mets relievers followed with 2 2/3 scoreless before Díaz struggled in the ninth.	“I think first the 3-2 slider to Soto was a strike for me,” Díaz said. “After that pitch, the inning changed completely.”	The Nationals loaded the bases with one out in the third. Trea Turner’s crisp grounder to third was grabbed by Jonathan Villar, who stepped on the bag and threw to first for a double play. The Nationals entered the game 28th in OPS with the bases loaded.	Washington pulled together another threat in the bottom of the sixth when they put two on with one out to chase Lucchesi. Miguel Castro relieved and induced a ground-ball double play on a 3-1 pitch to Zimmerman. The Nationals grounded into three double plays Friday.	CASTRO REJOINS NATIONALS	The Nationals reinstated 3B Starlin Castro from the restricted list on Friday. Castro left the team Tuesday night for “family reasons″ and missed Wednesday’s series finale against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He was not in the starting lineup Friday because Nationals manager Dave Martinez wanted to give him a day to re-acclimate to ’baseball life” as well as see how Castro is doing generally. However, he pinch-hit in the eighth inning.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Nationals: Scherzer (right groin) threw from flat ground Friday before throwing a handful of pitches off the bullpen mound. He is expected to throw a full bullpen session Saturday. Scherzer (5-4, 2.21 ERA) was placed on the 10-day injured list June 15, retroactive to June 12, after getting just one out in his June 11 start.	Mets: RHP Jacob deGrom (right shoulder) threw a light bullpen session on Friday to remain in his regular between-starts routine. Rojas said the process with deGrom is still a “day-by-day” situation, and that deGrom is not experiencing any pain beyond usual post-start soreness. The MLB leader in ERA is expected to throw a full bullpen session Saturday. DeGrom (6-2, 0.54) left his Wednesday start after three innings because of right shoulder soreness.	UP NEXT	RHP Joe Ross (3-6, 4.19 ERA) will pitch Game 1 of a split day-night doubleheader for the Nationals. LHP David Peterson (2-5, 5.60) will pitch Game 1 for the Mets. LHP Jon Lester (0-2, 4.09) will start Game 2 for Washington. New York had not announced its Game 2 starter.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

BALTIMORE -- — Cedric Mullins swatted his second home run of the game, then took a curtain call as the fans at Camden Yards twirled orange shirts in celebration.	The Baltimore Orioles are going through a nightmare on the road right now, but back home against Toronto, they gave their crowd plenty to cheer about.	Mullins homered twice and Thomas Eshelman pitched effectively into the fifth inning to help the Orioles snap their eight-game losing streak with a 7-1 victory over the Blue Jays on Friday night. The Orioles have dropped 19 games in a row on the road, but they have now won six of their last eight at home.	“What a great night for Cedric,” manager Brandon Hyde said. “The crowd was unbelievable tonight. That's the most energy in the ballpark that I've seen here in three years.”	Mullins had three hits, including a homer to lead off the bottom of the first and a three-run shot that capped a five-run eighth for Baltimore. Eshelman, called up from the minors to make this start when the Orioles put Bruce Zimmermann on the injured list, held the powerful Blue Jays without a hit until Lourdes Gurriel Jr. homered in the fifth.	Eshelman allowed three hits in 4 2/3 innings before being relieved by Tyler Wells (2-0). The Baltimore bullpen did not allow a hit until Cavan Biggio singled with two outs in the ninth.	This was Eshelman's first big league appearance of the year. He had a 6.41 ERA with Triple-A Norfolk.	The Blue Jays have lost five straight.	Robbie Ray (4-3) allowed two runs and six hits in 4 1/3 innings, his shortest start of the season. Austin Hays put the Orioles ahead 2-1 with an RBI single in the fifth that chased Ray.	“It was a grind. I felt like I looked up in the first inning after it was over, and I saw 28 pitches, or whatever it was," Ray said. "I felt like it was kind of that way the whole game.”	Ray threw 25 pitches in the first and 106 for the game.	Mullins came into the night trailing Toronto's Vladimir Guerrero Jr. by one for the American League's hits lead. He singled in the fifth to pass Guerrero, who went 0 for 4.	Freddy Galvis hit an RBI double in the eighth and scored on a single by Maikel Franco. Mullins went deep to make it 7-1, delighting the crowd of 13,284, which had received orange shirts with his No. 31 on them as a giveaway.	“That was awesome. First curtain call ever,” Mullins said. “I was kind of nervous to go back out there, but it felt amazing, just to be able to help stretch the lead right there.”	STRUGGLING STANDOUTS	The top five hitters in the Toronto batting order went 1 for 19, with only Biggio's late single preventing a hitless night for that group. Manager Charlie Montoyo stressed that his team isn't panicking during this slump.	“I just met with some players," he said. "The vibe is good. I know it's tough for you guys to believe because you're not here, but I'm telling you, we're going to weather the storm, because they think they will.”	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: Gurriel left the game complaining of back pain.	Orioles: Zimmermann went on the IL before the game with left bicep tendinitis. Hyde said the team is being cautious and giving him time to rest.

ATLANTA -- — Max Fried picked up where Charlie Morton left off a night earlier for the Atlanta Braves.	“It’s exactly what you want to do," Fried said. “Charlie definitely set the tone last night with attacking guys and keeping a good pace, and it felt like I got a little bit off it in the first. I wanted to get back on the attack and throw strikes, and that was kind of the game plan."	Ozzie Albies and William Contreras homered off Carlos Martínez in a four-run second inning, Fried allowed two hits in seven innings, and Atlanta beat the St. Louis Cardinals 9-1 on Friday night.	Contreras’ seventh homer, a solo shot to left, made it 2-1, and Ronald Acuña Jr. kept the inning alive by walking, stealing second base and scoring on Freddie Freeman’s single. Albies, who went 3 for 5 with three RBI, followed with his 10th homer, a two-run shot to right that put Atlanta up 5-1.	The three-time defending NL East champion Braves, who are 5½ games back in the division, have won two straight after losing six of seven. St. Louis, which began the night four games back in the NL Central, has dropped five straight and eight of nine on the road.	The Cardinals were outhit 11-3 and have mustered one run the last two nights at Truist Park.	“We’ve got to be able to separate all these games and know that we’ve got to play tomorrow and we’ve got a chance to win and come together as a group," St. Louis shortstop Paul DeJong said. “I think overall we’re going to keep encouraging each other and know that we’re going to get hot at the right time. We’ve done it over the course of my career here every year. Late-season runs. We’re just going to try to stay in there as much as we can now and try to build some momentum."	One night after Morton didn't allow a hit until the seventh inning of a 4-0 victory over the Cardinals, Fried (4-4) gave up one run and two walks with six strikeouts. The left-hander is 4-3 with a 2.51 ERA in his last eight starts since returning from the injured list with a right hamstring strain.	“His stuff was really good, live down in the zone, good breaking stuff and that’s what it takes," Braves manager Brian Snitker said. “We’ve been scoring enough runs. Hopefully these guys keep feeding off each other. Keep the line moving as far as the starters go. It was good to let the bullpen catch its breath again."	Martínez (3-8) lost his fourth straight decision, giving up eight runs, eight hits and four walks. The right-hander is 1-6 with a 7.52 ERA in eight starts on the road this season.	Atlanta tied it at 1-all in the first when Albies hit his 21st double, third-most in the NL, and scored on Austin Riley’s single.	The Cardinals led 1-0 in the first. Tommy Edman doubled, advanced on a grounder and scored on Paul Goldschmidt’s RBI groundout.	The Braves plated four runs and batted around for a 9-1 lead in the fourth. Acuña was hit by a pitch, advanced to third on Freeman’s single and scored on Albies’ single. Freeman scored on Abraham Almonte’s single, Albies scored on Riley’s sacrifice fly and Almonte scored on a bases-loaded walk to Fried.	“It’s awesome," Albies said. “It’s great. When we go home with a W, every single night, the team is happy. Everybody’s smiling. I know the game is tough, so it changes everything for us."	TRAINER’S ROOM	Cardinals 2B Edmundo Sosa was back in the lineup after getting hit in the right hand by a pitch Wednesday against Miami and went 1 for 3.	MOVING ON UP	Acuña went 0 for 1 with two walks and two hit by pitch, reaching safely for his 26th consecutive game, the longest active streak in the major leagues and the second-longest streak of his career. He had a 32-game run from June 19-July 28, 2019.	NICE MOVES	Yadier Molina threw out Acuña in a stolen base attempt in the first. DeJong applied the tag on the headfirst slide. ... Fried picked off Sosa 1-3-4 to end the second. ... Acuña got some payback by stealing his 15th base in the second. ... Cardinals LF Tyler O’Neill ran hard to his left to track down Dansby Swanson’s fly on the warning track in the sixth.	SLUMPING	Cardinals 3B Nolan Arenado is 0 for his last 20. His average has dropped 20 points to .266 over that span.	UP NEXT	RHP Adam Wainwright (4-5, 3.95) pitches for the Cardinals, and LHP Drew Smyly (3-3, 5.63) takes the mound for Atlanta as the teams continue a four-game series. Wainwright is 9-4 with a 3.63 ERA in 14 career starts and five relief appearances against the Braves. Smyly will face St. Louis for the second time in his career.	----	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO -- — Adam Duvall hit a grand slam and a two-run drive, and the Miami Marlins snapped a four-game slide by pounding the Chicago Cubs 10-2 in a rare Friday night game at Wrigley Field.	Jon Berti added a three-run homer on a warm, windless evening as the Marlins dealt the Cubs their fourth loss in five. Jorge Alfaro had three hits and scored twice as the teams met for the first time since Miami swept Chicago 2-0 in their NL wild-card series in October.	Duvall had three hits. He smacked his fifth career slam to cap Miami’s five-run third inning against shaky Cubs starter Zach Davies. Davies (4-4) gave up a career-high eight runs after not allowing any in his previous two starts.	Duvall’s second homer of the game and 14th of the season came on a towering fly to left off Dan Winkler in the seventh. Duvall has two multihomer games this season and nine for his career.	A hot-and-cold slugger throughout his career, the 32-year-old Duvall is still hitting just .215 this year.	But when Duvall starts connecting, the results can be explosive.	“When it's hot, it's not usually solos, it's multiple runs,” manager Don Mattingly said. “He is just kind of instant hot. You just don't know with Duvy, but it's dangerous when it's hot.”	Duvall said he tries to be more consistent than his stats suggest.	“This is what I strive for every day, even if it's not attainable,” Duvall said. “I strive to impact the game in a positive way and be a guy we can lean on to drive in runs and play good defense.”	Joc Pederson hit two solo homers in his first two at-bats. It was Pederson’s second two-homer game this season and 17th of his career.	The Cubs have scored just 11 runs in their last five games following a hot run that propelled them to the top of the NL Central.	“It's a long season,” Pederson said. “I think we just won a lot of games in row led by our offense. If we did that all season, we'd win 120 games. That's not realistic."	Marlins rookie starter Cody Poteet was activated off the 10-day injured list before the game, then left with two outs in the fourth after throwing 80 pitches. The right-hander allowed two runs — on Pederson’s drives — and three hits while walking four and striking out five.	John Curtiss (3-1), the first of three Miami relievers, tossed 1 1/3 innings to earn the win as the Marlins bullpen completed a four-hitter.	Davies allowed eight hits and walked three after not yielding a run in his previous 14 2/3 innings.	The Marlins loaded the bases with one out in the third, then Starling Marté walked to force in Miami’s first run. After Jesus Aguilar popped out, Duvall ripped Davies’ 1-0 pitch into the left-field bleachers.	“To be able to get a pitch that was in my zone with the bases loaded was just the cherry on top,” Duvall said.	FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS	The Cubs played just the ninth Friday night game at Wrigley Field since lights were installed in 1988. Six of them took place in 2020 when no fans were allowed due to COVID-19.	The Cubs got permission from a Chicago City Council committee to play the night home contest because the team knew it would return to Chicago early in the morning after playing the Mets in New York on Thursday night.	Friday and Saturday night games usually are prohibited at the iconic ballpark because they worsen parking and congestion problems when nearby bars and restaurants draw big crowds.	EVEN BIGGER	Duvall hit three homers twice in an eight-game span last season while with Atlanta. He had nine RBI in the second game, on Sept. 9, 2020 as the Braves ripped the Marlins 29-9.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Marlins: Poteet suffered a strained medial collateral ligament in his right knee on June 4. He was able to throw wearing a knee brace while sidelines. ... Miami also activated SS Miguel Rojas (dislocated left index finger) off the 10-day injured list. He started and batted fifth. ... To make room for Poteet and Rojas, the Marlins optioned INF Isan Diaz and OF Lewis Brinson to Triple-A Jacksonville.	Cubs: Manager David Ross said INF Nico Hoerner, out since May 25 with a left hamstring strain, has resumed baseball activities. ... RHP Trevor Williams, who underwent an appendectomy on May 30, also is progressing.	UP NEXT	Marlins RHP Pablo Lopez (2-4, 3.12) faces Cubs RHP Jake Arrieta (5-7, 5.14) on Saturday.	------	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- — The Minnesota Twins are starting to get comfortable in extra innings.	Luis Arraez hit an RBI triple to start the Minnesota 10th and the Twins then drew two bases-loaded walks to beat the Texas Rangers 7-5 on Friday night in the opener of a three-game series matching last-place teams.	“When I hit the ball, I wanted three (bases),” Arraez said. “I’m ready for that moment. Prepared my mind that I needed to move the runner.”	Arraez tripled to deep center field over the head of Adolis García, whose homer in the Texas seventh had tied the game at 4-4, and Willians Astudillo rumbled home from second base. The Twins have won three consecutive extra-inning games since losing their first eight this season.	Josh Sborz (3-3), the sixth Texas pitcher, then struck out two but also had three walks, including an intentional pass to slugger Nelson Cruz before Ryan Jeffers got a free pass  with the bases loaded. Demarcus Evans took over and walked Alex Krilloff to force in another run.	“That was probably the most frustrating part of the game is we gave them the game. Literally, we handed them a win by walking to those two guys,” Texas manager Chris Woodward said. “Getting one run in that scenario with a runner on second and nobody out is what we tell our pitchers, it's OK. It's kind of expected in that situation."	Hansel Robles (3-3) worked a perfect ninth before Tyler Duffey worked the 10th for his second save, allowing a one-out bloop RBI single to Joey Gallo.	Minnesota, at the bottom of the AL Central standings, has won consecutive games for only the second time this month. The AL West last-place Rangers have lost 17 of their last 20 games, and are 9-27 overall since leaving Minnesota after three consecutive wins there the first week of May.	Trevor Larnach had a no-doubt homer for the Twins when he pulled a towering 429-foot blast into the right-field seats with two outs in the fifth to snap a 3-3 tie. Rangers starter Mike Folytnewicz immediately bent down and frustratingly swiped at the dirt on the mound without ever turning to watch the ball.	Arraez drew a walk to start the game, and the Twins loaded the bases with no outs before jumping ahead 3-0. Cruz had an RBI single before Max Kepler drove in a run on a fielder’s choice in his first at-bat after missing 17 games with a left hamstring strain.	“It was a good day in a lot of a different ways up and down the lineup. It took a lot of good at-bats to get where we needed to be tonight,” Twins manager Rocco Baldelli. “We didn't lean on anyone to carry the load and drive in all the runs or anything like that. But we had a lot of guys out there just kind of grinding it out up and down all night.”	SHORT HOPS	García’s two-out solo shot in the seventh off reliever Jorge Alcalá was his 17th of the season, but first in 72 at-bats over 19 games since last going deep May 26. García broke a Rangers rookie record for the most homers before the All-Star break, breaking a tie with Pete Incaviglia’s 16 in 1986. ... Texas is 7-4 in extra innings, 4-1 at home. ... The Twins hadn't had a go-ahead triple in extra innings since Joe Mauer at Seattle on April 26, 2015.	FOR STARTERS	Twins right-hander José Berríos remained stuck on his career-best streak of five consecutive winning decisions, those coming over nine starts since the start of May. The right-hander struck out six and walked one while allowing three runs and six hits before departing with a 4-3 lead after six innings.	“We won. That's the most important thing,” Berríos said.	Foltynewicz had four strikeouts and two walks while allowing four runs in five innings.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Twins: 3B Josh Donaldson (right calf tightness) and SS Andrelton Simmons (left ankle tightness) were both out of the lineup after exiting early from the Twins’ previous game Wednesday. Baldelli said Donaldson was also dealing with an upper respiratory issue that affected his sleep the previous two nights. ... CF Byron Buxton ran on the field and worked out before missing his 39th game since May 6 because of a right hip strain, though he could be activated at some point this weekend. Baldelli said Buxton “ultimately had a very good day."	Rangers: OF David Dahl, out since May 26 because of a bruised left rib cage and then some mid-upper back discomfort after going on the injured list, went through a full workout Friday. He will begin a begin a rehab assignment this weekend.	UP NEXT	Randy Dobnak (1-6, 8.38 ERA) starts the middle game of the series for the Twins against 23-year-old lefty Kolby Allard (2-2, 2.91), who is scheduled to make his fourth start in 14 appearances for Texas this season.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- —	Adalberto Mondesi hit a 464 foot three-run homer, Salvador Pérez added his 18th home run this season, and the Kansas City Royals beat the Boston Red Sox 5-3 on Friday night for only their second win in their last 13 games.	Kansas City trailed 1-0 before Mondesi’s third-inning home run off Nick Pivetta (6-3), Mondesi’s fourth home run in nine games this season. Mondesi has nine RBI.	“That ball was as far ball as you’ll see hit,” Royals manager Mike Matheny said. “He’s a difference maker, and it’s fun to watch.”	Before a season-high crowd of 29,870 at Kauffman Stadium, Kris Bubic (2-2) won despite allowing two runs and five hits in 2 2/3 innings. Greg Holland pitched a perfect ninth for his fourth save, and the Royals stopped their six-game losing streak.	“It was a good win,” Matheny said. “Every one of them is, but they’re a good team.”	Boston’s Christian Arroyo was ejected by plate umpire Jim Wolf after he took a called third strike for the second out of the ninth on a pitch that Arroyo thought was inside.	Whit Merrifield had his fourth straight multi-hit game, including an RBI double in the fifth that boosted Kansas City’s lead to 4-2.	The Red Sox went 2 for 9 with runners in scoring position and stranded eight runners.	Boston faced Kansas City for the first time since dealing outfielder Andrew Benintendi to the Royals on Feb. 10 as part of a three-team trade. Benintendi is missing the series because of a broken rib.	Kansas City used an opener for the first time this season, and Kyle Zimmer allowed three hits in two scoreless innings.	“Coming into the day, there was a few scenarios discussed,” Bubic said. “I just tried to stay ready and prepared for a normal start. I tried to just think one inning at a time.”	Pivetta gave up three runs and six hits in five innings. He is 0-3 in four starts after starting the season 6-0.	“We just need to turn the page and try to tie the series tomorrow,” Red Sox manager Alex Cora said.	Alex Verdugo’s RBI single put Boston ahead in the third, and J.D. Martinez hit a run-scoring single in the fifth that closed the Red Sox to 3-2.	Pérez homered in the seventh off Matt Andriese, a drive just over the wall in right.	Rafael Devers hit his 17th homer, a solo drive in the eighth off Scott Barlow, who had not allowed a home run in 38 innings.	ROSTER MOVES	Royals: OF Edward Olivares was optioned to Triple-A Omaha. The Royals selected the contract of RHP Anthony Swarzak from Omaha and transferred RHP Ronald Bolanos from the 10-day to the 60-day IL.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Red Sox: LHP Chris Sale (Tommy John surgery in March 2020) threw a 40-pitch simulated game at Triple-A Worcester. Sale said he felt good and felt the session was a step in the right direction. His next bullpen session is set for Tuesday.	Royals: LHP Danny Duffy (left forearm flexor strain) threw a bullpen session and could pitch on the trip that starts Tuesday at the New York Yankees.	UP NEXT	LHP Martín Pérez (4-4, 4.52) starts Saturday,	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

HOUSTON -- — After slugging their way to their last four wins, the Houston Astros found a different way to extend their winning streak Friday night.	Yordan Álvarez had a game-ending double in the ninth inning for his third hit and Houston's only extra-base hit, lifting the Astros to a 2-1 victory over the Chicago White Sox.	“There’s going to be nights when everyone isn’t going to hit,” Alvarez said in Spanish through a translator. “So to have somebody to come through and get a big hit for us is what it’s about and it’s what winning teams do.”	It was tied at 1-all when Yuli Gurriel singled off Garrett Crochet (2-3) with one out in the ninth. Álvarez smacked a ball down the right-field line that rolled into the corner, allowing Gurriel to slide home just before the throw to give Houston the victory.	“The plan was just to not get too desperate at the plate," Alvarez said. “Wasn’t trying to hit a home run. I just wanted to make good, solid contact with the ball and that’s what happened."	Luis García allowed one run and seven hits in seven innings, and Ryan Pressly (4-1) struck out the side in the ninth for the win.	“You can’t win the same way every day," manager Dusty Baker said. “A winning streak is usually about that. You find ways to win. We’ve been getting good pitching. We’ve been getting pitching deep into the game. So hopefully we just keep on rolling."	José Altuve cooled off after hitting three homers in four games, going 0 for 4 with two strikeouts. The Astros didn’t homer on Friday night after entering with at least two homers in their previous 10 games to tie a major league record.	García tied a career-high with eight strikeouts. He settled down after the first couple of innings, retiring 13 of his last 14 batters.	Brian Goodwin got things going for the White Sox with a double down the right-field line with one out in the first and he advanced to third on a single by Yoán Moncada. José Abreu followed with a single that scored Goodwin.	“We had some opportunities to add runs the first inning," manager Tony La Russa said. “They just made good pitches and got the outs."	Chicago starter Carlos Rodón yielded one run and three hits with three walks and eight strikeouts in seven innings.	“That’s an impressive offense," he said. “They swing the bat. They take pitches and made me work all night."	Rodón retired his first 13 batters before Alvarez singled with one out in the fifth. Rodón walked Carlos Correa before Abraham Toro singled to load the bases.	There were two outs in the inning when Martín Maldonado walked to score a run and tie it at 1-1. Rodón was able to limit the damage by striking out Altuve to end the inning.	TRAINER’S ROOM	White Sox: INF/OF Leury García was out on Friday because of a sore knee. Manager Tony La Russa said he bruised it sliding recently and they’re trying to be careful with him. ... LF Andrew Vaughn sustained a bruise to his face when a ball bounced and hit him as he slid into second on a double in the sixth inning. He remained in the game before being replaced by Adam Engel for the bottom of the eighth. La Russa said Vaughn was having trouble seeing clearly and was icing his face after the game.	HOME SWEET HOME	Garcia has been great at home this season, posting a 2.05 ERA with 39 strikeouts in six starts. He leads American League rookies with a 2.82 ERA overall this season.	UP NEXT	Houston’s Framber Valdez (3-0, 1.42 ERA) opposes Lance Lynn (7-2, 1.51) when the series continues Saturday night.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DENVER -- — C.J. Cron hit a game-ending single in the 10th inning and the Colorado Rockies beat the Milwaukee Brewers 6-5 Friday night to extend their winning streak to a season-high five.	All five wins have come in the thin air of mile-high Coors Field, where the Rockies are 25-14 and batting a major league-high .281. Colorado is a major league-worst 5-27 on the road and hitting a big league-low .200. They completed their seventh win in their final at-bat, tops in the majors.	“I think we play good baseball here,” Cron said. “Our offense has done a good job putting up runs, our starters have done a great job getting deep into the game, our bullpen has been lights out. (Daniel Bard) kind of gave up that one. We wanted to get it right back for him and it was a really good win for everybody all the way around."	With Ryan McMahon starting the 10th on second, Cron singled off Devin Williams (2-1).	“He’s one of the best in the game,” Cron said of Williams. “He’s got a fastball and changeup pretty much but that changeup is really good. He got me with it a couple of times. Once I saw it a few times, I was able to lay off it. I gained a little bit of confidence that I could hit either the heater or the changeup and he moved to the fastball away."	Jhoulys Chacin (1-1) pitched a scoreless 10th, helped by center fielder Garrett Hampson’s diving catch of Christian Yelich’s sinking liner starting the inning. Chacin closed the inning with a pair of strikeouts.	Milwaukee has lost five in a row after winning 14 of 16, and the Brewers have lost seven straight to the Rockies, matching their most against Colorado.	The Brewers hit into four double plays and went 2 for 12 with runners in scoring position.	Luis Urías homered for Milwaukee.	Colorado trailed 4-1 deficit before Trevor Story's sacrifice fly in the fifth. Pinch-hitter Yonathan Daza chased starter Corbin Burnes with an RBI double in the sixth and scored on Hampson's double off Brent Suter, and Brendan Rodgers' second double of the game gave Colorado a 5-4 lead against Brad Boxberger in the seventh.	Narváez and Willy Adames hit successive doubles in the ninth off Bard, who blew a save for the fourth time in 13 chances.	Kolten Wong led off for Milwaukee and went 1 for 5 in his first game since June 3 after missing time while on the injured list with a left oblique strain.	“That's one of the better defensive games I’ve seen here,” Burnes said. “Wong made a couple of great plays. ... Yelich made a good play in left, Avi (Garcia) in right. The defense was there. It’s straight up on me tonight. I just couldn’t get the pitches down in the zone, couldn’t get the punchouts when they had two strikes. Obviously, it’s a tough pill to swallow, losing that game.”	Burnes went 5 1/3 innings and allowed four runs on eight hits.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Brewers: RHP Zack Godley's contract was selected from Triple-A Nashville. INF/OF Pablo Reyes and RHP Eric Yardley were optioned to Nashville and INF Jake Hager was designated for assignment.	UP NEXT	Brewers: RHP Adrian Houser (4-5, 3.62 ERA) is slated to start Saturday night in the third of a four-game set with the Rockies.	Rockies: LHP Austin Gomber (6-5, 3.54 ERA) has emerged as a cornerstone of the Rockies’ rotation since his acquisition from the Cardinals as part of the trade that sent Nolan Arenado to St. Louis. He has not allowed an earned run in his last 23 1/3 innings at Coors Field, the second longest such streak ever at the hitter friendly park.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- — Shohei Ohtani celebrated his appointment to next month's All-Star Home Run Derby in fitting style, connecting twice during the Los Angeles Angels' 11-3 win over the Detroit Tigers on Friday night.	Ohtani clubbed his 20th and 21st homers of the season hours after announcing he would take part in MLB’s annual home-run spectacle July 12 at Coors Field in Denver.	The first blast from Ohtani was a line drive to right field that was part of the Angels’ three-homer fifth inning. His second went the opposite way to left-center field in the eighth, helping bring the team back to the .500 mark at 35-35.	“The first one was like 15 feet off the ground and the second one was a great spot for him,” Angels manager Joe Maddon said. “When he's hitting the ball like that to left-center, you know he's got his A-hack going on. Wonderful to watch.”	Luis Rengifo and Jared Walsh also homered in the fifth, with Rengifo’s first of the season coming in his second game since he returned from Triple-A. Walsh, who has taken over as the Angels’ everyday first baseman following the early-May departure of Albert Pujols, hit his 16th.	Tigers starter Jose Urena (2-7) was rocked for seven runs on seven hits with three walks over 4 1/3 innings. It was the second-consecutive start Urena gave up seven earned runs, also doing it Saturday against the Chicago White Sox.	“(Urena) was OK in the beginning but he hasn't been able to sustain it throughout and they put some really good swings on him,” Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said. “They beat us in every facet. It wasn't all Jose Urena. I know he gave up some damage in his last inning but ... obviously back to the drawing board for him.”	This was the second game the Angels were at full capacity this season, with a crowd of just 22,734 announced.	The second Ohtani homer of the game came off Tigers right-hander Joe Jimenez and gave him his fourth career multihomer game and his first this season. He entered Friday three back of the the major league lead held by the Toronto Blue Jays' Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and the San Diego Padres' Fernando Tatis Jr.	“(Ohtani) hit a ball to the pull side, he hit a ball oppo,” Hinch said. “He's a very dynamic hitter. It's very must-see TV type."	Only four Angels players have ever hit 20 home runs with 10 stolen bases before the All-Star break, with Ohtani now joining Mike Trout (2014, 2018), Troy Glaus (2000) and Don Baylor (1978-79).	Ohtani did not speak to reporters afterward.	Angels starter Alex Cobb (5-2) gave up one run on three hits over 5 2/3 inning with two walks and eight strikeouts. The run was not earned. Cobb’s outing came after he gave up five runs in consecutive starts against the Arizona Diamondbacks and Seattle Mariners.	The Angels received an RBI single from Kean Wong in the second inning and a run-scoring double from Taylor Ward in the third to take a 2-0 lead, before Rengifo, Ohtani and Walsh all went deep in the fifth for a 7-0 lead.	The Tigers finally broke through off Cobb in the sixth inning when Miguel Cabrera hit an RBI double off the right-field wall. Cabrera, who has 492 career home runs, just missed tying Lou Gehrig and Fred McGriff for 28th on the career list.	Ward added a two-run double in a three-run sixth inning as the Angels took a 10-1 lead, while the Tigers’ Willi Castro had an RBI single in the seventh off Angels right-hander Chris Rodriguez. The Tigers scored their final run on a Robbie Grossman ground out in the ninth.	“That's what we're looking for,” Maddon said of the Angels' overall offensive approach. “Of course you love the home run. Everybody does. But you also love the ball being moved and action on the bases and everything we're clamoring for in a real baseball game again. Up and down, guys hit the ball well.”	TRAINERS’ ROOM	Tigers: LHP Matthew Boyd was diagnosed with muscular tendonitis, according to manager A.J. Hinch, after an examination by elbow specialist Dr. Neal ElAttrache in Los Angeles. Boyd will be out at least through the All-Star break before the team works on a timetable for his return. ... SS Niko Goodrum left the game in the sixth inning with a finger sprain on his left hand.	Angels: 3B Anthony Rendon has made some progress with a triceps injury, but he was out for a fourth consecutive game after manager Joe Maddon delayed announcing his starting lineup to get a late update on his infielder’s status.	UP NEXT	After earning his first career victory as a starter in 20 tries Sunday at Arizona, LHP Patrick Sandoval (1-2, 3.51 ERA) starts for the Angels on Saturday against the Tigers. RHP Wily Peralta (0-0, 0.00) will make his second appearance for Detroit and his first start since 2017 with the Milwaukee Brewers.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PHOENIX -- — The Diamondbacks stumbled to their franchise-record 15th straight loss, with Steven Souza Jr. hitting a go-ahead home run in his return to Arizona following a horrific knee injury and helping the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 3-0 victory Friday night.	Arizona broke the team mark of 14 straight losses from July 9-25, 2004, and lost for the 38th time in 43 games. They have the worst record in the major leagues at 20-51, and set a major-league record with their 23rd straight road loss Thursday.	“We have to find a way to get out of it,” manager Torey Lovullo said. "It's time to find a way.”	Souza homered in the eighth off Arizona reliever Joe Mantiply (0-2). Souza slipped on home plate and tore his left ACL while playing for the Diamondbacks in an exhibition game against the Chicago White Sox on March 25, 2019. Souza did not return until the 2020 regular season.	“The last time I touched home plate didn't end well for me,” Souza said. “Being able to touch it and walk away being up 1-0 was definitely emotional.”	Trevor Bauer (7-5), in the best of his three starts since word began to spread that Major League Baseball would begin cracking down on pitchers' use of illicit sticky stuff, pitched three-hit ball over seven innings. He struck out eight and walked three, lowering his ERA to 2.45.	Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said Bauer's tempo was better than it had been his previous two starts.	“Just get the ball, get on the mound and keep things moving,” Bauer said. “I thought it would benefit me in my command and also help guys not stand out there for an extended period of time.”	Jimmy Nelson and Kenley Jansen each pitched an inning to finish a three-hitter, with Jansen getting his 17th save in 19 chances and finishing the Dodgers' sixth shutout.	Arizona was blanked for the ninth time.	Dodgers center fielder Mookie Betts added a sacrifice fly in the eighth, scoring shortstop Gavin Lux, who had walked and gone to third on a pinch-hit double by Andy Burns. Arizona reliever Stefan Crichton then balked in a run.	Bauer escaped a bases-loaded jam in the fourth when Carson Kelly hit an inning-ending flyout. Eduardo Escobar hit an inning-ending popout that stranded two runners in the fifth, starting a string in which the Diamondbacks' last 13 batters were retired in order.	Souza helped Bauer get through the seventh with a sliding catch into foul territory in right field to retire Nick Ahmed.	Diamondbacks starter Caleb Smith allowed one run in six innings with four walks and five strikeouts.	ROSTER MOVE	Diamondbacks: Arizona designated P Keury Mella for assignment and selected the contract of reliever Noé Ramirez from Triple-A Reno. Mella had a 32.40 ERA in two appearances with the Diamondbacks. Ramirez had an 8.00 ERA in eight appearances at Reno.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: OF Cody Bellinger (hamstring) ran the bases Wednesday and Roberts said, “he responded really well.” Roberts said Bellinger should be activated off the injured list for the series against San Diego beginning Monday. ... 1B Max Muncy (oblique) will not need a rehabilitation assignment and could be ready for the second or third game of the Padres series ... SS Corey Seager (hand) could start a rehab assignment next week. ... Roberts said he hopes LHP Scott Alexander (shoulder inflammation) will be ready to rejoin the Dodgers by early July	Diamondbacks: LHP Madison Bumgarner (shoulder) threw off flat ground Friday and is scheduled to pitch a bullpen session Tuesday. ... RHP Taylor Widener (groin) threw a 31-pitch bullpen Friday. ... RHP Tyler Clippard (knee) threw 15 pitches off flat ground and 10 off a mound . ... OF Kole Calhoun took batting practice.	UP NEXT	Los Angeles Dodgers ace Walker Buehler is 6-0 with a 2.38 ERA in 13 starts this season going into his outing at the Arizona Diamondbacks and Brad Peacock (2-4, 5.26). Buehler is 2-0 with a 2.47 ERA in nine starts against Arizona, including seven scoreless innings during a May 17 win at Dodger Stadium in which the only hit he allowed a one-out single in the first to Josh Rojas.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

SAN FRANCISCO -- — Johnny Cueto struck out five in six uneven innings, Brandon Belt homered and the San Francisco Giants beat the Philadelphia Phillies 5-3 on Friday night.	LaMonte Wade Jr. doubled, tripled and drove in two runs as the Giants won in manager Gabe Kapler’s first home game against his former team. Kapler was fired in 2019 after two seasons as the Phillies’ manager.	San Francisco has won five straight, 17 of 23 and is a majors-best 45-25.	“I feel that we’re more united, that we’re getting along better, and that we’re enjoying ourselves,” Cueto said through an interpreter. “We’re winning. I just hope that we continue winning so we can have more happy days.”	Andrew McCutchen hit his 12th home run for the Phillies. Odúbel Herrera connected for his fifth, a solo shot leading off the game. Bryce Harper had two hits in his return to Philadelphia’s lineup after leaving Wednesday’s game against the Dodgers with lower back tightness.	Cueto (5-3) settled down to beat the Phillies for the second time in 13 career starts after giving up Hererra’s home run on the fourth pitch of the game. Cueto allowed three runs on six hits.	“He made several quality pitches that they put good swings on,” Kapler said. “He was able to go six innings in large part because his defense played good behind him. He pitched to contact and he doesn’t walk guys.”	An All-Star for the Giants in 2016, Cueto also walked and scored the tie-breaking run on Wade’s triple in the fourth.	“When I saw the ball come off the bat I told myself I have to score from first,” Cueto said. “I felt stronger after running the bases. I work hard at it.”	Dominic Leone and Tyler Rogers retired three batters apiece. Jake McGee pitched the ninth for his 14th save.	Phillies starter Vince Velasquez (2-2) allowed four runs, three earned, and walked four in four innings. Velasquez is winless over his last four starts.	Having four walks under my belt is unnecessary,” Velasquez said. “I have to do a better job attacking the zone. It seemed like I was all over the place.”	SORRY ABOUT THAT	The Phillies threw the ball around like a Little League team in the second inning, but it was a defensive breakdown in the first that stood out. San Francisco’s Buster Posey hit a high foul ball down the right field line that first baseman Rhys Hoskins and second baseman Brad Miller tried to chase down. Hoskins was in position to make the catch when Miller stumbled and bumped into him from behind, just before the ball landed on the ground. No error was charged, although Posey drew a walk.	“You can’t make the little mistakes, they’re going to haunt you,” said Harper of the Phillies defense. “We can’t give them outs. You get 27 of them and we’re giving them a couple more. We need be better tomorrow and make less mistakes.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Phillies: Catcher Andrew Knapp was placed in concussion protocol after coming out of the game when he took a hard foul ball off the facemask in the sixth. Knapp dropped to the ground and stayed on his knees for several moments as manager Joe Girardi and a team trainer came out. Knapp finished the inning before being replaced by J.T. Realmuto.	Giants: INF Darin Ruf (strained right hamstring) ran the bases before the game and may begin a rehab assignment this weekend. 2B Tommy La Stella (strained left hamstring) also ran the bases and is close to beginning a rehab assignment. … Kapler said the Giants are unsure whether to activate OF Alex Dickerson (upper back tightness) off the IL to rejoin the team or send him on a rehab assignment. … RHP Aaron Sanchez was pulled from a rehab start with Triple-A Sacramento due to a blister on his right middle finger.	UP NEXT	Giants LHP Alex Wood (6-3, 3.71 ERA) faces Philadelphia on Saturday and will try to end a rough patch. Wood has allowed 13 earned runs in 15 innings over his previous three starts. Phillies RHP Aaron Nola (5-4, 3.69) has one win in four career starts against San Francisco.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN DIEGO -- — Wil Myers made up for lost time with two impressive swings.	After struggling for weeks, Myers homered twice and doubled to lead the San Diego Padres to an 8-2 win against the Cincinnati Reds on Friday night. Tommy Pham hit a leadoff homer and Chris Paddack struck out 11 in five impressive innings to match his career high.	The Padres have hit seven homers in winning the first two games of the four-game series. They came into the series struggling badly after losing 13 of 17 games, including going just 1-5 on a trip through New York and Colorado.	Coming off a 6-4 thriller Thursday night in which they hit four homers in the final four innings, including a pair of two-run homers in the ninth, the Padres didn't wait that long to break out on Friday night. Pham hit an opposite-field shot to right on rookie Tony Santillan's second pitch, his sixth.	Myers homered off the first floor of the Western Metal Supply Co. Building in the left-field corner leading off the second, giving him the most homers by a Padres player at Petco Park, 58. He had been tied with Adrian Gonzalez at 57.	“I've been trying to do that for like a month now. I finally got it. Pretty cool to have. It's definitely a record that I don't think will every be broken, so that's nice," he cracked.	Myers' 59th homer at the downtown ballpark was a leadoff shot off reliever Ashton Goudeau into the Padres' bullpen in the fourth for a 4-1 lead.	It was his ninth career multihomer game and first since Game 2 of the 2020 wild-card series against the St. Louis Cardinals. He has eight homers this season.	He hadn't homered since May 30 at Houston. He hadn't homered at home since April 7 against San Francisco.	Myers missed 10 games in May after testing positive for COVID-19.	“Especially since I've been back from COVID, I've struggled a little bit to find some things, but today was nice,” Myers said. “I was able to not miss pitches over the zone and put them in play, which is the thing I've been working on most. I felt great tonight. Those are some of those games that can really get you going."	Goudeau loaded the bases with one out in the fourth and Fernando Tatis Jr. hit an RBI single to left.	Tatis hit a leadoff double in the third and eventually scored on Manny Machado's sacrifice fly.	Trent Grisham had a two-run double in the eighth.	Paddack (4-5) was mostly brilliant in holding the Reds to two runs and six hits, with just one walk. He matched his career strikeout high set against the New York Mets on May 6, 2019, in his seventh big league start.	Paddack has been up and down since his impressive rookie season of 2019.	“I'll continue to build. I’m not going to let my guard down," Paddack said. “I’ve had success in the big leagues before and I know that this game will humble you quickly. I'm just going to, every fifth, sixth day, grab the ball and go out there and attack and have fun."	Paddack allowed Jesse Winker's RBI single in the third and Kyle Farmer's RBI base hit in the fourth.	The damage could have been worse in the fourth. Paddack walked Joey Votto and allowed Eugenio Suárez's infield single with one out. The tall right-hander leaped over Tatis, the shortstop, to avoid a collision as they both went for Suárez’s grounder. Paddack struck out Tucker Barnhart, allowed Farmer's run-scoring single and then struck out pinch-hitter Shogo Akiyama.	The Reds struck out 15 times, with Paddack setting the tone.	“From where I'm sitting in the dugout, the stuff that really the last two guys had against us was pretty impressive," manager David Bell said. “Tonight he was really good. You've got to give him credit. I think that was a big part of tonight."	Joe Musgrove pitched seven strong innings Thursday night but didn't get the decision.	Santillan (0-1) allowed three runs and four hits in three innings, struck out three and walked one.	UMPIRE CHANGE	Plate umpire Larry Vanover took a foul ball by Winker off his mask in the top of the first inning and removed himself after the bottom of the inning. During a 13-minute delay while Chris Guccione changed into his protective gear to move behind the plate, the Padres' infielders came off the field and Tatis and South Korean rookie Kim Ha-seong led a dance-off to Psy's “Gangnam Style."	UP NEXT	RHP Vladimir Gutierrez (3-1, 2.74) of the Reds is scheduled to start Saturday night in the third game of the four-game series. He will be making his fifth big league appearance and has won three straight starts. The Padres didn't plan to announce their starter until after Friday night's game.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

SEATTLE -- — Yusei Kikuchi threw four-hit ball over seven innings, Seattle batted around during a four-run first inning and the Mariners beat the Tampa Bay Rays 5-1 on Friday night.	Kikuchi (4-3) earned his 10th quality start in 12 appearances while sending the Rays to their fourth straight loss, matching their season high.	Asked if he thinks Kikuchi has earned All-Star consideration, Mariners manager Scott Servais said: “I think it's a great question and I think it's something we should talk about. I think he's one of the top five left-handers in the game.”	The Japanese pitcher struck out six and recorded 13 infield outs as he helped the Mariners to their fifth win in six games. He’s given up seven hits and one run with 12 strikeouts over 14 innings in his last two starts.	“From the side, it looked like he got better as the game went by,” Rays manager Kevin Cash said. “His fastball velocity spiked in the sixth and seventh innings.”	Kikuchi struggled in the first inning, allowing two hits, including Yandy Diaz’s RBI single that made it 1-0. But he retired 11 of 12 batters starting in the second inning and got out of the third inning on eight pitches and the fourth in 10, thanks to strong play from Gold Glove shortstop J.P. Crawford.	“I get fired up every time he makes an amazing play,” Kikuchi said through a translator, adding: “J.P. and my teammates made a lot of great plays and that allowed me to get into a rhythm. It made it really easy to pitch out there.”	Kendall Graveman and Drew Steckenrider each pitched an inning of relief with a strikeout apiece.	The Mariners batted around in the first against Michael Wacha (1-2), scoring four runs on six hits with RBI from Kyle Seager, Jake Bauers, Shed Long Jr. and Luis Torrens, who added another RBI single in the third to make it 5-1.	“Man, that first inning was cool,” said Crawford, who led off with a double.	Wacha gave up 11 hits in 3 2/3 innings, his longest stint since returning from the injured list May 23.	Seattle repeatedly beat the shift against Tampa Bay, sending nine hits to the opposite field.	“We probably got beat around by the shift about as much as I can recall in a long time,” Cash said.	EXTRA-BASE STREAK	With a double in the third inning, Ty France extended his streak to five straight games with an extra-base hit, a team season-high. The DH/INF had three hits in the first four innings, scoring two runs.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Rays: RHP Tyler Glasnow (right elbow strain) had an encouraging meeting with a specialist in Dallas on Friday and won’t need surgery. Glasnow, who was moved to the 60-day injured list Thursday, will be shut down for four to six weeks. The hope is he might be able to return four weeks after that, perhaps for a postseason run, but manager Kevin Cash said he was not ready to predict a late return for Glasnow.	Mariners: Seattle sent RHP Justin Dunn (right shoulder soreness) to the 10-day injured list for the second time this month and moved CF Kyle Lewis (knee) to the 60-day injured list. Dunn had an MRI on Friday after pulling himself two innings into his start on Thursday, but results weren’t available. Lewis recently had surgery to repair the meniscus in his right knee, and manager Scott Servais said recovery time made the move necessary.	UP NEXT	Rays: LHP Josh Fleming (6-4, 3.20) recorded his team-record 11th win in his first 18 career appearances in his last game, a 4 2/3-innings relief appearance behind an opener.	Mariners: Rookie RHP Logan Gilbert (2-2, 4.13) goes for his third straight win.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

NEW YORK -- — Six innings after a shard of his broken bat hit Gio Urshela in the right eye, he saw a fastball clearly enough to hit a go-ahead home run.	Urshela's eighth-inning drive off Jesus Luzardo landed in the netting above Monument Park beyond center field and helped the New York Yankees rally from a three-run deficit in a 7-5 victory Saturday that stopped the Oakland Athletics’ seven-game winning streak.	Urshela’s bat splinted as he grounded into a double play in the second inning.	“Obviously, a scary moment there, but they got with him underneath, whether it was drops or whatever, and got the little fraying (out),” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. "Obviously, one of those scary situations initially. But he was OK.”	Urshela jogged to first.	“I saw just the piece of wood coming to my eyes," he said. ”I don’t even see the ball and I don’t even see where I was running. Just my eyes started feeling like a little pain, but thank God, I’m good.”	Urshela's presence turned the game.	He singled in New York’s first run in the fourth and put the Yankees ahead 5-4 when he turned on a 98.6 mph fastball from Luzardo (2-4). DJ LeMahieu added a two-run single against Sergio Romo.	“Luzardo’s a pitcher who throws really hard,” Urshela said. “So I’m trying to stay short and trying to swing (at) a ball in the zone.”	Of Urshela's 36 homers since he joined the Yankees in April 2019, 16 have tied a game or provided a lead.	“Gio’s always been a guy, certainly since we had him that in the biggest spots, you love him up there and you love the ball hit to him," Boone said. “I think it’s a really good player that’s confident in his ability.”	Aroldis Chapman struck out Matt Chapman on a 103.4 mph pitch to strand two runners in the ninth. His final pitch was Chapman’s fastest on a strikeout since the 2017 AL wild card game and the fastest on a strikeout of any big league pitcher since Jordan Hicks of St. Louis reached 104.1 mph on April 21, 2019, according to MLB Statcast.	“Chapman to Chapman, it was a really explosive matchup,” Oakland shortstop Elvis Andrus said. “He was throwing 103. It’s not that easy to hit that one.”	Oakland had built a 4-1 lead off Domingo Germán on solo homers by Tony Kemp and Matt Chapman, and Matt Olson’s two-run single in the fifth.	Chris Bassitt had New York largely in check. The first sign he lost composure was in the fifth, when he allowed Clint Frazier’s leadoff double and slammed his glove into the bench several times at the end of the inning.	Gary Sánchez homered in the sixth, his 11th this season and fifth in nine games, and New York tied it 4-4 in the seventh against Burch Smith when Frazier doubled again, and Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton hit RBI singles.	Nestor Cortes Jr. escaped a first-and-third, no-outs jam in the fifth and pitched three innings of one-hit relief.	Chad Green (2-4) struck out the side in the eighth, and Aroldis Chapman gave up an RBI single to Ramón Laureano before getting his 15th save in 17 chances.	Boone was ejected for arguing a pitch on a one-out walk to Mark Canha in the ninth.	New York stopped a six-game home losing streak and got its seventh win when trailing in the seventh inning or later, tied for the major league lead.	“That was a really exciting game,” Urshela said.	Oakland dropped to 34-3 when leading after seven innings and lost for only the third time in 16 games in June.	“We were playing a really good offensive team,” Andrus said. “Our bullpen are human beings, too. They’re going to get hit once in a while.”	Bassitt gave up two runs and six hits in six innings. He is 6-0 is in his last 13 starts.	German allowed four runs and seven hits in four-plus innings.	Kemp homered for the second straight game.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Athletics: OF Stephen Piscotty (strained left wrist) was placed on the 10-day injured list and will see a specialist in Arizona.	Yankees: 1B Luke Voit (strained oblique) will be activated Tuesday. ... RHP Luis Severino, who exited a rehab start last Saturday with a groin injury, threw from 60 feet in the outfield. Severino is rehabbing from undergoing Tommy John surgery on Feb. 27 last year. ... RHP Darren O’Day (strained right rotator cuff) threw a bullpen session and could start a rehab assignment next week.	UP NEXT	Oakland: LHP Sean Manaea (6-2, 2.99 ERA), who is 3-0 with an 0.84 ERA in his last five starts, opposes New York LHP Jordan Montgomery (3-1, 4.20) Sunday.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

WASHINGTON -- — Francisco Lindor had five RBI on a pair of two-run homers and run-scoring single for his first big offensive game with the New York Mets, a 5-1 victory over the Washington Nationals on Saturday in the opener of a day-night doubleheader.	Lindor homered in the first on a sinker from Joe Ross (3-7), singled in the third on a changeup for a 3-0 lead and homered into the second deck in the fifth on a slider for his 12th multi-homer game. The five RBI were his most since his career-high seven for the Indians on July 2, 2018, at Kansas City.	“I think the first one gave me more satisfaction because it showed the work that I am doing is working,” Lindor said.	Cleveland traded Lindor to the Mets in January, and New York signed the 27-year-old to contracts worth $363.2 million over 11 seasons. Lindor, who had not driven in more than two runs in a game this season, is hitting .218 with eight homers and 21 RBI.	“Once again, I’m just glad he’s trusting his power,” Mets manager Luis Rojas said. “He can create power and he doesn’t need to only pull the ball.”	New York opened a seven-game lead over fourth-place Washington in the NL East and stopped the Nationals' season-high, five-game winning streak.	David Peterson threw a season-high 94 pitches but fell short of qualifying for the win, allowing one run and two hits in 4 2/3 innings.	Rojas removed Peterson after Trea Turner's two-out double in the fifth, and Aaron Loup (2-0) allowed Juan Soto's RBI single. Josh Bell walked, and Loup struck out Josh Harrison on three pitches.	Miguel Castro and Seth Lugo combined to pitch the sixth, and Trevor May finished a four-hitter in a seven-inning game under pandemic rules.	Ross (3-7) allowed five runs and six hits in five innings. He was coming off consecutive starts without allowing an earned run.	“I just got beat by one guy,” Ross said. “It is what it is.”	Peterson scored New York's first run after he was hit by a pitch and also doubled leading off the fifth for his first big league hit.	“I feel like a full baseball player today,” Peterson said.	Left-hander Jon Lester (0-2, 4.09 ERA) was to start the second game for the Nationals and Robert Gsellman (0-0, 3.65) for the Mets.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Nationals: RHP Max Scherzer (right groin) threw a bullpen session Saturday. Scherzer (5-4, 2.21 ERA) pitched just one-third of an inning in his June 11 start.	Mets: RHP Jacob deGrom (right shoulder) threw a full bullpen session on his 33rd birthday and is on track to start one of the the games in Monday's doubleheader against Atlanta. Rojas said deGrom felt normal during a 20-pitch session. DeGrom (6-2, 0.54) left his Wednesday start after three innings because of right shoulder soreness. ... LHP Joey Lucchesi was put on the 10-day IL with left elbow inflammation, a day after pitching 5 1/3 scoreless innings. ... OF Albert Allmora Jr. was activated from the 10-day IL and started the second game. He had been sidelined since May 11, when he bruised his left shoulder charging into an outfield wall.	UP NEXT	LHP Patrick Corbin (4-5, 5.60) starts Sunday's series finale for the Nationals and RHP Taijuan Walker (6-2, 2.12) for the Mets.	------	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

CHICAGO -- — Adam Duvall is open to participating in the Home Run Derby if Major League Baseball wants him. The way he's knocking them out, he's making a case to be included.	Duvall homered twice for the second straight game, Pablo López pitched one-hit ball over seven innings and the Miami Marlins pounded the Chicago Cubs 11-1 on Saturday.	The Marlins have outscored the NL Central leaders 21-3 through the first two games and put themselves in position to sweep their first series since winning both wild-card games against Chicago last fall.	“What we showed today is, from a whole, what we strive for every day," Duvall said. “Being tough outs, tough at-bats, putting the barrel to the ball, driving the baseball, hitting the ball in the gap, hitting the ball over the fence.”	No one's been a tougher out the past two games than Duvall.	He remained locked in after hitting a grand slam and two-run drive in Friday’s 10-2 romp, hitting two-run shots in the first and third against Jake Arrieta (5-8). Duvall joined Derrek Lee in 2002 and Giancarlo Stanton in 2016 as the only Marlins with back-to-back multi-homer games.	“I've had some pretty good stretches in my career,” said Duvall, an All-Star with Cincinnati in 2016. “Obviously, the swing and the bat's coming through the zone the right way right now. But it's a combination of getting good pitches to hit and then having that swing to match.”	Jesús Sánchez added his first big league homer, and Lewin Díaz went deep.	The only hit López (3-4) allowed was a single to shallow left by Eric Sogard in the second inning. The right-hander struck out seven and walked none with his late dad on his mind. Father's Day on Sunday will be the first since Danny López died last July.	“This game today had a lot of meaning for me, with Father's Day coming tomorrow,” he said. “I just hope he's as happy as I am with how everything went today.”	Chicago’s Jason Heyward hit a solo homer in the eighth against Anthony Bass.	DUVALL GOES DEEP	Duvall made it 3-0 in the first when he followed Jesús Aguilar’s RBI groundout with a two-run shot, driving an 0-2 sinker the opposite way to right.	The Marlins added a run in the second when Jorge Alfaro singled and scored on Jon Berti's sacrifice fly.	Duvall extended the lead to 6-0 in the third with another two-run shot, launching one halfway up the bleachers in left-center for his 16th home run. That gave him three multi-homer games this season and 10 in his career.	ARRIETA STRUGGLES	Arrieta lasted just three innings, allowing six runs — four earned — and six hits. The 2015 NL Cy Young Award winner is 0-4 in with an 8.20 ERA in five starts since he beat Pittsburgh last month.	“The stuff was as good as it's been in a long time,” Arrieta said. “The first homer that Duvall hit, 0-2 pitch, it was actually a really nice sinker off the plate.”	Duvall's second homer, on a hanging 1-2 curve? That was a mistake.	“Not good enough, obviously,” Arrieta said. “Not what I intended to have happen today.”	The Cubs had not allowed 10 or more runs in back-to-back games at Wrigley Field since Aug. 18 and 19, 2015 against Detroit. They allowed one to score when a pop fly dropped between the mound and plate for a single and another on a wild pitch in losing for the fifth time in six games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: RHP Adbert Alzolay (blister on right middle finger) is scheduled to start Monday against Cleveland after being sidelined since June 7. “It's a big piece we've been missing,” manager David Ross said. “He's been one of the guys that have really given us ... consistent starting pitching, with real swing-and-miss. Has been a real asset to our rotation this year.” ... RHP Trevor Williams (appendectomy) threw a bullpen session Saturday and LHP Justin Steele (right hamstring strain) is scheduled to throw one on Sunday.	UP NEXT	The weekend series winds down, with RHP Alec Mills (2-1, 6.11 ERA) pitching for Chicago and rookie RHP Zach Thompson (1-1, 2.25) makes his third start for Miami. Mills lost to the New York Mets on Tuesday. Thompson went five scoreless innings in a win over Atlanta on June 12.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PITTSBURGH -- — Michael Perez and Bryan Reynolds hit three-run home runs during the seventh inning and the Pittsburgh Pirates rallied for a 6-3 victory over the Cleveland Indians on Saturday.	Perez homered to right off Bryan Shaw (1-2) to put the Pirates ahead. Four batters later, Reynolds hit a 98 mph fastball from James Karinchak that sailed over the stands in right, bounced into the Allegheny River and was measured at 428 feet.	Down 2-0 entering the seventh, the Pirates were aided by six walks, three each by Shaw and Karinchak. It is the most walks the Pirates have drawn in an inning since also coaxing six bases on balls in 1976 against the St. Louis Cardinals.	“The six walks give you so many opportunities to score, but I like them when they are mixed in with homers. I’ll take that,” Pittsburgh manager Derek Shelton said.	Perez’s home run was his fifth of the season in the backup catcher’s 27 games. Prior to this season, he had gone deep just twice in 84 games.	“Lately, I’ve been feeling great in the box,” said Perez, who was claimed off waivers from Tampa Bay in the offseason. “My mindset and mentality is to get a good at-bat, go into the box with a good plan and stay on top of the ball and hopefully execute the plan.”	Reynolds has a team-leading 12 homers. He has homered five times in 16 games in June while batting .345.	“I feel good up there,” Reynolds said. “I feel like the timing is good and all that good stuff. I’m just trying to keep it rolling and put the barrel on the ball consistently.”	Pittsburgh has won the first two games of the series after entering on a 10-game losing streak.	The Pirates rallied against two of the Indians’ best relievers.	“It’s uncharacteristic and it proves they’re human,” Cleveland manager Terry Francona said. “We ask a lot of them, and we’ll continue to because we think a lot of them. We hurt today but we’ll put it behind us and get them tomorrow.”	Home runs accounted for all the game’s scoring. Cleveland’s Harold Ramirez hit two solo shots, in the second and ninth innings, and Rene Rivera had a solo homer in the third.	It was Ramirez’s first career multihomer game.	The Indians had won four games in a row and six of seven prior to arriving in Pittsburgh.	Chris Stratton (2-0) pitched two scoreless relief innings for the win.	FOR STARTERS	Indians starter Cal Quantrill pitched five scoreless innings on short rest, allowing three hits. He walked two, struck out two and legged out an infield single.	“I though he pitched his heart out,” Francona said.	Pirates rookie Wil Crowe went 4 2/3 innings, giving up two runs and four hits while walking two and striking out two. He remains winless in 12 career starts.	FATHER’S DAY TREAT	Francona’s three daughters gave him a unique early Father’s Day present Saturday -- five boxes of hot dogs.	The hot dogs were from the Brighton Hot Dog Shoppe in New Brighton, Pa., a town 30 miles north of Pittsburgh where Francona grew up. A sizeable contingent of fans from New Brighton were on hand.	TRADE TALK	Pirates general manager Ben Cherington said the volume of phone calls from teams interested in making trades “feels like it has picked up a little bit” in recent days.	In last place in the NL Central, the Pirates will likely look to continue trading players for prospects as they did during the winter when they dealt RHP Joe Musgrove to San Diego, RHP Jameson Taillon to the New York Yankees and 1B Josh Bell to Washington.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Indians: 3B Jose Ramirez (bruised left foot) sat out a day after being hit by a pitch in the eighth inning and leaving the game. He is likely to play Sunday.	UP NEXT	It will be a matchup of rookies Sunday when Indians LHP Sam Hentges (1-1, 7.57) faces Pirates RHP JT Brubaker (4-5, 3.88). Hentges will be making his first start since May 30 after pitching in relief in his last three games. Brubaker allowed eight runs in eight innings in two starts against the Indians last season, though he did not factor in the decision in either game.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- — The Minnesota Twins are getting healthier and will take any break they can get as the two-time defending AL Central champions try to get out of last place in their division.	A twofer in Texas on Saturday could end up being a boost.	Max Kepler scored the go-ahead run on consecutive wild pitches in the seventh inning after the speedy Byron Buxton helped Minnesota get even earlier with an infield single in his first game since May 6, and the Twins beat the Rangers 3-2.	Former Texas slugger Nelson Cruz hit a tying two-run homer after Buxton reached in the fourth, his team-leading 15th of the season for Minnesota and the 432nd to pass Cal Ripken Jr. for 49th place.	A day after beating Texas 7-5 in 10 innings with help from back-to-back walks with the bases loaded, the Twins won their third consecutive game — one short of their longest winning streak this year — by taking the lead without getting a hit.	Kepler walked with one out in the seventh and took a base three times in a span of four pitches from reliever John King (5-5) with two outs and No. 9 hitter Luis Arraez at the plate, starting with a stolen base.	King's second wild pitch walked Arraez, but was close enough to his right elbow pad on the way to the backstop for Texas to challenge in the hope that a hit by pitch would send Kepler back to third. The walk was confirmed on review.	“Sometimes you need something like this to break your way,” Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. “We have someone on third base and put a little pressure on the other team, sometimes positive things happen. I'm glad it didn't touch that pad.”	Isiah Kiner-Falefa connected on a two-run shot for the Rangers in the third inning, his sixth of the season and first since May 2 as the Rangers lost the matchup of last-place teams for their 18th defeat in 21 games.	Buxton was the first to reach base against Texas starter Kolby Allard with one out in the fourth when he easily beat out a sharp grounder up the middle that sliding second baseman Nick Solak stopped. Cruz homered two pitches later.	Buxton hadn't played since the the last of three consecutive losses at home to Texas, when he strained his right hip. It was hard to tell he wasn't running full speed as quickly as Buxton got down the line, but Baldelli said he's under orders not to for the moment.	“I didn't want to go back on the bench, so I've got to do what he say,” said Buxton, who had been pushing hard to get back in the lineup and returned after homering twice in a three-game rehab stint at Triple-A St. Paul. “Whatever I've got to do to stay on the field and keep myself on the field.”	Caleb Thielbar (2-0) replaced Minnesota starter Randy Dobnak and pitched a perfect sixth with a strikeout. Alex Colomé matched Thielbar in the seventh.	Hansel Robles struck out Adolis García, the majors' rookie home run leader with 17, to strand two runners in the eighth, and Taylor Rogers struck out two in the ninth for his seventh save. García struck out three times.	King replaced Allard, who allowed two runs and struck out six in six innings. The left-hander didn't allow a hit in three innings, but the two walks and two wild pitches were enough for the Twins.	“I was just amped up and tried to do a little too much I think,” King said.	Dobnak, who had surrendered eight runs and four homers in 4 2/3 innings in his previous start against the New York Yankees, gave up two runs in five innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Twins: SS Andrelton Simmons (left ankle tightness) returned to the lineup after missing the series opener while 3B Josh Donaldson (right calf tightness) remained out. Both exited early in the game before the trip to Texas. Donaldson also has been dealing with an upper respiratory issue. “We’ll learn more about how JD is feeling physically and how his leg is doing as well, but we’ll figure that out later on,” manager Rocco Baldelli said.	UP NEXT	Twins RHP Kenta Maeda (2-2, 5.01 ERA) faces RHP Dane Dunning (2-5, 4.57) in a rematch of the Twins' 6-5 win on May 3, their only victory in a four-game series at home. Maeda, who got the win with 5 1/3 scoreless innings, is making his second start since returning from a right thigh strain that put him on the injured list. Dunning allowed three runs — two earned — in 5 2/3 innings in the first meeting.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

SAN FRANCISCO -- — Rhys Hoskins broke out a 2 for 40 slump with a pair of home runs and a career-best six RBI, leading the Philadelphia Phillies over the San Francisco Giants 13-6 on Saturday.	Ronald Torreyes also homered and drove in three runs as the Phillies won at San Francisco for the second time in nine games since 2018.	Bryce Harper doubled and scored. Alec Bohm had three of Philadelphia’s 16 hits and had two RBI.	“This type of game is always fun,” Hoskins said. “It seemed like everybody got in on the fun, too. I put some good swings on some balls today and barreled some up.”	Brandon Belt and Mike Yastrzemski homered for San Francisco. The were four lead changes in the first three innings before Philadelphia pulled away.	Torreyes broke a 6-all tie with a leadoff home run against Jarlin García (0-2) in the sixth.	Hoskins hit a two-run homer off Alex Wood in a the second, a 435-foot drive to left, had an RBI double in the sixth and a three-run homer against Coner Menez in the seventh, Hoskins’ 15th home run this season.	Hoskins has three multi-homer games this season after achieving the feat twice during a three-day stretch in April.	“We saw it at the end of our trip in LA, that his swing was back,” Phillies manager Joe Girardi said. “He was making solid contact all the time. He had a huge day for us. It was great. Any time you get a chance to come home,m it’s special.”	Hoskins grew up and played college ball about an hour north of San Francisco in Sacramento. He had a throng of family and friends, including his father and sister, watching from the stands.	“Every time we come back to the stadium it brings me back to being a kid and being a fan sitting in the seats,” Hoskins said.	Ranger Suárez (3-1) struck out three and retired eight batters.	Belt homered for the second consecutive day and became the second player in Giants history with 10 or more home runs into McCovey Cove, trailing only Barry Bonds’ 35.	“More than anything else we didn’t get as many big hits as they did,” Giants manager Gabe Kapler said. “As the game wore on they had higher quality at-bats than we did and that’s why they were able to keep scoring runs.”	Yastrzemski hit a two-run homer in the first off Aaron Nola, who allowed six runs, six hits and three walks in 2 1/3 innings.	Wood gave up six runs — four earned — six hits and two walks in three innings.	ROOKIE’S FIRST HIT	Phillies rookie Matt Vierling had a pinch-hit single in the sixth for his first career hit after having his contract purchased from Triple-A Lehigh Valley before the game. Vierling also stole second and scored on Hoskins’ double. In another move, C Rafael Marchan was brought up from the minors.	CELEBRATING JUNETEENTH	As part of their celebration honoring Juneteeth, the Giants wore replica uniforms of the San Francisco Sea Lions to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the team that played in the West Coast Negro Baseball Association league during the 1940s. During a pre-game ceremony, the family of Toni Stone – the first female known to play on a professional men’s baseball team when she played for the Sea Lions – was given a jersey honoring her legacy.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Phillies: C Andrew Knapp was placed on the seven-day concussion injured list after taking a foul ball off his facemask Friday. OF Matt Joyce was put on the 10-day IL with a lower back strain.	Giants: OF Alex Dickerson and INF Darin Ruf began rehab assignments with Triple-A Sacramento. “We’ll see how many at-bats they need to feel good and then we’ll gdt them out of there,” Kapler said. … C Buster Posey is expected to get a planned day off Sunday. … RHP Aaron Sanchez will pitch for Sacramento on Tuesday.

BALTIMORE -- — Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit his major-league leading 23rd homer and later capped Toronto’s ninth-inning rally with a go-ahead, two-run double, and the Blue Jays ended a five-game skid with a 10-7 victory Saturday over the Baltimore Orioles.	Marcus Semien homered twice for Toronto, which scored six runs with two outs in the ninth off relievers Paul Fry and Tyler Wells to stun the Orioles.	“Wins like this could get a team going, for sure,” Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said.	Ryan Mountcastle recorded his first career three-homer game and Cedric Mullins had his second consecutive multihomer game for Baltimore, which hit six homers in a game for the first time since doing so against Houston on Aug. 18, 2016.	Toronto starter Alek Manoah was ejected for hitting Maikel Franco after surrendering back-to-back blasts in the fourth inning and instigating a benches-clearing incident in which no punches were thrown.	Staked to a 7-4 lead to start the ninth, Fry (0-2) allowed two walks and two hits while recording two outs. Wells entered with the bases loaded and a 7-5 lead, but Bo Bichette blooped a two-run single to right to tie it.	“Sometimes you need some luck, and he put it in the perfect spot,” Semien said.	Guerrero then laced a double into the left-center gap to give the Blue Jays a 9-7 lead, and he scored on Randal Grichuk’s ensuing double.	“Give Bichette credit for an amazing at-bat,” Baltimore manager Brandon Hyde said. “He put the ball in play on a tough slider down and away after a bunch of foul balls, just out of our reach. It seemed it took a little bit of air out of the balloon for Wellsy. He hung a couple of pitches after that. It was a tough inning.”	Jordan Romano (4-1) pitched two scoreless innings for Toronto.	Manoah gave up a two-run shot to Mountcastle and a solo homer to DJ Stewart in the fourth to give Baltimore a 5-2 lead. He then plunked Franco on the first pitch, prompting the benches and bullpens to empty. Once the situation cooled down, the umpires conferred and ejected Manoah.	Manoah said he threw several sliders to Franco in an earlier at bat and shook off a sign for another, opting instead for a fastball. He said he was told by the umpires his ejection stemmed from “bad timing.”	“I tried to get that fastball in and it slipped away,” Manoah said. “I was confused by his reaction. I was questioning ‘What’s going on? What’s wrong?’ Those were my hand gestures as I was walking toward him. I didn’t understand the frustration there.”	Manoah allowed five runs in 3 1/3 innings, striking out six.	Baltimore starter Dean Kremer yielded solo shots to Semien and Guerrero in the first but no other damage over six innings, striking out six.	Mountcastle, who also had solo blasts in the second and sixth, is the first Oriole with three homers in a game since Pedro Severino did it at Texas on June 4, 2019. He became the second Orioles rookie with a three-homer game — Nick Markakis was the first, doing so Aug. 22, 2006, against Minnesota.	“Today I was seeing the ball well,” said Mountcastle, who matched a career high with four hits. “I was on everything. Obviously, it didn’t end the way we wanted it to, so I’m going to keep moving forward.”	Mullins had solo shots in the third and the seventh a day after going deep twice in the series opener against the Blue Jays.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Blue Jays: OF Lourdes Gurriel Jr. pinch hit in the seventh inning and remained in the game to play left a day after exiting for a pinch hitter in the ninth inning with a back injury.	Orioles: Hyde said he anticipates LHP John Means (shoulder strain) returning “right around” the All-Star break. Means, who left his June 5 start in the first inning and landed on the injured list the next day, has started to play catch.	DEAL	Toronto acquired RHP Jacob Barnes from the New York Mets for minor league RHP Troy Miller. Barnes was 1-1 with a 6.27 ERA and two saves in 19 appearances for New York before he was designated for assignment Monday. Montoyo said Barnes would likely join the Blue Jays on Tuesday in Miami.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays: LHP Hyun Jin Ryu (5-4, 3.43 ERA) is 1-0 with a 3.00 ERA in three career starts against Baltimore.	Orioles: RHP Matt Harvey (3-8, 7.76) will attempt to end an eight-start winless streak as the three-game series concludes. Harvey is 0-7 with a 12.00 ERA since May 7.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- — Light-hitting Bobby Dalbec had three RBI and was a double short of a cycle, J.D. Martinez hit a two-run homer and the Boston Red Sox beat the Kansas City Royals 7-1 on Saturday.	Dalbec, Boston's No. 9 hitter, singled in the second, put Boston ahead 2-1 in the fifth with his team-high third triple, was hit by a Jackson Kowar pitch in the seventh and hit a two-run homer in the ninth off Kowar.	Dalbec is 12 for 45 with four homers and 10 RBI in his last 12 games, raising his average to .214 and OPS to .699. He has nine homers and 32 RBI.	“We did a lot of good things today," Red Sox manager Alex Cora said. "We didn’t rely on the big guys today, so it was a good all-around win.”	Martín Pérez (5-4) allowed one run and three hits in five innings.	“Today I was attacking hitters well," Pérez said.	Garrett Whitlock, Hirokazu Sawamura and Brandon Workman combined for four innings of four-hit shutout relief.	Brad Keller (6-7) lost his third straight start, giving up five runs, five hits and three walks in five innings.	Kansas City went 0 for 11 with runners in scoring position and stranded eight runners.	“We had some good chances with the offense, but we just couldn’t get it done," Royals manager Mike Matheny said.	Kowar allowed two runs, three hits and two wild pitches in three innings, but the 24-year-old rookie right-hander cut his ERA from 36.00 to 18.00 in three big-league appearances.	Kansas City's Whit Merrifield stole three bases, raising his major league-leading total to 20. But after swiping third base in the third inning with the score 1-1, he got caught off third on Salvador Pérez's comebacker and easily was tagged out in a rundown for the second out.	Xander Bogaerts had a run-scoring single in the first, and Carlos Santana tied the score with an RBI grounder in the third.	Kiké Hernández walked leading off the fifth and scored the go-ahead run on Dalbec's triple. Danny Santana hit an RBI grounder, Alex Verdugo walked and Martinez made it 5-1 with his 14th homer.	UP NEXT	RHP Nathan Eovaldi (7-3, 3.76 ERA) will take the mound for Boston in Sunday's series finale against LHP Mike Minor (5-4, 4.63 ERA).	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

WASHINGTON -- — Jon Lester pitched shutout ball into the seventh inning to gain his first win for Washington, Kyle Schwarber backed him with four RBI on a pair of home runs and the Nationals beat the New York Mets 6-2 Saturday to split a day-night doubleheader.	Francisco Lindor had five RBI on a pair of two-run homers and run-scoring single for his first big offensive game with the Mets, who won the opener 5-1.	Lester, a 37-year-old left-hander, signed a $5 million, one-year contract with the Nationals after six seasons with the Chicago Cubs that included the team’s first World Series title in 108 years.	New York started an all right-hander batting order against Lester (1-2), who was within three outs of his first shutout in seven years before José Peraza hit a two-run homer in the seventh. Lester asked Nationals manager Davey Martinez to go back out for the seventh,.	“When he comes out of the game and looks at me, and says, ‘I want to finish it, I want the ball,’ when you have a veteran guy like that who has done what he has, you have to give him an opportunity,” Martinez said.	Lester gave up two runs and seven hits in six-plus innings with six strikeouts and no walks. He is 8-1 in his last 11 regular-season starts against the Mets, winning his last six decisions.	“That’s classic Jon,” Schwarber said.	Wander Suero allowed a pair of hits in the seventh, and Brad Hand retired James McCann on a first-pitch groundout for his 14th save in 16 chances.	Schwarber has 28 home runs in games started by Lester, his former Cubs teammate.	“Any time he hits a homer is great, but especially when I pitch it's really nice,” Lester said.	Schwarber led off the first with a home run off Robert Gsellman (0-1), who made his first start this season, and a three-run homer in the third off Sean Reid-Foley, who gave up five runs, five hits and four walks in 1 2/3 innings. Schwarber has 15 home runs this season.	Trea Turner homered in the third, his 11th this season but first since May 17.	In the opener, Lindor homered in the first on a sinker from Joe Ross (3-7), singled in the third on a changeup for a 3-0 lead and homered in the fifth on a slider for his 12th multi-homer game. The five RBI were his most since his career-high seven for the Indians on July 2, 2018, at Kansas City.	“I think the first one gave me more satisfaction because it showed the work that I am doing is working,” Lindor said.	Cleveland traded Lindor to the Mets in January, and New York signed the 27-year-old to contracts worth $363.2 million over 11 seasons. Lindor, who had not driven in more than two runs in a game this season, is hitting .218 with eight homers and 21 RBI.	“Once again, I’m just glad he’s trusting his power,” Mets manager Luis Rojas said. “He can create power and he doesn’t need to only pull the ball.”	Ross (3-7) allowed five runs and six hits in five innings. He was coming off consecutive starts without allowing an earned run.	“I just got beat by one guy,” Ross said. “It is what it is.”	SOTO DOUBLE DIPS	Juan Soto grounded into a 1-6-3 double play in the second. He has bounced into 11 double plays in 68 games this season, matching his career-high from the entire 2019 season.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Nationals: RHP Max Scherzer (right groin) threw a 40-pitch bullpen session Saturday and said he will be ready to pitch Tuesday in Philadelphia. Scherzer (5-4, 2.21 ERA) pitched just one-third of an inning in his June 11 start.	Mets: RHP Jacob deGrom (right shoulder) threw a full bullpen session on his 33rd birthday and is on track to start one of the the games in Monday’s doubleheader against Atlanta. Rojas said deGrom felt normal during a 20-pitch session. DeGrom (6-2, 0.54) left his Wednesday start after three innings because of right shoulder soreness. ... LHP Joey Lucchesi was put on the 10-day IL with left elbow inflammation, a day after pitching 5 1/3 scoreless innings, and will have an MRI. ... OF Albert Almora Jr. was activated from the 10-day IL to started the second game and doubled twice. He had been sidelined since May 11, when he bruised his left shoulder charging into an outfield wall.

HOUSTON -- — In the three games since Houston star third baseman Alex Bregman was injured, the two players filling in for him have come up big to help the Astros keep their winning streak alive.	Astros rookie Robel Garcia tied a career high with three RBI, Carlos Correa homered and Houston beat Lance Lynn and the Chicago White Sox 7-3 on Saturday night.	Framber Valdez (4-0) had another strong start to help the Astros to a sixth consecutive victory, tying their longest winning streak this season.	Garcia played third base on Saturday after Abraham Toro had for three hits and four RBI at the position in the first two games without Bregman, the runner-up for AL MVP in 2019.	“It’s huge and you really feel part of the team when you get to play and then you have success especially to help us win," manager Dusty Baker said. “We’re going to have to depend on them because we don’t have Bregman."	The Astros tagged Lynn (7-3), who entered with a 1.51 ERA, for eight hits and six runs — both season highs — in four innings in his shortest start of the season. Five of the runs were earned, which was also the most he’d permitted this season.	“When they get runs on base, they do a really good job of getting on top of every pitch," Lynn said. “They’re doing everything they can to make those scoring opportunities as good as they can be, so you’ve got to be better."	Valdez yielded six hits and three runs — two earned — in seven innings to extend his career-best streak by winning his sixth consecutive decision dating to last season.	Things went wrong for the White Sox almost immediately. Jose Altuve singled and advanced to second on an error by third baseman Yoán Moncada when he badly overthrew first base to start Houston’s first. A single by Yuli Gurriel with one out sent Altuve to third, and he scored on a wild pitch to make it 1-0.	There were two outs in the third when Adam Engel singled to right field. He scored when Moncada smacked a double to left field to tie it at 1-1.	Altuve got things going in the third on a double with one out. Brantley followed with an RBI single to put Houston on top 2-1.	There were two outs in the inning when Yordan Alvarez singled before Lynn walked Correa to load the bases.	Garcia sent a fastball from Lynn on a full count to the warning track in right field to clear the bases and extend the lead to 5-1.	Garcia is working hard to take advantage of his opportunity.	“We have some really good players and we’ve been able to pick up the slack and still play well," he said.	Houston added a run in the fourth inning on an RBI double by Brantley with two outs.	Andrew Vaughn hit a solo homer to start the seventh and get the White Sox within 6-2. Danny Mendick singled with one out in the inning and scored from second with two outs after a wild pitch by Valdez and an error by catcher Martín Maldonado.	Correa hit a solo homer in the eighth.	TRAINER’S ROOM	White Sox: Vaughn was back in the lineup a night after leaving when a ball bounced and hit him in the face as he was sliding into second base. Manager Tony La Russa said Vaughn was better on Saturday but that he’d likely end up with a black eye from the hit. ... RHP Jose Ruiz was going to be evaluated after leaving in the eighth inning with soreness in one of his knees.	Astros: Bregman, who was placed on the injured list with a strained left quadriceps on Thursday, said he was feeling better Saturday but that he isn’t sure how long he’ll be out. ... OF Kyle Tucker, who is on the injured list due to health and safety protocols, has been cleared to return to the team, but manager Dusty Baker said he probably won't be activated until Monday.	THEY SAID IT	La Russa on the series: “They’re not playing any harder than we are, they’re just playing better. I like the way we hung in there. We’re capable of turning it around."	UP NEXT	Chicago’s Dallas Keuchel (6-1, 3.78) will make his first career start against the Astros, where he played from 2012-2018, winning the AL Cy Young award in 2015. Keuchel will oppose Lance McCullers (3-1, 2.89), one of his closest friends from his time in Houston, as the Astros look to complete the four-game sweep.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

SAN DIEGO -- — The San Diego Padres didn't lose their swagger even though they lost their biggest star, shortstop Fernando Tatis Jr.	Three innings after Tatis walked off the field after reinjuring his left shoulder, his replacement, rookie Kim Ha-seong, sent Petco Park into a frenzy when he hit a two-run home run with two outs in the eighth inning to lead the Padres to a wild 7-5 win against the Cincinnati Reds.	As he approached the dugout following his trot, Kim called for Manny Machado to drape the “Swagg Chain” — a garish necklace used to celebrate big moments — around his neck. The South Korean then danced in the dugout to “Gangnam Style,” delighting the crowd even more.	Before the at-bat, fans were chanting, “Let's go Kim!”	“He was up there battling and then all of a sudden you start to hear the stadium, the fans, just chanting his name, and when he hit that ball the place just erupted,” manager Jayce Tingler said.	“If you panned into the dugout and just see the true happiness of his teammates, and just know how much this guy is loved and how hard he's worked to adjust to everything over here, so for him to have that moment I thought was huge.”	Kim, a 25-year-old former Korean Baseball Organization star who signed with the Padres in the offseason, said through a translator that he felt “pure joy. I was just enjoying the moment, I was so happy, that's about it. Nothing else, just happiness.”	Kim homered on a 1-2 pitch from Heath Hembree (1-2) to bring in Tommy Pham, aboard on a double. It was Kim’s fourth. Nabil Crismatt (2-1) got the win. Mark Melancon pitched the ninth for his big league-leading 20th save.	The wild day also included Reds star Joey Votto and manager David Bell getting ejected in a wild scene in the first inning.	The Padres will go for a four-game sweep Sunday. The Padres came into this series having lost 13 of 17, including being swept at lowly Colorado, while the Reds came in on a six-game winning streak.	Tatis left after diving to his right for Tyler Naquin’s single in the three-run fifth, when the Reds tied it at 5. Tatis extended his left arm as he landed and immediately reached for his shoulder, which he partially dislocated taking a violent swing against San Francisco on April 5. That injury landed him on the 10-day injured list.	Tatis was immediately checked by an athletic trainer as Tingler came out to make a pitching change. Tingler then checked on Tatis, who was looked to be in discomfort as he left the game.	Tingler said Tatis lobbied to stay in the game but the team wanted to be cautious. He said Tatis felt sore and is listed as day-to-day.	“We feel like we're in a fairly decent position,” Tingler said. “The trainers think it's nowhere near where it's been earlier on in the year."	The electrifying Tatis signed the longest contract in baseball history in February, for 14 years and $340 million.	“Is there a little bit of a gut punch when you lose Tati? Yeah, absolutely, people feel that,” Tingler said. "For us to continue to play, to stay in the game, to stay in the moment, we’re going to fight, we’re going to find a way to get it done. How appropriate was it Kim there taking over for Tatis and picking us up, I think it was huge for the team.”	Votto and Bell were ejected in the first inning. Catcher Webster Rivas appealed after Votto offered at the high, outside pitch from Miguel Díaz, and third base umpire Chris Guccione confirmed Votto went around.	Votto was unhappy and began arguing, and Bell came out of the dugout and joined the argument. Bell and coaches Delino DeShields and Freddie Benavides had to keep Votto away from plate umpire Ryan Additon, who then apparently ejected both player and manager, although Bell didn't realize it at the time.	Votto had to be restrained as he continued to argue. Shortly after Votto went to the dugout, a Padres fan seated near the visiting dugout was ejected. Bell went back to the dugout and said he was getting ready to resume managing the game when he was called back out and was told by the umpires that he was ejected, too.	“I just went out to try to keep Joey in the game. That was my goal," Bell said. “I didn't get the job done there.”	The Padres took a 5-2 lead when Machado hit a bases-loaded double into the left field corner with two outs in the fourth.	But the Reds tied it in the fifth, when they broke through against 28-year-old rookie Daniel Camarena after the local product had thrown two impressive innings in his big league debut.	Rookie Jonathan Indian and Jesse Winker opened the fifth with singles before Camarena got two outs. Tatis was hurt diving for Naquin's RBI single, which chased Camarena. James Norwood came on and walked Tyler Stephenson before Eugenio Suárez hit a two-run single to tie it.	The Reds took a 2-0 lead against Diaz on Winker's RBI double two batters into the game and Kyle Farmer's RBI double in the second.	Jake Cronenworth hit a tying, two-run homer in the third for the Padres, his eighth.	IMPRESSIVE DEBUT	Camarena, who went to San Diego’s Cathedral Catholic High, retired six of the first eight batters he faced. He retired the side in the third, including baseball’s two hottest hitters, Winker and Nick Castellanos. After putting runners on the corners with no outs in the fourth, he again retired the side.	UP NEXT	RHP Luis Castillo (2-9, 5.83) of the Reds and RHP Dinelson Lamet (1-2, 3.33) of the Padres are scheduled to start Sunday in the series finale.	------	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

DENVER -- — Willy Adames had four hits, including a go-ahead two-run home run in the top of the ninth inning, and the Milwaukee Brewers rallied to beat the Colorado Rockies 6-5 on Saturday night.	Adames also had three doubles and finished with three RBI for the Brewers, who snapped a five-game skid as well as a seven-game losing streak to the Rockies.	“It was a great, great night and the home run, it couldn’t be in a bigger spot and it was a tough spot,” Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. “He was down in the count, but as he did all night, he put a great swing on the ball in a spot where we sorely needed it.”	Raimel Tapia, Yonathan Daza, Trevor Story and Ryan McMahon each had two hits and Charlie Blackmon drove in two with groundouts for the Rockies, who saw their season-high five-game winning streak snapped. Tapia extended his hitting streak to 16 games, the longest active streak in the majors.	The Rockies turned to five relievers after losing starter Austin Gomber to injury early in the game.	Tyler Kinley (1-1) allowed a one-out single to Luis Urías before Adames drove a 1-2 offering over the right-center field fence into the Rockies bullpen for his ninth home run of the season.	“I knew I had it. I hit it pretty good,” Adames said. “It’s just that the fence here is so high, sometimes you second-guess yourself. But I knew I hit it good and it had a chance to go. ... I feel like we needed that. Hopefully, we keep going and finish the first half strong.”	Josh Hader pitched a scoreless ninth, striking out the final two batters he faced for his 18th save in 18 opportunities. Trevor Richards (2-0) worked a scoreless inning in relief for the victory.	Gomber allowed two runs on four hits and had one strikeout before leaving due to left forearm tightness after pitching two innings. Both of the runs scored in the first inning, bringing an end to his streak of 23 1/3 innings without allowing an earned run at Coors Field.	“He felt it a little bit warming up,” manager Bud Black said. “He thought it would go away and it didn’t. So, we were very precautionary and got him out of the game. We’ll know more (about his status) in the next few days.”	Trailing 5-3 going into the top of the seventh, the Brewers pulled within a run on Avisaíl García’s RBI single off Yency Almonte.	The score was tied at 3 when the Rockies added a pair of runs in the bottom of the fifth off Milwaukee starter Adrian Houser on Blackmon’s RBI groundout and McMahon’s second hit of the night, a run-scoring single.	OPENING DAY 2.0	Granted clearance by state and local authorities and Major League Baseball to soon host full capacity crowds at Coors Field, the Rockies are planning to celebrate with what they have dubbed Opening Day 2.0.	Currently allowed to host 75% capacity, or 35,000, the Rockies were cleared to have a full capacity crowd of 50,000 effective Monday, June 28, when they host the Pittsburgh Pirates. The time of the game has been moved from a nighttime start to 3:10 p.m. to help accommodate the full pomp and ceremony that comes with Opening Day.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Rockies: RHP Jon Gray is scheduled to make a rehab start Sunday with the team’s Triple-A affiliate in Albuquerque. Gray, on the 10-day injured list with a right flexor strain, is scheduled to throw 60 to 70 pitches. He’ll be assessed by team trainers and medical staff after the outing and if all goes well, he could rejoin the Rockies rotation by the middle of next week.	UP NEXT	Brewers: With Milwaukee in the midst of playing 16 games in 16 days, LHP Eric Lauer (1-3, 5.18 ERA) is set to start Sunday’s series finale in Colorado. Lauer has been a sixth option in the rotation during this demanding stretch to try to alleviate the workload somewhat on the five regulars.	Rockies: RHP Chi Chi Gonzalez (2-4, 5.76 ERA) is slated to make his third start Sunday since being inserted into the rotation in place of the injured Jon Gray. He has allowed 12 runs over 11 innings in his two previous starts.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- — Shohei Ohtani's amazing first three months of the season shows no signs of slowing down.	The Japanese slugger homered for the fourth time in five games and matched his high for homers in a season as the Los Angeles Angels beat the Detroit Tigers 8-3 Saturday night.	Ohtani, who announced Friday that he would participate in next month’s All-Star Home Run Derby, has 22 homers and is tied for second-most in the majors with San Diego’s Fernando Tatis Jr. They are one behind Toronto’s Vladimir Guerrero Jr.	“He is dangerous from line to line right now. In every part of his game, it cannot be better,” manager Joe Maddon said.	Ohtani’s two-run, opposite-field shot to left off Wily Peralta (0-1) matched his total from 2018, when he won AL Rookie of the Year honors. That season, Ohtani hit 22 homers in 104 games and 367 plate appearances. This season, he reached the mark in his 66th game and 264th time at the plate.	It is the first time in four major league seasons that Ohtani has homered five times in four games. However, he did have four in three straight games in September 2018.	Ohtani’s homer was part of a four-run third inning by the Angels, who have won six straight home games. Jared Walsh also went deep in the inning , hitting a two-run drive to right field that put Los Angeles up 5-0.	Patrick Sandoval (2-2) struck out nine in 5 2/3 innings. The left-hander, who didn’t get his first major league victory as a starter until his 20th start last Sunday at Arizona, has won two straight.	“He was going along wonderfully and lost his tempo when I had to get him (in the sixth inning),” Maddon said. “This is another wonderful outing to build off of. As he gets more chances down the road, he can go more deeply.”	Daz Cameron had two hits, including a fourth-inning home run, and drove in two runs for Detroit, which has dropped three straight. Jonathan Schoop also had a solo shot in the fifth.	Peralta was making his first start since he was with the Milwaukee Brewers in 2017. The right-hander allowed five runs on seven hits in five innings and struck out two.	Hinch was hoping to get at least five innings out of Peralta so that he didn't have to go to his bullpen early. The right-hander threw 87 pitches, which is more than the 70-75 Hinch was hoping to get out of him before the game.	“I think the best part is he was able to recover from the bad inning and get us a couple more innings after that,” Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said of Peralta. “Once we fell behind, it was important for him to condition himself for the next start and he was able to do that with some zeros.”	THE LITTLE THINGS	David Fletcher had three hits and drove in a pair of runs for the Angels. One of his RBI came on a safety squeeze during the sixth inning, extending the Angels’ lead to 6-3.	Fletcher also had one of the best baserunning plays of the season during the third inning. He tagged up from first after Justin Upton popped up in foul ground to catcher Jake Rogers, and advanced to third when Peralta’s throw to second was high.	“It wasn’t close enough to the back stop to tag up, but I figured the pitcher wouldn’t be ready,” Fletcher said.	STOLEN MILESTONE	Upton’s stolen base during the eighth inning was the 150th of his career. He is the 39th player in big league history with 300-plus homers and at least 150 stolen bases.	WALSH’S POWER SURGE	Walsh has homered in two straight games and has 17 on the season. The first baseman has also gone deep 26 times since Sept. 4 of last season, second in the AL during that span.	Walsh scored the Angels’ first run in the second inning when he doubled to left-center with one out, advanced to third on Jose Iglesias’ single, and scored on grounder by Luis Rengifo.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: INF Niko Goodrum was placed on the 10-day injured list due to a tendon strain to his left finger. Goodrum was injured while he made a diving attempt on a ball during the sixth inning of Friday's game. INF Isaac Paredes was called up from Triple-A Toledo. He was originally slated to start at shortstop, but that changed when his plane was delayed and he couldn't get to the ballpark on time.	Angels: 3B Anthony Rendon returned to the lineup after missing the past four games due to a tricep issue. ... RHP Jaime Barria was called up from Triple-A Salt Lake while INF Kean Wong was sent down.	UP NEXT	Detroit wraps up a seven-game road trip with RHP Casey Mize (4-4, 3.49 ERA) taking the hill. The 2018 top pick in the college draft has a 2.96 ERA in eight road starts this season. He will be opposed by Angels RHP Dylan Bundy (1-7, 6.98), who allowed seven runs in 2 1/3 innings in last Tuesday's 8-5 loss at Oakland.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

PHOENIX -- — Will Smith has been behind the plate for plenty of Walker Buehler's starts dating back to their minor league days. It doesn't take the Dodgers catcher long to know if Buehler's got the good stuff.	Within a few pitches on Saturday night, Smith was sold: This was going to be fun.	“I'm glad he's on our side," Smith said. “And I don't have to face him.”	Buehler had another masterful mound performance, taking a no-hitter into the eighth inning as Los Angeles beat the skidding Arizona Diamondbacks 9-3.	The 26-year-old right-hander cruised through the Diamondbacks’ order, walking two, hitting a batter and striking out a season-best 11. He was pulled with one out in the eighth after giving up singles to David Peralta and Nick Ahmed.	“Felt like I had some gas left in the tank,” Buehler said. “But two good pieces of hitting and I'm out of there.”	Buehler (7-0) breezed through the seventh, striking out Eduardo Escobar and Christian Walker before getting Stephen Vogt to ground out. Peralta got a pitch up in the zone to start the eighth and lined a clean single into center. Buehler got a big hand from a sizable contingent of Dodgers’ fans at Chase Field in Phoenix.	“Man, I wanted that no-hitter,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. “Everyone wanted it. The fastball velocity was his best in quite some time. He was working all quadrants.”	Buehler hasn't been beaten in his past 23 starts, which tied a franchise record. Kirby Higbe set the mark in 1946.	Arizona has lost a franchise-record 16 straight and dropped 39 of its past 44 games. The Diamondbacks have the worst record in the major leagues at 20-52, and they set a major league record with their 23rd straight road loss Thursday.	The D-backs have had some rough moments during their lengthy skid. On Saturday, it was apparent that they simply ran into one of baseball's best pitchers.	“I feel like it was the combination of the fastball with the location that was very effective against us today,” D-backs manager Torey Lovullo said.	Matt Peacock (2-5) took the loss, giving up three runs over five innings. Kevin Ginkel and Jake Faria were both hit hard in relief, which allowed the Dodgers to build a 9-0 lead.	Smith had three hits for the Dodgers, including his eighth homer of the season. Justin Turner had three RBI. Chris Taylor hit a two-run homer in the eighth inning.	If Buehler’s no-hitter had continued, Roberts might have had a tough decision: Buehler was already at 101 pitches when he gave up Peralta’s single, nearing his season-high of 105. Roberts said he was willing to go to 125 pitches if needed.	“I was going to ride him,” Roberts said. “The pitch count is one thing, but if you peel back the layers, it's stress. And there wasn't any stress. He was repeating his delivery, he was locating his stuff. I was going to see it through. I wanted it for him.”	The Dodgers’ last no-hitter was May 4, 2018, when four pitchers combined on a 4-0 win over the San Diego Padres. Buehler started that game but was pulled after throwing 93 pitches. It was just his third big-league start.	SNAKEBIT	Diamondbacks catcher Carson Kelly broke his right wrist when he was hit by Buehler’s pitch in the second inning. Kelly had been one of few bright spots for Arizona this season, hitting .260 with an .845 OPS in 50 games. The 26-year-old was acquired from St. Louis in exchange for Paul Goldschmidt prior to the 2019 season.	Kelly was initally hopeful that he'd avoided serious injury but that wasn't the case.	“I had the initial movement, I had the strength,” Kelly said. “As time went on it kept getting worse and worse.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Dodgers: OF Cody Bellinger (hamstring) is expected to be activated off the injured list as early as Monday when the Dodgers face the San Diego padres. ... 1B Max Muncy (oblique) could also see action in the Padres series. He is not expected to have a rehabilitation assignment. … SS Corey Seager (hand) is expected to start a rehab assignment sometime next week.	Diamondbacks: LHP Madison Bumgarner (shoulder) is scheduled to pitch a bullpen session Tuesday.	UP NEXT	The two teams will conclude their three-game series on Sunday with the Dodgers sending RHP Tony Gonsolin (0-0, 3.38 ERA) to the mound. The Diamondbacks will start LHP Alex Young (2-4, 3.86).	------	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

SEATTLE -- — J.P. Crawford scored the winning run on Mitch Haniger's 10th-inning single and hit a grand slam to lift the Seattle Mariners over the Tampa Bay Rays 6-5 on Saturday night.	Tampa Bay pinch-hitter Brandon Lowe tied it 5-all with a solo home run in the top of the ninth off Kendall Graveman. Crawford had a chance to end it in the bottom of the inning, but struck out with a man on third.	He took second in the bottom of the 10th as the designated baserunner and scored on Haniger's single to left field off J.P. Feyereisen (3-3) for Seattle's third straight victory and sixth in its last seven.	“That's awesome what he's doing.” Seattle starter Logan Gilbert said. “That guy needs to be an All-Star.”	Crawford entered the game hitting .346 out of the leadoff spot this season. His first career slam helped send the Rays to a season-high fifth straight loss. It was the Mariners’ 16th come-from-behind win, and they’re now 7-1 in extra innings.	Crawford's liner to right field skipped off the top of the wall and into the stands to cap a five-run second inning against Rays starter Josh Fleming. The Gold Glove shortstop said the slam was especially emotional given the day, as the Mariners wore throwback jerseys similar to those of the Seattle Steelheads of the Negro Leagues as a Juneteenth celebration.	“It hit me a little differently today with everything going on with Juneteenth and wearing those jerseys,” said Crawford, who is Black. “It was just so special to me.”	Asked if he would be saving his jersey, Crawford said: “It's in my backpack. I'm taking that home and framing it."	Former Rays player Jake Bauers added an RBI single in the second inning.	Touted prospect Logan Gilbert struck out seven — including leadoff hitter Randy Arozarena three times — in 5 2/3 innings, scattering six hits with no walks. He gave up solo home runs to Mike Zunino and Manuel Margot that cut the Mariners’ lead to 5-4 in the sixth. He was headed to his third straight win until Graveman's blown save, his first of the season in six attempts.	Rafael Montero (4-2) pitched the 10th to win the game.	Joey Wendle and Zunino each drove in a run in the second inning to give Tampa Bay a 2-0 lead. But Kyle Seager, Tom Murphy and Bauers led off the second with hits and Fleming walked Dylan Moore to load the bases. He struck out the next two batters before Crawford connected.	Fleming struck out five over 6 1/3 innings with two walks. He allowed just three hits after the second inning, but regretted the sinker he threw to Crawford.	“I didn't think it was a terrible pitch. ... I really just see it as one pitch that beat me,” Fleming said.	ROSTER MOVE	The Rays called up RHP Drew Rasmussen and optioned INF Mike Brosseau to Triple-A Durham. Rasmussen, acquired May 21 from the Milwaukee Brewers in the Willy Adames trade, made his debut, striking out four in 1 2/3 innings.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Mariners: An MRI shows a strained muscle in RHP Justin Dunn’s right shoulder and he’ll be shut down for two weeks, manager Scott Servais said. Once Dunn resumes throwing, he’ll be re-evaluated. Dunn took himself out after two innings in his last start and went on the 10-day injured list for the second time this month on Friday.	UP NEXT	Rays: LHP Shane McClanahan (2-2, 4.42) closes out the series for the Rays. Seventy percent of McClanahan’s runs allowed have come with two outs.	Mariners: LHP Marco Gonzales (1-4, 5.44) has gone 0-2 since returning from the 10-day injured list for a left forearm strain on May 31.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

PITTSBURGH -- — Josh Naylor foiled Pittsburgh's strategy with an RBI single in the seventh inning, helping the Cleveland Indians beat the Pirates 2-1 Sunday.	Cleveland avoided a three-game sweep by the Pirates, who had lost 10 straight entering the series. The Indians have won seven of 10.	The lefty-swinging Naylor sent the first pitch he saw from left-handed reliever Chasen Shreve to right, driving in Eddie Rosario to break a 1-all tie. Naylor, who had an earlier hit, was batting .189 against lefties and .277 vs. righties.	Naylor thought manager Terry Francona would go with a pinch-hitter.	“I kind of peeked in the dugout and tripped over my own feet because I'm expecting to turn around,” Naylor said. “I'm pretty sure the whole stadium knew they were going to bring in the lefty. I was prepared for it. I was waiting for it. It wasn't really shocking.”	The hit came after Pirates manager Derek Shelton pulled starter JT Brubaker (4-6) with two out in the seventh. The right-handed Brubaker threw just 76 pitches, gave up three hits and tied his career-high with nine strikeouts.	“It was all about the matchup,” Shelton said. “JT did a heck of a job. He threw the ball extremely well, was extremely efficient. We went into that inning, if we had a guy on base and we had the left-hander there, we were going to go to Shreve.”	After forcing Harold Ramirez to ground out for the the second out, Brubaker figured he might have a chance to face Naylor.	“I took a peek out in the bullpen, saw we had Shreve and (Clay) Holmes warming up,” Brubaker said. “Once I saw Shelty come out, I knew it was a situational pull. Try to get that left-on-left matchup. Shreve got that groundball, and it just had some eyes.”	James Karinchak struck out Colin Moran looking, stranding Kevin Newman at second in the ninth for his eighth save. Karinchak allowed a three-run homer by Bryan Reynolds in the seventh inning of a 6-3 loss on Saturday.	The Pirates had runners on first and third and one out in the seventh, but Trevor Stephan got Gregory Polanco to pop out and Adam Frazier to fly out.	Brubaker retired the first 13 batters until Ramirez hit a drive into the left-field bleachers to put the Indians up 1-0 with one out in the fifth. Ramirez homered twice Saturday.	“You can tell our guys love (Ramirez),” Francona said. “Brings energy and gives you an honest day's effort. He's really been really helpful, so important to our team. We play him everywhere in the outfield. He hits everywhere. He just seems to get his barrel to the ball.”	Jacob Stallings tied it 1-all with a two-out single off Phil Maton (2-0) in the sixth.	Maton struck out the side that inning, but allowed three hits in relief of Sam Hentges, who gave up two hits with four strikeouts in five innings.	It was Hentges’ first start since giving up four runs in 2 1/3 innings against the Toronto Blue Jays on May 30. He had made three relief appearances since.	“We kind of just found a rhythm there in the second and third,” Hentges said. “Rode that out until the end of the fifth.”	Reynolds had the only hit for either team through four innings, doubling off Hentges in the first. Reynolds sent a bloop into right field, where Cesar Hernandez dropped an over-the-shoulder attempt.	“Their starter, he has really good stuff,” Stallings said. “His stuff is really good, so he executed pitches. They threw really good bullpen arms at us. I think it might just have been one of those days.”	ROSTER MOVE	Pittsburgh recalled LHP Austin Davis from Triple-A Indianapolis. He pitched the ninth, retiring three batters after allowing a leadoff walk.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Indians: RHP Shane Bieber will be reassessed at some point this week, pitching coach Carl Willis said. Bieber was placed on the 10-day injured list with a right shoulder muscle strain on June 14.	Pirates: LHP Sam Howard went on the 10-day IL retroactive to June 19 with right knee tendinitis.	UP NEXT	Indians: RHP Aaron Civale (10-2, 3.48 ERA) will take the mound against the Cubs in Chicago on Monday. Civale allowed five runs, tying his season high, in five innings Wednesday.	Pirates: LHP Tyler Anderson (3-7, 4.89) is expected to start the first of a two-game set against the Chicago White Sox on Tuesday. In his last start, Anderson gave up a season-high six runs in six innings Tuesday.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

WASHINGTON -- — Kyle Schwarber homered three times and tied a major league record with five in a two-game span, leading the Washington Nationals over the New York Mets 5-2 Sunday to take three of four in the series.	Schwarber set a Nationals/Montreal Expos record by homering nine times in a 10-game span, increasing his total to 18 this season with his first career three homer-game. Moved in the leadoff spot on June 12, Schwarber had four RBI for the second straight game.	“To be honest with you, I don’t know what’s going on,” Schwarber said.	He hit a 2-0 fastball from Taijuan Walker (6-3) for his fourth leadoff home run this season, capped an eight-pitch at-bat starting the fifth by homering on a sinker for a 3-1 lead.	“I think he’s just locked in right now,” Walker said. “He was just hitting every fastball we threw at him.”	Schwarber then hit an 0-1 slider from Jeurys Familia for a two-run homer into the Mets' bullpen in left field in the seventh.	“That’s as hot as you can get,” Mets manager Luis Rojas said.	Schwarber had the sixth three-homer game since the franchise moved to Washington for the 2005 season, the first since Anthony Rendon's 10-RBI game against the Mets on April 30, 2017.	“I’m a big believer that hitting is a feeling. Don’t get me wrong, there’s mechanical, there’s approach, things like that,” Schwarber said. “But when you step in the box and everything feels right, you already have a big advantage.”	Schwarber's third homer followed a pinch-hit double by Gerardo Parra, a 34-year-old fan favorite who returned to the Nationals on Sunday when his contract was selected from Triple-A Rochester. Parra's walkup music of the children's song “Baby Shark” became a theme of the Nationals’ run to the 2019 World Series title, and it sounded before his at-bat to the crowd's delight.	Parra spent last season with the Yomiuri Giants in Japan, then signed a minor league contract with the Nationals last winter.	“Almost cried,” Parra said of the crowd reaction.	Patrick Corbin (5-5) allowed two runs and four hits in six innings with seven strikeouts and a walk. He retired 15 of 16 batters on 76 pitches through six innings.	Pete Alonso homered leading off the seventh. ending a 38 at-bat homerless stretch with his 11th this season. Alonso reached 80 home runs in 274 games, third-fewest behind Ryan Howard (245) and Aaron Judge (264).	A shifted third baseman Starlin Castro snagged pinch-hitter Dominic Smith's smash up the middle off Kyle Finnegan for a double play in the seventh.	New York scored just nine runs in the four-game series. Despite going 2 for 14 with runners in scoring position, Washington closed within five games of the NL East-leading Mets.	“It’s really clicking,” Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. “Every guy is doing their part.”	Walker, who had allowed just two prior homers this season, dropped to 2/3 on the road to go along with a 4-0 home mark. He allowed four runs and a season-high 10 hits in 6 1/3 innings.	Kevin Pillar's sixth homer tied the score in the second, and Josh Bell hit a go-ahead single in the third.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Nationals: RHP Daniel Hudson (right elbow inflammation) is still not throwing a baseball. He has not pitched since June 9 and his recovery is a “slow process,” according to Martinez.	Mets: OF Brandon Nimmo (detached hand ligament) went 1 for 2 as began a minor league rehab assignment Sunday with Triple-A Syracuse. Nimmo played just 21 games for the Mets, the last May 2. ... OF Michael Conforto (strained right hamstring) was 1 for 4 with a double against Scranton/Wilkes-Barre's Deivi García. Conforto was playing his third rehab game.	UP NEXT	Mets: RHP Jacob deGrom (6-2, 0.54) is expected to start the opener of Monday's doubleheader at home against Atlanta, New York's second twin bill in three days.	Nationals: RHP Max Scherzer (5-4, 2.21 ERA) is likely to be activated from the 10-day injured list and start Tuesday at Philadelphia.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

NEW YORK -- — Yankees manager Aaron Boone knew it off the bat.	“Usually, a triple play sneaks up on you,” he said. “Right away, I’m thinking, ‘That’s a triple play.’”	New York turned its record-tying third triple play of the season to strand the go-ahead run in the ninth inning, bailing out closer Aroldis Chapman from a shaky outing and closing down a 2-1 win over the Oakland Athletics on Sunday.	Gary Sánchez spoiled Sean Manaea's gem with a go-ahead two-run double in the sixth inning, and relievers Jonathan Loaisiga (7-2) and Lucas Luetge turned a 2-1 lead over to Chapman in the ninth.	A day after reaching 103.4 mph during his 15th save — his fastest pitch on a strikeout since the 2017 AL wild-card game — Chapman walked Jed Lowrie and Chad Pinder on nine pitches, topping out at 98 mph.	He was visited by an athletic trainer because the nail in his left middle finger broke but stayed in the game to face Sean Murphy, who drilled the second pitch of the at-bat right at third baseman Gio Urshela.	Urshela stepped on third and whizzed the ball to DJ LeMahieu, and the second baseman relayed to first baseman Chris Gittens to get Murphy by a step.	“You're around long enough, you see everything,” longtime A's manager Bob Melvin said. “I've never seen a game end like that before.”	New York also turned the first 1-3-6-2-5-6 triple play in major league history on Thursday at Buffalo against the Blue Jays and also had an around-the-horn triple play on May 21 against the Chicago White Sox involving Urshela, second baseman Rougned Odor and first baseman Luke Voit. The storied franchise had never turned more than one triple play in a season and tied a major league record for most in a season, last accomplished by the 2016 Chicago White Sox.	The triple plays have happened over 31 days, the shortest span ever for three by a big league team.	Chapman's 16th save in 18 tries sent Oakland to its first road series loss this season after eight wins and a split. The A's had just four hits.	Loaisiga cleaned up Yankees starter Jordan Montgomery's jam in the sixth and covered 1 2/3 scoreless innings, helping New York lock up its fifth win in six games — all when trailing after the fifth.	“It felt like a big series, coming off some really quality wins in Buffalo,” Boone said.	Manaea (6-3) struck out a career-high 11 and Matt Olson homered for Oakland, but the A's dropped their second straight after ending a seven-game winning streak Saturday.	“There couldn’t have been a more, routine’s not the word, but triple play set-up,” Olson said. “Tough way to lose.”	Manaea — a winner in three straight starts — cruised until the sixth, when he walked two batters ahead of the red-hot Sánchez.	Sánchez lined his second double of the game into the right-center gap, scoring both runners for a 2-1 lead.	The slow-footed Sánchez got hung up between second and third on the play but juked around a tag attempt from A's third baseman Matt Chapman before diving to get a hand onto the bag.	Yankee Stadium roared, groaned and roared again on the roller coaster play, then let out another ovation when umpires upheld the safe call on replay review.	“It feels great, given all the work that I've done with the hitting coaches, seeing the results right now,” Sánchez said via translator. “Seeing the fruits of all that work feels great.”	A two-time All-Star, Sánchez lost his starting job during last year's postseason due to an extended slump, one that stretched into the start of 2021. He's surged back to top form in June, entering Sunday hitting .294 with a 1.012 OPS this month. He has five homers in his past 10 games, and 11 of his past 17 hits have gone for extra bases.	“He's on time,” Boone said. “He's making really good decisions. Doesn't mean you're always going to get results, but it's not an accident now that he's getting really good results.”	Manaea — throwing exclusively fastballs and changeups — dominated New York for most of his 5 1/3 innings. The left-hander had 20 swings and misses on his sinker, the most by a pitcher with a two-seam fastball or sinker in a game since at least 2008 when pitch tracking began.	Olson hit his 20th homer in the first inning, jumping on Montgomery's 1-0 fastball for a solo shot to center field.	Montgomery pitched through the fifth without further damage but ran into trouble in the sixth, walking leadoff hitter Mark Canha and allowing a one-out single to Olson. Loaisiga relieved and got two groundouts to keep New York within 1-0.	Matt Chapman hit a one-out triple in the eighth that nearly clered the fence in left-center. He was stranded when Luetge struck out Olson and got a lineout from Ramón Laureano.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: Manager Bob Melvin believed OF Stephen Piscotty (strained left wrist) planned to fly to Arizona on Sunday to see a specialist.	Yankees: LHP Zach Britton was unavailable due to general soreness. He made his season debut last week following surgery to remove a bone chip in his pitching elbow. ... Voit (strained oblique) was 2 for 4 with two RBI with Double-A Somerset. He's expected to be activated Tuesday. ... RHP Darren O’Day (strained right rotator cuff) will begin a minor league rehab assignment Tuesday.

BALTIMORE -- — Reese McGuire had three doubles during a four-hit performance, leading Hyun Jin Ryu and the Toronto Blue Jays past the Baltimore Orioles 7-4 Sunday.	Toronto, which snapped a five-game skid by erasing a three-run deficit with two outs in the ninth inning Saturday on the way to a 10-7 victory, won in less stressful fashion in the series finale. The Blue Jays claimed their first set since sweeping two games from Miami on June 1-2 while also getting back to .500.	“As a whole, this was a huge series for us,” said McGuire, who enjoyed his first four-hit day since Aug. 8, 2019, against the New York Yankees. “To roll into the off day, but also as we approach the All-Star break and try to inch ourselves closer to the lead in the AL.”	Trey Mancini homered twice for Baltimore, which has dropped 10 of its last 11 and is an American League-worst 23-48.	Ryu (6-4) breezed through seven innings aside from Mancini’s solo shot in the first. Ryu gave up three hits and walked one while striking out four and retiring 17 of the last 18 batters he faced.	“He was locating, and that’s a key for him,” Toronto manager Charlie Montoyo said. “It’s key for any pitcher, but when he locates with his pitches, he’s tough to hit because he keeps people off balance when he does that.”	Ryu is 2-0 with a 0.95 ERA in three starts against Baltimore since joining the Blue Jays last season. Ryu’s last strikeout Sunday was the 806th of his career, tying him with Byung-hyun Kim for the second most among South Korea-born pitchers. Chan Ho Park had 1,715.	Baltimore closed within 6-4 on Pedro Severino’s solo homer and Mancini’s two-run drive --- the 100th home run of his career --- off Trent Thornton in the eighth.	Mancini reached the milestone with his 14th homer of the year after missing all of 2020 while undergoing treatment for colon cancer.	“There were a lot of times last year where I felt I would always be stuck on 86 and not get the opportunity to hit any more,” Mancini said. “It’s definitely something I cherish and don’t take for granted.”	Tyler Chatwood handled the ninth for his first save since 2019 and the Blue Jays’ first since May 30.	Toronto got to Baltimore starter Matt Harvey (3-9) in the fifth inning. Bo Bichette’s one-out RBI single tied it at 1 and, after a walk, Teoscar Hernández’s double gave the Blue Jays the lead. Randal Grichuk and Cavan Biggio followed with RBI singles to make it 4-1 and end Harvey’s afternoon.	Harvey allowed four runs on nine hits in 4 1/3 innings and struck out five. He is 0-8 with an 11.49 ERA in nine starts since May 7, and has not completed five innings once in that span.	“The stuff was good early and obviously it wasn’t there in the fifth,” Harvey said. “I’m kicking myself. With the stuff I had early, I should have been in the sixth, seventh inning and there should be a lot less runs on the board.”	McGuire drove in a run on a double in the eighth, then scored on Bichette’s single. He added an RBI single in the ninth.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Blue Jays: Toronto reinstated Hernández from the paternity list and optioned OF Jared Hoying to Triple-A Buffalo. Hoying was 0 for 3 in two games with the Blue Jays. … RHP Jeremy Beasley was optioned to Buffalo after the game. … General manager Ross Atkins said LHP Steven Matz (COVID-related) has thrown up to 70 pitches and could rejoin the Blue Jays this week in Miami. .... LHP Ryan Borucki (forearm flexor strain) has thrown off a mound, while RHP Julian Merryweather (oblique strain) could do so soon. … RHP Rafael Dolis (middle finger strain) threw a bullpen session Saturday.	SEASON HIGH	The Orioles announced a crowd of 14,917, their largest of the season. Baltimore, which expanded to full capacity on June 1, had its second-largest crowd of 2021 on Friday when it drew 13,284.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays: Toronto has Monday off. The Blue Jays begin a two-game series at Miami with RHP Ross Stripling (2-4, 4.64 ERA) getting the nod.	Orioles: LHP Keegan Akin (0-2, 5.76), who threw a career-high 5 2/3 innings at Cleveland on Wednesday, draws the start as Baltimore opens a three-game series Monday against Houston.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- — Jarrod Dyson capped a 10-pitch at-bat with a tiebreaking, two-run double in a three-run third inning off Nathan Eovaldi, and the Kansas City Royals rallied to beat the Boston Red Sox 7-3 Sunday for their first series win in nearly three weeks.	“It was a good series win against a good team,” Royals manager Mike Matheny said. “We are seeing a lot of components coming together.”	Mike Minor (6-4) allowed two runs and nine hits over 6 2/3 innings for the Royals, who had lost 12 of their previous 14 games. “If felt like I made decent pitches and felt pretty good,” Minor said. “That is a tough team over there and luckily we were able to take the series.”	Whit Merrifield got his 800th major league hit in the first and hit a two-run homer in the sixth against Yacksel Ríos.	Kansas City, which won two of three against Boston, had not won a series since taking two games from Pittsburgh on May 31 and June 1.	Eovaldi (7-4) lost his second straight decision after winning four in a row. He gave up four runs — three earned — and seven hits in four innings.	Kansas City out-hit Boston 15-11. The Red Sox stranded 10 runners and went 1 for 7 with runners in scoring position as they lost for only the second time in their last six games. “Offensively we just didn’t get the big hit," Red Sox manager Alex Cora said. "We started well but we just couldn’t get that big hit today,”	With Boston leading 2-0 on Kiké Hernández's two-run homer on an 0-2 slider in the second, first baseman Bobby Dalbec allowed Michael A. Taylor's two-out grounder to bounce off his glove for a run-scoring error in the bottom half.	Salvador Pérez tied the score with a third-inning single for his 47th RBI, and Dyson's double to left put the Royals ahead 4-2. “That Dyson at-bat changed the game,” Matheny said. “It could have been a huge momentum shift if we didn’t score, but Dyson comes up and put up the best at-bat of the year.”	Merrifield homered in the sixth to make it 6-2. Hunter Dozier, who stopped an 0-for-21 slide with a single in the second, added an RBI single in the sixth.	Rafael Devers hit his 18th home run of the season in the eighth, a drive off Carlos Hernández.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Red Sox: C Kevin Plawecki left in the fourth inning with left hamstring tightness. ... 2B Christian Arroyo exited in the fifth with a right shinbone bruise after sliding awkwardly to avoid a collision with Kiké Hernández on a fly ball in shallow center.	Royals: C Cam Gallagher (right shoulder impingement syndrome) was placed on the 10-day injured list. Kansas City recalled Sebastian Rivero from Triple-A Omaha.

HOUSTON -- — Dallas Keuchel lost in his first appearance against Houston, and Abraham Toro had a career-high four hits to lead the Astros over the Chicago White Sox 8-2 Sunday for their seventh straight win.	Keuchel, a two-time All-Star for the Astros who helped the franchise win its first World Series title in 2017, won the 2015 AL Cy Young Award with Houston. He went 76-63 in seven seasons with the Astros and left after the 2018 season for Atlanta before signing a $55.5 million, three-year contract with Chicago after the 2019 season.	Keuchel (6-2) tied a season high by allowing six runs — three earned — in a season-low 2 2/3 innings as the AL Central leaders lost their season-high fourth straight.	“Not a lot of good, a lot of bad,” Keuchel said of the four-game series. “It’s just one of those four-game series where you face a good team that’s hot, and you’re not really doing anything good on your end, so it was a good old-fashioned butt-whooping.”	He gave up seven hits and four walks, leaving after throwing 41 pitches in the third.	“It was weird,” Keuchel said of returning to Houston. “I had every emotion under the sun going there. I wasn’t making terrible pitches, but at the same time, I wasn’t giving myself any room to breathe. … I just couldn’t really stop the bleeding there in the third, and I wasn’t around the zone as much as I would have liked to from the previous couple outings.”	He was given a video tribute Thursday during the series opener, and the crowd 39,821 gave him a standing ovation when he came out Sunday.	The 33-year-old left-hander had been 5-0 in eight starts since an April 30 defeat to Cleveland.	Toro, a 24-year-old who made his big league debut in August 2019, improved to 7 for 11 since he was brought up from the minors last week. He was 1 for 12 during an April callup and was hitting .352 with two homers and 11 RBI in 17 games at Triple-A Sugar Land.	He hit an RBI infield single in the first and added three more singles before striking out.	“He’s been playing great,” Houston manager Dusty Baker said. “I think it helped him to go down there and play every day, find his stroke, find his confidence. He’s given us all that we needed.”	Lance McCullers Jr. (4-1) gave up two runs and two hits in six innings and Carlos Correa homered for the Astros, on their longest winning streak since taking eight in a row from last Aug. 12-20.	“I think we’ve been playing good,” McCullers said. “Everything has started to come along. We had to run through a lot of tough teams here, especially in this first half of the season. I thought our guys have played extremely well. You just have to continue winning ballgames.”	McCullers won his third straight decision and has allowed three runs or fewer in each of his last eight starts.	“I felt like my velocity was there,” McCullers said. “The breaking stuff was there, the changeups. … This is really the first time in about a month that I was able to go out there freely and throw my breaking stuff.”	Jake Lamb’s two-run homer put the White Sox ahead in the second, but Houston took a 6-2 lead in the third, when Yordan Álvarez hit a two-run single, Taylor Jones had an RBI double, Keuchel walked José Altuve with the bases loaded and reliever Matt Foster walked Chas McCormick with the bases full.	Correa homered leading off the fourth, and Michael Brantley had an RBI single in the fifth.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Astros: OF Kyle Tucker, who is on the injured list due to health and safety protocols, said he did not have COVID-19, but he was working to get his strength back following an illness. Baker said Saturday that Tucker probably wouldn’t be activated until Monday.	UP NEXT	White Sox: RHP Lucas Giolito (5-5, 3.86 ERA) is scheduled to make his 15th start of the season on Tuesday when Chicago travels to Pittsburgh for a two-game series. Giolito is 4-7 with a 5.49 ERA in 14 interleague starts.	Astros: RHP Jake Odorizzi (1-3, 5.68) will start Monday in the opener of a three-game series at Baltimore. Odorizzi threw four scoreless innings on Tuesday in relief against the Rangers and has allowed three runs or fewer in each of his last five appearances.	------	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

ATLANTA -- — Adam Wainwright was proud to pitch the 26th complete game of his career, no matter how long it went.	“I’ll take them however they give them to me," he said. “If the next one is a five-inning rainout, I’ll take that one, too. I like going the distance. That’s a notch on the belt. That’s what we strive to do."	Wainwright struck out 11 and pitched a three-hitter in going the full seven innngs, sending the St. Louis Cardinals over the Atlanta Braves 9-1 Sunday in the first game of a day-night doubleheader.	Nolan Arenado hit a two-run homer off Bryse Wilson in the first and Paul Goldschmidt added a three-run shot off Josh Tomlin in the fifth.	The 39-year-old Wainwright (5-5) didn’t allow a hit until the fourth, when Freddie Freeman singled.	Wainwright struck out slugger Ronald Acuña Jr. with a runner at second to end the fifth and St. Louis leading 6-1. With his second complete game this season, Wainwright tied Justin Verlander for most overall among active pitchers.	Wainwright reversed a trend in which he was 1-2 with an 8.20 in four road starts this year. He also improved to 8-0 in 10 doubleheader starts.	The Brunswick, Georgia, native had plenty of support in the stands.	“I set out today to pitch the entire game and got that done, especially against the Braves," Wainwright said. “I had a bunch, a bunch, a bunch of people in the stands today. A lot of people were rooting for me. I appreciate it."	After rain postponed Saturday’s game to force the doubleheader, the Cardinals snapped a six-game road losing streak, their longest under fourth-year manager Mike Shildt.	St. Louis had scored only 10 runs in its last seven games and was held to six hits and one run in the first two games of this four-game series before breaking loose.	The Braves, who play another doubleheader Monday at the New York Mets, have dropped seven of 10.	Tommy Edman singled off Wilson (2-3) to begin the first and stole second base to set up Arenado, who snapped a 0-for-20 slump with his 13th homer. Tyler O’Neill doubled to start the fourth and scored on Yadier Molina’s single.	Goldschmidt’s 10th homer came on Tomlin’s first pitch.	Braves manager Brian Snitker has marveled at Wainwright throughout the right-hander's long, successful career.	“It’s amazing," Snitker said. “He’s bouncing around there like he’s 20 years old. He’s done a great job of keeping himself together through a lot of adversity. He’s had injuries, too. The Achilles, the elbow, the whole thing — man, I told him five or six years ago that I hate it when he pitches against us, but it’s fun to watch him pitch. He can pitch."	TRAINER’S ROOM	Snitker had no update on the status of LHP Tucker Davidson, who avoided Tommy John surgery last week after being diagnosed with a forearm strain. “He’s in that shutdown phase where they’re just going to cool everything down for a while,” Snitker said.	STREAK STOPS	Acuña went 0 for 3 to snap the major leagues’ longest current on-base streak at 26 straight games.	UP NEXT	Drew Smyly (3-3, 5.63 ERA) will face St. Louis for the second time in his career in the nightcap. Kwang Hyun Kim is facing Atlanta for the first time. ... Braves RHP Ian Anderson (4-3, 3.58) and LHP Kyle Muller (0-0, 18.00) are set to start Monday’s doubleheader for Atlanta in a yet-to-be-determined order. ... The Cardinals are off Monday. Johan Oviedo will start Tuesday’s game at Detroit.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO -- — Alec Mills watched as the Chicago Cubs got battered in back-to-back games by the Miami Marlins. Things sure were different this time.	Mills and three relievers combined on a shutout and Chicago bounced back from two lopsided losses to beat Miami 2-0 Sunday and avoid a sweep.	“A lot of us starters have similar repertoires, but I think we're all different in our own kind of way,” Mills said. “We kind of attacked maybe a little bit differently the first two days. I kind of changed it up, maybe worked a little bit more toward the inner half of the plate, especially against the righties."	Outscored 21-3 in the previous two days at Wrigley Field, the Cubs squeezed out the win despite managing just four hits. They also extended their season-high streak of scoring no more than three runs to eight games.	But Chicago came out on top thanks to a solid start by Mills (3-1) and a perfect performance by the bullpen.	Marlins rookie Zach Thompson (1-2) took the hard-luck loss after holding the held the Cubs to one unearned run over four no-hit innings.	Pinch-hitter Patrick Wisdom opened the fifth against Miami reliever Ross Detweiler by singling on the 15th pitch of the at-bat, hanging in after falling behind 0-2 and hitting nine foul balls to give himself more chances.	Wisdom later scored on Joc Pederson's single  to make it 2-0. The Cubs came away with the win after dropping five of six to fall into a first-place tie with Milwaukee in the NL Central.	MILLS, BULLPEN DOMINATE	Mills worked around six hits over five innings. The right-hander struck out three without a walk.	The bullpen shut down Miami the rest of the way, with Ryan Tepera throwing two innings and Andrew Chafin working the eighth before Craig Kimbrel came on in the ninth for his 20th save in 22 chances. Kimbrel also tied Jonathan Papelbon for ninth on baseball's all-time saves list with 368.	It was just what the Cubs needed after getting knocked around for 10 or more runs in back-to-back home games for the first time since August 2015 against Detroit.	THOMPSON SHARP	Thompson struck out seven and walked three in his third major league start. The 27-year-old right-hander threw 73 pitches, after beating Atlanta for his first career win eight days earlier.	“This will probably give me a lot of confidence knowing that I can pitch against a pretty good lineup,” Thompson said. “Whoever I'm facing, when you have 38,000 people screaming at you with a good lineup, being able to face these guys and do well against them, I mean, that's priceless for moving forward.”	Adam Duvall went 0 for 4 after joining Derrek Lee in 2002 and Giancarlo Stanton in 2016 as the only Marlins with back-to-back multi-homer games. Duvall hit a grand slam and two-run shot Friday and two more two-run drives on Saturday.	“Obviously, today's not the way we wanted to end it," manager Don Mattingly said. "But I think we did get back on track as far as being able to swing the bats.”	QUOTABLE	“It was very fun to battle like that. I get to first and the pitcher just kind of looks over at me and we just kind of made the eye contact, like, ‘Dang, what a battle.’ Obviously, I love to come out on top and spark that inning, get a run in. It was huge for us.” — Wisdom on his 15-pitch at-bat.	TRANSACTIONS	The Cubs selected LHP Kyle Ryan from Triple-A Iowa and optioned RHP Cory Abbott to Iowa. They also designated RHP Robert Stock for assignment.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: Manager David Ross acknowledged INF Matt Duffy's recovery from a strained lower back is taking longer than the Cubs expected. Duffy has not played since May 22. “It's something that's I think more of a chronic injury that we want to make sure that we take care of before we get him back,” Ross said. ... The Cubs hope to have 2B Nico Hoerner (strained left hamstring) start a rehab assignment in the next week to 10 days. ... LHP Justin Steele (right hamstring strain), sidelined since May 20, threw a bullpen session on Sunday.	UP NEXT	Marlins: Miami opens a two-game series against Toronto at home on Tuesday, with RHP Sandy Alcantara (4-6, 3.09 ERA) starting for the Marlins and RHP Ross Stripling (2-4, 4.64) pitching for the Blue Jays. Alcantara lost 1-0 at St. Louis last week, when Paul Goldschmidt reached on an error by shortstop Jazz Chisholm Jr. leading off the ninth and scored on Yadier Molina's one-out single.	Cubs: RHP Adbert Alzolay (4-5, 4.06) returns from a blister on his right middle finger as the Cubs open a two-game series against Cleveland. RHP Aaron Civale (10-2, 3.48), tops in the majors in wins, starts for the Indians.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- — Byron Buxton launched an early two-run homer into the second deck, Kenta Maeda earned his first win since May 3 and the Minnesota Twins beat the reeling Texas Rangers 4-2 Sunday for their fourth straight win.	The Twins matched their longest winning streak of the season. Minnesota slugger Nelson Cruz exited with neck tightness after singling in the first inning and striking out on three pitches in the third.	The Rangers have lost six straight, equaling their longest skid of the season. They’ve dropped 19 of their last 22 games to fall 21 games under .500, their most since the end of the 2018 season (67-95).	Buxton, who returned to the lineup Saturday after missing 39 games with a strained right hip, hit his first home run since May 4. He connected eight pitches into the game, tagging Dane Dunning (2-6) after Luis Arraez led off with a single.	“Byron just picks back up where he kind of left off,” Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. “These are the kinds of things that he does, and he’s just a fantastic player.”	The Twins added two runs in the third when Max Kepler pulled a two-out single to right field scoring Trevor Larnach, and Jorge Polanco also scored when the ball scooted under Joey Gallo’s glove.	Maeda (3-2) was cruising before giving up back-to-back homers to Adolis Garcia and Gallo with one out in the sixth to end his day. He allowed five hits throwing 84 pitches in his second start since missing 20 games with a right adductor strain.	Relievers Tyler Duffey, Jorge Alcala and Hansel Robles held Texas scoreless over the final 3 2/3 innings on one hit and one walk. Robles earned his sixth save in eight opportunities.	Dunning gave up 10 hits in four innings, failing to win for his seventh straight start. His 18 first-inning runs this season are the most in the American League.	In the three losses, Texas batters hit .210 with 22 strikeouts and five walks. On Sunday, Garcia and Gallo had four of the Rangers’ six hits.	“If we’re going to be a complete offense, we’ve got to get production from everybody,” Texas manager Chris Woodward said.	SHORT HOPS	The three-game series sweep was Minnesota’s second of the season, the other coming May 24-26 at home vs. Baltimore. It was the Twins’ first road sweep since Sept. 24-26, 2019 at Detroit. … Garcia’s 18th homers are the most for a Rangers rookie before the All-Star break. He’s hit four vs. Minnesota in seven games. … Arraez, Andrelton Simmons and Larnach each had three hits. … Gallo, who won a Gold Glove last season, also had a two-base throwing error in the eighth inning.	‘PEN IS MIGHTIER	During the Twins’ four-game winning streak, their bullpen has allowed only three earned runs in 16 2/3 innings.	“It’s fun to know you’re getting called on to get a job done and then get the job done," said Duffey, who went 1 2/3 innings Sunday.	HONORING MIKE BELL	The Twins will honor their 2020 bench coach, Mike Bell, who died March 26 at age 46 from cancer, in a tribute before Monday’s home game against Cincinnati. The Reds are managed by Mike’s brother, David. Mike was the Rangers’ first-round supplemental draftee in 1993.

DENVER -- — Daniel Vogelbach hit a tiebreaking single in the ninth and the Milwaukee Brewers rebounded from Colorado’s four-homer barrage in the sixth inning to beat the Rockies 7-6 on Sunday.	The Rockies trailed 6-0 in the sixth before Yonathan Daza hit a two-run homer off Eric Lauer and Trevor Story followed with a 466-foot shot to chase the Milwaukee starter.	“It was a crazy inning,” Lauer said. “I just ran out of gas. I tried to fight through it and get through that inning.”	Reliever Zack Godley gave up a single, then a 456-foot homer to C.J. Cron to make it 6-5 with no outs. One out later, Joshua Fuentes tied it with the fourth of the inning.	“After Cron I had a great feeling,” Fuentes said. “That’s what we do, we feed off each other.”	It was the third time in franchise history and second time this season the Rockies hit four homers in an inning, and all three have come at Coors Field. The first time came June 6, 1999, against the Brewers and most recently April 2 against the Los Angeles Dodgers.	“Sometimes it’s contagious, an inning. I think that’s what happened today,” Rockies manager Bud Black said. “You could feel in the dugout the momentum starting to turn our way.”	Milwaukee took the lead in the ninth when pinch-hitter Jace Peterson singled off Daniel Bard (3-4), stole second and scored on a play at the plate on Vogelbach’s hit.	“When he hit it I froze for a second, and once I knew it was down it was score from there,” Peterson said. “Put my head down and run. I knew it’d be close but I thought I thought I’d have it.”	Devin Williams (3-1) struck out the side in the eighth to earn the win. Brad Boxberger pitched the ninth for his third save in as many chances.	“You never feel you’re in command of a game here, you never feel you’re out of a game here and you have to play it like that,” Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said. “It’s just the way this place is. You expect it almost. To come out with a win after losing that lead is a credit to the guys.”	Cron finished with three hits. Raimel Tapia had a pair of singles in the sixth inning to extend his hitting streak to 17 games, the longest current streak in the majors.	Colorado managed just two singles after the sixth inning.	Kolten Wong’s two-run homer and two singles helped the Brewers take a 6-0 lead off Colorado starter Chi Chi Gonzalez.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Rockies: Placed LHP Austin Gomber, who left Saturday night’s start after two innings, on the 10-day injured list with left forearm tightness and selected the contract of RHP Joe Harvey from Triple-A Albuquerque. Black said an MRI on Gomber’s arm came back clean. ... Colorado transferred RHP Jordan Sheffield to the 60-day IL to make room for Harvey. ... RHP Jon Gray (right flexor strain) tossed four innings in a rehab assignment for the Isotopes on Sunday. He could return when Colorado is in Milwaukee starting Friday.	SWING AWAY	Wong wasted no time in attacking Colorado pitchers. He swung at the first pitch in every at-bat and put the ball in play on the first three -- a single, homer and single. He fouled off the first pitch his fourth time up and flied out to center in his last at-bat.	“The first three at-bats the balls were right down the middle,” Wong said. “If they’re throwing me strikes, why not keep going? It worked out well for the first three and suffered the last two.”	All DUE RESPECT	Bard and Brewers catcher Omar Narváez had an epic 14-pitch battle for the last out of the top of the ninth. With the count full Narváez fouled off seven straight pitches before grounding out to second to end the inning.	As Bard walked toward the dugout he tipped his cap at Narvaez and gave him a fist bump as they crossed paths.	“Omar has maybe one of the best at-bats, if not the best at-bat of the day and it results in an out,” Vogelbach said. “Just impressive. Credit it to him continuing to battle.”	UP NEXT	Brewers: LHP Brett Anderson (2-4, 4.24) opens a three-game series at the struggling Arizona Diamondbacks on Monday night.	Rockies: LHP Kyle Freeland (0-2, 9.58) goes for his first win of the season at Seattle on Tuesday night. Freeland has given up nine home runs in his last three starts.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

SAN FRANCISCO -- — Wilmer Flores had four hits, including two of San Francisco’s four home runs, and the Giants routed the Philadelphia Phillies 11-2 on Sunday.	Brandon Crawford hit his 16th homer and Mike Yastrzemski combined with Flores for consecutive homers in the first off Zach Eflin (2-6). San Francisco has 107 home runs, tied with Toronto for the major league lead.	“Today I think I got a little help from the wind,” Flores said. “Honestly, our team is not looking to hit homers all the time, but that comes with good swings and good pitches that we’re swinging at.”	Sammy Long (1-0), a 25-year-old left-hander who debuted June 9, won his first major league start. Long allowed two runs and four hits in six innings with six strikeouts and one walk. He retired 10 of his final 11 batters, relying heavily on a curveball that was effective most of the afternoon.	“I didn’t have to think about it much, it was just landing for strikes,” Long said. “I know when I have that pitch I’m going to be able to get into some leverage counts easier. As the game went on (catcher Curt Casali) called it more and I trusted him.”	J.T. Realmuto homered and had three of the Phillies’ four hits. Philadelphia has lost four of six.	Eflin allowed seven runs — six earned — and nine hits in five innings. He is 0-5 in his last seven starts.	“His last start was pretty good. Today he was in the middle of the plate,” Phillies manager Joe Girardi said. “Too many mistakes in the middle of the plate. We’ve given up too many two-strike hits overall with just mistakes. If we’re going to get to the next level we have to be better at that.”	Yastrzemski hit a two-run homer in the first inning for the second straight day, Flores homered in the first and fifth to raise his season total to six, then was replaced by a pinch runner after singling in the seventh.	We expect these kind of performances from Flo,” manager Gabe Kapler said. “It’s not that we expect two home runs but we expect high quality at-bats, we expect him to be an incredibly tough out. It’s who he was last year for us last year. It’s who he’s been in his career. He’s excellent in the biggest moments.”	Crawford hit a two-run homer in the third and is five shy of his career-high of 21 set in 2015. Crawford added a two-run double in the ninth and needs four RBI to move past JT Snow for ninth in San Francisco history.	The two-time All-Star shortstop also made a defensive gem with a barehanded grab and throw on Luke Williams infield grounder in the third.	Realmuto doubled in the first, hit his seventh home run in the third and singled in the sixth.	HEATING UP AT HOME	The Giants completed a 6-1 homestand highlighted by plenty of offense. San Francisco scored five or more runs in all seven games, hit .333 (82 for 246) as a team with 19 doubles, five triples and 16 home runs.	“In the history of our park it hasn’t been a place where we’ve come to get hot,” Crawford said. “Some of it just has to do with the ups and downs of a baseball season. The last road trip we didn’t hit great collectively but it’s a game of adjustments.”	BREBBIA BACK IN THE BIGS	Just over a year after Tommy John surgery, Giants right-hander John Brebbia made a successful return to the majors and pitched a perfect ninth inning, punching the air after striking out Rafael Marchan to end the game. Brebbia, activated from the 60-day injured list before the game, underwent surgery on June 1, 2020, while with St. Louis. He signed with San Francisco six months later.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Giants: RHP Aaron Sanchez (biceps tightness) was transferred to the 60-day IL. … LHP Connor Menez was optioned to Triple-A Sacramento.	UP NEXT	Phillies: Philadelphia opens a two-game homestand against Washington on Tuesday, when RHP Zack Wheeler (5-3, 2.15 ERA) faces the Nationals for the third time this season.	Giants: RHP Anthony DeSclafani (7-2, 3.01 ERA) takes a three-game winning streak into Tuesday’s start against the Angels in Los Angeles. During the streak DeSclafani has 17 strikeouts and two walks in 20 innings.	----	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

DETROIT -- — Detroit Tigers broadcaster Jack Morris has been suspended indefinitely for racist comments he made about Los Angeles Angels star Shohei Ohtani during Tuesday's game.	When asked by play-by-play announcer Matt Shepard how the Tigers should pitch to Ohtani in the sixth inning, Morris adopted an exaggerated East Asian accent while saying “be very, very careful.” When Ohtani came back up in the ninth, Morris issued a lengthy apology.	“It’s been brought to my attention and I sincerely apologize if I offended anybody, especially in the Asian community, for what I said about pitching and being careful to Shohei Ohtani,” Morris began, before going on to talk about his respect for Ohtani's talent.	Bally Sports Detroit announced the suspension Wednesday.	“Bally Sports Detroit is extremely disappointed with the remarks analyst Jack Morris made during last night’s Tigers game,” the network said in a statement. “Jack has been suspended indefinitely from Tigers broadcasts and will be undergoing bias training to educate him on the impact of his comments and how he can be a positive influence in a diverse community. We have a zero-tolerance policy for bias or discrimination and deeply apologize for his insensitive remark.”	The Tigers, who retired Morris' number after he was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, issued a similar statement.	“The Detroit Tigers take immense pride in honoring the diverse cultures that make up our players, coaching staff, front office, fan base and community,” the team said. “We are deeply disappointed by the comments made by Jack Morris during the broadcast last night. We fully support Bally Sports Detroit’s decision and their ongoing commitment to ensure that all personnel are held to the highest standards of personal conduct.”	The incident comes 31 years after Morris, during his playing days, told a young female reporter that he “only talks to women when I'm naked if they are on top of me or I'm on top of them.” Morris, who was not naked at the time, was defended by then-team president Bo Schembechler, who blamed the Detroit Free Press for sending a female reporter into the clubhouse.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN DIEGO -- — Playing in front of mostly full stands at Petco Park has helped restore the San Diego Padres' badly bruised swagger.	The fans are thrilled to be back in full force. The Padres, who won a wild card playoff series in their empty ballpark against St. Louis in October, are happy they're returned.	Wil Myers hit a two-run triple and scored on Joey Votto’s errant throw in the third inning as the San Diego Padres beat Cincinnati 3-2 Sunday for their first four-game sweep ever against the Reds and their first four-game sweep overall since Aug. 18-21, 2011, against the Marlins.	Petco Park opened to full capacity on Thursday night, two days after the state’s reopening plan went into effect. A sellout crowd of 40,362 turned out to watch a 6-4 thriller in which the Padres hit two two-run homers in the ninth. The Padres drew big crowds for the other three games.	“The Reds are a very good team, they've been extremely hot coming in, but the most important thing I think is it was an opportunity to get in front of the fans and vice versa," manager Jayce Tingler said.	The Padres were allowed to have limited capacity earlier in the season after no fans were allowed in during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season.	The Padres regained their stride after losing 13 of their previous 17 games. They were coming off a 1-5 trip that ended with a three-game sweep at lowly Colorado.	“Coming off that long road trip, the energy in the stadium was most definitely felt," Tingler added. “It's something we can build on going forward. It was just exciting to show up at the ballpark every day and the place is rocking. You look up in the seventh, eighth, ninth inning, just kind of a quick glance at the stands. Nobody's going anywhere, everybody's anchored in and everybody was into it."	It gets bigger from here. The rival Los Angeles Dodgers come in for a three-game series starting Monday night, and the Padres expect to have star shortstop Fernando Tatis Jr. back. Tatis left Saturday's game after reinjuring his left shoulder in a 7-5 win. Tingler said Tatis would have hit if needed in the ninth inning Sunday and will be back Monday night unless he has a setback.	The Padres and Dodgers have played two entertaining series so far this season, and Petco Park should be full of raucous crowds for this one.	Second baseman Jake Cronenworth agreed with Tingler about the fans' impact.	“Honestly, I think it's the full stadium," Cronenworth said. “Credit to a bunch other things; guys having quality at-bats and great pitching, great defense, but I think that first night with the comeback in the ninth there, I think that just kind of sparked everything for the rest of the weekend."	Reds manager David Bell said he noticed the boost the fans gave the Padres.	“They're a good team, no question," Bell said. “We're a good team, so we expect to win games here, for sure. But they played well. They're a very good team and it takes our best."	Tatis watched from the dugout as his replacement, rookie Kim Ha-seong, deftly started a double play with the bases loaded to end the seventh. Kim made several other nice plays at shortstop. On Saturday, three innings after replacing Tatis, Kim hit a go-ahead, two-run homer with two outs in the eighth.	Kim ended the game with an over-the-shoulder catch of Jesse Winker's fly ball to shallow center.	“I thought he was great," Tingler said of the 25-year-old Kim, who signed as a free agent in the offseason after starring in South Korea. “I've seen him play good defense all year but today he was tested in a lot of areas and passed every test."	Right-hander Dinelson Lamet (2-2) held the Reds to four hits in five scoreless innings, struck out a season-high seven and walked one.	Mark Melancon pitched the ninth for his 21st save, tops in the big leagues.	Myers is heating up after struggling for weeks. His triple off Luis Castillo (2-10) in the third was his fifth extra-base hit in three games. He had two home runs in an 8-2 win Friday night.	Myers provided Lamet all the run support he needed in the third against Luis Castillo. Manny Machado singled with one out, Jake Cronenworth laid down a sacrifice bunt and Eric Hosmer walked before Myers tripled into the right field corner. Myers scored on Joey Votto's errant throw to third.	San Diego failed to add on in the fourth despite having runners at second and third with no outs. Kim drew a leadoff walk and hustled from first to third on Victor Caratini's single to center. But Castillo struck out Lamet and got Trent Grisham to hit into a double play.	The Reds scored twice in the eighth against Emilio Pagan, with the runs coming on groundouts after the reliever allowed Winker's leadoff single and a double by Tyler Stephenson.	UP NEXT	Reds: RHP Tyler Mahle (7-2, 3.39) is scheduled to start Monday night in the opener of a two-game series at Minnesota, which will counter with LHIP J.A. Happ (3-3, 6.12).	Padres: RHP Yu Darvish (6-2, 2.57) is scheduled to start Monday night in the opener of a three-game home series against the rival Los Angeles Dodgers, who will counter with LHP Julio Urías (9-2, 3.54).	------	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

PHOENIX -- — Albert Pujols hit a three-run homer and passed Mel Ott for 14th on the career runs list, and the Los Angeles Dodgers extended the Arizona Diamondbacks' losing streak to 17 games with a 9-8 victory Sunday.	Arizona trailed 9-2 before rallying with six runs in the eighth, when Josh Reddick, Christian Walker and Ketel Marte had run-scoring hits. Josh Rojas' inning-ending groundout against Victor Gonzalez stranded runners at the corners.	Kenley Jansen pitched a perfect ninth for his 18th save in 20 chances as Los Angeles won its sixth in a row.	Dodgers manager Dave Roberts was glad to get out of the desert with the sweep.	“Until that eighth there were a lot of positives,” Roberts said.	Arizona is approaching the longest losing streak of the wild card era, 19 games by the Kansas City Royals in 2005.	The Diamondbacks are a major league-worst 20-53 heading into a three-game home series against Milwaukee. Then they go to San Diego, trying to stop a major league record road losing streak that has stretched to 23 games.	Arizona is on the longest losing streak in team history and has lost 30 of 32 overall and 40 of 45.	“Maybe we can build off that eighth inning,” said Reddick, who had three hits and three RBI. “We went against one of the best teams in the league and got back in it. Just stay with that, come back (Monday) and switch gears on a new ballclub.”	Pujols' 673rd home run put Los Angeles ahead 4-0 against Alex Young (2-5) and raised his total to 1,860 runs, one more than Ott from 1926-47 for the New York Giants. Next up is Tris Speaker with 1,882.	The 41-year-old Pujols has 11 home runs this season and trails only Barry Bonds (762), Hank Aaron (755), Babe Ruth (714) and Alex Rodriguez (696) on the career list.	Garrett Cleavinger (2-3) got four outs in relief of Tony Gonsolin, who gave up one run and three hits in 3 2/3 innings in his third start after a stint on the injured list caused by right shoulder inflammation.	Los Angeles played in front of a crowd of 31,661 that featured many loud Dodgers fans. Los Angeles has won 10 of 12.	A.J. Pollock had three hits, including a pair of doubles, and three RBI. The former Diamondback outfielder sympathizes with his former team’s plight.	“You wouldn’t wish that on anyone,” he said. “They’re playing hard.”	BACK IN THE BIGS	INF Josh VanMeter took the roster spot vacated when RHP Kevin Ginkel was returned to the minors. “We wanted Kevin to get back into rhythm with consistent work,” manager Torey Lovullo said. VanMeter started at second on Sunday, batting leadoff, and later moved to third. Those are the positions where Lovullo said VanMeter will see the most playing time.	MILESTONE	Corbin Martin relieved Young and allowed four runs in 3 2/3 innings. Martin singled off Cleavinger for his first professional hit; he had been 0 for 5.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Diamondbacks: C Gary Varsho was recalled from Triple-A Reno, one day C Carson Kelly broke a wrist. ... Lovullo said Kelly will get a CT scan on Monday and then the team will project how long he will be out.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: LHP Julio Urías (9-2) starts Monday night at San Diego and RHP Yu Darvish (6-2) in the opener of a three-game series.	Diamondbacks: RHP Merrill Kelly (2-7) starts for Arizona and LHP Brett Anderson (2-4) for the Brewers.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SEATTLE -- — Shed Long Jr. hit a grand slam with two outs in the 10th inning, lifting the Seattle Mariners over the Tampa Bay Rays 6-2 on Sunday for a four-game sweep.	“I knew I won the game. I didn’t know it would be a grand slam off the bat,” Long said. “It was unbelievable, honestly. Unbelievable. Just a great feeling. It’s one of the coolest things you can do in baseball.”	The Rays owned the best record in the majors before their current six-game losing streak.	Long’s first homer of the season came against Diego Castillo (2-4). It was the first grand slam and game-winning home run of Long’s career.	“It was the pitch I wanted to throw, and he just connected the way he wanted to connect,” Castillo said.	Long started the season on the injured list with a stress fracture in his right shin. This was his 11th game since returning on June 7.	Dylan Moore started Seattle’s 10th with a bunt hit when Castillo’s throw to third was too late to catch designated runner Taylor Trammell, who was pinch-running for Ty France.	Trammell then got caught in a rundown between third and home on Jake Bauers’ grounder for the first out. Luis Torrens drew a walk to load the bases and Jake Fraley popped out to shallow right before Long’s shot to right field.	France and Torrens also homered for the Mariners, who have won seven of eight.	It was the first time the Rays had been swept in a four-game series since the Tigers did it in a series finishing on July 3, 2016.	The Mariners trailed in all four games, and had the game-winning run come in the final inning three times in the series, including the last two in extras.	“Every opportunity that was presented to them, it felt like they capitalized,” Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash said. “And that’s why we’re going home from this trip with no wins.”	Rafael Montero (4-2) pitched a perfect top of the 10th for the win.	Shane McClanahan kept the Mariners quiet early in one of his strongest starts. The rookie left-hander struck out eight in six innings, both career highs. He gave up three hits, with the only run coming on Torrens’ leadoff homer in the third inning, and walked one.	Marco Gonzales was also strong on the mound for Seattle, keeping the Rays scoreless through five innings before running into some trouble.	Manuel Margot had an RBI double in the sixth to tie it at 1-1. In the seventh, Brandon Lowe doubled when Fraley just missed a tough running catch at the center-field wall, and Mike Zunino followed with a double, chasing Gonzales from the game.	Gonzales allowed two runs on five hits in 6 1/3 innings, walking three and matching his season-high with six strikeouts.	“I know we’re going to celebrate this one,” Gonzales said.	STREAKING	France led off the seventh inning with his sixth homer, extending his hitting streak to nine games. Bauers has also hit in nine straight. The nine-game streaks are the longest for Seattle this season.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Mariners: France held his wrist and was visited by a trainer after a strikeout swing to end the ninth inning. He remained in the game at first base in the top of the 10th before being removed for Trammel. France had missed time with a wrist injury in May, and manager Scott Servais said he would have an MRI on Monday. … Servais said RHP Erik Swanson (right groin strain) will throw a bullpen session on Monday before likely starting a rehab assignment with Triple-A Tacoma.	UP NEXT	The Rays have Monday off before starting a six-game homestand Tuesday against Boston. Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash said before Sunday’s game he has not decided on a starter or if the Rays would utilize an opener.	Mariners: RHP Chris Flexen (6-3, 4.12 ERA) will start against the Rockies on Tuesday. Flexen set career highs with eight strikeouts and eight innings while holding the Twins scoreless in his last outing.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ATLANTA -- — Drew Smyly knows his first season with the Atlanta Braves hasn't gone as smoothly as he thought it would.	After shutting down the St. Louis Cardinals, Smyly believes he's on the right track to better consistency.	“I guess pretty up and down, you know?" he said. “I didn’t have the April I would like, but there’s five more months of the season, and I know it only takes one game to turn it around and start getting on a roll. I think I’ve battled every start and kept our team in the game most starts. I think I could’ve pitched a whole lot better."	Smyly didn’t allow a hit until the sixth inning, Ronald Acuña Jr. hit his 100th career homer and Atlanta earned a split of a day-night doubleheader with a 1-0 victory over the Cardinals on Sunday night.	In the first game, Adam Wainwright struck out 11 and pitched a three-hitter, sending the Cardinals to a 9-1 victory.	Smyly (4-3) signed an $11 million, one-year deal as a free agent in November and has largely been a disappointment for the Braves, entering with a 5.63 ERA in 11 starts.	He held the Cardinals hitless until Paul Goldschmidt reached on an infield single with two outs in the sixth. Second baseman Ozzie Albies fielded the ball in shallow right field and made a wide throw to first.	“I think I’m on the right page, on the right track, but I still think there’s a lot to get better at to keep improving," Smyly said. “It’s a long season. You just have to put in the work every start, find the rhythm, find the sync. I think that has been better over the last few starts with my body being on time, but every start is a new challenge."	Closer Will Smith pitched the seventh of the shortened doubleheader under pandemic rules, earning his 13th save in 14 chances.	Acuña, playing in his 378th game, became the sixth-quickest to reach the milestone with a shot to left-center in the third inning off Kwang Hyun Kim (1-5). It was his 19th homer, second-most in the NL.	He rejoiced when the ball cleared the fence.	“I think it was more because it gave us the lead," Acuña said through a translator. “It’s always big to hit a home run, but there’s no better feeling than to hit a home run to put your team up."	Before the sixth, Smyly allowed three baserunners — a walk of Tyler O’Neill in the second, Goldschmidt in the fourth and O’Neill again in the fourth. Luke Jackson, who entered the game with a 1.05 ERA, struck out O’Neill to end the sixth with runners on first and second.	Acuña hit his first homer in 10 games, snapping his longest drought of the season.	“The first two pitches were balls, and I knew at that point I had to pitch a strike," Kim said through a translator. “I tried to pitch a backdoor slider, but I didn’t do that. The pitch was low, so I think it was not really that bad a pitch. His swing was low, but I just regret not pitching strikes on those first two pitches."	Kim allowed three hits and one run in four innings.	In the first game, Nolan Arenado hit a two-run homer off Bryse Wilson in the first and Goldschmidt added a three-run shot off Josh Tomlin in the fifth.	The 39-year-old Wainwright (5-5) didn’t allow a hit until the fourth, when Freddie Freeman singled. It was Wainwright’s 26th career complete game, two of them this season and tying him with Justin Verlander for the most among active players.	Wainwright was proud to pitch a complete game, no matter how long it went.	“I’ll take them however they give them to me,” he said. “If the next one is a five-inning rainout, I’ll take that one, too. I like going the distance. That’s a notch on the belt. That’s what we strive to do.”	After rain postponed Saturday’s game to force the doubleheader, the Cardinals snapped a six-game road losing streak, their longest under fourth-year manager Mike Shildt.	St. Louis had scored only 10 runs in its last seven games and was held to six hits and one run in the first two games of this four-game series before breaking loose.	The Braves, who play another doubleheader Monday at the New York Mets, had dropped seven of 10 after the first game.	The Cardinals have dropped 14 of 20 after losing the second game.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Braves manager Brian Snitker had no update on the status of LHP Tucker Davidson, who avoided Tommy John surgery last week after being diagnosed with a forearm strain. “He’s in that shutdown phase where they’re just going to cool everything down for a while,” Snitker said.	STREAK STOPS	In the first game, Acuña went 0 for 3 to snap the major leagues’ longest current on-base streak at 26 straight games.	ON THE LIST	Only Ryan Howard (324 games), Gary Sánchez (355), Aaron Judge (371), Ralph Kiner (376) and Joey Gallo (377) reached 100 homers faster than Acuña.	UP NEXT	Braves RHP Ian Anderson (4-3, 3.58) and LHP Kyle Muller (0-0, 18.00) are set to start Monday’s doubleheader for Atlanta in a yet-to-be-determined order. ... The Cardinals are off Monday. Johan Oviedo will start Tuesday’s game at Detroit.	------	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- — Jacob deGrom was stopped coming off the mound after retiring the side in order in the first inning, and chuckled as he handed his glove and cap over to the umpire. The New York Mets ace then undid his belt buckle as requested, showing there was no goop there either.	This was no sticky situation for the two-time National League Cy Young Award winner, only what is going to become a new norm for all professional pitchers.	The search is on for unauthorized foreign substances that pitchers can use to doctor baseballs, long against the rules but rarely enforced until now. The crackdown began Monday when major and minor league umpires started regular checks of all pitchers for tacky substances used to get a better grip on the balls, but can also increase the spin of the balls and make hitting them more difficult.	"I said, ‘What all do you guys need?’ ‘Glove, hat and belt,’ they said. I handed them that stuff and then went along my way,” said deGrom, the first to get inspected since he was the first pitcher to take the mound on the day baseball's new enforcement directive went into effect. He started the first game of New York's home doubleheader against Atlanta.	The Mets and Braves were among 14 Major League Baseball teams scheduled to play Monday, six days after a five-page memo to teams about the pending change in enforcement that followed what baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred called an extensive process of repeated warnings without effect.	“I think I’ve seen everything in baseball, but this is new, setting a new precedent,” said Houston Astros manager Dusty Baker, in his 24th season as a big league manager after 19 seasons as a player.	Asked whether such substances were tacitly allowed in the past, Baker responded, “You just didn’t really make a fuss about it, but it was against the rules, so we’ll see.”	Rangers starter Kyle Gibson and Oakland's Frankie Montas weren't checked until after pitching in the second inning of that game in Texas. Both were smiling after getting inspected on the field, and then getting a tap on the chest from home plate umpire Dan Iassogna.	Texas manager Chris Woodward said before the game that Gibson said he has never used anything on the baseball.	“He’s kind of a unicorn nowadays ... to have a guy who is so good who doesn’t use anything,” Woodward said. “It’s probably rare.”	Manfred said last week that the enforcement of foreign substances was needed “to level the playing field” after two months of comprehensive data collection, including inspections of balls used in games and testing by third-party inspectors. That came with the league batting average at a more than a half-century low along with record strikeouts.	Fans at Citi Field booed loudly when plate umpire Ben May halted deGrom on the pitcher’s path off the field after the right-hander had two strikeouts in the first inning. After being cleared by crew chief Ron Kulpa, who had jogged in from third base to do the inspection, deGrom walked on to the dugout, laughing with catcher Tomás Nido about the exchange as the fans cheered.	Kyle Muller, who was making his first big league start for the Braves, was similarly stopped and inspected after the bottom of the first.	DeGrom appeared to ask May after the top of the second inning if he’d need to be inspected again, but May waved him on that time. He was inspected again after the fifth inning, prompting more boos from the fans while their hometown pitcher was cleared again.	“Honestly, I didn’t mind it. It was quick and it went pretty easy," deGrom said.	Any suspended players will not be replaced on a team’s active roster. Braves manager Brian Snitker emphasized that when he met with his players Sunday and discussed crackdown at length.	“I think the biggest thing we wanted to reiterate is if you get popped, we can’t replace you,” he said Monday from New York. “That’s a big deal. I think everybody’s aware of what’s going to go on and how serious it is, to not mess around and get suspended, because that’s a definite blow to your club when you got to go short like that.”	Chicago Cubs manager David Ross, a former big league catcher, was asked if hitters needed to be more careful in the batter's box now with potentially slicker baseballs.	“So the information so far in the last 10 days, batting average has gone up, on-base has gone up, (slugging percentage) has gone up. Spin rates are down on fastballs, breaking balls, and hit by pitches are exactly the same," Ross said. "So you draw your own conclusions.”	Cleveland Indians manager Terry Francona, who was not worried about any issues with his pitchers, figured that everybody around the league would be on their best behavior with everyone watching the first night.	“I’m sure there’s going to come a day when it’s a hot day and everybody’s a little irritable that something will probably happen,” Francona said. “MLB’s been pretty open that there might be a hiccup or two. But I do think for the most part, I think the majority of everybody wants the same thing. Just how you get to it some days, you know, you’re dealing with competitive people and sometimes you get your ire up a little bit or something. Something will happen, I’m sure.”	Baltimore Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said the league had been very clear and thorough about the changes and the reasons for them, and issued another memo Sunday night before they took effect to provide more clarity.	“I think it’s pretty well reported that guys for a lot of years have used things, whether it’s sunscreen or pine tar, to get a little bit better grip to command the ball for numerous reasons, whether just feel in their fingertips, etc. Obviously now we’re to a different point where guys were using stuff that was a little bit more aggressive than that,” Hyde said. “The league came down and said, ‘Listen, we’re not going to put up with any of it.’ And we’re just going to follow it and see how it goes.”	------	AP Baseball Writers Jake Seiner in New York, Noah Trister in Baltimore, and Jay Cohen in Chicago contributed to this report.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

BALTIMORE -- — Jake Odorizzi pitched five outstanding innings in another sign of progress after his arm issues, and Houston won its eighth straight game.	A no-hitter would have been nice, but the Astros have plenty of other things to feel good about.	Odorizzi and the Houston bullpen took a bid for a combined no-hitter into the eighth inning Monday night, eventually settling for a 10-2 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. Houston now leads the AL West by a game over Oakland, which lost at Texas.	The 31-year-old Odorizzi missed more than a month with a strained muscle in his right arm. This was his fifth appearance and fourth start since returning. He retired his first 13 batters before walking DJ Stewart on a full count in the fifth.	“I'm happy with the way I'm progressing,” Odorizzi said. “I knew it was going to be a process. I stuck to that process, and I feel more and more comfortable every time I'm on the mound.”	Maikel Franco hit a two-run homer with one out in the eighth off Brandon Bielak, breaking up the no-hitter. Odorizzi and reliever Cristian Javier held the Orioles without a hit through seven.	The start of the game was delayed by rain for an hour, and there was also a 41-minute rain delay during the top of the eighth. That came after the teams played for a while in a driving rain, with puddles forming in the infield.	“This grounds crew — they appear like they're used to rain delays,” Astros manager Dusty Baker said. "Every time I've been here in a three-day period, there's always been a rain delay, so I give the grounds crew a lot of credit for doing a great job.”	Bielak came on to pitch the bottom of the eighth for Houston. After he hit Austin Hays in the back of the helmet with a breaking ball — just the second baserunner for Baltimore — Franco sent a drive to deep center field.	Earlier in Franco’s at-bat, Bielak appeared to have thrown strike three, but he didn’t get the call from plate umpire Angel Hernandez.	Stevie Wilkerson followed with a single up the middle, and the Orioles finished with two hits.	Houston was looking to pitch the seventh no-hitter in the majors this season. That would have matched 1990, 1991, 2012 and 2015 for the most since 1900, one shy of the record eight in 1884 — the first season overhand pitching was allowed.	In a season when pitchers have dominated — and on the day umpires began checking them for illegal foreign substances — Odorizzi (2-3) didn’t seem the least bit bothered.

CHICAGO -- — When it comes to all the pitching injuries for the Cleveland Indians, manager Terry Francona doesn't have time to feel sorry for himself.	He has to figure out the next step for his team.	Cleveland lost another starter when Aaron Civale exited with a finger injury Monday night, but Bobby Bradley and Josh Naylor homered to lead the Indians to a 4-0 victory over the Chicago Cubs.	Civale, who leads the majors with 10 wins, left with two out in the fifth inning because of a right middle finger injury. The right-hander had a 3-2 count on Eric Sogard when he was visited by Francona and a trainer.	“The tip of his finger was bothering him, so we didn't mess around with that,” Francona said. “We just got him out of there.”	Francona said the team wants to have Civale see hand specialist Dr. Thomas Graham as soon as possible. Any prolonged absence for the 26-year-old pitcher would be a big blow for Cleveland, already missing ace Shane Bieber and right-hander Zach Plesac due to injuries.	“Rather than feel sorry for ourselves, we'll just try to figure it out the best we can,” Francona said.	Naylor finished with two hits as the Indians improved to 2-2 on a nine-game road trip. They moved within two games of the idle White Sox for the top spot in the AL Central.	Chicago lost for the sixth time in eight games, and Javier Báez was pulled by manager David Ross after the shortstop made an embarrassing mental mistake. Adbert Alzolay (4-6) permitted three runs over 4 2/3 innings in his return from the 10-day injured list after being sidelined by a blister on his right middle finger.	With one out in the fourth and Báez aboard after a fielder's choice, Anthony Rizzo hit a fly ball to left field. Báez thought there were two outs and was almost to third when he was doubled off first base, leading to a round of boos from the crowd of 32,934 at Wrigley Field.	“We've just got to make sure we're focused and locked in during the game,” Ross said, “and sometimes our frustrations can distract us a little bit. We had a good conversation and I think that's behind us.”	Báez said he respects Ross' decision.	“I blame it on myself. I lost the count of the outs,” he said. “We talked about it. We are on the same page, and I'll be there tomorrow to help the team.”	Sergio Alcántara replaced Báez in the field and was unable to throw out Harold Ramirez on an infield single leading off the fifth. After Bradley bounced into a fielder's choice, Naylor hit a drive to right-center for a two-run homer  on the ninth pitch of his at-bat, making it 3-0.	“I was just trying to be as patient as I could and foul off as many as I could just to get ready for that right one,” Naylor said.	Bradley connected in the second, and the Indians added another run in the eighth when Cesar Hernandez scampered home on a wild pitch by Tommy Nance.	After Civale was removed, Bryan Shaw (2-2) got four outs for the win. Nick Wittgren worked out of a jam in the seventh before Emmanuel Clase and James Karinchak each pitched an inning, finishing a six-hitter.	“The bullpen came in, and it was just kind of like a regular day for them,” Naylor said. “They just came in and did business.”	MAKING MOVES	Cubs reliever Kyle Ryan was optioned to Triple-A Iowa to make room for Alzolay.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: DH Franmil Reyes (left oblique strain) is scheduled to begin a rehab stint with Triple-A Columbus on Tuesday. Francona said Reyes will be re-evaluated when the team returns home after its road trip. ... Plesac (broken right thumb) threw fastballs, changeups and sliders during a 30-pitch bullpen. He did not throw any curveballs. ... Cs Roberto Perez (broken right ring finger) and Austin Hedges (concussion list) ran the bases and hit on the field before the game. ... 3B José Ramírez (bruised left foot) returned to the starting lineup for the first time since he was hit by a pitch during Friday night's 11-10 loss at Pittsburgh. He popped out in a pinch-hit appearance on Sunday.	Cubs: LHP Justin Steele (right hamstring strain) will throw another bullpen pretty soon, according to Ross. “Things are good,” the manager said. “He'll be off on a kind of rehab soon.” ... RHP Trevor Williams (appendectomy) will travel with the team to Los Angeles when it heads out on a 10-game trip this week. “If everything's going well, he'll be off to build up some innings soon, too,” Ross said.	UP NEXT	Cubs right-hander Kyle Hendricks (9-4, 4.13 ERA) goes for his eighth straight win Tuesday night. Hendricks is 4-0 with a 2.96 ERA in June. Rookie right-hander Eli Morgan (0-1, 12.79 ERA) makes his third big league start for the Indians.	------	Jay Cohen can be reached at https://twitter.com/jcohenap	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- — Kyle Gibson couldn't really get comfortable on the mound, and that had nothing to do with new mandatory checks by umpires looking for foreign substances.	“I’ve only used rosin pitching my whole life. So they said, 'Hey, nothing looks sticky here, let’s move on,” said Gibson, who pitched into the sixth inning to help the Rangers end another losing streak.	Andy Ibañez and Jose Trevino hit three-run homers to back Gibson as the Rangers snapped a six-game losing streak with an 8-3 win over the Oakland Athletics and Elvis Andrus in the shortstop's return to Texas for the first time since getting traded. It was the fourth time this season the veteran right-hander started a win that ended a losing streak of at least three games for his team.	“That third inning, just kind of felt like I was fighting myself all night after that and I was just trying to find a pitch I could throw for a strike,” Gibson said. “Just one of those weird nights, probably the first time in a while that I didn’t feel comfortable with my delivery, didn’t feel comfortable with where the ball was going.”	Ibañez hit his first major league homer as part of a five-run first against Frankie Montas (7-7). The 28-year-old Cuban infielder made his big league debut last month and was recalled Monday after four homers his last nine games at Triple-A Round Rock.	Trevino hit a 420-foot drive to straightaway center for an 8-2 lead in the sixth, one batter before Montas was pulled.	“Playing with a five-run lead right from he beginning kind of puts everybody at ease a little bit. And you have your best guy on the mound,” manager Chris Woodward said. “That probably wasn’t obviously Gibby’s best start, but he still found a way to to get us into the sixth inning."	Andrus got a nice ovation when he came to bat in the second inning. It kept getting louder, and he eventually stepped out of the batter’s box with a smile on his face and tipped his helmet to the crowd.	“No surprise that he got the type of reception that he did. Monday night, good crowd, probably a lot had to do with Elvis coming back to town and playing. I think we all got a little choked up too," A's manager Bob Melvin said. “He’s meant so much to this city and this team and been with them so long.”	Many in the announced crowd of 20,259 got Andrus bobbleheads when entering the building. Those were initially part of planned giveaways last year that never happened since the Rangers played the 2020 season without fans in their new ballpark because of the coronavirus pandemic.	Andrus was traded just before spring training after deciding last offseason that Isiah-Kiner Falefa would move to shortstop after winning a Gold Glove at third base last season. Andrus was the longest-tenured player in Texas, the starting shortstop for 12 seasons and lone player remaining from the franchise’s only World Series appearances in 2010 and 2011.	Andrus, hitting .220 after going 0 for 4, reached on an error by Kiner-Falefa in the eighth but was promptly retired when Sean Murphy hit a liner right at first baseman Nate Lowe, who turned and tagged out Andrus for a double play.	Gibson (5-0, 2.17 ERA) struck out three and walked three giving up two runs over 5 1/3 innings. The right-hander has made 15 consecutive starts without a losing decision, though that streak includes his first career opening day start, when the Rangers had its only other five-run first this season. Gibson then gave up five runs while recording only one out in the bottom of the first at Kansas City.	Since that opener, Gibson has given up more than two runs in a start only once.	The A's had a couple of two-out walks before getting a hit off Gibson, on Murphy's one-out solo homer in the fifth. Matt Olson and Ramón Laureano had back-to-back doubles to open the sixth.	Montas struck out six, but gave up eight runs and nine hits in 5 2/3 innings.	“It was really humid, I got sweat all on my palms," Montas said. “That made the ball slippery.”	SHORT HOPS	Murphy has eight homers overall, three in the last six games. ... Texas had at least multiple homers driving in at least three runs in the game game for only the third time since the start of the 2019 season.	RETURN FOR ELVIS	The Rangers got outfielder/designated hitter Khris Davis and switch-hitting catcher Jonah Heim from the A's in the Andrus deal. Davis is now a free agent after being designated for assignment June 8. He hit .157 with two homers and five RBI in 22 games after missing the first 34 games of the season with a left quad strain. Heim has started 28 games.	UP NEXT	The Rangers said afterward that Taylor Hearn (2-1, 2.84) would start Tuesday instead of Jordan Lyles (2-5, 5.68 ERA), who gave up four home runs over 4 1/3 innings in his last start. The Rangers haven't won consecutive games since sweeping three games against Houston from May 21-23. Lefty Cole Irvin (4-7, 3.89) is on the mound for Oakland.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

NEW YORK -- — Jacob deGrom put Mets fans at ease with a bevy of triple-digit heaters.	Hopefully clear of the arm woes that interrupted his past two starts, the two-time NL Cy Young Award winner is back to dominating hitters — and the record books.	DeGrom shouldered the load for New York in his return from another injury scare, pitching one-hit ball over five scoreless innings as the Mets beat the Atlanta Braves 4-2 Monday to open a doubleheader.	Braves closer Will Smith loaded the bases in the nightcap's seventh inning but escaped for his 14th save in a 1-0 win. Ronald Acuña Jr. hit his 20th homer, and Ian Anderson became the first native New Yorker to beat the Mets and Yankees in New York in the same season.	DeGrom didn’t allow a hit in the seven-inning opener until Mets outfielders misplayed a fly ball with two outs in the fifth, letting it fall for a ground-rule double. DeGrom threw 70 pitches, 15 of them over 100 mph, with two walks and six strikeouts.	“Felt good,” deGrom said. “I think that’s why we decided at that 70-pitch mark to say that was enough, didn’t want to overdo it.”	Jeff McNeil came off the injured list and singled as a pinch-hitter for deGrom (7-2) during New York’s three-run fifth inning. He scored on Dominic Smith’s three-run double.	Ozzie Albies hit a two-run homer off Seth Lugo in Game 1 for the Braves, who had won three of four but were playing their second doubleheader in two days — they also split that one, winning the nightcap against St. Louis 1-0 on a homer by Acuña.	Left-hander Kyle Muller (0-1) pitched one-hit ball over four innings in the opener, leaving with a 1-0 deficit in his first big league start.	“He threw the ball extremely well,” Atlanta manager Brian Snitker said. “Had a good breaking ball, kept his composure, everything was really good.”	Mets closer Edwin Díaz finished a two-hitter in Game 1, pitching the seventh for his 15th save in 16 chances.	Mets sparkplug Jonathan Villar left the second game with right calf tightness after leading off the sixth with a double, one of several health-related setbacks for New York. Villar will be re-evaluated Tuesday.	DeGrom has thrown 30 consecutive scoreless innings, 2 2/3 shy of R.A. Dickey’s franchise mark set in 2012.	He topped Hall of Famer Bob Gibson's record with his 12th consecutive start allowing no more than one run. His 0.50 ERA is the lowest by a pitcher through 12 starts in major league history. Opponents are hitting .113 against him, the lowest average against any pitcher in a 12-game span since at least 1901, with a minimum 70 innings.	Two days after his 33rd birthday, deGrom came out firing in his first start since his previous two outings were cut short by arm trouble. The right-hander was pulled after three perfect innings against the Cubs last Wednesday with shoulder soreness, and he left the outing prior to that June 11 against San Diego with flexor tendinitis in his right arm.	DeGrom has thrown 154 pitches at least 100 mph this season, most in baseball among starting pitchers — Tampa Bay’s Shane McClanahan was second entering Monday with 14.	“He’s on another level,” Snitker said.	NIGHTCAP RECAP	In the second game, Jerad Eickhoff gave New York four scoreless innings in his first big league appearance since June 16, 2019 with Philadelphia, but Miguel Castro (2-2) allowed Acuña's leadoff shot in the fifth.	Anderson (5-3) pitched 5 1/3 scoreless innings, striking out five. Raised in Clifton Park, the right-hander became the first native of the state to beat two New York teams in the Big Apple in a season since Philadelphia’s Jim Konstanty and Chicago’s Turk Lown both defeated the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants in 1953.	“It's always nice to come home and pitch, and I've had some good success doing it,” Anderson said.	Smith allowed two hits and a walk with one out in the seventh. Braves third baseman Austin Riley — who made two diving stops in the opener — nearly ended the late game when he dived to catch Kevin Pillar's liner. Riley sprawled to touch third as Pete Alonso retreated to tag up. Umpires called Alonso out, but that ruling was overturned via replay review.	Brandon Drury popped up to second base for the final out.	The Mets have 13 runs in their last seven games. They threatened in the sixth but Jose Peraza and Francisco Lindor each got thrown out carelessly on the bases.	STICKING TO THE PLAN	DeGrom was the first pitcher inspected as part of Major League Baseball's crackdown on foreign substances. He passed.	“Honestly, I didn't mind it,” deGrom said. “It was quick and it went pretty easy.”	DO-IT-ALL ACUÑA	Acuña’s homer was measured at 115.7 mph. He also threw out Alonso at third base from right field in the second inning with a throw clocked at 97.3 mph.	“That throw was unbelievable,” Anderson said. “You almost come to expect it now. He can do it all. That home run was one of the most impressive I've ever seen."	LEFT OUT	An MRI revealed that Mets left-hander Joey Lucchesi tore the ulnar collateral ligament in his pitching elbow. New York is seeking a second opinion, but Tommy John surgery is a strong possibility.	Acting general manager Zack Scott said last week the Mets would seek upgrades via trade for their top-heavy rotation. Lucchesi's loss could hasten that search. The 28-year-old was 1-4 with a 4.46 ERA but had a 1.19 ERA in his last five starts.	“It's a big loss for us,” Rojas said. “A talented young kid that I think is just getting better every time he goes out there.”	Mets starters have a 2.63 ERA, best in the majors.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: McNeil hadn’t played since May 16 because of a left hamstring strain. He was 0 for 3 in Game 2. ... C Tomás Nido was hit on the right wrist by a pitch in the opener and was replaced a half-inning later by James McCann. X-rays were negative. ... RHP Robert Gsellman was placed on the 10-day injured list with a right lat strain. ... RHP Jeurys Familia was added to the 10-day injured list between games with a right hip impingement. ... LHP Stephen Tarpley was recalled from Triple-A Syracuse as New York’s 27th man for the twinbill.	Braves: Muller was Atlanta's 27th man.	UP NEXT	Braves RHP Ian Anderson (4-3, 3.58) could become the first New Yorker to beat the Yankees and Mets in the same season when he starts the nightcap. Mets RHP Jerad Eickhoff will start for his first appearance this season.	------	Follow Jake Seiner: https://twitter.com/Jake--Seiner	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

MINNEAPOLIS -- — The longest game in the major leagues this year left the Minnesota Twins feeling emotionally spent.	Their best winning streak of the season is still going, but center fielder Byron Buxton has been sidelined once again.	Miguel Sanó hit a two-run homer in the 12th inning to lift Minnesota past Cincinnati 7-5 on Monday night — the fifth straight victory for the Twins and fifth loss in a row for the Reds.	With a runner on third and Cincinnati playing a five-man infield, Sanó hammered a 3-1 slider from Heath Hembree (1-3) over the wall in left-center. It was Minnesota's fourth consecutive extra-innings win after eight straight losses in extras to start the season.	“Just trying to find one pitch that’s really good and trying to hit it,” Sanó said.	The game lasted 5:14 and ended 30 minutes past midnight, after beginning on a somber note with a remembrance of the late Mike Bell — the former Reds player and Twins coach who died of cancer this year. Bell was the younger brother of Cincinnati manager David Bell.	After being hit by a 94 mph fastball from Reds starter Tyler Mahle in the fourth, Buxton played one more inning before being pulled — and diagnosed with a broken left hand. He could miss a month or so, a crushing blow to an oft-injured player who missed 40 games with a strained right hip before returning to action on Saturday.	“This isn’t fair. That’s how I feel about the whole thing,” Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said.	Matt Shoemaker (3-8), whose struggles as a starter prompted a recent demotion to the bullpen, pitched two hitless innings for the win. Shoemaker loaded the bases in the 12th after two walks, one intentional, but struck out Eugenio Suárez — who had a homer and three RBI — to escape.	“It's definitely an adjustment being used to starting, but that's where I am and I'm going to own it and do my best and be great at it,” Shoemaker said.	The late innings were quite the testament to endurance and resilience, with a bit of unstable relief pitching mixed in — and stranded runners galore.	Nick Castellanos, in a 5-for-26 slide, gave the Reds the lead with a single in the 10th against Jorge Alcala for his first RBI in eight games. Suárez, who had an earlier two-run homer, added a sacrifice fly to turn the game over to Sean Doolittle.	The left-hander gave up an RBI double to Luis Arraez and a sacrifice fly to Trevor Larnach as the Twins sent a game to the 11th inning for the first time this season. They're 3-8 in 10-inning games.	Taylor Rogers allowed two hits to Cincinnati in the ninth, but Jonathan India — who was picked off first base in the seventh — over-slid second as he went headfirst for a double and was tagged for the second out. Rogers struck out Jesse Winker to strand a runner at third.	Minnesota loaded the bases against Lucas Sims in the bottom of the inning, but he struck out Ryan Jeffers looking on a 96 mph full-count fastball that caught the lower outside corner. Sims then retired Andrelton Simmons on a forceout.	IN MEMORY	The Twins held a pregame remembrance for Mike Bell, their well-liked bench coach for the 2020 season who died at age 46 on March 26 of kidney cancer.	David Bell caught the ceremonial first pitch from Mike Bell's widow, Kelly Bell. The Twins presented the Bell family a signed jersey and a $10,000 donation to a local organization, GiGi's Playhouse, that works for Down syndrome advocacy and support. David Bell's voice cracked as he addressed the crowd with appreciation.	“They did an amazing job, they really did, of putting together something so thoughtful. It says a lot about Mike and who he was and how much he meant to people here, but it also says a lot about the people here with the Twins. So many nice gestures. So many nice gifts,” David Bell said afterward.	BACK TO BACK	Suárez and Aristides Aquino hit consecutive home runs in the fourth inning against J.A. Happ to bring the Reds back from a 3-0 hole that was started by Nelson Cruz’s homer. Happ is 1/3 with a 9.33 ERA over his last eight starts, with 58 hits and 11 home runs allowed in 36 2/3 innings.	HEADS-UP PLAY	Alex Kirilloff singled for the Twins in the eighth and simply ran to an empty second base — the rookie’s first career steal — while the Reds nonchalantly prepared for the next batter. The Twins wound up leaving the bases loaded to end that inning.	SUMMER CRUZ	Cruz has reached base at least once in all 16 games he's appeared in this month, with six homers, 13 RBI and 10 walks.	Mahle labored through a 38-pitch second inning. Kirilloff's RBI single and Arraez's sacrifice fly followed Cruz's homer. Larnach whiffed with the bases loaded to end the rally. He took three of the eight strikeouts by Mahle, who lasted only four innings.	COME BACK REAL SOON	The Reds went 17 years without any trips to Minnesota in the scheduling quirk of all scheduling quirks, including the first eight seasons of Target Field's existence. Now they've visited the Twins three times in four years. The all-time series is tied at 14.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: RHP Tejay Antone (right forearm inflammation), the team's top reliever, will be strongly considered for activation from the injured list on Tuesday.	Twins: 3B Josh Donaldson (right calf tightness) was out of the starting lineup for the fourth straight game but entered as a pinch-hitter in the eighth.	UP NEXT	Reds: LHP Wade Miley (6-4, 2.88 ERA) will take the mound Tuesday afternoon. He has allowed two earned runs or fewer in 10 of his 12 turns this season.	Twins: RHP Bailey Ober (0-0, 3.71 ERA) will pitch to wrap up the two-game series. The rookie has made four starts, with 21 strikeouts in 17 innings and only two walks.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

PHOENIX -- — Ketel Marte camped under the high fly ball in center field and watched as it fell into his glove. Relief pitcher Joakim Soria smacked his hands together, grinned and walked toward catcher Stephen Vogt, who pumped his arms in a little victory dance.	The Arizona Diamondbacks had finally won a baseball game, ending three weeks and 17 games of misery.	“Sheer joy,” Vogt said. “We’ve been working so hard, fighting, clawing.”	Merrill Kelly pitched seven effective innings and Marte had two hits as the Diamondbacks beat the Milwaukee Brewers 5-1 on Monday night. Vogt described the postgame clubhouse scenes of victory that have been missing over the past few weeks: Music blaring, lots of laughing and high-fives.	“It’s definitely more fun winning than losing," Kelly said.	The win was a long time coming for Arizona, which has plunged to the bottom of the standings in the NL West and has the worst record in the majors at 21-53. It was the first victory for the Diamondbacks since they beat the Mets 6-5 in 10 innings on June 1.	The 17-game skid was two shy of the longest during the wild-card era, by the Kansas City Royals in 2005.	Kelly (3-7) — the only Diamondbacks starting pitcher who has stayed reasonably healthy all season — had one of his best outings of the year. The right-hander needed just 94 pitches to navigate his seven innings, giving up one run, five hits and a walk with five strikeouts.	“He had a great day," Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said. “He gave us seven unbelievable innings. There was limited trouble. He was making his pitches.”	Kelly said it was hard to get away from the negativity over the past three weeks as the losses piled up. He added that the Diamondbacks are all professionals and take their jobs seriously, so not seeing results was tough.	“A lot of our wives and girlfriends are saints for putting up with us,” Kelly said grinning.	The night didn't start well for the D-backs, who fell behind in the first inning after Avisail Garcia lined a two-out RBI single through the infield.	Arizona got three runs in the second, when seven straight batters reached base on six singles and one walk. The Diamondbacks pushed ahead 5-1 in the fourth after Josh Rojas sliced an opposite-field RBI double to left and Marte scored on a groundout. The margin held and Soria worked a scoreless ninth to secure the win.	“You have no idea what’s happening in our clubhouse on a daily basis and the pain we’ve been feeling," Lovullo said. "It’s a good feeling to know we did things the right way and won a baseball game.”	The Diamondbacks started the season 15-13 but have had a rough time for nearly two months. Even with Monday's win, they're just 6-40 since May 2. They've also got one more dubious losing streak to end: They've dropped 23 straight games on the road, the longest skid in modern-day MLB history.	Arizona's next chance to end that streak is on Friday in San Diego.	EARLY EXIT	Milwaukee starting pitcher Brett Anderson (2-5) left in the second inning because of right knee discomfort. Anderson had given up five straight hits before the injury. He allowed three earned runs over 1 1/3 innings.	Anderson said the injury occurred when he grounded into a double play in the top of the second.	“I jammed it on the double play when I hit (the base) and then it got progressively worse and worse in the second," he said.	ROSTER MOVES	Brewers: RHP Zack Godley was designated for assignment after making two appearances. He gave up six earned runs over 3 1/3 innings. RHP Jake Cousins' contract was selected from Triple-A Nashville.	Diamondbacks: Placed RHP Matt Peacock on the bereavement list. RHP Humberto Castellanos was recalled from Triple-A Reno to take his place.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: INF Eduardo Escobar has a strain in his right quadriceps and didn't start. Lovullo said Escobar was available off the bench. ... C Carson Kelly (fractured right wrist) will head to the team's training site in Scottsdale to begin treatment. Lovullo said there was no timetable for his return. ... LHP Madison Bumgarner (shoulder inflammation) threw a 20-pitch bullpen. ... RHP J.B. Bukaskas (elbow strain) and RHP Taylor Widener (groin strain) will throw batting practice Tuesday.	UP NEXT	The Diamondbacks will send RHP Zac Gallen (1-2, 3.99 ERA) to the mound to face Brewers RHP Freddy Peralta (6-2, 2.28) on Tuesday night. It is Gallen's second start since returning from a strained elbow.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

SAN DIEGO -- — Yu Darvish said he never envisioned himself as an ace until recently.	Well, nothing says it more than 1,500 strikeouts in 197 career starts.	Darvish struck out 11 in six brilliant innings to become the fastest big leaguer to reach 1,500 for his career, Manny Machado and Jake Cronenworth homered and the San Diego Padres beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 6-2 on Monday night in the opener of a three-game series between the NL West rivals.	“Since I’ve come here I’ve had my ups and downs, but the reason why I’m sitting here being able to talk about reaching 1,500 strikeouts is definitely because of all the support I have been given since I started my career here,” said Darvish, who came to the majors in 2012 after spending seven seasons in his native Japan.	“Just from the bottom of my heart I’m really thankful and grateful for all the support I’ve been given through the years," said Darvish, who turns 35 on Aug. 16.	Darvish (7-2) reached 1,500 strikeouts on the nose in 197 starts. He held the Dodgers to two hits, including Mookie Betts’ solo homer, and walked just one.	The Padres improved to 5-3 this season against the Dodgers.	Darvish pitched for the Dodgers in the second half of 2017, including the World Series loss to Houston. He was obtained by the Padres in a trade with the Chicago Cubs on Dec. 29.	“I like the Dodgers as a team,” Darvish said. “I get excited facing this team so maybe there’s a little more adrenaline I would say, yes.”	After playing two entertaining series before limited-capacity crowds, this was the first time this season the teams faced each other in a full-capacity ballpark after California's reopening plan went into effect last week. The sellout crowd of 42,220 appeared to be fairly evenly split between Dodgers and Padres fans.	The Dodgers swept the Padres in their NL Division Series last year en route to the World Series title.	Darvish's only big mistake was allowing Betts' homer to center with two outs in the third, his ninth. That ended a string of seven straight strikeouts for the right-hander.	Darvish notched his milestone 1,500th strikeout when he got Steven Souza Jr. looking leading off the sixth. After Cronenworth's error at first base allowed Gavin Lux to reach with two outs, Darvish allowed just his second hit, a single by Justin Turner.	Rookie second baseman Kim Ha-seong then made a nice play on Will Smith's hard smash to end the inning, although he injured the index finger on his throwing hand and was replaced by Cronenworth the next inning. Padres manager Jayce Tingler said X-rays on Kim's finger were negative.	Tingler said Darvish being the quickest to 1,500 strikeouts “is unbelievably impressive. Obviously you have to be able to do that in a short period of time. For him to do everything with those strikeouts over the years, he’s got a ton of weapons. The way he spins the ball, the way he manipulates the ball, being able to get swing and miss, he’s tremendous at it.”	Darvish is known for a wide variety of breaking pitches as well as his firm fastball.	“He's one of the best at just manipulating the baseball and getting it to do different things. That's certainly a big factor in getting as many punchouts in a pretty short amount of time," Tingler said.	Machado hit a three-run homer off Julio Urías (9-3) to give the Padres a 4-0 lead before the Dodgers got an out in the first. Urías allowed Tommy Pham's leadoff double, walked Fernando Tatis Jr. and allowed Cronenworth's opposite-field double to left before Machado drove his 11th homer to left.	Cronenworth homered to right in the fifth after Tatis hit a leadoff double to left. It was Cronenworth's ninth.	Will Smith homered off San Diego reliever Craig Stammen in the eighth, his ninth.

MINNEAPOLIS -- — The Cincinnati Reds didn't look drained to manager David Bell, despite this recent slide.	The boss was right, because the Reds had plenty of energy left for a late surge against Minnesota after the Twins took a game of back-and-forth rallies the night before.	Tyler Naquin went 4 for 4 with a three-run homer that broke a ninth-inning tie right after the ragged Cincinnati bullpen lost a five-run lead, and the Reds beat the Twins 10-7 to stop their five-game losing streak on Tuesday afternoon.	Amir Garrett got his fourth save in six chances with a scoreless ninth after fellow relievers Art Warren, Lucas Sims and Tejay Antone stumbled through a five-run eighth for Minnesota, which had its season-long five-game winning streak end.	“We keep pulling for each other, keep showing up, keep playing hard,” said Naquin, who joined the Reds in February on a minor league contract.	Max Kepler hit a two-run homer, Trevor Larnach added a solo shot and Alex Kirilloff had the tying two-run double off Antone (2-0), but the right-hander in his first game back from the injured list recovered to record the last two outs of the inning.	Tucker Barnhart homered and had three RBI and Jesse Winker hit a two-run double for the Reds, whose relief ERA (5.70) is the worst in the major leagues. Injuries have made an impact on that, to be sure, and Bell did not sound bothered by the way he's seen his relievers throw the ball lately.	“There’s no question we’re just going to keep getting better. There’s been signs along the way,” he said. “I love the way the guys are approaching it.”	After grinding through a 12-inning victory on Monday night that lasted 5 hours, 14 minutes, the longest in MLB this year, the Twins experienced some bullpen problems of their own.	Alex Colomé allowed three runs in the eighth, though third baseman Miguel Sanó's second fielding error of the game made two of them unearned.	Then Hansel Robles (3-4), who has been one of the team's steadiest relief options, put himself in trouble with a one-out double by Nick Castellanos and by hitting Tyler Stephenson with a pitch before Naquin's 12th homer of the season gave the Reds a reason to smile on the way home.	“What a season he's having,” Bell said. “He's really settling in, and his talent is coming out.”	Wade Miley gave the Reds another strong start, too, with two runs allowed on a homer by Ryan Jeffers over seven otherwise-easy innings. Jeffers was the catcher for all 12 innings of the marathon game on Monday and returned to his crouch behind the plate again on Tuesday, as the Twins tried to shake off the bad news of star center fielder Byron Buxton's broken left hand.	“I’ll give credit to Miley. He’s been throwing the ball very well. He was just very sharp. He’s a veteran pitcher who can do a lot of tricky things,” Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said.	GETAWAY GUY	Miley, who has given up two earned runs in 11 of 13 starts this season, was exactly the pitcher the Reds wanted on the mound for this wrapup to a nine-game road trip. He's a quick worker who made a particular attempt to keep the pace on a day when he knew his position players would be tired.	“It’s picking up the boys. That’s what we do,” said Miley, who threw 94 pitches without a walk.	OBER	Twins rookie Bailey Ober made his fifth start without a decision. He lasted 4 1/3 innings with four runs allowed.	“They had some good swings on him,” Baldelli said. “He probably left a few pitches where he didn’t want them.”	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: Starting pitchers Sonny Gray (right groin) and Jeff Hoffman (right shoulder) have been scheduled for rehab assignments. Gray is expected to rejoin the Reds next week after making one three-inning start for Triple-A Louisville. ... Antone (right forearm) was activated from the 10-day injured list before the game, and OF Scott Heineman was sent to Triple-A Louisville.	Twins: With Buxton out, Gilberto Celestino returned from Triple-A St. Paul to play CF. Regular RF Max Kepler could also fill in there again, rebuilding stamina after missing time to a hamstring injury.	UP NEXT	Reds: Following a day off on Wednesday, RHP Tony Santillan (0-1, 4.70 ERA) will take the mound to begin a four-game series against Atlanta on Thursday night.	Twins: After a day off on Wednesday, RHP José Berríos (7-2, 3.56 ERA) will pitch to open a four-game series against Cleveland on Thursday night. The Twins have won seven straight Berríos starts.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

PITTSBURGH -- — Pinch-hitter Erik Gonzalez’s two-run single highlighted a four-run rally in the seventh inning as the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the skidding Chicago White Sox 6-3 on Tuesday night.	A three-run homer by pinch-hitter Yasmani Grandal in the top of the seventh put the White Sox ahead 3-2 after they were held scoreless on two hits through six innings.	But the Pirates answered in the bottom half against rookie reliever Garrett Crochet (2-4), who was charged with four runs without getting an out.	Gonzalez’s hit put Pittsburgh ahead 5-3 and helped extend Chicago’s losing streak to five games, the longest of the season for the AL Central leaders. The Pirates have won three of four since a 10-game losing streak.	“We haven’t had a lot of luck the last few weeks in getting the big hit,” second baseman Adam Frazier said. “It seems like the other teams get a big hit and we don’t answer. Maybe this will get the ball rolling a little bit.”	The White Sox are rolling in the wrong direction. They were swept in a four-game series at Houston last weekend, getting outscored 27-8 by the Astros.	“It’s kind of like a test right now,” starting pitcher Lucas Giolito said. “Rough series (in Houston) and we drop this first game. Maybe a little wakeup call we need. We have to come ready to play from the beginning of the game.	“We have to try to learn from these last few days. Come out maybe a little more aggressive, hair on fire tomorrow and get back on track.”	Frazier homered for the Pirates, and Bryan Reynolds had two hits and two RBI.	David Bednar (1-1) got the last out of the seventh for his first major league win. Richard Rodriguez earned his ninth save in 11 tries with a 1-2-3 ninth as the Pirates won for the third time in four games.	Grandal’s home run off starting pitcher Tyler Anderson was his 11th of the season and fourth as a pinch-hitter in his 10-year career. The lead didn’t last long after Giolito was removed for a pinch-hitter later in the inning.	Greogry Polanco and Phillip Evans hit back-to-back singles to start the Pittsburgh seventh. Kevin Newman then beat out a bunt for a single and Polanco scored the tying run when third baseman Yoan Moncada made a wide throw to first for an error.	“It was intended to be a sacrifice but it was placed better than I intended and I got on base so it was a win-win,” Newman said.	Gonzalez followed by grounding his go-ahead single into left field. Reynolds added an RBI single later in the inning to make it 6-3.	Anderson allowed three runs and five hits in 6 1/3 innings with four strikeouts and one walk. In six innings, Giolito gave up two runs on four hits while striking out seven and walking two.	Giolito threw a no-hitter against the Pirates last season in Chicago.	“We did not allow him to get easy outs all game long,” Pirates manager Derek Shelton said. “We really battled. It’s a testament to our guys. This is a guy that no-hit us and we made him work the entire game.”	Frazier helped the Pirates take a 2-0 lead. He hit a solo home run in the third and walked and scored on Reynolds’ single in the sixth.	WHITE SOX LOSE ENGEL	White Sox outfielder Adam Engel went back on the injured list with a strained right hamstring. He missed the first 58 games of the season because of a similar injury.	Engel and Brian Goodwin had been splitting time in center field over the past 10 days. Luis Robert, the team’s regular center fielder and last year’s AL Rookie of the Year runner-up, has been out since May 3 with a strained right hip flexor.	In 10 games, Engel is hitting .241 with three home runs. There is no timetable for his return.	“An amateur’s guess, I’d say it’s going to be more than 10 days,” manager Tony La Russa said. “I’m disappointed for him and for us. He’s come back with a bang and done a lot of really good things.”	Outfielder Luis Gonzalez was recalled from Triple-A Charlotte.	BUSY BUCCOS	Tuesday began a stretch in which the Pirates are scheduled to play on 20 consecutive days leading up to the All-Star break.	Shelton said the Pirates are likely to call up some pitchers from the minor leagues to make spot starts in the coming days. That would give the regular members of the rotation extra rest and afford the rebuilding Pirates a chance to look at some of their prospects.	TRAINER’S ROOM	White Sox: RHP Michael Kopech (strained left hamstring) threw a bullpen and is expected to pitch a simulated game Friday. … OF Billy Hamilton (strained right oblique) is likely to start swinging a bat this weekend.	UP NEXT	White Sox RHP Dylan Cease (5-3, 3.99 ERA) is scheduled to face RHP Chase DeJong (0-1, 4.26) on Wednesday in the finale of the two-game series. Cease is 2/3 with a 6.89 ERA in seven road starts this season.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

BALTIMORE -- — Dusty Baker has been around long enough to know what it takes for a team to get on a lengthy winning streak.	After watching Zack Greinke stymie the Baltimore Orioles on Tuesday night for Houston's ninth straight victory, Baker was asked to explain the reason behind the Astros' most successful run since the 2019 season.	“We're getting good starting pitching,” the longtime manager declared. “That’s where it starts.”	Greinke took a four-hitter into the eighth inning and Myles Straw had two RBI in Houston's gritty 3-1 win. One night earlier, starter Jake Odorizzi pitched five hitless innings to spark a 10-2 rout of the lowly Orioles.	Greinke (8-2) allowed one run and five hits with four strikeouts and a walk over 7 1/3 innings. Facing the Orioles for the first time since 2010, the 37-year-old righty permitted only one runner past second base in lowering his ERA to 3.56.	The 18-year veteran attributed his solid outing to re-discovering his command of the fastball.	“It hasn’t been that great,” Greinke acknowledged. “I can’t remember when it was good. It's been a while.”	On this night, he was overpowering.	“The guy knows how to pitch,” Orioles outfielder DJ Stewart said. “He's been getting outs and doing this for a long, long time. He keeps you off balance with fastball, curveball, changeup.”	Brooks Raley got two strikeouts in the eighth and Ryan Pressly finished for his 11th save in 12 tries.	Straw hit a  solo shot  in the second inning and singled in the tiebreaking run in the seventh before Chas McCormick added a sacrifice fly in the eighth.	“He’s using the whole field, he’s turning on the ball,” Baker said of Straw, the No. 8 hitter in the lineup. “We’re just glad he’s doing his thing. We need him, especially at the bottom of the order there.”	Riding their longest streak since a 10-game run in May 2019, the Astros own the best record in the AL (45-28). Houston has won seven straight series after taking the first two of this three-game set.	Baltimore has lost 12 of 13 and owns the AL's worst record (23-50). Right-hander Jorge López (2-9) gave up two runs and five hits over 6 1/3 innings but was outdone by Greinke.	Straw put the Astros up 1-0 with his third home run in 432 career at-bats. The liner to left was initially ruled a double, but the call was overturned after a replay showed the ball clearing the 7-foot wall — and the glove of leaping outfielder Austin Hays — before bouncing back onto the field.	Baltimore used a walk, a single and a fly ball by Cedric Mullins to tie it in the third.	López was lifted in the seventh after McCormick led off with an infield hit. Straw greeted Hunter Harvey with an opposite-field bloop to right that landed in front of a diving Stewart, and by the time the outfielder retrieved the ball and got it to the plate, McCormick had already scored.	REST FOR THE WEARY	Astros SS Carlos Correa was given the day off after going the distance Monday night in a game that lasted 3:40 and featured rain delays totaling 1 hour, 41 minutes. Baker originally planned to sit Correa later this week in Detroit before the Monday marathon “kind of messed up our plans.”	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: RHP Pedro Báez (shoulder) threw around 20 pitches off the mound Tuesday in West Palm Beach, Florida, and hopes to throw on the side again Wednesday. “He said his shoulder is feeling great," Baker said of the former Dodgers reliever, who has yet to play this season. ... OF Kyle Tucker is on the verge of returning after being placed on the injured list on June 15 with an illness. ... RHP Josh James (left hip surgery) is “about ready to go" on a rehab assignment with Class A Fayetteville, according to Baker.	Orioles: LHP Bruce Zimmermann (biceps tendinitis) will be sidelined at least two or three more weeks, manager Brandon Hyde said. The rookie last pitched on June 13. ... OF Anthony Santander missed a second straight start with a tender left ankle. He struck out as a pinch-hitter.	ROSTER MOVE	The Orioles selected the contract of RH knuckleballer Mickey Jannis from Triple-A Norfolk and designated RHP Mac Sceroler for assignment. Jannis has never pitched in the majors.	UP NEXT	Astros RHP José Urquidy (5-3, 3.65 ERA) faces rookie RHP Thomas Eshelman (0-0, 1.93 ERA) in the series finale.	------	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

NEW YORK -- — Gerrit Cole walked off the mound slowly after the first inning, expecting to be stopped by umpires searching for banned sticky substances.	“Certainly I didn't walk past him or be oblivious to the check the first couple times when there was inevitably no check,” he said. “So, yeah, I thought about it a few times.”	Cole's explosive fastball was missing and his spin rate dropped as he pitched for the first time since Major League Baseball’s crackdown on grip enhancers began. He allowed two runs and three hits in seven innings before turning over a lead to the Yankees' bullpen, and Ryan O'Hearn and the Kansas City Royals rallied for four runs in the eighth inning  to beat New York 6-5 Tuesday night.	O'Hearn, a 27-year-old playing his first major league game in three weeks following a stint at Triple-A Omaha, homered off Cole in the fourth and hit an infield single that tied the score 3-all in the eighth.	“I realize that I'm not getting any younger," he said. "I need to contribute. I need to make it happen.”	Luke Voit homered and tripled in his return from the injured list as the Yankees built a 3-2 lead.	Cole, among the most successful pitchers under the highest scrutiny, had his glove and cap searched by umpires after the third and sixth innings and was given an all-clear. A white card, presumably switchable signs, fell out of Cole’s cap when he handed it to umpires for first inspection.	His fastball reached 101 mph and averaged 97.6 mph, slightly above his 97.3 mph season average, and he threw just 46 fastballs along with 35 sliders, 18 curves and nine changeups.	“He's going to navigate this,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. “He’s a great pitcher with with great stuff, great delivery, all kinds of weapons.”	Cole's arsenal has changed this month.	He struck out six after fanning four against Toronto last Wednesday, his first consecutive outings with six or fewer strikeouts since September 2017. Cole had struck out 104 in his first 12 starts this season.	Cole’s fastball revolutions per minute averaged 2,289, down from 2,534 coming in. His curveball dropped to 2,664 from 2,824, his slider to 2,443 from 2,686 and his changeup to 1,644 from 1,812.	“Gosh, if I had a dollar for how many times the Pirates told me to pitch to contact, I mean, I may not have as much money now, but I’d still have quite a bit of money,” Cole said, recalling his first team, long before his record $324 million, nine-year contract with the Yankees. “That's what was hammered into us growing up. And a lot of those fundamentals never left my game."	Kansas City erased an eighth-inning deficit by taking a 6-3 lead against Jonathan Loaisga (7-3). Jarrod Dyson's go-ahead grounder brought Carlos Santana home with a great slide that beat second baseman Tyler Wade's throw, and  Hunter Dozier and Michael A. Taylor singled in runs.	DJ LeMahieu hit a two-run homer in the bottom half against Kyle Zimmer and Aaron Judge doubled off the left-field wall against Scott Barlow, who then retired pinch-hitter Rougned Odor and Giancarlo Stanton.	Greg Holland gave up Gio Urshela’s bloop single starting in the ninth, then got his fifth save  in nine chances. He struck out Gleyber Torres and Clint Frazier, intentionally walked Gary Sánchez and retired Brett Gardner on a popout.	Jake Brentz (2-0) won after allowing New York to take a 3-2 lead on his seventh-inning wild pitch.	ROUTE 66	No. 66 on both teams homered in the same game for the first time in major league history, the Yankees’ Kyle Higashioka in the first inning off Brady Singer and O’Hearn in the fourth.	FAN PRESENCE	Voit hit a deep drive leading off the seventh. Dyson, just inserted into left field, jumped at the wall and as the ball went over his glove, a fan reached in front of the fence and dropped the ball, his hand hitting the back of Dyson’s glove.	Third base umpire Bill Miller signaled safe — meaning the ball was not a home run and was in play — as Voit slid into third. The call was upheld on a video review.	“I thought that was one of the worst placement rulings I’ve ever seen. The ball should be dead when the ball hits a fan’s hands," Royals manager Mike Matheny said.	ON THE FARM	LHP Angel Zerpa made his debut for Double-A Northwest Arkansas, allowing four runs and six hits with nine strikeouts and no walks against Arkansas. He had gone 4-0 with a 2.59 ERA for High-A Quad Cities.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Royals: After missing the first 45 games with a right oblique injury and returning to play 10, SS Adalberto Mondesi went on the 10-day IL on Monday for the third time, now for a strained left oblique. .	Yankees: RHP Darren O’Day (strained right rotator cuff) and LHP Justin Wilson (strained right hamstring) each pitched a scoreless inning as they started injury rehabilitation assignments with Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.	UP NEXT	Royals LHP Danny Duffy (4-3, 1.94) is to make his first start Wednesday since May 12 after recovering from a strained left forearm and will take the mound Wednesday against RHP Michael King (0-3, 4.08). Duffy estimated he will be able to throw up to about 65 pitches.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

PHILADELPHIA -- — A hairy situation clearly miffed Max.	Max Scherzer threw his glove and hat to the grass, then stared down Phillies manager Joe Girardi after getting checked for a third time by umpires for sticky stuff as the Washington Nationals beat Philadelphia 3-2 Tuesday night.	“These are Manfred rules,” Scherzer said, referring to the crackdown by baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred. “Go ask him what he wants to do with this."	Scherzer (6-4) looked sharp in his return to the rotation after missing a start due to a groin injury, striking out eight in five innings. Girardi apparently didn’t like what he saw.	In the fourth, Scherzer whizzed a fastball high and inside to Alec Bohm, sending him sprawling to the ground before striking him out. Prior to the next batter, Girardi asked the umpires to check Scherzer after he noticed the Nationals ace touching his hair.	“It was suspicious for me,” Girardi said.	Major league umpires began a crackdown on Monday by regularly examining pitchers for tacky substances that can give them a better grip on the baseball. Managers also can request a check, although umps can deny it if they believe it’s not in good faith.	The fiery Scherzer already had been checked by second-base umpire Alfonso Marquez after the first and third inning, with the crew chief doing an inspection of the right-hander’s glove, hat and belt.	So when Marquez approached Scherzer for a third time, this time at Girardi’s request, the three-time Cy Young Award winner tossed his glove and hat to the ground, unbuckled his belt and appeared ready to take his pants off in what became a bizarre scene.	“I would have to be an absolute fool to actually use something tonight when everybody’s antenna is so far high they’d look for anything," Scherzer said. “I have absolutely zero on me. I have nothing on me. Check whatever you want. I’ll take off all my clothes if you want to see me.”	Scherzer explained that he was having trouble gripping the baseball and the pitch to Bohm was a byproduct.	“I almost put a 95 mile an hour fastball in his head because the ball slipped out of my hand," he said. “The whole night I was sick of kind of licking my fingers and tasting rosin the whole night.”	Trying to find a way to get a grasp on the baseball, Scherzer reached for his sweaty hair, saying that’s the only place he could find enough moisture without constantly licking his hands after applying rosin -- something he said tasted “gross.”	Girardi said prior to the contest that he would not ask a pitcher to be checked merely for gamesmanship; rather, he would do it only if he legitimately believed there was cause.	“I got nothing,” Scherzer appeared to repeat to the umpires, before glaring at Philadelphia’s dugout, brushing his hair with his hands and yelling, “Just wet!”	“Nothing but sweat,” Marquez said afterward.	Scherzer sent the Phillies down in order in the fifth and stared hard toward Girardi while walking back to the Nationals dugout. Girardi then became unglued, hopping onto the field, motioning with his hands and screaming toward the Nationals dugout.	Plate umpire Tim Timmons intercepted Girardi and ejected him.	“I’m not playing games, I’m trying to win games here,” Girardi said. “I have respect for what Max has done in his career, but I have to do what’s right for our team.”	Scherzer mocked Girardi from Washington’s dugout, holding up his hat and glove as if to ask the Phillies skipper if he wanted to check one more time.	"Hopefully the players across the league understand that what were doing right now, this is not the answer," Scherzer said. “There is a problem with Spider Tack in the game and we've got to get rid of that, but I also think there's a way to handle this in a better way.”	“We’re going to continue to have more events like this happen," Scherzer added. “As pitchers evolve to this, pitchers aren’t going to be too happy doing this because we're tying to play by the rules.”	Yan Gomes had a pair of RBI singles for the Nationals, who have won three straight and eight of nine. Scherzer allowed two hits and one run.	Bryce Harper and Rhys Hoskins hit home runs for Philadelphia, which has lost five of seven.	Washington scored a pair of runs in the first on RBI by Josh Bell and Gomes.	Harper led off the second with a drive to the second deck in right. The Nationals got that run back in the third on Gomes’ second RBI single of the contest.	Hoskins’ one-out homer to left in the eighth off Tanner Rainey brought Philadelphia within a run, but Brad Hand got four outs to record his 16th save.	WHEELS OFF	Phillies starter Zack Wheeler (5-4) lasted just three innings in his worst start of the season. The right-hander allowed three runs on six hits with four strikeouts and a walk.	As with all pitchers under MLB’s new policy, Wheeler was checked for grip enhancers.	“I could really care less,” Wheeler shrugged. “I’m not using anything.”	HAND-Y WORK	Hand had to wriggle out of trouble in the ninth after surrendering a leadoff double to Bohm, hitting Ronald Torreyes and giving up an infield single to pinch-hitter Matt Vierling to load the bases with one out. But the lefty got Odubel Herrera to hit a shallow fly and retired Hoskins on a grounder on a full-count pitch.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Nationals: RHP Kyle Finnegan was placed on the 10-day IL with a left hamstring strain.	Phillies: SS Didi Gregorious, out since May 13 with a right elbow injury, could begin a rehab assignment later this week, general manager Dave Dombrowski said on the club’s pregame radio show.	UP NEXT	Washington RHP Erick Fedde (4-4, 3.33) opposes Phillies RHP Vince Velasquez (2-2, 4.44) in the conclusion of the mini two-game series on Wednesday afternoon.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

NEW YORK -- — Charlie Morton struck out 11 in seven innings of one-hit ball for his 100th major league win, and the Atlanta Braves beat the banged-up New York Mets 3-0 on Tuesday night for their second consecutive shutout against the slumping NL East leaders.	Mets starter Marcus Stroman exited in the second with a sore left hip, the latest blow to a depleted team decimated by pitching injuries lately.	Dansby Swanson hit a three-run homer and Morton (7-3) became the 19th active pitcher to reach 100 wins, hitting the milestone 13 years, 8 days after getting his first one with the Braves. In between stints with Atlanta, the veteran right-hander notched 89 wins for Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Houston and Tampa Bay.	“Took me a really long time,” Morton said with a laugh. “Glad I got there and got there with this group. This is a special night.”	The 37-year-old Morton has 54 wins since the start of the 2017 season, which he ended by getting the final 12 outs of the Houston Astros’ World Series-clinching victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers.	“I've had four surgeries, I've missed a lot of time to injury, I’ve dealt with numerous failures, had so many opportunities that were given to me that probably weren’t given to other guys in my situation,” Morton said. “The long and short of it’s been such an awesome experience, not only the successes but the failures. And to still be here and be on a great team and have a chance to go to the playoffs again — just really fortunate.”	Stroman, who lasted at least six innings in each of his previous eight starts, walked one in a hitless first but left after throwing just three pitches to Austin Riley in the second.	Mets manager Luis Rojas said Stroman was undergoing further testing.	“On one of the pitches, he landed and he felt that he hyperextended it a little bit,” Rojas said. “He wanted to stay but I think it was wise to come out, just be cautious. You can hurt something else just by not being as deliberate with your delivery using your hips. So we’ll reassess how he is (Wednesday).”	The Mets used four relievers one night before right-hander Tylor Megill is expected to make his big league debut. Megill, who is 2-1 with a 3.35 ERA in eight starts between Double-A Binghamton and Triple-A Syracuse, will pitch in place of Joey Lucchesi, who was injured Friday and will undergo season-ending Tommy John surgery Thursday.	Swanson went deep in the third for the Braves, who have won two of three in the four-game series. New York has dropped six of eight overall, totaling only 13 runs and getting shut out four times during that span.	Morton, who carried a no-hitter into the seventh inning of his previous start against St. Louis, held the Mets hitless until pinch-hitting pitcher Jerad Eickhoff reached on an infield single with two outs in the fifth. That was one of just two hits for the punchless Mets — James McCann had a two-out double in the ninth.	“It’s hard to win games in the big leagues,” Braves manager Brian Snitker said. “It hasn’t been easy sledding for Charlie, either. He’s been through adversity and things, different stuff. And to keep going at it like he is right now is just a testament to him and how he takes care of himself."	Morton walked two and plunked a pair of batters.	A.J. Minter tossed a perfect eighth and Will Smith worked the ninth for his 15th save.	Atlanta gave Morton all the support he needed in the third against reliever Yennsy Díaz (0-1). With one out, Ozzie Albies singled and went to second when Abraham Almonte walked. Both runners advanced on Riley’s groundout before Swanson homered to left.	IN A PINCH	With infielder Jonathan Villar (calf) and catcher Tomas Nido (wrist) nursing injuries sustained Monday, the Mets used starting pitchers David Peterson and Eickhoff as pinch-hitters. Peterson struck out in the third.	It was the second time the Mets used two pitchers as pinch-hitters in a game. Jacob deGrom and Steven Matz pinch-hit against San Diego on July 27, 2017.	Eickhoff was New York's starting pitcher in the second game of Monday’s doubleheader. The hit was his first since Aug. 25, 2017.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Braves: LHP Max Fried (blister), who had been scheduled to start Wednesday, was placed on the injured list. Snitker said he hopes Fried will only need the minimum stay. … OF Guillermo Heredia (right wrist inflammation) was scratched a little more than an hour before the first pitch and replaced in the lineup by Ender Inciarte.	Mets: RHP Dellin Betances (right shoulder) had his rehab assignment moved to Triple-A Syracuse.	UP NEXT	Braves: RHP Kyle Wright (0-0, 4.15 ERA) was promoted from Triple-A to take Fried’s spot in the rotation. Wright made his lone big league appearance this year on April 16.	Mets: Megill will become the 12th different starter for New York this season.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- — As advertised, Wander Franco got off to a tremendous start for the Tampa Bay Rays with his production — and prediction.	Franco hit a three-run homer and doubled in his big league debut for the Rays, who lost their seventh straight in falling to the Boston Red Sox 9-5 in 11 innings Tuesday night.	The 20-year-old Franco, considered the best prospect in the minor leagues, connected in the fifth off Eduardo Rodriguez and drew his first curtain call in the majors.	“In that at-bat I actually knew I was going to hit a home run because that was the pitch I was looking for,” Franco said through an interpreter. “I ended up getting the pitch that I was looking for and I was able to help the team out.”	Franco pointed toward his father, who was at the game, while crossing the plate. He got the ball back and plans to display it at his home in the Dominican Republic.	“I felt super good,” Franco said through an interpreter. ”God sent me a surprise with all this."	Praised Rays manager Kevin Cash: “Pretty electric player."	“Win or loss, we're trying to win them all obviously, but it had to be a great day for Wander and his family. A talented player that's going to be fun to watch in the coming months," he said.	Franco doubled in the seventh and finished 2 for 4 with a walk. The switch-hitting infielder came up with one out and a runner on first in the ninth, and grounded out to the mound.	“What a good player he is,” Boston manager Alex Cora said. “The way he controls the at-bat for how young he is. They have a special one.”	Rafael Devers hit a hard grounder that went between first baseman Yandy Díaz’s legs for a two-run double during Boston’s four-run 11th off Pete Fairbanks (1-3).	Darwinzon Hernandez (2-2) went 1 1/3 scoreless innings, retiring Brandon Lowe with two on and two outs in the 10th.	Hunter Renfroe homered for the AL East-leading Red Sox. Rodriguez allowed five runs and seven hits over six innings, and had his winless streak reach eight games.	Renfroe had an RBI single and Kike Hernández hit a sacrifice fly in the 11th.	Called up from Triple-A Durham earlier in the day, Franco received a nice ovation when he went on the field to run pregame. Some fans at Tropicana Field stood when Rays’ lineup was announced over the public-address system and the salute grew to full standing ovation with fans in the left field stands chanting ‘Wander Franco” as he walked to the plate to bat in the first.	Batting second and debuting at third base, Franco alertly began a double play in the eighth. It came after Devers doubled off an overhanging catwalk.	Franco fielded Renfroe's grounder and ran toward Devers, who was called for running out the base line trying to advance. Franco then threw to first to complete the play.	J.D. Martinez drove in two with a double, Devers had a sacrifice fly and Renfroe hit a two-run homer off Ryan Yarbrough as Boston went up 5-2 in the third.	Francisco Mejía drove in a run with an infield single in the first, with Franco scoring the second run on shortstop Xander Bogaerts’ errant throw to second trying to get a forceout.	WEIRD OUTS	Tampa Bay's Kevin Kiermaier was out at second in the ninth after 2B Hernández lost the ball trying to make a tag — the ball went to Bogaerts, who picked it up and stepped on the bag. ... Boston's Bobby Dalbec was thrown at the plate trying to score from third in the 10th after Fairbanks’ pitch got past catcher Mike Zunino. “It was a crazy game," Cora said.	ANOTHER ROOKIE	C Connor Wong was called up from Triple-A Worcester by Boston before the game and made his major league debut as a pinch-runner at second to start the 11th. He scored on Devers’ go-ahead hit.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Red Sox: LHP Chris Sale (Tommy John surgery) will throw to hitters on Saturday. … C Kevin Plawecki, hurt Sunday, went on the 10-day IL with a left hamstring strain. … INF Christian Arroyo (bruised right shin bone) could be available on Wednesday.	UP NEXT	Boston RHP Garrett Richards (4-4) and Rays LHP Rich Hill (5-2) are Wednesday night’s starters.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DETROIT -- — Jonathan Schoop and Jake Rogers each drove in three runs, leading the Detroit Tigers to an 8-2 win over the St. Louis Cardinals on Tuesday night.	Schoop homered and Rogers hit a two-run double in Detroit's six-run fourth inning.	“We had a lot of guys with big at-bats tonight,” said Rogers, who added an RBI triple in the fifth. “I was lucky enough to barrel up a couple of balls and find some green grass.”	Tigers starter Tarik Skubal allowed two runs on four hits and four walks in 4 2/3 innings. Kyle Funkhouser (1-0) was credited with the win after 1 1/3 scoreless innings of relief.	Johan Oviedo (0-3) took the loss, allowing six runs, two earned, on six hits and three walks in 3 2/3 innings. His throwing error played a major role in Detroit's big inning.	With one out and Akil Baddoo on second, Nomar Mazara hit a grounder back to Oviedo. Oviedo threw to third, hoping to get Baddoo, but the throw was several feet behind Nolan Arenado. Baddoo scored easily and Mazara reached third before Lars Nootbaar retrieved the ball from the left-field corner.	“That's a young guy recognizing he had a chance to make a play, which is something you want to see,” Cardinals manager Mike Shildt said. “But it is a tough play, because he's got to hit Nolan on the run, and it got away from him.”	Oviedo walked the next two hitters, loading the bases, and Jake Rogers hit a two-run double to left. Robbie Grossman struck out, and Schoop hit a 2-0 pitch over the Cardinals bullpen for a three-run homer.	“After the bad throw, things got a little fast for me,” Oviedo said. “I got two strikes on Rogers, but I hung a slider, and then I got behind (Schoop) and threw a slider too hard.”	Schoop is hitting .378 with 11 homers and 22 RBI in his last 23 games.	“He's really turned his season around,” Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said. “It is more than the stats show, as well. He's been moving between first and second base, and he's working hard at everything he does on the field.”	Nootbaar's sacrifice fly made it 6-1 in the fifth, and Paul Goldschmidt chased Skubal with a two-out, two-run double.	Harold Castro's squeeze bunt put the Tigers ahead 7-3 in bottom of the fifth, and Rogers followed with an RBI triple.	MOVES	The Cardinals selected Nootbaar from Triple-A Memphis, optioned OF Lane Thomas to Memphis and designated LHP Bernando Flores, Jr. for assignment. Nootbaar was making his major-league debut.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers 1B Miguel Cabrera left the game early with calf stiffness, but Hinch doesn't expect it to be a problem.	Cardinals pitcher Daniel Ponce de Leon left the game with a strained shoulder in the fifth inning. Under baseball's new rules, he was checked for foreign substances before leaving with the Cardinals trainer.	“It feels like the same thing I had in April,” said Ponce de Leon, who missed three weeks with the problem. “This is a really frustrating season, because I've been fighting this all year and can't get rid of it.”	FAN EXCITEMENT	The biggest cheer of the night came for the announcement that the Pistons — who play across the street at Little Caesars Arena — had won the NBA draft lottery.	“As soon as we saw that, we all turned to Matt Manning, because he's our basketball expert,” Hinch said. “If the Pistons need any advice on what to do, Matt's ready to help.”	UP NEXT	The teams finish a two-game series Wednesday afternoon with Manning (0-1, 3.60) making his second career start against John Gant (4-5, 3.50).	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MIAMI -- — The Toronto Blue Jays' bats came alive as soon as they had a chance to face someone other than Sandy Alcantara.	Cavan Biggio and Lourdes Gurriel Jr. doubled on consecutive pitches against reliever Yimi García to break a ninth-inning tie, and Toronto beat the Miami Marlins 2-1 Tuesday night.	The hits came with one out. García (3-6) entered the game after Alcantara stymied the Blue Jays while throwing only 86 pitches in eight innings before departing for a pinch-hitter.	“He was really good,” said Blue Jays coach John Schneider, who ran the team while manager Charlie Montoyo served a one-game suspension. “Seeing what our hitters were saying, we were happy to get him out of there, obviously. He was on tonight. It worked out for us.”	With the score 1-all, Marlins manager Don Mattingly said, the decision to pinch-hit for Alcantara was easy. His replacement, Sandy León, struck out.	“We’ve got to try to score,” Mattingly said. “We’ve got to try to put a run on the board and give him a win that way.”	MLB RBI leader Vladimir Guerrero Jr. singled home the Blue Jays' only run off Alcantara in the sixth.	Toronto’s Ross Stripling allowed one run in six innings. Tim Mayza (2-1) pitched a perfect eighth, and Jordan Romano faced only three batters in the ninth for his fourth save to complete a three-hitter.	Starling Marte led off Miami's ninth with an infield single but was thrown out trying to steal.	“He’s definitely got the green light there," Mattingly said. “The math works, but it didn’t look like he had a great jump.”	Miami rookie Jesús Sánchez hit his second home run in the second inning.	Toronto outfielder George Springer went 0 for 4 in his return to the lineup. He was activated after missing 66 of the first 70 games because of a strained right quadriceps.	“Alcantara pitched his tail off, and our lineup didn’t show off like they usually do,” Stripling said. “But our lineup is special, and now we’re going to throw George Springer in it for the next 90-plus games. It's going to be a lot of fun to see him in there.”	The Blue Jays scratched out a run in the sixth. Bo Bichette was hit by a pitch, stole second, took third on a wild pitch and came home on an opposite-field single by Guerrero.	Toronto improved to 12-2 in interleague games, including 3-0 against Miami. The Marlins fell to 5-13 in one-run games, while Toronto is 6-9.	CRACKDOWN	Both starting pitchers passed inspections by the umpires between innings as part of MLB’s crackdown on sticky substances.	“They kept it lighthearted and quick and easy,” Stripling said. “We started to get a feel for what it looks like. I’ve made adjustments; it’s not a big change. I’m not worried about it moving forward.”	ON BEING REMOVED	Alcantara remained just 4-6 despite an ERA of 2.93. He declined to complain about being lifted after eight innings with the game tied.	"Every five days I try to throw nine innings," the Dominican said in Spanish. “Things happen during the game which might not allow me to, and you have to respect that.”	SITTING OUT	Montoyo's penalty came after MLB concluded Blue Jays rookie Alek Manoah intentionally threw at the Orioles' Maikel Franco last weekend.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Blue Jays: Bichette was hit on the left elbow guard by a 97 mph fastball but stayed in the game. “I think he'll be fine,” Schneider said. “His guard helped him out a little bit.”	Marlins: OF Corey Dickerson (bruised left foot) is expected to be in a boot for three weeks, manager Don Mattingly said. ... 1B-OF Garrett Cooper (lumbar strain) took batting practice and is expected to begin a rehab assignment this week. ... RHP Jorge Guzman (right elbow inflammation) is scheduled to start a game Thursday at extended spring training.	UP NEXT	The Marlins’ Trevor Rogers (7-3, 1.87), who leads all MLB rookies in wins, ERA and strikeouts, is scheduled to start in the series finale Wednesday against Robbie Ray (4-3, 3.50) in a matchup of left-handers.	------	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP--Sports	------	Follow Steven Wine on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Steve--Wine	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

CHICAGO -- — Kyle Hendricks isn't all that interested in labels. The results are what matters to him, and he sure is on quite a roll.	Hendricks dominated over six scoreless innings to win his eighth straight start, Kris Bryant homered and the Chicago Cubs beat the Cleveland Indians 7-1 Tuesday night to avoid a two-game sweep.	Willson Contreras and Patrick Wisdom also went deep, and the Cubs won for only the third time in nine games.	Hendricks (10-4) extended the best streak of his career and the longest by a Cubs pitcher since Jake Arrieta won nine consecutive starts to bridge the 2015 and 2016 seasons.	The right-hander scattered four hits and struck out five without a walk. He also tied Cleveland’s Aaron Civale for the major league lead in wins.	“I feel pretty good, but there's still more left in there,” Hendricks said. “Last start and this start, mentally, is the best I've been all year. But again, it's just putting it all together.”	Hendricks hasn't lost since Pittsburgh beat him on May 9. His ERA has plummeted from 6.23 to 3.84 in that span. And if there were any doubts about whether the Cubs had a true ace after trading Yu Darvish to San Diego in the offseason, Hendricks is doing what he can to erase them — whether he cares about that tag or not.	“We don't really love the labels,” Hendricks said. “I really just want to be that consistent guy every fifth day, every time I take the ball, so my teammates know what they're gonna get.”	OFFENSE DELIVERS	It didn't hurt that that the Cubs perked up at the plate. Held to 14 runs over the previous eight games, they broke out in a big way.	Bryant — who was 7 for 57 over the previous 17 games — made it 1-0 in the fourth when he connected  against rookie Eli Morgan (0-2) for his first home run since June 4 at San Francisco. The drive to about the second row in center field ended a career-worst stretch of 48 at-bats without an extra-base hit.	“I feel like he's in a really comfy place,” Cubs manager David Ross said. “I get to watch these guys so much, you can see when their timing is on and off. It looked like (Monday) he got back to the guy that was taking really good swings and seeing the ball really well.”	The Cubs broke the game open with four in the sixth.	Joc Pederson chased Morgan with a two-run double with none out. Javier Báez — pulled the previous night by Ross because of a baserunning lapse — lined a ground-rule RBI double to left against Nick Sandlin. Contreras then singled in a run to make it 5-0. He and Wisdom added back-to-back solo homers in the eighth.	Cleveland, which had won six of eight, got its run in the top half on a forceout by Amed Rosario after loading the bases with none out.	SOLID START	Morgan gave up four runs and four hits in his third big league start. The 25-year-old right-hander struck out nine and walked none.	“I was cruising through five,” Morgan said. “In the blink of an eye, I'm out of the game with three more runs on the board. That's something I have to continue to get better at, making sure that I have a game plan for each inning, for each batter and finding a way to be my sharpest from pitch 1.”	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: Civale appears headed to the injured list because of soreness in the middle finger on his pitching hand. He is scheduled to be examined by hand specialist Dr. Thomas Graham on Wednesday. “My guess is we will need to make a roster move,” manager Terry Francona said. “Because of tomorrow’s day off, we can let him get looked at first. But I think we’re prepared that he’s going to miss some time.” ... C Roberto Pérez (fractured ring finger) is set to begin a rehab assignment with Triple-A Columbus on Wednesday.	Cubs: Wisdom was examined by the trainer after checking his swing in the second inning, then lined to third.	UP NEXT	Indians: Cleveland opens a four-game series at Minnesota on Thursday, with RHP J.C. Mejia (1-2, 6.11 ERA) pitching for the Indians and RHP José Berríos (7-2, 3.56) going for the Twins.	Cubs: RHP Zach Davies (4-4, 4.66) looks to bounce back as the Cubs open a four-game series against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Thursday. Davies was pounded for eight runs in a loss to Miami last week after delivering back-to-back scoreless outings in winning his previous two starts.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- — Matt Chapman and Ramon Laureano hit two-run home runs in the first two innings and Cole Irvin earned his second straight win as the Oakland A’s capitalized early on Texas’ unorthodox sequence of pitchers, racing to an early nine-run lead on the way to a 13-6 win over the Rangers on Tuesday night.	Laureano, Mark Canha and former Rangers All-Star Elvis Andrus had three hits apiece as the A’s banged out a season-high 15 hits and snapped a three-game losing streak to win for the 10th time in 14 games.	“Nobody panicked (after Monday’s 8-3 loss to Texas),” said Andrus, who went 0 for 4 Monday in his first game against Texas, where he had spent 12 seasons. “We knew we needed to come in hot.”	Irvin (5-7) cruised through four scoreless innings on 40 pitches before allowing four runs on four hits and a hit batter in the fifth.	Taylor Hearn (2-2), making his second start in 38 major league appearances and the first since his MLB debut in April 2019, was chased early. He was charged with four runs in the first inning on two hits and three walks, throwing 34 pitches and recording two outs.	Texas manager Chris Woodward had said he hoped to get about 50 pitches from Hearn before turning to veteran starter Jordan Lyles, who gave up four home runs in 4 1/3 innings in his most recent start last Wednesday at Houston.	“Talking to (Hearn) before the game, I don’t think it was a nervous thing,” Woodward said. “He just didn’t have good command. I mean, he was all over the place.”	Eli White and Joey Gallo homered in the seventh and eighth innings to account for Texas’ other runs.	The Rangers were trying to win consecutive games for the first time since May 21-23, after snapping a six-game losing streak Monday. Texas has 20 of its last 24 games.	Hearn began the game by walking Canha on four pitches, then served up Chapman’s homer to dead center. When Woodward brought in Brett de Geus with two out and the bases loaded in the inning, Andrus hit a two-run single up the middle.	Laureano homered to center in the second off de Geus. Lyles came on to start the third inning, allowed two runs on three hits and then worked five scoreless on two singles. After Lyles departed, Oakland added four runs on five hits in the ninth inning off Demarcus Evans.	The Rangers scored four runs in the fifth on RBI hits by Willie Calhoun, Charlie Culberson, White and Adolis Garcia.	DROPPING THE DRAWERS	When A’s reliever Sergio Romo was checked by the umpires after pitching the seventh inning and allowing White’s homer, Romo flung his belt onto the turf and dropped his trousers.	“He’s a playful guy,” Oakland manager Bob Melvin said. “I don’t think he meant anything by it. … That won’t happen again.”	“He gave up a home run ... I think he just acted on his emotions,” Irvin said.	BEEN THERE	Hearn’s brief outing resembled by his previous start, in his big league debut on April 24, 2019, at Seattle. He recorded one out then, allowing five runs on three hits and four walks on 39 pitches in a 14-2 loss.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- — Anthony DeSclafani and the San Francisco Giants aren't showing any signs of slowing down.	The right-hander allowed three hits over seven sharp innings Tuesday night in a 5-0 victory against the Los Angeles Angels. The surprising NL West leaders have won seven of eight and are a season-high 21 games over .500 with the best record in the majors at 47-26 and a three-game lead over the Dodgers.	“It is definitely fun to be a part of it. I feel like everyone is contributing,” said DeSclafani, who struck out nine in winning his fourth straight start. “No one is trying to get too big. Everyone is staying in their approach and things are taking care of themselves.”	DeSclafani (8-2) did not permit a hit after the second inning and retired 18 of the last 19 batters he faced.	Since giving up 10 earned runs against the Dodgers on May 23, DeSclafani has allowed only six runs (five earned) in his last five starts for a 1.42 ERA while holding opposing hitters to a .171 batting average (19 for 111).	“I feel like he has been the same pitcher all year long. He has been real good with the fastball and excellent with the slider,” Giants manager Gabe Kapler said. “He has been fearless and attacking the strike zone.”	Wilmer Flores provided some of the early offensive support with a home run during a four-run first inning.	Flores, who homered twice in Sunday's win over Philadelphia, extended his hitting streak to 10 games with a two-run shot off Andrew Heaney (4-5) to make it 4-0. Four of Flores' seven home runs have come during his hitting streak.	Mauricio Dubón also went deep and Brandon Crawford had three hits for San Francisco.	The Giants struck early, with all their runs coming in the first two innings. After Buster Posey's grounder scored Mike Yastrzemski, Brandon Belt drove in Darin Ruf with a perfect bunt down the third-base line that stayed fair to make it 2-0.	“That was the most important play all year. It was perfect timing and a creative way over a left-hander to keep them on the ropes,” Kapler said.	Dubón led off the second with a drive that just cleared the wall in right-center for his fifth homer of the season.	Heaney went six innings and allowed five runs on 10 hits while tying a season high in strikeouts with 10.	Los Angeles' best chance to get to DeSclafani came in the second inning when Max Stassi led off with a single and advanced to third on José Iglesias' double. But Luis Rengifo and David Fletcher were retired on fly balls to the outfield not deep enough to advance the runners, and Justin Upton struck out to end the inning.	“If you don’t get to him early, he is going to settle in. We had opportunities early and nothing happened. If we did it would have been a different game,” Angels manager Joe Maddon said.	UPTON EXITS	Upton left the game due to lower back tightness after striking out in the second inning. Maddon said the team should know more before Wednesday's game.	If Upton is unable to play, that could mean Shohei Ohtani might not hit, as he is scheduled to take the mound. Ohtani has hit in seven of his 10 pitching starts this season, but Maddon might not want to do that if he has a short bench.	If Ohtani is in the lineup, it would mark the first time in a major league game that the NL team uses a designated hitter and the AL team does not, since the interleague game is being played in an AL park.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Giants: RHP Logan Webb (right shoulder strain) threw a bullpen Monday. Kapler said it went well but did not indicate when the next one is scheduled. ... INF Tommy La Stella (left hamstring strain) went 0 for 3 for Triple-A Sacramento in the first game of his rehab assignment. La Stella is on the 60-day injured list and isn't eligible to come off until July 4.	Angels: LHP José Quintana pitched a scoreless seventh inning in his first game since being activated Monday. The left-hander went on the IL due to left shoulder inflammation, but lost his spot in the rotation due to a 1/3 record and the continued improvement shown by Patrick Sandoval with wins in his last two outings.	UP NEXT	San Francisco RHP Kevin Gausman opposes Ohtani in what might be the day's best pitching matchup. Gausman (8-1) is second in the majors with a 1.51 ERA and tied for fourth in wins. Ohtani (3-1, 2.70 ERA) has 50 strikeouts in his last seven starts.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PHOENIX -- — Burly slugger Daniel Vogelbach hobbled home on one leg when Arizona's defense fell asleep, and the Diamondbacks dropped back into a rut Tuesday night with a 5-0 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers.	A day after ending a 17-game losing streak, the Diamondbacks were behind from the start. Kolten Wong led off with a home run and that was plenty for Freddy Peralta and the Brewers' bullpen in a combined two-hitter.	After the game, Brewers manager Craig Counsell said Vogelbach suffered a significant hamstring strain and will go on the injured list.	Arizona lost outfielder Ketel Marte, who is hitting .366. He slowed down on his way to second on a ground-rule double in the first inning and exited with tightness in his left hamstring.	Vogelbach, however, took a far more unusual path to score in the sixth.	He was on second with two outs and the Brewers ahead 1-0 when Omar Narvaez singled to center field against reliever Stefan Crichton.	The hit normally would've scored Vogelbach without a play. But he pulled up lame just after rounding third base and even veered away from the plate.	Arizona infielders Josh Rojas and Nick Ahmed, however, never saw Vogelbach in distress. Instead, they tossed the ball to each other after getting the relay despite the waving and hollering from Crichton, catcher Daulton Varsho and teammates.	Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo was among those trying to get their attention. He watched the play unfold right in front of him from the third-base dugout. A middle infielder in his playing career, he understood the situation.	“We saw him pull up, right in front of us. A number of us were trying to let them know," Lovullo said.	“They have middle-infielder responsibilities, keeping their heads on a swivel. Watching them play, having played, sometimes you take for granted that the run's going to score. It was just one of those plays. I feel like we’re good enough to execute it."	It might not have mattered in the end because the Diamondbacks only managed two hits — and Peralta had their number again. He gave up just one hit to Arizona in 7 1/3 innings in Milwaukee on June 4.	“It’s the second time he’s done that to us,” Lovullo said. “Fastball command, backdoor breaking balls, a combination of a lot of things he had working today."	Arizona is normally an outstanding defensive team — Ahmed has been a Gold Glove winner. But the defense has been just one of many elements that has failed the Diamondbacks during a historic plunge that has seen them lose 41 of their last 47 games.	“We’ve played satisfactory defense at times. There was an error (on Rojas) that allowed Vogelbach to get on first base. We've got to tighten that up,” Lovullo said.	Peralta (7-2) gave up just one hit — Marte's double — and struck out 10 in six innings. Arizona's only other hit came on Pavin Smith's infield roller in the ninth.	Christian Yelich homered into the pool in right-center field off Riley Smith in the eighth for the Brewers’ final run.	Zac Gallen (1-3), in his second start since missing six weeks with a sprained right elbow, gave up three runs in five innings.	The Diamondbacks fell to 2-18 in June and haven’t won back-to-back games since May 10-11 against Miami.	REASON TO CHEER	During a sixth-inning Milwaukee mound visit, the Chase Field crowd erupted in cheers. A block away, the Phoenix Suns beat the Los Angeles Clippers 104-103 at the buzzer to take a 2-0 series lead in the Western Conference finals.	ABOUT YOUR GLOVE	Peralta was asked to change his glove before taking the mound in the bottom of the first. But it had nothing to do with umpires checking it for substances; rather, they objected to the light color of the mitt.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Diamondbacks: 3B Eduardo Escobar pinch-hit for Gallen in the fifth inning and struck out. Escobar missed Monday’s game with a quad strain. ... RHP Tyler Clippard, sidelined all season with a sprained right shoulder, threw a bullpen before the game.	Brewers: LHP Brett Anderson was placed on the 10-day injured list, one day after hurting his right knee trying to beat a throw to first. Counsell said Anderson will be evaluated when the team returns to Milwaukee on Thursday.	ROSTER MOVES	Brewers: To replace Anderson, RHPs Miguel Sanchez and Ryan Weber were called up from Nashville. Milwaukee sent LHP Hoby Milner back to the Triple-A team.	OF Tyrone Taylor returned from the injured list and OF Derek Fisher was designated for assignment. Taylor appeared as a pinch-hitter in the seventh and struck out. Sanchez, making his major league debut, pitched a scoreless eighth inning and received hugs and high-fives from his teammates.	The promotion of Sanchez and Weber brought the Brewers’ roster total this season to 50. Only Seattle (51 entering Tuesday) has had more players this season, which still hasn’t reached the halfway point.	“It’s been a challenge, especially with some of the guys from different organizations to try to figure out roles for them to succeed,” Counsell said.	UP NEXT	The series concludes Wednesday afternoon in Phoenix with Brewers RHP Brandon Woodruff (5-3, 1.94 ERA) opposing Diamondbacks lefty Caleb Smith (2-2, 3.21). The Diamondbacks are trying to win their first series since beating Colorado from April 29 to May 2.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN DIEGO -- — With the sellout crowd of 42,667 on its feet in the ninth inning, right fielder Wil Myers chased down Justin Turner's slicing liner to end the San Diego Padres' 3-2 win against the rival Los Angeles Dodgers.	Star shortstop Fernando Tatis Jr. shot both arms into the air in celebration as the fans roared. Third baseman Manny Machado, who saved the game in the eighth with some clutch defensive plays, raised his right arm.	It's a whole different vibe at Petco Park now that it's been opened to 100% capacity.	Jake Cronenworth and rookie Kim Ha-seong homered off Clayton Kershaw, Blake Snell pitched five scoreless innings and the Padres got their third straight victory against the Dodgers and sixth in a row overall following a 4-13 skid.	Manager Jayce Tingler said the Padres have been feeding off the crowds.	“It’s absolutely electric. We come out of the tunnel and you get to the dugout and you can just feel the energy," Tingler said. “You can hear it as you walk down the tunnel. The anthem goes on and you eyeball the stadium and it’s packed.	“Then it comes game time and the place is just electric," he added. “It fills us full of energy, it fills us full of juice. It’s our responsibility to play good, winning baseball and it’s nice being able to feed off that electricity in the stadium, that’s for sure.”	The Padres improved to 6-3 this season against the Dodgers and will go for a three-game sweep Wednesday night.	The Padres won a wild-card series against the St. Louis Cardinals at empty Petco Park following the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, and then were swept in the NL Division Series by the eventual World Series champion Dodgers.	Snell (3-3) got his first victory in four career starts against the Dodgers, including three this year. He didn't factor into the decision in either outing earlier this season.	Snell was pulled from Game 6 of the World Series by Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash with the Rays leading the Dodgers 1-0 in the sixth inning. The Dodgers won the game and the Series. Snell was traded to the Padres on Dec. 29.	The left-hander, who won the 2018 AL Cy Young Award, held the Dodgers to four hits while striking out five and walking three.	“The atmosphere is great," Snell said. “I love the energy, I love the rivalry, I love everything about it, especially pitching at home against them. There's a lot of meaning into those starts."	The Dodgers had runners at the corners with two outs in the first before Snell struck out Will Smith. They loaded the bases with two outs in the fourth before Snell got Steven Souza Jr. to hit into a force play.	Mark Melancon pitched the ninth for his 22nd save. Before he could take the mound, though, he was checked by two umpires for sticky substances. He allowed Austin Barnes' pinch-hit homer with one out.	Kershaw (8-7), a three-time NL Cy Young Award winner who doubled up in 2014 by also winning the MVP award, allowed three runs and four hits, struck out seven and walked two in six innings.	He allowed Cronenworth's two-run homer to right with one out in the first, his 10th. Tommy Pham was aboard on a leadoff walk. Cronenworth also hit a two-run homer in Monday night's 6-2 win.	Kim didn't start after injuring his right index finger Monday night but was OK enough to drive a curveball from Kershaw into the left-field seats while pinch-hitting for Snell with one out in the fifth. It was his fifth.	The Dodgers got a run in the eighth when Smith grounded into a double play with the bases loaded. Padres third baseman Machado tagged Turner and then threw to second for a force. Rookie Mason Thompson came on to make his big league debut. He walked Max Muncy before getting AJ Pollock to ground to Machado for a force.	SWEATY SNELL	Snell was checked twice for sticky substances, as was Kershaw. “They’re not going to find sticky stuff on me," Snell said. “They’re just going to find sweat. If they want to touch that, they’re more than welcome to.”	THE GARV	Steve Garvey, who starred with the Dodgers for 14 seasons before signing as a free agent with the Padres before the 1983 season, watched from a seat right behind home plate. He helped lead the Dodgers to the 1981 World Series title. In 1984, he hit what is still considered the biggest home run in Padres history, a walk-off shot in Game 4 of the NLCS against the Chicago Cubs at Jack Murphy Stadium. The Padres won the next day to reach their first World Series.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: Activated Muncy from the 10-day injured list. He missed eight games with a strained right oblique. OF Zach Reks was sent back to Triple-A a day after making his big league debut.	Padres: Kim didn't start a day after injuring the index finger on his throwing hand while fielding a grounder by Smith. Tingler said there was still a bit of swelling in the finger and Kim went through a pregame workout. X-rays taken Monday night were negative.	UP NEXT	RHP Trevor Bauer (7-5, 2.45 ERA) of the Dodgers and RHP Joe Musgrove (4-6, 2.28) of the Padres meet in another marquee matchup in the series finale Wednesday night. Bauer won the 2020 NL Cy Young Award with Cincinnati and Musgrove threw the first no-hitter in the history of his hometown Padres on April 9 at Texas.	------	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

SEATTLE -- — Shed Long Jr. followed up his grand statement from last weekend with another game-winning swing for the Seattle Mariners.	It's been a special couple of days for Long in his attempt to overcome injuries and rediscover the potential he showed a couple of years ago.	“I’m trying to come in and be the best version of me that I can be every day no matter what. Not just the 2019 version,” Long said. “I’m trying to be the best version of me. I want to be better than the 2019 version.”	Long hit his second straight decisive homer Tuesday night against Colorado. This time it was a solo shot with one out in the eighth inning that lifted Seattle over the Rockies 2-1 for the Mariners' fifth straight victory.	Two days after Long hit a game-ending grand slam in the 10th inning to complete a four-game sweep of the Tampa Bay Rays, the left-handed hitter came through again with another late long ball for the Mariners.	Long drove a 1-1 pitch from Tyler Kinley (1-2) to straightaway center field. It was the second straight appearance in which Kinley gave up homer, after he blew a save opportunity last Saturday against Milwaukee.	“It’s hard to hit a ball out to dead center here and know it’s gone the minute you hit it,” Seattle manager Scott Servais said. “He certainly got all of that one.”	Paul Sewald (4-2) worked the eighth inning for Seattle to get the win, and Kendall Graveman pitched the ninth for his sixth save and first since May 16.	The Mariners have won eight of nine.	Seattle starter Chris Flexen was on the cusp of another dominant performance before C.J. Cron’s homer with two outs in the seventh inning pulled the Rockies even at 1.	Cron caught up to a 95 mph fastball and drove it to right-center field for his 10th homer of the season.	The home run snapped Flexen’s streak of scoreless innings at 15. But other than the brief troubles in the seventh, Flexen was outstanding. He struck out six and didn’t allow a hit until Brendan Rodgers’ single in the fifth. Flexen has allowed three earned runs or less in four of his past five starts.	“I think each outing I’ve continued to grow, to trust myself, trust my plan,” Flexen said.	Colorado starter Kyle Freeland recovered from three rough starts to post his best outing of the season. Freeland had allowed 18 earned runs in his past three outings, including nine home runs, but managed to stymie the Mariners.	Freeland scattered five hits and struck out seven. The only run allowed came on J.P. Crawford’s infield hit with the bases loaded and two outs in the fifth. But the Mariners missed out on their chance at a big inning on Dylan Moore’s baserunning mistake that became the third out.	“It was nice to have that feeling back of commanding the baseball, knowing I’m on top of it, staying through it, putting it in the spots I want it to be,” Freeland said. “It was very encouraging to see that and feel that and get back to the way I like to pitch.”	HIT STREAK	Colorado's Raimel Tapia singled in the sixth inning to extend his hitting streak to 18 games, the longest active streak in the majors. It's the longest by a Rockies player since Carlos Gonzalez's 19-game streak in 2016.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Rockies: RHP Jon Gray may return to the rotation this weekend against Milwaukee, manager Bud Black said. Gray made a rehab start for Triple-A Albuquerque on Sunday and threw on the side before Tuesday’s game. Gray went on the injured list this month with a flexor strain. ... INF/OF Chris Owings was reinstated from the 60-day injured list shortly before the start of the game. Owings had been out since early April following thumb surgery. The Rockies designated RHP Joe Harvey for assignment.	Mariners: 1B Evan White was transferred to the 60-day injured list after having a setback in his recovery from a hip flexor injury while on a rehab assignment at Triple-A Tacoma. Servais said White had left Seattle to seek a second opinion on the injury. White has been out since May 14. Seattle claimed INF/OF Jake Hager off waivers from Milwaukee to take White’s spot on the 40-man roster. Hager will report to Tacoma. Seattle also recalled INF Donovan Walton from Tacoma, and RHP Yohan Ramirez was optioned.	UP NEXT	Rockies: RHP German Márquez (5-6, 4.26) makes his 16th start. He threw six shutout innings in his last start against Milwaukee but had to be removed early because of cramps. He’s 1-1 with a 2.08 ERA in two career starts vs. Seattle.	Mariners: LHP Justus Sheffield (5-6, 5.65) makes his 13th start of the season. Sheffield allowed a season-high seven runs over five innings in his last start against Minnesota.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

PITTSBURGH -- — Yasmani Grandal hit a two-run double and the Chicago White Sox stopped a five-game losing streak, beating the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-3 Wednesday.	Leury García added a home run as the AL Central leaders ended their longest skid of the season.	Chicago starter Dylan Cease (6-3) bounced back from a rough outing to work 5 2/3 innings, allowing one earned run while striking out seven.	“I did an Ozzie Smith somersault when we got that last out,” manager Tony La Russa joked. “You take it too serious, because this what you do for a living, but you know, it’s been kind of miserable. Five straight days, so we’d have taken a win anytime in there to ease the misery. … If you had to pick one of the five to win, you’d pick this one.”	Cease was tagged for seven runs in 3 1/3 innings in his previous start at Houston. That game was the first of Chicago’s slump, and Cease was happy to be one to help end it on Wednesday.	“Anytime you can help the team get a win, it’s why I’m here,” he said. “It’s not just all me, though. Between our defense and our offense, I’m just happy to be able to do my part.”	Liam Hendricks pitched a perfect ninth for his 19th save of the season.	Grandal’s tiebreaking hit came with two outs in the fifth inning and finished Pirates starter Chase De Jong (0-2).	García led off the second with his first home run of the season, a first-pitch drive to right center.	Pittsburgh scored twice in the second after Cease made two errors in attempting to field a bunt by De Jong with Michael Perez on first base. Cease first dropped the ball and then threw it away, giving the Pirates runners at second and third.	“We’ve all seen that inning get away because the pitcher just loses concentration and doesn’t realize he’s been good,” La Russa said. “Just get the next hitter out and go from there. That’s a really good example of his growth and his potential.”	Chicago outfielder Luis González got his first big league hit with a second-inning double and scored on Tim Anderson’s double.	González made his first start as the White Sox navigate the absence of outfielder Adam Engel, who was placed on the injured list on Tuesday.	Adam Frazier had an RBI grounder and Ke’Bryan Hayes singled home a run that made it 2-all.	Frazier doubled and scored on a single by Hayes in the seventh.	Hayes, who had gone 2 for 13 over the first four games of the Pittsburgh homestand, finished 2 for 4 with a walk and two RBI.	“We talk about slow heartbeats with a bunch of guys. This guy definitely has one,” Pittsburgh manager Derek Shelton said. “He stays under control, doesn’t let it affect him on the other side of the ball. Obviously there’s going to be some highs and lows, but no thought that he’s not going to grind through it.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Pirates: LHP Sam Howard has been diagnosed with right knee tendinitis, but is not expected to miss significant time. … RHP Luis Oviedo (left quad strain) is expected to throw a simulated game in St. Louis.	UP NEXT	White Sox LHP Carlos Rodon (6-20, 1.83 ERA) is scheduled to start a three-game series with the Mariners in Chicago on Friday. Rodon has allowed just one run in each of his three starts in June and has a 1.42 ERA this month.	Pirates RHP Chad Kuhl (1-4, 5.66) will start a seven-game road swing in St. Louis on Thursday. The Pirates are 0-5 against the Cardinals this season and have lost 10 straight against St. Louis overall.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

PHILADELPHIA -- — A slugfest came down to a 34-year-old pitcher trying to shut down the middle of the order for his first career save.	No problem for Paolo Espino.	Starlin Castro hit a go-ahead, two-run single off closer Hector Neris in the ninth inning, Espino got the final three outs and the Washington Nationals rallied three times to beat the Philadelphia Phillies 13-12 Wednesday.	It was the first game in major league history that featured a grand slam and three-run homer for each team.	“Boom,” Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. “There’s no way to sum it up.”	Josh Bell answered Andrew McCutchen’s slam with one of his own as the Nationals overcame deficits of 5-0, 9-5 and 12-11.	Kyle Schwarber hit Washington’s three-run homer and Travis Jankowski had one for Philadelphia. Bryce Harper also connected for the Phillies.	Both clubs let their bats do the talking after Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo called Phillies manager Joe Girardi a “con artist” for asking umpires to check Max Scherzer for illegal substances during Tuesday night’s game.	Phillies President Dave Dombrowski defended his manager, saying Rizzo’s comment was “totally improper.”	Girardi's biggest issue this time was trying to find a pitcher to hold any lead.	Meanwhile, Martinez had already used seven pitchers by the time he handed it over to Espino for his 30th career appearance. The Panama native retired Rhys Hoskins and Harper on two pitches. After J.T. Realmuto reached on an error, Brad Miller lined out.	“Espino is pretty much our secret weapon,” Martinez said. “He's the one guy I know will go out there and pump strikes.”	Espino has 21 strikeouts and only three walks in 28 2/3 innings.	“I've been blessed my entire career with good command,” Espino said. “I throw strikes, attack hitters. That’s what I try to do.”	After Ronald Torreyes gave the Phillies a 12-11 lead in the bottom of the eighth with an RBI single, Neris allowed consecutive singles to Bell and Josh Harrison to start the ninth and Alex Avila's sacrifice moved the runners.	Castro then lined a single to center to put Washington ahead to stay as Neris (1-4) blew his fifth save in 15 tries.	“I was ready for the fastball and I hit it the other way,” Castro said.	Tanner Rainey (1-2) got the last two outs in the eighth.	The Phillies jumped on Nationals starter Erick Fedde, who had thrown 21 consecutive scoreless innings before Jankowski crushed his first homer since Sept. 26, 2018, in the second.	But Philadelphia’s Vince Velasquez, who retired the first 10 batters before Trea Turner lined a double with one out in the fourth, couldn’t get past the fifth.	The Nationals scored five off Velasquez and Archie Bradley in the fifth and six more off Sam Coonrod and David Hale in the sixth..	Schwarber, who struck out his first two at-bats, smashed an 0-1 pitch off Bradley the opposite way for his 19th homer and 10th in 12 games.	Coonrod walked the bases loaded and struck out two batters before giving way to Hale. Trea Turner hit a two-run single to cut it to 9-7. After Juan Soto walked to load the bases again, Bell blasted one the opposite way to left-center for an 11-9 lead.	“We had leads and we gave them away by issuing so many bases on balls and you can’t do that,” Girardi said. “We have to be better.”	WEAR IT	Jankowski was 3 for 4 with a walk, falling a triple short of the cycle. The long-haired lefty circled the bases in the second and put on the Phillies straw hat worn in the dugout by players who hit homers.	NOBODY ON	All 10 of Harper’s homers have been solo shots, tying the team record for most home runs with nobody on base to start the season. Fred Luderus previously did it in 1914. Felipe Alou’s 17 solo homers to start the season in 1966 is a major league record.	STARTING TIME	Nationals: Fedde gave up five runs and six hits in four innings.	Phillies: Velasquez yielded four runs and three hits in 4 1/3 innings.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Phillies: McCutchen wasn’t in the starting lineup because of knee soreness but entered as a pinch-hitter in the fifth.	UP NEXT	Nationals: RHP Joe Ross (3-7, 4.54 ERA) starts the opener of a four-game series at Miami on Thursday night.	Phillies: After a day off, RHP Aaron Nola (5-4, 4.22) pitches the opener of a doubleheader at the New York Mets on Friday. LHP Matt Moore (0-1, 7.36) is expected to start the second game.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DETROIT -- — The Detroit Tigers are on a relative roll, winning three straight games for the second time in a 10-day stretch.	Jonathan Schoop has had a lot to do with it.	Schoop hit a solo homer and a two-run double to help the Tigers  beat the skidding St. Louis Cardinals  6-2 Wednesday.	Schoop has hit 10 home runs this month, including one in an 8-2 win over the Cardinals on Tuesday night.	“It’s something special because the hard work is paying off," Schoop said. “I just have to keep it up. There were some good stretches (previously), but this is one of the best."	While the Tigers are playing well despite being 10 games under .500, St. Louis is going in the opposite direction.	The Cardinals have lost five of six. Since leading the NL Central nearly a month ago, they have lost 16 of 22 games in large part because starting pitchers and hitters are struggling.	“It’s not a good recipe for shaking hands consistently," manager Mike Shildt said. “We have to find a solution to both, or at least one."	Matt Manning (1-1) allowed two runs on five hits and two walks over 5 2/3 innings. It was his second career start and first at Comerica Park, where his parents were among the fans in the stands that gave him a standing ovation.	“I took him out kind of early, wanting him to experience some success," manager A.J. Hinch said.	Gregory Soto, Jose Cisnero and Michael Fulmer combined to pitch 3 1/3 innings of scoreless relief.	John Gant (3-4) lasted just three-plus innings. He gave up three runs on two hits and four walks after entering the game leading the majors with 48 walks.	“I just have to throw more strikes, attack the zone a little better and pitch a little deeper into games," he said. “I didn’t give the team a great chance to win with my outing."	Gant's outing ended when Daz Cameron hit a tiebreaking, solo home run in the fourth inning.	Ryan Helsley followed and Schoop hit his 15th homer off the reliever in the fifth to put the Tigers ahead 4-2. They added extra runs to provide a cushion that didn't prove to be necessary.	The offensively challenged Cardinals scored a run in the second on Nolan Arenado's solo homer and went ahead 2-0 in the third on Tommy Edman's single.	Schoop tied it with a double in the bottom of the third.	“His presence in our lineup is just different," Hinch said. “We know he’s capable of doing anything. All of us want Jonathan up to bat as much as possible."	HE SAID IT	Hinch, a former major league catcher, acknowledged even he gets mesmerized by Cardinals superstar Yadier Molina	“I get caught watching him behind the plate," Hinch said. “He’s the marquee guy in the league. He’s a future Hall of Famer.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Cardinals: RHP Daniel Ponce de Leon was placed on the 10-day injured list with a shoulder injury Wednesday, a day after leaving a game in the fifth inning with a shoulder injury. RHP Seth Elledge came up from Triple-A Memphis to take Ponce de Leon’s roster spot.	Ponce de Leon missed three weeks earlier this year with a shoulder ailment.	“It's not in the exact same spot as last time, but it’s just fatigue," Shildt said.	RHP Kodi Whitley (back spasms) has been throwing and is getting closer to a rehab assignment	Tigers: Miguel Cabrera was not in the lineup after leaving the game the previous night with calf stiffness, but he was available to pinch-hit. ... OF Robbie Grossman was given the day off with a non-COVID virus.	UP NEXT	The Tigers continue a homestand on Thursday night with a four-game series against Houston. St. Louis opens a seven-game homestand Thursday night against Pittsburgh.	“We have a lot of guys who know how to win, but we’re just not winning right now," Shildt said.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PHOENIX -- — Brandon Woodruff was pleased with the seven dominant innings he threw on Wednesday afternoon, though he didn't really have that much to say about them.	Instead, like most pitchers, especially ones coming into the game with a .042 batting average, he wanted to talk about his hit.	Woodruff continued his terrific season on the mound and added an RBI single at the plate to lead the Milwaukee Brewers to a 3-2 win over the skidding Arizona Diamondbacks.	“I'm glad you brought that up,” Woodruff said, grinning when asked about his second hit of the season. “Ended up being the difference in the game so I’ll take it I guess.”	The hard-throwing Woodruff (6-3) gave up just three hits and one run. He walked two, struck out nine and also had a single in the fifth inning that scored Jace Peterson to give the Brewers a 1-0 lead. Milwaukee would never trail.	Woodruff has been a fairly good hitter throughout his career, coming into the season with a .253 batting average in 63 at-bats. But he's struggled at the plate this year and was just 1 for 24 before Wednesday's hit.	Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said Woodruff takes his hitting seriously and on the days he's not pitching can often be found in the dugout with a bat in his hands.	“That was a big run,” Counsell said.	While Woodruff's hitting has been a struggle this year, pitching hasn't been a problem. He's been one of the best in the big leagues this season, giving up just 51 hits in 95 innings. His ERA improved to 1.89. The 28-year-old overpowered many of the D-backs batters with fastballs and hard sinkers that were consistently around 95 to 98 mph.	“When he starts mixing, it makes it tough," D-backs first baseman Christian Walker said. “He threw the ball well. We knew what we were up against. It was hard to get a rally going.”	Josh Hader worked a scoreless ninth for his 19th save.	Milwaukee pushed into sole possession of first place in the NL Central with a 42-33 record, one-half game in front of the Chicago Cubs.	The Diamondbacks have dropped 19 of their last 20 games and 42 of their past 48. Their record fell to 21-55 and they’re on pace to lose more than 115 times this season.	Left-hander Caleb Smith (2-3) took the loss despite a good outing, giving up just one run over six innings. He gave up four hits, walked four and struck out six. He's been one of the team's better pitchers since re-joining the rotation, giving up eight runs over 26 1/3 innings over five starts.	“To hold a team to one run, you’re expecting to win a baseball game,” Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said. “He just had someone on the other side matching his zeroes.”	Walker and Eduardo Escobar both hit solo homers for the D-backs. Escobar's was his 16th of the season and the first of his career as a pinch-hitter. It was a no-doubter into the right-center seats and cut Milwaukee's lead to 3-2 in the eighth.	HIURA RETURNS	Keston Hiura was called up from Triple-A Nashville to replace Daniel Vogelbach, who went on the 10-day injured list with a strained hamstring suffered on Tuesday.	Hiura was in the Brewers' lineup on Wednesday, batting sixth and playing first base. He was hitless in three plate appearances and drew a walk.	The 24-year-old Hiura had a terrific rookie season in 2019 when he hit .303 with 19 homers. But he regressed in 2020 and has been even worse in 2021, batting .130 with one homer. He's been excellent during his stint in Triple-A this season, batting .405 with five homers in 72 at-bats.	MAKING MOVES	The Diamondbacks called up OF Nick Heath from Triple-A Reno. RHP Stefan Crichton was designated for assignment. Crichton has an 0-4 record this season with a 6.04 ERA in 29 appearances.	UP NEXT	The Brewers get a break on Thursday before starting a homestand against Colorado on Friday. The Brewers will send RHP Corbin Burnes (3-4, 2.62 ERA) to the mound.	The Diamondbacks also are off Thursday before traveling to San Diego for a three-game series starting Friday. Arizona will be trying to snap a 23-game road losing streak, which is the longest in modern-day MLB history. The Diamondbacks will send RHP Corbin Martin (0-2, 8.62 ERA) to the mound. San Diego will counter with RHP Chris Paddack (4-5, 4.10).	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- — By the time the San Francisco Giants got back to the clubhouse from a 13-inning marathon against the Los Angeles Angels, they were looking at starting pitcher Kevin Gausman a bit funny.	“Did you pitch in this game?" manager Gabe Kapler jokingly asked him.	Gausman did pitch against Shohei Ohtani, and they were both really good. But long after that compelling mound showdown, the Giants finally got the breaks they needed to break through in this nearly five-hour endurance contest against the Los Angeles Angels.	Ohtani struck out nine over six innings of one-run ball, but the major league-leading Giants rallied for seven runs in the 13th and a 9-3 victory over Los Angeles on Wednesday, sweeping the two-game interleague series.	The ramshackle ending included 10 combined runs in the final two innings, premature celebratory fireworks at Angel Stadium and a left fielder playing catcher while a pitcher played left field for the Halos.	None of it reflected the high-level starting performances: Gausman yielded four hits with nine strikeouts over seven strong innings, trading zeros with Ohtani and lasting an inning longer. Both starters gave up runs only on a pair of solo homers in the fifth.	“Obviously a pitchers’ duel for the majority of the game, and our bullpen really pitched well down the stretch,” Gausman said. “I got done everything I needed to get done (for arm recovery) long ago. I was definitely sitting around watching the guys. I was getting ready to go back in the dugout, but then the guys put it away.”	Ohtani threw a season-high 105 pitches, his most since undergoing Tommy John surgery in 2018. Mike Yastrzemski’s homer in the fifth accounted for San Francisco’s only run off Ohtani, who issued just one walk and induced 21 swings and misses — the second-most in his major league career, according to Statcast.	“It was really hot out there, but I managed to fight through it and got my six innings in,” Ohtani said through his translator. “At the beginning of the game, my body felt heavy. It was hard to move around. That’s probably why the (velocity) wasn’t there. As the game went on, I felt better and better, and I think the (velocity) went up.”	Ohtani began the day tied for the major league lead in homers but went 0 for 3 with two strikeouts against Gausman.	“Obviously he’s a great pitcher, and his splitter was moving in a way I haven’t really seen recently,” Ohtani said. “He got the best of us.”	Steven Duggar had an RBI double in the 12th and a two-run single in the 13th for the Giants, who finally blew it open while the Angels had outfielder Taylor Ward playing catcher and right-hander Griffin Canning playing left field as the fallout from an untimely injury to Kurt Suzuki.	Mike Tauchman struck out five times before hitting a three-run homer to cap the 13th-inning rally by the Giants, who have won eight of nine.	“It was just one of those games, man,” Angels manager Joe Maddon said. “You could win it so many ways, and you don’t, and that’s what’s frustrating.”	Alex Claudio (1-2) walked three straight in the 13th for the Angels, who lost their third straight.	Dominic Leone (1-0) won despite yielding the tying run in the 12th.	TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING	The 13-inning game matched the longest in the majors since the institution of the runner-on-second-base rule to open extra innings last season. The Giants hadn’t scored seven runs in an extra inning since May 30, 1940, when they put up eight in the 12th against the Dodgers.	SO CLOSE	The Angels thought they won in the 12th: Shortly after Juan Lagares tied it with an RBI single, he was called safe at the plate when he ran home on Luis Rengifo’s grounder.	But the umpires reversed their call on video review shortly after the Big A set off its celebratory fireworks, ruling Buster Posey barely applied the tag in time.	“I didn't think there was anything conclusive to overturn it,” Maddon said. "That simple. I thought it would stand, because that's why the call on the field is so important. I don't know exactly who, or why they chose to do that. I'm certain if I started complaining a bit, it's not really going to matter. It's just part of this system that needs to be improved upon.”	POSITION SHUFFLE	Maddon let Ohtani hit even though Justin Upton was sidelined by a back injury. That left Los Angeles with two reserve position players: utilityman Phil Gosselin and catcher Max Stassi, who both pinch-hit before the 12th.	When Suzuki was injured by a foul ball, the Angels turned to Ward, who performed well at the position he played early in his baseball career. No balls went to Canning in left.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Giants: Brandon Belt left with a right knee injury in the eighth after he attempted to score the tiebreaking run from third. He'll be evaluated in San Francisco, Kapler said. ... INF Wilmer Flores was out of the starting lineup after leaving Tuesday's game early with hamstring tightness.	Angels: Upton's lower back tightness isn't thought to be serious, Maddon said. ... Maddon had no details on Suzuki's injury.	UP NEXT	Giants: Johnny Cueto (5-3, 4.05 ERA) is the likely starter against Oakland on Friday when the Bay Bridge Series resumes at Oracle Park.	Angels: Canning (5-4, 5.07 ERA) takes the mound Friday at Tampa Bay for a road trip opener.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

SEATTLE -- — With how easy German Márquez was cruising through the Seattle Mariners lineup, perfection seemed entirely possible.	Márquez missed out on his bid to be perfect, settling instead for arguably his most dominant start of the season.	“I thought it might happen because I thought his stuff was good,” Rockies manager Bud Black said. “I mean the fastball was live, had velocity and movement, the breaking ball was sharp. He was throwing strikes and his pitch count was manageable. So yeah, so I did think about.”	Trevor Story homered twice, Márquez took a perfect game into the sixth inning and the Colorado Rockies beat the Seattle Mariners 5-2 on Wednesday for just their sixth road victory this season.	Story had a solo shot in the fourth and a two-run homer in the eighth. Brendan Rodgers also hit a two-run drive, more than enough offensive punch to back Márquez, whose perfect game was broken up by Taylor Trammell's solo homer.	“I thought about it, but it is what it is,” Márquez said. “It's baseball.”	Márquez has had several overpowering performances over the past five weeks, allowing one earned run or fewer in seven of his past nine starts. The only blemishes in that time has been two outings against Cincinnati, during which he allowed a combined 12 earned runs and 20 hits.	Márquez (6-6) allowed just two baserunners in eight innings against Seattle while striking out seven. He was perfect for 5 2/3 innings, balancing his fastball, slider and curve to induce plenty of weak contact.	“I didn’t think he was a sharp last start, but today I thought he was,” Black said. “The ball was down for the most part, threw some really good low fastballs in the mid 90s, the breaking ball was down, the breaking ball was sharp.”	Márquez's bid for perfection ended on the first pitch to Trammell, who smacked a hanging slider over the right field wall.	Kyle Seager had an RBI bunt single against the shift after J.P. Crawford doubled in the ninth. Seattle brought the tying run to the plate, but Daniel Bard struck out Jake Bauers to complete his 10th save.	The Mariners had their winning streak snapped at five games but still finished off a successful 7-2 homestand.	“We look at our homestand and we had a number of different players step up. Big hits, quality at bats,” Seattle manager Scott Servais said. “But there’s still plenty of room.”	Seattle starter Justus Sheffield (5-7) continued his rocky, homer-plagued season. He failed to make it five innings for the second time in three starts and was hit hard by the Rockies even if he allowed only four hits.	Rodgers’ long ball in the second was his fourth of the season and Story’s line drive shot to left field leading off the fourth was his seventh. Sheffield has allowed 13 home runs in 68 innings pitched. He allowed two homers in 55 1/3 innings last season.	Both Servais and Sheffield said mechanics have been an issue for the lefty.	“I just got to continue to work in between outings to where when I get out there to game action, it’s just compete from then on and you don’t think about mechanics,” Sheffield said.	STREAK ENDS	Ramiel Tapia's 18-game hitting streak came to an end. He grounded out four times — three times to third base — and walked in his five plate appearances. Tapia's streak was the second-longest in the majors this season.	WELCOME BACK	IF/OF Chris Owings appeared in his first game since April 9 after coming off the 60-day injured list. Owings was hitless in four at-bats with three strikeouts as the DH. Owings missed more than two months following left thumb surgery.	NO. 9 HITTER	The No. 9 hitter in Seattle’s lineup has homered in three straight games for the first time in 26 years. Shed Long Jr. homered from that spot in the previous two games and Trammell was hitting ninth Wednesday. The last time Seattle accomplished the feat was all by the same player, when Dan Wilson homered in three straight games in Sept. 10-12, 1995.	UP NEXT	Rockies: RHP Jon Gray (4-6, 4.29) is expected to return from the injured list and start Friday’s opener of a series in Milwaukee. Gray made a rehab start with Triple-A Albuquerque last Sunday after missing time with a right flexor strain. His last start came on June 4 against Oakland when he allowed five runs in 2 1/3 innings.	Mariners: Following a day off, the Mariners open a road trip against the White Sox on Friday. LHP Yusei Kikuchi (4-3, 3.46) will start the opener. Kikuchi has pitched seven innings in each of his past two starts and allowed one earned run.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

BALTIMORE -- — José Altuve silenced the booing fans at Camden Yards with a two-run homer, José Urquidy pitched seven innings of three-hit ball and the Houston Astros stretched their winning streak to 10 games by breezing past the Baltimore Orioles 13-0 Wednesday night.	Yordan Alvarez, Abraham Toro and Chas McCormick also homered for the Astros, who outscored the lowly Orioles 26-3 during a three-game sweep. Houston's 10-game run is its longest since May 2019 and two short of the club record.	“To me, we’re doing what we’re capable of doing and I still think we’ve got a couple of guys who can get better,” Astros manage Dusty Baker said. “The guys are feeling good about themselves and that's what you want.”	Altuve was greeted with jeers every time he stepped to the plate during the series, mostly because he was the Most Valuable Player during a 2017 season in which the Astros won the World Series but were later found to have been stealing signs. The Astros leadoff man has heard boos from opposing fans in almost every stadium this season, but Altuve has nevertheless hit 17 home runs, including a drive in the fourth inning  off Thomas Eshelman (0-1) that made it 6-0.	“They spoiled some good pitches and put some good swings on some balls that were in the zone,” Eshelman said.	Alvarez and Toro connected in the seventh off knuckleballer Mickey Jannis and McCormick added a solo shot in the eighth.	Urquidy (6-3) didn't need to be dominant on a night in which the Astros banged out 17 hits, but the right-hander nevertheless struck out six, walked one and permitted just one runner past second base. He's won six of his last seven decisions and gone seven innings in three straight starts.	“He had outstanding control,” Baker said. “He always has control, but tonight he had command. He threw some quality strikes. He’s getting better and better each outing.”	Baltimore has lost 13 of 14 and Thursday will seek to snap a 19-game skid on the road in Buffalo against the Toronto Blue Jays.	KNUCKLING UNDER	Jannis launched his big league career by striking out Alvarez, but ended up yielding seven runs and eight hits over 3 1/3 innings. The 33-year-old righty is the eighth Oriole to make his debut this season. “They were all over him after a good first inning,” manager Brandon Hyde said.	PICK YOUR POISON	In an effort to get MLB batting leader Michael Brantley to take a load off his feet, Baker started Alvarez in left field and used Brantley as the designated hitter. While conceding that Brantley is the better outfielder, Baker was willing to make that sacrifice on behalf of a player who was sidelined from May 25 to June 7 with tightness in his right hamstring.	“It has more to do with Michael, the workload on Michael’s legs,” Baker said. “Don’t forget he’s coming off that hammy. You’ve got to pick your poison. Do I give up some defense or do I take a chance on losing Michael? I’m more worried about that. We’re trying to protect Michael and keep his bat in the lineup at the same time."	Brantley went 2 for 4 to raise his batting average to .356 before leaving for a pinch hitter.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: OF  Kyle Tucker  was activated from the 10-day injured list following an unspecified illness. Houston made roster space by optioning C Garrett Stubbs to Triple-A Sugar Land. ... 3B Alex Bregman, who strained his left quad on June 17, probably won't be back until after the All-Star break. “It’s going to be at least two to three weeks or more,” Baker said. “These things don’t heal that quickly.”	Orioles: OF Anthony Santander was back in the lineup after missing two starts with a tender left ankle, an injury that will be monitored on a daily basis for the foreseeable future. “Right now he has good days and bad days,” Hyde said. “We're trying to manage it as best as we possibly can.”	UP NEXT	Astros: Luis Garcia (5-4, 2.82 ERA) faces host Detroit on Thursday night in the opener of a four-game series.	Orioles: Dean Kremer (0-6, 6.20) makes his 12th start of the season — and second in a row against Toronto — to help launch a four-game series.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

NEW YORK -- — Aroldis Chapman bent over sharply and cursed at himself after blowing a save with a four-pitch bases-loaded walk and falling behind on an infield single.	Just 13 minutes later, the closer and the rest of the Yankees were all smiles. Gary Sánchez's tying home run off Greg Holland and Luke Voit's winning single that landed inches from the top of the left-field fence sent them running onto the field  with yet another late come-from-behind win.	“I need to get in the weight room. These last two games I keep hitting the top of the wall,” Voit said with a chuckle after the Yankees beat the Kansas City Royals 6-5 Wednesday night in a game that see-sawed three times in the last two innings.	New York has won six of its last eight games, cutting a nine-game deficit in the AL East to 4 1/2 games behind first-place Boston ahead of the Yankees' first trip to Fenway Park this season. In five of the victories, the Yankees came from behind in the seventh inning or later.	New York came from behind three times Wednesday.	Ryan O'Hearn homered for the second straight day following his recall from the minors, putting Kansas City ahead with a two-run drive in the first off Michael King.	Clint Frazier tied the score in the fourth against Carlos Hernández with a two-run, opposite-field double off the base of the manual scoreboard in the right-field wall, which due to the coronavirus has not been used since 2019.	Carlos Santana gave the Royals a 3-2 lead in the eighth with the first home run off Zack Britton since the 2019 AL Division Series only for Rougned Odor to hit a two-run homer in the bottom half against Jake Brentz.	Chapman (5-2) converted his first 11 save chances but has blown three of his last eight. He allowed a one-out single to Michael A. Taylor and a two-out bloop single to Whit Merrifield that put runners at the corners.	Yankees manager Aaron Boone went to the mound, then returned to the dugout and ordered an intentional walk to Santana.	“Probably not really what Chapman wanted to do there,” Sánchez said.	Rookie Sebastian Rivero, a rookie who is 0 for 7 in his career and entered in the fourth inning after Salvador Pérez took a foul tip off his mask, came up with the bases loaded. Chapman threw a fastball in the dirt, then bounced a slider into Sánchez's chest protector and then another fastball that sent dust flying. Chapman fired a fastball about a foot outside for a four-pitch walk and screamed.	On the very next pitch, O'Hearn checked his swing and hit a slow roller to third, just beating DJ LeMahieu’s throw to first. When Chapman reached the dugout after Jarrod Dyson's inning-ending groundout, he slammed his glove.	But wait!	Aaron Judge struck out for the fourth time leading off the bottom half against Holland (2-3), who got his fifth save Tuesday night in the Royals' series-opening 6-5 win.	Sánchez lined a fastball into the left-field seats for his 12th homer, his seventh in his last 22 games.	“I pride myself in not making two-strike mistakes and that's what burned me with the first one," Holland said.	Giancarlo Stanton singled to right, pinch-runner Tyler Wade advanced on a wild pitch and up came Voit, who homered Tuesday in his return from the injured list but struck out three times Wednesday, stranding the bases loaded in the seventh.	Voit fouled off a pair of two-strike sliders and reached down for a curveball and turned it around at 105 mph, sending it 370 feet off the wall. Wade scored standing up with Voit's first game-ending hit in the majors and New York's sixth walk-off win this season.	“This is the type of win,” Voit said, “coming back twice and winning it in a big way, to get us back on a good hot streak and rolling into the second half of the season.”	Holland has blown four of nine save opportunities.	“That ball was supposed to be in the dirt,” Holland said. “I thought the pitch was pretty close to hitting the dirt, but it must not have been close enough.”	Kansas City walked 11 batters, its most since July 5, 2019, against Washington, and New York's most since April 9, 2017, at Baltimore. Danny Duffy lasted two innings and 42 pitches in his return from a left flexor strain that had sidelined him since May 12. Duffy walked three, as did Hernández. Scott Barlow and Brentz walked two apiece, and Josh Staumont one.	“Hopefully,” Boone said, “we can continue to carry this.”	BOOS	Fans booed umpires when they checked King for banned foreign substances after the second inning.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Royals: Pérez took a foul tip off the mask on Duffy’s fifth pitch of the game, with LeMahieu leading off the first. The 31-year-old Pérez, a six-time All-Star, has played in all 72 games this season. Metheny said he had a headache from the mask jamming his chin but was negative for a concussion.	Yankees: 3B Gio Urshela did not play, a day after he was hit in the left shin by Jake Brentz's pitch. The shin was swollen and sore.	UP NEXT	RHP Jameson Taillon (1-4, 5.59) is 0-2 in his last eight starts for the Yankees heading into Thursday’s series finale. Kansas City has lost the last three starts of RHP Brad Keller (6-7, 6.34) after winning the prior five.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

NEW YORK -- — With the arrival of Michael Conforto and a few other reinforcements, the banged-up New York Mets got back in the swing of things.	Francisco Lindor homered and drove in three runs, Conforto jolted New York's stagnant offense in his delayed return from injury and the Mets beat the Atlanta Braves 7-3 on Wednesday night.	“It was good to jump right into the action,” Conforto said.	Tylor Megill and Corey Oswalt came up from the minors to provide steady pitching for a New York staff ravaged by recent injuries, and the NL East leaders rebounded from consecutive shutouts to split the four-game series.	Leadoff man Jeff McNeil had three hits after coming off the injured list Monday, including a run-scoring single in the second inning for his first RBI since May 8. Lindor followed with his ninth homer of the season off Kyle Wright (0-1) to make it 5-0.	“Having McNeil and Conforto is going to be huge for us,” said Lindor, who batted between them as the top trio combined for seven hits, five runs and four RBI. “We had a great team approach.”	Edwin Díaz got five outs for his 16th save in 17 tries.	“We were very short,” Mets manager Luis Rojas said. “The guys are leaving their arms out there to get wins.”	Called up from Triple-A Syracuse earlier in the day as New York made eight roster moves, Oswalt (1-0) allowed one run over 2 1/3 innings of relief for his first major league win since 2018.	With the tying run at the plate, Oswalt picked off Ozzie Albies at first base to end the seventh.	“It's incredible,” Conforto said. “Every day it feels like we've got some new guys in here and they jump right in. They're here to do their job.”	Megill also was summoned from Triple-A to start in place of Joey Lucchesi, who is scheduled for season-ending Tommy John surgery Thursday. The right-hander permitted two runs and three hits with four strikeouts over 4 1/3 valuable innings in his major league debut.	“A lot of emotions. It was exciting. It was fun. It was competitive. Couldn't ask for anything more while I was out there,” said Megill, who didn't even have enough notice for family and friends to be on hand for his big night.	“I wanted to go full force and just go out there and make a statement and help the team win.”	When he was lifted, Megill got a pat on the chest from Lindor and a boisterous ovation from fans. Then he was checked by umpires for sticky stuff on his way off the field to a chorus of boos from the crowd of 15,645.	“He definitely had nerves going, but he didn't show them. He executed," Lindor said. “He stepped up for us.”	Freddie Freeman went 4 for 4 with a walk and Ender Inciarte hit a two-run homer off Megill in the fifth, but that was all he conceded.	“I'm impressed with his poise,” Rojas said. “He threw the ball so well.”	Conforto finished 2 for 4 with a walk and scored twice. He lined a double in the first to key a two-run inning that included Dominic Smith's RBI groundout.	Wright was tagged for five runs, four hits and three walks over two innings in a disappointing return from the minors. He was called up to start in place of injured Max Fried (blister).	“Stuff was flat. He just couldn't really get untracked and get anything going," Braves manager Brian Snitker said. “He's a young guy that's still trying to figure it out. I mean, we see the stuff and all — he just hasn't been able to put it together. I don't know. You just hope some day it clicks.”	Luis Guillorme doubled and reached on a perfect drag-bunt single for the Mets, scoring twice. James McCann had a double and an RBI single.	New York had dropped six of eight, totaling only 13 runs and getting shut out four times during that span.	“Once we have all the pieces of the puzzle, it’s going to be great to put it together,” Lindor said.	WAIT JUST A MINUTE	Conforto had been sidelined since straining his right hamstring May 16. He was ready to return Tuesday, but wasn’t activated after Syracuse’s game was postponed to allow for more COVID-19 testing and contact tracing within the organization. The right fielder spent last weekend on a rehab assignment with Syracuse, so the Mets said they decided not to reinstate him Tuesday “out of an abundance of caution.”	“It was definitely a rollercoaster,” Conforto said before the game, adding he tested negative three times.	FAMILY TIES	Megill’s brother, Trevor, pitched for the Chicago Cubs at Citi Field on June 14.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Braves: RF Ronald Acuña Jr. was scratched from the lineup before batting practice because of a stiff lower back. He is day-to-day. ... OF Guillermo Heredia (right wrist inflammation) sat out for the second consecutive game. ... RHP Huascar Ynoa (broken right hand) is playing catch and long toss.	Mets: RHP Marcus Stroman is optimistic he can make his next scheduled start Monday in Washington after an MRI showed no damage to his sore left hip. Stroman exited Tuesday's outing in the second inning. ... New York placed second-string catcher Tomás Nido on the 10-day injured list, retroactive to Tuesday, with a bruised right wrist. ... 3B Jonathan Villar (calf) sat out for the second consecutive game. An MRI came back clean, Rojas said, but Guillorme started at the hot corner again. ... CF Brandon Nimmo (finger) went 0 for 2 with a walk in a rehab game at Syracuse. He played five innings in center field. ... RHP Dellin Betances (shoulder impingement) pitched a scoreless inning for Syracuse in his fourth rehab outing. ... RHP Robert Gsellman (right lat strain) was transferred to the 60-day IL.	UP NEXT	Braves: A bullpen game Thursday night at Cincinnati in the opener of a four-game series.	Mets: Following a much-needed day off, the Mets begin a four-game set Friday against NL East rival Philadelphia with a single-admission doubleheader at Citi Field to make up an April 15 rainout. Taijuan Walker and David Peterson are scheduled to start for New York. Aaron Nola and Matt Moore are expected to pitch for the Phillies in a pair of seven-inning games.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- — Austin Meadows, Mike Zunino and Brandon Lowe homered to help the Tampa Bay Rays stop a seven-game losing streak by beating the AL East-leading Boston Red Sox 8-2 on Wednesday night.	“It's a relief, we shook hands after the game," Rays manager Kevin Cash said. “We haven't done it for a week.”	Rich Hill (6-2) struggled with his command but limited the Red Sox to one run over five innings. The 41-year old lefty, who threw 58 of 97 pitches for strikes, gave up three hits, five walks and had five strikeouts.	Rays rookie Wander Franco, who hit a three-run homer in his big league debut Tuesday, went 0 for 3 and walked twice.	The umpires had Rays reliever Diego Castillo change his hat before he pitched the ninth after meeting near the mound.	“They just recognized some wear and tear, like dirt mark on the bill of it and felt it was best to get him a new hat," Cash said. "It was not a substance issue, no.”	All four umpires met with Boston manager Alex Cora on the field right after the game ended.	“Just wanted to make sure what was the situation,” Cora said. “The crew said that the hat had some discolor. I don’t know where. It wasn’t sticky. It was just discolored. They wanted to make sure there was nothing weird going on. So they decided for him to switch the hat.”	“They explained the whole thing" Cora added. "No big deal.”	Major League Baseball instructed umpires to begin cracking down on the use of sticky foreign substances by pitchers on Monday.	“This is not baseball,” Hill said. “This is not what people buy a ticket to come and see. We don't want to turn baseball into Jerry Springer. We've got to get back to the game itself."	Umpire crew chief Tom Hallion said he noticed discoloration on the brim of the hat and added that it was not confiscated, just asked to be replaced.	“I inspected the hat and did not find any sticky substance,” Hallion said.	Xander Bogaerts and Christian Vázquez had RBI singles for the Red Sox, who had their lead over the Rays cut to a half-game.	Boston's Garrett Richards (4-5) struggled again, allowing five runs, three hits and four walks in 1 2/3 innings. He has given up 15 runs over 11 innings in last three starts.	Zunino connected on his 15th homer, a two-run drive, during a three-run second as the Rays took a 5-1 lead.	Franco displayed his speed when he reached safely on second baseman Kiké Hernández’s error on a routine-looking grounder in the second that allowed Lowe to score. Hernández bobbled the ball and spiked a throw to first with Franco moving quickly down the line.	Franco drew a two-out walk in the first before Meadows made it 2-1 on his 16th homer.	The 20-year old Franco was briefly checked by a trainer in the first after his helmet came off, hit the ground and then struck under his chin as he dove back to first on a pickoff attempt.	Lowe’s three-run homer off Matt Andriese put the Rays up 8-1 in the seventh.	Red Sox reliever Josh Taylor worked the sixth and extended his scoreless appearance streak to 21 games, covering 17 innings. It’s the longest stretch ever by a Boston left-hander.	NOT INQUIRING	Cora, who served a one-year suspension stemming from the sign-stealing scandal by the Houston Astros, doesn’t envision himself asking umpires to check for a sticky substance.	“Obviously I’m coming from a different situation than 28 other managers,” Cora said. “At one point, if we have to do it because it’s just out of control and we see it, then we’ll address it, but as of now I don’t see it.”	FRANCO FOCUS	Franco received over 100 text messages after Tuesday’s game, including from Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Ronald Acuña Jr. and Fernando Tatis Jr.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Red Sox: INF Christian Arroyo (right shin bone bruise) is still sore and was out of the lineup.	Rays: SS Taylor Walls (sore right wrist) didn’t start and his day to day.	UP NEXT	Boston RHP Nick Pivetta (6-3) will start the series finale Thursday night. RHP Michael Wacha (1-2) will get the start for the Rays.	------	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

MIAMI -- — Held homerless during a two-game visit to Marlins Park, the high-scoring Toronto Blue Jays departed from their blueprint and won with pitching.	Robbie Ray allowed one run in six innings and three relievers completed a five-hitter as Toronto beat Miami 3-1  Wednesday night to complete a sweep.	The Blue Jays began the series tied for the MLB lead in homers but were 4-21 when scoring three runs or fewer. They won 2-1 Tuesday and allowed only eight hits in the series.	“It's great that we can shut it down when the hitters are having a little bit of trouble," Ray said. “These are two really good wins.”	Toronto has won four in a row but remains fourth in the AL East.	Ray (5-3), coming off his shortest outing of the season, struck out six to increase his season total to 103 in 79 2/3 innings.	“My arm-side fastball was the best it has been all year,” the left-hander said. “I was able to drive that pitch down and away to some righties and get some outs away with the fastball. I was pretty happy with that.”	Jordan Romano pitched around a leadoff double in the ninth for his fifth save  in six chances, and his second in two nights.	Bo Bichette had two hits, an RBI and a run scored for the Blue Jays, who improved to 13-2 in interleague play, including 4-0 against Miami.	Starling Marte hit his sixth homer  in the sixth for the Marlins. They've been outscored 7-2 in their past three games, all losses.	“It has probably been the most frustrating thing for all of us as a group and as an offense, just not being able to find that consistency," manager Don Mattingly said.	The last-place Marlins are a season-worst 11 games under .500 at 31-42. They've lost 28 games by two runs or fewer.	Trevor Rogers (7-4) went five innings and gave up three runs, the most he has allowed since May 2, raising his ERA to 2.08. The left-hander struck out six and became the first Marlins rookie to fan 100 batters in his first 15 games of a season.	The Blue Jays scored twice in the first off Rogers, who came into the game leading all MLB rookies in wins, ERA and strikeouts. Teoscar Hernández hit an RBI double, and George Springer's grounder brought home another run.	“We saw he throws a lot of strikes, and we tried to be aggressive,” Hernández said.	LAYOFF	The Marlins want to limit Rogers' innings. He pitched for the first time in eight days and felt it early.	“Out of sync a little bit," he said. “Adrenaline definitely pumping.”	GETTING GOING	Springer went 0 for 3 and is hitless in seven at-bats since returning from a seven-week stint on the injured list.	“When you miss that much time, it's not easy to come into big league games and hit line drives,” Toronto manager Charlie Montoyo said. “It’s going to take awhile.”	REVERSALS	First base umpire Ryan Wills had two calls overturned by replay in the first inning. Each time he ruled the batter beat out a grounder to the first baseman, with the pitcher late covering the base. Each time, replay determined the batter was out.	Wills also had a safe call reversed in the eighth.	CRACKDOWN	Ray had no complaint about the umpires’ inspections to eliminate sticky substances.	“Pretty simple, pretty quick, pretty painless,” he said.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Blue Jays: LHP Steven Matz (COVID-related) is scheduled to throw a bullpen session Thursday.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays: They begin a 10-game, 11-day homestand in Buffalo, New York, on Thursday, when LHP Anthony Kay (0-2, 6.43) is scheduled to start against Baltimore.	Marlins: They begin a four-game series Thursday at home against Washington, with RHP Cody Poteet (2-2, 3.90) scheduled to start.	------	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP--Sports	------	Follow Steven Wine on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Steve--Wine	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- — Major league rookie home run leader Adolis García went deep twice for his 19th and 20th, Brock Holt had a tiebreaking RBI single in the seventh inning and the Texas Rangers beat the Oakland Athletics 5-3 on Wednesday night.	The Rangers had hits on the first three pitches from Oakland reliever Yusmeiro Petit to start the seventh after the A's scored three runs in the top of the inning to erase a 2-0 deficit.	Nate Lowe homered into the Texas bullpen in right-center field for his 10th, Eli White lined a double to left-center and Holt blooped the third pitch from Petit (7-1) down the line in left to bring home White and give the Rangers a 4-3 lead.	“After giving up three, you kind of come back in and hang your head a little bit,” Texas manager Chris Woodward said. “Three straight pitches, just like that you're back in the lead. It was good to see our guys have an approach against a guy that throws the ball over the plate, be ready to hit.”	The first loss of the season for Petit — and just his second over two years — came in the 36-year-old right-hander's majors-leading 37th appearance.	“He throws a first-pitch changeup and usually that's a pretty good popup pitch for him,” Oakland manager Bob Melvin said. “He just didn't get it in the spot he wanted to. Maybe not his best location of the year. It doesn't happen often when he's on the mound.”	Sean Murphy opened Oakland's three-run seventh with a 443-foot home run to center field after García had put Texas ahead 2-0 with a solo shot that barely cleared the same fence in the sixth. Skye Bolt and Matt Chapman added RBI singles.	García connected on another two-out solo shot in the eighth for the 28-year-old Cuban's third multihomer game of the season. García, who also leads MLB rookies in RBI (52) and total bases (138) already had the Texas record for homers by a rookie before the All-Star break.	Brett Martin (2-2) pitched a perfect eighth thanks to diving catches on consecutive plays by right fielder Joey Gallo and White in left. Joely Rodríguez finished for his first career save, allowing an infield single in the ninth.	Texas starter Mike Foltynewicz, who had the second-highest ERA among AL qualifiers at 5.59 coming in, took a shutout into the seventh.	The right-hander was replaced after allowing Murphy's homer and a double to Elvis Andrus, who is playing his first series in Texas since the longtime Rangers shortstop was traded in the offseason.	After getting a popout, Texas reliever Spencer Patton allowed consecutive singles to Bolt, Tony Kemp and Chapman, who extended his hitting streak to 11 games while giving the A's a brief lead.	SOLID AGAIN	The Oakland rally had rookie James Kaprielian in line for a victory after the right-hander allowed two runs in six innings. The game was scoreless with two outs in the fifth when Johan Heim doubled in a run from first against the right-hander. Kaprielian hasn't allowed more than five hits in any of his eight career starts.	“Leaves with a lead,” Melvin said. “After we score three runs, we really feel like we're in a pretty good position to win the game. He's been real consistent for us.”	NEW YORK, NEW YORK	García's 20 homers before the All-Star break are the most for an AL rookie since Aaron Judge hit 30 for the Yankees in 2017.	ROSTER MOVES	The Rangers brought up two relievers from Triple-A Round Rock in lefty Wes Benjamin and right-hander Joe Barlow, who is awaiting his major league debut. The Rangers sent right-hander Demarcus Evans to Round Rock and designated right-hander Brett de Geus for assignment. The move with the 23-year-old de Geus, a Rule 5 draft pick from the Los Angeles Dodgers in December, was made to get Barlow on the 40-man roster.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: OF David Dahl, on the injured list since May 26 with a left rib cage injury, was transferred from Round Rock to Double-A Frisco to continue his rehab assignment. Dahl made two starts at DH and one in left field	UP NEXT	Oakland RHP Chris Bassitt (7-2, 3.40 ERA) is set to face LHP Kolby Allard (2-2, 2.93) in the finale of the four-game series Thursday. Bassitt has won seven consecutive decisions since losing his first two starts. Allard is 1-2 with a 2.70 ERA in four starts since opening the season with 10 relief appearances.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.

SAN DIEGO -- — The last time the San Diego Padres swept the Los Angeles Dodgers at Petco Park, in September 2010, right-hander Joe Musgrove was just starting his senior year at Grossmont High in suburban El Cajon.	When the Padres got their most recent sweep of LA, at Dodger Stadium in April 2013, Musgrove was still three years away from making his big league debut.	So yeah, it's a big deal for the hometown kid to be part of a series that had Petco Park rocking for three straight nights.	“I feel like the rivalry is at its best that it’s ever been,” Musgrove said after the Padres hit three solo home runs off reigning NL Cy Young Award winner Trevor Bauer and beat the Dodgers 5-3 Wednesday night for their first three-game sweep of the NL West rivals in eight seasons.	“It's a pretty level playing field between the two teams and I feel like we’re starting to show them that you’re not going to walk all over us this year and that we're going to fight, we've got the pieces to do it, and now it's about going out and doing it," said Musgrove, who got a no-decision after pitching six strong innings. “It feels good to be part of that."	The game ended in front of a sellout crowd of 43,961 when pinch-hitter Albert Pujols lined out to third baseman Manny Machado, who finished off a tremendous series defensively by doubling Will Smith off second. That earned Mark Melancon his major league-leading 23rd save.	San Diego is 7-3 this season against the Dodgers, including winning four straight, and has won two of the three series against the eight-time defending division champions. The Dodgers swept the Padres in the NL Division Series in October en route to winning the World Series.	San Diego has won seven straight games overall, including a four-game sweep of the Cincinnati Reds, after losing 13 of their previous 17.	“We've got areas to improve at and we are going to be a better team as the season gets going and down the stretch,” manager Jayce Tingler said. “I don't want to put a ceiling or a cap on what we're capable of because this is the most talented group I've been around. ... I do believe our best ball is still ahead of us, that's for sure."	Trent Grisham drew a go-ahead, bases-loaded walk in the eighth.	With the score tied at 3, Jake Cronenworth, who homered in the first, started the winning rally with a leadoff double off Blake Treinen (1-3) that went off the glove of leaping right fielder Matt Beaty. Machado, who also homered in the first, singled. Victor Gonzalez came on and allowed Eric Hosmer’s sacrifice bunt. Wil Myers was intentionally walked to load the bases before Gonzalez walked Grisham to bring in Cronenworth. Victor Caratini added a sacrifice fly.	Cronenworth and Machado connected back-to-back with two outs in the first against Bauer, who won the 2020 NL Cy Young Award while with Cincinnati. Caratini gave the Padres a 3-2 lead with a leadoff homer in the seventh.	The Dodgers tied it in the eighth when Max Muncy doubled and scored on Justin Turner’s opposite-field single to right.	Bauer allowed thee runs and five hits in six-plus innings, struck out 10 and walked four.	After allowing the consecutive homers in the first, Bauer settled down and retired nine of the next 10 batters before getting into and out of a jam in the fourth. After Bauer struck out Machado and Eric Hosmer, he walked Myers and allowed a ground-rule double to Grisham. Caratini was intentionally walked to get to Musgrove, who struck out looking.	Musgrove retired nine of the first 10 Dodgers before Los Angeles broke through in the fourth. Muncy hit a leadoff double, Cody Bellinger — activated earlier in the day — walked with one out and Smith hit an RBI single. First baseman Hosmer went for a reverse double play on Beaty's grounder and forced Smith at second but shortstop Fernando Tatis Jr.'s return throw skipped past Musgrove for an error and Bellinger scored.	Musgrove, who threw the Padres' first no-hitter on April 9, allowed two runs, one earned, and two hits in six innings. He struck out five and walked two.	“I’m a Padre fan. I grew up in San Diego, so I’ve been living this for a long time and I’ve been watching these series go down and it’s kind of the dream that you get to participate in an action-packed series like this,” Musgrove said.	Tim Hill (4-3) got the win.	COMPLIMENTING MACHADO	Machado homered twice this series and played stellar defense.

NEW YORK -- — Yankees hitters have clawed out of an early season slump with a string of clutch, late-game hits.	The Bronx Bombers needed no such fireworks in this one — a start-to-finish shellacking that's inspiring confidence ahead of a weekend series in Boston.	“It's good to see these guys starting to get a little bit of that swagger,” manager Aaron Boone said.	Aaron Judge homered for the first of his three hits, Gary Sánchez connected for the second straight game and New York got its first blowout victory in a month, beating the Kansas City Royals 8-1 Thursday.	Judge got the Yankees started with a solo shot in the first, Luke Voit had another in the third and Sánchez blew the game open with a three-run drive in the sixth.	New York had not won by more than four runs since a 7-0 rout of the Chicago White Sox on May 22.	The Yankees have won seven of nine, and seven of their eight wins before Wednesday had come via comebacks. Boone admitted it felt like a long time since New York's last easy victory, adding that the morale boost — along with all the rested relievers — could benefit the Yankees at Fenway Park.	“We've obviously played a ton of close games this year, which I believe is going to serve us well moving forward,” Boone said. “But it is nice, definitely, to have these types of games.”	New York hasn't played in front of fans in Boston since 2019. The Red Sox swept three games at Yankee Stadium in early June and entered Friday 4 1/2 games ahead of New York for the AL East lead.	“It’s going to be fun,” said Giancarlo Stanton, who had three hits. “We’re ready to go.”	Jameson Taillon (2-4) matched a season high by pitching 6 1/3 innings and ended an eight-start winless streak. The right-hander allowed a run, five hits and two walks while striking out six on 96 pitches.	“I thought his curveball was as good as I've seen it,” Boone said.	Nestor Cortes Jr. finished out the six-hitter with 2 2/3 scoreless innings. Brett Gardner made a sliding catch in center on Whit Merrifield’s popup for the final out.	Brad Keller (6-8) allowed four runs in five innings for Kansas City, which was trying to win a series against New York for the first time since 2015. Keller walked four and allowed nine hits, including the homers by Judge and Voit.	“Just felt like I didn’t have anything behind my pitches,” Keller said.	The Yankees have 29 homers in their past 14 games after a notably punchless start to the season — they totaled 11 in the 14 games prior to this stretch.	Sánchez hit a tying homer in the bottom of the ninth Wednesday, setting up Voit’s game-ending single in a 6-5 win. He followed up with two hits Thursday, raising his average to .338 in his past 23 games with eight homers and 18 RBI. The homer was his 13th of the season, second on the team behind Judge’s 16.	Judge walked twice and reached base in all five of his plate appearances. Rougned Odor also had three hits.	Royals pitchers walked five Thursday and combined to issue 24 free passes during the three-game series.	Sebastian Rivero got his first major league hit for Kansas City with an RBI double in the fifth. Rivero also drew a tying, bases-loaded walk against Aroldis Chapman in the ninth inning Wednesday.	NO EYES UP THERE	Royals third baseman Hanser Alberto lost Odor’s third-inning popup in the sun, and it dropped for an infield single. Alberto had sunglasses in the field with him, but had them resting on top of his hat.	STOPPING THE RUN	A fan ran onto the field during the eighth inning and was tackled almost immediately by a security guard.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Royals: C Salvador Pérez was the Royals’ designated hitter as planned a day after taking a foul tip off his mask. Pérez had a headache and later left Wednesday’s game, but it was determined he did not have a concussion. He has played in every game this season.	Yankees: 3B Gio Urshela was held out of the lineup for the second day in a row after being hit in the shin by a pitch. He received treatment early Thursday, and Boone said he was available to pinch hit but not to run the bases.	UP NEXT	Royals: LHP Mike Minor (6-4, 4.48) is set to pitch at Texas for the first time since the Rangers traded him away last season. Minor was 26-23 with a 4.00 ERA over three seasons with Texas. He made his only All-Star team there in 2019, a career year when he struck out 200 batters. RHP Dane Dunning (2-6, 4.71) starts for the Rangers.	Yankees: New York RHP Domingo Germán (4-4, 4.17) is slated to face Boston LHP Martín Pérez (5-4, 4.32).	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BUFFALO, N.Y. -- — Lourdes Gurriel Jr. hit his first grand slam in a six-run first inning, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. took over sole possession of the home run lead with his 24th, and the Toronto Blue Jays extended Baltimore's road losing streak to 20 games by routing the Orioles 9-0 on Thursday night.	Baltimore tied the 1916 Philadelphia Athletics for the second-longest road skid in AL history, trailing only the 22 losses in a row by the 1943 A's. The Orioles are an AL-worst 23-52, including 11-26 away from home.	The Orioles have lost 14 of their last 15 overall. Combined with Wednesday's 13-0 defeat to Houston, the franchise has been shut out in consecutive losses of at least nine runs since the St. Louis Browns were swept in a doubleheader 12-0 and 14-0 at Detroit on Sept. 22, 1936.	“I’m seeing that we’re down a touchdown early on back-to-back nights,” Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. “It's not easy when you’re battling from so far behind so early in the game.”	Toronto has won a season-high five straight, following a five-game losing streak. The Blue Jays improved to 4-5 at Sahlen Field, the home of their Triple-A team, after going 10-11 at TD Ballpark, their spring training ballpark. They are 24-19 on the road.	Anthony Kay (1-2) and four relievers combined on a seven-hitter, the fifth shutout for Blue Jays pitchers this season and the sixth time the Orioles were blanked. Making his fifth start this season, Kay allowed five hits in five innings, walked two and matched his career high with eight strikeouts. His first seven outs were on strikeouts.	“When you have a six-run lead after the first inning, you kind of have to be more aggressive with the fastball and hopefully get deeper into games,” Kay said.	Dean Kremer (0-7) gave up six runs, two hits and a career-high five walks while getting just one out, his fewest in 16 career big league starts. The 25-year-old right-hander's season ERA rose to 7.25.	Kremer threw 19 pitches to his first three batters, walking all three on full counts. Teoscar Hernández hit a go-ahead single, Randal Grichuk had an RBI grounder, Kremer forced a run with a full-count walk to Cavan Biggio and Gurriel hit the next pitch, a belt-high cutter, to left for his 11th homer this season.	Joe Panik walked, and Kremer was pulled after 39 pitches, just 17 of them strikes.	“He was kind of wild,” Gurriel said through a translator about Kremer. “Lots of walks, not locating his pitches. I was looking for a pitch right down the zone, so I can get good contact. That's what it was.”	Kremer couldn't pinpoint what his problems were, but he was frustrated by his performance.	“I don’t think it’s ever been that bad,” Kremer said. “Five walks, that’s embarrassing on my part and for our team. That's unacceptable. I’ll go back and watch video and come to a conclusion, and work through the steps to get better.”	Toronto manager Charlie Montoyo cited the patience of his team, which entered the game with the second-highest batting average in the league along with the most home runs.	“Being patient was the key,” Montoyo said. “We grinded out the at-bats. If they didn’t get the pitch, they took the walk and left it for the next guy. That's why we ended up scoring that many runs.”	Guerrero homered in the third off Adam Plutko and moved one ahead of Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Angels	Reese McGuire had three hits for Toronto.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Orioles: RHP John Means (shoulder) began playing catch, and Hyde expects Means to return shortly after the All-Star break.	Blue Jays: LHP Steven Matz (COVID-19) has been cleared to join the team and threw 50-60 pitches before the game. Montoyo said there was a good chance Matz would start against Seattle when the Mariners visit Buffalo next Tuesday-Thursday. ... OF George Springer (quadriceps strain) sat out after playing the previous two games in Miami this week. “He's 100% healthy but not 100% built up,” Montoyo said.	UP NEXT	Friday's second game of the four-game weekend series will feature Orioles RHP Matt Harvey (3-9, 7.80 ERA) against Toronto rookie RHP Alek Manoah (1-0, 4.18). Manoah was ejected from his last start on Saturday at Baltimore upon hitting Maikel Franco with a pitch after allowing back-to-back home runs. Harvey is 0-8 with with an 11.49 ERA in his last nine starts.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CINCINNATI -- — Tony Santillan allowed one run in six innings to earn his first major league victory and Nick Castellanos hit a two-run homer, lifting the Cincinnati Reds to a 5-3 victory over the Atlanta Braves on Thursday night. ,	Santillan (1-1) gave up three hits, struck out eight and walked three in his third big league start. He also doubled in the third inning for his first career hit.	“Tony was very happy not only to get a win but he pitched very well," Reds manager David Bell said. "He got his first hit. It was a big night for him.”	Major League Baseball’s crackdown on the use of sticky substances continued Thursday, with umpires making random checks of pitchers. Braves manager Brian Snitker deflected any notion of suspicion with left-hander Tyler Matzek, who threw 21 pitches and walked three in two-thirds of an inning in relief of starter Jesse Chavez (0-1).	Matzek averaged 2,575 rpm on his slider, 2,090 on his fastball, and 2,477 with his curve — all below his season averages of 2,997, 2,487, and 3,303. It was his second outing since the new rules were implemented.	“He just couldn’t get ahold of the ball,” Snitker said. “I don’t know why.”	The Braves, who score nearly half their runs via home runs, went ahead 1-0 on Freddie Freeman's 17th homer in the first. But that was the only run Atlanta could manage against Santillan.	“This, for me at least, it’s the top of the top to get a win by my name,” Santillan said. “I don't show a lot of emotion on the field. It was good vibes all the way around after I hit the double.”	Brad Brach, the Reds' fourth pitcher of the night, got three outs for his first save of the season.	It was a bullpen day for the Braves, who summoned the 37-year-old Chavez (0-1) from Triple-A Gwinnett to make his 482nd major league appearance and first start since 2019. He allowed two runs in 2 1/3 innings to take the loss.	The Braves used six pitchers on the night.	“It wasn't easy piecing things together,” Snitker said. “We did a good job navigating the whole thing and kept ourselves in the game.”	The Reds were clinging to a 2-1 lead when Castellanos delivered the big blow, his two-run blast off Luke Jackson in the seventh. Castellanos drove in four runs.	“Those are the spots I have to better in,” Castellanos said. "I needed to be better with runners on base.”	Ozzie Albies hit a solo home run off Tejay Antone in the eighth.	NO RELIEF	The Reds’ struggling bullpen took another hit on Thursday when right-hander Lucas Sims was placed on the 10-day injured list with a sprained right elbow. Sims is 4-1 with a 5.02 ERA and 44 strikeouts in 28 2/3 innings. He is expected to miss up to four weeks.	“There was one night in San Diego (last week) where he felt like he slept on his elbow wrong, then he bounced back,” Bell said.	MAKING MOVES	To make room on the roster for Chavez, the Braves optioned right-handers Kyle Wright and Ty Tice to Triple-A Gwinnett and transferred left-hander Tucker Davidson and catcher Alex Jackson to the 60-day injured list. Right-hander Tanner Roark also was selected from Triple-A.	TRAINERS ROOM	Braves: OF Ronald Acuna Jr. was out of the lineup for the second straight day with a stiff back. “He's still sore,” Snitker said. “They worked on him today. Hopefully he'll be back in there tomorrow. It's a day-to-day thing.” Acuna was scratched from his start Wednesday.	Reds: RHP Sonny Gray was scratched from his rehab start Thursday at Triple-A Louisville after he woke up with a sore back Wednesday morning. Gray, on the 10-day injured list since June 9 with a right groin injury, had his start pushed back to Saturday.	UP NEXT	Right-hander Vladimir Gutierrez (3-1, 3.86 ERA) makes his sixth major-league appearance after becoming the 19th pitcher in Reds franchise history with at least three wins in his first four starts since Tom Shearn in 2007. The Braves will counter with left-hander Drew Smyly (0-1, 4.70 ERA) who'll be making his 13th start.	—	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- — Kevin Kiermaier broke up a combined no-hit bid by the Boston Red Sox with a one-out double in the eighth inning and Manuel Margot scored on a wild pitch in the ninth to give the Tampa Bay Rays a 1-0 victory Thursday night.	Margot got Tampa Bay’s second hit, a two-out single in the ninth off Matt Barnes (3-2). He stole second and went to third on a throwing error by catcher Christian Vázquez.	Joey Wendle was intentionally walked, and Margot dashed home on Barnes’ wild pitch with Francisco Mejía batting.	“We really didn't have an offense going,” Margot said through a translator. “I was just trying to be aggressive.”	Margot came off the bench to pinch-hit in the seventh and was intentionally walked.	J.P. Feyereisen (4-1), the fifth Tampa Bay pitcher, worked the ninth inning of a four-hitter.	Kiermaier lined his opposite-field double to left off Darwinzon Hernández, the third Red Sox pitcher. The Gold Glove center fielder also threw out a runner at the plate in the seventh.	“It was a tied ballgame,” Kiermaier said. “We were just trying to stay the course and try and get something going.”	Boston starter Nick Pivetta was pulled with a runner on second and two outs in the seventh after throwing 100 pitches. His career high is 116.	Josh Taylor, who had his 22nd consecutive scoreless appearance, got the final out in the seventh before giving way to Hernández.	“To be honest with you, it was the right call. It made the most sense,” said Pivetta, who wanted to stay in the game. “We're all about winning.”	Pivetta finished with eight strikeouts, two walks and one hit batter. He joined Babe Ruth, on May 20, 1916, against the St. Louis Browns, as the only Red Sox pitchers to be removed with a no-hitter after six or more innings.	“It was amazing,” Boston manager Alex Cora said. “He was into it.”	Boston was trying to throw the seventh no-hitter in the majors this season. That would have matched 1990, 1991, 2012 and 2015 for the most since 1900, one shy of the record eight in 1884 — the first season overhand pitching was allowed.	Despite a tough loss that dropped the Red Sox a half-game behind first-place Tampa Bay in the AL East, Cora saw a lot of positives.	“A lot of people, they didn't believe in this team before the season," he said. “I think the way we played against these guys tonight shows how good we are. We have a lot of work to do, we know that. We belong in the conversation, we really do.”	“It's going to be a fun summer in Boston,” Cora added.	Tampa Bay starter Michael Wacha, who took a no-hitter into the fifth, allowed one hit and two walks in five innings. He had seven strikeouts.	Vázquez got the game’s first hit with two outs in the fifth when he lifted a soft fly ball to center on a half-swing against an 88 mph changeup.	Vázquez stole second and went to third on Mejía’s throwing error but was stranded when Bobby Dalbec struck out.	Hunter Renfroe had a leadoff double to deep center against Ryan Thompson in the seventh but was thrown out at the plate by Kiermaier on Vázquez’s single.	The seventh ended when Vázquez got picked off second by Mejía.	HAT FLAP	Rays reliever Diego Castillo said through a translator that he wasn’t worried when umpires confiscated his cap due to a discolored spot before pitching the ninth Wednesday night because there were no illegal substances on it.	“That’s the hat I’ve been using all season,” Castillo said. “I think it was just worn out because of the rosin I had consistently touching it.”	Castillo said the cap was returned to him but he can’t wear it.	HOMECOMNG	Los Angeles Angels manager Joe Maddon, who led the Rays to the 2008 AL pennant, will manage his second series at Tampa Bay as an opposing skipper this weekend and first since being with Chicago Cubs in September 2017.	SPECIAL NIGHT	The Red Sox will honor Dustin Pedroia during pregame ceremonies before Friday night’s game against the New York Yankees. Pedroia spent his entire 17-year pro career in the Boston organization.	NO-HIT RUNDOWN	The no-hitters this season were thrown by San Diego’s Joe Musgrove (April 9), Carlos Rodón of the Chicago White Sox (April 14), Baltimore’s John Means (May 5), Cincinnati’s Wade Miley (May 7), Detroit’s Spencer Turnbull (May 18) and the New York Yankees’ Corey Kluber (May 19).	In addition, Arizona’s Madison Bumgarner pitched a seven-inning hitless game in a doubleheader on April 25 that is not recognized as a no-hitter by Major League Baseball.	The Astros threw the most recent combined no-hitter in the majors, when Aaron Sanchez, Will Harris, Joe Biagini and Chris Devenski blanked Seattle on Aug. 3, 2019.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Red Sox: INF Christian Arroyo (bruised right knee) was placed on the 10-day injured list.	Rays: SS Taylor Walls (right wrist tendinitis) went on the 10-day IL. He got a cortisone shot Wednesday.	UP NEXT	Red Sox: LHP Martín Pérez (5-4) and Yankees RHP Domingo Germán (4-4) are Friday night’s starters.	Rays: LHP Josh Fleming (6-4) will start or follow an opener Friday night against Angels RHP Griffin Canning (5-4).	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

DETROIT -- — Carlos Correa had three hits, walked twice and drove in three runs, helping the Houston Astros beat the Detroit Tigers 12-3 Thursday night to extend their winning streak to 11.	“This has obviously been a lot of fun,” Correa said. “I feel really good, and everyone is getting good at-bats. The pitchers have been great, and we're all making plays.”	Houston's streak is one shy of the team record, set in 1999 and matched in 2004 and 2018. The Astros have outscored opponents 91-24 during the winning run.	“This team expects to win, so they aren't really talking much about a winning streak,” Astros manager Dusty Baker said. “We're hitting the ball well and we're getting pitch counts up by the fifth or sixth inning. That's a huge advantage.”	The Astros scored loaded the bases in six innings, including each from the second through the sixth. They scored twice in each inning from the second through the fifth, and finished with 18 hits, six walks and 28 baserunners.	“Everyone is working together to do this,” Astros catcher Martín Maldonado said. “We're seeing the ball well and we're getting big hits.”	Luis García (6-4) won his fourth straight start, allowing two runs and seven hits in six innings.	“I think Luis should be an All-Star,” Correa said. “He deserves it with the way he pitches every time he's out there.”	José Ureña (2-8) retired the side on five pitches in the first inning but threw 77 more without getting out of the fourth. He allowed six runs — four earned — eight hits and two walks in 3 2/3 innings to fall to 0-4 with a 12.89 ERA since returning from a forearm strain on June 6.	“I don't know if it is a physical issue or a mental issue, but he hasn't been the same since the injury,” Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said. “Whatever the reason, the way he's throwing is a concern.”	Ureña, making his first start since umpires started checking pitchers for grip enhancers, had an 8% drop on the average spin rate on both his four-seam fastball and sinker and a 12% drop on his slider.	“That didn't have any impact on me,” said Ureña, whose spin rates dropped again after being down in his previous start. “I felt good, but I moved to the third-base side a little, so I think the angle might be the difference.”	Houston loaded the bases with two outs in the second, thanks to two walks and an error, and Maldonado hit a two-run single.	Álvarez hit an RBI grounder in the third and Ureña forced in a run when he hit Abraham Toro with a pitch with the bases loaded. It could have been worse for Ureña; Robel García hit a line drive off first baseman Jonathan Schoop's glove, but the ball deflected to second baseman Willi Castro, who made the catch.	Akil Badoo cut the deficit to 4-1 with an RBI double in the third, but Gurriel hit an RBI double in the fourth and Correa chased Ureña with an RBI single.	Detroit loaded the bases in the bottom half, but Nomar Mazara was picked off second by Maldonado from behind the plate, and Harold Castro grounded out.	Correa hit a two-run single in the fifth, and left fielder Michael Brantley robbed Jonathan Schoop of a two-run homer in the bottom half.	“That's a big moment because we're trying to get anything going,” Hinch said. “I didn't think it was gone off the bat, but it started carrying. I saw Brantley getting set for a jump, and I just hoped it was going to get over his glove.”	Alvarez hit a grand slam off Bryan Garcia in the ninth, leading Hinch to move shortstop Harold Castro to the mound. Castro has pitched three times this season, accumulating 2 2/3 innings without a hit or a run.	Under the new directive, Castro was checked for illegal substances after finishing the inning.	UP NEXT	Detroit and Houston are scheduled to play the second game of a four-game series on Friday, although the weather forecast is for heavy rain. Framber Valdéz (4-0, 1.67) is to start for Houston against Detroit's Wily Peralta (0-1, 7.11).	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

MIAMI -- — Kyle Schwarber homered twice, raising his season total to 21 by hitting 12 in his past 13 games, and the Washington Nationals beat the Miami Marlins 7-3 Thursday night for their 10th win in 11 games.	Schwarber led off the first pulling a hanging curveball from Cody Poteet (2-3) to right for his fifth leadoff home run this season.	Josh Harrison singled with one out in the second, Victor Robles walked, and with two outs Schwarber sent a 0-2 fastball over the wall in center for a 4-0 lead.	“You’re not going up there expecting to hit home runs every time you’re up at the plate,” Schwarber said. “But hitting a home run when you’re locked in the plate, good things happen.”	Schwarber became the first player in major league history to homer 11 times in a 13-game span from the No. 1 slot in the batting order, according to STATS. He became the fourth player with eight home runs and 15 RBI in a five-game span, joining Shawn Green, Manny Ramirez and Frank Howard.	“When he’s like that, you don’t say much to him,” Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. “You let him go out there and play the game and let him get his swings. He’s been awesome getting us going. He’s knocked in some big runs for us. Hopefully he’s hot for a while.”	Juan Soto added the first of his two RBI doubles later in the inning.	Joe Ross (4-7) allowed four hits in seven scoreless inning, helping Washington extend its winning streak to five.	“It’s a little more satisfying that we’re going out there and winning baseball games,” Schwarber said. “I’m not the only component to this – trust me.”	Poteet gave up five runs, six hits and four walks in three innings. The 26-year-old rookie right-hander is 0-3 in his last four starts after going 2-0 in his first three big league outings.	“I just haven't been sharp,” Poteet said. “Definitely not the start you want.”	Miami has lost four straight, scoring five runs during the slide.	“The five early obviously hurt us,” Marlins manager Don Mattingly said. “The way we’ve been swinging the bats, it doesn’t put you in a good spot.”	Jazz Chisholm hit a three-run homer in the eighth against Justin Miller, Chisholm’s ninth homer and first since June 10.	MOMENT OF SILENCE	Before the national anthem, there was a moment of silence for the victims of the condo building that collapsed Thursday in Surfside, Florida. The coastal town adjacent to Miami Beach is 13 miles from the Marlins stadium.	ROSS GIVES RELIEVERS A NEEDED REST	The lengthy outing from Ross provided the Nationals’ bullpen needed rest. Martinez used seven relievers in Wednesday’s 13-12 win at Philadelphia.	“I couldn’t really tell you in the first today is going to be a good day,” Ross said. “You have to think that way and hopefully it turns out like that.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Nationals: 1B Josh Bell (right side discomfort) was a late scratch and will undergo an MRI Friday, Martinez said. RHP Stephen Strasburg (neck strain) has been throwing from 150 feet with increased intensity but there is no timetable on when he might throw from a mound.	Marlins: RHP Jordan Holloway (groin) was activated from the injured list and optioned to Triple-A Jacksonville.	UP NEXT	Nationals: LHP Jon Lester (1-2, 3.96) will start the second game of the series Friday night.	Marlins: RHP Pablo López (3-4, 2.86) starts Friday after pitching seven shutout innings against the Chicago Cubs on June 19.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

MINNEAPOLIS -- — Eddie Rosario broke an eighth-inning tie with a two-run single and the Cleveland Indians defeated the Minnesota Twins 4-1 on Thursday night.	Rosario, who spent six seasons with the Twins, was playing his first game in Minnesota since he signed with Cleveland in the offseason.	Austin Hedges and Cesar Hernandez started the eighth with singles off reliever Jorge Alcala (1-2). Amed Rosario then grounded into what was initially ruled a double play, but after a replay review umpires ruled he beat the relay to first.	With runners at the corners and one out, Twins manager Rocco Baldelli elected to intentionally walk Jose Ramirez, the Indians’ home run and RBI leader, to fill the bases.	Eddie Rosario then lined Taylor Rogers’ first pitch into center field to put Cleveland on top 3–1. Another run scored on Bobby Bradley’s RBI groundout.	“I love this moment. I love when they change the pitcher for me, lefty-to-lefty, late innings,” Eddie Rosario said. “I want to (give) everything I have in this moment.”	Baldelli refused to second-guess his decision to walk Ramirez and have Rogers face Rosario.	“Eddie kind of likes those moments, but I’m going to bet on (Rogers) every time,” Baldelli said. “Rog is as good a left-hander out of the bullpen as you’re going to find anywhere in baseball ... and in spots like that, he comes up big the vast, vast majority of the time.”	The ex-Twin said he expected Baldelli to make that move.	“I saw Rogers earlier in the bullpen and I know he’s coming to me,” Eddie Rosario said, “but I’m ready.”	Blake Parker (1-0) earned the win with one scoreless inning of relief. Brian Shaw pitched a perfect eighth and James Karinchak picked up his ninth save with a scoreless ninth inning.	Minnesota manufactured its only run in the first, thanks in part to mistakes by starter J.C. Mejía. Leadoff hitter Luis Arraez capped a nine-pitch at-bat with a base hit. After Josh Donaldson struck out, Mejía walked Trevor Larnach on four pitches.	Nelson Cruz popped out, but then with Max Kepler at the plate, Mejía balked to move up the runners, then threw a wild pitch that scored Arraez.	The Indians tied it in the second on Hedges’ two-out, broken-bat single that scored Bradley, who led off the inning with a walk.	STRONG STARTS	Both starters pitched well and posted remarkably similar lines, with neither figuring in the decision. Mejía threw a season-high 96 pitches for Cleveland, giving up one run and four hits while walking two and striking out six over six innings.	“The first couple innings I think he was at 53 pitches after two, and you’re kind of like, oh boy,” Indians manager Terry Francona said. “But he limited the damage early and then ... he got into a little bit of a rhythm.”	For the Twins, Jose Berríos allowed one run on four hits with two walks and nine strikeouts over 6 1/3 innings.	“He looked sharp. He threw strikes," Baldelli said. “He found ways to get through some of these innings a little bit more quickly as the game went on and became a little more efficient. He gave us a very nice effort.”	HOMECOMING	Eddie Rosario made his big league debut with the Twins in 2015, hitting a home run at Target Field in his first career at-bat. He was a regular starter and a fan favorite for the next six years. Following the 2020 season, the Twins decided it was time to give young outfielders such as Larnach and Alex Kiriloff a shot, so they didn't offer Rosario a contract.	For his part, Rosario indicated there were no hard feelings about his time in Minnesota coming to an end, and he enjoyed his return to Minneapolis.	“Before we started the game I was really excited. I know I’ve had many good moments here in Target Field,” he said. “But my focus right now is to play my game and help my team to win games. Not thinking too much for the other side. I want to have fun in Cleveland.”	After his big hit in the eighth, Rosario did flip his bat and took a quick look into the Twins dugout. But he insisted that was nothing personal.	“That’s in the moment,” he said. “I did that a lot before for the Twins. I do that when I’m doing a good job in the moment. I play excited.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Indians: Francona said RHP Aaron Civale (finger) would be shut down for 10 to 14 days before he begins a throwing program. The AL wins leader is expected to miss at least a month after being placed on the injured list Thursday. … OF Franmil Reyes (abdominal strain) and C Roberto Perez (finger) began rehab assignments at Triple-A Columbus on Wednesday. … Hedges returned from concussion protocol and was in the starting lineup.	Twins: RHP Randy Dobnak was placed on the 10-day IL with a strained middle finger on his pitching hand. … Baldelli said CF Byron Buxton is not expected to need surgery on his broken left hand.	UP NEXT	The Indians will send RHP Cal Quantrill (0-2, 2.74 ERA) to the mound to face the Twins on Friday night. Dobnak had been slated to start for Minnesota; he'll be replaced by lefty Danny Coulombe, who will be recalled from Triple-A St. Paul to make the start.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

ST. LOUIS -- — Bryan Reynolds had a three-run homer among his three hits, Chad Kuhl pitched six strong innings and the Pittsburgh Pirates snapped a nine-game losing streak against the St. Louis Cardinals with an 8-2 victory Thursday night.	Adam Frazier and Phillip Evans also homered for Pittsburgh in its first win over St. Louis since Sept. 18, 2020.	Kuhl (2-4) allowed one run and three hits with two strikeouts and three walks in six innings to improve to 2/3 in 10 career starts against the Cardinals.	“He is more in control," Pirates manager Derek Shelton said of Kuhl. “He's staying more focused. I think at times before when we saw him throw a bad pitch, it affected two or three pitches. Now if he throws a pitch where he doesn't want to, he comes back and executes the next pitch."	St. Louis has lost four in a row and 15 of its last 20 since June 2.	“I don't think we've necessarily done the greatest job of kind of making a game plan for how guys are going to throw us day by day and working on things pregame that are specifically tailored to prepare ourselves for that," Cardinals second baseman Tommy Edman said.	Carlos Martínez (3-9) allowed five runs and five hits with seven walks, including one intentional, in five innings. He is 0-5 with a 13.73 ERA and 17 walks over 19 2/3 innings in five starts in June.	Reynolds’ 13th home run of the season gave the Pirates a 5-1 lead. Reynolds has hit safely in nine straight games, going 17 for 36 (.486) in that span.	“I think it just comes back to my timing and getting my barrel ready to fire, not having it wrapped so far around my head,” Reynolds said. "I really think that’s it, just that will allow my barrel to get to the ball more consistently.”	Frazier homered off Wade LeBlanc to give the Pirates a 6-1 lead in the sixth inning.	Evans’ eighth-inning blast off LeBlanc was his fifth home run of the season and first career pinch-hit homer.	The first three Pirates reached base to start the game as Frazier walked, Ke’Bryan Hayes singled and Reynolds drove in Frazier with an RBI single.	“They’ve really done a nice job," Shelton said about the top of his lineup. “We didn’t have those guys for a long stretch of time and when we have it, they put up really consistent at-bats.”	Lars Nootbaar lined a single to center field in his first Busch Stadium at-bat to score Tyler O’Neill, cutting the St. Louis deficit to 2-1. Nootbaar made his major league debut Tuesday night in Detroit.	ON-BASE MACHINE	Hayes has reached base in 28 straight games dating to Sept. 19, 2020, including all 20 games he has played in this season. It’s the longest active streak in the majors, and the longest for a Pirates rookie since Arky Vaughan reached base in 33 straight games in 1932.	LINEUP SHUFFLE	Edman batted sixth in the lineup after leading off in his previous 71 starts. Rookie Dylan Carlson went 2 for 4 in his third start in the leadoff spot this season.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Pirates: RHP Luis Oviedo (left quad strain) worked out on the field before the game in St. Louis.	Cardinals: OF Harrison Bader (fractured rib) is playing in games at extended spring training in Jupiter, Florida.	UP NEXT	Pirates RHP Wil Crowe (0-4, 4.62 ERA) is looking for his first career win. He is 0-6 in 13 appearances, including 12 starts, since debuting with Washington last season. LHP Kwang Hyun Kim (1-5, 3.60 ERA) will start for St. Louis. He hasn't won since April 23 against Cincinnati. He's 0-5 in his last nine starts.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

LOS ANGELES -- — After Craig Kimbrel struck out pinch-hitter Will Smith to end the game, the Chicago Cubs’ closer was curious why catcher Willson Contreras celebrated with a bigger-than-usual fist pump.	Fellow reliever Ryan Tepera then ran onto the field at Dodger Stadium and whispered in Kimbrel’s ear: “You have no idea what happened.”	The Cubs’ fearsome bullpen had just teamed up with starter Zach Davies for the first combined no-hitter in franchise history — and none of the three relievers who followed Davies onto the mound had any idea they were pitching their way into history until after they finished.	The four Cubs combined for the seventh no-hitter in the majors this year, matching the most in a season since 1900, as Chicago blanked the Los Angeles Dodgers 4-0 Thursday night. The Dodgers drew eight walks, getting at least one from each opposing pitcher, but managed no other baserunners.	The tension was palpable in the Cubs' dugout, where Davies watched with trepidation after reluctantly agreeing with manager David Ross' decision to pull him for a pinch-hitter after 94 pitches. Davies (5-4) issued five walks while scrapping through six spotless innings against the defending World Series champions.	“I think every pitcher wants to continue in the game, regardless of his pitch count, but it worked,” Davies said. “Chafe, Tep and Craig shut the door. A part of history. I’m excited for the guys that were on the field. I can’t complain at all.”	But incredibly, the relievers remained blissfully oblivious to the stakes as Tepera, Andrew Chafin and Kimbrel went to the mound and preserved a zero they couldn't see, thanks to the position of the Dodger Stadium bullpen.	“The whole bullpen had no idea," said Chafin, who pitched the eighth. "It was completely oblivious. But in our defense, in that bullpen, from our perspective on the field, all we can see is batting averages and the count, stuff like that. We can’t see the scoreboard with the hits.”	Tepera and Chafin each walked a batter during their inning on the mound, but Los Angeles couldn’t capitalize.	Kimbrel then walked Chris Taylor leading off the ninth, but the ferocious closer struck out Cody Bellinger, Albert Pujols and Smith to finish the Cubs’ 17th no-hitter since 1880.	“I think they all needed to get a walk in, just to make my heart rate go up a little bit,” Ross said. “You get to the ninth, I don’t know I’ve been as nervous in a long time with a 4-0 lead and Craig Kimbrel on the mound as I was tonight.”	Javier Báez homered in the first inning and Contreras added a two-run shot in the sixth for the Cubs, who happily celebrated the franchise’s first no-hitter since last Sept. 13, when Alec Mills blanked Milwaukee.	Contreras was the constant in the combined no-no, and all four pitchers praised his work behind the plate.	“From catching this team since 2016, I’ve been catching a lot of shutout games, but nothing close to a no-hitter,” said Contreras, who was visibly emotional afterward. “Tonight was one of those nights that are super special in my life, one that will be hard to forget.	"I didn’t realize that we had a no-hitter going on until the sixth, and from the seventh on, my heart would just race and race. I was trying to slow the game down, to put the right finger down, to call the right pitch.”	The seventh no-hitter of this highly unusual season — the most in baseball history before July 1 — was the first since May 19. The Boston Red Sox also took a bid for a combined no-hitter into the eighth inning earlier Thursday, but lost the no-no and the game at Tampa Bay.	“This is an awesome moment,” Davies said. “The World Series, I think something like that probably tops it. But even though it wasn’t solo and it was a combined effort, being a part of history is something special.”	With this no-hitter — the 312th in baseball history — 2021 matches 1990, 1991, 2012 and 2015 for the most in a single MLB season since 1900. That’s one shy of the record eight in 1884, the first season overhand pitching was allowed.	The other no-hitters this year were thrown by San Diego’s Joe Musgrove (April 9), Carlos Rodón of the Chicago White Sox (April 14), Baltimore’s John Means (May 5), Cincinnati’s Wade Miley (May 7), Detroit’s Spencer Turnbull (May 18) and the New York Yankees’ Corey Kluber (May 19).	In addition, Arizona’s Madison Bumgarner pitched a seven-inning hitless game in a doubleheader on April 25 that is not recognized as a no-hitter by Major League Baseball.	The Cubs actually did something that’s been much harder than throwing a no-hitter over the past two seasons: They beat Walker Buehler, who hadn’t lost in 23 straight regular-season starts.	Buehler (7-1) took his first loss since Sept. 21, 2019, for the Dodgers despite throwing six innings of five-hit ball. Buehler made it through six innings for the 17th straight start, but lost his streak of 30 straight games overall without a defeat.	“Two really bad pitches to two really good hitters, and they took advantage of them,” Buehler said. “Just can't leave fastballs in the middle like that.”	The Dodgers hadn’t been no-hit since Aug. 30, 2015, when they were blanked in Chavez Ravine by the Cubs’ Jake Arrieta — who is scheduled to pitch for Chicago on Friday night. It was the Dodgers' 20th no-hit loss, the most in major league history.	“When something like this happens, you want it to sting a little bit,” manager Dave Roberts said. “It stings me.”	Davies bounced back sharply after yielding a career-high eight runs in his last start against Miami. Those eight runs matched the number he had allowed in his previous six starts combined, and he regained his excellent form at Dodger Stadium.	Davies walked two batters in the first before getting Pujols to ground out. He walked the leadoff batter in the third and fourth, but avoided any other trouble. The fifth inning was his first 1-2-3 frame.	The Dodgers probably got closest to a hit in the first inning when Taylor’s line drive to center was caught by Rafael Ortega.	Davies has never thrown a complete game in his seven-year major league career, which began with five seasons in Milwaukee before a stop in San Diego last year.	Tepera, Chicago’s busiest reliever, walked Gavin Lux with two outs in the seventh, but Austin Barnes lined out to second.	Chafin walked Mookie Betts with one out, but Max Muncy hit a grounder right to first baseman Anthony Rizzo, who stepped on the bag and threw to second for an easy double play.	The previous combined no-hitter in the majors was Aug. 3, 2019, when Aaron Sanchez and three Houston relievers blanked Seattle 9-0.	Buehler took a no-hitter into the eighth inning last Saturday in Arizona, where he tied the Dodgers record for consecutive regular-season starts without a loss. He made it through six innings Thursday for the 15th time this season, but he still has never beaten the Cubs.	Báez followed his 17th homer by cupping his hand to his ear as he returned to the Chicago dugout, getting a loud chorus of jeers along with cheers from the Cubs’ sizable fan contingent in Los Angeles. Buehler recovered and stayed out of trouble until the sixth, when Contreras took him deep.	Chicago added another run in the seventh when Jason Heyward singled and scored on a single by pinch-hitter Jake Marisnick, who was hitting for Davies.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Cubs: 2B Nico Hoerner (left hamstring strain) faced live pitching in the bullpen. ... LHP Justin Steele (right hamstring strain) threw a bullpen. He’s headed to Triple-A Iowa for a rehab assignment after five weeks out.	Dodgers: Betts returned from a bout of stomach flu and drew two walks. ... Justin Turner got a scheduled day off.	UP NEXT	Tony Gonsolin (0-0, 3.00 ERA) hasn’t won since returning to the rotation, but the Dodgers are 3-0 in his starts. He’ll face Arrieta (5-8, 5.45), who is 0-4 with an 8.20 ERA in his last five starts for Chicago.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

MILWAUKEE -- — Willy Adames hit a tying, two-run homer in the ninth inning and singled to set up Keston Hiura’s sacrifice fly in the 11th as the Milwaukee Brewers beat the Colorado Rockies 5-4 Friday to cap a return to full capacity at American Family Field.	Billed as Re-Opening Day, the game that originally was scheduled to be played at night drew a crowd of 31,140. It was the first time the Brewers were allowed 100% capacity at a park that holds 41,700 — Milwaukee began the season at 25 percent and upped it to 50 percent on May 15.	“Willy’s had a lot of big moments already,” Brewers manager Craig Counsell said of the shortstop, acquired from Tampa Bay on May 21 with reliever Trevor Richards. “It’s been six weeks probably and I lose track of all the big moments he’s had already.”	With Manny Piña at second base to start the bottom of the 11th, Adames singled off Lucas Gilbreath (0-1) for his third hit of the game. Piña took a turn at third, but then changed his mind as right fielder Charlie Blackmon fired back to the infield.	Jackie Bradley Jr. walked to load the bases and bring out manager Bud Black for a pitching change. Yency Almonte took over to face Hiura, who started the game batting .127.	Hiura lifted a flyball over a five-man infield that was caught by Raimel Tapia, whose one-hop throw was up the first-base line. Pina slid home headfirst to score, then ran to join his teammates mobbing Hiura.	“I thought it was great baserunning by Manny,” Counsell said. “That’s probably the fastest I’ve ever seen him run. I told him he’s discovered he’s got a new gear today.”	Hiura hit a solo homer off Colorado reliever Tyler Kinley in the seventh.	Devin Williams (4-1) pitched the 11th got the win.	Reliever Daniel Bard failed to protect a 4-2 lead as the Brewers tied it in the bottom of the ninth. Bard walked Omar Narváez and Adames followed with a drive into the Brewers’ bullpen.	“Missed location," Rockies manager Bud Black said of the home runs. “I would assume they were pretty much down the middle and sort of belt- or thigh-high.”	The Rockies fell to 6-29 on the road; they're 25-16 at Coors Field.	The Rockies took a 4-1 lead in the seventh on pinch-hitter Joshua Fuentes' two-run homer.	Kolten Wong hit a home run off Carlos Estévez in the Milwaukee eighth.	Rockies starter Jon Gray, reinstated off the injured list before the game after recovering from a right flexor strain, struck out a season-high 10 and scattered five hits over five solid innings.	“(His) fastball was hot, big, big velocity, just getting on hitters, for sure,” Counsell said of Gray’s effort. “I was glad when he left the game.”	Black echoed that praise.	“Jon was outstanding,” Black said. “He came out of it fine.”	Tapia's single with one out in the sixth was Colorado's first hit off Corbin Burnes. Tapia stole second and scored on Yonathan Daza’s hit.	Burnes allowed one run on three hits in six innings. He struck out seven and walked two.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Rockies: INF Connor Joe was optioned to Triple-A Albuquerque to clear a roster opening for Gray.	Brewers: Counsell said that 1B Daniel Vogelbach (strained left hamstring) is probably out for six weeks and LHP Brett Anderson (right knee contusion) is sidelined for up to 14 days.	COUNSELL ON THE RE-OPENER	“In the great environment that lots of people create is why we love it,” Counsell said of returning to full capacity. “It’s why fans go to it. It’s about the atmosphere that’s created. It’s about the environment that’s created We’re going to get that today.”	UP NEXT	Rockies: RHP Antonio Senzatela (2-7, 4.83 ERA) took a no-decision after allowing three earned runs in six innings in his previous start against the Brewers on June 19.	Brewers: RHP Adrian Houser (4-4, 3.95 ERA) faces Senzatela and the Rockies again. He got a no-decision after giving up five runs on nine hits through six innings in Milwaukee’s 6-5 win June 19.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

NEW YORK -- — Aaron Nola was one strike from standing alone in pitching history.	He settled for a tie with Tom Seaver — which would have felt much better if Philadelphia's beleaguered bullpen didn't blow another lead.	Nola struck out 10 straight batters to match Seaver's major league record set 51 years ago, but the New York Mets rallied past the Phillies 2-1 in eight innings Friday on big hits by Francisco Lindor and Dominic Smith during the first game of a doubleheader.	“Pretty cool being in a category with Tom,” Nola said. “It's a cool accomplishment, but winning's cooler in my opinion.”	New York took advantage of an embarrassing two-base error by reliever José Alvarado, who overthrew first base on a comebacker while clinging to a 1-0 lead in the seventh inning of a game scheduled for seven under pandemic rules.	First baseman Rhys Hoskins, with sunglasses perched uselessly atop the bill of his cap, appeared to have trouble seeing the ball in the evening glare and ducked a bit as the throw sailed just over his mitt.	That led to Lindor's tying single with two outs, and Smith — after squaring to bunt on a previous pitch — won it with an RBI single off Ranger Suárez (3-2) in the eighth.	“We just had a tough game against a very tough pitcher and the guys didn’t give up,” New York manager Luis Rojas said.	Seaver fanned his final 10 hitters for the Mets in a 2-1 victory over the San Diego Padres at Shea Stadium on April 22, 1970.	The Hall of Famer's mark for consecutive strikeouts remained unmatched for more than five decades until Nola whiffed Michael Conforto with a changeup leading off the fourth at Citi Field, which replaced Shea Stadium as the Mets’ home in 2009 on an adjacent site in Queens.	“I guess I wasn’t really thinking about anything except getting him out,” Nola said, adding he'll probably get the souvenir ball authenticated and put it in a little box at home.	Nola also singled off the left-field wall and doubled home Philadelphia's run against starter Taijuan Walker during a sensational all-around performance that resembled a Little League star.	“I got no pop,” a grinning Nola said with a chuckle. “I thought I got my first one.”	The right-hander equaled a career high with 12 strikeouts in 5 1/3 innings of two-hit ball, but a struggling bullpen was unable to hang on as the Phillies dropped their fourth in a row.	Seth Lugo (1-0) struck out three in the top of the eighth and stranded two runners for the NL East leaders, playing their third doubleheader in seven days.	“Every loss is tough right now, especially (to) these guys,” Nola said. “They’re in first place and this is a big series for us.”	Featuring a nasty knuckle curve, Nola started and ended his streak with punchouts of Conforto. With the crowd chanting his name, Pete Alonso halted the astounding run of Ks when he reached across the plate to poke a 1-2 slider inside the right-field line for a line-drive double.	Nola actually got off to an inauspicious start. He hit leadoff batter Jeff McNeil with a curveball in the first inning and then gave up a double to Lindor that left runners at second and third.	The right-hander struck out Conforto, Alonso and Smith in succession to keep New York off the scoreboard, and didn’t slow down. James McCann, Kevin Pillar and Luis Guillorme went down in the second, then Walker, McNeil and Lindor in the third — all wearing a patch with Seaver’s uniform No. 41 on their sleeves.	“They knew there was a string of strikeouts going on, and they knew how good he was because they kept talking about it,” Rojas said. “We've seen him lights out and this is, when he's lights out, that's how he is.”	Seven of the strikeouts during Nola’s string were swinging. He caught Smith, McCann and Walker looking.	The streak alone gave Nola his 19th double-digit strikeout game and third this season.	BACK IN THE BIGS	Philadelphia called up reliever Neftalí Feliz, who hasn't pitched in the majors since August 2017 with Kansas City. Before this season, he hadn't even appeared in affiliated ball since 2018. The 2010 AL Rookie of the Year was added to the 40-man roster when his contract was selected from Triple-A Lehigh Valley.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Phillies: RHP Sam Coonrod was placed on the 10-day injured list, retroactive to Thursday, with right forearm tendinitis.	Mets: Marcus Stroman threw a bullpen and felt “really good,” Rojas said. ”Everything was on point." The right-hander plans to take his next scheduled turn in the rotation Sunday or Monday. He left Tuesday’s outing early with a sore hip. ... Between games, 3B Jonathan Villar (calf) was placed on the 10-day IL, retroactive to Tuesday, with a strained right calf. INF Travis Blankenhorn was recalled from Syracuse and was active for the second game. ... OF Brandon Nimmo (left index finger) is expected back next week, Rojas said.	UP NEXT	Phillies LHP Matt Moore (0-1, 7.36 ERA) started the nightcap against LHP David Peterson (2-5, 5.31). Moore came off the 10-day injured list Wednesday. He had been sidelined since May 21 with lower back spasms, and hadn't started in the majors since April 17.	Mets ace Jacob deGrom (7-2, 0.50) is scheduled to pitch Saturday against Zach Eflin (2-6, 4.39).	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

BUFFALO, N.Y. -- — Austin Hays drove in two runs to cap an eighth-inning rally, and the Baltimore Orioles beat the Toronto Blue Jays 6-5 in 10 innings Friday night to stop a 20-game road losing streak.	Baltimore’s road skid was tied for the second-longest in AL history, trailing only the 22 losses in a row by the 1943 Philadelphia Athletics. The last-place Orioles won for the second time in 16 games and improved to 24-52, including 12-26 away from home.	“We’re partying like we won a wild-card game here right now,” Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said over music blaring in the visiting clubhouse. “And rightfully so. We haven’t had much to celebrate here lately.”	Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit his major league-leading 25th home run for Toronto.	Paul Fry (1-2) retired the side in the ninth inning, and Cole Sulser pitched a scoreless 10th for his second save.	The Orioles took their first lead in the 10th inning after Toronto’s Trent Thornton (1-3) walked three batters and forced in Trey Mancini, who started the inning as the automatic runner under pandemic rules.	Marcus Semien hit a two-run double for the Blue Jays, who had won five straight.	Baltimore tied the game in the eighth inning by scored four runs — one more than the Orioles produced over the past four losses. Ryan Mountcastle and pinch-hitter Anthony Santander each drove in runners who were walked by reliever Tyler Chatwood before scoring on Hays’ double off Tayler Saucedo.	“The bullpen didn’t do their job.” Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said. “When you walk that many people in the eighth and (10th) inning, you’re probably not going to win those games.”	Orioles center fielder Cedric Mullins said the dugout was “electric” during the tying rally.	“It was a great team win, great comeback,” said Mullins, who contributed two hits, a walk and a run. “It’s important for us to try to keep our morale up during times like this. We know we have a talented group of guys. It’s just a matter of putting it together. We were able to do a little bit of everything today and come out with a win.”	The Blue Jays’ bullpen squandered a solid outing from rookie starter Alek Manoah, who pitched while appealing a five-game suspension for hitting the Orioles’ Maikel Franco with a pitch last weekend. Manoah allowed four hits, two walks and an unearned run while striking out six batters in six innings.	“It’s an emotional deal when he’s facing the same team that he had problems a week ago,” said Montoyo, who served a one-game suspension following Manoah’s ejection. “He did a great job. He passed the test.”	Guerrero energized the crowd on his bobblehead night and put the Blue Jays ahead with his home run in the third inning. He lined a first-pitch fastball to center field to move one ahead of the Los Angeles Angels’ Shohei Ohtani, who homered earlier Friday.	Randal Grichuk made it 3-1 when he tripled off the right-field wall and scored on a two-out infield single by Lourdes Gurriel Jr., who had three hits.	George Springer gave the Blue Jays an early lead when he homered on a slider in the second inning. Springer’s third homer was his first hit in three games since returning from the injured list.	The Orioles snapped a scoreless streak spanning 26 2/3 innings with a tying run in the third.	Matt Harvey gave up three runs and six hits in 5 2/3 innings and is 0-8 in his last 10 starts. Harvey returned to the Buffalo ballpark where he was a Triple-A All-Star in 2012 while in the Mets farm system.	“Winning Major League games are a lot of fun,” Harvey said. “Especially where we’ve been at on the road the last couple months. It’s been frustrating. So we’ll definitely remember what winning is like again and get back out there and try to keep the streak going.”	BOBBLE-VLAD	Guerrero bobblehead dolls with a home run counter were give to the first 7,000 fans, leading to longer-than-usual lines outside the gates in Buffalo.	Announced attendance was a season-high 7,844, up from 6,264 for Thursday night’s game.	ROSTER CHANGES	Baltimore recalled LHP Alexander Wells from Triple-A Norfolk on Friday and selected the contract of RHP Konner Wade. In corresponding moves, RHP Mickey Jannis was designated for assignment and RHP Dean Kremer was optioned to Norfolk. Kremer will have an extended stay in the minors, Hyde said, following a rough start Thursday in the Blue Jays’ 9-0 win. The 25-year-old rookie gave up six runs, two hits and five walks while getting just one out, raising his season ERA to 7.25. The Australian-born Wells, 24, was available out of the bullpen Friday and could take Kremer’s spot in the starting rotation Tuesday in Houston.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Blue Jays: LHP Ryan Borucki (forearm) threw a bullpen session Friday for the first time since going in the injured list May 14. … Montoyo said he preferred to avoid using RHP Joel Payamps (back), but he was prepared to pitch the 11th inning if needed.	UP NEXT	The Orioles will try to start a road winning streak Saturday when LHP Keegan Akin (0-3, 6.42 ERA) pitches against Blue Jays’ LHP Hyun Jin Ryu (6-4, 3.25 ERA).	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- — Shohei Ohtani led off by homering for the seventh time in nine games, a long drive off an overhanging catwalk, but the Tampa Bay Rays edged the Los Angeles Angels 4-3 Friday night when pinch-hitter Brandon Lowe was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded.	Moved up to the leadoff spot, Ohtani hit a drive estimated at 453 feet off the D-ring in right field at Tropicana Field, only the 39th ball to reach that spot since the park opened in 1998.	“I've never seen that in a game or batting practice,” said Angels manager Joe Maddon, who managed the Rays from 2006-14.	It was Ohtani's 24th homer, extending a career high. He began the night one behind Vladimir Guerrero Jr. for the major league lead. Guerrero also homered in his game against Baltimore.	“We know what a talent Ohtani is,” Rays manager Kevin Cash said. “He showed us multiple ways today."	Ohtani had a bunt single in the third and finished 2 for 4.	Ohtani is the first player to hit a leadoff homer and get a win as a pitcher in the same season since Jimmy Ryan of the Chicago Cubs and Baltimore's Kid Madden in 1891, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.	“He's a freak,” said Rays pitcher Shane McClanahan, who will start Saturday's game. “How do you throw a 100 and hit 450-foot home runs? He's a one-of-a-kind player.”	Lowe was hit by Steve Cishek's pitch with the score 3-all in the seventh inning. Yandy Díaz and Ji-Man Choi walked to start the inning against José Suarez (2-1).	After Wander Franco flied out, Austin Meadows' pop to shallow left dropped between three defenders and loaded the bases. The umpires opted not to call an infield fly on the play, and Los Maddon came on the field and had a discussion with plate umpire Bill Miller.	Cishek entered and hit Lowe.	Collin McHugh (2-1) went 1 1/3 scoreless innings to get the win. Diego Castillo worked the ninth for his 12th save.	The victory was Cash’s 500th as manager of the Rays (500-447) . It came against Maddon, who is the winningest manager in Tampa Bay franchise history at 754-705.	“It’s special,” Cash said. “This is a special job to have. I’m so appreciative of the people I get to work with, and certainly the players. You get these wins because of the talent you have.”	Anthony Rendon also homered in the first off Andrew Kittredge for the Angels, who have lost four straight.	The Rays have won three straight games after a season-high seven-game losing streak.	Meadows had a two-run single during a three-run first against Griffin Canning as the Rays took a 3-2 lead. The first run scored when left fielder Taylor Ward was charged with an error after dropping Franco’s line drive.	Los Angeles tied it at 3 in the third when David Fletcher doubled off Josh Fleming and later scored when catcher Francisco Mejía dropped a throw from first baseman Choi on Jared Walsh’s grounder.	Franco, who homered and doubled in his major league debut on Tuesday, went 0 for 4 and is hitless in his last 12 at-bats.	TROUT TALES	CF Mike Trout (right calf strain) is still not expected back until after the All-Star Game next month but is improving.	“It’s definitely happening, trending in the right direction,” Maddon said. “He’s going to get to the point very soon of getting more active physically regarding testing things. Everything is going well, so we’re all excited about that.”	WELCOME BACK	Maddon, who led the Rays to the 2008 AL pennant, is managing his second series as an opposing skipper at Tropicana Field.	He had an eventful pregame, getting inducted into the Sports Club of Tampa Bay Hall of Fame at a luncheon and then having his 1959 El Camino break down in the ballpark parking lot due to a broken cable.	Maddon was disappointed because the car had been running so well.	“I love driving it when I get here,” Maddon said. “It’s a great vehicle.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Angels: OF Justin Upton (right low back strain) went on the 10-day IL.	Rays: RHP Chris Archer (right forearm) could face hitters for the first time since mid-April early next week.	UP NEXT	Angels RHP Alex Cobb (5-2) will go against McClanahan (2-2) Saturday. Cobb went 48-35 for the Rays from 2011-17.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

CINCINNATI -- — Guillermo Heredia homered, doubled and made a defensive gem before crashing into the wall in the eighth inning in his return to Atlanta's lineup, helping the Braves beat the Cincinnati Reds 3-2 on Friday night.	Heredia returned to the lineup after being available off the bench the last two games due to right wrist inflammation.	“You never want to miss time,” Heredia said, via translator Franco Garcia. “Thankfully I was able to recover and help the team out.”	The game's first run came in the fifth when Atlanta's Freddie Freeman doubled home Ronald Acuña Jr. for his 900th career RBI.	Acuña returned to the lineup after missing two games with lower back tightness.	Dansby Swanson hit a solo homer in the sixth and Heredia added a solo shot in the seventh, both off Reds rookie Vladimir Gutiérrez (3-2).	“He was gassed up, I guess,” Braves manager Brian Snitker said of Heredia. “He was fresh. That was a really good ballgame for him.”	Gutiérrez got some defensive help in the fourth. With runners on second and third and two outs, Eugenio Suárez made a diving stop of William Contreras’ bouncer down the line and threw to first from his knees to end the inning.	“There were several (good defensive) plays tonight,” Reds manager David Bell said.	Suárez also hit a solo home run off Luke Jackson in the seventh.	Drew Smyly (1-1) exited after six innings with a 3-1 lead, and the bullpen held on. Smyly has won his last three decisions.	“The breaking ball's been good, the fastball, too,” Snitker said. “Hopefully, he stays on this roll for another three months. He's been really, really good.”	Will Smith worked the ninth and picked up his 16th save.	Heredia robbed Jesse Winker of an extra-base hit leading off the eighth and collided with the wall. He stayed down on the warning track but remained in the game after being attended to by training staff.	“It was just a reaction,” Heredia said. “I just took off running and was able to track it down. My stomach hit (the wall) and knocked the air out of me. I felt like a boxer.”	Snitker jogged from the dugout to deep center field to check on Heredia. Once he knew Heredia was fine, the Braves' skipper joked he might need some help getting back to the dugout.	“I told him I needed a couple of minutes to before I made the trek back,” Snitker said. “Told them I might need an Uber.”	FOR STARTERS	The Braves starters have been on a roll of late, with Smyly delivering another strong outing on Friday. Saturday's starter, Ian Anderson, tossed 5 1/3 shutout innings in his last start. Charlie Morton hasn't allowed a run in 14 2/3 innings over his last two starts. “Everyone expects the next guy to dominate,” Smyly said. “It's a matter of all of us clicking at the same time.”	ROTATION MATTERS	Snitker has not named a starter for Sunday’s series finale in Cincinnati, but he did confirm that Charlie Morton will start Tuesday against the Mets, and Max Fried who's currently on the injured list with a blister, is expected to take the mound on Wednesday. Morton will be pitching on an extra two day's rest.	TRAINERS ROOM	Reds: After being scratched from his minor-league rehab start on Thursday due to a stiff back, right-hander Sonny Gray is confident he can make his scheduled start on Saturday, keeping him on track to rejoin the Reds rotation next week. Outfielder Nick Senzel (left knee) and infielder Mike Moustakas (right heel) aren't expected back until after the All-Star break.	UP NEXT	After posting a 7.22 ERA in his first 11 starts. Reds right-hander Luis Castillo (2-10, 5.61 ERA) has a 2.19 ERA in four starts since. He'll be opposed by right-hander Ian Anderson (5-3, 3.33 ERA) who is making his first career start against the Reds.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

BOSTON -- — The Yankees bats have been some of hottest in the majors lately. They ran into a Red Sox bullpen that find ways to quiet them down.	Hunter Renfroe had two RBI, including go-ahead sacrifice fly in the third inning, and Boston’s pitchers held New York scoreless over the final seven innings to help post a 5-3 win on Friday night.	It was Boston’s fourth straight win over its rival, a streak that started with a three-game sweep in New York earlier in the month. Boston opened this three-game series in second place in the AL East, 3 1/2 games ahead of third-place New York.	The announced attendance of 36,869 on a night the Red Sox honored retired second baseman Dustin Pedroia was the first sellout of the season since Fenway went back to full capacity on May 29 for the first time since the start of the pandemic.	“The fact that we ended it with a. 6-4-3 double play, that was meant to be,” Red Sox manager Alex Cora said.	New York reliever Zack Britton came out of the game in the eighth inning with a left hamstring injury. Manager Aaron Boone said he expects to have more of a prognosis on Saturday.	Boston starter Martín Pérez allowed six hits and three runs over 3 2/3 innings, walking two and striking out three before being replaced by Hirokazu Sawamura.	Sawamura pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings, turning it over to Garrett Whitlock (3-1) in the sixth, who got the win after allowing no runs and one hit over two innings. Adam Ottavino pitched a scoreless eighth, handing it over to Matt Barnes.	Barnes allowed two hits in in the ninth but struck out Clint Frazier and got DJ LeMahieu to hit into a game-ending double play to pick up his 16th save in 19 chances.	“It’s not just one player winning the game. I think it’s everybody putting everything together to win it. That’s what we did tonight,” Pérez said.	Yankees sluggers Aaron Judge, Gary Sánchez and Giancarlo Stanton combined to go 1 for 10. LeMahieu is 15 for 28 (.536) with 34 RBI for the Yankees with the bases loaded.	New York’s Domingo Germán (4-5) pitched four innings, yielding five hits and all four runs while striking out three and walking one to take the loss.	“He missed some spots with his fastball again,” Boone said. “Obviously, a little bit of a tough start there for him.”	Boston’s bats got going early.	Bogaerts put the Red Sox up 2-0 in the first with a two-run double to center field. He then scored off Hunter Renfroe’s double to left field.	The Yankees got all the runs all back in the second, courtesy of some shaky defense by Boston. Giancarlo Stanton led off with a walk, followed by Luke Voit’s single. With one out Gia Urshela reached on an error by Bogaerts, loading the bases.	Miguel Andújar struck out, but Pérez walked Clint Frazier to put the Yankees on the scoreboard. DJ LeMahieu then tied the game up with a two-run single.	K CORNER	RHP Esteban Loaisiga became the third Yankees pitcher to strike out four in an inning when he did it in the seventh, joining A.J. Burnett in the sixth inning against Colorado on June 24, 2011, and Phil Hughes against Toronto in the fourth inning on Sept. 20, 2012. Michael Chavis reached on a wild pitch as he struck out, and Alex Verdugo, J.D. Martinez and Xander Bogaerts fanned in order.	HE’S OUT	Urshela narrowly avoided being tagged out as he slid into second on his leadoff double in the fourth inning.	He wasn’t as lucky just a pitch later when Miguel Andújar sent a sharp single to right field and Urshela was easily thrown out at home plate by Renfroe.	It was Renfroe’s 11th outfield assist, which leads the majors. It marked the 15th time the Yankees have made an out at home this season and 33rd time a runner has gotten an out on the bases overall. Both are tops in the majors.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Yankees: Britton came out with one out in the eighth after throwing a pitch in the dirt to Renfroe. He was replaced by Luis Cessa. … Boone said RHP Corey Kluber (right shoulder strain) is throwing at 75 feet but isn’t yet ready to stretch beyond that. … Boone said RHP Luis Severino, who return from Tommy John surgery was interrupted by a strained right hamstring, has been running and throwing. He could possibly be throwing off a mound in the next 5-10 days.	Red Sox: LHP Chris Sale (Tommy John surgery) is scheduled to face hitters during live batting practice Saturday, Cora said. Sale will throw 20 pitches. He’s slated for another batting practice session next week.	UP NEXT	Yankees: Left-hander Jordan Montgomery (3-1, 4.03 ERA) is set to make his 15th start of the season. New York is 11-3 in his previous 14 starts.	Red Sox: Right-hander Nathan Eovaldi (7-4, 3.90) leads Boston in wins and has gone five or more innings in 13 of his last 15 starts.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MIAMI -- —	Kyle Schwarber hit 13th home run in the last 14 games but Miguel Rojas hit a three-run homer in a four-run first inning and the Miami Marlins went on to beat the Washington Nationals 11-2 Friday night.	Schwarber has the second-most homers in a 14-game span since at least 1901, behind only 14 by San Francisco’s Barry Bonds in 2001.	Schwarber hit his 22nd home run this season into the right field upper deck in the third inning, cutting Washington’s deficit to 4-1. His 12 home runs in his last 12 games are the most from a leadoff hitter ever in that span.	Rojas had four RBI, and Garrett Cooper homered and doubled twice as the Marlins stopped a four-game losing streak. Adam Duvall reached base four times with two singles and two walks.	“You’re going to have your ups and downs,” Cooper said. “We’ve had more downs than we would have liked. Hitting is contagious. As soon as a couple of guys get a few hits, you feel more confident stepping to the plate. It’s a team thing.”	Washington had won five in a row.	Pablo López (4-4) gave up two runs and six hits in six innings with nine strikeouts and one walk. He retired his last 10 batters, striking out the side in the sixth.	After scoring five runs during their skid, the Marlins took an 8-2 lead after four innings.	“We’re seeing signs of our offense,” Miami manager Don Mattingly said. “Hopefully we get our whole lineup back together. For us to start to get in some kind of rhythm would be great for us. It would take some pressure off the pitching.”	Jon Lester (1-3) allowed seven runs, five hits and three walks in a season-low 2 1/3 innings, raising his ERA to 4.99.	“I wasn’t able to throw strikes, wasn’t able to get ahead in the count,” Lester said. “I put myself behind the eight-ball. You give big league hitters the opportunity in hitters’ counts like I was able to tonight, then stuff like that happens.”	Duvall hit an RBI single and Rojas stopped trotting to second on his homer, turned around and returned to touch first base.	Schwarber’s 13th home run in June tied Bryce Harper in March 2015 for the most for the Nationals in a month.	“The way we’re swinging our bats, if we kept it close, it would have been a different ballgame,” Washington manager Dave Martinez said. “We needed that one inning to get out of an inning but it didn’t happen.”	Cooper, activated from the injured list, hit a two-run homer off Jefry Rodríguez in the eighth.	Miami reliever Anthony Bender pitched a scoreless seventh, extending his career-starting streak without an earned run to 20 1/3 innings.	LÓPEZ OVERCOMES DIFFICULT START	After López retired Yan Gomes on a double play to end the third, he resembled the pitcher who blanked the Chicago Cubs through seven innings in his previous start.	“They made me work a lot,” López said. “I was able to make good pitches with the fastball.”	PRE-GAME MEETING SPURS MARLINS	Miami's offense revived following a players and coaches meeting before the game. After winning the first two at Wrigley Field last weekend, the Marlins lost the third game of the series and first three of their six-game homestand.	“We’re not where we want to be right now, but we have time left,” Rojas said. “We have to start showing some fight, and not just for a day or two.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Nationals: 1B Josh Bell (right side discomfort) is expected to return to the lineup Saturday. RHP Daniel Hudson (elbow inflammation) is progressing with his throwing program and could throw a bullpen early next week.	UP NEXT	LHP Patrick Corbin (5-5, 5.40) will start the third game of the series for the Nationals on Saturday while the Marlins will go with RHP Zach Thompson (1-2, 1.50).	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

NEW YORK -- — Aaron Nola went on a record-tying run of strikeouts and Bryce Harper sealed his homer with a kiss.	Long day of baseball at Citi Field, but it certainly wasn't bland.	Harper blew smooches at a booing crowd to punctuate his drive, and the Philadelphia Phillies beat the New York Mets 2-1 in eight innings Friday night for a doubleheader split after Nola matched a long-standing major league mark with 10 straight Ks in the opener.	“In today’s game, what an accomplishment,” Harper said. “I’ll always remember that one.”	Odúbel Herrera drove in the tiebreaking run with a groundout against Mets reliever Sean Reid-Foley (2-1) in the eighth as both games took an extra inning to decide.	Nola tied Tom Seaver’s record for consecutive strikeouts set 51 years ago, but New York rallied to win the first game 2-1 in eight innings on big hits by a fired-up Francisco Lindor and Dominic Smith.	“Pretty cool being in a category with Tom,” Nola said. “It’s a cool accomplishment, but winning’s cooler in my opinion.”	In the nightcap, New York loaded the bases with nobody out in the bottom of the seventh, but Archie Bradley (3-1) allowed only pinch-hitter James McCann's tying sacrifice fly.	Demoted closer Héctor Neris retired Lindor, Pete Alonso and Smith with the automatic runner in scoring position for his 11th save in 16 chances. Neris struck out Smith to end it as Philadelphia's beleaguered bullpen finally closed one out to snap a four-game slide.	Phillies left fielder Andrew McCutchen robbed Albert Almora Jr. of an early two-run homer.	“It's the difference in the game, for sure," Philadelphia manager Joe Girardi said. “Just a great play.”	Harper hit his 11th homer of the season and third in four games on an 0-2 pitch from starter David Peterson to put the Phillies ahead 1-0 in the sixth.	When he reached the dugout, Harper donned the team's oversized straw home run hat and feigned kisses to agitated Mets fans, even popping back out to wave again.	“Fired up with the boys of course, and I have a lot of fans here in Citi Field so just thought I’d say hi and let them know I’m still here,” Harper said. “It’s always fun coming in here. We always badger back and forth. I mean, we have ever since I was 19.”	In the opener, Nola was one strike from standing alone in pitching history. He settled for a tie with Seaver at 10 Ks in a row before the Phillies blew another lead.	New York took advantage of an embarrassing two-base error by reliever José Alvarado, who overthrew first base on a comebacker while clinging to a 1-0 advantage in the seventh.	First baseman Rhys Hoskins, with sunglasses perched uselessly atop the bill of his cap, had trouble seeing the ball in the evening glare and ducked a bit as the throw sailed just over his mitt.	That led to Lindor's tying single with two outs, and Smith — after squaring to bunt on a previous pitch — won it with an RBI single off Ranger Suárez (3-2) in the eighth.	“I think it was real important that we bounced back,” Girardi said. “You don’t lose too many games where a first baseman loses the ball in the sun. It’s probably a matter of 10 or 15 minutes. If it’s before or after we’re probably fine. It’s an unbelievable way to lose a game.”	Seaver fanned his final 10 hitters for the Mets in a 2-1 victory over the San Diego Padres at Shea Stadium on April 22, 1970.	The Hall of Famer's mark for consecutive strikeouts remained unmatched for more than five decades until Nola whiffed Michael Conforto with a changeup leading off the fourth at Citi Field, which replaced Shea Stadium as the Mets’ home in 2009 on an adjacent site in Queens.	“I guess I wasn’t really thinking about anything except getting him out,” Nola said, adding he'll probably get the souvenir ball authenticated and put it in a little box at home.	Nola also singled off the left-field wall and doubled home Philadelphia's run against starter Taijuan Walker during a sensational all-around performance that resembled a Little League star.	“I got no pop,” a grinning Nola said with a chuckle. “I thought I got my first one.”	The right-hander equaled a career high with 12 strikeouts in 5 1/3 innings of two-hit ball, but the Phillies couldn't hang on.	Seth Lugo (1-0) struck out three in the top of the eighth and stranded two runners for the NL East leaders, who have split three doubleheaders in seven days.	“We'll take the split, move forward,” Mets manager Luis Rojas said.	Featuring a nasty knuckle curve, Nola started and ended his streak with punchouts of Conforto. With the crowd chanting his name, Alonso halted the astounding run of strikeouts when he reached across the plate to poke a 1-2 slider inside the right-field line for a line-drive double.	Nola actually got off to an inauspicious start. He hit leadoff batter Jeff McNeil with a curveball in the first inning and then gave up a double to Lindor that left runners at second and third.	The right-hander struck out Conforto, Alonso and Smith in succession to keep New York off the scoreboard, and didn’t stop there. James McCann, Kevin Pillar and Luis Guillorme went down in the second, then Walker, McNeil and Lindor in the third — all wearing a patch with Seaver’s retired uniform No. 41 on their sleeves.	“They knew there was a string of strikeouts going on, and they knew how good he was because they kept talking about it,” Rojas said.	Seven strikeouts during Nola’s run were swinging. He caught Smith, McCann and Walker looking.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- — Nate Lowe’s three hits included his first career triple in the majors as the Texas Rangers dominated their former All-Star Mike Minor and beat the Kansas City Royals 9-4 on Friday night.	Playing his 146th game in the big leagues, Lowe’s two-run triple highlighted a four-run fourth inning.	Rookie Jonah Heim matched career highs with three hits and two RBI for Texas.	Dane Dunning (3-6) won for the first time since May 9, allowing two runs on five hits and two walks in five innings. After allowing an RBI double to Carlos Santana that cut the Rangers’ lead to 4-2, Dunning stranded runners at second and third in the fifth when center fielder Adolis Garcia ran down Salvador Perez’s long flyball in front of the Texas bullpen in right-center.	Lowe’s slicing, opposite-field triple fell just in front of left fielder Hunter Dozier and rolled to the wall. Heim’s single completed the Rangers’ scoring in the fourth and he hit an RBI double in a five-run sixth.	Lowe is hitting .423 during a seven-game hitting streak after seeing his batting average drop from .289 on May 11 to .237 on June 11.	“Just getting back to being me,” Lowe said. “I went through a rough patch there, but that’s part of growing up, being a major league player and part of figuring out what I need to do to get better.”	Minor (6-5), an All-Star for the Rangers in 2019 who traded at the deadline in 2020, allowed a career-high nine earned runs in five-plus innings in his 197th career start. His 11 hits allowed tied a career high.	The Royals have lost three straight games and 15 of their last 19.	“Even when I made the pitches, they got hits,” Minor said. “That might have been one of my worst games statistically in my career, but I don't feel like I'm going to change a whole lot.”	Royals manager Mike Matheny watched the 33-year-old Minor’s first three innings, allowing only two hits on 37 pitches, and, “I truly thought we were watching our first complete game of the season the way he was rolling.”	“We know Mike well. He was pretty good early on I felt like. Kind of got on that changeup. Got some big hits," Texas manager Chris Woodward said.	Whit Merrifield gave the Royals a 1-0 lead in the third with a two-out triple to right-center that sailed just under the glove of a diving Garcia. The triple, Kansas City’s first hit of the game, came on an eight-pitch at-bat and extended Merrifield’s hitting streak to 11 games.	DUFFY OUT OF THE PEN	Royals LHP Danny Duffy, who last Wednesday made his first start since May 12 after recovering from a strained forearm, made his second relief appearance since 2016 and retired all three batters in the seventh with one strikeout.	Matheny said he still plans to start Duffy in the Royals’ next series at Boston, looking to get significant innings but not deep pitch counts.	SHORT HOPS	It was Lowe’s second three-hit game of the season. … Rangers pitching snapped a franchise-record 19-game streak for allowing a home run. … Merrifield went 2 for 4 and is batting .375 during his hitting streak. … Dunning’s 85 pitches were four short of his season high, which came in the May 9 win, 10-2 over Seattle.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Rangers OF David Dahl (rib cage, upper back) worked out at Globe Life Field on Friday instead of playing for Double-A Frisco but remains on his minor-league rehab assignment.	UP NEXT	Royals RHP Kyle Zimmer (3-0, 2.48) will make his second start of the season, with three innings being the longest of the 26 appearances this season. Rangers RHP Kyle Gibson (5-0, 2.17) allowed five earned runs while getting only one out on opening day at Kansas City since then has a 1.63 ERA.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO -- — Pitching on a wet, humid night in Chicago, Yusei Kikuchi delivered once again.	The Japanese left-hander is good everywhere he goes these days.	Kikuchi turned in another road gem and Luis Torrens homered twice, helping the Seattle Mariners beat Carlos Rodón and the White Sox 9-3 on Friday.	Led by Kikuchi and Torrens, Seattle opened a six-game trip with its ninth win in 11 games. Jake Fraley also went deep for the Mariners, and Jake Bauers had a run-scoring single.	“It seemed like almost every inning we had guys out there on base or in scoring position,” manager Scott Servais said. “So, really like what we're doing offensively.”	Kikuchi allowed one run and two hits in 5 2/3 innings while improving to 4-0 with a 1.98 ERA over his last six starts. Kikuchi (5-3) has been one of the AL’s best road pitchers this year with a 3-1 record and a 2.89 ERA in eight such starts, but it seems as if he is enjoying success in all situations at the moment.	“I don't necessarily think that I do feel more comfortable or pitch better on the road or anything like that,” he said through a translator. “I feel like my recent outings at home have been pretty solid as well.”	Torrens hit a two-run shot in the second and another two-run drive in the seventh for his first career multihomer game. The 25-year-old Torrens is batting .429 (9 for 21) with five homers and nine RBI in six games since he was recalled from Triple-A Tacoma on June 14.	“My mindset is attack every pitch,” he said.	AL Central-leading Chicago welcomed a crowd of 32,189 for what it dubbed “Reopening Night” — its first home game without COVID-19-related attendance restrictions since the 2019 season. But Carlos Rodón (6-3) struggled with his location, and the White Sox lost for the sixth time in seven games.	Yasmani Grandal's second-inning homer accounted for Chicago's only run against Kikuchi (5-3), who struck out six and walked four.	“It was a struggle. I do think their starter pitched well, and I think their relievers threw the ball well," White Sox manager Tony La Russa said. “Didn’t make it any easier for us.”	Grandal's 12th homer trimmed Seattle's lead to 2-1, but Bauers drove in Ty France with his two-out single in the third and Fraley connected for a two-run homer in the sixth.	Rodón labored through five innings in his first loss since May 26. The lefty allowed three runs and five hits, struck out eight and walked four.	“Definitely made it tough today to put them away. They battled,” said Rodón, who pitched five scoreless innings at Seattle in his first start of the year on April 5.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: RHP Justin Dunn is going to see a specialist about the strained muscle in his right shoulder. Servais said he thinks the meeting was Friday, and the team could get an update on Dunn this weekend. ... Servais said 1B Evan White is still trying to determine a plan of action after he had a setback in his recovery from a hip flexor injury while on a rehab assignment at Triple-A Tacoma. ... CF Kyle Lewis (right knee surgery) got his stitches removed and is picking up his rehab. “Positive feedback from Kyle, but still a long ways away from picking up any baseball activity,” Servais said.	White Sox: 3B Yoán Moncada rolled his left ankle late in the game, but he stayed in. ... RHP Michael Kopech (strained left hamstring) threw 26 pitches during a simulated game. “Saw exciting progress. Arm had that life," La Russa said. Kopech is expected to throw another simulated game on Monday. He could be activated once the team thinks he is ready, or he could head to Triple-A Charlotte for a rehab stint.	UP NEXT	Mariners rookie Logan Gilbert (2-2, 4.50 ERA) and White Sox right-hander Lance Lynn (7-3, 2.14 ERA) start on Saturday. Gilbert, a 6-foot-6 right-hander, is 2-0 with a 3.12 ERA in three June starts. Lynn was tagged for six runs and eight hits in four innings during a 7-3 loss at Houston on Saturday.	------	Jay Cohen can be reached at https://twitter.com/jcohenap	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ST. LOUIS -- — Wil Crowe gave up four runs over five innings for his first major league win, and the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the St. Louis Cardinals 5-4 on Friday night for their fifth victory in seven games following a 10-game losing streak.	Jacob Stallings and Phillip Evans drove in two runs each for the Pirates.	“We had a couple of chances to blow it open, didn’t do that and even more importantly, the fact that that we had to continue to grind, we had runners on base, we had to make plays,” Pirates manager Derek Shelton said. “Yeah, that was a hard-fought win.”	St. Louis has lost five straight, seven of eight and 18 of 24, dropping a season-worst four games under .500 at 36-40. The Cardinals are fourth in the NL Central, seven games back of first-place Milwaukee.	“We’re all kind of like scuffing at the same time, and that’s tough,” Cardinals third baseman Nolan Arenado said. “Usually, you have some people keeping you afloat … right now it seems like we’re all kind of scuffling at the same time.”	Crowe (1-4), was making his 13th big league start and 14th appearance. The 26-year-old right-hander debuted last Aug. 22.	“I felt like it was a monkey on my back,” Crowe said. “The first one, to me, it’s like it was the hardest one.”	He allowed eight hits, struck out two and walked two. Crowe gave up solo homers to Arenado in the third and Dylan Carlson in the fourth.	“There’s been games that he’s thrown the ball probably better than this,” Shelton said. “The fact that he continued to grind, it was extremely humid, you know, he did a nice job.”	Clay Holmes and Chasen Shreve combined for two hitless innings, Kyle Crick gave up one hit in the eighth and Richard Rodríguez pitched a perfect ninth for his 10th save in 12 chances.	Stallings’ single off Jake Woodford (1-1) broke a 4-4 tie in the fifth.	“We made good plays tonight, got some timely hits and our bullpen came in, did what they do,” Stallings said.	Starter Kwang Hyun Kim needed 70 pitches to get through 4 1/3 innings. He allowed at least one runner in each of his four full innings and gave up four runs and seven hits.	Crowe hit Kim in the chest in the second inning while Kim was attempting to bunt, which loaded the bases with one out, setting up Carlson’s RBI grounder.	Pittsburgh went ahead 4-1 in the third. Ke’Bryan Hayes had an RBI single, Stallings followed with a run-scoring grounder and Evans drove in two more as his sinking liner to right field popped out of a sliding Lars Nootbaar’s glove for a single.	“We didn’t get really any opportunities to get pitches to drive, so our guys did a good job of just putting the ball in play and continued to grind out at-bats,” Shelton said.	Arenado hit his 250th home run leading off the third, and Yadier Molina doubled, swiped third for his first stolen base since 2019 and scored on Nootbaar’s single.	Carlson’s opposite-field homer to left tied the game 4-4 in the fourth, his seventh home run this season and first in Busch Stadium.	“We had 12 men left on base,” Cardinals manager Mike Shildt said. “We clearly would have liked to do some damage in that situation, you know, 1 for 9 (with runners in scoring position). That’s not the consolation prize, but there were a lot of positive signs from the offense.”	MOVING UP	Molina’s double in the third was his 2,049th hit, moving past Johnny Bench for No. 8 among catchers.	STREAKING	Hayes has reached base safely in 29 straight games dating to Sept. 19, 2020, the longest current streak in the major leagues and the longest for the Pirates since Jason Bay’s 29 in 2005.	SLOW	Erik González was caught stealing for the final out of the second inning by Molina despite running on a 67.5 mph curveball from Kim. González was called safe by second base umpire Tripp Gibson, and the call was reversed in a video review.	TRAINING ROOM	Cardinals: OF Harrison Bader (right rib fracture) began a rehab at Low-A Palm Beach.	UP NEXT	The Pirates send RHP JT Brubaker (4-6, 3.77 ERA) to the mound against RHP Adam Wainwright (5-5, 3.74 ERA) and the Cardinals in the third of a four-game series on Saturday. Brubaker has been charged with two or earned runs or fewer in nine of 13 starts. Wainwright struck out 11 in his second complete game this season, a doubleheader opener at Atlanta on Sunday.	----	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN FRANCISCO -- — Johnny Cueto took the mound in his absolute element — a big, loud crowd back filling the ballpark seats again at last for a local rivalry game.	“When I looked around I felt really good,” Cueto said. “Seeing the fans supporting us makes me happy.”	And that energy fueled Cueto as he outdueled Sean Manaea, leading the San Francisco Giants over the Oakland Athletics 2-0 in the Bay Bridge Series opener Friday night.	“He’s a showman, he loves the spotlight, he loves the big stage,” manager Gabe Kapler said before the game. “The one thing we know about Johnny, every time he goes out there he’s entertaining.”	Curt Casali, a last-minute addition in place of ailing Buster Posey, does his job with little fanfare but it's plenty meaningful, too. He homered in the seventh to greet A's reliever Cam Bedrosian after speeding up his pregame prep with Cueto.	“It worked out,” Casali said.	Kapler appreciated Casali's poise, noting, "and that home run was huge, it was a big separator for us.”	With San Francisco leading the NL West, the Giants welcomed back a full-capacity crowd at Oracle Park for this rivalry series that is always a top attraction, and the game drew 36,928 fans. The famous Gilroy Garlic Fries stand had a steady line all night that reached back close to a quarter-mile.	And who better to pitch for the Giants on this special occasion than the dymanic right-hander Cueto (6-3) — always ready to have some fun on the mound. He gave up five hits over seven scoreless innings, struck out six and walked one.	Manaea (6-4) struck out seven and walked three, allowed one run on three hits over six innings, and also had a pair of hits.	“I love to hit,” he said. “It's a lot of fun.”	He doubled in the third for his first career extra-base hit and the first baserunner against Cueto with two out in the third. Adding to the moment, Manaea's helmet flew off as he rounded first with the dugout going crazy in delight.	It was Manaea's second career hit, his other coming in 2018. He then singled in the fifth.	The left-hander retired Austin Slater on a 10-pitch at-bat to end the third. He walked the first two batters in the sixth and escaped, striking out Donovan Solano to end the inning. Manaea struck out the side in order in the second for four Ks through two scoreless innings.	Brandon Crawford hit an RBI single in the fourth.	“Close game like that one hit ends up beating you,” A’s manager Bob Melvin said. “Unfortunately we just couldn’t do enough offensively to give him some support. He pitched great.”	Posey was a late scratch because of low back tightness, with Casali called into duty.	Jake McGee finished the 2-hour, 23-minute game for his 15th save as San Francisco won for the ninth time in 10 games. The Giants certainly appreciated Cueto's fast work after they played a nearly five-hour game winning in 13 innings against the Angels on Wednesday in Anaheim.	After going 1-5 against the A's during the shortened 2020 season, San Francisco improved to 15-6 in June and has either won or split its last nine series.	MAYORS PITCH	The mayors from each city, Oakland's Libby Schaaf and London Breed of San Francisco, threw out the ceremonial first pitches. Breed threw both arms into the air in triumph after throwing her ball.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: LF Mark Canha, who exited in the third inning Wednesday in Anaheim, went on the 10-day injured list with a strained left hip that has some tendinitis. ... Ramón Laureano was back in center field after two games as DH and one in right field versus the Angels to take pressure off a strained right hip that kept him out 17 games.	Giants: 1B Brandon Belt was placed on the 10-day injured list with inflammation in his right knee. Surgery is a possibility. “He understands that this is probably not a 10-day injury and he understands that there's going to be a rehab process here, and I imagine that's difficult,” Kapler said. “... I don't think he's in a particularly good space around this but I think that he also understands that it's important that he keeps a mindset that he's going to help us a lot this season and that the beginning parts of this rehab are going to be important for him to hit the ground running.” ... 3B Evan Longoria (sprained left shoulder) is beginning light baseball activity in Arizona. ... RHP Logan Webb (strained pitching shoulder) will pitch a simulated inning Sunday and could begin rehab games next week. ... INF Tommy La Stella jammed his throwing thumb in his recovery from a strained left hamstring. X-rays were negative but it's likely keeping him out a few days from playing rehab games with Triple-A Sacramento.	ROSTER MOVES	The Giants recalled OF LaMonte Wade Jr. from Sacramento to fill Belt's spot, while Oakland recalled INF Vimael Machín from Triple-A Las Vegas to take Canha's place.	UP NEXT	RHP Frankie Montas (7-7, 4.79 ERA), 3-5 over his last eight starts, pitches for the A's on Saturday night opposite Giants LHP Alex Wood (6-3, 4.09).	------	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

SAN DIEGO -- — Hours after saying he would skip the All-Star Home Derby next month, Fernando Tatis Jr. put on his own personal power show.	Tatis hit three homers, energizing Petco Park with the most dynamic performance of his short but spectacular career, as the San Diego Padres sent the Arizona Diamondbacks to their record 24th straight road loss, 11-5 Friday night.	“I have always wanted to hit three or four home runs in a game since I was a kid," he said after leading the Padres to their eighth win in a row. “I’m glad today I did that.”	Tatis hammered a changeup from Corbin Martin over the left-center wall for a solo home run in the first inning. Tatis connected again in the second for another solo shot on an 80 mph curve from Riley Smith.	In Tatis’ third at-bat, also against Smith, he hit a 415-foot, two-run smash to dead center to put the Padres up 8-5.	The 22-year-old shortstop got two more chances at becoming the 19th player to share the record of four homers in a game.	With the crowd standing and chanting, Tatis hit a sharp single in the seventh inning and then grounded out in the eighth.	“They did a pretty good job on me in the last two at-bats. They handled me, nothing you can do with that. I felt like I missed one pitch and could have hit it out again," he said.	This was the first three-homer game of Tatis’ career. The last player to hit four in a game was J.D. Martinez, doing it for the Diamondbacks on Sept. 4, 2017, against the Dodgers.	Tatis is tied with Vladimir Guerrero Jr. of Toronto for the major league lead with 25 home runs. Guerrero also says he won’t take part in the All-Star Home Run Derby that will be held at Denver’s Coors Field on July 12.	In saying he was out of the competition, Tatis cited his left shoulder, which he said is at 75% following an injury early this season.	Tatis sustained a partial dislocation during a hard swing against San Francisco. He went on the 10-day injured list and returned April 16, then left last Saturday’s game against Cincinnati after diving for a ball at shortstop and re-injuring the shoulder.	“My body is feeling a little bit better and we are getting back on track,” Tatis said. “I am just playing shortstop out there and having fun.”	Tatis leads the NL with 54 RBI and 15 stolen bases.	Tatis also dazzled on defense against Arizona, making a superb, charging, full-speed grab and throw on a slow roller hit by Christian Walker for the final out in the sixth. Tatis made another similar play to end the game on a slow grounder by Tim Locastro.	“It’s been an amazing time. Seeing full capacity, it just hypes us. It gives us way more energy,” Tatis said. “You can feel the fans, the energy, you want to play your best.”	While Tatis came close to making history, the Diamondbacks continued their dubious run. Arizona hasn’t won on the road in exactly two months, with its last victory away from Chase Field coming on April 25 when Madison Bumgarner threw seven no-hit innings to win in Atlanta.	The Diamondbacks have lost 20 of 21 overall and 34 of 37.	Tommy Pham and Jake Cronenworth also homered for the Padres. Nick Ramirez (1-1) got the win.	Martin (0-3) took the loss.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Diamondbacks: OF Ketel Marte (left hamstring tightness) was available off the bench, according to manager Torey Lovullo. Marte was hurt running the bases Tuesday vs. Milwaukee. He is expected to return to the lineup this weekend….RHP J.B. Bukauskas (right elbow flexor strain) threw a bullpen session on Thursday and is expected to start a rehab assignment soon.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: RHP Merrill Kelly (3-7, 5.06) pitches in a Saturday night start.	Padres: RHP Dinelson Lamet (2-2, 2.81) takes the hill in the second game of the series.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

LOS ANGELES -- — After suffering a three-game sweep at San Diego and then being no hit by the Chicago Cubs the previous night, it would have been understandable if AJ Pollock and the Los Angeles Dodgers were reeling a bit in what has been an abysmal week so far.	But Pollock and the rest of the defending World Series champions can exhale a bit after Friday night.	Pollock and Max Muncy homered during the eighth inning as the Dodgers rebounded with a 6-2 victory over the Cubs to snap a four-game losing streak.	One day after being no-hit by four Chicago pitchers , the Dodgers got eight hits on Friday night, including three home runs.	“When you score runs late it takes off some of the pressure for sure,” Pollock said. “The clubhouse was good before the game. What are you going to do? Stuff happens.”	After Gavin Lux drew a walk to lead off the inning, Pollock drove a sinker by Ryan Tepera (0-1) just past the outstretched glove of left fielder Joc Pederson for the go-ahead runs.	Muncy added another two-run shot to right field to provide insurance for Los Angeles, which snapped a four-game losing streak. Muncy, who has gone deep 15 times this season, has hits in three of five games since being activated off the injured list earlier this week.	Even though Pollock tried to imply that they weren't rattled, manager Dave Roberts said the stress level definitely ramped up during the late innings.	“There's that sense of urgency. When you're in the middle of a losing streak and at home, the crowd is waiting for us to do something,” Roberts said. “We needed that home run (by Pollock). You could sense it in the dugout.”	Zach McKinstry also went deep for the Dodgers. Blake Treinen (2-3), the sixth of seven pitchers who got the call from Roberts, pitched 1 2/3 scoreless innings.	Kris Bryant homered and Jason Heyward had two of the Cubs' five hits.	Bryant, who came in batting 8 for 64 in his last 19 games, gave the Cubs a 1-0 lead two batters into the game with a solo shot to left-center. It was homer No. 15 on the year and his second in the past three games.	The Dodgers evened it at 1 in the second when Cody Bellinger scored on a sharp grounder by Lux to first base that went off Anthony Rizzo's glove. Javier Báez, who was playing in shallow right on the shift, was able to get to get the ball and throw out Lux at first.	McKinstry gave the Dodgers a 2-1 lead in the third when he drove Jake Arrieta’s pitch just over the wall in center in for his fourth home run of the year and first since April 14. Los Angeles loaded the bases with two outs later in the inning, but second baseman Ian Happ made a diving catch on Will Smith's line drive to end the threat.	Los Angeles also had the bases loaded with two outs in the fifth, but Lux grounded out to first.	Chicago tied it in the seventh when Heyward came home on Pederson's sacrifice fly to right field.	FOR STARTERS	The only hit Los Angeles starter Tony Gonsolin allowed was Bryant's home run. The right-hander went four innings and struck out seven and issued two walks. It is Gonsolin's longest outing in his three starts since being activated off the injured list on June 9 after being sidelined for two months due to right shoulder inflammation.	Arrieta retired the Dodgers in order in the first before running into some trouble the remaining four innings. The righty — who has not won since May 25 and is 0-2 in his last six outings — went five innings and allowed two runs on five hits. He also had four strikeouts and walked three.	“I think he threw the ball pretty well. He looked sharp on his breaking stuff and used both sides of the plate well,” Cubs manager David Ross said of Arrieta.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: C Wilson Contreras had some bruising on his hand after being hit by a pitch during the sixth inning, but remained in the game. ... RHP Dillion Maples (right triceps strain) will begin a rehab assignment at Triple-A Iowa on Saturday. ... LHP Justin Steele (right hamstring strain) and RHP Trevor Williams (appendicitis) both had successful bullpen sessions on Thursday and will begin their rehab assignments in Iowa on Sunday.	Dodgers: SS Corey Seager (broken right hand) fielded some ground balls in the infield. He will be working out with the team the remainder of the homestand with a possible rehab assignment to be determined.	UP NEXT	Dodgers LHP Julio Urias (9-3, 3.99) attempts to become the third pitcher in the majors to reach 10 wins this season, but he had his shortest outing of the season last Monday at San Diego, allowing six runs in four innings. Cubs RHP Alec Mills (3-1, 5.18 ERA) is looking for his second straight win after throwing five scoreless innings on June 20 against Miami.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

DETROIT -- — Zack Short's first home run in the majors broke a fifth-inning tie and helped Casey Mize and the Detroit Tigers snap the Houston Astros' 11-game winning streak with a 3-1 victory to open Saturday's doubleheader.	“I knew I hit it pretty well, but I saw (right fielder Kyle) Tucker getting ready to jump,” Short said. “When he didn't get it, I definitely blacked out. That's an incredible feeling.”	The Astros were trying to tie the franchise record of 12 wins in a row. They got off to a good start, as Jose Altuve began the game with a single and took third on Michael Brantley's single.	“We've been scoring a lot of runs lately, and we had a chance to get off to the races again there,” Astros manager Dusty Baker said. “We had some pretty good hitters coming up, too.”	Mize, though, struck out Yuli Gurriel and Yordan Alvarez before retiring Carlos Correa on a comebacker.	Tigers manager A.J. Hinch wasn't surprised that his young ace escaped the inning.	“He's a really good pitcher -- we know what he's capable of doing,” Hinch said. “He didn't worry about the runner at third, he went right after Yuli and Alvarez and still had to get Carlos.”	Mize (5-4) improved to 2-0 in his last four starts, giving up one run on six hits and two walks in six innings. He struck out five to beat the Astros for the second time this season.	“I had some success down there against them, so I've been watching that start back,” he said. “I had a lot of success with my splitter against them, so I used that a lot today.”	Jose Cisnero pitched the seventh for his third save.	Short, called up as Detroit's 27th man for the doubleheader, had his first career extra-base hit on a third-inning double, then homered off Framber Valdez in the fifth.	“We know we can trust Zack in the field and he's got some pop," Hinch said. “He isn't always going to be going back after days like this.”	Valdez (4-1) lost for the first time in six starts this season, allowing three runs on six hits in a six-inning complete game. He struck out six without walking a hitter.	“I felt good out there,” he said. “I thought my only mistake was hanging the one pitch to (Short). I was good other than that.”	Valdez and Mize were both starting for the first time since umpires started checking pitchers on Monday. Valdez's spin rate was down 8% on his sinker and 7% on his curve, while Mize's four-seam fastball was down 8% and his sinker was down 10%.	The spin rate on Mize's splitter was down 23% and the velocity dropped from 86.8 to 83.8 -- but that was intentional for a pitcher who has struggled with overthrowing the pitch.	“That's a feel pitch for Casey with a power-pitch delivery,” Hinch said. “He really did a nice job with it today.”	The Tigers took a 1-0 lead in the second on Isaac Paredes' sacrifice fly, but Correa tied the game with an RBI single in the third.	In the fifth, Paredes led off with an infield single, took second on Jake Rogers' sacrifice bunt and scored when Short hit a 1-1 changeup just over the right-field fence.	MOVES	Astros: Recalled RHP Andre Scrubb to be the 27th man for the doubleheader.	Tigers: Recalled Short to serve as the 27th man. Short came into the game with three singles in five career games, and could stay up to fill Detroit's shortstop weakness.	SWAMPY WEATHER	Nearly seven inches of rain fell at Comerica Park between Friday and Saturday morning, causing flooding on many local streets and freeways. However, the field was ready to go for the 1:10 start of the opening game.	Southern Michigan was hit by more storms on Saturday afternoon, but they stayed north of downtown.	UP NEXT	Lance McCullers Jr. (4-1, 2.90), whose father pitched briefly for the Tigers in 1990, will face Detroit's Wily Peralta (0-1, 7.11) in the nightcap.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO -- — Just sweat and rosin. That is Hector Santiago's story, and he's sticking to it.	Santiago became the first player to be ejected as part of Major League Baseball’s new foreign substance protocols when he was thrown out of the Seattle Mariners' 3-2 victory over the Chicago White Sox on Sunday.	Santiago was checked by the umpires as he exited in the fifth inning. His glove was confiscated, and it was later announced that Santiago had been ejected.	“He was ejected for when his glove was inspected, for having a foreign substance that was sticky on the inside palm of his glove,” crew chief Tom Hallion told a pool reporter.	Santiago, a 33-year-old left-hander who began his career with the White Sox, said what the umpires found was a combination of rosin and sweat. He had used rosin to stop the sweat from dripping on both his arms on a humid day in Chicago.	“I think once they take it back and check, it’s just sweat and rosin,” Santiago said. “They’re going to inspect it and all this science stuff and it’s going to be sweat and rosin.”	Major league umpires last week started regular checks of all pitchers for sticky substances used to get a better grip on the balls, but can also increase the spin of the balls and make hitting them more difficult.	Santiago could be suspended for 10 games, but there is an appeals process.	“This is part of it, this is what we have to do, this is part of the game, we’re going to get caught if we’re going to use any substances,” Santiago said. “My mindset was just use rosin and attack the zone, that’s what I’m trying to do. I know that I didn’t use anything today.”	Taylor Trammell homered twice for Seattle, which improved to 10-2 in its last 12 games. Paul Sewald (5-2) got one out for the win, and Kendall Graveman worked the ninth for his seventh save.	The White Sox lost AL MVP José Abreu when he was hit on his left knee by a pitch in the sixth. The team announced the first baseman had a bruised left knee and X-rays were negative.	“You definitely never want to see that happen, especially to pretty much the backbone of the team,” White Sox pitcher Dallas Keuchel said. “We’re all hoping it’s nothing major but we’re already hampered as it is. We’re all hoping for the best for Jose.”	The teams played 2 1/2 innings Saturday before the game was postponed because of rain.	Trammell connected for his seventh homer in the fifth, and Ty France went deep against Keuchel in the sixth. Leury García hit an RBI single in the fifth for Chicago, and Yasmani Grandal added a tying sacrifice fly in the sixth.	The Mariners went ahead to stay when Trammell hit a towering drive into the right-field bleachers with two out in the ninth against Liam Hendriks (3-2).	“Unbelievable game,” Mariners manager Scott Servais said. “Taylor was locked in. That’s one of the best closers in the game.”	Grandal led off the bottom half with a base hit, but Jake Lamb flied out and Yermín Mercedes bounced into a double play.	The teams will play a seven-inning game for the series finale later Sunday.	Keuchel allowed six hits, struck out four and walked one in his first relief appearance since Aug. 6, 2013.	The AL Central-leading White Sox have dropped seven of eight.	ROSTER MOVE	Seattle placed left-hander Marco Gonzales on the paternity list and recalled right-hander Yohan Ramirez from Triple-A Tacoma.	TRAINER’S ROOM	White Sox: RHP Michael Kopech (strained left hamstring) will throw a simulated game on Monday, and manager Tony La Russa said the team will decide whether he is ready or needs a rehab stint with Triple-A Charlotte.	UP NEXT	Mariners: Following an off day, RHP Chris Flexen (6-3, 3.87 ERA) starts Tuesday night in the opener of a three-game series against Toronto in Buffalo, New York. LHP Robbie Ray (5-3, 3.35 ERA) gets the ball for the Blue Jays.	White Sox: RHP Lucas Giolito (5-5, 3.80 ERA) starts Monday in the opener of a four-game set against Minnesota. RHP Kenta Maeda (3-2, 4.85 ERA) takes the mound for the Twins.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

ST. LOUIS -- — Adam Wainwright pitched into the seventh inning, Paul Goldschmidt and Paul DeJong hit solo home runs and the St. Louis Cardinals ended a five-game losing streak, beating the Pittsburgh Pirates 3-1 Saturday.	The 39-year-old Wainwright (6-5) again stepped up as the Cardinals' stopper. Since June 9, he has broken St. Louis skids of six, three, two and five games.	“When things are going bad, you have to keep fighting,” Wainwright said. “You have to expect things to turn around. When you give up is when it doesn’t turn around. We have quality big league players who have won before. When you stop believing is when it’s not possible."	Wainwright allowed one run and six hits, and was pulled after giving up a leadoff single in the seventh. He struck out eight and walked one.	“I like going out and pitching and competing. I like having something on the line,” Wainwright said. “I seem to excel in those situations most of the time. I like those spots. I like pressure. I get along great with pressure. If you’re not used to pressure, this is the wrong occupation for you. We needed a win today.”	Now in his 16th major league season, he has gone into the seventh inning in eight of his last 12 starts. Wainwright improved to 18-7 in 43 career outings against the Pirates, including 38 starts.	“We saw the breaking ball. He was able to execute it ahead of and behind in the count,” Pittsburgh manager Derek Shelton said about Wainwright. “That's what gave us a little bit of fits. He did a nice job of keeping us off balanced. This guy continues to redeem himself. It's a credit to him on how he takes care of himself. It's extremely impressive.”	Genesis Cabrera, Giovanny Gallegos and Alex Reyes each pitched a scoreless inning in relief. Reyes had a perfect ninth for his 18th save in 18 opportunities.	“The guys were in the right spots and they brought it home,” St. Louis manager Mike Shildt said.	JT Brubaker (4-7) gave up three runs on six hits in six innings.	“He did not have hit best stuff today,” Shelton said. “ Gave up two solo homers. He had to battle throughout the entire game. The fact that he was able to give us six innings and that’s a another sign this guy is going to be a good major league starter.”	Yadier Molina had two hits and drove in the other St. Louis run.	The Cardinals entered the game having dropped seven of eight and 18 of their past 24 games. The win snapped a 10-game losing streak to NL Central teams.	DeJong, back in the starting lineup after not playing Friday, put St. Louis ahead 2-0 with a solo home run in the second inning. The Cardinals scored in the first inning on a two-out RBI single by Molina.	“I’m just trying to help my team whenever I can,” DeJong said. “We got it done today and it feels good. I'm looking to drive the ball. It's in my natural ability. I don't have to do anything extra.”	Pittsburgh cut the lead to 2-1 when Gregory Polanco led off the fourth with a home run.	Goldschmidt, who also singled and drew a walk, hit a 470-foot homer to center field in the fifth.	“I hit it good and it carried out there,” Goldschmidt said. “We're trying to find a way to score some runs and win some games.”	In his previous at-bat, Goldschmidt just missed a homer as he flied out to the wall.	“That was just a four-seamer up and away,” Brubaker said about the home-run pitch to Goldschmidt. “He ambushed it. I wasn't expecting it. I wasn't just trying to lay a fastball in there, either. It was more of a surprising swing that he just hopped on. ”	BATTERY MATES	Wainwright and Molina made their 288th career start as batterymates, fourth all-time since records were kept starting in 1908. Red Faber and Ray Schalk of the White Sox are third at 306.	TOUGH CATCH	With his back to home, 3B Nolan Arenado ran along the line into left field, twisted and caught Polanco's fly as he fell to the ground in fair territory in the eighth inning with a runner on second base.	“Huge play in a huge spot,” Wainwright said about Arenado's catch. “That could have been a double and one-run game. A big-time play by a big-time player. He makes our jaws drop every day. He’s amazing. I'm glad he's on our team.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Pirates: RHP Trevor Cahill (left calf strain) has been slow to progress, the club said. He has not resumed throwing yet.	Cardinals: INF Edmundo Sosa was not in the lineup. He left the game Friday night with cramps in the sixth inning. ... CF Harrison Bader (right rib hairline fracture) started Friday in center, batted leadoff and went 1 for 3 in five innings at Single-A Palm Beach. Bader, 27, has missed 29 games since he was hurt May 24. Bader will stay through the weekend with Palm Beach. He will have a reevaluation Monday.

BUFFALO, N.Y. -- — Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit his major league-leading 26th home run, Teoscar Hernández and Randal Grichuk also connected and the Toronto Blue Jays breezed past the Baltimore Orioles 12-4 Saturday.	Guerrero edged ahead of San Diego's Fernando Tatís Jr. for the most homers this year.	Guerrero homered during a four-run burst in the third inning that also included Bo Bichette's RBI double and Hernández's homer.	“The way he's swinging the bat right now, every time he goes to the plate, you're waiting for (a home run),” Hernández said. “He's having a good time and working so hard.”	Grichuk hit a three-run homer in the fifth. Toronto scored four runs apiece in the third, fifth and sixth innings en route to winning its sixth of seven games. All 12 runs came with two out.	“It’s tough to get hits with two outs," Toronto manager Charlie Montoyo said. "To get that many runs with two outs, that was impressive. A great job by the hitters.”	Hernández, who added a two-run single in the sixth, described the mindset of the Blue Jays lineup.	“We're going to fight until they get (us) out," said. "Every time we have a chance to score, we'll try our best and try to be aggressive when the pitches are around the zone.”	Grichuk, who drove in four runs, and Bichette each had three of Toronto's 15 hits.	Pedro Severino and Cedric Mullins each had two RBI for Baltimore, which lost for the 15th time in 17 games and dropped its 21st of 22 road games. The Orioles snapped a 20-game road losing streak on Friday.	Hyun Jin Ryu (7-4) allowed seven hits over 6 2/3 innings, but yielded only two singles through the first six innings, during which he threw an economical 62 pitches.	Ryu was tagged for four runs on five hits in the seventh inning when he delivered 29 pitches.	“Into the seventh, we were thinking that we would ask him if he wanted to keep going,” Montoyo said. “His pitch count was low and he was dealing. It was almost like watching a no-hitter.”	Keegan Akin (0-4) allowed six runs in 4 1/3 innings. Konner Wade. a 29-year old journeyman, allowed six runs in 1 2/3 innings, and Alexander Wells, a 24-year old Australian, worked two scoreless innings in their major league debuts.	An MLB-high 10 Orioles have made their first big league appearances this season.	MANCINI AND THE DERBY	Baltimore 1B Trey Mancini, back this season after treatment for colon cancer, will compete in this year's Home Run Derby, according to Frontline, the agency that represents him. Frontline announced the news on Twitter on Saturday.	Mancini, who missed the 2020 season, leads the Orioles with 14 home runs this year.	MOUNTCASTLE TAKING STEPS	Orioles 1B Ryan Mountcastle, after drawing only one walk in 95 plate appearances between May 24 and June 23, has four in 13 during the last three games against Toronto. He drew another free pass in his first at-bat on Saturday.	“I see much better strike zone management,” Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. “He's done an amazing job of understanding and making adjustments.”	MANOAH ACCEPTS SUSPENSION	Toronto RHP Alek Manoah, who pitched six innings on Friday while his five-game suspension was under appeal, agreed to begin serving that suspension on Saturday. He will be eligible to return on July 2, when Toronto hosts Tampa Bay. The timing appears to work well for the Blue Jays, who will likely have Steven Matz (COVID-19) return to start Wednesday against Seattle.	Manoah was suspended in the wake of his ejection in Baltimore last Saturday, when he hit Maikel Franco with a pitch following back-to-back home runs by Mountcastle and DJ Stewart.	VLADDY WEARING THE MAPLE LEAF WELL	Guerrero, who was born in Montreal while his Hall of Famer father played for the Expos, set a new Toronto record on Friday night for most home runs hit in a season by a Canadian-born Blue Jay. With his 25th homer, Guerrero surpassed Michael Saunders, who hit 24 in 2016.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Orioles: SS Freddy Galvis left the game after pulling up on the way to first while bunting for a single in the second inning. Galvis was taken off the field on a cart prior to the third inning, since the visitor's clubhouse facilities for MLB games in Buffalo are temporarily located behind the outfield fence. “We don't have the results from the MRI yet, but we're definitely concerned,” Hyde said before confirming that an infielder would likely be called up for Sunday's game.	Blue Jays: LHP Ryan Borucki (forearm) did well in his bullpen session on Friday and will either throw a side session on Monday or live BP on Tuesday before starting a rehab assignment. ... C Alejandro Kirk (hip flexor), who will be eligible to come off the 60-day IL next weekend, has been in Trenton with the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons and was described by Montoyo as “building up to playing games” though there is no timeframe yet for a rehab stint.	UP NEXT	The teams will conclude their four-game series on Sunday with Baltimore RHP Jorge López (2-9, 5.68 ERA) facing Toronto RHP Ross Stripling (2-4, 4.33).	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- — Kyle Gibson showed the Kansas City Royals what an anomaly his opening-day start against them was, and just how good he has been for the Texas Rangers the rest of this season.	Joey Gallo sent balls nearly 900 feet with two big swings.	Gibson had a season-high 10 strikeouts over seven innings, Gallo hit two massive homers and the Rangers beat Kansas City 8-0 on Saturday, ending a more than month-long stretch without winning a series — or even consecutive games.	Gibson (6-0) allowed only three base runners, on consecutive singles and a walk to start the fifth, before getting out of that bases-loaded jam.	It was the 16th consecutive start for Gibson without a loss, including his 2020 finale before the first opening day start of his career April 1 at Kansas City, when he gave up five runs while recording only one out after the Rangers had scored five times in the top of the first. The Royals never crossed the plate this time.	“This guy has been dominant,” manager Chris Woodward said. “Outside of the game one, he’s been absolutely dominant.”	The veteran right-hander, whose ERA was 135.00 after the opener in Kansas City, now leads the American League at 2.00 after allowing only 15 earned runs over 89 2/3 innings in his last 14 starts.	Gallo hit a 451-foot homer in the fourth inning, a three-run shot that landed in the seats beyond and above the Rangers bullpen in right-center for a 6-0 lead. His two-run shot in the eighth was a towering 445-foot blast that hit the top of the batter's eye in straightaway center field. He has 15 homers this season, four in the last seven games, and the five RBI matched a career high.	“I’ve been feeling good at the plate. Today, got some results, got some pitches to hit, and and I didn’t miss them,” Gallo said. "At the end of the day, that’s the plan.”	Before taking the first two of the three-game series against Kansas City, the Rangers (29-48) hadn’t won consecutive games or a series since a three-game sweep of Houston from May 20-22, and had gone 0-7-2 in their last nine series. Kansas City has lost four games in a row, and 15 of 20.	Gibson had five strikeouts in a row in one stretch while retiring the first Royals 12 batters. The fourth ended with shortstop Isiah Kiner-Falefa’s leaping catch of a liner, which created thoughts of a possible no-hitter.	“It probably showed up a little bit more in my mind after that fourth inning when Kiner made that great play,” Gibson said. “I guess I’m always kind of thinking about that. I don’t ever want to give up a hit, a run. Whenever you go to the lineup the first time, and especially once you get into the fifth, it starts to creep into your head.”	The no-hit bid ended on Ryan O’Hearn’s leadoff single up to the middle to start the fifth. Kelvin Gutierrez then had an infield single before a walk to Jorge Soler. But Jarrod Dyson then struck out and Michael A. Taylor grounded into a double play on a chopper to third baseman Brock Holt to miss their best scoring chance.	“I faced that that guy in the past before, and he definitely looked better today than I remember,” O’Hearn said. “That was our shot right there ... a point in the game where we needed to capitalize”	The Rangers went ahead 3-0 in the second, after Kris Bubic (2-3) took over for opener Kyler Zimmer and hit Willie Calhoun with a pitch to start the inning that fractured the left forearm of the designated hitter. Jose Trevino had a two-run double and rookie Adolis Garcia got his 54th RB I on a single between two walks.	“Just couldn’t really get in a rhythm with anything,” Bubic said. “I didn’t do my job and put the team in a pretty tough spot.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Royals: Manager Mike Matheny said lefty Danny Duffy is feeling good, and that the Royals would “like to keep him that way.” Duffy on Friday night made only his second relief appearance in 122 games since becoming a full-time starter during the 2016 season. He threw two innings in his start Wednesday, when he came back from missing six weeks with a forearm flexor strain.	Rangers: Calhoun initially stayed in the game, though he kept grabbing near his left wrist while on the bases before scoring on Trevino's double. Andy Ibañez replaced Calhoun at DH in the third. Woodward said the Rangers didn't a full prognosis, but Calhoun will miss significant time.	UP NEXT	Jordan Lyles (2-5, 5.47 ERA) returns to the starter’s role for Texas after six solid innings in relief when the righty pitched out of the bullpen in what was supposed to be his last turn. RHP Brady Singer (3-5, 4.77) starts for the Royals.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- — Shane McClanahan pitched six effective innings, Brett Phillips drove in three runs and the Tampa Bay Rays beat the Los Angeles Angels 13-3 Saturday for their fourth straight win.	Manuel Margot and Mike Zunino homered for Tampa Bay. Ji-Man Choi had four hits and drove in two runs as the Rays improved to 6-0 against the Angels this season	“I'm going to tell you what it's like, it's like waking up on Christmas morning as a kid and seeing all the presents,” Phillips said. “All the exciting things that you can imagine when you score a lot of runs like that. Everyone is excited and happy."	Seven Tampa Bay players scored and eight had a hit.	The Angels have lost five in a row overall.	“We just got beat,” Los Angeles manager Joe Maddon said. “We've just to throw this one away and come back tomorrow and play it right.”	McClanahan (3-2) allowed three runs and four hits, all coming in the third inning.	“That's just baseball,” McClanahan said. “Reset my mind and kept attacking.”	Phillips, hitless in his previous 15 at-bats, connected on a two-run triple to deep center off Alex Cobb (5-3). He scored on a wild pitch during a four-run fourth as Tampa Bay went up 6-3.	Phillips added an RBI single in a five-run seventh that made it 13-3.	Cobb dropped to 0-6 in eight starts against his former team after giving up six runs and six hits in four innings. He went 48-35 with Tampa Bay from 2011-17.	Shohei Ohtani bounced an RBI double over Choi at first base and Anthony Rendon flared a two-run double down the right-field line off an 100-mph fastball from McClanahan as the Angels took a 3-2 lead in the third.	Ohtani's hit left the bat at 29 mph, the lowest to result in an extra-base hit since StatCast data is available starting in 2015.	“When you've got a lead, you've got to hold onto it,” Maddon said. "You've got to finish games off, all the different things that a winning team does. That is winning baseball, and that's what we have to do.”	Los Angeles scored twice in the first inning of Friday's 4-3 loss to the Rays.	The Angels loaded the bases later in the third when rookie shortstop Wander Franco was charged with his first big league error after misplaying Taylor Ward’s two-out grounder. McClanahan avoided further damage by getting a fly ball from José Iglesias.	Margot hit a two-run drive off Cobb during the second. It was just the third homer allowed by the right-hander in 11 starts this season.	Zunino hit his 16th homer in the sixth.	Franco went 0 for 4 and had his average drop to .105. He is hitless in 16 at-bats since having a homer and double Tuesday in his major league debut. He walked with the bases loaded in the seventh.	“Nothing that we're concerned about,” Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash said. “Yesterday he just misses a ball. He smoked a ball that the right fielder made a nice play on. If he keeps hitting balls like that, they're going to find holes.”	OHTANI!	Ohtani’s homer off a catwalk about 65 feet above the right-field stands Friday continued to be a topic of discussion.	Maddon believes it went farther than the estimated 453 feet.	“If it didn’t hit the ring I’m not sure it would have gone out” a laughing Cash said. “Nobody else can do what he does, both sides of the ball.”	Cash is also amazed at Ohtani’s foot speed.	“He gets down the line as fast as anybody I’ve seen,” Cash said.	BONUS BULLPEN	The Rays have the best AL bullpen ERA and a key contributor from the 2020 AL championship team, RHP Nick Anderson, is throwing off a mound and expected back in August.	Anderson (right elbow sprain) had an 0.55 ERA in 19 games last year.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Rays: LHP Josh Fleming (right calf strain) went on the 10-day IL.	UP NEXT	Angels LHP Patrick Sandoval (2-2) will start Sunday. Rays LHP Ryan Yarbrough (4-3) will either start or follow an opener.	----	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CINCINNATI -- — Luis Castillo pitched seven scoreless innings and Jesse Winker homered before departing with a hip injury, leading the Cincinnati Reds to a 4-1 victory over the Atlanta Braves on Saturday.	Castillo (3-10) permitted six hits, struck out six and walked two while improving to 2-2 with a 1.71 ERA in five June starts. The right-hander posted a 7.22 ERA through his first 11 starts of the year.	“His stuff was electric,” Reds manager David Bell said, “but so was his attack.”	Winker was 0 for 7 in the series before connecting for his 18th homer in the first. He grounded out to end the fifth and then left the game.	He was diagnosed with a right hip contusion and replaced by Shogo Akiyama.	“My hip was tightening up a little bit,” Winker said. “I am fine. I’d like to see how it feels tomorrow before I say I can play.”	Winker might have aggravated his hip making a diving attempt for Ronald Acuña Jr.'s double in the third.	Nick Castellanos extended his home hitting streak to 18 games with an RBI double in the third. Joey Votto added an RBI single, and Tyler Stephenson went deep in the eighth.	Atlanta right-hander Ian Anderson (5-4) allowed five hits, struck out nine and walked one in six innings. Anderson pitched six scoreless innings against the Reds in last year’s NL Wild Card series.	“He did a good job, it’s a tough offense to navigate,” Braves manager Brian Snitker said. “He pitched well enough to win.”	The Reds’ defense helped Castillo when Jonathan India threw out Guillermo Heredia trying to score from first on William Contreras’ double to end the sixth.	Stephenson homered off Edgar Santana. It was his third career pinch-hit homer.	Amir Garrett got three outs for his fifth save.	RISPY BUSINESS	The Braves are 2 for 18 with runners in scoring position in the series, after going 1 for 8 on Saturday.	“We’ve putting up good ABs,” said third baseman Austin Riley, who lined out to end the third with runners at first and third. “It’s frustrating. Mine, first and third, line drive to third base. What can you do?”	The Braves left 10 runners on base.	“We’re having a hard time stringing hits together,” Snitker said. “We’re making good contact.”	TRAINERS ROOM	Braves: RHP Mike Soroka will have season-ending surgery after an MRI revealed a complete re-tear of his right Achilles tendon. Soroka originally tore the tendon on Aug. 3 while covering first base. On May 17, he had exploratory surgery which indicated the tendon was healing properly.	Reds: RHP Tejay Antone, who missed 11 games with right forearm inflammation before returning on Monday, is back on the 10-day injured list with a right forearm strain. LHP Cionel Perez was recalled from Triple-A Louisville. ... RHP Sonny Gray was scheduled to make a rehab start at Louisville on Saturday. He is expected to rejoin the Reds’ rotation soon.	UP NEXT	The Reds look to win the series behind right-hander Tyler Mahle, who ranks fifth in the NL with 11.26 strikeouts per nine innings, is looking to improve at Great American Ball Park, where he has a 6.93 ERA in five starts as compared to 2.01 on the road. Left-hander Kyle Muller (0-1, 5.40 ERA) will make his second career start for Atlanta.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MILWAUKEE -- — Christian Yelich and the Milwaukee Brewers once again got a spark from a crowd that’s back at full capacity as they rallied in the late innings for a second straight day.	Yelich hit a two-run homer during a six-run eighth inning that gave the Brewers a 10-4 victory over the Colorado Rockies on Saturday. That came one day after Milwaukee  erased a four-run deficit to beat the Rockies 5-4 in 11 innings.	“It's an awesome feeling,” Yelich said. “It definitely affects the game. It has an outcome on the game when the fans are loud and the crowd's into it. I think we as a team feed on that and usually good things start happening for the Brewers.”	Omar Narváez had a tiebreaking sacrifice fly, Luis Urías singled home two runs and Willy Adames delivered an RBI double during that eighth-inning outburst for the NL Central-leading Brewers.	This weekend's series marks the first time there haven't been any attendance restrictions at American Family Field due to pandemic-related protocols. The Brewers played in front of 32,573 fans on Saturday after having a crowd of 31,140 on Friday.	“It gave us more energy, more focus,” said Avisaíl García, who went 3 for 5 with a homer and double. “I think when you have the fans in the stands, it gives you a lot.”	That Milwaukee crowd helped produce more misfortune for the Rockies away from Coors Field. Colorado's 6-30 road record is the worst of any Major League Baseball team.	“I'd say recently the bullpen inconsistency has come back to bite us,” Rockies manager Bud Black said. “Offensively, incrementally we're doing a little bit better than we were earlier in the year. But I've said it all along, you have to combine all three facets. You've got to hit, you've got to pitch and you've got to play defense to win a big-league game. So far on the road, it's been tough to put those three together.”	Milwaukee finished with a season-high 14 hits and improved to 4-2 against the Rockies this season, with all four Brewers wins coming on their final at bat.	The Brewers won 5-4 in 11 innings Friday after trailing 4-0 in the seventh. They rallied from a 5-3 deficit and produced two runs in the ninth to win 6-5 on June 19. They blew a 6-0 lead on Sunday but scored in the ninth to win 7-6.	“It’s not necessarily the opponent,” Yelich said. “It’s just kind of the way our team is, I think. It’s just been the Rockies because that’s who we’ve played a lot this past week. I think we just have confidence if the game’s close, we’re going to find a way, just do what we’ve got to do and push one across.”	Trevor Story hit a two-run homer off Brewers starter Adrian Houser to give the Rockies a 4-3 lead with two outs in the fifth inning. García tied it with a solo shot off Jhoulys Chacín in the seventh.	The game was still tied when Rockies reliever Carlos Estévez (2-1) walked Daniel Robertson and hit Manny Piña with a pitch to start the eighth. Jace Peterson followed with a bunt hit that loaded the bases.	On the ninth pitch of his at bat, Narváez hit a fly to center that brought home Robertson.	“He just keeps himself alive in at-bats,” Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. “It’s not always a hard-hit ball, but something good happens because he’s keeping himself alive.”	Urías followed with a two-run single up the middle past a drawn-in infield. Yelich then blasted Ben Bowden’s first pitch over the right-field wall for his fifth homer. The Brewers scored one more run on back-to-back doubles by García and Adames.	Brad Boxberger (3-2) pitched a scoreless eighth inning to earn the win.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Rockies: Black said 1B Matt Adams (elbow) “has been cleared to do everything at a high-effort level” and is potentially closer to a rehabilitation assignment. … RHP Mychal Givens (back) threw a bullpen session Saturday. … LHP Austin Gomber (forearm) is scheduled to throw a side session Sunday and Tuesday.	Brewers: 2B Kolten Wong left the game with tightness in his left calf. “We’re hoping it’s a cramp,” Counsell said. "We’ll probably know more tomorrow when he shows up and gets a little activity going.”	UP NEXT	RHP Chi Chi Gonzalez (2-4, 5.41 ERA) starts for Colorado and LHP Eric Lauer (1-3, 5.21) pitches for Milwaukee as the Rockies and Brewers conclude their three-game series Sunday afternoon.	------	Follow Steve Megargee at https://twitter.com/stevemegargee	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

NEW YORK -- — By the middle of his outing, Mets ace Jacob deGrom was struggling to find his mechanics that essentially made him a two-pitch pitcher.	“Jake is human, right?” New York manager Luis Rojas said. “So, these things are going to happen.”	A less-dominant version of deGrom gave up two runs for the first time this season and the Mets rallied after he exited, beating the Philadelphia Phillies 4-3 Saturday on Michael Conforto’s sacrifice fly in the ninth inning.	DeGrom’s bid to set the Mets record for the longest scoreless-inning streak fell just short. His run ended at 31 innings on rookie Nick Maton’s RBI single in the second — R.A. Dickey set the team shutout mark of 32 2/3 innings in 2012.	DeGrom allowed three hits in six innings, striking out five and walking one while throwing 88 pitches, his most since tossing 93 against Boston on April 28 in a 1-0 loss.	“I got really rotational probably from the fourth on,” deGrom said. “That front side was flying open, kind of lost the feel for the fastball and the slider, but the changeup wasn’t really there all day. So I had to try and battle and find a way to throw it.	“I was trying to fix it in the game, but I think me trying to fix it almost made it worse. I was fortunate enough to get out of there with only giving up two runs," he said.	The two-time NL Cy Young Award winner saw his ERA rise from 0.50 to 0.69, still the lowest by any pitcher through 13 starts since earned runs became a statistic in 1913.	DeGrom pitched with men on base in three of his six innings but was able to limit the damage. After allowing his first run, deGrom got a groundout from Ronald Torreyes and following his second run, he snagged Luke Williams’ comebacker.	Even with the mechanics limiting him to sliders and fastballs, deGrom threw 18 pitches over 100 mph.	“He wasn’t happy with how he threw the ball today, giving up two runs through six,” Conforto said. “That’s a pretty high bar, he’s set for himself and we’ve all set for him but he really is that good. When he’s on top of his game, he’s that good.	“You might get one off of him but when he has his stuff, good luck and that’s the kind of competitor that he is. He expects that level of play from himself," he said.	DeGrom also got another hit. His single in the fifth was his 12th this year and raised his average to .414.	After Mets reliever Edwin Diaz (2-1) allowed the Phillies to take a 3-2 lead on a sacrifice fly by Maton in the ninth, the Mets came back.	Travis Blankenhorn reached on a fielding error by first baseman Rhys Hoskins and Billy McKinney drew a walk from Héctor Neris (1-5). Kevin Pillar, who hit a tying, pinch-hit homer in the seventh, had an infield single that went under the diving attempt of third baseman Alec Bohm to load the bases with no outs.	Guillorme drew a tying walk from Neris. Francisco Lindor struck out, but Conforto lifted a flyball to center field for the winning run. Neris blew a save chance for the sixth time this season and the Phillies lost a game where they held a lead for the 21st time.	“I thought the guys did a good job off of deGrom,” Phillies manager Joe Girardi said. “We took advantage of some situations and got ourselves in scoring position. Guys got some big hits. But we’ve got to find a way to turn it around.”	Andrew McCutchen had a bases-loaded sacrifice fly in the Phillies sixth that made it 2-all. It came after deGrom hit Bryce Harper in the left calf with a changeup, and the Phillies star left the game after the inning.	“Got him, like, at the lower part of the calf,” Girardi said. “I’m not sure what I’ll have tomorrow. Just have to wait and see.”	The Phillies ended deGrom’s scoreless streak in the top of the second.	McCutchen hit a single that deflected off deGrom’s back and into center field, stole second and scored when Maton’s single to right dropped in front of Conforto.	It was the first run allowed by deGrom since giving up a homer to Colorado’s Ryan McMahon in the second inning on May 25.	The Mets tied the game in the second on Jose Peraza’s double.

MIAMI -- — Rookie Zach Thompson struck out 11 in six innings, helping the Miami Marlins beat Kyle Schwarber and the Washington Nationals 3-2 on Saturday.	Thompson (2-2) held Schwarber in check while allowing two runs and three hits in his fourth major league start. Anthony Bender and Dylan Floro each got three outs before Yimi García earned his 12th save in 15 chances, working around Josh Harrison’s leadoff single in the ninth.	“As long as I can keep going and keep us in a good spot to win a game, that’s really important for me,” Thompson siad. “Hopefully, six innings can kind of be a normal for me, and I can go even longer.”	Schwarber, who had homered in 13 of his last 14 games, struck out looking in the first and third against Thompson. He walked in the fifth, grounded out in the seventh and struck out again in the ninth.	“We have had our problems in the one-run games, not being able to get the big hit or giving up the run,” Miami manager Don Mattingly said. “It feels good to get a win here today.”	Thompson’s 11 strikeouts were the most at home by a Miami pitcher since José Fernández fanned 11 against the Nationals in his final start on Sept. 20, 2016.	“It’s really fun to do,” Thompson said of his accomplishment. “I’m just glad I was able to put my team in a winning situation.”	Jon Berti hit a leadoff homer in the fifth to give the Marlins a 3-2 lead. Berti drove Patrick Corbin’s 2-0 pitch over the wall in right for his fourth homer of the season.	“I got the pitch I wanted and put a good swing on it,” Berti said.	Corbin (5-6) was lifted for a pinch hitter in the seventh. The left-hander allowed five hits and struck out six.	The Nationals were 1 for 9 with runners in scoring position. They had a chance to tie it in the seventh after Harrison led off with a double, but Bender retired the next three batters. They put two runners on in the eighth and came up empty.	“We squared some balls up today, just couldn’t get the job done,” Washington manager Dave Martínez said. “Thompson’s curveball was pretty good.”	Juan Soto’s run-scoring double in the first gave the Nationals a 1-0 lead, but the Marlins responded with two runs in the bottom half. Jazz Chisholm hit a leadoff triple and scored on Starling Marte’s groundout, and Miguel Rojas singled home Jesús Aguilar.	“We put up a run there and you want to put up a zero no matter what inning it is but especially after we scored,” Corbin said.	Starling Castro’s RBI double in the fourth tied it at 2.	THIS TIME GARCÍA PREVAILS	In a save situation at Washington on April 30, García allowed Schwarber’s game-ending homer for a 2-1 Nationals win.	Schwarber had a 3-1 count in his ninth-inning at-bat Saturday before García got the count to 3-2 and struck him out swinging on a fastball.	PLAYING IT CAUTIOUS	Miami's Garrett Cooper homered and doubled twice Friday, but he was out of the starting lineup on Saturday. He walked in a pinch-hit appearance in the seventh.	Cooper was activated from the injured list Friday after being sidelined by a back strain.	“I knew I’d get questions about Coop not being in there today,” Mattingly said. “Obviously he had a big night (Friday) but we think it’s the best thing for his body. It’s the first time he played nine innings. So, he’ll get a recovery from that.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Nationals: 1B Josh Bell returned from a two-game absence because of right side discomfort. He went 1 for 4 with two strikeouts.	UP NEXT	RHP Max Scherzer (6-4, 2.19 ERA) starts the series finale for the Nationals on Sunday. Marlins RHP Sandy Alcantara (4-6, 2.93 ERA) makes his NL-leading 17th start.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

DETROIT -- — Yordan Alvarez and Carlos Correa hit back-to-back homers in the sixth inning and the Houston Astros rallied past the Detroit Tigers 3-2 to a split a doubleheader Saturday.	After winning the opener 3-1 and ending the Astros' 11-game winning streak, the Tigers took a 2-0 lead into the sixth of the seven-inning nightcap.	Jose Altuve led off the Astros sixth with a double against reliever Michael Fulmer (4-4). With two outs, Alvarez hit a 3-2 sinker into the Houston bullpen in left-centerfield	“I went up to the plate with a plan to look middle or middle-away,” Alvarez said. “I got one on the 3-2 pitch and I put a good swing on it.”	Two pitches later, Correa hit a ball over the Tigers bullpen for the lead.	“It's very impressive to see a kid of Yordan's age work a count and hit the ball that far,” he said. “Then I was able to hit one and give us the lead. That's huge with the arms we have in our bullpen.”	Nomar Mazara doubled off Lance McCullers Jr. with one out in the Detroit sixth, but Ryne Stanek came in to retire the next two hitters. Ryan Pressly struck out the side in the seventh for his 12th save.	“Ryan Pressly has my All-Star vote and that inning is why,” Astros manager Dusty Baker said. “He comes in and does the job with no drama. Stanek did the same thing, which is what you want from your bullpen."	McCullers (5-1) allowed two runs on five hits in 5 1/3 innings.	“I had great stuff, but they got a couple of bloop hits against me,” McCullers said. “We got a great win and now I can move on to the next start.”	Mazara and Jonathan Schoop had RBI singles that put the Tigers ahead. Detroit pitchers Wily Peralta and Kyle Funkhouser combined to blank Houston on two hits through the fifth.	“We had it set up exactly how we wanted it,” Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said. “Wily and Funk got us to the point where we could bring in the back end of our bullpen. It just didn't work out.”	In the first game, Zack Short's first home run in the majors broke a fifth-inning tie for Detroit.	Casey Mize (5-4) improved to 2-0 in his last four starts, giving up one run on six hits and two walks in six innings. He struck out five to beat the Astros for the second time this season.	The Astros were trying to tie the franchise record of 12 wins in a row. They got off to a good start, as Altuve began the game with a single and took third on Michael Brantley's single.	Mize, though, struck out Yuli Gurriel and Alvarez before retiring Correa on a comebacker.	Jose Cisnero pitched the seventh for his third save.	Short, called up as Detroit's 27th man for the doubleheader, had his first career extra-base hit on a third-inning double over center fielder Chas McCormick's head, then homered off Framber Valdez in the fifth.	Valdez (4-1) lost for the first time in six starts this season, allowing three runs on six hits in a six-inning complete game. He struck out six without walking a hitter.	The Tigers took a 1-0 lead in the second on Isaac Paredes' sacrifice fly, but Correa tied the game with an RBI single in the third.	In the fifth, Paredes led off with an infield single, took second on Jake Rogers' sacrifice bunt and scored when Short hit a 1-1 changeup just over the right-field fence.	MOVES	Astros: Recalled RHP Andre Scrubb to be the 27th man for the doubleheader.	Tigers: Recalled Short to serve as the 27th man. Short came into the game with three singles in five career games, and could stay up to fill Detroit's shortstop weakness.	SWAMPY WEATHER	Nearly seven inches of rain fell at Comerica Park between Friday and Saturday morning, causing flooding on many local streets and freeways. However, the field was ready to go for the 1:10 start of the opening game.	Southern Michigan was hit by more storms on Saturday afternoon, but they stayed north of downtown.	SAVING PERALTA	Hinch limited Peralta to nine hitters so that he can start again in Cleveland on Wednesday on three days' rest.	UP NEXT	The teams finish their season series on Sunday, with Detroit's Tarik Skubal (4-7, 4.33) facing Jake Odorizzi (2-3, 4.75) of the Astros. The Tigers lead the series 4-2 after an April sweep in Houston.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

LOS ANGELES -- — Cody Bellinger has spent more time on the injured list than on the Los Angeles Dodgers' lineup card this season. Even when healthy, the 2019 NL MVP has been batting .217 with little to celebrate.	One major swing against the Chicago Cubs just might put Bellinger back on track.	Bellinger homered with two outs in the ninth inning, and the Dodgers beat the Cubs 3-2 Saturday night for their first walk-off victory of the season.	Two innings after Bellinger came on as a defensive substitution in a double switch, he crushed a 422-foot solo shot to center off Keegan Thompson (3-2). Just about everybody but Bellinger knew it was gone.	“I knew I hit it well,” Bellinger said of his third career game-ending homer. “But I haven’t hit too many this year, so I wasn’t sure.”	The rest of the Dodgers were more excited about Bellinger's possible breakthrough, because they know what he went through to get there over the past three months.	Bellinger missed nearly eight weeks with a hairline break in his leg after getting hurt in the season-opening series in Oakland. After another stint on the injured list this month with a hamstring problem, he had just one hit in three games back, prompting manager Dave Roberts to keep him out of the starting lineup.	“It’s big. It’s real,” Roberts said. “We as coaches or teammates can say, ‘Hey man, you’re going to be there when you’re ready to go.’ But as a player, I think you want to feel you’re pulling your weight. ... For him to get that hit, I think it was big for all of us.”	Bellinger made a difficult catch on Joc Pederson's line drive to center in the top of the ninth, and then he hit his second homer of the year, setting off a celebration for the defending World Series champions.	“It’s not that I’m, like, searching for a big moment,” Bellinger said. “Just playing the game, and if you’re in those moments, then you’re in that moment and you just want to perform and succeed and help the team win.”	After Max Muncy and Justin Turner each drove in a run in the first inning, the Dodgers made 26 outs before Bellinger's blast. One night after snapping a four-game skid, Los Angeles won for the second time since four Cubs pitchers combined for a no-hitter at Dodger Stadium on Thursday night.	David Price (3-0) got two outs in the ninth while pitching for the third consecutive day.	Julio Urías racked up a career-high 12 strikeouts while pitching five-hit ball into the sixth inning for the Dodgers.	Anthony Rizzo homered for the Cubs. Alec Mills yielded eight hits in four rocky innings, but just two runs — none after his first three batters.	“I didn’t have my best stuff today,” Mills said. “Kind of was in and out of knowing where it was going, to be honest. ... Given the situation, to go four innings and only give up two with the kind of stuff I had was obviously a little bit of a success.”	Mookie Betts led off the game with a double, and Muncy doubled him home before scoring on Turner's single.	Urías got off to an outstanding start to the season, but the Dodgers' World Series-clinching hero came into Saturday hoping to end a decline in effectiveness over the past month.	“He looked fantastic,” Roberts said of Urías. “He was fantastic.”	The left-hander yielded just one hit in the first three innings, but Rizzo homered to right on Urías' first pitch of the fourth, blistering a high fastball on the ninth anniversary of the three-time All-Star's Cubs debut.	Ian Happ tied it with an RBI double in the fifth after batting for Mills.	TAYLOR (NOT SO) SWIFT	Chris Taylor was thrown at third base twice by Cubs catcher Willson Contreras in the first four innings. The LA veteran was nabbed trying to steal in the second, and he was picked off in the fourth. The second time cost the Dodgers a run, since Urías singled on the next pitch.	REVERSAL UNREVERSED	Cubs outfielder Jason Heyward thought he hit a tiebreaking homer in the seventh when his drive down the left-field line was initially ruled fair by third base umpire D.J. Reyburn. The umpires then reversed themselves after a group consultation, and video review didn't reverse the reversal.	"I had doubts on the original call, so I wanted to get together with the crew,” Reyburn said. “Based on the information they gave me, I wanted to change it.”	Heyward still singled to center, reaching base in his seventh consecutive plate appearance.	“They got together and conversed, and I guess they overturned it, and at that point all we can do is trust in the video,” Cubs manager David Ross said.

BOSTON -- — Playing against the New York Yankees seems to bring out the best in Nathan Eovaldi. His latest performance has the Boston Red Sox on the verge of a second straight sweep of their longtime rivals.	Eovaldi pitched neatly into the eighth inning, Adam Ottavino escaped a pair of late jams and the Boston held off New York 4-2 on Saturday night. The Red Sox improved to 5-0 against the Yankees this season.	It was a bounce-back night for Eovaldi (8-4), who was coming off his shortest outing of 2021 in which he lasted just four innings at Kansas City.	He was more composed at Fenway Park, keeping his fastball in the high 90s while allowing one run off seven hits, issuing no walks and striking out six over 7 2/3 innings.	“Tonight I felt like everything was working for me,” Eovaldi said. “The fastball command was there. ... I think that opened things up for the rest of the game as well.”	Eovaldi exited after DJ LeMahieu's homer made it 4-1 in the eighth. After Hirokazu Sawamura came on and issued three walks to load the bases with two outs, Ottavino got Luke Voit to ground out to end the threat.	Ottavino made his own trouble in the ninth, and LeMahieu hit an RBI single with two outs. But with two on, Ottavino struck out Aaron Judge for his fifth save in eight chances.	Judge said there's no big secret to how the Yankees can avoid another setback to Boston.	“We've got to score first, that's the big thing," Judge said. “These guys have put the pressure on us early in the game. ... We've got to flip the switch."	Ottavino, who spent the previous two seasons in New York before being traded to Boston in January, said it is still strange facing his former team. He said avoiding eye contact with the familiar faces was key to him staying composed late.	“The game’s are never easy either way,” Ottavino said, “Both teams really battled. Tonight they didn’t want to go away.”	Jordan Montgomery (3-2) took the loss, allowing three runs off eight hits, walking two and striking out five.	Trailing 3-0, New York had a chance to tie the game in the sixth when LeMahieu and Judge reached on back-to-back singles with one out. The inning ended when Gary Sánchez ground into a 5-4-3 double play.	The Yankees had a runner on with two outs the following inning when Gleyber Torres hit a line drive to center field. But the ball had just enough air underneath it for Kiké Hernández to run it down on the warning track.	Boston loaded the bases with no outs in the second inning and took a 1-0 lead on Hernández’s sacrifice fly.	It grew to 2-0 two pitches later when Voit got spun around hauling in Bobby Dalbec’s popup in foul territory, allowing Rafael Devers to tag and score from just ahead of the first baseman's late relay.	The Yankees appeared to get out of the third inning unscathed after Xander Bogaerts reached with a two-out double and Devers appeared to ground out on a close play at first.	But Red Sox manager Alex Cora challenged, and the call was overturned. Hunter Renfroe then legged out an infield single, allowing Bogaerts to cross home plate and make it 3-0.	Renfroe and Bogaerts each had three hits.	Cora said he was pleased with how the team played defensively, which gave Eovaldi and the bullpen the support they needed when the Yankees threatened late.	"They were in tune with everything," Cora said. “Games like that just gives you a chance for the pitchers only to get 27 outs."	TRAINER’S ROOM	Yankees: LHPs Zach Britton (hamstring) and Wandy Peralta (back) were both added to the 10-day injured list. Right-handers Albert Abreu and Brooks Kriske were called up from Triple-A. It’s the latest injury issue for Britton, who recently returned after missing the first 63 games of the season following elbow surgery. But manager Aaron Boone said they don’t believe this injury will keep him sidelined for long based on the early assessment.	Red Sox: LHP Chris Sale faced live hitters for the first time in more than a year Saturday, throwing 15 pitches during a batting practice session. He’ll throw another one next week.	SAVE THAT BALL	Red Sox catcher Connor Wong lined a single to right field in the second inning to tally a hit in his first career major league at-bat. Saturday was Wong’s second big league game and first career start.	UP NEXT	Yankees: RHP Gerrit Cole (8-3, 2.33 ERA) has 123 strikeouts through his first 15 starts, which are the most by any Yankees pitcher in his first 15 starts of a season, surpassing David Cone’s 120 in 1997.	Red Sox: LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (5-4, 6.07) is looking to get back on track after going 0-4 with a 7.94 ERA and .325 opponent batting average over his last eight games.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN FRANCISCO -- — The San Francisco Giants are the majors' first team to 50 wins, and backup catcher Curt Casali's steady contributions have been a huge part of that success.	The fabulous fill-in did it again with his bat, hitting a game-ending double in the 10th inning as the Giants beat the Oakland Athletics 6-5 on Saturday night.	Casali started behind the plate for a second straight day for ailing star Buster Posey.	"He takes a lot of pride in kind of serving his team, serving the pitcher, serving Buster, serving all of us,” manager Gabe Kapler said. “Pretty selfless individual.”	Matt Chapman hit a go-ahead sacrifice fly in the top of the inning after saving a run with a brilliant throw home minutes earlier but Steven Duggar quickly tied it on a single in the bottom half against Burch Smith (1-1). Duggar scored from first on Casali's hit that bounced to the deep corner in left to end the 4-hour, 5-minute game.	The Giants took the Bay Bridge Series opener 2-0 on Friday and have either won or split their last 10 series dating to May 25, matching the Yankees for the longest such mark in the majors this year.	“Awesome!” pitcher Alex Wood said. “If you love baseball and are even a casual fan, watching our lineup every night, it’s just unbelievable.”	Brandon Crawford scored the tying run. He had singled sharply to left with two outs in the ninth but LaMonte Wade Jr. was thrown out at home on Chapman's relay.	Chapman's fly came against eventual winner Jake McGee (3-2).	“It sucks definitely losing that game. It’s been a fun two games considering the atmosphere. It’s nice to play in front of a lot of fans and I know how excited the Bay Area gets for this series,” Chapman said. “We’re playing a team that has the best record in baseball for a reason.”	Donovan Solano hit a tying homer in the eighth after Chapman's two-run drive put Oakland ahead the previous inning.	A's manager Bob Melvin was ejected in the eighth by plate umpire Lance Barrett trying to defend catcher Sean Murphy, frustrated by balls and strikes with Jake Diekman pitching.	Sergio Romo was pulled after a two-out walk to Wade in the seventh, Diekman replaced him and immediately plunked Mike Yastrzemski before Wilmer Flores' RBI single made it 4-3.	Wade hit a two-run homer in the fifth then A's pinch-hitter Mitch Moreland hit a tying single in the sixth.	Wood struck out eight over 5 1/3 innings and exited after allowing consecutive one-out singles to Matt Olson and Jed Lowrie in the sixth before Moreland came through against Dominic Leone, who then got Elvis Andrus to ground out on a nine-pitch battle. By the late innings, a mist swirled above the outfield on a cool Bay Area summer night.	Andrus singled leading off the third and later scored on a wild pitch for a 1-0 A’s lead.	Wood struck out the side in order in the second on all called third strikes.	A's starter Frankie Montas allowed two runs on two hits over five innings, struck out five and walked three.	The right-hander took a line drive from Wade in the first but was fine to stay in the game then escaped a bases-loaded jam in the second.	MEMORABLE FINAL AT-BAT	A's third base coach Mark Kotsay glanced toward the batter’s box before Oakland did pregame work and recalled his last career at-bat playing for the Padres in 2013. He struck out against ex-A's teammate Barry Zito, then with the Giants before they both retired after that year.	Kotsay looked at the pitcher at one point and said, "‘Really, it’s my last at-bat, too,’ but he had 35,000 people on their feet,” Kotsay said. “Nobody I’d rather punch out against to end my career."	TRAINER’S ROOM	Athletics: Melvin hinted that LF Mark Canha, who went on the 10-day injured list Friday with a strained left hip that has some tendinitis, will be tough pressed to return right on time when eligible. “It's going to be every bit of 10 days and then we'll see where we go from there,” Melvin said. “That's a tough one for us. You talk about stability in the leadoff spot and being acclimated to that role is not an easy thing to do and he's done it beautifully.” Canha exited in the third inning Wednesday in Anaheim. ... RF Stephen Piscotty is resting his sprained left wrist after receiving a cortisone injection. “I'm not sure what day he's going to start to do some baseball activity but I know the last couple days it seems like he's turned a corner in how it's feeling,” Melvin said.	Giants: Posey missed a second straight game after he was a late scratch Friday because of tightness in his lower back. Kapler hoped to have his starting backstop behind the plate Sunday afternoon. ... RHP Aaron Sanchez is rehabbing a right biceps injury with Triple-A Sacramento but was limited in his outing Friday by lingering blister problems. “I'm sure Aaron's very frustrated that he hasn't been able to get back on the field and compete at the level we're all accustomed to for him,” Kapler said.	UP NEXT	LHP Cole Irvin (5-7, 3.98 ERA) pitches the series finale for Oakland opposite Giants lefty Sammy Long (1-0, 4.20). The teams play three more across the bay at the Coliseum from Aug. 20-22.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

SAN DIEGO -- — It had been 62 days and 24 road games since the Arizona Diamondbacks shook hands on the field after a victory.	“You can't imagine how good it feels," manager Torey Lovullo said after the Diamondbacks snapped their record 24-game road losing streak by routing the San Diego Padres 10-1 on Saturday night.	Merrill Kelly threw six strong scoreless innings and Eduardo Escobar had four hits and five RBI.	Escobar and Christian Walker homered for the Diamondbacks, who hadn't won away from Chase Field since April 25, when Madison Bumgarner pitched seven no-hit innings at Atlanta.	“I’m proud of these guys," Lovullo said. "We played a real good baseball game today, we had a good approach and we won our first road game in a couple months. It’s actually hard to even think about, it’s hard to say, but I’ve heard several people talking about it already so it’s a burden we’ve been walking around with and it feels real nice to get rid of.”	Baseball's worst team at 21-56 coming in, the Diamondbacks had dropped 20 of 21 games and 34 of 37 overall. They lost 11-5 in the series opener Friday night when Padres star Fernando Tatis Jr. homered in his first three at-bats.	But the Diamondbacks bounced back with a runaway victory against the Padres, who opened this homestand by taking four against the Reds and three against the defending World Series champion Dodgers.	Arizona managed to quiet the fans who had rocked Petco Park the previous eight games, which were the first since 100% capacity was allowed under the state's reopening plan.	Escobar connected for a two-run homer, and drove in runs with a double, a single and a groundout. He finished a triple shy of the cycle.	“No one comes to the ballpark to lose, but I still believe in my team and the talent on this team," Escobar said through a translator.	Kelly (4-7) allowed five hits, struck out five and walked none.	“This season has been not one that we set out to play, but anytime we can end a streak like that, it obviously helps not only for myself, but just the morale and camaraderie for the team, for sure,” Kelly said.	On Monday, Kelly threw seven strong innings and the Diamondbacks ended their record 17-game losing streak.	“You're always looking for that stopper, the guy in that rotation that's going to go out and execute the plan, and it's landed on Merrill a couple of times and we’re not surprised," Lovullo said. “He did basically the same thing at home, stopped that losing streak and we bounced on the the road, in a pretty hostile environment against a really good baseball team and he goes out and does a real nice job for six innings.	“I can't say enough good things about what he's did for us for a couple of big innings there where he really had to get after it and got some big strikeouts, some big outs," the manager said.	Arizona star Ketel Marte singled with one out in the first off Dinelson Lamet and then left the game with tightness in his left hamstring.	Lamet (2-3) left with one out in the third, one batter after surrendering Escobar's 17th homer. The Padres have been bringing Lamet along slowly after he missed his final regular-season start of 2020 with an elbow issue. He chose to rehab in the offseason rather than have reconstructive surgery. He has made it through five innings only twice in nine starts this year.	Padres manager Jayce Tingler said Lamet felt fatigue in his forearm and was having trouble gripping his slider.	Walker homered leading off the second, his fourth.	Tatis just missed a three-run homer in the fifth and ended up striking out.	Arizona shut down two big scoring chances for the Padres.	San Diego had runners on first and third with one out in the second before Kelly got the final two outs. In the seventh, San Diego had runners on second and third with no outs, and then loaded the bases with two outs before former Padres pitcher Ryan Buchter struck out Jake Cronenworth.	San Diego finally scored in the ninth, on Tommy Pham's single.	Lamet allowed four runs and six hits in 2 1/3 innings.	UP NEXT	RHP Zac Gallen (1-3, 3.67 ERA) of the Diamondbacks and RHP Yu Darvish (7-2, 2.50 ERA) of the Padres are scheduled to start the series finale Sunday afternoon.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO -- — Just sweat and rosin. That is Hector Santiago's story, and he's sticking to it.	Santiago became the first player to be ejected as part of Major League Baseball’s new foreign substance protocols when he was thrown out of the Seattle Mariners' 3-2 victory over the Chicago White Sox on Sunday.	Santiago was checked by the umpires as he exited in the fifth inning. His glove was confiscated, and it was later announced that Santiago had been ejected.	“He was ejected for when his glove was inspected, for having a foreign substance that was sticky on the inside palm of his glove,” crew chief Tom Hallion told a pool reporter.	Santiago, a 33-year-old left-hander who began his career with the White Sox, said what the umpires found was a combination of rosin and sweat. He had used rosin to stop the sweat from dripping on both his arms on a humid day in Chicago.	“I think once they take it back and check, it’s just sweat and rosin,” Santiago said. “They’re going to inspect it and all this science stuff and it’s going to be sweat and rosin.”	Major league umpires last week started regular checks of all pitchers for sticky substances used to get a better grip on the balls, but can also increase the spin of the balls and make hitting them more difficult.	Santiago could be suspended for 10 games, but there is an appeals process.	“This is part of it, this is what we have to do, this is part of the game, we’re going to get caught if we’re going to use any substances,” Santiago said. “My mindset was just use rosin and attack the zone, that’s what I’m trying to do. I know that I didn’t use anything today.”	Taylor Trammell homered twice for Seattle, which improved to 10-2 in its last 12 games. Paul Sewald (5-2) got one out for the win, and Kendall Graveman worked the ninth for his seventh save.	The White Sox lost AL MVP José Abreu when he was hit on his left knee by a pitch in the sixth. The team announced the first baseman had a bruised left knee and X-rays were negative.	“You definitely never want to see that happen, especially to pretty much the backbone of the team,” White Sox pitcher Dallas Keuchel said. “We’re all hoping it’s nothing major but we’re already hampered as it is. We’re all hoping for the best for Jose.”	The teams played 2 1/2 innings Saturday before the game was postponed because of rain.	Trammell connected for his seventh homer in the fifth, and Ty France went deep against Keuchel in the sixth. Leury García hit an RBI single in the fifth for Chicago, and Yasmani Grandal added a tying sacrifice fly in the sixth.	The Mariners went ahead to stay when Trammell hit a towering drive into the right-field bleachers with two out in the ninth against Liam Hendriks (3-2).	“Unbelievable game,” Mariners manager Scott Servais said. “Taylor was locked in. That’s one of the best closers in the game.”	Grandal led off the bottom half with a base hit, but Jake Lamb flied out and Yermín Mercedes bounced into a double play.	The teams will play a seven-inning game for the series finale later Sunday.	Keuchel allowed six hits, struck out four and walked one in his first relief appearance since Aug. 6, 2013.	The AL Central-leading White Sox have dropped seven of eight.	ROSTER MOVE	Seattle placed left-hander Marco Gonzales on the paternity list and recalled right-hander Yohan Ramirez from Triple-A Tacoma.	TRAINER’S ROOM	White Sox: RHP Michael Kopech (strained left hamstring) will throw a simulated game on Monday, and manager Tony La Russa said the team will decide whether he is ready or needs a rehab stint with Triple-A Charlotte.	UP NEXT	Mariners: Following an off day, RHP Chris Flexen (6-3, 3.87 ERA) starts Tuesday night in the opener of a three-game series against Toronto in Buffalo, New York. LHP Robbie Ray (5-3, 3.35 ERA) gets the ball for the Blue Jays.	White Sox: RHP Lucas Giolito (5-5, 3.80 ERA) starts Monday in the opener of a four-game set against Minnesota. RHP Kenta Maeda (3-2, 4.85 ERA) takes the mound for the Twins.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

The Blue Jays tallied 12 hits in closing out a four-game series with their seventh win in eight games. Five of those victories came against the Orioles, who have dropped 16 of 18.	Toronto got two hits apiece from Guerrero, Cavan Biggio, Marcus Semien, Teoscar Hernández and Reese McGuire. It was the Blue Jays’ 34th game with 10 or more hits, matching the Astros for most in the majors.	“The whole clubhouse has just great energy,” said McGuire, who is 16 for 30 at the plate over his past 10 games. “The guys are excited to show up every day and just expecting to win.”	Ross Stripling (3-4) earned his first win in four starts, allowing two runs and six hits in five-plus innings.	“We have a chance when he takes the mound,” Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said. “It’s funny because he wasn’t really sharp today, but he did the job.”	Stripling felt he was “not necessarily super sharp” pitching into swirling winds blowing off of Lake Erie, but he was pleased with the result.	“To go five innings, two runs, get the win, I’m certainly not going to complain,” Stripling said. “But against maybe some tougher lineups, you usually have to have better stuff than that.”	Patrick Murphy replaced Stripling with runners on the corners and escaped the jam with a strikeout and a double-play grounder. Tim Mayza got out of a bases-loaded jam in seventh, Anthony Castro struck out the side in the eighth, and Jordan Romano got three outs for his sixth save.	“If our bullpen regroups and does the job like we did today, we are going to win games,” Montoyo said. “Because we are going to hit. We are playing great defense. Our starters are doing a great job. So that’s the piece that we’re kind of missing."	Guerrero’s two-run double in the third gave the Blue Jays a 3-1 lead. Guerrero then appeared to score from second on Biggio’s base hit, but Austin Wynns tagged Guerrero’s hand just before he brushed home plate, and the call was overturned by a video review.	Baltimore got one back on Ramon Urias’ RBI double in the fifth, but Biggio made it 5-2 when he doubled home Guerrero and Hernández in the bottom half.	Orioles starter Jorge López (2-10) was charged with five runs and 10 hits in 4 2/3 innings.	“Honestly, only giving up five runs with the way the wind was today, blowing straight out to left field, you expected this would be more of a high-scoring ballgame,” Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. “But we had a tough time scoring runs."	Baltimore’s seven hits weren’t enough, but Hyde was encouraged by several at-bats.	Ryan Mountcastle hit his 13th homer in the first, breaking a streak of five games without a homer for the Orioles, their longest in nine seasons.	“That was a really good at-bat,” Hyde said. “Deep in the count, foul balls and then got something that he could hit and put a good swing on it.”	ALL-STAR VOTING	Five Blue Jays advanced to the second round of fan voting to determine starters for the All-Star Game at Coors Field on July 13. Toronto’s finalists are: first baseman Guerrero, who led all players with more than 2.7 million votes, second baseman Semien, the AL vote leader at his position, shortstop Bo Bichette, left fielder Hernández and center fielder Randal Grichuk.	Center fielder Cedric Mullins is the Orioles’ lone finalist.	MAKING MOVES	Baltimore called up infielder Domingo Leyba, outfielder Ryan McKenna and infielder Urias to fill out the lineup, and optioned right-hander Konner Wade and infielder Stevie Wilkerson to Triple-A Norfolk. Joining them in Norfolk will be right-hander Mickey Jannis, who cleared waivers after he was designated for assignment on Friday.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Orioles: SS Freddy Galvis was placed on the 10-day injured list with a right quadriceps injury after he got hurt running out a bunt single in Saturday’s game. Galvis could be out for a month or two, Hyde said. … 1B Trey Mancini, back this season after treatment for colon cancer, was held out for “a little breather,” Hyde said, but he pinch-hit in the eighth. … Mullins had a scheduled day off but pinch-hit in the ninth.	UP NEXT	Orioles: Travel to Houston to start a three-game series Monday, with right-hander Thomas Eshelman (0-1, 7.27 ERA) scheduled to face Astros right-hander Zack Greinke (8-2, 3.56 ERA).	Blue Jays: Following an off day, they begin a three-game series against Seattle on Tuesday night.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- — Shohei Ohtani hit his 25th homer and drove in three runs, and the Los Angeles Angels stopped a five-game losing streak by beating the Tampa Bay Rays 6-4 on Sunday.	Ohtani hit an opposite-field shot to left in the ninth against Pete Fairbanks. He also had a run-scoring double in the sixth and a tying RBI triple during the Angels' two-run seventh inning.	“He really likes the moment," Los Angeles manager Joe Maddon said. “He loves to play baseball. He loves to compete. He has a really high baseball IQ. He sees things and then goes in and does it.”	Ohtani has 46 extra-base hits this season.	“He can beat you in many ways,” Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash said. “He hangs in there against lefties. He's willing to go the other way, like he showed for the home run.”	Phil Gosselin put the Angels up 5-4 with his leadoff homer in the eighth against Matt Wisler (1-3).	Tony Watson (3-3) worked one inning for the win, and Raisel Iglesias got four outs for his 13th save.	Brandon Lowe and Ji-Man Choi homered for the Rays, who had won four in a row.	Wander Franco and Austin Meadows chased Patrick Sandoval with consecutive singles to start the sixth. After Mike Mayers retired Randy Arozarena, Choi’s three-run shot gave Tampa Bay a 4-2 lead.	Choi’s run, charged to Mayers, ended the right-hander’s season-long stretch of not allowing a run on the road at 14 games.	Franco had been hitless in 18-at bats since collecting a homer and double in his major league debut Tuesday.	David Fletcher opened the sixth with a single and scored on Ohtani's double off Ryan Yarbrough, lifting the Angels to a 2-1 lead.	Maddon moved Fletcher, who has a 12-game hitting streak, from ninth to leadoff. Ohtani had hit first the previous two games.	Tampa Bay was held hitless by Sandoval until Lowe tied it at 1 with his 15th homer with two outs in the fifth.	Ohtani walked, swiped second for his 11th stolen base and scored on an infield single by Gosselin in the fourth.	“He's special,” Rays catcher Mike Zunino said. “Being able to see him three days in a row hitting-wise is impressive. Then knowing every fifth or sixth day on the mound throwing 100 (mph), an unbelievable talent.”	Ohtani went 6 for 11 with two homers and five RBI in the three-game series. He has eight homers in his last 11 games overall.	Los Angeles had two on in the third when Fletcher hit into an unique inning-ending double play. His pop fly along the first-base line was caught by second baseman Lowe, who threw wildly to the plate with the ball ending up near the third-base dugout.	Yarbrough backed up the play and made a throw to catcher Zunino, who was up the third-base line but was able to tag Taylor Ward as he tried to score from third.	Yarbrough allowed two runs and six hits in six innings. Sandoval gave up three runs and four hits over five-plus innings.	FINAL CUTS?	Rays left-hander Rich Hill is looking forward to batting when he faces Washington on Tuesday night.	But the 41-year-old Hill knows that his time at the plate may be ending with a new collective bargaining agreement possibly bringing the designated hitter to both leagues.	“You get to play the whole game,” he said. “You get a hit, you get on base. You get to run the bases. You feel like a kid. It feels great.”	Hill is a .112 (26 for 233) hitter with five doubles and 13 RBI.	ANGELS ADJUSTMENT	Maddon said 23-year-old left-hander José Suarez could join the rotation this season.	“He could help us this year, we believe that,” Maddon said. “That definitely is on the horizon.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Angels: C Kurt Suzuki, hit on the mask by a ball on Wednesday, started.	UP NEXT	Angels: RHP Dylan Bundy (1-7) and New York Yankees RHP Michael King (0-3) are Monday night’s starters.	Rays: Following an off day, Hill (6-2) starts at Washington on Tuesday night. RHP Joe Ross (4-7) gets the ball for the Nationals.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CINCINNATI -- — Kyle Muller earned his first career victory, Ronald Acuña Jr. and Austin Riley hit solo homers, and the Atlanta Braves beat the Cincinnati Reds 4-0 on Sunday to split a four-game series.	Muller (1-1) who was recalled from Triple-A Gwinnett before the game, retired the first seven batters he faced and cruised through five scoreless innings, allowing one hit with a career-high nine strikeouts.	Muller’s first win came in his second start and third career appearance.	“It makes me feel like a big leaguer,” Muller said. “It’s really, really cool. Anyone coming into the big leagues is looking to have success early. Just knowing your stuff plays. It’s a big confidence boost.”	Five relievers followed Muller, with only Shane Greene allowing a hit, to complete the two-hitter. Ender Inciarte’s catch against the wall in center robbed Joey Votto of an extra-base hit off Greene in the eighth.	“Muller made a lot of good pitches,” Reds manager David Bell said. “He threw a lot of 3-2 breaking balls. We went deep into counts and almost broke through a few times.”	The Braves went 8-for-53 with runners in scoring position in the series, but Acuña got them on the board with a two-out RBI double in the third, and Freddie Freeman drove in Acuña with a single.	Acuña’s solo homer to center, his 21st of the season, made the score 3-0 in the fifth.	Riley led off the sixth with his 13th homer of the season, his first since June 13.	The struggles continued at Great American Ball Park for right-hander Tyler Mahle (7-3), who came in with a 6.93 ERA in five starts at home and a 2.01 ERA on the road. He gave up four runs on six hits in six innings, walking one and striking out seven, and was outshined by the rookie Muller.	“He used his secondary pitches to get himself ahead in counts,” Braves manager Brian Snitker said. “He was aggressive, had unbelievable pace.”	KEY MOMENT	The Reds had runners on second and third in the third inning, but Muller struck out Joey Votto to end the threat. Muller pounded his fist in his glove as he came off the mound.	“That was a big inning for me, more mentally than physically," Muller said. "Striking out a guy like that with runners on second and third, that was huge for me. I just needed to relax and make my pitches.”	REVENGE TOUR	Acuña's home run came after Mahle knocked him down with a four-seam fastball that rode up and in and struck Acuña's bat as he turned to avoid getting hit. Acuna Jr. then crushed Mahle's 3-1 pitch deep to center.	“It motivated me,” Acuña said through a translator. “The mentality becomes, there's no way I'm not going to get a hit this at-bat.”	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: OF Jesse Winker was held out of the lineup as a precaution after leaving Saturday’s game with a right hip contusion. He walked as a pinch-hitter in the seventh then took over in left field. ... RHP Sonny Gray tossed three scoreless innings in his rehab start at Triple-A Louisville on Saturday and could rejoin the rotation this week. “He responded well,” Bell said. “Physically, everything went well, so he's on track.”	UP NEXT	The Reds continue their 11-game homestand with a makeup game against the Phillies on Monday. The teams' June 2 game was postponed due to rain. The Braves begin a six-game homestand against the Mets on Tuesday.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DETROIT -- — Robbie Grossman's squeeze bunt in the 10th inning drove in the winning run and the Detroit Tigers won a duel of small ball, beating the Houston Astros 2-1 Sunday for a split of their four-game series.	The Tigers (34-44) went 5-2 against Houston (48-30) this season. There were a total of only seven hits in their final meeting this year, and Detroit needed just three to win.	“We can walk into the clubhouse knowing we just split with those guys, and we could have won three of four,” Grossman said. “That's a great feeling.”	Tigers manager A.J. Hinch isn't surprised his current team, which improved to 26-25 since May 1, has been able to beat his old one.	“This just confirms what we tell these guys every day -- this is a good baseball team,” he said. “We were terrible in April, and we don't need to revisit that, but now we are competitive against good teams and good pitching.”	In the Houston 10th, Gregory Soto (4-1) walked leadoff hitter Chas McCormick with automatic runner Abraham Toro on second. Jason Castro sacrificed the runners over, but Jose Altuve popped out and Myles Straw grounded out.	“We had a lot of chances in this series, and we didn't take advantage of them,” Astros manager Dusty Baker said. “A lot of that is the Tigers, though. They pitched well enough to beat us.”	Houston brought in Blake Taylor (0-2) for the bottom of the inning with Akil Baddoo starting on second. Jonathan Schoop's groundout moved the winning run to third for Grossman.	Grossman bunted Taylor's first pitch to the third-base side of the mound and Baddoo beat Taylor's desperate flip.	“I didn't quite get the ball where I wanted it, but I made the pitcher field the ball," Grossman said. “That's all we needed with Akil's speed.”	The play was Detroit's first game-winning bunt since John Hicks drove in JaCoby Jones in the 12th inning of a 3-2 win over the Tampa Bay Rays.	“We're playing to the strengths of the personnel we've got on the roster,” Hinch said. “We're trying to find ways to win games, and that one worked out.”	Houston starter Jake Odorizzi allowed two hits and a walk in five innings. In his last three outings -- two starts and a long-relief performance -- he has given up four hits and two walks in 14 scoreless innings, striking out 15.	“Everyone wants more innings, but I'm just happy with the results I'm getting right now,” he said. “If I can keep giving us chances to win games, I'll be happy.”	Tigers starter Tarik Skubal yielded one run on one hit and three walks in seven innings, striking out nine.	“I've never faced them before, but I obviously know what they can do against left-handed pitching,” he said. “The White Sox are tough on lefties, so I took a lot of that approach into this game.”	The Astros loaded the bases with one out in the fourth, but Skubal was able to escape with only a sacrifice fly by Carlos Correa. It was Correa's fifth RBI of the series.	“We had that young man in a lot of trouble in that inning, and he got right back out of it,” Baker said. “I don't know what round they got him, but he's as good as any young pitcher we've faced this season.”	Cristian Javier walked Willi Castro and Zack Short with one out in the Detroit seventh, but got Jake Rogers to pop out. Baker brought in Brooks Raley, and Baddoo tied the game with a soft single to right.	Both teams had two runners on in the eighth, but couldn't bring home the go-ahead run.	“Our bullpen really stepped up today,” Hinch said. “(Jose) Cisnero gets the strikeout of (Yordan) Alvarez to end the eighth, and then we got two great innings from Soto.”	MOVES	The Tigers kept Short, who had been called up as the 27th man for Saturday's doubleheader, optioning INF Isaac Paredes to Triple-A Toledo. They also placed RHP Michael Fulmer (cervical spine strain) on the 10-day injured list and recalled LHP Miguel Del Pozo from Toledo.

BOSTON -- — The Yankees were hoping a faster start might help them find a way to slow down the rival Red Sox.	Instead, Boston beat up on their best pitcher on the way to posting its most-lopsided win of the series.	Kiké Hernández and Rafael Devers homered in the first inning as Boston hammered Gerrit Cole, routing New York 9-2 Sunday to complete a second straight sweep of its longtime rivals.	J.D. Martinez and Christian Vázquez also homered for the Red Sox. Boston outscored the Yankees 18-7 in the three-game series at Fenway Park, improving to 6-0 against them this year and improving to a season-best 16 games above .500. It was Boston's first time sweeping New York in consecutive series since 2011.	With the Rays' loss Sunday on the road to the Angels, the Red Sox moved back into first place in the AL East.	“All around probably the best series we’ve played the whole season," manager Alex Cora said. "We played defense. We ran the bases well. We put pressure on them and we got timely hitting.”	Eduardo Rodriguez (6-4) was solid in earning his first win in nine starts. He gave up a two-run homer to Aaron Judge in the sixth but held New York to five hits and struck out eight in six innings.	“That’s what we’ve got to do with every team," Rodriguez said.	Cole (8-4) allowed six runs on eight hits, including three homers, in five innings. He walked two, struck out six and threw a wild pitch.	Cole's spin rates have slipped in recent starts, adding to speculation he’s had trouble adjusting to MLB’s recent crackdown on pitchers using substances to get traction on balls. He was checked by umpires for sticky stuff after giving up four runs and four hits in the first inning.	He said he was never able to locate his pitches where he wanted.	“I think everybody was well aware of the importance of the game,” Cole said. “It's a pretty brutal feeling to let the team down like that.”	Boston quickly put Cole and the Yankees in a hole.	Hernández jumped on Cole’s first pitch of the game — a 96 mph fastball — and drove it just over the top of the Green Monster for his seventh home run of the season. It marked the first time Cole had allowed a homer on his first pitch of a game.	Alex Verdugo then doubled and Martinez drew a walk. Xander Bogaerts flied out, but three pitches later Devers got ahold of Cole’s 100 mph four-seam fastball and crushed a drive 450 feet into the right-field seats for his 19th home run of the season.	"That crooked number was hard for us obviously to overcome,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said.	Never before in Cole’s nine major league seasons had he surrendered multiple homers in the first inning.	“After we scored those four runs, my mind was just go out there and put zero on the board," Rodriguez said.	Things got worse in the third when Martinez sat on Cole’s knuckle-curve and roped his 15th home run of the year to straightaway center to make it 5-0.	Trailing 6-2. New York loaded the bases with one out in the seventh. But Garrett Whitlock struck out DJ LeMahieu looking and got Judge to pop out to shallow right.	Whitlock said he hopes this series can be a spark for the Red Sox moving forward.	“I think the statement is we’re here to win," Whitlock said. "This isn’t just another year for the Red Sox.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Yankees: LHP Zack Britton (left hamstring strain) said before the game that he anticipates being ready to return after the minimum 10 days on the injured list.	Red Sox: LHP Chris Sale is set to throw two more innings of live batting practice on Wednesday. He threw 15 pitches in a BP session on Saturday.	“Teams are going to make moves in the upcoming weeks and try to improve. One thing for sure, nobody can trade for Chris Sale, right?” Cora said. “We can add Chris Sale to our equation and we’re very excited about that.”	NIFTY PLAY	With two out in the fourth, Gleyber Torres lined a ball off Rodriguez’s thigh, sending the ball trickling onto the infield grass. Rodriguez scooped it and flipped it to first baseman Danny Sanchez, who caught it barehanded in a close play to end the inning.	The play was challenged by New York but upheld on review.	UP NEXT	Yankees: RHP Michael King will make his sixth start and 13th appearance of the season in Monday’s series opener against the Angels.	Red Sox: RHP Garrett Richards (4-5, 4.74 ERA) looks to turn the page on his shortest outing of the season when he takes the hill for Boston’s series opener against Kansas City Monday.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

NEW YORK -- — Zack Wheeler threw seven scoreless innings against his former team, and the Philadelphia Phillies beat the New York Mets 4-2 on Sunday to split a four-game series.	Wheeler, who signed a five-year deal worth $118 million in December 2019 after spending his first seven seasons with the Mets, allowed four hits, walked two and struck out eight.	His final strikeout was his 130th of the season, lifting him into a tie with the Indians’ Shane Bieber for the big league lead. Wheeler, who lowered his ERA to 2.20, also leads the majors with 106 1/3 innings pitched.	“To me, there’s no question that he’s an All-Star pitcher this year,” Phillies manager Joe Girardi said. “You look at the innings that he’s logged and how deep he’s gotten into games for us and he saves our bullpen. He’s been one of the best pitchers in the game.”	The first-half success is a departure for Wheeler, who is 26-31 with a 3.96 ERA before the All-Star Break and 24-11 with a 2.90 ERA afterward.	“It’s something that you kind of always work for,” Wheeler said. “I’ve always had iffy first halves, so to get out on a good foot and just keep it rolling, it feels pretty good.”	The Mets had runners at first and third in the first against Wheeler (6-4), who set down the next 11 batters. In the fifth, he retired Jeff McNeil on a flyball to center to strand runners at second and third.	Jose Alvarado gave up an RBI single to Pete Alonso in the eighth and Archie Bradley surrendered a one-out homer to Kevin Pillar in the ninth before recording his first save for the Phillies, who led until the Mets’ final at-bat in an of the first three games of the series.	The Mets forced extra innings thanks to errors by Alvarado in the first game of Friday’s doubleheader, which they won 2-1 in eight innings, and by Alec Bohm in the seventh inning of the nightcap. A ninth-inning error by Rhys Hoskins sparked New York’s two-run rally in a 4-3 win Saturday.	“We got two (wins), but we could have had four,” Girardi said. “But we’ve got to move on and we’ve got to finish strong going into the break.”	The Phillies took advantage of some rare misplays by New York — which entered Sunday with 37 errors, the second fewest in the NL — to aid their small-ball rallies against Marcus Stroman (6-6).	With one out in the second, Nick Maton walked and Ronald Torreyes singled. Wheeler bunted to advance the runners but reached safely when second baseman McNeil dropped Stroman’s throw. Odubel Herrera followed with a sacrifice fly.	“That’s why I’ve always liked the NL — you’ve got to get the bunts down and move the runners,” Wheeler said. “It’s just the small things that add up sometimes. If you put the ball in play, some good things happen.”	In the third, Andrew McCutchen scored on Alec Bohm’s groundout. Maton laced an RBI double and scored after Luis Guillorme threw the ball away on Torreyes’ infield single.	Torreyes and McCutchen each had three singles for the Phillies. Alonso had a trio of singles for the Mets.	The Mets scored two runs or fewer for the ninth time in their last 13 games and are 5-8 in that span. Francisco Lindor and James McCann are the only opening-day starters to avoid the injured list this season for New York, which could get Brandon Nimmo back this week and J.D. Davis before the All-Star break.	“It’s tough to get going when you don’t have your pieces in there for just about every day,” Alonso said. “I think that the more that we keep grinding out, the more that we keep going along and progressing this season — I honestly think this team is ready to put up a bunch of runs consistently.”	Stroman, who exited his last start with a sore left hip after one inning, allowed four runs, two earned, on five hits in three innings while pitching days after the death of his grandmother.	MANAGERIAL MILESTONE	Joe Girardi won his 1,052nd game as a manager, breaking a tie with Jack McKeon for 57th place on the all-time list. Girardi is 13 wins shy of the next manager on the list, Frank Robinson.	UPON FURTHER REVIEW	Girardi and Rojas each won a replay challenge. In the second inning, Maton ran halfway home when a Stroman pitch eluded James McCann and was initially called out upon diving back to the third base bag. Girardi challenged and the call was overturned. In the seventh, McCutchen was ruled out after a replay review of his attempted steal of second.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Phillies: RF Bryce Harper (left calf) didn’t play, a day after he was hit in the left calf by a pitch from Jacob deGrom that bounced in the dirt.	Mets: 3B J.D. Davis (left hand) is expected to begin a rehab stint Monday with Triple-A Syracuse. ... Rojas said several other injured Mets should play this week for Syracuse, including IF Jonathan Villar (right calf), C Tomas Nido (right wrist) and RHP Jeurys Familia (right hip). Familia threw a bullpen on Sunday.	UP NEXT	Phillies: RHP Spencer Howard (0-2, 5.59 ERA) starts against the Cincinnati Reds in a makeup of a game postponed by rain on June 2.	Mets: RHP Jerad Eickhoff (0-0, 0.00) makes his second start for New York against the Washington Nationals in a makeup of one of the games postponed in April by the Nationals’ COVID-19 outbreak.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MILWAUKEE -- — Keston Hiura homered, doubled and drove in three runs to back a sharp performance by Eric Lauer, and the Milwaukee Brewers beat the Colorado Rockies 5-0 on Sunday for their fifth consecutive victory.	Lauer (2-3) struck out six over six innings of two-hit ball. After the Rockies loaded the bases with two outs in the second, Lauer retired 13 of his last 14 batters.	“To be able to escape that inning and then really just kind of get on myself a little bit more, like, ‘Hey, you need to lock it in a little bit better,’ it’s the push that I needed, I think," Lauer said.	Omar Narváez also went deep as the NL Central-leading Brewers completed a three-game sweep and improved to 26-9 in day games, the best mark in the majors. All three games in this weekend series had afternoon starts.	The Rockies have lost six of seven. They dropped to 6-31 away from Coors Field for the majors' worst road record.	Hiura went 2 for 4 while showing signs of breaking out of a prolonged slump. He was robbed of a third hit on a diving catch by right fielder Yonathan Daza.	After batting .303 with a .938 OPS in 84 games as a rookie in 2019, Hiura had an NL-high 85 strikeouts last year. He has struggled even more during a 2021 season that has included two stints in the minors.	Before the Rockies came to town, Hiura was batting .127 with one homer and five RBI in 38 games. He matched that RBI total in this three-game series while going 4 for 11 with two homers.	“There’s been some very hard contact, the damage to the baseball, which is what he’s definitely capable of doing," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said.	Hiura hit a solo homer and a game-winning sacrifice fly on Friday as the Brewers rallied from a four-run deficit to beat the Rockies 5-4 in 11 innings. 	In the third inning Sunday, Hiura drove a 1-2 pitch from Chi Chi González (2-5) over the wall in left-center. Hiura’s homer traveled an estimated 423 feet.	“I’m just trying to be consistent with every single at-bat, every single game and build off of that," Hiura said. “To be able to carry it over to the next day, the next day, the next day and just be able to put quality at-bats there, that’s what I’m really trying to work on, especially right now.”	That was it for the Brewers against González, who struck out four and walked two while allowing three hits over five innings.	“He kept us in the game through five, and we just couldn’t score for him,” Rockies manager Bud Black said.	The Brewers added to their lead once González left the game.	After Luis Urías singled to lead off the sixth, Narváez sent a 3-2 pitch from Lucas Gilbreath over the wall in right-center. Hiura brought home two runs with a two-out double off Justin Lawrence later in the inning.	Gilbreath faced only three batters, and each of them scored. Colorado's bullpen has a 6.51 ERA over its last 10 games.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Brewers 2B Kolten Wong was out of the lineup after leaving Saturday’s game early with tightness in his left calf. Counsell said it was doubtful that Wong would be in the starting lineup for Monday's game with the Chicago Cubs. Counsell said Wong could return at some point during that three-game series.	ROCKIES MOVES	The Rockies recalled right-hander Antonio Santos from Triple-A Albuquerque and optioned left-hander Ben Bowden to Albuquerque. Bowden had a 1-2 record and 7.94 ERA in 21 appearances.	UP NEXT	Rockies: Open a three-game home series with Pittsburgh on Monday. Colorado’s Kyle Freeland (0-1, 7.76 ERA) and Pittsburgh’s Tyler Anderson (3-7, 4.82 ERA) start in a matchup of left-handers.	Brewers: Begin a home series with the Cubs on Monday. Scheduled starters are RHP Freddy Peralta (7-2, 2.11 ERA) for the Brewers and RHP Kyle Hendricks (10-4, 3.84 ERA) for the Cubs.	------	Follow Steve Megargee at https://twitter.com/stevemegargee	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ST. LOUIS -- — The only thing that got in Max Kranick's way was the weather.	Kranick pitched five perfect innings in his major league debut before a 64-minute rain delay forced him from the game, and the Pittsburgh Pirates went on to beat the St. Louis Cardinals 7-2 Sunday.	“Crazy feeling, incredible feeling,“ Kranick said. ”I’ll remember this day forever.”	In a season in which there have already been a modern-day record seven no-hitters, Kranick (1-0) made a bid for perhaps the most unlikely premiere pitching performance of all-time.	The 23-year-old righty, who had never pitched above the High-A levels of the minors until this season, set down all 15 batters he faced against a Cardinals lineup that included All-Stars Nolan Arenado, Paul Goldschmidt and Yadier Molina.	Kranick struck out three and threw only 50 pitches, 36 for strikes. The Pirates led 7-0 when the rain forced a halt, ending the perfect-game bid by the 11th-round pick in the 2016 draft.	“He came right out executing his fastball and went right after a good lineup,” Pirates manager Derek Shelton said. “It was very impressive. It was unfortunate that the rain stopped him.”	Duane Underwood Jr. relieved to begin the sixth. He quickly set the side down before giving up a leadoff double to Dylan Carlson to begin the seventh.	Kranick became the first pitcher since 1893 to leave after at least five innings with a perfect game intact in his MLB debut, the Elias Sports Bureau said. He did so in front of 18 friends and family members.	Pittsburgh outfielder Ben Gamel was impressed.	“His tempo, he was making (great) pitches. How do you not rally behind that?” Gamel said. “He was quick, 1-2-3, 1-2-3. If you blink, you miss it.”	St. Louis outfielder Lars Nootbaar homered off Kranick earlier this month in a Triple-A contest. Nootbaar flied out in his only at-bat on Sunday.	Nootbaar complimented Kranick, adding, "we missed some balls that maybe we could have hit.”	Gregory Polanco and Ben Gamel each hit solo homers for the Pirates, who won have won six of nine following a season-high 10-game losing streak. Bryan Reynolds drove in a pair of runs for Pittsburgh.	St. Louis, which had three hits, has lost six of seven.	Reynolds stretched his hitting streak to 12 games with run-scoring hits in the first and fourth innings. It is the longest active streak in the National League.	Pittsburgh scored three times in the first off Johan Oviedo (0-4), who allowed five runs on six hits over four innings.	Polanco and Gamel homered in the fifth off reliever Jake Woodford.	Adam Frazier had three hits and reached base four times for the Pirates.	The Cardinals have lost eight of 10.	“We'll turn it around pretty soon,” Nootbaar said.	FIRST PITCH WIZARD	Former United States Olympic gymnast Shannon Miller tossed out the first pitch. The 44-year-old Miller, who won seven Olympic medals, did a midair flip off the mound before delivering the pitch to the plate. She is in town as part of the USA Olympic gymnastic team trials, which ended on Sunday.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Cardinals: OF Harrison Bader went 1 for 4 in a rehab stint with Class A Palm Beach on Saturday. Bader has missed 30 games due to a fractured rib suffered on May 24.	UP NEXT	Pirates: LHP Tyler Anderson (3-7, 4.82) will face LHP Kyle Freeland (0-2, 7.75) on Monday in the first of a three-game series in Colorado. Anderson has lost four straight decisions and five of his last six.	Cardinals: LHP Wade LeBlanc (0-1, 6.75) will take on RHP Jake Faria (0-0, 4.50) on Monday in the first of a three-game series against Arizona in St. Louis. LeBlanc, who was signed as a free agent on June 17, has gone six innings or more in five of 10 career starts against the Diamondbacks.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN FRANCISCO -- — Cole Irvin struck out eight in eight innings to remain unbeaten in five June starts, and the Oakland Athletics beat the San Francisco Giants 6-2 on Sunday.	Matt Chapman had two hits and two RBI. Aramís García added a pair of RBI singles to help the A’s avoid a three-game sweep by their Bay Area rivals.	Oakland went 4-6 on its trip and fell out of first place in the AL West but picked up a game on Houston with its 16th win in June.	“We haven’t played our best recently but all that’s made (about) the Bay Bridge rivalry, there’s a little more to it and the last thing you want to do is be swept,” A’s manager Bob Melvin said. “I’m not saying it was the most important game in the world but our guys came out with some fire. They were a little upset last night that we lost that game.”	On Saturday the A’s led in extra innings but couldn’t hold on and lost 6-5.	Things were much different on Sunday.	Oakland jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the first then rode the pitching of Cole and two relievers to beat San Francisco.	Irvin (6-7) allowed three hits, walked two and matched the longest start of his career after making a slight adjustment in his delivery. The lefty retired 12 of the first 13 batters and allowed one runner to reach second base.	“I was really working on getting further down the mound, about a half-foot length,” Irvin said. “It really showed up today. I was able to stay on top of the ball a lot more, the ball was coming out of my hand later. Just feeling that I could command the ball and the ball was coming out later than it normally does, it gave me a sense of confidence.”	Irvin also laid down a perfectly executed squeeze bunt during the A’s three-run sixth.	“I definitely wanted that RBI,” Irvin said. “If I wasn’t bunting for it I was going to be swinging for the fences for it, that’s for sure.”	Deolis Guerra retired two batters and allowed two runs. Lou Trivino struck out Brandon Crawford to end it.	Buster Posey and Darin Ruf had two hits apiece for the Giants. San Francisco entered the day with the best record in the majors but missed a chance to move 25 games over .500 for the first time since 2012.	The Giants were on the verge of being shut out for the third time in 15 games before scoring twice in the ninth.	“It was good to have the crowd on their feet at the end,” San Francisco manager Gabe Kapler said. “We are better than we showed in the first couple of innings, but also Cole Irvin deserves a lot of credit for pitching a great game.”	Chapman’s two-run single off starter Sammy Long (1-1) in the first extended his hitting streak to a career-best 15 games. It followed consecutive hits and a double steal by Elvis Andrus and Matt Olson.	After Chad Pinder was hit by a pitch leading off the sixth and Tony Kemp walked, García singled to right off reliever John Brebbia to drive in Pinder. Irvin’s squeeze bunt scored Kemp, who beat the throw to home with a headfirst slide. Andrus’ sacrifice fly made it 5-0.	Long allowed four hits and four runs in five innings in his second career start.	“The first inning I left a few pitches up there when I was ahead in the count that I wanted down,” Long said. “Left some good pitches over the plate for them to hit.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Athletics: RHP J.B. Wendelken pitched two innings for Triple-A Las Vegas on Saturday and could rejoin the A’s soon.	Giants: 1B Brandon Belt is seeking additional opinions on his right knee injury. Kapler declined to say whether Belt would require season-ending surgery. ... RHP Logan Webb threw 20 pitches in a simulated inning before the game and could begin a rehab assignment soon. Webb has been out since June 3 because of a right shoulder strain.	UP NEXT	Athletics: Following an off day, RHP James Kaprielian (4-1, 2.86 ERA) faces the Texas Rangers on Tuesday. Kaprielian has allowed five hits or fewer in each of his eight starts.	Giants: RHP Anthony DeSclafani (8-2, 2.77) pitches against the Dodgers and RHP Trevor Bauer (7-5, 2.57) in the opener of a two-game series at Los Angeles on Monday. DeSclafani has won his last four starts while allowing three earned runs over 27 innings.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.
