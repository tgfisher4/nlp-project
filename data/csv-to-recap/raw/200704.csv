Red Sox 14, Mariners 3	BOSTON (AP) -- The Red Sox welcomed the Seattle Mariners to Boston with a whole different kind of storm.	Pelting World Series star Jeff Weaver with seven runs in the first two innings, Boston celebrated its home opener with a 14-3 victory on Tuesday in the Mariners' first game since a blizzard snowed them out of four straight in Cleveland.	"They were put in a tough situation for the last four days," Red Sox manager Terry Francona said. "We had an advantage, and we took advantage. Hopefully that will work for a couple days."	Jason Varitek and Kevin Youkilis each had three of Boston's 14 hits, and J.D. Drew homered in his first game for Boston at Fenway Park. Josh Beckett (2-0) pitched seven innings of two-hit ball, striking out eight and allowing one run while retiring his last 15 batters.	Boston also hit seven doubles and drew seven walks.	"We pulled out the whupping sticks today," Beckett said. "They've been off for a while. It maybe affected their pitchers being able to throw strikes. You can't go through our order and walk guys. You're going to get burned."	Weaver (0-1) was dismal in his first outing since pitching eight innings of four-hit ball in the final game of the St. Louis Cardinals' World Series victory over the Detroit Tigers. He allowed seven runs, seven hits and two walks, throwing 70 pitches in two innings.	The Mariners also helped out with errors by left fielder Raul Ibanez and shortstop Yuniesky Betancourt while managing just two runners against Beckett.	"Yeah, we played like we hadn't played in four days today," Mariners manager Mike Hargrove said. "We pitched like it. We swung the bats like it. We played defense like it. We should be better tomorrow."	It doesn't get any easier for the Mariners: Daisuke Matsuzaka makes his Fenway debut on Wednesday night in a game Red Sox fans have been anticipating since the team committed $103 million for the Japanese ace in the offseason.	"When I look out into the field, I see a huge sign of Dunkin Donuts that's in Japanese," Seattle's Ichiro Suzuki said. "Just by looking at that, I can tell that it's something big."	Beckett fanned Suzuki in all three at-bats on Tuesday -- just the second pitcher ever to do that following Tim Hudson on Sept. 19, 2003, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.	"It's hard to see Ichiro fan once," Hargrove said. "He's human. He's awfully good, but he's human."	The only life the Mariners showed after their long layoff was when Jose Guillen gave reliever Brendan Donnelly a menacing stare after striking out at the start of the eighth. The two have a history dating to 2005, when they both played for the Los Angeles Angels and Guillen was suspended for a clubhouse tantrum.	Guillen was ejected and the benches cleared, but no punches were thrown. Donnelly hit the next batter, Kenji Johjima, and was ejected.	The Red Sox trotted out the usual Opening Day fare, hanging bunting from the upper decks and bringing in Harry Connick Jr. to sing "America the Beautiful." They also honored the 1967 "Impossible Dream" team that won the AL pennant, bringing them out from behind a giant U.S. flag covering the Green Monster as Robert Goulet sang "The Impossible Dream."	Weaver put the first four runners of the game on base and then allowed a sacrifice fly to Drew and a two-run double to Coco Crisp. In the second, Julio Lugo and Youkilis doubled before Drew lined the ball to center for a two-run shot that gave Boston a 7-0 lead.	Game notes	The Mariners made their much-delayed road debut. ... Lugo reached safely on all four trips to the plate. ... Only five of the 23 batters Beckett faced hit the ball out of the infield. ... The 14 runs by the Red Sox were the second-most they'd ever scored in a home opener behind a 15-5 victory over the New York Yankees in 1973. ... The Red Sox have scored in the first inning in six of seven games.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

Astros 4, Cubs 2	CHICAGO (AP) -- Houston's Chris Sampson needed only 64 pitches	for five shutout innings against the Chicago Cubs, who seem to be	numbed by the cold -- at the plate and in the field.	If Sampson's calf muscle hadn't tightened up while he was	running the bases, he could have pitched a little longer on another	windy day at Wrigley Field.	"Believe me I didn't want to come out of the game, but for the	long run it was the best decision," Sampson said after the Astros'	4-2 win. "It's fine. Pitching, walking, all that doesn't bother	it. When I try to run on it that's when it starts getting pretty	sore."	Sampson (1-0) allowed three singles in his fourth major league	start, his first this season, and the Astros beat the Cubs for a	second straight day. The game featured three errors by Chicago	shortstop Cesar Izturis, a former Gold Glove winner.	"It was tough today. It's part of the game, errors," Izturis	said. "You have to forget about today and come back tomorrow with	a new mind."	Getting a boost when the Astros scored three in the first	inning, Sampson extended his scoreless streak against the Cubs to	12 innings dating to last season, giving up six hits.	And the starter's role seems to suit him. In his first four	major league starts, Sampson is 2-1 and has allowed just one earned	run in 19 2/3 innings.	"Sampson did a nice job of making good pitches and our hitters	put some runs on the board early," Astros manager Phil Garner	said. "They're talking about Chicago's offense hasn't broken out.	Well, our offense hasn't broken out, either."	Blanked on three hits through eight innings by Sampson, Rick White and Chad Qualls, the Cubs scored two runs in the ninth with	four hits off Dan Wheeler. Derrek Lee and Mark DeRosa had RBI	singles before pinch-hitter Matt Murton's game-ending popout with	two on.	Even before the loss, which dropped the Cubs to 3-5, Chicago	manager Lou Piniella predicted the team would play better once the	weather warms. It was 47 degrees Tuesday.	"I was telling our general manager today, the way we're put	together as a team, if we play in 40-degree [weather] all year, I	don't think we're going to do very well because we don't have that	type of team," Piniella said. "We have more power in our lineup.	We need to bang it a little more, and once the weather warms up, we	will."	After the game, Piniella wanted to make sure his comments	weren't misinterpreted. He said the Cubs are more a fly-ball team	than a small-ball group but still should be able to win	cold-weather games.	In their first two games at home, the Cubs have managed five	runs.	"We got to play in cold weather the same way the other team	does, and we got to win our share of ballgames in cold weather, the	same way the other team does," Piniella said.	"Look, it's not the easiest thing in the world to swing a bat	in cold weather," he said. "If you gave me my preference, hitting	in 40-degree weather and hitting in 80-degree weather, I'm going to	take 80-degree weather all the time. I know it's a tough thing to	do, believe me. At same time, you have to be selective and got to	make the other pitcher pitch, and I think that's what we did in the	ninth."	Houston bunched four straight hits in the first inning to take a	3-0 lead against Jason Marquis (0-1). In his first start for the	Cubs at Wrigley Field, Marquis allowed four runs, four hits and	four walks in five innings. He is 1-4 in the Cubs' home park.	On a day with the wind blowing in at 15 mph, Morgan Ensberg	doubled with one out, Lance Berkman singled, Carlos Lee hit an RBI	single and Luke Scott followed with a two-run double that went over	Alfonso Soriano in center when the new Cubs star appeared to	initially misjudge the ball.	"When I hit it, I saw him, he just kind of froze. The ball was	hit right at him," Scott said. "It had a little backspin and	fortunately it was able to go over his head."	Izturis, who won a Gold Glove in 2004 with the Dodgers, made	back-to-back errors in the fourth. He made a low throw on Chris	Burke's grounder, then dropped Marquis' throw at the bag on an	attempt to start a double play.	In the fifth, Izturis fumbled Craig Biggio's leadoff grounder	for his third error. Izturis made six errors in 54 games with Los	Angeles and the Cubs last season.	After the third error, Marquis loaded the bases with walks to	Berkman and Carlos Lee, and Scott hit an RBI bouncer that made it	4-0.	Game Notes	In his first major league start last June, Sampson got his	first major league win by shutting out the Cubs on three hits for	seven innings. ... White was like a goalie in the seventh. He took	a line drive off his stomach, picked up the ball and threw Michael	Barrett out at first. He then grabbed DeRosa's liner to end the	inning.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

Tigers 3, Orioles 1	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Nate Robertson was throwing brilliantly, yet he	was locked in a scoreless game when Baltimore Orioles starter Jaret	Wright walked off the mound with an ominous shoulder injury.	Minutes later, a throwing error by Brian Roberts provided the	Detroit Tigers with all the runs they needed Tuesday night in a 3-1	victory.	Robertson (2-0) allowed no runs and four hits, struck out five	and walked one in 7 1/3 innings. The left-hander is 2-0 with a 1.35	ERA in four starts against Baltimore dating to last season.	"He just mixes pitches well. He had a good sinker, a good	slider and mixed in some changes," Detroit manager Jim Leyland	said. "He's a bulldog, you know, and he's a real tough	competitor."	In the pivotal sixth inning, Wright (0-2) gave up an infield hit	and a walk before summoning Orioles trainer Brian Ebel from the	dugout. After a brief discussion, Wright left with stiffness in his	right shoulder.	Wright said he began to feel stiffness when he started throwing	in the fifth inning. Because he has a history of shoulder problems,	Wright knew it wouldn't be prudent to test his arm any further on a	chilly night at Camden Yards.	"I know if I kept going that I could probably really hurt it. I	just want to give myself a chance to let the doctors work on it and	see what they can do with it," he said. "If it was routine	soreness, I would still be out there throwing. It just kept getting	tighter, and I didn't want to keep pushing it."	Wright said that kind of tightness is consistent with the	feeling he's had in the past when experiencing shoulder problems.	The right-hander spent half the 2005 season on the disabled list	with a right shoulder strain and missed much of the 2002 season	with the same ailment.	Obtained by the Orioles in an offseason trade with the New York	Yankees, Wright came in with a 15.43 ERA after getting rocked by	Minnesota last week in his Baltimore debut. He issued five walks in	2 1/3 innings against the Twins, but he did not walk a Detroit	batter until the sixth.	Orioles manager Sam Perlozzo replaced Wright with Scott	Williamson, who had not pitched since opening day in part because	he was dealing with the aftereffects of a bout with bronchitis.	Placido Polanco reached when no one fielded his attempted	sacrifice bunt down the third-base line. That loaded the bases for	Gary Sheffield, who extended his hitless run to 11 at-bats by	striking out. Magglio Ordonez followed by hitting a potential	double-play grounder to shortstop Miguel Tejada.	Tejada flipped the ball to Roberts at second base for the force	out, but Roberts' relay throw skipped past first baseman Kevin	Millar and into the seats, allowing two runs to score.	"I threw a ball in the dirt at the wrong time. It's part of the	game, unfortunately," Roberts said. "I'd like to do it an 8-0	game, but it's one of those things."	Leyland said, "Polanco did a good job of getting down there on	the double-play ball and got up on [Roberts] and made it a real	nasty play for him. We got a break there."	Roberts wouldn't use that as an excuse.	"You always have a runner coming down on you. Every now and	then you get a guy that bails off, but it's part of the game. I've	done it a million times," he said.	In the eighth, Curtis Granderson hit a leadoff double off Jeremy	Guthrie, advanced on a wild pitch and scored on a sacrifice fly by	Polanco.	Joel Zumaya gave up a home run to Corey Patterson in the eighth	and Todd Jones worked a perfect ninth for his fourth save.	The Orioles, meanwhile, had few scoring opportunities against	Robertson. Baltimore wasted a leadoff double by Millar in the third	inning, then got two on with one out in the fourth before Tejada --	who came in batting .385 lifetime against Robertson -- hit into a	1-4-3 double play.	"That could have been the turning point of the game. It's too	early in the game to look back and say much about it then, but it	was big," Robertson said. "We got the ground ball and the double	play to get out of there. But that's where you can make a manager	antsy."	Game notes	Tigers 3B Brandon Inge, who's 0-for-20 this season, wasn't	in the starting lineup. He entered in the seventh as a defensive	replacement. ... Granderson hit two doubles and has an extra-base	hit in five of seven games. ... Patterson's first homer enabled the	Orioles to avoid their first shutout.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

And given the events of the past week, he's pretty sure of one	thing.	"We brought it with us," Wedge said.	No, this wasn't Jacobs Field. But considering the foot of snow that blanketed the Indians stadium over the weekend, a dumping the team is using flatbed trucks to remove, this wasn't all that bad, writes Wayne Drehs. Story	After sitting through a weekend's worth of snow in Cleveland	without playing a game that counted, the Indians finally got to	play a home opener of sorts, beating the Los Angeles Angels 7-6	Tuesday night under the retractable roof at Milwaukee's Miller Park	-- some 450 miles away from Jacobs Field.	Talk about a getaway day.	Cleveland's three-game series against the Angels was moved to	Milwaukee after a spring snowstorm wiped out four scheduled games	against the Seattle Mariners.	Indians players were concerned about being rusty after the	layoff, but Cleveland starter C.C. Sabathia was anything but.	Despite not having pitched since opening day, Sabathia (2-0) gave	up three runs -- one earned -- and struck out seven in seven innings.	"It wasn't that weird," Sabathia said. "We were playing a	home game somewhere else."	The Cleveland bullpen did look a little rusty. Reliever Roberto	Hernandez loaded the bases in the eighth, and Aaron Fultz gave up a	two-run single to Maicer Izturis that cut the Indians' lead to 7-5.	Joe Borowski pitched the ninth for his second save, but not	before allowing an RBI single by Casey Kotchman.	The game ended when pinch-runner Erick Aybar was thrown out by	catcher Kelly Shoppach -- the second time in five games that Aybar,	representing the tying run, was thrown out for the last out of the	game trying to steal second. Aybar also was erased against Oakland	on Thursday.	Angels manager Mike Scioscia said he left the decision to steal	up to Aybar on both plays.	"But I wouldn't have given him the option if we didn't have a	good chance to be successful," Scioscia said.	Angels starter Ervin Santana (1-1) gave up six runs and seven	hits in 4 1/3 innings for the loss.	"Next outing's going to be better," Santana said. "The ball	goes out of here pretty fast."	The game was a victory for the Brewers, who priced seats for all	three games at $10 each and were pleasantly surprised at the	response -- an announced crowd of 19,031 who showed up to politely	root, root, root for their adopted home team.	The Indians brought their mascot, Slider, and paid for superfan	John Adams to bring his big drum -- a fixture at Indians home games	-- to Milwaukee.	"I think it's great," Adams said. "They started a little too	early. I know a lot of people from Cleveland [who] live in Chicago	came racing up after work."	But Tuesday's game had a touch of Milwaukee, as the chorizo won	the sausage mascot race that was held after the sixth inning, just	like during Brewers games.	And fans seemed too busy doing the wave in the seventh inning to	notice that Sabathia had struck out Garret Anderson to pitch out of	a jam. Even Wedge admitted he was temporarily mesmerized by what	amounted to a changeup wave by the fans, done at half its normal	speed.	"I've never seen a slow wave before," Wedge said. "That	locked me up a little bit."	Had the Indians actually played at home on Tuesday, they planned	to give away replicas of the thick black eyeglasses worn by Charlie	Sheen's character in the 1989 baseball comedy "Major League" to	promote the release of a special edition DVD.	In some respects, Tuesday became a live-action version of the	movie, in which the Brewers' old Milwaukee County Stadium stood in	as the stunt double for Cleveland's former ballpark, Municipal	Stadium.	"We were talking this morning about the irony of being in	Milwaukee," Adams said. "It's incredible. I was in County	Stadium, it looked very similar to old Cleveland Municipal."	But it wasn't quite the same without Bob Uecker, who was in	Florida for his real-life job as the Brewers' radio announcer and	unable to reprise his role as Harry Doyle, the Indians' fictional	television announcer in the movie.	And to co-opt a Doyle catch phrase, Tuesday's game was just a	bit inside -- and as far as the players were concerned, playing	indoors was just fine.	"I'd rather be here than out in the snow," Kendrick said.	Notes	 Indians LHP Cliff Lee, who has a strained abdominal muscle,	gave up one hit in two innings in a rehab outing for Class A	Kinston. ... C Victor Martinez, who has a strained left quadriceps,	might return this weekend. Martinez did not travel with the team	after his wife gave birth to a baby girl Tuesday morning. ...	Angels RHP Bartolo Colon, who is recovering from a torn right	rotator cuff, was scheduled to make a rehab start for Class A	Rancho Cucamonga on Tuesday night.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

Cardinals 3, Pirates 2	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Once the St. Louis Cardinals finally put some runners on, they were able to do something on the bases. Namely, run themselves into a victory in a game they easily could have lost.	Much like they did numerous times a season ago en route to winning the World Series.	Gary Bennett successfully gambled by running on a short fly ball to score the winning run in the 12th inning and the Cardinals rallied from two runs down in the ninth to beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 3-2 on Tuesday night.	Bennett singled and Aaron Miles doubled with one out in the 12th against John Wasdin (0-1), the fifth Pirates pitcher. Yadier Molina was intentionally walked to load the bases and set up the double-play opportunity. But Skip Schumaker lifted a fly ball to left fielder Jason Bay, whose throw to the plate beat Bennett only to have catcher Ronny Paulino drop the ball.	"We were taking a chance, but we got a nice hop on Bay's throw that gives it just that little extra," manager Tony La Russa said, commending third base coach Jose Oquendo's decision to send the runner. "Guys in the dugout are yelling, 'Send him, send him.' You're better off making the third out at the plate rather than putting it on David [Eckstein] to get a two-out hit."	Schumaker was credited with a sacrifice fly, even though it appeared Bennett would have been out if Paulino held onto the ball.	"It was a bang-bang play," Paulino said. "I had the ball for a second. But when I went to tag him, I dropped it. I never got a chance to grab it."	A similar baserunning play in the ninth helped the Cardinals tie it after they went into the inning trailing 2-0.	After Eckstein singled and Chris Duncan walked against Pirates closer Salomon Torres, Albert Pujols missed a home run by several feet on a long fly ball that Bay tracked down several feet from the wall. The drive was deep enough that both runners tagged up, allowing last-minute lineup replacement Scott Spiezio to tie it with a two-run single to right.	La Russa praised Eckstein and Duncan for being aggressive and moving up on the play.	Spiezio, who didn't play Monday because of food poisoning, started only because Scott Rolen was held out with back spasms. Rolen, who had five RBIs in his last two games, had been in the Cardinals' lineup until a few minutes before game time.	"Put a special gold star next to his name," La Russa said of Spiezio. "He was not going to play in this game, in an emergency only, he gutted it up and he ended up playing 12 innings."	Spiezio was weak and tired when the game started and said it was a challenge to make it through the first few innings. By the end, he was glad he played.	"That was the way we were last year, come from behind and never give up," he said. "It was a great win for us."	And a tough loss for the Pirates, who wasted Gorzelanny's seven shutout innings. The left-hander, who stayed in the Pirates' rotation despite a miserable spring training in which his ERA was above 10.00 for most of March, struck out five, walked none and retired 12 of the final 13 batters he faced.	Gorzelanny wouldn't blame Torres for failing for the first time in five save situations this season.	"He's a great closer and he's going to be a great closer," Gorzelanny said. "A hundred times more, I'd put him in that situation."	Gorzelanny had to be sharp against Cardinals replacement starter Randy Keisler, who limited the Pirates to two runs over six innings in his first major-league start since 2005 with Cincinnati.	Keisler, a former Yankees farmhand, couldn't have been much better in replacing the injured Chris Carpenter until Jose Bautista hit a one-out homer in the fifth. The Pirates made it 2-0 on Sanchez's double and Bay's RBI single in the sixth.	"I'll take that," said Keisler, who retired 12 batters in a row at one point. "I'll take that any day."	Brad Thompson (1-0) pitched two scoreless innings for the victory before Jason Isringhausen came on for his third save in as many opportunities and second in as many days in Pittsburgh.
