DETROIT (AP) -- Justin Morneau narrowly missed one homer on Thursday afternoon.	He took advantage of a second chance.	Three innings after hitting a 425-foot double to the deepest part of Comerica Park, Morneau lined an 11th-inning homer off Freddy Dolsi (1-3) with one out into the right-field stands to give the Minnesota Twins a 7-6 win over the Detroit Tigers.	"I was looking for something to drive, and I just got enough of it," he said. "That was a pretty good feeling rounding the bases."	Morneau matched a career high with five hits, helping the Twins end a three-game losing streak.	"This was a big win," he said. "We were down a couple in the ninth, they made a mistake and we took advantage of it."	Minnesota has won 17 of 22 despite being swept at Fenway Park earlier in the week.	Matt Guerrier (5-4) pitched two innings for the victory, allowing Matt Joyce's two-out double in the 11th. Guerrier then struck out Clete Thomas, finishing the win.	Detroit, which had won its previous three games, was trying to move three games over .500 for the first time since its 24-36 start.	"This was a good win for us after three tough losses in Boston," Minnesota manager Ron Gardenhire said. "Even when we fell behind, we kept making good swings."	Morneau's extra-inning heroics were made possible by two key ninth-inning mistakes by Tigers rookie right fielder Joyce.	Joyce made a key error that helped the Twins overcome a 6-4 deficit in the top of the ninth, then couldn't get a bunt down in the bottom of the inning as the Tigers tried to avoid extra innings.	"This is definitely tough," Joyce said. "I made two big mistakes and they cost us the game."	Minnesota's ninth-inning rally came off Todd Jones, who failed to convert a save for just the second time in 18 chances. Nick Punto singled leading off the ninth and scored on a single by Denard Span that skipped past Matt Joyce in right field. Span, who finished 4-for-4, took third on the error and scored on Joe Mauer's pinch-hit sacrifice fly to tie the game.	"It just caught me between hops," Joyce said. "I looked up to see if Punto was going to third, and it got by me."	"The kid's trying to make a play -- it isn't like he intentionally kicked the ball around," Jones said. "But with a guy on third and no one out and Joe Mauer up, you're going to have to be lucky, and I didn't get lucky."	Twins closer Joe Nathan walked the first two batters in the bottom of the ninth, bringing Joyce to the plate. He missed two bunt attempts before striking out. After another walk loaded the bases, Nathan struck out Jeff Larish and Ivan Rodriguez to end the inning.	"We got what we wanted, but we couldn't put a ball in play and end the game," Tigers manager Jim Leyland said. "We couldn't get a fly ball."	The Twins blew an early 2-0 lead.	Brendan Harris started the third with a double off Kenny Rogers and scored on Span's one-out triple before Carlos Gomez made it 2-0 with an RBI groundout.	Rogers allowed three runs and nine hits in seven innings. He escaped a first-and-third, no-out jam in the fifth when Jeff Larish threw Punto out at the plate on Gomez's grounder, Span was caught stealing third and Alexi Casilla grounded out.	Twins starter Kevin Slowey gave up six runs and nine hits in 3 2-3 innings.	Curtis Granderson hit a run-scoring double in the bottom of the third and Detroit scored five runs in the fourth. Joyce's second homer in as many games started a stretch in which seven of eight batters got hits off Slowey. Ramon Santiago hit a two-run double.	"I kept the ball up and they hit it," Slowey said. "I just didn't make any adjustments at all."	Casilla's sacrifice fly made it 6-3 in the seventh, and Morneau made it a two-run game when he doubled and scored off Fernando Rodney in the eighth.	"We didn't add on after the early runs, but you still have to close out a three-run lead with six outs to go," Leyland said.	Game notes	 Morneau and Span combined to go 9-for-9 with four extra-base hits. ... Minnesota loaded the bases in the 10th, but Casilla grounded out to end the inning. ... Jeff Larish, called up from Triple-A Toledo before the game, went 3-for-5. ... The Tigers activated Brandon Inge from the disabled list, but he did not play. SS Edgar Renteria also sat out the game after straining his hamstring on Wednesday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Ryan Howard knows two ways to take the focus off his anemic average.	Go deep. Drive in runs.	"I can't control what people look at," Howard said.	Howard homered twice, drove in three runs and continued to inch his batting average toward a more respectable level, leading the Philadelphia Phillies to a 4-1 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals on Thursday.	"He does about twice as much as other guys do," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said.	Howard lined a two-run shot to left-center off Braden Looper (9-7) in the first and connected again in the sixth. He now leads the National League with 27 homers, two better than teammate Chase Utley, and 83 RBIs.	"I've been staying on it and trying to hit it wherever it's pitched," Howard said.	Howard was batting in the .160s in early May, was at .215 coming into this month and was upset after hearing some mild boos from the finicky fans. But the former MVP is hitting .353 (18-for-51) with eight homers and 18 RBIs over a 13-game hitting streak that's lifted his average to .234. He's heard nothing but wild cheers after every deep home run.	"There's been a lot of adversity," Howard said. "It's always a grind."	While he still leads the league in strikeouts, Manuel said he could live with all the whiffs as long as Howard produces runs and hits in big moments. He hit the tiebreaking homer in the eighth inning of Wednesday night's 4-2 victory and set a team record for most RBIs before the All-Star break.	"Find somebody that's produced more runs than him," Manuel said. "I think that's kind of hard to do. Who tops that? What's the name of the game? To produce runs."	Howard's homers were enough run support for 45-year-old Jamie Moyer (8-6), who won for the first time since June 12.	Ryan Madson followed Moyer with 1 1-3 scoreless innings. Manuel gave closer Brad Lidge the game off, leaving J.C. Romero to get two outs for his first save in five chances.	Moyer slumped in his last four starts, going 0-3 with a 4.13 ERA. But he struck out four in this one and was never in any real serious trouble over seven solid innings. Yadier Molina's RBI single in the fourth was the only run scored off the veteran left-hander.	Moyer knows two numbers are usually connected to him: his age, and the speed of his fastball. He hit the low 80s in this one, relying on his command and groundballs to bail him out of jams.	"The thing I can look at is that I'm still doing it," Moyer said. "I'm proud of that."	The NL East-leading Phillies staked Moyer to a 3-0 lead in the third on Utley's RBI double down the first-base line. Utley came close to tying Howard in the fifth for the home run lead, but his drive fell short on the warning track.	"We put a whopping four on them again," Manuel cracked. "That was enough though."	Looper allowed four runs and seven hits in six innings.	"He made some good pitches and some that weren't so good," manager Tony La Russa said.	Game notes	 The Phillies sent LHP J.A. Happ to Triple-A Lehigh Valley. Happ started Wednesday night's game, but was not needed to pitch again before the All-Star break. The Phillies purchased the contract of INF Mike Cervenak from Lehigh Valley. Happ might not return after the break if the Phillies believe RHP Brett Myers is set to return to the rotation. Myers, their opening-day starter, pitches for Double-A Reading on Saturday and likely will make at least more minor league start after that. ... The Cardinals placed LHP Mark Mulder on the disabled list, one day after he left his comeback start after facing only three batters. They purchased the contract of LHP Jamie Garcia from Triple-A Memphis. ... Gregg Dobbs' pinch single in the seventh gave him 18 already this season -- the most on the Phillies since Dave Philley had 18 in 1958.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

NEW YORK (AP) -- Fernando Tatis turned this into an extra special win for the New York Mets.	Almost left behind on baseball's scrap heap, the resurgent Tatis homered, doubled twice and drove in four runs as the Mets beat the San Francisco Giants 7-3 Thursday for their sixth straight victory.	"It's amazing," Tatis said.	Best known as the only major leaguer to hit two grand slams in a single inning, Tatis delivered the first three extra-base hit performance of his career, the Elias Sports Bureau said.	Tatis' tiebreaking home run in the seventh inning was timely, too. After the game, the Mets said outfielder Moises Alou had torn his left hamstring and likely was done for the year.	"It's a good day for Fernando Tatis to have a good day," general manager Omar Minaya said.	The Mets' winning streak is their longest since a seven-game string in August 2006. Tatis also contributed in a big way Sunday with a two-run homer in the 12th inning that beat Philadelphia.	Out of the majors since 2006, Tatis was a late arrival in spring training. When he got promoted from the minors in mid-May, the Mets regarded him as a utilityman and possible pinch-hitter.	But the 33-year-old Tatis has proven to be a valuable bat, an adequate fielder and someone who runs well. And with the Mets minus Alou and Ryan Church in the outfield, Tatis could stop the merry-go-round.	"I don't want to think about taking anyone's job," Tatis said. "Whenever they put me out there, I'll play hard."	David Wright doubled twice, and scored the go-ahead run in a four-run seventh inning. It was his last bid to earn the final spot on the NL All-Star team -- Internet balloting closed shortly after the game.	Despite the public-address announcer at Shea Stadium frequently urging fans to text in their votes for Wright, Milwaukee outfielder Corey Hart won the spot.	The Giants ended their scoreless streak at 21 innings, but still lost their fourth in a row. They were held to three hits in each of the three losses to the Mets.	"We just got outplayed. We got outhit, we didn't play well on defense," manager Bruce Bochy said. "It was probably our worst series of the year. The Mets, they're playing well right now. They're a hot team. We're not playing well. That's why we got swept."	Scott Schoeneweis (1-2) won in relief of John Maine.	Tatis hit his fourth homer, a two-run drive into the left-field bleachers off Sergio Romo (0-1) in the seventh.	The Mets added two more in the inning on a throwing error by third baseman Jose Castillo and a single by Jose Reyes.	Tatis had gotten just 56 at-bats in the majors since 2003 when he joined the Mets. His big year was long ago, in 1999 when he hit those two slams off Chan Ho Park and finished that season with 34 homers and 107 RBIs for St. Louis.	With the homer, Tatis raised his average over .300. The crowd chanted his name when he came up again in the eighth inning.	"It's an inspiration to the whole team," Mets manager Jerry Manuel said.	Shut out by the Mets the previous two nights, the Giants scored in the fourth when John Bowker doubled and later raced home on Maine's wild pitch.	A righty, Maine exited his last start because of a cramp in his left forearm. Against the Giants, he matched season highs by striking out eight and walking five -- Maine faced 21 batters and went to a full count on 10 of them.	Ahead 3-1 with two outs in the fifth, Maine lost a chance at a win because of Randy Winn. After Winn lined a tying double for just the Giants' second hit, Manuel pulled Maine.	Tatis' second double of the game drove in two runs and put the Mets ahead 3-0 in the third against Barry Zito. Carlos Beltran hit an RBI single, then ran right through third base coach Luis Aguayo's stop and easily scored when the throw home was cut off.	Tatis made a nice running catch on Castillo's fly toward the right-field corner in the sixth and finished the game playing left.	Game notes	 Zito got a no-decision and avoided becoming the first pitcher to lose 13 times before the All-Star break since Detroit's Jeremy Bonderman and Mike Maroth in 2003. Denny McLain holds the major league record for losses by the All-Star break with 15 in 1971. ... Maine drew a walk from Zito in the fourth. The next inning, Zito drew a walk from Maine and scored his first run of the year.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MILWAUKEE (AP) -- When Dave Bush takes the mound on the road for the Milwaukee Brewers the results often are brutal.	It's exactly the opposite when he pitches at Miller Park.	Bush had a career-high 13 strikeouts, Corey Hart celebrated making the All-Star team with his 15th homer and the Brewers beat the Colorado Rockies 11-1 on Thursday.	"That's as good as it gets," Milwaukee manager Ned Yost said.	Bush (5-8) allowed one run and four hits over eight innings, improving to 4-2 with a 2.64 ERA at home. He retired 23 of his final 24 batters after allowing a first-inning run.	Hart connected in the seventh to make it 8-1 and was told by Yost as he walked into the Miller Park interview room with his two young children that he beat out four other players in Internet balloting for the final spot on the NL All-Star team. A couple minutes into his news conference, about a dozen of his teammates rushed into the room and sprayed Hart and his children with beer, loudly cheering the news.	Hart said it was difficult concentrating on playing during the vote.	"It was a frustrating experience, but it paid off with all the campaigning," he said. "Now, it's worth it."	Bush's strong home record and 6.94 road ERA is such a dramatic difference that Yost is considering using the right-hander as the team's fifth starter at Miller Park and right-hander Seth McClung as the fifth starter on the road when injured Jeff Suppan returns to the rotation after the All-Star break.	"I've always been better at home throughout my career, for whatever the reason," Bush said. "I wish I knew the answer. I'd take it on the road with me."	Jorge De La Rosa (3-5) allowed seven runs in just 3 2/3 innings for Colorado. The left-hander gave up nine hits and dropped to 0-4 on the road.	Milwaukee pushed across six runs in the fourth to take a 7-1 lead. All-Star Ryan Braun had a two-run single and Prince Fielder added a two-run triple.	"He gets that one inning that unravels on him and he's not been able to stop it," Colorado manager Clint Hurdle said. "His mechanics fall out of line."	J.J. Hardy also hit a two-run homer in the eighth for Milwaukee, his 13th of the season.	Clint Barmes had an RBI single in the first but Bush quickly settled down.	The Rockies got a leadoff single from Matt Holliday in the fourth, but Bush retired 14 consecutive batters before giving up a two-out double to Jayson Nix in the eighth. Carlos Villanueva pitched the ninth for Milwaukee.	Game notes	 The Brewers are 21-9 when facing a left-handed starter. ... Holliday was named a starter for the NL All-Star team, replacing injured Chicago Cubs OF Alfonso Soriano. Holliday's fourth-inning single extended his hitting streak to 14 games. ... The Brewers have hit at least one home run in 10 consecutive games. ... Bush's fifth-inning strikeout of Luis Vizcaino was the 500th of his career.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CHICAGO (AP) -- David Ross and the Cincinnati Reds felt right at home with the wind blowing out of Wrigley Field on Thursday.	The Chicago Cubs' friendly confines was even nicer to a visiting team, for once.	Ross hit two of Cincinnati's seven homers, a long-ball barrage that included Ken Griffey Jr.'s 605th, and the Reds avoided a sweep with a 12-7 victory.	It was only Chicago's 11th home loss this season.	"It was a hot and humid day and I've seen that ball travel here on these kind of days big time. Anything that was up in the air, you were always nervous," said Reds manager Dusty Baker, who skippered the Cubs for four years and knows all about wild games at the neighborhood park.	"That was big for the offense to break out like that and keep scoring. In this ballpark you're never comfortable. I don't care what the lead is, especially with the offense that they have over there."	Edwin Encarnacion, Brandon Phillips, Adam Dunn and Joey Votto also homered with the wind blowing out at 12 mph on a muggy day. The Reds tied their season high for homers -- they also had seven against the Cubs at their longball-friendly yard, Great American Ball Park, on May 7.	Backup catcher Ross had one homer all season before hitting solo shots in the fifth off Jon Lieber and seventh off newly acquired Chad Gaudin.	"I had a chance to play today and made the most of it," Ross said. "I think everybody wants to hit when the wind is blowing out here."	Griffey hit a three-run drive off reliever Michael Wuertz as Cincinnati scored four times in the fourth to take an 8-3 lead. He also had a run-scoring double and finished with four RBIs	"We were just trying to get base hits. Sometimes you get the ball in the air and it can go out," Griffey said. "The wind was blowing out."	Griffey's 12th homer of the season got him within four of tying Sammy Sosa for fifth on the career list with 609.	The Reds chased Ted Lilly (9-6) after 2 2/3 innings, his shortest outing of the season. The left-hander gave up six hits and four runs before he was removed by manager Lou Piniella.	"An ugly inning," Lilly said of the third. "I understand why Lou wanted to go in a different direction."	Mike Fontenot homered for Chicago, which dropped to 35-11 at home.	All-Star outfielder Kosuke Fukudome fouled a ball off his leg in the eighth and was replaced in the field in the ninth. Fukudome said he was OK but playing every day could be wearing on the Cubs' first-year player.	He struck out three times and went 0-for-5 as his average dropped to .282.	"It looks to me like he's swinging awfully tired," Piniella said.	Chicago cut it to 8-5 on Fontenot's two-run drive in the fourth but Ross went deep in the fifth and Dunn's long drive to right in the sixth cleared the stadium and landed on the other side of Sheffield Ave.	Piniella said he lost track of how many homers the Reds hit. "I know the one Dunn hit counted for two," he cracked.	Derrek Lee had an RBI double in the first and Ryan Theriot delivered a two-out, two-run single in the second to help the Cubs build a 3-1 lead.	Game notes	  Cincinnati finished with 18 hits. ... It was Ross' eighth career multihomer game. ... RHP Rich Harden, acquired by the Cubs on Tuesday from Oakland, threw a light bullpen session on Thursday. Harden could be on a pitch limit of about 100 when he makes his Cubs' debut on Saturday against the Giants. ... Baker said the team likely will recall RHP Homer Bailey from Triple-A Louisville to start on Sunday in place of Aaron Harang, who had an MRI on Thursday that came back normal. It showed he has a strained right forearm. ... INF Jolbert Cabrera (dislocated left index finger), currently on a minor league rehab assignment, is expected to return to the Reds shortly after the All-Star break. ... In the bottom of the second, Lilly's line drive foul ball struck a youngster sitting in the seats about 20 rows behind the Cubs' dugout on the third base side. The youngster was carried out of the stands. A first aid employee said the youngster was taken to the hospital and appeared to be OK. Lilly said he was unaware the kid had been struck.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Emil Brown rounded the bases, then grabbed A's hitting coach Ty Van Burkleo and nearly smothered him in a hug -- a good student acknowledging his teacher.	Brown hit a solo homer in the 11th inning, after Jack Cust and Kurt Suzuki hit solo shots in the ninth inning to tie the game, and Oakland rallied for a 3-2 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Thursdsay.	Brown's first career game-winning home run also gave Caesar Jimenez (0-1) his first career decision, after Huston Street (2-2) pitched two scoreless innings for the Athletics.	"I swung the bat, but Ty got me better prepared for that at-bat than any before," Brown said. "He told me exactly what the guy would do and I kept that in the back of my mind like a game plan. He did exactly what Ty told me he would."	Cust led off the ninth with his 17th home run, and second in as many games, off Brandon Morrow. The Mariners' new closer came back to strike out Brown and Carlos Gonzalez, but Suzuki hit his first career pinch-hit homer on a 1-0 delivery to send the game to extra innings.	"I got myself loose just in case I would pinch hit," Suzuki said. "It's not easy to pinch hit against a guy who throws 100 miles an hour. You wait for the fastball and if you get one for a strike, you better not miss it."	It was Morrow's first career blown save and spoiled a stellar performance by R.A. Dickey, who gave up four hits over seven scoreless innings.	"It took me a moment to adjust," Dickey said of working out of a bases-loaded jam in the first. "The bullpen mound is in the opposite direction of the game mound and that makes a big difference for a knuckleballer. It took me an inning to get used to it."	A's starter Greg Smith allowed four hits over six innings, but his offense failed to support him with a run for the seventh time -- and with two or fewer for the 12th time in 18 starts.	"He's pitched great for us all year," Cust said. "It seems like he's always on the short end of a pitcher's duel. He's doing everything he can to keep us in it and the best thing is that we won the game."	Brad Ziegler worked an inning of relief for Oakland, extending his scoreless inning streak to 19 to start his career. He's three shy of Boston's Dave Ferriss for the American League record set in 1945.	The Mariners loaded the bases in the seventh and didn't get any runs, before finally cracking the scoreboard in the eighth.	"You hate to keep saying we're playing great baseball and all that stuff and still losing but we're not cashing in on our opportunities," Mariners manager Jim Riggleman said. "The bottom line is we didn't get enough hits or timely hits."	Jose Lopez doubled leading off and went to third on Raul Ibanez's deep fly to right. After Adrian Beltre was intentionally walked, Jose Vidro dribbled a grounder up the middle that was flagged down by Mark Ellis. The throw to first was too late, allowing Lopez to score.	Seattle added another run in the ninth, when Willie Bloomquist hit a one-out double and stole third. Lopez followed with a double to deep left field that made it 2-0.	"We've been playing better baseball for the last month," Bloomquist said. "If our pitchers keep doing what they've been doing, we're going to win more than we lose. If they do what they've been doing, I like our chances."	Ailing A's outfielder Ryan Sweeney had two hits before leaving the game with a dislocated left pinkie following a stolen base attempt in the bottom of the third.	He's already missed time with a left toe injury and a sprained left ankle, but was batting .351 with six multi-hit games over his last 10 since returning to the lineup.	He was replaced by Rajai Davis in the outfield.	Game notes	 The Mariners placed 1B Richie Sexson on waivers for the purpose of giving him his unconditional release. ... Mariners' LHP Erik Bedard went on the disabled list with stiffness in his left shoulder retroactive to July 5. ... The Mariners recalled RHP Jared Wells and selected IF Tug Hulett from Tacoma of the PCL. ... Smith matched Kenny Rogers for the most pickoffs in a season (10) by an Oakland pitcher since 1987 after catching Miguel Cairo in the fifth. ... RHP Sean Gallagher makes his A's debut against the Los Angeles Angels on Friday, becoming the 10th rookie (fifth rookie pitcher) to play for the A's. ... Morrow has allowed four runs this year, all on solo homers. ... Suzuki's pinch hit home run was the first for the A's since Adam Melhuse delivered against the Boston Red Sox on Aug. 28, 2006. That had been the longest drought in the majors.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Indians snapped out of one of the worst losing streaks in franchise history by beating a team that is suddenly trying to find answers of its own.	Ben Francisco had a career-high four RBIs and hit one of Cleveland's four home runs as the Indians snapped a 10-game losing streak with a 13-2 victory over Tampa Bay that extended the Rays' skid to four on Thursday night.	"It feels pretty good -- a lot better than what we had been doing. That stunk," said Casey Blake, who along with David Dellucci also homered and had three RBIs.	Cleveland last dropped 10 in a row in 1979 and avoided its longest streak in 77 years by overcoming a 2-0 deficit. The last time the Indians lost 11 straight was 1931, on the way to a team-record 12 consecutive losses.	Francisco and David Dellucci each hit two-run homers in a five-run fifth against Andy Sonnanstine (10-4). Blake hit a solo shot in a seven-run eighth off Gary Glover.	"This was huge for all of us," said Dellucci, adding that a rather fiery pregame talk to the team by manager Eric Wedge gave him inspiration.	"He got right to the point while showing his faith in us," Dellucci said. "Afterwards, we felt good about ourselves even though we know where we are in the standings."	Aaron Laffey (5-5) earned the last-place Indians' first win since recently traded CC Sabathia beat the Cincinnati Reds 6-0 on June 27. Laffey allowed two runs and four hits over six innings, winning for the first time in five starts since June 12.	"When we fell behind, it was like it was 10-0 and you felt it through the entire stadium," Laffey said. "But the guys came through against the best team in the big leagues."	Tampa Bay came in with baseball's best record (55-35), but lost for the 10th straight time in Cleveland. Tampa Bay last won at the Indians' home on Sept. 29, 2005, when Lou Piniella was manager. The Rays' 26-56 record overall against Cleveland is their worst against any opponent.	Kelly Shoppach got Cleveland going by poking a one-out single to right in the fifth. Dellucci, in a 7-for-47 (.149) slump, followed with his seventh homer -- and first since June 4.	"David gave us a shot of energy," Wedge said. "Then we had real good at-bats up and down the lineup."	Andy Marte then singled, went to third on a single by Grady Sizemore and scored on a fielder's choice grounder by Jamey Carroll to put Cleveland ahead. Francisco followed with his eighth homer.	Shin-Soo Choo led off the sixth with his third homer and Blake connected for his ninth in the eighth to make it 7-2. Francisco and Blake each had two-run singles later in the inning.	The Rays took a 2-0 lead in the third. Willy Aybar hit a leadoff single and Jonny Gomes drove his seventh homer of the season deep into the left-field bleachers. Gomes was in a 1-for-24 slump, with the only hit a pinch homer June 28 at Pittsburgh.	Sonnanstine gave up nine hits and six runs over 5 1/3 innings. He had gone 4-0 and the Rays were 7-0 in his previous seven starts since May 27.	"This one is real frustrating for a number of reasons," said Sonnanstine, who grew up about 40 miles south of Cleveland in Wadsworth, Ohio. "We'd lost the last [three] and I look at myself as a stopper. I had a lot of family and friends in the stands. To get beat up like this in a blowout, it's not a good feeling."	The Rays have hit only .182 (25-for-137) during their losing streak, which ties their longest of the season. They lost four in a row April 6-9.	"We're getting into swinging for the five-run homer instead of playing offense," Rays manager Joe Maddon said. "We're not getting enough runners on base. I believe everybody is trying to hit the ball out of the ballpark. We have to get away from that."	Game notes	 The Rays are trying to be the fourth team to be in first place at the All-Star break one year after having the majors' worst record, joining the 1989 Orioles and 2001 Cubs and Phillies. ... The Indians claimed RHP Bryan Bullington, the No. 1 pick in the 2002 amateur draft, on waivers from the Pittsburgh and sold Triple-A INF Ryan Mulhern and RHP Dan Reichert to the Pirates. Bullington was assigned to Triple-A Buffalo. ... The Indians signed 2B Cord Phelps, their third-round pick in last month's draft. ...

PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Many pitchers wish they could redo a start against the New York Yankees. Paul Maholm did, and couldn't have been much happier with the result.	Nate McLouth got a second chance after messing up a bunt attempt, and it turned out much better, too.	McLouth hit a go-ahead two-run homer in the seventh and Maholm allowed two runs over eight innings as the Pittsburgh Pirates rallied to beat the Yankees 4-2 on Thursday night.	The last game of interleague play this season was the makeup of a June 26 rainout, only with a much different result for Maholm (6-5). Then, he gave up extra-base hits to the first four batters as the Yankees went 5-of-12 while taking a 3-0 lead against the left-hander, only to have the statistics wiped out by a heavy rain.	Given a chance to replay that start -- his turn in the rotation coincidentally fell on the makeup date -- Maholm got 17 of his 24 outs by ground balls or strikeouts. He gave up seven hits and walked one while lasting eight innings for a second successive start.	"When that game was rained out, everything got wiped away and I could concentrate on the Reds and Brewers after that and I was able to throw good against them," said Maholm, 4-0 in his last eight starts. "To come back in against these guys, and their stacked lineup, I had the confidence to mix pitches and just go after them and not worry about who's in the box."	Maholm had a five-hit shutout going with two outs and none on in the seventh before the Yankees tied it on Bobby Abreu's two-run single. After McLouth hit his 18th homer to put Pittsburgh back into the lead, Maholm came back with a scoreless eighth.	"That homer was a big relief for me," Maholm said.	Damaso Marte finished for his fourth save in six opportunities, helping end New York's five-game winning streak.	"When we made good contact, it was right at somebody," Abreu said. "We had no luck. But he pitched a pretty good game."	The Pirates won two of three from the Yankees in interleague play, their first two victories against them since the 1960 World Series and a turnaround from past interleague results. The Yankees, 10-8 against the NL this season, are a major league-best 123-87 since interleague play began in 1997 and the Pirates, 6-9 this year against the AL, own the worst record at 63-103.	Despite the Yankees' loss, the AL topped the NL in interleague play for a fifth consecutive season, going 149-103.	Jack Wilson, who doubled and singled against Mike Mussina in his first two-bats as Pittsburgh's No. 9 hitter, walked ahead of McLouth's drive into the right-field seats on a 0-1 pitch by reliever Jose Veras (2-1).	"I tried to throw it outside, but the pitch moved inside to his hands and he's got quick hands," said Veras, who had a 0.52 ERA in his 16 most recent appearances. "He just got it, that's all."	McLouth unsuccessfully tried to bunt on Veras' first pitch, only to homer on the second.	"I messed up the bunt the pitch before and, luckily, got a pitch to hit the next pitch and didn't miss it," said McLouth, who is hitting .333 since being named as the Pirates' lone All-Star. "The inning before, they mounted a rally and tied the game up and looked to have momentum on their side, so to take it back was big."	McLouth also set up the Pirates' run in the fifth by reaching on a force play, stealing second and moving to third on catcher Jose Molina's throwing error.	Freddy Sanchez, the 2006 NL batting champion who came into the game hitting .226, drove in the Pirates' first two runs with an RBI single following Wilson's double in the third and a sacrifice fly two innings later.	Mussina didn't figure in the decision, failing to get 12 victories before the All-Star break for the first time since he was 12-3 in 2002. He gave up nine hits and two runs in six innings, lasting at least six for the eighth consecutive start.	"I didn't feel particularly sharp, but I can't complain a lot," Mussina "You've got to battle through those days, too ... and I'm happy with my first half."	Game notes	 The Yankees are playing in three cities in three days, and in two countries. They played Wednesday at home and will be in Toronto on Friday night. ... Mussina's two-out single in the fifth was his first hit since June 23, 2002, and the only hit by a Yankees pitcher this season. ... Abreu had eight RBIs against Pittsburgh. ... The crowd of 39,081 was the third-largest since PNC Park opened in 2001. Three of the Pirates' four home sellouts this season were against the Yankees. ... The Pirates had lost four of six. ... Maholm struck out three times as the Pirates' No. 8 hitter, leaving three on base. ... New York stayed 6 1/2 games back in the AL East as Tampa Bay lost its fourth in a row, 13-2 to Cleveland.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

TORONTO (AP) -- Baltimore closer George Sherrill's spectacular first half is coming to an end on a sour note.	Adam Lind drove in the go-ahead run in the ninth inning and the Toronto Blue Jays rallied to beat the Orioles 6-5 on Thursday night to complete a three-game sweep.	Leading 5-4 in the ninth, Baltimore handed the ball to Sherrill (2-4), who struck out pinch-hitter Marco Scutaro but gave up a single to Rod Barajas and a double to Scott Rolen. Pinch-hitter Gregg Zaun was walked intentionally to load the bases for Lyle Overbay, who tied the game with a sacrifice fly.	Lind followed with a single to right, bringing home Rolen with the decisive run that gave Sherrill his sixth blown save and third in five appearances.	"They jumped on first pitches a lot," Sherrill said. "I was just trying to get ahead and they got some pretty good pitches to hit."	Blue Jays right-hander Shawn Camp (2-1) worked one inning for the victory.	Lind went 1-for-19 in brief callup earlier this season, but finished 3-for-4 Thursday and is hitting .320 (16-for-50) since returning to the majors June 21.	"He's just getting better all the time," Toronto manager Cito Gaston said. "He's hit everywhere he's played and he's starting to do that up here, too."	The winning rally came one inning after Toronto scored twice in the eighth against Orioles setup man Jim Johnson.	"We had it set up with the right guys in the right spots and it didn't happen for us," Baltimore manager Dave Trembley said.	The Orioles lost their fifth straight, matching a season high.	Sherrill said a lack of regular work in recent weeks has made it hard for him to feel comfortable when he comes into games.	"It gets tough to find a rhythm," Sherrill said. "I guess I'll have to do a little bit more work when I have a few days off in between."	The late collapse spoiled seven strong innings from Orioles right-hander Jeremy Guthrie, who allowed two runs and four hits.	"He pitched out of some tough spots late in the game, made some big pitches," Trembley said. "Obviously we would have liked to have gotten him a win."	Baltimore opened the scoring in the first when Nick Markakis doubled, extending his hitting streak to a career-high 17 games, and scored on a two-out single by Aubrey Huff.	The Orioles made it 3-0 in the second. Melvin Mora and Jay Payton began the inning with consecutive doubles and Payton went to third on a fly ball before scoring on Brandon Fahey's grounder.	The Blue Jays got one back in the fourth when Joe Inglett singled, moved to second on a grounder, went to third on a passed ball and scored when Alex Rios grounded out.	Toronto cut it to 3-2 in the sixth when Lind doubled and came around on grounders by Inglett and David Eckstein.	The Orioles added two more in the eighth against relievers Brian Tallet and Brandon League, loading the bases on a single by Brian Roberts, an intentional walk to Huff and a walk to Ramon Hernandez before Mora lined a two-run single to right.	Toronto replied with RBI grounders by Inglett and Eckstein against Johnson in the bottom half, setting up the ninth-inning rally.	"I gave them back the momentum and you can't do that in a close game, especially on the road," Johnson said.	Pitching for the first time since June 28, and making only his second appearance of the season, Toronto left-hander John Parrish overcame early struggles to work seven innings. He allowed three runs and six hits, walked two and struck out three.	The Orioles had two runners thrown out on the bases in the fifth. Roberts drew a one-out walk and was caught trying to steal second. Markakis followed with a walk but was picked off first by Parrish to end the inning.	Rolen made the defensive play of the game in the first, diving into foul territory to snag a smash by Kevin Millar, then throwing to first from his knees.	Millar was victimized again in the eighth when right fielder Brad Wilkerson raced into foul territory to make a sliding, backhanded catch.	Game notes	 All three games in the series were decided by one run. ... Before the game, Toronto placed outfielder Vernon Wells (strained hamstring) on the 15-day DL. Wells, who was injured on a steal of third Wednesday, is expected to miss four to six weeks. Outfielder Kevin Mench has been recalled from Triple-A Syracuse and will join the team Friday. ... An MRI on the shoulder of Blue Jays right-hander Dustin McGowan revealed no further damage to a tear in his rotator cuff. McGowan is expected to miss at least four weeks.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Third baseman Mark Reynolds made two errors in the bottom of the ninth, when the Arizona Diamondbacks blew a two-run lead.	The craziness was only just beginning.	Reynolds doubled in the 10th to help his team build a three-run lead, and even that wasn't enough. It wasn't until the 11th inning that Arizona went ahead and stayed there, scoring twice for a wild 7-5 victory over the Washington Nationals on Thursday night.	"I tried to mess it up for us," said Reynolds, who misplayed two two-hoppers during the Nationals' rally that tied the game 2-2 after nine. "They picked me up tonight. It was just one of those days. Baseball -- that's the way it goes."	Well, it doesn't go like this often.	The Diamondbacks led 2-0 after 8½ innings and 5-2 after 9½. Both times the Nationals had the winning run in scoring position with less than two outs but couldn't finish off the game.	"We've had some games that have gone back and forth some," Arizona manager Bob Melvin said, "but not as dramatically as that."	Stephen Drew hit a one-out RBI double and Chad Tracy added a run-scoring single with two outs -- both off Luis Ayala (1-5) -- for the game's final runs as the seesawing Diamondbacks (46-46) again improved their record to .500. Chad Qualls (2-6) pitched 1 1/3 innings for the victory.	The Nationals lost for the seventh time in eight games, wasting another fine start by Jason Bergmann. He allowed two runs and six hits over seven innings and has received a meager eight runs of support in his last 11 starts.	"If our offense could come back like that every day, we're looking at a really exciting ballclub," Bergmann said. "We thought we were going to pull that one out."	Diamondbacks All-Star starter Dan Haren struck out a season-high nine, walked two and allowed just three hits. He departed after two batters reached base to open the ninth, leaving him three outs short of his first career shutout.	Brandon Lyon entered and allowed a single to load the bases with no outs. Austin Kearns then hit a hard grounder to third, but Reynolds backed up on the ball and let it get past him into left field. Two runs scored to tie the game.	Two outs later, Reynolds misplayed another grounder to load the bases, but it turned out not to cost the Diamondbacks the victory because Lyon was able to retire rookie Roger Bernadina on a groundout to second, sending the game to extra innings.	"People are going to forget that I pitched today," Haren said. "And people are going to forget that Lyon pitched today, but he did a tremendous job."	With the score tied 2-2 after nine, Reynolds helped compensate for his gaffes when he doubled off the left-field wall, one of four consecutive two-out hits off Jon Rauch that made it 5-2.	Tony Pena entered in the bottom of the 10th and couldn't hold the lead. Washington cleanup hitter Kearns -- batting .198 entering the game -- got the big hit, a two-run double off the left-field wall.	But the Nationals couldn't finish the job. With runners on first and third and one out, Qualls got Jesus Flores to hit a grounder to Reynolds, who cleanly fielded the ball this time and threw to the catcher for the putout. Wily Mo Pena then grounded out to send the game to the 11th, when the Diamondbacks managed to put together one last rally.	"It just shows a lot about the team," Tracy said. "We just kept grinding and grinding, and there were some situations where it got a little hairy."	Game notes	 Had the Nationals not scored in the ninth, the Diamondbacks and Nationals would have become the first teams to play each other in five straight shutout games in 28 years, according to Stats LLC. The Chicago White Sox and Oakland Athletics accomplished the unusual feat in 1980. ... More runs were scored in the last 2½ innings (10) than in the rest of the three-game series combined (nine).	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- The Los Angeles Angels and Texas Rangers combined for 21 runs, 32 hits and five homers. And yet, despite all those offensive fireworks, Thursday night's game turned on a couple of softly hit balls in the 11th and final inning.	Maicer Izturis drove in the go-ahead run with a pinch-hit single in the 11th, and the Angels survived a shaky three outs from closer Francisco Rodriguez in an 11-10 victory over the Rangers.	Tied at 10, Garret Anderson led off the 11th with a single off Jamey Wright (5-4) and went to second on pinch-hitter Reggie Willits' sacrifice bunt. Howie Kendrick, who hit his first two homers of the season for the first multihomer game of his three-year career, struck out, before Izturis blooped a run-scoring single into shallow center.	"It was a strange game," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "It was ironic with all that offense that the last run scored on a sac bunt and a bloop hit."	Rodriguez, who blew a save Wednesday night, made things interesting in the bottom half of the 11th.	He walked Brandon Boggs leading off, and Max Ramirez bunted a ball high in the air that Rodriguez at first misjudged, then tried to turn into a double play. Instead, Rodriguez threw the ball into center field and both runners reached base safely.	Ian Kinsler popped out a bunt attempt, though, and Ramon Vazquez took a called third strike before Michael Young grounded out on a sharply hit ball to give Rodriguez his 36th save in 39 chances.	"In his world, if [Rodriguez] blows a save, he forgets about it 20 minutes later," Scioscia said. "He's good at turning the page."	Rodriguez was thankful for the opportunity to redeem himself.	"It was nice to win the game," Rodriguez said. "Otherwise it would have been a tough loss after what happened last night."	Justin Speier (1-4) allowed one hit in a scoreless 10th.	Josh Hamilton, Marlon Byrd and Ramirez homered for the Rangers, who had a season-high 20 hits and rallied from a six-run deficit to send the game into extra innings.	"Nobody thought we were in that game, but we fought back," Rangers manager Ron Washington said.	Angels starter John Lackey allowed 15 hits in 5 2/3 innings, exiting with a 10-6 lead in what became a no-decision when the Rangers rallied with a four-run seventh against the Los Angeles bullpen, capped by Ramirez's two-run shot.	Lackey gave up six runs, struck out five and walked one. The 15 hits allowed tied the Angels' record for a starter set by Paul Hartzell on Sept. 9, 1976, at Kansas City, but Hartzell was at least able to last 8 2/3 innings.	"I thought I might steal one [a victory]," Lackey said. "But I can't complain. I didn't deserve it with the way I pitched."	The Angels built a 10-4 lead in the fifth, but the Rangers got a run in the inning on Byrd's homer and another run in the sixth on Young's RBI single.	Texas pulled within 10-7 in the seventh on Chris Davis' RBI double. Washington argued that Davis' drive should have been called a home run and he was ejected by crew chief Mike Reilly, who made the original call and then huddled with the other umpires to confirm his decision.	Boggs followed with a run-scoring single off Scot Shields, and Ramirez tied it at 10 with a two-run shot, his second of the season.	"He tried to throw me a fastball in, and the game was tied right there," Ramirez said. "It seemed like we were going to win, but it didn't happen."	Los Angeles left the bases loaded in the ninth when Rangers closer C.J. Wilson retired Jeff Mathis on a fly ball.	Hamilton homered for the second straight game, a day after his two-run ninth-inning shot off Rodriguez lifted the Rangers to a dramatic victory. His 91 RBIs are tops in the majors and fifth-most in major league history before the All-Star break.	In the third, Hamilton ripped Lackey's 1-0 pitch for his 21st homer and a 4-3 lead. But Rangers starter Scott Feldman couldn't hold the lead as the Angels scored five times in the fourth.	Los Angeles kept up the pressure in the fifth against Wes Littleton with Kendrick's two-run shot for a 10-4 lead, giving Kendrick 11 major league homers in three big league seasons.	The Rangers took a 2-0 lead in the first, but the Angels pulled within 2-1 in the second on Kendrick's first homer since Sept. 4, 2007.	Kinsler's single in the second stretched his hitting streak to a career-high 22 games.	Game notes	 Hamilton was the DH, getting a game off from playing the outfield. Milton Bradley didn't start for the second straight game to rest a sore left knee, but pinch hit in the 10th. ... Washington said Bradley will definitely play in the All-Star game despite the tender knee. ... Angels All-Star LHP Joe Saunders was still at home with his wife in California awaiting the birth of their first child. Saunders has been away from the team the last two days but is still scheduled to start Sunday at Oakland. ... Rangers C Gerald Laird has gone to the minor league camp in Arizona to begin his rehab from a left hamstring strain that has kept him out of the last 18 games. The Rangers expect Laird back on July 18.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- In this series, it wasn't safe to take a lead.	The Chicago White Sox overcame deficits of 4-1 and 5-0 to beat Kansas City in the first two games. On Thursday night, it was the Royals' turn as they scored four runs in the eighth, capped by Mark Teahen's inside-the-park homer, and emerged with a 4-1 victory to avoid being swept.	"When I hit it, I was going hard trying to make sure I got a triple," said Teahen, who also had an inside-the-parker on May 27 against Minnesota.	But as second baseman Alexei Ramirez hesitated momentarily before making the relay throw to the infield, third base coach Luis Silverio frantically waved on Teahen.	"I trust him. He hasn't run me into too many outs," Teahen said.	The frantic ending ruined an otherwise splendid outing by White Sox starter Mark Buehrle, and kept Royals starter Zack Greinke from losing one of the best games he's thrown all year.	Jermaine Dye, after learning he finished second in fan voting for the final AL All-Star spot, crushed a towering home run off Greinke in the fourth. Then Buehrle, a longtime Royals nemesis, took a four-hit shutout into the eighth but came out after giving up an RBI double to Mike Aviles that tied it 1-1.	After Jose Guillen made it 2-1 with an RBI double off Octavio Dotel, Teahen slammed Boone Logan's pitch into right-center and provided what Royals manager Trey Hillman calls one of the most thrilling sights in baseball.	"I don't think there are many more exciting things for the fans than to see a come-from-behind victory like that and then topped off with an inside-the-park home run," Hillman said. "It's pretty exciting."	As Teahen kept coming, the throw came wide to catcher A.J. Pierzynski and the runner slid around his sweeping tag.	"You have to give credit to them. They kept battling," Chicago manager Ozzie Guillen said. "The last three days here they have battled back. It's fun, because from one inning to another, you don't know what's going to happen."	Dotel had struck out the side on 10 pitches in the ninth inning of Chicago's come-from-behind, 7-6 victory the night before.	The winner was reliever Ron Mahay (5-0), who pitched one inning and struck out two. Joakim Soria, the Royals' only All-Star, pitched the ninth for his 24th save in 26 opportunities.	Buehrle gave up a leadoff single to John Buck in the eighth and David DeJesus hit a hot grounder to shortstop Orlando Cabrera, who tossed to Ramirez for the force.	But when Ramirez threw to first for the double play, Paul Konerko dropped the ball after a wide throw and DeJesus was safe. Originally, official scorer Del Black did not rule an error. But he later changed the call to an error on Konerko.	Aviles then doubled home the tying run, bringing Dotel out of the bullpen. Guillen mashed a double off the wall in straightaway center before Teahen came to the plate.	Buehrle (6-8) gave up six hits in 7 1/3 innings and had a season-high eight strikeouts while losing to the Royals for the first time in five decisions. It was the third time this year he has not issued a walk.	"I felt strong until the last inning," he said. "Everything happened so quick. It seemed like 5 seconds, and we're down 4-1."	Dye broke an 0-for-13 slide with the towering homer off Greinke, who went seven innings and gave up six hits, with one walk and eight strikeouts.	Game notes	 Steve Mingori, who pitched for his hometown Royals from 1973-79, died of natural causes, the club said. Mingori was 64. He made 264 of his 385 major league appearances with the Royals. ... The Royals have extended their working agreement with the Class-A Wilmington (Del.) Blue Rocks through the 2010 season. ... Because of the error, both runs charged to Buehrle were unearned.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Each time Hanley Ramirez came to the plate, the Florida Marlins had no one in scoring position. That turned out to be a blessing for them, considering the vast difference in his average with runners in scoring position and without.	Ramirez homered with two outs in the 11th inning, capping the first five-hit game of his career and helping the Marlins beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-4 on Thursday night.	Ramirez, the starting shortstop for the NL in next Tuesday's All-Star game, is batting only .219 with runners in scoring position -- but .334 the rest of the time.	"I don't know why," Ramirez said. "I think I just try to do too much when I've got men on base and I think I put more pressure on myself. So I've got to keep working on that and try to stay the same. I've got a lot to improve on."	Ramirez was 5-for-6 and raised his average to .317. The Marlins' leadoff hitter singled his first three times up and doubled in his next at-bat. His 23rd homer of the season came on the first pitch he saw from Brian Falkenborg (1-2)	"We were just trying to keep the ball down. But with a guy like that, if you just miss by a couple of inches, the ball is gone. And that's what happened," catcher Russell Martin said. "Sometimes you can try to stay away from guys like that, but he's one of those freaks where he's got so much power to all fields."	Joe Nelson (2-0) pitched two hitless innings for the win and Kevin Gregg got three outs for his 18th save in 24 attempts.	Marlins right-hander Josh Johnson threw 88 pitches over five innings in his first appearance since July 4, 2007, allowing three runs, three hits and no walks while striking out six.	Johnson was 0-3 in his four starts last season, pitching a total of 15 2/3 innings and allowing 13 earned runs before undergoing Tommy John surgery on Aug. 3. The 24-year-old right-hander began the 2007 campaign on the disabled list, missing almost three months because of nerve irritation in his arm.	"It was tough. I went through last year trying to rehab it and stuff, and it just wasn't right from the beginning," Johnson said of his surgically repaired elbow. "But I went in with the right attitude, being positive and working hard every day. That's what brought me back here.	"It's been a long time coming. I felt great out there, and that was the main thing I wanted to get out of this. My control is what I focused on in my rehab starts -- pounding the zone and not walking anybody."	John Baker hit his first major league home run for the Marlins, who tied a franchise mark by homering in their 12th consecutive game. They had a pair of 12-game streaks last season after the All-Star break. Florida has hit 131 home runs altogether, after hitting a club-record 201 in 2007.	Dan Uggla returned to the Florida lineup after missing 11 games with a left ankle strain and was 0-for-3 with two walks. The All-Star second baseman was leading the majors with 23 home runs on June 28 when he was injured trying to stretch a single into a double against Arizona.	Dodgers right-hander Chan Ho Park was charged with four runs -- three earned -- and nine hits over four innings. He is 1-2 with a 2.16 ERA in five starts after beginning the season in the bullpen, and is expected to remain in the rotation until Brad Penny recovers from shoulder problems that have sidelined the two-time All-Star since June 13.	Martin greeted reliever Ryan Tucker with his 10th home run leading off the sixth, tying the score at 4-all after the Marlins regained the lead with an RBI single by Johnson -- who has six hits and four RBIs in 51 big league at-bats.	The Dodgers tied it at 3-all in the third with two-out RBI singles by Matt Kemp, Andre Ethier and Martin. Johnson had struck out five of his first seven batters before No. 8 hitter Angel Berroa triggered the Dodgers' rally with a one-out single.	"I thought he looked pretty solid," Martin said of Johnson. "The first time through the lineup, he was outstanding -- hitting his spots and throwing that backdoor breaking ball real nicely. Pitch after pitch, he seemed like he was throwing it right where he wanted it. It was a pretty good start for his first time back."	Ramirez opened the game with an infield single that triggered a two-run first inning. He advanced on Park's first balk since 2004 with Texas, and Jorge Cantu singled him home. Center fielder Kemp bobbled Cantu's hit, allowing him to take an extra base, and Josh Willingham followed with an RBI double over Kemp's head.	The Marlins added a run in the second when Baker parked a 1-2 pitch over the right-field fence.	Game notes	 Ramirez committed his 16th error on Martin's routine grounder in the eighth, but Martin was stranded at second when Renyel Pinto struck out Andruw Jones. ... The Dodgers reached an agreement with their first-round draft pick, RHP Ethan Martin, the 15th overall selection. Their last five No. 1 picks all have been high school pitchers, including Chad Billingsley and Clayton Kershaw, who is back in the minors after going 0-2 with a 4.42 ERA this season in his first eight big league starts. ... Florida's Cody Ross extended his career-best hitting streak to 14 games with a single in the eighth.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO (AP) -- The weather at Wrigley Field may change in an instant, but Aramis Ramirez is always steady in the clutch.	Ramirez broke a scoreless tie with a three-run homer in the eighth to send the Chicago Cubs to a 3-1 win over the San Francisco Giants on Friday.	After getting shut down by Giants starter Matt Cain for seven innings as the wind whipped in from Lake Michigan, the Cubs struck quickly against his replacement and held off a ninth-inning rally to send the Giants to their fifth straight loss.	Ryan Theriot led off the bottom of the eighth with a single off Tyler Walker and Mike Fontenot sacrificed him to second. After Walker (3-5) intentionally walked Derrek Lee, Ramirez launched the first pitch just inside the foul pole in left for his 17th home run, sending the packed crowd into a frenzy.	"He always seems to come through in the clutch like that," Theriot said. "He's definitely the guy we want at the plate in that situation and he's proven time and time again, that's when he shines."	After Theriot went to second, Giants manager Bruce Bochy called for the intentional walk of Lee, hoping Walker could get a double play.	"You're caught in a hard spot," Bochy said. "You've got two great hitters, similar-type hitters. We were hoping maybe to get out of it with one pitch. They've got two great hitters back-to-back. You're going to face one of them."	Ramirez said he agreed with Bochy's strategy. In that spot, he said he wasn't trying for a home run.	"You don't want to think home run in that situation," Ramirez said. "You just want to try and put the ball in play. If you hit it on a line, maybe it goes out. But if you hit it in the air, it's not going to go out."	Cubs manager Lou Piniella wouldn't say Ramirez is his best clutch hitter, but said he's certainly up there.	"Ramirez is a professional hitter, and he gives you a professional at-bat," Piniella said. "He's got an idea what he wants to do and he goes up there and makes adjustment. He got a good fastball to hit and he hit it really well."	Bob Howry (3-2) pitched a perfect eighth to get the win. Kerry Wood pitched the ninth for his 24th save.	The Giants have scored four runs total in the last four games, and barely avoided being shut out for the third time in those four games, wasting a great effort from Cain.	"It's a hard one to lose when you get that kind of pitching effort," Bochy said. "When Matt's on like he was today, he's tough."	Ray Durham led off the ninth with a double after Mark DeRosa hesitated on a flyball to left. Wood then walked Eugenio Velez and Bengie Molina drove in Durham with a single and sent Velez to third.	Emmanuel Burriss, running for Molina, stole second as Wood struck out Aaron Rowand. John Bowker flied out to right and Wood then got Rich Aurilia to ground out to first to end the game.	"Woody came in and closed it, made that a little exciting too," Piniella said. "But it's in the win column."	Cubs pitcher Jason Marquis had a no-hitter going into the fifth until John Bowker led off with a single that bounced off Marquis' leg. Marquis was examined by the trainer but stayed in the game.	Marquis gave up three hits and two walks, striking out four, in seven innings. He got skipped in the rotation after losing to Cain 2-1 on July 1, giving him a fresh arm to work with.	"He worked that sinker in and out, and the slider too," Bowker said. "When you're hitting your spots like that, it's tough to get a rally going."	Two hours before the game, it looked like a repeat of Thursday's fireworks, when the Cincinnati Reds hit seven homers in a 12-7 win. The wind was blowing out and the temperature was climbing toward the 90s during batting practice before rain clouds came in and the wind shifted directions.	"The wind was blowing out in BP and we were having fun watching Carlos [Zambrano] hit balls out of the ballpark," Marquis said. "I was inside watching TV and a couple guys came in and said it's 15 degrees cooler and the wind's blowing in. I didn't believe them."	The Cubs were stymied by Cain for the second time this month, as the big right-hander gave up three hits and struck out nine in seven innings. When he beat the Cubs 10 days ago, he threw eight scoreless innings and struck out 10.	"I was trying to go at them," Cain said. "They're definitely a club that can swing the bat well, so maybe you try to use some of those aggressive swings a little bit to your advantage."	Cain gave up just one hit through his first five innings, a Theriot flyball that could've been ruled an error. Durham dropped it drifting back in shallow right, and the play was initially ruled an error, but was quickly changed to a hit.

BOSTON (AP) -- The last time he faced the Baltimore Orioles at Fenway Park, Clay Buchholz overcame the nerves of his second major-league start and the mounting pressure of making baseball history to pitch a no-hitter.	Looks like he didn't get all the jitters out of his system.	Brian Roberts greeted Buchholz with a game-opening double and was a home run short of the cycle Friday night as Baltimore knocked the Red Sox right-hander around in the first inning and beat Boston 7-3.	Brian Burres (7-5) pitched his longest outing in eight tries, allowing three runs and six hits before leaving with a 4-3 lead with one out in the seventh to outpitch the 23-year-old Texan who no-hit Baltimore on Sept. 1.	"That's a long time ago. That's over and done with," Roberts said. "You certainly want to get off to a good start, whether it's Roger Clemens or Buchholz or whoever. But Burres was the star of the game. He pitched really well and gave us what we needed. To pitch 6 1/3 here, that's pretty good."	Red Sox shortstop Julio Lugo pulled up lame and left the game after singling with two outs in the ninth. Brandon Fahey let Jacoby Ellsbury's grounder go through his legs at shortstop, then George Sherrill came on and walked Dustin Pedroia to load the bases before striking out Kevin Youkilis to earn his 28th save.	Manager Terry Francona said Lugo injured his left quadriceps and will be evaluated Saturday.	"He did it pretty good," Francona said. "I think there's a pretty good chance he didn't just strain it."	Buchholz retired just one of the first five batters he faced before settling down, striking out five out of six batters in the third and fourth innings. He gave up four runs, five hits and five walks in five innings.	"I haven't been that nervous in a long time," Buchholz (2-4) said. "Maybe [I was] trying a little bit too hard ... being out there for the first time in a while, trying to prove a point, trying to let everybody know this is where I want to be and this is where I want to be for a long time."	It was a little surprising to hear that from a guy who managed to keep his composure while pitching a no-hitter last fall. He followed that five days later with three innings of one-hit relief, also against the Orioles; none of the current Baltimore batters had ever gotten a hit off of him.	But he struggled this season before splitting a fingernail on his pitching hand and then spending time in the minors to work on his mechanics.	"I think it was just so new to me last year, I didn't know what to expect," he said. "Now I know what this team does: This team is here to win and produce championships. And to be a part of that, sometimes nerves might get the better of you."	Roberts, who finished fourth in the fan balloting for final spot on the AL roster for the All-Star game, and No. 9 hitter Brandon Fahey had five of the Orioles' seven hits.	"He's not going to New York as an All-Star, but he's an All-Star player for us and he's an All-Star player for me," said Baltimore manager Dave Trembley, whose team snapped a five-game losing streak and handed the Red Sox a rare home loss. "What he does for the club, and what he does to make the team go, speaks for itself. The way he played tonight was pretty darn good, pretty darn good."	The Red Sox returned to Fenway Park from a 3-7 road trip to sweep Minnesota and -- even with Friday's loss -- their 34-11 home record is the best in the AL.	Roberts led off the game with a double, stole third and scored on a sacrifice fly. In the fifth, Fahey singled and Roberts tripled him home before scoring on Aubrey Huff's sacrifice fly to make it 4-3.	But the home-crowd advantage didn't help the Red Sox when a fan reached over the short wall in right and interfered with Sean Casey's second-inning double. And it didn't hold any sway with first base umpire Doug Eddings three batters later, with Casey on third, when Lugo was called out on a grounder to first even though replays showed he was safe by a step.	"I saw what you saw," Francona said.	Ellsbury grounded out to end the inning, and the Red Sox were out a run.	They made it 3-2 in the fourth when Jason Varitek singled, took third on Brandon Moss' double and scored on Lugo's groundout.	Moss and Manny Ramirez both had two hits.	Game notes	 Red Sox RF J.D. Drew was out of the lineup for a second consecutive game with a "tweaked" back. Francona said he thinks Drew will be back Saturday. CF Coco Crisp sat out with a forearm injury of unknown nature and cause. ... Boston DH David Ortiz, who has been on the DL since injuring a tendon sheath in his left wrist on May 30, took some practice swings in the batting cage before the game. ... Orioles RF Nick Markakis walked three times but went 0-for-2 to snap a 17-game hitting streak. ... Pedroia walked twice and ended a 17-game hitting streak. ... Buchholz, who pitched three innings of one-hit relief on Sept. 6 in his other career appearance vs. Baltimore, was called up from Triple-A Pawtucket before the game.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cliff Lee is going to the All-Star game on another shutout streak.	Cleveland's left-hander pitched six stellar innings in a warm-up for a possible All-Star start at Yankee Stadium as the Indians defeated Tampa Bay 5-0 on Friday night to extend the Rays' season-high losing streak to five games.	"I'm just happy to be going," Lee (12-2) said of being selected to the AL squad for the first time. "If they choose me to start, I'd be ecstatic and honored. I'm just planning to show up and try to do all I can to help my team win."	That's exactly what Lee did against Tampa Bay, joining Joe Saunders of the Los Angeles Angels for the AL lead in wins while lowering his ERA to 2.31.	"He's deserving of [an All-Star] start," Indians manager Eric Wedge said.	Jhonny Peralta hit a two-run homer and RBI double off James Shields (7-6) as the Indians beat the Rays in Cleveland for the 11th consecutive time since Sept. 29, 2005.	The Indians entered the four-game series on a 10-game losing streak -- their longest in 29 years -- but have claimed consecutive wins for the first time since June 26-27.	"It's surely messing up our seven-game winning streak," Rays manager Joe Maddon said.	Tampa Bay had won seven a row to open a five-game lead in the AL East on July 6. A 10-inning loss Monday to Kansas City started the Rays on their current slide, in which they've been outscored 32-7 and had their lead trimmed to 1 1/2 games over the Boston Red Sox.	"I'm not concerned," Maddon said. "We'll get through this. You're not going to be void of these moments in a season. They're going to happen."	Lee allowed five hits and struck out seven, improving to 5-0 with a 1.62 ERA in seven home starts. It was the sixth time in 18 starts he didn't allow an earned run.	His only walk was to Akinori Iwamura to start the game -- his second to a left-handed batter in 124 2/3 innings this season. Lee then struck out the next three batters.	Tampa Bay put its leadoff hitter on base each time through four innings.	"I seemed to pitch better out of the stretch all night," Lee said. "I've had a good first half, but I also got some breaks and there's a lot of things I could do better. Not allowing the first guy in an inning to reach all the time would be good."	Shields, seeking to win his fourth straight start, instead gave up five runs and 10 hits over six innings.	"I felt I pitched well," Shields said. "I can count four hits that easily could be outs. That's going to happen. It's part of the game. I probably made about four bad pitches."	Ben Francisco singled with two outs in the first and was running on a 3-2 pitch to Peralta, who lined it over the head of right fielder Jonny Gomes for an RBI double.	In the third, Francisco, who had a career-high four RBIs in Cleveland's 13-2 win Thursday, hit a two-out double. Peralta then drove a 2-0 pitch the opposite way into the Rays' bullpen in right for his 15th homer and 3-0 lead.	Peralta is 5-for-11 with three homers and seven RBIs in his career against Shields.	"I don't think he likes me too much," Peralta said. "I don't know why, but I can see the ball good against him."	Francisco made it 4-0 in the fifth with a double high off the wall in center, scoring Jamey Carroll, who had singled.	Grady Sizemore, who will join Lee in the All-Star game on Tuesday night, doubled to lead off the seventh for his first hit in 12 career at-bats against Shields. Sizemore scored on Carroll's single up the middle.	Tampa Bay has hit .192 (33-for-172) with 48 strikeouts during its losing streak. Iwamura and Carl Crawford, the top two hitters in the order, are a combined 5-for-50 (.100).	"When you don't hit, the whole team looks bad," Maddon said. "When you don't score runs, you put a lot of pressure on your pitching staff."	Game notes	 After the game, Cleveland optioned RHP Brian Slocum to Triple-A Buffalo and called up RHP Matt Ginter to start Saturday night. ... Rays rookie 3B Evan Longoria, who has 16 homers, will participate in the Home Run Derby at Yankee Stadium on Monday night. ... Indians RHP Fausto Carmona, out since May 24 with a strained left hip, is scheduled to start a rehab assignment Monday at Class A Lake County. ... Rays manager Joe Maddon said RHP Troy Percival will test his strained left hamstring by throwing off the mound Saturday. ... Rays RHP Al Reyes (shoulder tendinitis) pitched one scoreless rehab inning for Class A Vero Beach on Thursday. ... Rays SS Jason Bartlett (sprained right knee) swung a bat and fielded grounders Friday, but his lateral movement still isn't 100 percent, Maddon said.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DETROIT (AP) -- The Twins hoped they didn't have to use Matt Guerrier and his bullpen mates after a long outing the previous night. They hardly showed any sign of fatigue.	Guerrier, Jesse Crain and closer Joe Nathan retired the last seven Detroit batters Friday night to help Minnesota win its second straight against the Tigers, 3-2. The win came a day after the trio threw a combined 81 pitches in five frames of an 11-inning victory.	"We've all pretty much worked hard innings but we had to be ready for anything tonight," said Guerrier, who made his fifth appearance in seven games but struck out the first two batters when he faced the heart of Detroit's order in the eighth.	The win drew Minnesota within 1 1/2 games of the AL Central-leading White Sox, who lost Friday at Texas.	Crain came on with two on in the seventh in relief of Glen Perkins (6-2) and got Carlos Guillen to fly out to the deepest part of the park. Carlos Gomez made the catch at the warning track -- about 415 feet from the plate -- to end the threat.	Nathan, an All-Star, earned his 26th save in 28 chances with a perfect ninth.	As good as his relievers were, manager Ron Gardenhire was glad Perkins was able to last as long as he did.	"It was a very exciting ballgame again," said the manager, whose team has beaten the Tigers four straight times. "It was all Perkins. We needed that performance."	Perkins won his second straight start -- he's 2-0 against Detroit in three outings this season -- after allowing six hits.	"They got to me late," he said, "but Crain came in and bailed me out."	Nick Punto had RBIs in the fourth and sixth innings before Delmon Young added a sacrifice fly in the seventh.	Alexi Casilla had three hits for the Twins, who have won 18 of their last 23 games.	Guillen drove home the game's first run with a third-inning single but Minnesota answered an inning later when Punto hit an RBI double.	Punto made it 2-1 with a sacrifice fly in the sixth off rookie starter Armando Galarraga (7-3). Young's sacrifice fly came off Aquilino Lopez and made it 3-1.	The Tigers appeared poised to tie the game or take the lead after loading the bases with one out in the bottom of the seventh but only could manage Placido Polanco's sacrifice fly.	Detroit (46-46), which is 4-9 against Minnesota this season, got just three runners into scoring position before the seventh. The loss dropped the club back to the .500 mark.	"Our offense just didn't do anything," Tigers manager Jim Leyland said. "Too many of our guys had oh-fors.	"We didn't make any opportunities for ourselves. We just didn't do enough."	Galarraga gave up two runs and six hits in 5 2/3 innings. He hasn't won since June 18.	"They are a team of patient hitters and they were able to get my pitch count up, which put me out of my rhythm," he said of the Twins. "You have to give them credit."	Game notes	 Twins 1B Justin Morneau was 1-for-3 with a single and two walks. The All-Star first baseman has reached base nine times in 11 appearances during the current series. ... Detroit CF Curtis Granderson's hitting streak ended at eight games. ... The Tigers agreed to terms with RHP Rick Perry, the 21st overall pick in the 2008 draft. ... Twins OF Denard Span is hitting .454 (15-for-33) with five RBIs since being recalled from triple-A Rochester. His fourth-inning flyout ended a streak of reaching base safely at eight plate appearances.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Arizona Diamondbacks decided to pitch to Jayson Werth with the game on the line Friday night, and Werth was ready.	Werth hit a game-ending RBI single in the 12th inning and the Philadelphia Phillies won 6-5 in a matchup of NL division leaders.	"I was happy to get the hit and get us out of here," said Werth, who was 3-for-7.	Shane Victorino also had three hits for the Phillies, who have won three straight. Victorino tied it at 5 with a two-run triple off Tony Pena in the eighth inning.	So Taguchi led off the 12th with a single to left for Philadelphia. Chris Coste then sacrificed him to second and Connor Robertson (0-1) intentionally walked Jimmy Rollins to get to Werth, who singled to center.	"I tried to go inside with a cutter, but I left it out over the plate and he got some good wood on it," Robertson said.	Rudy Seanez (4-3) pitched a scoreless 12th to earn the win. He had been battling back spasms in recent days, but felt good enough to pitch.	"I would have been out there for as long as they needed me," Seanez said.	Ryan Howard hit his major league-leading 28th home run for the Phillies, extending his hitting streak to a season-high 14 games with a drive to left-center off Doug Davis in the second inning. He has four homers in his last three games and eight in his last 10.	"I've always known Ryan Howard is a good hitter," Philadelphia manager Charlie Manuel said. "It's good. I'm happy for him."	The West-leading Diamondbacks were extended to extra innings for the second straight game after winning 7-5 in 11 innings at Washington on Thursday.	"We made some mistakes early on, but our bats came alive at the end," manager Bob Melvin said. "They just had one more big hit than we did."	Arizona erased a 3-1 deficit with three runs in the seventh. Pinch-hitter Emilio Bonifacio had a two-run single and Stephen Drew drove in the go-ahead run with a base hit.	Davis allowed three runs and five hits in six innings. It was his 10th start since returning to the mound following surgery on April 10 to remove a cancerous thyroid.	Kyle Kendrick yielded four runs and nine hits in 6 1/3 innings for the East-leading Phillies.	"We had our share of chances and the bullpen did a good job," Kendrick said. "It was nice to get a win like this."	Arizona's Chad Tracy tied it at 1 with an RBI single in the sixth. He has hit safely in nine of his last 10 games.	Game notes	 Arizona 3B Mark Reynolds was held out of the starting lineup after committing three errors in Thursday's win at Washington. Reynolds has committed a major league-worst 19 errors this season. Reynolds did appear as a pinch hitter in the 11th.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Kyle Lohse is one of the NL's biggest surprise stories of the season, so his latest effective start wasn't exactly an unexpected development.	This was: The St. Louis Cardinals put together one of their best offensive games in weeks, and it all began with a big inning that already looked to be over.	Lohse limited the Pirates to six hits over seven shutout innings and Rick Ankiel and Ryan Ludwick homered, helping St. Louis break out of a scoring slump with a 6-0 victory over Pittsburgh on Friday night.	Lohse (11-2) won his eighth in a row by limiting the Pirates to one extra-base hit. He hasn't lost in 12 starts since May 9, giving up two runs or fewer in all but two of his last 10 starts.	"This was the one where I don't know if I'm the proudest, but I'm the happiest about the way I went out and pitched because I didn't really feel like I had the best stuff," Lohse said. "When you bear down and make pitches like I was able to, it feels really good to get the win."	Ankiel's two-run drive followed Yadier Molina's two-run double and finished off a decisive four-run third inning, with all the scoring occurring after Pirates starter Zach Duke (4-6) got two quick outs and was ahead of Albert Pujols 1-2 in the count.	Pujols and Troy Glaus singled ahead of Molina's double down the left-field line, and Ankiel hit a 1-0 pitch by Duke into the seats in right-center for his 20th homer. Ludwick made it 5-0 an inning later with his 19th.	"Two outs and two strikes and they scored four runs, that was a big blow to us," Pirates manager John Russell. "If you get through that inning, you don't know what will happen. Four runs, with the way Lohse was pitching, it was tough to come back."	Ankiel went 3-for-3 with a walk and drove in three runs. Glaus also had three of the Cardinals' 13 hits as all of their runs scored with two outs.	"Baseball is a long year, and you're going to go through stretches where you're getting two-out knocks and you're going to go through stretches where you're not," Ankiel said.	No doubt the offense was welcomed by manager Tony La Russa, whose team scored only five runs while losing two of three in Philadelphia earlier in the week. The Cardinals were limited to two runs or fewer in six of their previous seven -- getting a combined 13 runs -- and had scored as many as six runs only once in 10 games.	"We really haven't been swinging very well, but as long as you give yourself a chance, all of a sudden that can turn," La Russa said. "It did today."	Duke was one pitch away from getting out of the third, only to be trailing 4-0 before it was over.	"I threw a pitch right down the middle [to Pujols], fell behind the next guy and I fell apart. I have to be able to take a step back ... get focused and execute pitches," Duke said. "It kind of snowballed from that point. I hung a breaking ball to Ankiel and he did what he's supposed to do with a hanging breaking ball. It's very frustrating."	Lohse didn't need much offense. He worked out of his biggest jam in the fourth, striking out Duke -- who was batting eighth -- and getting Jack Wilson on a fly ball to center after the Pirates loaded the bases with three consecutive one-out singles.	"If you let down one pitch, it's a totally different ballgame," Lohse said. "I couldn't allow myself to do that."	Lohse already has two more victories than he had while going a combined 9-12 for the Reds and Phillies last season.	Jaime Garcia, supposed to pitch in Sunday's Futures Games in New York until being called up, followed Lohse by throwing two scoreless innings in his major league debut, allowing one hit. The two-pitcher shutout was St. Louis' sixth this season.	Game notes	 Pirates pitchers have stranded six runners in two nights while hitting eighth. ... The Cardinals had no update on RHP Mark Mulder, whose season -- and career -- are in jeopardy following his latest shoulder setback. Coming off two shoulder operations, Mulder was scheduled to undergo tests Friday in St. Louis after lasting only 16 pitches Wednesday in his first start of the season. ... The crowd of 37,113 was the Pirates' second sellout in as many nights and fifth of the season. ... Going into the game, Pittsburgh had outscored St. Louis 45-25 in July. ... Duke has given up 10 earned runs and 17 hits in 8 1/3 innings over his last two starts. ... The Pirates put scheduled Saturday starter Phil Dumatrait (shoulder) on the 15-day disabled list and recalled RHP Yoslan Herrera from Double-A Altoona to start against the Cardinals. Dumatrait came off the disabled list Monday but gave up seven runs in 3 1/3 innings against Houston.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

TORONTO (AP) -- When it comes to Roy Halladay, Derek Jeter has seen enough. The New York Yankees shortstop considers his American League East rival to be the game's best starter.	Halladay threw a two-hitter and Matt Stairs and Rod Barajas homered to lead the Toronto Blue Jays to a 5-0 victory over the Yankees on Friday night.	"He never throws a ball over the middle of the plate," Jeter said of Halladay. "If you face him four or five times a game, you might get one pitch over the plate. He goes from corner to corner as good as any pitcher in the game. He's probably the best starter in baseball, I would think. I know I'm a little biased because we face him 10 times a year. He's as consistent as anyone."	Halladay (11-6) won his third straight start and threw his major league-leading seventh complete game. He struck out eight and walked one. The right-hander, who has 11 career shutouts, is 8-1 over his past 12 starts.	"That's one of the best starts I've ever caught," Barajas said. "He was remarkable."	Halladay was asked whether he feels his recent run makes him a candidate to start Tuesday's All-Star game.	"It's not high on my priority list," he said. "It's just fun to be a part of and a tremendous honor."	The Blue Jays extended their home winning streak to a season-high six games.	Playing in their third city in as many nights, the Yankees put just two runners in scoring position against Halladay. Leadoff hitter Brett Gardner was hit in the left leg with a pitch and stole second in the first, but Halladay got Jeter to ground out and struck out both Bobby Abreu and Alex Rodriguez looking to end the first. He began the second by fanning Jason Giambi and Jorge Posada.	"He was on right from the start," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "He was outstanding tonight. That's as good as I've seen him."	Jeter hit a ground-rule double in the ninth but Abreu ended a 12-pitch at-bat by striking out before Rodriguez lined out to first to end the game.	"He was dominating," Rodriguez said. "We weren't even close."	The only other hit was Rodriguez's one-out single in the fourth, a liner to center that dropped in front of Brad Wilkerson.	The Yankees managed just two other baserunners against Halladay. Robinson Cano drew a two-out walk in the second, and Abreu was hit by a pitch in the sixth, but was caught stealing to end the inning.	Yankees right-hander Joba Chamberlain lost for the first time in eight starts since joining the rotation on June 3. Chamberlain (2-3) allowed three runs and seven hits and matched season highs by striking out nine in 6 2/3 innings.	"It was impressive to see the way he got better as the game went along," catcher Posada said of Chamberlain. "He did a lot of things well. His curveball was outstanding. That's probably the best curveball I've seen from him this year."	Chamberlain, who has won just once as a starter despite never allowing more than three earned runs, was encouraged that he did not walk a batter for the first time.	"I threw all my pitches for a strike and did an OK job of pounding the zone and getting ahead early," he said. "I knew if I fell behind it was going to be a long night."	Toronto opened the scoring in the third when Adam Lind led off with a single and went to second on a wild pitch. Joe Inglett advanced him to third with a bunt and was safe at first when Posada's underhanded throw sailed over the head of Wilson Betemit at first. One out later, Lyle Overbay's single scored Lind and sent Inglett to third. Stairs followed with an RBI fielder's choice.	Barajas hit a solo homer to left in the sixth, his eighth. It was the second homer Chamberlain has allowed as a starter.	Chamberlain left after Lind reached on a bloop double that Cano lost in the twilight. Billy Traber came on and got Inglett to hit a comebacker.	Stairs made it 5-0 with a two-run homer in the eighth off Traber, his ninth.	The crowd of 43,078 was Toronto's biggest since Opening Day.	Game notes	 Girardi said the swelling in OF Johnny Damon's injured left shoulder has gone down and that his range of motion is returning. Damon is eligible to come off the 15-day DL on July 20. ... OF Hideki Matsui (left knee) hit off a tee and took part in a soft toss session for the third straight day Friday and could take batting practice Saturday. Matsui is working out at the Yankees' minor league complex in Tampa, Fla. ... Blue Jays OF Alex Rios is expected miss the weekend series. He has returned home to Puerto Rico to be with his girlfriend as she gave birth to the couple's first child. Daughter Alessandra was born Friday night. ... Toronto RHP A.J. Burnett will pitch on three days' rest in Sunday's series finale in place of RHP Dustin McGowan, who is on the 15-day DL with a sore shoulder.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

NEW YORK (AP) -- The pain rippled through Damion Easley's leg as he twisted away from an inside pitch. The New York Mets second baseman needed to take a few extra moments before stepping back in the batter's box.	Easley bought enough time so that when he saw a fastball left over the plate, he was able to turn into it just fine. His two-out solo homer in the eighth inning carried the Mets to their seventh straight win, a 2-1 victory over the Colorado Rockies on Friday night.	"At that moment, I was just trying to go back up the middle and extend the inning," Easley said of his drive to left-center on a 3-2 pitch from reliever Taylor Buchholz (3-3).	New York allowed three hits for the fourth consecutive game, the first time that's happened in franchise history.	The Rockies were left lamenting their many missed opportunities. They loaded the bases in the sixth, seventh and eighth as Mets pitchers struggled with control, walking seven of the nine batters who reached base. But Colorado couldn't get any runs out of it.	"I'll tell you what: We're looking at the wrong thing if we're focused on Buchholz right here," Rockies manager Clint Hurdle said. "We left too many men on base, too many opportunities, it never should've come down to that."	Easley has been bothered by a sore left quadriceps since early last week and will probably get to rest it Saturday. But not before he hit his third homer of the season.	The veteran has been pressed into action because of an injury to Luis Castillo. He is batting .422 over his last 13 games after going 2-for-3 with a walk Friday.	Pedro Feliciano (2-2) worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the eighth for the victory. Closer Billy Wagner had a perfect ninth for his 21st save in 27 chances. They combined with fellow relievers Aaron Heilman and Duaner Sanchez for three scoreless innings; the bullpen has not allowed a run in 13 1/3 innings.	Starter Oliver Perez has given up just two runs over his last three starts, but has two no-decisions and one victory to show for it. With an effective fastball, he gave up one run and two hits Friday, walking six and striking out seven.	Perez left after the first two batters reached in the seventh. Heilman walked the bases loaded with one out, but struck out Willy Taveras and Clint Barmes to wriggle out of the jam.	Perez didn't allow a hit through 4 2/3 innings, then lost the no-hitter and the shutout on one pitch. Brad Hawpe homered to right to give the Rockies a 1-0 lead.	Hawpe then helped the Mets get the run back in the bottom of the inning, bobbling Brian Schneider's single to right with one out. Perez moved Schneider to third, and Jose Reyes' two-out single tied the score.	Rockies All-Star Aaron Cook gave up one run in six innings but failed to become the first pitcher in franchise history to win 12 games before the break.	Teammate Matt Holliday's 14-game hitting streak ended as he went 0-for-3 with a walk. He had hit in 24 straight games against the Mets, dating to July 25, 2005.	The Mets' seven-game winning streak is their first since Aug. 17-24, 2006. Players kept talking about how relaxed they've been lately.	"It was probably a long time coming, to get that relaxed," Easley said. "It's one thing to be relaxed, like you're sitting on the couch. It's another thing to be relaxed and play with confidence. That's what we're doing right now."	Game notes	 The Mets recalled C Robinson Cancel from Triple-A New Orleans and sent down OF Chris Aguila. ... The Rockies recalled RHP Ryan Speier from Triple-A Colorado Springs and sent down LHP Cedrick Bowers. ... Mets 1B Carlos Delgado was struck in the chest by a batting practice ball hit by Schneider and immediately headed into the clubhouse. He remained in the starting lineup and said before the game he was fine. He went 1-for-4. ... Rehabbing Mets RHP Orlando Hernandez allowed two runs and three hits with five strikeouts in 5 2/3 innings with Class-A St. Lucie on Friday.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tim Redding was the beneficiary of the Nationals' biggest shutout win since the franchise moved to Washington before the 2005 season.	He definitely deserved all the support.	Redding finally got a victory after nine consecutive no-decisions, Ronnie Belliard homered twice and drove in five runs and the Washington Nationals beat the Houston Astros 10-0 Friday night.	"We needed a game like this," manager Manny Acta said. "We have so many good, supportive, patient fans I think they deserve a few nights like this one."	Redding (7-3) allowed seven singles, walked none and struck out six in six innings. The Astros had hits in the first five innings, but Redding consistently wiggled out of trouble to record his first victory since May 19 and avoid running his no-decision streak to double digits.	"It [stinks]. I wanted to go into the record book. I told my wife, some way, somehow in my career I'm going in the record book," Redding deadpanned. "Obviously, it feels good to get a win. The guys have been playing tough."	Redding fell one short of tying the major league record for consecutive no-decisions by a starting pitcher in a single season, set by San Diego's John D'Acquisto and Philadelphia's Randy Lerch in 1977, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.	A crowd of 33,653 saw the Nationals score their most runs in a shutout since a 10-0 victory by the Montreal Expos over the New York Mets on April 11, 2003.	Austin Kearns homered and Steven Shell worked three innings for his first career save as Washington earned its seventh shutout of the season, and second in three days. The Nationals had lost seven of eight.	"It's a sign that we are better than we've shown so far," Acta said.	The Astros have been blanked three times this season and have lost eight of 10 overall.	Houston starter Roy Oswalt left with a strained left hip after throwing 17 pitches during a scoreless first inning. The right-hander, who was making his first start since June 30 and had been bothered by pain in his hip, was removed in the second inning for a pinch hitter.	Houston manager Cecil Cooper said Oswalt talked his way into the game despite feeling some twinges during pregame warmups. Oswalt will be re-examined by team doctors and his next start is up in the air.	"He wanted to go out there, and we were kind of against it. He won out," Cooper said. "He wanted to go. As you can see, he got through the first inning, but he wasn't Roy. He kind of held back and it looked like his stride was a little shorter than normal. ... So we decided to not let him continue because we can't take a chance on him injuring it any further."	Asked to describe the effect of the injury, Oswalt said: "It's stimulating from my back. I think it's from my hip hurting and my back trying to take over, take a little bit of a load off my hip."	Nationals first baseman Dmitri Young left in the third with tightness in his lower back. Acta said Young is day to day.	Washington took a 2-0 lead in the second. Jesus Flores singled with one out and Belliard hit a 1-0 pitch from Chad Paronto (0-1) into the left-field stands for his eighth homer.	Belliard hit a three-run drive for career homer No. 100 in Washington's five-run fifth. Flores also had a two-run single in the inning.	"A lot of people have 700 and 500, but for me [100] feels good," Belliard said.	It was Belliard's second multihomer game of the season, and he leads the team with nine homers and 30 RBIs.	"I say unexpected because he's leading our team in home runs," Acta said. "Raise your hand if, in spring training, any of you guys would have guessed that one."	Kearns hit a two-run shot in the sixth to make it 10-0.	Game notes	 Belliard also hit two homers June 10 at Pittsburgh. ... Before the game, the Nationals optioned OF Roger Bernadina to Triple-A Columbus and selected the contract of OF Ryan Langerhans from their top farm club. ... Astros OF Carlos Lee's first-inning single was the 1,600th hit of his career. ... Kearns has eight RBIs in eight games since returning from the disabled list. ... Hall of Fame Houston broadcaster Milo Hamilton worked a game in his 57th major league stadium. He's the only broadcaster to call a game in each of the major league ballparks in Washington, D.C. -- Griffith Stadium, RFK Stadium and Nationals Park.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

MILWAUKEE (AP) -- In a game of giveaways, the Cincinnati Reds came out on top.	Jay Bruce scored a career-high three times, including the go-ahead run in the eighth inning on the third wild pitch by the Brewers, allowing Cincinnati to beat Milwaukee 6-5 on Friday night.	Rickie Weeks, Mike Cameron and Bill Hall all made an error and Manny Parra uncorked two wild pitches and Solomon Torres added the costliest one for the Brewers. The Reds had one miscue, Edwin Encarnacion's throwing error in the fourth.	"You have to [take advantage]," Bruce said. "That's how good teams stay on top, I think, and I consider us a good team. You have to take advantage of that stuff. You see it all the time. Little things hurt you the most."	Reds manager Dusty Baker was a little kinder with his assessment.	"Both sides gave each other some runs," he said. "But, we got one more run than they did."	However, the Brewers were more generous as a wild pitch in the first inning produced the Reds' first run. Weeks' fielding error set up a run in the fourth, Cameron's fielding error allowed a run to score in the seventh and then Hall's throwing error in the eighth and Torres' pitch in the dirt with the bases loaded gave the Reds the winning run.	Brewers manager Ned Yost defended his players, though.	"They're tough plays," he said. "You make them or you don't make them."	Cameron felt the same way.	"You can't see it, you can't catch it," he said.	Encarnacion hit a ground-rule double because of fan interference off Brian Shouse (3-1) to start the eighth, and he advanced when Bruce reached on a throwing error by third baseman Hall. Torres relieved and walked David Ross. Pinch-hitter Adam Dunn followed by hitting into a fielder's choice forcing Encarnacion at home. With Jerry Hairston at the plate, Bruce scored on a wild pitch.	Mike Lincoln (1-2) picked up the victory with scoreless relief in the seventh inning. Francisco Cordero, who left Milwaukee as a free agent after last season and signed with the Reds for more money, heard nothing but boos as he trotted in from the bullpen. It didn't bother him as he pitched the ninth for his 19th save in 23 chances.	The Reds chased Milwaukee starter Parra in the seventh and tied the game 5-5 with three runs on three hits, a walk and an error.	"It was probably the best I've thrown all year, in my opinion, going into the seventh," Parra said. "I don't know if I got some more adrenaline or what, but I just did not make a pitch."	Ross singled home one run and pinch-hitter Andy Phillips drove in another. Phillips scored when center fielder Cameron missed Hairston's line drive off reliever David Riske.	Hairston's sacrifice fly gave the Reds a 2-1 lead in the fifth.	Reds starter Josh Fogg left with a one-run lead and two on in the sixth, but the bullpen failed as the Brewers scored four times for a 5-2 lead.	Bill Bray relieved Fogg and struck out Prince Fielder. Corey Hart's run-scoring single chased Bray, and Gary Majewski took over only to give up Hall's run-scoring double and Cameron's RBI single.	Ken Griffey Jr.'s run-scoring groundout in the top of the first was the first run Parra had surrendered since June 23, a span of 14 innings over three appearances, including two starts. He allowed five runs -- three earned -- and six hits over 6 1/3 innings.	Fogg allowed one hit, Ryan Braun's homer in the first, over 5 1/3 innings. He struck out a season-high six and walked two in his second start since coming off the disabled list July 5 with back spasms.	Game notes	 Encarnacion tied a season high with three hits, going 3-for-4 with two doubles. ... The Brewers have homered in each of the last 11 games which is their longest streak of the season. ... A crowd of 41,229 gave the Brewers their 18th sellout of the season.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Luke Hochevar called it the best outing of his young career. He had to be at his best to beat Felix Hernandez.	Hochevar scattered five hits over seven innings and David DeJesus doubled in two runs, helping the Kansas City Royals defeat the Seattle Mariners 3-1 on Friday night.	"You could say the light came on with my approach and my pitch-ability tonight," Hochevar said.	He limited the Mariners to four singles before Adrian Beltre opened the seventh with a double. Beltre went to third on Jeremy Reed's ground out and scored on Miguel Cario's ground out to shortstop Mike Aviles for the only Seattle run.	Hochevar (6-7) struck out four and walking none -- quite an improvement over his recent outings. The first overall pick in the 2006 draft, Hochevar had allowed 15 hits and 13 earned runs in 10 innings in losing his previous two starts.	"After a couple of rough outings, the way you get your confidence back, the way you get back on the saddle is by trusting your talent," Hochevar said. "I trusted my stuff. I was aggressive in the strike zone. I think my main adjustment was pitching to both sides of the plate and moving the ball around, not staying in one location, like I did my previous start.	"The thing I'm more pleased with is the adjustment I made and what I learned from the adjustment I made. It proves to be priceless in my process of getting better every day."	Ramon Ramirez worked a scoreless eighth inning, and Joakim Soria pitched a flawless ninth to log his 25th save in 27 opportunities. Soria tied a Royals' record for saves before the All-Star break; Jeff Montgomery saved 25 games before the 1993 All-Star game.	"He's been outstanding," Royals manager Trey Hillman said. "You couldn't ask for any more from a closer."	Hernandez, making his first start since spraining his left ankle on June 23 and going on the disabled list, retired the first 10 batters he faced and struck out six of the first 13.	The Royals finally got to Hernandez (6-6) with three two-out runs in the fifth. Ross Gload singled, extending his hitting streak to nine games, and John Buck walked. Joey Gathright's single to center scored Gload, and DeJesus followed with his two-run double to right.	"First, I thought Ichiro [Suzuki] was going to run it down, but once he turned his back fully to me, I knew it was over his head," DeJesus said. "I was able just to get enough of it and get it over his head. Felix was pretty much having his way with us until that fifth inning. He hasn't pitched in a while. He might have been out of synch. Coming off the DL, he wasn't as sharp as if he was going every five days."	Hernandez allowed three runs on four hits, striking out eight and walking one, while throwing 93 pitches. He was lifted for Roy Corcoran in the sixth.	"DeJesus is a good hitter," Hernandez said. "He hit pretty good pitches and fouled them off, then he got that double. I was trying to throw more strikes and he was fouling them off. I was trying to find the way to mix my pitches. I threw a curveball, changeup, fastball, slider. He was fouling them off."	Hernandez said his ankle is fine.	"I was going crazy on the DL," he said. "I feel pumped. My mechanics were there. I could have thrown 40 more pitches."	The Mariners have lost five of their past six and have the worst record (36-57) in the American League.	"Wins are hard to come by, that's for sure," Mariners manager Jim Riggleman said. "Felix did an outstanding job and didn't look tired, but toward the end a couple of breaking balls didn't have the same bite. We didn't rally at all."	Suzuki went 0-for-4, ending his 26-game hitting streak against Kansas City. He had hit in every game he had played against the Royals before Friday.	Game notes	 Royals LF Jose Guillen was scratched from the lineup with a stiff neck. ... 2B Jose Lopez and Cario each stole second base for the Mariners. They lead the American League in stolen base percentage at 79.3 -- they've been caught 17 times while stealing 65 bases.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Most of Sean Gallagher's belongings remain in boxes and the right-hander is trying to learn the names and faces of his new teammates. He still managed to make a good first impression Friday night.	Gallagher allowed two hits over seven innings in his Oakland debut and fellow newcomer Mike Murton drove in two runs to help the A's beat the Los Angeles Angels 9-2.	Both players were acquired by Oakland earlier in the week as part of the six-player trade that sent pitchers Rich Harden and Chad Gaudin to the Chicago Cubs.	"It's been a little crazy, a little hectic," Gallagher said. "I had to pack up all my stuff in Chicago and bring it all here. I'm just trying to get acclimated to this area ... but it's been fun."	Jack Hannahan homered and drove in three runs for the A's, who sent 11 batters to the plate in the third and seven in the fourth to break the game open after Los Angeles had taken a 2-1 lead.	Relying primarily on his fastball and a baffling curve, Gallagher -- who went 3-4 in 10 starts with the Cubs -- gave up two runs in the third but little else. He didn't allow a runner past first over his final four innings and retired 14 of the final 16 batters he faced.	Gallagher struck out seven, one shy of his career high, and walked three.	"I was able to bury my breaking ball when I needed to," Gallagher said. "My last couple of starts with the Cubs I left my breaking ball up a lot. That's why I got hurt in a lot of situations. You can't do that up here. You have to be able get it down in the dirt when you need to."	Jon Garland (8-6) lasted 2 2/3 innings and gave up 10 hits and seven runs in his shortest outing since going the same distance against Seattle on Aug. 19, 2007. Three of Garland's six losses are against the A's, who are 11-4 lifetime against the right-hander.	"He had some trouble putting guys away and getting back into counts," Los Angeles manager Mike Scioscia said. "He just left some off-speed stuff that was up and he didn't get his feet on the ground and do some of the things he could do."	Andrew Brown and Dallas Braden both worked a scoreless inning for Oakland, which pulled within four games of AL West-leading Los Angeles. The teams play twice more before the All-Star break.	The nine runs were the most for the A's since they scored a season-high 15 to beat Arizona on June 17. Oakland had scored nine runs total in its previous three games.	"We just kept going," manager Bob Geren said. "Garland's a good pitcher, he's always pitched tough. A lot of times it's difficult to link something together like that but when your offense can do that it's pretty special."	It's the third time this season that Garland, who earned his 100th career win in his previous start, has given up seven earned runs.	"Everything was up," Garland said. "I got ahead of guys and didn't put them away. I fell behind and starting nitpicking. Just an overall bad game."	Murton, who was originally assigned to Triple-A Sacramento but never reported after being notified he was needed in Oakland, had only one hit in five at-bats but made it count with a two-run single off Garland. The left fielder also made two running catches near the wall.	Los Angeles entered with the best road record in the majors but fell to 3-6 in its last nine games away from home.	Chone Figgins accounted for all of the Angels' scoring when his triple drove in Erick Aybar in the third and he later scored on a sacrifice fly.	Hannahan had three hits in a game for the second time this season. Emil Brown also had three hits for the A's.	Game notes	 After the game, the Angels announced Figgins would be leaving the team on Saturday and flying to Florida to be with his father, who suffered a stroke. ... Los Angeles RHP Kelvim Escobar will have season-ending surgery to repair a torn labrum in his right shoulder. Escobar, an 18-game winner last season, has not pitched for the Angels this year. ... Angels SS Maicer Izturis did not play due to a sore right hamstring. ... Oakland SS Bobby Crosby took batting practice before the game but remains on the DL with a strained left hamstring. ... A's DH Frank Thomas took 50 swings off soft tosses and is scheduled to take live batting practice when Oakland begins the second half of the season in New York on July 18. ... DH Jack Cust struck out for the 18th straight game, tying Reggie Jackson's Oakland record for non-pitchers.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Pitching at home sure has its benefits for Jake Peavy.	The San Diego Padres' ace made quick work of the Atlanta Braves on Friday night, then hustled out as quickly as possible to catch a Toby Keith concert.	"I should have been a cowboy," quipped Peavy, a good ol' boy from Alabama. "If I get there in time, I get to see Toby sing a little bit."	Backed by a triple and double by hot-hitting Scott Hairston, Peavy led the Padres to a 4-0 win over the Braves. The reigning NL Cy Young Award winner held Atlanta to four hits and struck out seven in seven innings. He won his second straight start and for the third time in six starts since coming off a monthlong stay on the disabled list due to a swollen right elbow.	Peavy (7-5) lowered his home ERA to 1.45, the lowest in the NL and second-lowest in the majors. It was the fourth time this year he didn't allow an earned run in a home start.	"You know what? It was a good night," Peavy said.	The right-hander then praised rookie catcher Luke Carlin.	"The amount of work that he puts into it and the amount of pride he takes catching me every fifth day, I'm going to give him some props because he has sure done a nice job," Peavy said.	Manager Bud Black was impressed with Peavy.	"When he's pitching here, there's just a little different feeling," said Black, who was impressed with the life on Peavy's fastball and the curveballs he threw, including a few to Chipper Jones. "I think that you find he sets the tone on his day. You know from the time he goes out there that he's pitching with a lot of emotion. I think our guys feed off that."	Hairston agreed.	"Obviously he comes out and does his thing," Hairston said. "He's been pitching great lately. He adds fire to the game. I would say guys get motivated from that. It's encouraging to see a guy just lay it out there. I think all our pitchers do that. But there's just something about Jake.	"I'm just glad we were able to get him the run support tonight."	Atlanta's best scoring chance was in the fifth, when it had runners on second and third with one. But Brent Lillibridge grounded out and pinch-hitter Greg Norton flied out to end the threat.	"Peavy's tough," Atlanta manager Bobby Cox said. "You're not going to get a lot of runs off him, especially in this ballpark."	Said Jones: "He threw me one pitch over the middle of the plate and I fouled it off. Otherwise, everything I saw was on the black. I can't complain about the calls."	Hairston is 17-for-34 (.500) with six doubles, five homers, nine RBIs and nine runs scored in his last 11 games since June 25, hitting safely in nine of the 11 games.	Trevor Hoffman came on with runners on first and second and two outs in the ninth and struck out Lillibridge to earn his 17th save in 20 chances. He extended his big league career record to 541.	Hairston tripled into the gap in right-center off Jo-Jo Reyes leading off the first and scored on Edgar Gonzalez's groundout. He doubled with one out in the third and advanced courtesy of the Gonzalez brothers -- taking third on Edgar's single to right and scoring on Adrian's single up the middle.	The Padres added two runs in the sixth. Pinch-hitter Jody Gerut singled in Adrian Gonzalez and Kevin Kouzmanoff came around on a two-base error by left fielder Gregor Blanco.	Reyes (3-8) lost his fourth straight decision. He lasted only four innings, allowing two runs and five hits. He made his major league debut against the Padres at Petco Park just more than a year earlier.	The Braves have scored only nine runs in Reyes' eight losses.	Atlanta's Brian McCann had three hits.	Game notes	 Braves SS Yunel Escobar was scratched from the starting lineup due to a strained left shoulder. ... Kouzmanoff, San Diego's 3B, managed to catch Mark Teixeira's foul ball in the second even as he tumbled over the short wall down the left-field line. ... Padres right-hander Chris Young threw his second simulated game as he continues to work his way back from getting his nose broken when he was hit in the face by an Albert Pujols line drive on May 21. He'll begin a rehab assignment Wednesday night at Class-A Lake Elsinore and is still hoping to be back by late July or early August. "Physically I felt good, stuff was all right," Young said. "Overall, I was happy with the way things went. Hopefully it will keep going that way." ... The Padres will hold a ceremony prior to Saturday night's game to honor 20 players and coaches from the 1998 team that beat the Braves to reach the World Series. Among them will be Kevin Brown, the ace of that team. Brown was savagely booed when he returned to San Diego with the rival Los Angeles Dodgers in April 1999 after leaving the Padres to become baseball's first $100 million player. Brown might get a different reception Saturday night, considering that Petco Park probably wouldn't exist if the Padres hadn't reached the '98 World Series, where they were swept by the New York Yankees.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Chris Volstad was one out away from a complete-game shutout in his first major league start. He didn't get it, because All-Star Russell Martin singled up the middle just past the outstretched glove of shortstop Hanley Ramirez to drive in a run.	Volstad wasn't complaining after Kevin Gregg finished the Florida Marlins' 3-1 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Friday night. He even had a 3-0 lead before he took the mound, thanks to home runs by Jeremy Hermida and Jorge Cantu.	"I don't want to get greedy, but I really would have liked to have that shutout," Volstad said with a laugh. "I thought I had it. I thought that groundball was right at Hanley, but he was shading over in the hole. But obviously I'll take the win in my first start."	Volstad took a three-hitter into the ninth before giving up a leadoff single by pinch-hitter Delwyn Young, who advanced on Andre Ethier's one-out grounder and scored on Martin's hit. Gregg got the last out for his 19th save in 25 chances, getting Jeff Kent to fly out to the warning track in right field.	"We've got too much respect for Jeff Kent, and we weren't going to let him beat the young kid," manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "That's a Hall of Famer over there. Volstad did his job, so that was good enough."	Volstad (2-0) became the sixth pitcher since 1971 to get a victory as a starter and as a reliever in his first two big league appearances, joining teammate Doug Waechter, who did it with Tampa Bay in 2003. The 21-year-old right-hander was inserted into the rotation after former Dodger Mark Henderson was demoted to the bullpen with a 6.24 ERA in 19 starts.	"Volstad got a chance, but he's always been on our radar and he stayed with us in spring training almost all the way to the end," Gonzalez said. "He's got great composure and great makeup. Our concern was to get him some starts in Double-A and get him ready to come up here. Tonight he pounded the strike zone and made quality pitches. You can't ask any more from a young kid coming into Dodger Stadium. I hope we can see more of that from him."	Volstad threw two innings of scoreless relief at Colorado last Sunday, the day the Marlins promoted him from their Carolina farm club.	"That two-inning stint I had in Colorado was big," he said. "Throughout the day today, I was just trying to stay relaxed and take it easy. I knew I had some extra time because of the 7:40 start, so I slept in. Then I went in and got some food with a friend, hung out in the hotel and tried not to think about it too much. But, coming to the park, I was definitely anxious and thinking about it."	Volstad induced 13 groundball outs, including an inning-ending double-play ball in the seventh inning by Andruw Jones, who singled with two out in the fourth and was thrown out trying to steal.	The Marlins scored all of their runs against Eric Stults (2-2) after just 12 pitches by the left-hander. Ramirez, who capped his first career five-hit game on Thursday night at Dodger Stadium with a home run in the 11th inning, was hit on the left arm by Stults' third pitch and stole second on his next delivery.	Hermida then homered to right-center on a 2-0 count for his 10th of the season. Cantu followed with his 17th homer, a drive into the left-field pavilion on a 1-2 offering. It was the sixth set of back-to-back homers for the Marlins, who extended their consecutive-game home run streak to 13 games and broke the previous club record that was set last year.	Stults allowed six hits and struck out six in six innings. The two homers increased Florida's major league-leading total to 134. The Marlins hit a franchise-record 201 last year.	"I just left two fastballs out over the plate and they just did a good job of driving them," Stults said. "They're a good hitting team with a lot of young talent, and they're leading the league in home runs. So if you make mistakes, they're going to take advantage of them."	Ramirez is the only batter Stults has plunked in 30 1/3 innings over his five starts this year, and just the second in 86 2/3 career innings. He pitched 595 innings during his minor league career and hit only 11 batters.	"He wasn't crowding the plate, but I was ahead in the count, so I was trying not to go in the a strike and maybe brush him back a little bit," Stults said. "It obviously got in a little too far."	Game notes	 Organist Nancy Bea Hefley stepped aside for a moment during the seventh-inning stretch to allow 95-year-old Bob Mitchell -- the team's first organist at Dodger Stadium back in 1962 -- to perform "Take Me Out to the Ballgame." ... Cody Ross' fourth-inning single extended his career-best hitting streak to 15 games, the longest of the season by a Marlins player. ... Dodgers manager Joe Torre will rearrange his rotation coming out of the All-Star break. They'll open with Hiroki Kuroda, followed by Chad Billingsley, Derek Lowe, Chan Ho Park and Stults. ... Volstad singled just over the head of second baseman Kent in the fourth inning for his first hit in the majors.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CHICAGO (AP) -- Rich Harden left his Cubs debut to a standing ovation with Chicago ahead by seven runs. The game, however, was far from over.	Harden struck out 10 for the Cubs, who gave up two runs in the eighth and then blew a five-run lead in the ninth inning before beating the San Francisco Giants 8-7 Saturday on Reed Johnson's single in the 11th.	"It's a shame. Harden pitched really, really well, but the game got away from us a little bit in the eighth and ninth," Cubs manager Lou Piniella said. "It's a win, what can I say?"	Jim Edmonds homered and drove in four runs early for the Cubs, who led 7-0 after four innings and held on to win for the fifth time in six games. The Giants have lost six straight.	"It's disheartening to lose that way when you make a comeback like that," said Giants pitcher Brian Wilson, who took the loss.	Cubs pitcher Sean Marshall singled off Wilson (0-2) to start the bottom of the 11th. Mark DeRosa then walked, and Marshall was forced out on Mike Fontenot's bunt attempt. Johnson then laced a hit to right and DeRosa slid into home just ahead of Emmanuel Burriss' throw.	Burriss came in the game as a pinch-runner in the ninth and had never played outfielder in his professional career. His throw was perfect and Giants catcher Bengie Molina thought he tagged DeRosa for the out.	"I thought he slid right on top of my mitt," Molina said. "What can you do now? The umpire thought he saw something that I didn't see."	"A beautiful slide by DeRosa," was how Piniella saw it.	"We kind of created that situation," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "Marshall got a big hit for them, then walking a guy put us in a tough situation."	Carlos Marmol put the Cubs in bad situation as well. The talented, but continually erratic reliever was staked to a 7-2 lead in the ninth and imploded, giving up five runs -- four earned -- and five hits in one inning. He didn't talk to the media after the game.	"He won't pitch tomorrow," Piniella said. "We'll give him a good breather between now and next Friday. He can come back with a nice, fresh arm."	Piniella won't have Kerry Wood in Sunday's first-half finale either, and likely not in the All-Star Game next Tuesday. The Cubs closer, who pitched Friday, has been bothered by a blister on his right index finger. He was unavailable Saturday.	With Wood scratched, Piniella turned to Marshall (2-2), who pitched two perfect innings for the win. Marshall was shifted back to the bullpen when Harden arrived. Some thought Marshall was heading back to the minors to keep starting.	"I was glad to get in there today," Marshall said. "It was a fun win. You can't beat a win in walk-off fashion like that."	The Cubs led 7-5 with two outs and the bases loaded when pinch-hitter Eliezer Alfonzo hit a grounder wide of Ryan Theriot at shortstop. Theriot threw wildly off his back to force the runner at second, and the ball sailed into right field, allowing the tying run to score.	Theriot said he was trying to make a spectacular play.	"You want to try and make a great play for him in a situation like that," Theriot said. "Looking back on it, it wasn't a great play, but if you make a good throw, you never know."	Piniella disagreed with that kind of reasoning.	"The great play there is preventing two runs from scoring," Piniella said. "Eat the ball and hope the pitcher gets out the next hitter."	Harden, acquired from the Oakland A's in a six-player deal Tuesday, easily spotted his fastball against the weak-hitting Giants, cranking it up to 98 mph when he struck out Aurilia to end the fourth. Harden didn't allow a run and gave up five hits and walked three in 5 1/3 innings.	His velocity has been up and down this year.	"Some people were concerned," Harden said. "But I tried telling people that wasn't an issue. You have games where you're up and down. As long as I'm throwing strikes, I'm not worried."	In five career starts against the Giants, Harden is 2-0 with an 0.68 ERA. In two starts this season against San Francisco, he has 19 strikeouts in 11 1/3 scoreless innings.	Harden left with two on in the sixth to a rousing standing ovation from the crowd of 41,555.	"It's a pretty cool feeling," he said. "I've never had anything like that before, pitching in Oakland."	Theriot had three hits for the Cubs to extend his hitting streak to nine games for Chicago. It was his 37th multi-hit game this season.	Giants starter Kevin Correia avoided losing his fifth straight decision. He gave up seven runs and nine hits with four walks in 3 2/3 innings.	Game notes	 Cubs LHP Scott Eyre (strained left groin) pitched a rehab inning for Class A Peoria on Friday and will throw again Sunday. ... Giants OF Randy Winn didn't start because of a right knee contusion, but pinch-hit in the eighth. He hurt his knee in the first inning Friday. ... Giants SS Ivan Ochoa made his major league debut in the sixth, coming in on a double-switch. He doubled and scored in the ninth. ... Before the game, the Cubs collected signed memorabilia to give to a 7-year-old boy who was struck in the head by Ted Lilly's foul ball Thursday. The boy, Dominic DiAngi, fractured his skull and is recovering, but was in serious condition at a local hospital. Lilly said he was going to try and visit him Saturday. ... Piniella found out about the death of his old teammate Bobby Murcer after the game. "It's a sad day," he said. "Just a wonderful person, a great teammate and a heck of a baseball player. ... I thought he was getting better and I know the past week or 10 days, he's been struggling."	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

TORONTO (AP) -- On the day Alex Rodriguez passed Mickey Mantle on the major league home run list, the New York Yankees were left mourning Bobby Murcer -- the former star who replaced Mantle in the lineup long ago.	Rodriguez's 537th homer moved him into 13th place, and Derek Jeter hit No. 200 of his career to help the Yankees beat the Toronto Blue Jays 9-4 on Saturday.	After the game, the Yankees learned of Murcer's death due to complications from brain cancer, and players spoke fondly of a man who spent nearly four decades with the team as a player, executive and beloved broadcaster.	"It's just a reminder for all of us who are in the game, the media, and a fan of baseball just how trivial the game can be for one day," Rodriguez said. "When you look at a guy like Bobby, it makes time stop a little bit."	Murcer, who was 62, joined the Yankees in 1965 as an infielder but was soon was playing in center field, Mantle's old spot. He also took over Mantle's locker.	Rodriguez was struck by the links between Mantle and Murcer, including the fact that both were from Oklahoma.	"There's really no random events," Rodriguez said.	Rodriguez, Jeter and Brett Gardner each had three RBIs as the Yankees rebounded after being blanked 5-0 Friday night by Roy Halladay's two-hitter. New York is 5-1 following a shutout, outscoring opponents 36-16 in those games.	Rodriguez passed Mantle with a leadoff homer in the fourth, driving a 3-2 pitch from left-hander Brian Tallet off the left-field foul pole for his 19th of the season.	It was Rodriguez's 192nd home run with the Yankees, tying Tino Martinez for 15th place on the franchise list.	The three-time AL MVP has 47 career home runs against Toronto, his second-highest total against any opponent. He has hit 58 homers against the Los Angeles Angels.	Rodriguez has already passed Ted Williams (521), Willie McCovey (521) and Jimmie Foxx (534) on the career home run chart this season. Mike Schmidt (548) is next.	"These are special names," Rodriguez said. "You've got to take a step back and enjoy the moment."	A-Rod's milestone shot came three innings after Jeter led off the game with a drive to right, his fifth of the year. It was the 18th time Jeter has led off a game with a home run.	"I guess it's a lot for someone who doesn't hit home runs," Jeter said. "It's nice. You play the game long enough, you hit certain milestones. It's not something I ever thought I would do."	New York right-hander Darrell Rasner gave up four runs in the first but shut out the Blue Jays over the next four innings to win for just the second time in nine outings. He snapped a three-start losing streak.	Rasner (5-7) allowed three earned runs and seven hits. He walked one and matched a season high with six strikeouts.	"Everything felt good," Rasner said. "The fastball was down in the zone, where I needed it to be, and everything else worked off of that."	Edwar Ramirez, Jose Veras and Kyle Farnsworth each worked a hitless inning before LaTroy Hawkins wrapped it up with a 1-2-3 ninth.	Toronto's Jesse Litsch (8-6) gave up eight runs -- three earned -- and seven hits in 2 2/3 innings. The right-hander, who began the season 7-1, has won just once in his past eight outings.	"I put full blame on myself," Litsch said. "The team got a three-run lead after the first inning and I gave it back and pretty much put a dagger back in us."	Trailing 1-0 on Jeter's home run, Toronto put Rasner in an early hole by sending eight batters to the plate in the first. Marco Scutaro hit an RBI single and Adam Lind had a three-run triple.	New York jumped back in front in the second, loading the bases with a walk, a single and a hit batter. Gardner hit a run-scoring single and Jeter drove in a run when Scutaro bobbled a potential double-play grounder to second. One out later, Rodriguez hit a two-run single.	The Yankees chased Litsch with a three-run third. Robinson Cano reached on an error by shortstop John McDonald, Melky Cabrera singled and both runners advanced on a grounder before Gardner hit a two-run single and scored on Jeter's single.	The crowd of 44,363 was Toronto's biggest since opening day, surpassing Friday's crowd of 43,078.	Game notes	 Toronto's six-game home winning streak ended. ... Rodriguez tied Mantle on Sunday with a solo homer in New York's 5-4, 10-inning victory over Boston. ... DH-LF Hideki Matsui (left knee) took 55 swings at the Yankees' minor league complex in Tampa, Fla. Also working out in Tampa were RHP Phil Hughes (broken rib), who threw 25 pitches, and free-agent RHP Victor Zambrano. OF Johnny Damon (left shoulder) is scheduled to hit off a tee on Monday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DETROIT (AP) -- Brendan Harris has been swinging like a middle-of-the-order slugger over the last month. A last-minute position change was hardly enough to sway him from his routine.	Harris went 3-for-3, homered and drove in a season-best four runs Saturday to help the Twins beat Detroit for the third straight day, 6-5.	"Sometimes it's hard because you have to prepare differently," said Harris, who moved to shortstop from third after Nick Punto was a late scratch. "But I knew I was already playing. I've been swinging the bat pretty good lately and today was a good day."	The infielder, part of a six-player deal that sent pitcher Matt Garza to Tampa Bay, was hitting a paltry .232 through June 17. Since then, he's hitting .357 in 21 games with three homers and 14 RBIs.	Joe Mauer, the starting catcher for the AL All-Star team, added a two-run home run to help the Twins improve to 21-6 since June 13, the majors' best record in that span.	Harris singled in the Twins' first two runs and opened the seventh inning with a solo shot off Tigers starter Nate Robertson (6-8) that give Minnesota the lead for good.	Minnesota's Scott Baker (6-2) allowed four runs and six hits in seven-plus innings and won for the fourth time in five starts. All-Star closer Joe Nathan had three strikeouts in the ninth for his 27th save in 29 chances.	"Baker was very good and our bullpen came in and got the outs they needed to," said Twins manager Ron Gardenhire, whose team won a one-run game for the third straight day.	"It was another good win."	The victory was Minnesota's fifth straight against the Tigers. The Twins have won eight straight division games and are 27-16 against Central foes this season.	Nathan's save was his 26th in as many career chances against Detroit, the most without a blown save against one opponent among active relievers, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. The right-hander was a lot happier his team won.	"To be able to win and pitch as well as we have as a bullpen is great," he said. "It always seems like a battle when we play Detroit."	The Tigers are 4-10 against Minnesota and 13-24 against AL Central teams. Detroit manager Jim Leyland, who lamented the Tigers' offensive inconsistency before the game, found a familiar culprit.	"They did just enough and we didn't do enough. That sums up the game," he said. "We had plenty of scoring opportunties, but couldn't get the big hit."	After RBI singles by Harris in the second and fourth gave Minnesota a 2-0 lead, Matt Joyce tied the game for Detroit with his eighth homer of the season, a two-run shot that landed a few feet inside the right-field foul pole.	Down 6-2 in the eighth, the Tigers pulled to 6-5 on Curtis Granderson's two-run homer and pinch-hitter Ryan Raburn's RBI groundout. But reliever Brian Bass came on and stranded the tying run at third when he induced an inning-ending grounder by Marcus Thames.	Robertson allowed five runs and 10 hits in seven innings. He hasn't won since June 21.	"We're in a tough spot right now," the lefty said. "There's plenty of baseball left but we just aren't doing enough right now."	Game notes	 The Twins scratched Punto (strained left ring finger) from the lineup shortly before the start of the game. The club said the injury is not serious. ... Leyland said he expects OF Magglio Ordonez (oblique) and SS Edgar Renteria (hamstring) to be ready to play when the Tigers resume the season Thursday at Baltimore. ... Twins OF Carlos Gomez ended an 0-for-21 streak with a fifth-inning single.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

NEW YORK (AP) -- Pedro Martinez couldn't remember the last time he didn't get his way.	Turns out Jerry Manuel can be just as stubborn.	The Mets manager pulled Martinez after four innings on Saturday because of tightness in his right shoulder, but New York's resilient relievers held the Colorado Rockies without a hit the rest of the way in a 3-0 victory.	"He wanted to go back in the game," Manuel said. "He fought, fought, fought, fought to go back out there and pitch, but I said, 'No."	Why risk it?	The bullpen has gone 18 1/3 innings without allowing a run, and the one-hitter made the Mets the first team in modern baseball history to allow three hits or less in five consecutive games, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.	Jose Reyes homered and Fernando Tatis and Brian Schneider also drove in runs for the Mets (50-44), who have won eight straight for the first time since June 7-15, 2006. They're a season-best six games over .500 and moved within a half-game of Philadelphia in the NL East, after the Phillies lost 10-4 to the Arizona Diamondbacks.	"It feels good," Reyes said. "We're playing together as a team, we've got a lot of communication. That's why we've been successful."	Carlos Muniz (1-1) pitched two innings for his first career win, Aaron Heilman and Scott Schoeneweis went an inning each, and Billy Wagner worked a perfect ninth to wrap up the Mets' 17th win in 19 games against the Rockies at Shea Stadium.	It was Wagner's 22nd save in 28 chances.	"When you use that many guys and they come in and get crisp, clean innings, it's quite a compliment to what we're doing here," Manuel said.	Martinez cruised through the first three innings without allowing a hit before walking Matt Holliday on five pitches. He began stretching and flexing his shoulders, and Manuel and a trainer went out to the mound immediately.	Martinez stayed in the game and Brad Hawpe singled for the Rockies' only hit, but Chris Iannetta grounded into a double play to end the inning.	The three-time Cy Young Award winner said he's had a sore groin that caused his stride to be off, putting pressure on his surgically repaired right shoulder. He lobbied to stay in the game but, with the All-Star break coming up, Manuel wasn't having it.	"Don't mistake Jerry," Martinez said. "He can be tough, he can be tough -- even with an old goat like me."	The Rockies have dropped five of seven since a season-best five-game winning streak, mostly because they can't score runs. The defending NL champs managed only five base runners a day after blowing bases-loaded chances three straight innings in a 2-1 loss.	"We didn't really get anything going at any particular point in time," Rockies manager Clint Hurdle said. "The walks were our best play."	The offensive ineptitude squandered a second consecutive serviceable start by Ubaldo Jimenez (4-9), who constantly challenged the Mets with a 98-mph fastball.	Fresh off his first road win in 12 starts, Jimenez needed just seven pitches to get through the first inning and didn't allow a hit until Carlos Beltran doubled in the fourth. Beltran stole third and scored on a base hit by Tatis.	Reyes homered to deep right-center leading off the fifth, his 10th of the year, and the Mets made it 3-0 in the sixth when Carlos Delgado reached on a base hit and Schneider slipped a double past first baseman Jeff Baker down the line.	After going a career-high eight innings to beat Martinez the last time he faced the Mets, Jimenez gave up seven hits over six innings. He struck out eight.	"I pitched good but it felt like I could do better," Jimenez said. "I had a couple situations that I got myself in trouble trying to throw too hard."	Game notes	Argenis Reyes stole his first career base in the fifth inning. The Mets were 4-for-4 stealing against Iannetta. ... The one-hitter was the 33rd in Mets history. ... Mets OF Angel Pagan (shoulder), rehabbing at Class A St. Lucie, could be back after the All-Star break, general manager Omar Minaya said. ... Mets 2B Damion Easley, who hit the go-ahead homer in the eighth inning Friday night, was out of the lineup to rest a sore quad. ... Rockies OF Willy Taveras was out of the starting lineup to rest his ailing quad. He pinch hit in the eighth inning and flied out to center.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) --  Randy Johnson liked the results of his fourth-inning at-bat. How he felt about his technique, well, that's another matter.	Johnson helped secure his 290th victory with a two-run double to start an eight-run fourth inning, and the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the Philadelphia Phillies 10-4 Saturday.	"Watching me hit and run is like watching Manute Bol shoot a 3-pointer; it's not a pleasant sight," Johnson said.	A career .125 hitter, Johnson (6-7) laced a double to the left-field wall in the fourth inning to give Arizona a 4-2 lead. The Diamondbacks went on to match a club record for runs in an inning. In 573 career at-bats, Johnson now has 15 extra-base hits -- 14 of which are doubles.	"You've got to be able to help yourself and put the ball in play. It helped and, more importantly, it got us going a little bit," Johnson said of his double, which came on a 3-2 fastball. "Every once in a while I'm lucky enough to put the ball in play. I take pride in it."	Johnson's trip around the bases caused a cramp in his calf that forced him to leave the game after warming up in the seventh inning. The 44-year-old Johnson departed after allowing four runs on five hits while striking out three and walking one.	"His base-running escapades took something out of him," Arizona manager Bob Melvin said, adding that the calf injury isn't serious. "But I was impressed [with the double]. He was grinding through the at-bat and finally got a ball that he could handle."	Mark Reynolds' three-run homer to left-center capped the inning that saw eight Diamondbacks score and every batter reach base. Arizona scored all eight runs with two outs.	"Eight runs is a luxury and the only bad thing is you don't want to have your focus derailed," Johnson said.	Except for Philadelphia's Shane Victorino, there wasn't much that derailed Johnson.	Victorino had three of the Phillies' five hits, going 3-for-3 with two homers. It was Victorino's first career multihomer game and all of his hits came off Johnson.	Phillies starter Adam Eaton (3-8) allowed eight runs on seven hits, failing to reach the fourth inning for the second straight start. Eaton has allowed 16 runs on 17 hits in 6 1/3 innings in his last two outings.	"The last two starts I would like to forget and move on," said Eaton, whose ERA increased to 5.71. "My ERA is brutal; either I'm good or horrendous."	Eaton said failing to get Johnson out was the turning point of the game, but said he'd take the same approach next time.	"He's not the strongest hitter by any means," Easton said. "I like my chances going eight or nine pitches and getting him out."	Philadelphia manager Charlie Manuel added: "The game was the fourth inning. We had two outs and then [Eaton] was scuffling to get out of the inning. Johnson's hit was a big hit. He didn't want to walk him and went right after him. He just couldn't get that last out."	Philadelphia's Ryan Howard went 0-for-4, ending his 14-game hitting streak.	Chad Tracy went 3-for-5 for Arizona and Stephen Drew and Conor Jackson added a pair of hits for the Diamondbacks.	Game notes	 Phillies All-Star second baseman Chase Utley, 0-for-9 with four strikeouts against Johnson, was left out of the starting lineup for the second time this season. Eric Bruntlett started for Utley and went 1-for-3 with a double. The Diamondbacks now have scored eight runs in an inning five times, the last coming on April 25, 2002, in the fifth inning against Atlanta. Phillies LF Pat Burrell had his on-base streak snapped at 17 games. Burrell went 0-for-3 with a strikeout against Johnson, giving him 15 strikeouts in 25 career at-bats against the Arizona left-hander.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BOSTON (AP) -- Red Sox manager Terry Francona thinks he might be seeing Tim Wakefield at his best -- strong words, considering the knuckleballer won 14 of his first 15 starts in Boston.	That was back in 1995, long before the soon-to-be 42-year-old righty became a mainstay of the Red Sox rotation.	"Everything's been clicking for me," Wakefield said after pitching seven innings of two-hit ball to take advantage of another offensive outburst and beat Baltimore 12-1 on Saturday night. "I don't want to change anything. I've been on a run and hopefully I can keep doing that."	Kevin Youkilis' first career grand slam helped him tally his first six-RBI game, and J.D. Drew and Manny Ramirez homered on consecutive pitches in the first inning to stake Wakefield (6-6) to an early lead. He responded by retiring the last 13 batters he faced before leaving after seven -- the eighth time in nine starts he's gone that far.	"I think that's actually the best I've seen him pitch," said Francona, who had to leave Wakefield off the World Series roster last fall because of lingering back and shoulder problems. "He worked hard to stay where he is. When last year ended, and he wasn't able to pitch, it was very important to him to come back and take the ball when it's his turn."	Youkilis, who had four RBIs in Boston's 18-5 victory over Minnesota on Wednesday, homered in the third when the Red Sox scored seven times to chase Radhames Liz (3-2). Youkilis also added a sacrifice fly in the fourth and a run-scoring infield single in the eighth.	Wakefield went at least seven innings in seven straight games before lasting 6 1/3 last Sunday. But he had just two wins to show for the streak, with three losses in which the Red Sox scored a total of five runs and two no-decisions when the bullpen blew the lead.	"I was the beneficiary of a lot of runs scored tonight," Wakefield said. "So that made my job a lot easier after the third inning."	He walked Adam Jones with one out in the third and didn't allow another base runner. Jones went to second on a passed ball -- the only base runner besides Ramon Hernandez, who hit a solo homer, to get that far against the Boston starter.	"He's the most underrated pitcher I think there is in the big leagues," former teammate Kevin Millar said. "You've just got to stop the bleeding. We were down by a lot of runs early and Wakefield was throwing strikes."	Liz, who allowed eight runs in 2 1/3 innings, has given up 12 earned runs in six innings over two starts since starting the season 3-0. He also walked three and hit a batter, all in the third inning when the Red Sox scored as many runs to support Wakefield as they had in his six losses this season combined.	"He walked three guys, hit a guy, and the wheels were off the wagon after that," said Orioles manager Dave Trembley, who was ejected for arguing a called third strike against Millar to end the top of the seventh. "It just seems like once he gets in trouble he can't get himself out of it."	Dustin Pedroia singled with one out, then Drew walked, Ramirez was hit by a pitch and Mike Lowell drew a run-scoring walk. Youkilis followed with his 15th homer, a shot high into the seats above the Green Monster that made it 7-1.	Sean Casey walked to end Liz's night, then Lance Cormier gave up singles to Kevin Cash and Jacoby Ellsbury before Pedroia hit a two-run double to give Boston a 9-1 lead.	Nick Markakis doubled off Mike Timlin in the ninth for the third hit by the Orioles, who had lost five in a row before beating Boston 7-3 in the series opener on Friday.

CLEVELAND (AP) -- Tampa Bay's latest loss was Matt Ginter's first big league win in more than four years.	The good news for the Rays is they finally score some runs in Cleveland.	Ginter pitched five-hit ball for five innings, Ryan Garko got his first extra-base hit in more than a month and had five RBIs and the Indians handed Tampa Bay its season-	high sixth straight loss Saturday night, 8-4.	Tampa Bay has seen its AL East lead of five games dwindle to a half game over Boston.	The Rays were scoreless for 22 innings over three games in Cleveland until Cliff Floyd delivered a two-run single with two outs in the eighth inning off reliever Juan Rincon. All-Star Dioner Navarro doubled home two more off Masa Kobayashi to make it 7-4.	"Hopefully, that [rally] breaks it open for tomorrow," Rays manager Joe Maddon said. "We had the fight to come back."	All-Star Grady Sizemore hit his AL-leading 23rd homer for Cleveland, which has dominated the Rays at home since they dropped two of three games to Tampa Bay to fall out of the 2005 AL Central race. Tampa Bay is 0-12 at Progressive Field since then.	Ginter (1-0) had not pitched in the majors since a week before that series against the then Devil Rays. The right-hander's contract was purchased by the Indians from their Triple-A affiliate in Buffalo on Saturday. Cleveland needed a starter to take the rotation spot vacated by CC Sabathia, who was traded to Milwaukee on Monday for four prospects.	"It was just a great effort," Indians manager Eric Wedge said of the 30-year-old, who was 6-6 with a 4.14 ERA at Buffalo. "He's been throwing the ball very well the last month. Tonight, he used all his pitches."	Ginter, 5-2 over his last 10 starts in the minors, did not walk a batter. He also tied a career high with five strikeouts in his first big league start since Sept. 18, 2005, for Detroit. He last won with the New York Mets on May 21, 2004, and hadn't beaten an AL club since a win at Cleveland on July 26, 2001, for the Chicago White Sox.	"You've got a uniform on, you've got a chance," Ginter said of his long wait to get back to the bigs. "I left 17 tickets for family and friends and it was rewarding to do well."	Garko snapped a 9-for-61 (.148) slump with a two-run homer in the second and three-run double in the third off Matt Garza (7-5).	With two outs and David Dellucci on first after a single, Garko hit a high fastball over the center of the plate into the left-field seats for his seventh homer.	"Garza's got a good sinker and you have to take advantage of a mistake because he doesn't make many," Garko said of his first extra-base hit in 82 at-bats since a three-run homer at Detroit on June 9.	Garko didn't play in the first two games against the Rays.	"I didn't just sit around reading magazines," the first baseman said. "I put in a lot of work with [hitting coach] Derek Shelton. I had hit some line drives even before that, but they went right at somebody. It feels good to finally get some results."	Franklin Gutierrez then singled for his first hit since June 15, breaking an 0-for-32 streak. He scored on Sizemore's homer to center for a 4-0 lead.	Singles by Jhonny Peralta, Casey Blake and Dellucci loaded the bases to open the third. With one out, Garko sent a blooper to right-center that fell for a three-run double. Both Gabe Gross in center and Eric Hinske in right dived for the ball, which bounced between them as they slid along the grass, still moist from a mid-afternoon rain.	Tampa Bay must win Sunday to complete the first half with the majors' best record at the All-Star break after having the worst record a year ago.	"Collectively, we're not getting it done," Floyd said. "Hopefully, this is a good learning experience for us."	The Rays could become the fourth team to be in first place at the break a year after having the worst overall record. Philadelphia and the Chicago Cubs did it in 2001, as did the 1989 Baltimore Orioles.	"I'm not worried about the break," Maddon said. "It would be nice to get a win before it."	Game notes	 3B Evan Longoria was the only right-handed hitter to start for the Rays. OF B.J. Upton, in a 7-for-34 slump, was rested. "I think he's pressing a bit," Maddon said. ... Peralta is batting .354 (35-for-99) with 20 RBIs in his last 24 games. ... Francisco went 2-for-2 with three walks and has hit .556 (10-for-18) with five RBIs in his last five games. ... Rays RHP Troy Percival (strained left hamstring) threw 26 pitches off the mound Saturday. ... Rays RHP Al Reyes (shoulder tendinitis) is scheduled to pitch on a minor-league rehab assignment both Sunday and Monday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Edinson Volquez is at the top of his game heading into All-Star week.	Cincinnati's lone representative for Tuesday's festivities at Yankee Stadium, Volquez struck out 10 in seven sharp innings to lead the Reds past the Milwaukee Brewers 8-2 on Saturday night.	Volquez (12-3) lowered his NL-leading ERA to 2.29 and made a strong case to earn starting honors for the National League in New York.	"Edinson was outstanding," Reds manager Dusty Baker said. "I wanted him to go there on a high, on a positive. He's going there with quite a few pitches. Two days' rest, that's not very long, so we'll see.	"I wouldn't mind if he started the game and just pitched only one inning."	Adam Dunn homered twice in Cincinnati's seventh victory in nine games, and Milwaukee dropped to 2-4 since acquiring CC Sabathia in a trade with Cleveland on Monday. Sabathia makes his second start Sunday for the Brewers, who fell six games behind the first-place Chicago Cubs in the NL Central.	Volquez gave up six hits and two runs, one earned. The right-hander walked two in his fourth double-digit strikeout game this season.	"I think it was one of the great nights for me," said Volquez, who threw 114 pitches. "All my pitches were there tonight. This is my No. 12. It's what I was looking for before the All-Star game."	Seth McClung (5-5) took the loss despite striking out a season-high seven. He gave up three hits and three runs -- all on Dunn's first-inning shot. Jerry Hairston Jr. singled, Ken Griffey Jr. walked and Dunn hit his 25th homer with two outs.	Dunn and Edwin Encarnacion then went back-to-back in the ninth inning off Eric Gagne, drawing boos from the crowd for the former Brewers closer. More boos followed as Gagne was removed from the game after giving up a two-out single to Corey Patterson and a double to Hairston. Both scored on a single by Jay Bruce off Guillermo Mota.	Dunn, with five homers in six games and eight in his last 13, moved into second in the NL in homers behind Philadelphia's Ryan Howard (28).	"I go on these ruts where I can't swing -- I take pitches that I should be hitting," Dunn said. "Right now I'm in one of those things where it's the opposite. I am swinging at pitches I should be swinging at, seeing the ball pretty good and getting some good results."	Baker said Dunn is being more aggressive.	"He's centering balls, not fouling off balls sometimes like he does to put himself in the hole," Baker said. "Maybe a day off yesterday helped him, too. Just keep it coming. What does he have, 26 home runs? That's Big Dunn. We've still got a lot of games to play, so he's still got a lot of damage to do."	Milwaukee's two runs came on Prince Fielder's homer in the fourth, his 18th and only the fifth home run Volquez has given up this year. Fielder apparently didn't know it was gone, however, as he stood in the batter's box for a couple of seconds, looking up and down trying to find the ball as it headed toward the Brewers' bullpen in left.	"I think I had everything under control after that," Volquez said. "They hit a home run, but it didn't bother me."	Volquez got out of a jam in the fifth thanks to some great defense. McClung and Craig Counsell singled with one out and, following J.J. Hardy's strikeout, Ryan Braun lined a shot down the third-base line.	Encarnacion stopped it with a dive, saving a run even though he stumbled and couldn't force McClung at third. Fielder grounded out to end the threat.	"I think Encarnacion's play was huge," Counsell said. "That's two runs right there, and that gives us the lead. That was the play of the game to me. He didn't get an out, but it's two runs that were saved."	Two runs that could have gotten McClung a win.	"He pitched great," Brewers manager Ned Yost said. "He just kind of threw a rolling breaking ball in the first inning to Dunn, and besides that he buckled down and did a really nice job."	Just not quite as good as Volquez.	"He's the real deal," Yost said.	Game notes	 The Reds are expected to place RHP Aaron Harang on the 15-day disabled list Sunday because of a strained right forearm. The Reds will recall top prospect Homer Bailey from Triple-A Louisville to start against the Brewers. Harang's placement on the DL will be retroactive to Wednesday, and he would be eligible to come back on July 23. ... A tough scoring call from Friday's game was overturned Saturday. Hairston was awarded a triple for a ball that Brewers CF Mike Cameron lost in the lights. It had been ruled an error, and Yost and others disagreed with the call following the game.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- John Danks came home and gave about 40 family and friends quite a show. The Chicago White Sox left-hander also showed Texas fans what they're missing.	Danks, the Texas native who was once the Rangers' top pitching prospect, struck out eight with no walks in 7 2/3 solid innings Saturday night and the AL Central-leading White Sox held on after he left to beat Texas 9-7.	"Getting a win against the Rangers is the same as beating another team," Danks insisted. "I tried to approach it like any other game and I think I did that."	Danks (7-4) retired 14 straight batters -- and was thinking about the possibility of his first complete game in the majors -- before giving up consecutive doubles to German Duran and Ian Kinsler in the eighth. Danks left after starting All-Star outfielder Josh Hamilton's second RBI single got the Rangers within 8-4.	"I feel like I got ahead of myself a little bit," Danks said, still smiling.	It was still an impressive outing for the 23-year-old lefty, the ninth overall pick by the Rangers in the 2003 draft. Texas traded him to Chicago in December 2006 in a five-player deal that sent Brandon McCarthy to the Rangers. Danks earned a spot in the White Sox rotation the following spring.	"He was very good," said Kinsler, the AL's top hitter (.333) whose double extended his hitting streak to 24 games, longest in the majors this season.	"Obviously having people here, I wanted to perform well," Danks said. "But as far as extra nerves being here in Texas, there wasn't anything like that."	Jim Thome and Paul Konerko hit back-to-back homers in the eighth for Chicago, which maintained its 1½-game division lead over Minnesota. Thome, who finished with four RBIs, hit a two-run shot for his 525th career homer before Konerko capped his 4-for-4 night with his homer.	Danks allowed more than two earned runs for the first time in six starts. But he is 4-0 his last nine starts, since allowing two runs over five innings in a loss to the Los Angeles Angels on May 24.	"It was important for him. He needed a game like that to keep his confidence going," manager Ozzie Guillen said. "Awesome. Great performance. To see a kid perform like that is good."	Hamilton upped his majors-leading RBI total to 95 with his fifth consecutive multi-RBI game. He has driven in runs in eight straight.	After Hamilton's RBI single with two outs in the third, Danks didn't allow another base runner until Duran doubled. Danks left after Hamilton singled home Young.	McCarthy was also on the mound Saturday, throwing 25 pitches in a simulated game at the Rangers' spring training complex in Arizona. McCarthy has been on the disabled list all season (right forearm inflammation) after going 5-10 with two DL stints last year.	The Rangers have used 12 different starting pitchers this season, and 26 pitchers total.	Millwood, his start pushed back a day because of a sore left groin, allowed five runs and 10 hits with four walks. The White Sox stranded nine runners the first five innings, leaving the bases loaded twice against the right-hander.	"Physically, everything feels as good as it should," Millwood said. "I walked too many guys. ... I'd rather give up a hit than a walk. Adding the two together, it makes it that much worse."	Konerko, who had been 2-for-15 with seven strikeouts since coming off the disabled list Tuesday from a strained oblique muscle, had an RBI single in the third to tie the game 1-1, and his ninth homer made it 8-2. Thome had a sacrifice fly in the fifth after Jermaine Dye snapped a 2-for-20 slump with a triple, and Thome added an RBI double in the sixth.	Milton Bradley, the All-Star DH who hadn't started the previous three games because a sore left knee, led off the Texas second with his 18th homer, a 429-foot shot.	Game notes	 Hamilton's streak of eight straight games with an RBI is the longest in the AL this season. Philadelphia's Chase Utley had a nine-game streak this season. ... Pitching coach Mark Connor said McCarthy "threw well with no problems." The Rangers don't anticipate having McCarthy back before at least mid-August. ... It was 100 degrees when the game started just after 6 p.m. It was the first triple-digit temperature at first pitch in Arlington this season.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The St. Louis Cardinals should know this by now: No late-inning lead is safe against the Pittsburgh Pirates, especially with Jason Michaels at bat. Not even a lead this big.	Michaels hit a two-run homer in the 10th inning, the Pirates' third big homer in three innings, and Pittsburgh rallied from six runs down in the eighth to beat the St. Louis Cardinals 12-11 Saturday night.	"What a game," the Pirates' Adam LaRoche said. "You don't see games like that very often."	The Cardinals appeared to be cruising with a season-high 22 hits while taking leads of 9-3 in the seventh and 10-4 in the eighth, but Jason Bay hit his second two-run homer of the night in the eighth.	The Pirates tied it with four runs in the ninth on Nate McLouth's three-run shot off Jason Isringhausen and Bay's fifth RBI, on a force-play grounder.	"We're still up by one [after McLouth's homer], but we couldn't get it done," Isringhausen said. "It didn't seem like it mattered what we threw up, they got a hit or something weird happened."	Troy Glaus homered leading off the 10th for St. Louis' 10th extra-base hit, but the Cardinals' unreliable bullpen couldn't hold this lead, either. Cardinals relievers have lost 20 games and lead the majors with 22 blown saves.	"It was one of the more amazing games I've ever been involved in," Bay said. "That was something I'll never forget. Early on, it kind of felt like we were down by 10. You get a hit here, a homer, and you say, 'OK, OK, we've got some momentum' and that's when you start to feel it. Nate comes up and, boom, that puts you within one run."	The Cardinals outhit the Pirates 22-13 but left 12 on base.	"It's one of those games that got away, but the Pirates have done it to us a couple, three times," manager Tony La Russa said. "We know they're going to play nine innings -- and 10."	The Pirates are five games under .500 at 44-49, but are 10-3 in extra innings with eight consecutive victories, a streak that began when they rallied to win 8-4 at St. Louis in 10 innings on May 13. Michaels hit a grand slam in St. Louis to cap a comeback from a 4-0 deficit as the Pirates won 5-4 on June 2.	"But this is definitely No. 1," Michaels said. "I've never had a walk-off homer. That was awesome."	Raul Chavez singled to start the Pirates' 10th against Kyle McClellan, who was lifted for rookie Chris Perez (2-1). Michaels, who entered the game as a pinch-hitter in the ninth and drew a key walk ahead of McLouth's homer, followed a batter later with a drive into the left-center seats for his fourth homer.	Denny Bautista (3-1) got the victory despite allowing Glaus' 14th homer. Glaus went 4-for-4 and reached base six times, walking twice.	The Cardinals fell 5½ games behind NL Central leader Chicago despite totaling 17 runs and 35 hits in the first two games of the three-game series. They had scored more than two runs only once in their previous seven, getting outscored 32-13 while losing five of those seven.	Offense wasn't the Cardinals' problem as NL All-Star Ludwick went 3-for-5 with four RBIs, Albert Pujols and Rick Ankiel each doubled twice and Yadier Molina went 4-for-6, giving him six hits in two nights and raising his average to .313.	The Cardinals easily topped the 16 hits they had several times previously this season.	"It's unfortunate we got beat in a game we scored [11] runs," La Russa said. "Today we scored but we couldn't pitch."	The Pirates' rally cost Todd Wellemeyer his first victory since June 5 after he allowed four runs in 6 1/3 innings. He hadn't lasted past the fifth inning in his previous four starts.	Much of the Cardinals' big night came against right-hander Yoslan Herrera, a former Cuban national pitcher who was recalled from Double-A Altoona. He yielded 11 hits and six runs in 4 1/3 innings in his major league debut.	Herrera signed a $1.92 million, three-year contract before the 2007 season, but had not pitched in the majors until Saturday.	Bay's two-run drive in the first gave Herrera a 2-0 lead, but he quickly gave it back by allowing six hits in a span of nine batters as St. Louis scored three times in the third and twice in the fourth.	Pirates third baseman Doug Mientkiewicz was ejected by umpire Eric Cooper in the fourth for running across the infield to argue that Pujols was out at second on a double down the line that eluded Mientkiewicz. The Pirates trailed 5-2 at the time.	Game notes	 Ankiel is 11-for-28 (.393) with eight RBIs in seven games but was lifted after turning his left ankle while batting in the seventh. The injury isn't believed to be serious, and he was removed mostly for precautionary reasons. ... Wellemeyer, batting eighth as La Russa does with his pitchers, had a sacrifice bunt but left six runners on base while going 0-for-3. ... It could have been worse for Herrera: The Cardinals failed to score despite having the bases loaded with none out in the second.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Mark Grudzielanek's milestone hit was a faded memory by the time David DeJesus did what no Royals player had done in more than three years.	DeJesus hit a two-run homer with two out in the ninth and the Kansas City Royals rallied for a 5-4 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Saturday night.	Mariners closer Brandon Morrow (1-2) retired the first two batters in the ninth before walking pinch-hitter Billy Butler on four pitches. DeJesus hit Morrow's next pitch, a fastball in, just over the right-field fence and into the Royals' bullpen.	"I kind of fist-pumped a little too early," DeJesus said. "I saw Ichiro [Suzuki] go back to the wall and I was like, 'oh geez, its not going to leave.' Then it went out and I was like, all right."	DeJesus' game-ending homer was the first by a Royal since Alberto Castillo on April 19, 2005, against Cleveland.	"That was my first ever walk-off hit of any kind at any level," DeJesus said. "Once I got in there the guys were punching and banging the heck out of me. It was fun seeing all those guys around home plate. It was pretty cool."	Six innings earlier, Grudzielanek had the second of his two hits to become the 18th active player with 2,000 hits. He was the 251st to reach the milestone in big league history.	"That's just icing on the cake with David's two-run shot in the bottom of the ninth," Grudzielanek said. "You dream about that as a kid, hitting a home run to win the game. Coming on a night that's very personal and very special to me."	Manager Trey Hillman said he predicted DeJesus' home run.	"That's one I actually called I said to Dave, 'We've got two outs. How about Billy drawing a walk and then you going boom?'" Hillman said. "Fortunately, it happened. That's good for us.	Morrow has blown saves in his past two opportunities, giving up four runs on three home runs.	"That was a fastball down the middle that I have gotten away with plenty of times before," Morrow said. "The walk really hurt."	Mariners manager Jim Riggleman agreed.	"The walk to Butler was crucial. He didn't bite on a couple of breaking balls that were very close. Once he gets to 2-0, he can now be very selective. He never got a strike and he took ball four. That was key because we were facing the bottom part of the lineup with a great arm. Now we're facing the top of the lineup. DeJesus got him. There's not much more you can say about it."	Left-hander Horacio Ramirez (1-0), who was with the Mariners last year, pitched 2 1-3 perfect innings of relief for the win.	Mariners starter Jarrod Washburn held the Royals to three runs -- one earned -- and seven singles over six innings. In his past seven starts, Washburn is 3-1 with a 2.58 ERA. He has allowed two earned runs or less in six of his past seven starts to lower his ERA from 6.56 to 4.83.	Royals starter Gil Meche was staked to a 3-0 lead and held his former team to four singles through five innings. But he ran into trouble in the sixth.	Suzuki led off with a single and with one out, Raul Ibanez crushed Meche's 2-0 pitch for his 11th home run. Ibanez had been 1-for-15 against the Royals this season before the home run.	After the home run, Jose Vidro and Adrian Beltre singled and Jeremy Reed drove them both in with a double to left to make it 4-3.	"I would have been really upset if we hadn't won this game after Grud's 2,000th hit," Meche said. "I'm just glad we won this game for him and the team. I made some mistakes and before I could blink four runs scored and they had the lead."	Meche gave up four runs and 10 hits in 6 2/3 innings.	Game notes	 Tug Hulett, the son of former major leaguer Tim Hulett, made his big league debut as the Mariners designated hitter and singled in the fifth for his first hit. ... Royals DH Jose Guillen returned to the Royals lineup and went 1-for-4 after missing the game Friday night due to a stiff neck.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A night after getting shut out, the Houston Astros got their offense going.	Hunter Pence homered and drove in three runs to help the Astros beat the Washington Nationals 6-4 on Saturday night.	"Nothing was running for us yesterday, and today, it seemed to happen," Pence said. "It's baseball. The ball seemed to bounce in different ways. We had a lot of energy, we played hard and everyone chipped in."	Lance Berkman added two RBIs and Carlos Lee had three of the Astros' 13 hits. Houston has won just three of its last 11 games.	"Everything looks great when you score six runs and win the ballgame," Berkman added. "When you get shut out 10-0, it doesn't look the same. Certainly, winning covers a multitude of evils and makes you look good."	Left-hander Wandy Rodriguez (4-3), who had only one victory in his previous six starts, allowed four runs and eight hits over 5 1/3 innings to earn the win. He walked one and struck out one. Jose Valverde worked the ninth for his 24th save in 29 tries.	"Wandy ... limited the damage," Houston manager Cecil Cooper said. "He didn't give them any crooked numbers. He threw some double play balls. That's what you have to do to prevent teams from putting crooked numbers up on you."	Washington rookie Collin Balester (1-2) gave up six runs -- four earned -- and 11 hits in 4 2/3 innings.	"You learn from failure and I'm starting to learn a lot more. The next start's going to be a lot better," Balester said.	Willie Harris homered for Washington, which has lost nine of 12 games. The Nationals hit into four double plays, matching a season high.	Pence's 12th homer of the season erased a 2-1 deficit in the fourth. The Astros sent nine men to the plate in fifth, chasing Balester, and a throwing error by third baseman Ronnie Belliard opened the floodgates.	"We had our chances. We just played poor defense," Washington manager Manny Acta said. "I think with the offense we have we can't afford to be giving 30 outs to the opposition."	Leadoff hitter Darin Erstad reached on Belliard's wild throw and went to third on Kaz Matsui's double to right. Berkman made it 5-2 with a double to the bullpen wall in left-center. Lee singled and, two outs later, Pence capped the uprising with an RBI single to left.	Houston strung together three consecutive singles with one out in the first, taking a 1-0 lead on Lee's RBI hit to left.	A sacrifice fly by Cristian Guzman tied the game in the bottom of the inning and Belliard led off the second with a double, then scored on Jesus Flores' single to center.	Rodriguez tired in the sixth, when he could retire only one batter and left after loading the bases.	Harris' fifth homer, a leadoff shot to right-center off a 1-2 Rodriguez pitch, made it 6-3. Paul Lo Duca singled, Guzman drew a one out walk and Belliard singled before Chris Sampson relieved. Sampson plunked Flores on the left arm with his first pitch, forcing in a run, then got Wily Mo Pena to bounce into an inning-ending 1-2-3 double play.	"That was the at-bat that probably disinflated us. It took all the air out of us right there," Acta said. "[Pena] chased a pitch low and out of the zone in that situation and made their night, basically. ... Right now, he's just lost at the plate."	Game notes	 Houston is 10-1 when Pence drives in two or more runs. ... Washington 3B Ryan Zimmerman, on the 15-day disabled list with a turn muscle in his left shoulder, will begin a rehabilitation assignment with Single-A Potomac in Salem, Va., on Monday. If all goes well, Zimmerman will move on to Triple-A Columbus and play Thursday through Sunday. ... Balester got his first major league hit, a third-inning single. ... Houston signed its first-round draft pick, C Jason Castro from Stanford. He will begin his professional career at Single-A Tri-City. ... Nationals 1B Dmitri Young missed the game with back tightness.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Ervin Santana refuses to even think about his dominance over Oakland. The first-time All-Star keeps his focus on winning.	Ervin Santana allowed five hits over seven scoreless innings, Howie Kendrick had two hits and an RBI, and the Los Angeles Angels beat the Oakland Athletics 4-1 on Saturday night.	"I don't feel like I had that kind of energy," Santana said. "I've had better stuff. I tried to keep the score close; put zeros on the board. With us losing last night, I was just trying to keep the score close because we needed this game."	Vladimir Guerrero and Juan Rivera also drove in runs for the Angels, who had lost three of their previous four games.	Santana (11-3) improved to 9-1 against the A's, including wins in his last five decisions against them. He's 35-32 against the rest of baseball.	"He had terrific stuff and he's brought that stuff into most games he's out there pitching," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "He's been doing it every start. The command was big and he made some great pitches."	Carlos Gonzalez doubled twice and drove in a run and Emil Brown had two hits and scored a run for the A's.	Jack Cust struck out in his 19th consecutive game, setting an Oakland record for non-pitchers. He's fanned 114 times to date, one short of the AL mark for most strikeouts before the All-Star break. Philadelphia's Ryan Howard leads the majors with 128 strikeouts.	Dana Eveland (7-6) gave up two runs in the first inning and then pitched his way out of trouble the rest of the way as his career-high three-game winning streak was halted. He gave up five hits over 5 1/3 innings, walking five and striking out five.	"I've had a few rough first innings lately," Eveland said. "I don't know what it is, whether it's in my preparation or not being locked in. After that I was doing a good job."	Santana saves his best for the A's. His four wins in Oakland are his most in any park outside of Anaheim, and his nine wins are his most against any team. He lowered his ERA against the A's to 1.36 (14 runs in 92 1/3 innings) and has never lost in his seven starts in Oakland.	"Every year they have a different team, different players," Santana said. "I just go out there and do my best. I don't think about it. I just try to pitch."	Scot Shields got the first two outs of the eighth before allowing Brown's single and Gonzalez's RBI double.	Francisco Rodriguez pitched the ninth for his major league-leading 37th save in 40 chances.	Santana was in a jam once, giving up singles to Mark Ellis and Daric Barton to open the seventh. Jack Hannahan's infield groundout advanced both runners but Santana struck out Donnie Murphy and Kurt Suzuki. He walked two and struck out 10, his most against the A's.	"I haven't seen him pitch enough against other teams," A's manager Bob Geren said. "I just know he's tough on us. He has one of the better fastballs in the league. Even after 100 pitches he's still throwing 97 mils an hour."	The Angels put together a two-out rally in the first inning to score their first two runs. With one out, Manny Aybar walked. After Guerrero struck out, Torii Hunter singled with Aybar taking third. Eveland's wild pitch allowed Aybar to score and Kendrick singled home Hunter.	Game notes	 Scoiscia announced that RHP Dustin Moseley will be recalled from Salt Lake City to start Sunday's game in place of LHP Joe Saunders, who left the team to be with his wife (Shanel) for the birth of their first child. ... The Angels won their club record 56th game before the All-Star Break. ... Kendrick is batting .429 (21-49) with runners in scoring position. ... A's C Kurt Suzuki is a career .059 hitter (1-17) against Santana. ... A's RHP Brad Ziegler pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings to extend his career-opening scoreless streak to 20 1/3 innings, the longest in the majors since Toronto's Victor Cruz in 1978.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- For the second time in three games, the Florida Marlins took the lead in the 11th inning and Kevin Gregg got the save. The big right-hander is halfway to 40 saves after recording 32 last year in his first season as a full-time closer.	"I enjoy pitching late in ballgames," Gregg said Saturday night after the Marlins used Dan Uggla's RBI double and Cody Ross' sacrifice fly in the 11th to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-3. "I never thought of closing because I spent most of my career as a starter in the minor leagues and didn't really get a shot as a reliever until I came up to the big leagues. But the more and time I spent as a reliever, the more I loved it."	Gregg, 6-4 with a 2.60 ERA in 46 appearances, credits a good portion of his success to the lessons he learned from Tampa Bay Rays closer Troy Percival when they were teammates with the Angels.	"I can't say enough about Troy and what he did for that whole bullpen in Anaheim," Gregg said. "A lot of it was just leading by example and giving us tidbits about pitching while we were there. His thing is that he never gives in. He attacks, attacks, attacks -- any count, any batter. You just gained knowledge from it. I still picked his brain when we saw him in Tampa."	Jorge Cantu homered for the Marlins, who lost shortstop Hanley Ramirez in the second inning after he grounded out. Ramirez, scheduled to start in Tuesday's All-Star game, said he hurt himself making a throw to first on Nomar Garciaparra's leadoff single in the first. Ramirez told reporters he would play Sunday.	Takashi Saito, the Dodgers' All-Star closer, left with tightness in his right elbow after retiring his first two batters in the ninth and going to a 2-2 count on Wes Helms.	"It was a strong tightness that I felt on the first pitch to the third batter," Saito said through a translator. "I threw a few more pitches and it got worse and worse, so it was a good idea to quit. This is the first time I've had this stiffness."	Saito is 3-3 with 17 saves, a 2.18 ERA and 53 strikeouts in 41 1/3 innings over his 39 appearances. He is scheduled to have an MRI exam on Monday.	"It's very disappointing because I've been pitching pretty well," he said. "Whatever the result is, I'd like to find out as soon as possible."	Josh Willingham led off the 11th with a double against Ramon Troncoso (0-1), and scored when Uggla pulled a 1-0 pitch inside third base for his first RBI in three games after missing the previous 11 with a left ankle strain. Uggla came home on Ross' flyball after Robert Andino sacrificed him to third.	Doug Waechter (1-2) pitched a perfect 10th inning for the victory.	Ross led off the Florida seventh with a double that extended his career-best hitting streak to 15 games, the longest by a Marlins player since a 17-game run by Alex Gonzalez in June 2005. Alfredo Amezaga, who replaced Ramirez, drove in Ross with a bloop single to center field that chased starter Hiroki Kuroda and put the Marlins ahead 3-2.	Marlins starter Ricky Nolasco allowed two runs and five hits in six innings and struck out six. The right-hander, who has won nine of his previous 10 decisions, was lifted for a pinch-hitter in the seventh when Florida took the lead. But Andre Ethier greeted left-hander Renyel Pinto with a leadoff homer to center field in the eighth.	The Marlins, who have the only rotation in the majors with five starters all under the age of 26, have taken the first three games of this four-game set. In the opener, Josh Johnson made his first start in more than a year after Tommy John surgery, and Chris Volstad came within one out of a shutout in his first big league start on Friday night.	"It's something special," Nolasco said. "We're young but we're talented and we're able to do the job. If we can just keep it up, that's all that's going to be important. Hopefully we'll be able to have something here for a long time."	Kuroda gave up three runs and seven hits over 6 2/3 innings in his third start since coming off the disabled list. In his previous outing, the right-hander pitched a one-hit, 3-0 victory against Atlanta at Dodger Stadium.	Matt Kemp, who batted leadoff the previous 11 games in place of injured outfielder Juan Pierre, was bumped to the seventh spot in the order. Garciaparra was 1-for-5 in the one hole, becoming the fifth player manager Joe Torre has used in the leadoff slot this season.	It was the first time Garciaparra hit leadoff since July 16, 2002 with the Boston Red Sox, when he went 1-for-6 and came up empty with the bases loaded in back-to-back innings at Detroit. The six-time All-Star set a major league record in 1997 with 98 RBIs in the leadoff role, a major league record that stood until Darin Erstad knocked in 100 runs for the Angels in 2000.	Kemp hit a leadoff homer in the second inning. His drive to right-center on a 1-0 pitch gave Los Angeles a 2-1 lead. But Cantu tied it in the sixth with a first-pitch drive into the lower seats in the left field corner. Cantu's 18th homer and second in two games extended the Marlins' club-record home run streak to 14 games. They lead the majors with 135.	Game notes	Andruw Jones struck out his last four times up. ... The Dodgers have allowed first-inning runs in each of the first three games in this series, after holding the Atlanta Braves hitless over the first four innings in every game of their three-game set.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Jeff Francoeur has felt comfortable ever since his brief trip to the minors.	Francoeur came through with a tiebreaking broken bat single with the bases loaded in the sixth inning to help the Atlanta Braves beat the San Diego Padres 4-1 Saturday night and extend Greg Maddux's winless skid to 12 starts.	Francoeur, who was sent down to Double-A Mississippi on July 4th and recalled July 7, singled just out of the reach of diving shortstop Khalil Greene, and Jones and Teixeira scored.	"I've felt very relaxed these last four games I've been up here," said Francoeur. "I've had a lot of fun. It's a lot more fun when you do stuff like that. If I have a few more games like that, things will start to turn around."	Francoeur was hitting .198 with runners in scoring position before being sent down and was 2-for-20 with the bases loaded before his clutch hit.	"It felt good," Francoeur said. "I know how bad I've struggled with the bases loaded this year. To be able to come up and get a nice knock and then come back and do that ... The way our pitching pitched tonight, I knew it was pretty much game over after that.	Maddux (3-8), who won his 350th game on May 10, is one start short of his longest winless drought, which was a 13-start stretch from May 11-July 14, 1990, with the Chicago Cubs. He is 0-5 with seven no decisions during his current winless streak with an ERA of 4.11.	Maddux, who became the oldest pitcher to ever steal a base in the third inning, allowed just three hits over the first five innings and retired the first two batters in the sixth. But Chipper Jones lined his second single of the night to left and Mark Teixeira singled to center before Brian McCann drew his second of three walks from Maddux loading he bases.	"It was a good pitch," said Maddux of his pitch to Francoeur on an 0-and-1 count. "Chipper hit a good pitch, Tex hit a good pitch. I pitched around McCann and Francoeur got it"	Maddux pitched seven innings allowing six hits, three earned runs. He walked two, struck out three and hit a batter,	Rookie Charlie Morton (2-2), picked up the victory for the Braves pitching 5 1/3 innings and allowing four hits and a run.	Will Ohman finished the sixth and Blaine Boyer pitched two hitless innings before Mike Gonzalez picked up his third save in three opportunities this season and his 33rd straight save over parts of five seasons.	"Maddux was the same old Maddux," said Braves manager Bobby Cox. "He can carve you up as good as anybody in baseball. This West coast swing, with Arizona, Los Angeles, San Diego -- and we haven't even seen the Giants yet -- you face a real outstanding pitcher every night. There's not an easy mark on any team on the entire West coast."	While Maddux didn't get the victory, he did make history as he stole his first base of the season in the third. In doing so he became the oldest pitcher in big league history to steal a base at 42 years and 89 days. Jim Kaat had the previous mark. It was Maddux's 11th stolen base of his career.	"They weren't holding me on," said Maddux. "I was trying to make something happen. We haven't been scoring runs. If I get thrown out there anyway what's the big deal, we have our leadoff guy up next inning."	The Braves took a 1-0 lead in the third. Brent Lillibridge doubled down the right-field line. He moved to third on a sacrifice by Morton and scored on Gregor Blanco's sacrifice fly to center.	The Padres tied the game in the bottom of the fourth. Adrian Gonzalez walked leading off the inning and came around to score on a double by Jody Gerut to the gap in left-center.	Lillibridge, a 24-year-old rookie, hit his first major league home run in the top of the ninth off reliever Joe Thatcher.	Game notes	The Padres honored members of the 1998 National League championship team prior to the game. Among the players returning for the ceremonies included former Padres Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn, Kevin Brown, Greg Vaughn, Carlos Hernandez, Sterling Hitchcock, Steve Finley, Dave Stewart, and Merv Rettenmund and current uniformed Padres closer Trevor Hoffman and batting coach Wally Joyner. The Padres beat the Braves, 4 games to 2 in the NLCS before losing to the Yankees in the 1998 World Series.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CLEVELAND (AP) -- The All-Star break couldn't come at a better time for the Tampa Bay Rays.	The Rays hope to rest, regroup, then resume baseball's feel-good story after finishing the first half on a sour note.	Jhonny Peralta drove in three runs and the Cleveland Indians beat Scott Kazmir and Tampa Bay 5-2 Sunday, handing the Rays their season-	worst seventh straight loss and dropping them out of first in the AL East.	"I hate what just happened this week, but we're sitting in a very good spot," Tampa Bay manager Joe Maddon said.	The Rays' skid is their longest since an eight-game losing streak last July. They had won seven in a row to open a five-game lead last Monday.	"We totally massacred our seven-game winning streak," said Maddon, adding that he'll meet with the club Thursday before opening the second half with a six-game homestand.	The Indians entered the series having lost 10 straight, their worst streak since 1979, but outscored the Rays 31-8 to extend their home winning streak over Tampa Bay to 13. The Rays have not won in Cleveland since Sept. 29, 2005, and dropped 18 of the last 20 meetings overall.	The Rays, who fell a half-game behind Boston for the division lead, went hitless after the third inning against Indians starter Jeremy Sowers and four relievers.	"We played poorly here," Maddon said. "We're not swinging the bats. We pitched less. Defensively, everything was just out of our reach. They outplayed us."	Peralta's two-run homer off Kazmir (7-5) in the fifth gave Cleveland a 4-2 lead. Tom Mastny (1-2) pitched two perfect innings to earn the win and Masa Kobayashi, the Indians' fifth pitcher, worked the ninth for his fifth save.	After Sowers issued a pair of one-out walks in the fourth, he struck out B.J. Upton and Carlos Pena to start a string of the final 17 Tampa Bay batters going down in order.	Tampa Bay took a 1-0 lead in the second despite not putting a ball in play. Sowers walked four, committed a balk, and struck out the side during a strange 41-pitch inning that included Indians manager Eric Wedge's ejection by plate umpire Kerwin Danley.	After fanning All-Star Evan Longoria, Sowers walked Jonny Gomes. With an 0-2 count on Shawn Riggans, Gomes broke for second as Sowers threw to first and Danley ruled the left-hander balked. Wedge yelled from the dugout in protest.	After Gomes stole third and Riggans also walked, Wedge questioned Danley's strike zone, too, and was tossed for the third time this season.	Sowers fanned Ben Zobrist, then walked both Gabe Gross and Akinori Iwamura to force in a run.	"The umpire had a pretty tough strike zone, but I have to do a better job earlier in the game of earning the zone," Sowers said. "It was a pretty bizarre inning."	Riggans' RBI single in the third made it 2-0 but Cleveland tied it in the bottom half. Franklin Gutierrez singled off Longoria's glove at third, took third on Jamey Carroll's one-out single, and scored on Ben Francisco's base hit to right. Peralta drove in Carroll with a sacrifice fly.	All-Star Grady Sizemore opened the Indians' fifth with a walk and scored on Peralta's two-out homer, the shortstop's 16th of the season and fourth in seven games.	Andy Marte made it 5-2 with a leadoff homer in the sixth.	"We played some pretty good baseball the last four days against a very good team," Wedge said.	Sowers had the oddest outing of his young career. The left-hander gave up three hits and two runs over four innings, setting career highs of seven walks and eight strikeouts. In his first 196 innings in the majors, the first-round pick in the 2004 draft had only 53 walks and 77 strikeouts.	Kazmir, one of Tampa Bay's three All-Stars, gave up five runs and eight hits over six innings, dropping to 1-4 in his last seven starts since June 11 following a six-game winning streak.	"It's been a great first half," Kazmir said. "There are going to be times like this in a season. We're going to go through a bump or a slow stage, but we have to be able to bounce back. We have to not dwell on this."	Game notes	 Tampa Bay is 36-14 and 19-25 on the road. ... According to Elias Sports Bureau, the Indians' home winning streak over Tampa Bay is the longest current one of its kind in the majors. The Indians defeated the Detroit Tigers 15 straight in Cleveland from 1994 to 1997. ... Marte's homer was his first in the majors since April 4, 2007. ... Sizemore has 23 homers and is the first Indians player to lead the AL in that category at the All-Star break since Jim Thome (26) in 2001. ... Rays OF Carl Crawford, in the worst hitless streak of his career (0-for-25) didn't play. ... Rays DH Willy Aybar went 0-for-3 and is in a 1-for-16 skid.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DETROIT (AP) -- Justin Verlander knew it was a big game, and he wasn't about to let his teammates down.	Verlander tossed seven sharp innings and the Detroit Tigers beat the Minnesota Twins 4-2 Sunday, denying their AL Central rivals a four-game sweep in the final series before the All-Star break.	"My intention was to go out there and get us a win going into the break, and I was able to do that," said Verlander, who improved to 5-0 in his last seven starts. "That was big."	Manager Jim Leyland had avoided calling the game a must-win for the Tigers, and stuck with that line of thought after the victory.	"We needed it bad, but it wouldn't have been the end of the world if we had lost, and it doesn't mean that we are going to win the pennant because we won," he said. "Justin pitched really well. They've been hot all week, and it seemed like every ball they've hit hard has dropped in, and he stopped them."	Verlander (7-9) allowed two runs and four hits, struck out eight and walked two. He hasn't allowed more than two earned runs during his unbeaten streak, lowering his ERA from 5.05 to 4.15.	"Of all the times I've faced him, that's the best I've seen him throw," Minnesota's Jason Kubel said. "He made all the pitches he needed."	Clete Thomas hit his first major league homer for the Tigers, who had lost 10 of their last 12 games to the Twins.	Miguel Cabrera put Detroit ahead 3-2 with a run-scoring groundout in the fifth and Matt Joyce hit his ninth homer in the eighth.	Thomas' second-inning drive off Nick Blackburn (7-5) gave the Tigers a 2-0 lead and came after a disputed call allowed Marcus Thames to reach.	Thames hit a one-out grounder to third baseman Brian Buscher, and first base umpire Jim Wolf ruled Buscher's throw pulled Justin Morneau off the bag. After Morneau and manager Ron Gardenhire argued, all four umpires conferred, but the call stood even though replays showed Morneau was still touching the base when he caught the throw.	"[Wolf] told me that he had blown the call -- he checked with the other umpires and no one else had seen it," Gardenhire said. "He said that he had made a mistake. All you can do is ask the umpires to be honest -- we all make mistakes.	"He didn't throw the next pitch over the fence."	Blackburn (7-5) allowed three runs, two earned, and five hits in seven innings.	"All my pitches were working -- I had a really good fastball," Blackburn said. "I just made a couple mistakes and it cost me."	The Twins didn't have a hit until Alexi Casilla led off the fourth with a single. Joe Mauer grounded into a fielder's choice but Morneau doubled to put runners on second and third.	Mauer scored on Verlander's wild pitch and Brendan Harris singled in Morneau to tie it at 2. Harris has five RBIs in the last two games.	Joel Zumaya worked the eighth and Todd Jones got three outs for his 17th save in 19 tries.	"That's not the way we wanted it to end," Gardenhire said. "We wanted to take all four and make it a better road trip, but they just pitched better than we did."	Game notes	Magglio Ordonez (strained oblique) will play a rehab game with Class-A West Michigan during the All-Star break, and could be back with the Tigers when they resume play Thursday in Baltimore. ... Morneau will take part in Monday's All-Star Home Run Derby in New York. ... Leyland will be among 50 guests from baseball at a White House dinner on Wednesday night. "I can't believe that I'm on the list, but it is going to be exciting to have dinner with President Bush," he said. "That's big time."	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

TORONTO (AP) -- Andy Pettitte isn't happy with the way the New York Yankees are playing heading into the All-Star break.	A.J. Burnett came within two outs of a shutout, Marco Scutaro hit a three-run home run and the Toronto Blue Jays beat the Yankees 4-1 on Sunday.	"If we want to make the playoffs, we've got to be better," Pettitte said. "We stink right now, for the most part. As a team, we've kind of stunk it up here lately and we've got to play better."	The Yankees ended the first half of the year by losing three of four against the Pirates and Blue Jays. Still, New York's 50-45 record is an improvement on a year ago, when they went to the All-Star Game at .500.	Pettitte's teammates agreed there was room for improvement, but didn't feel so bad about the Yankees' fortunes.	"Today was a tough day," catcher Jorge Posada said. "We got outpitched, but I think we're going in the right direction."	Shortstop Derek Jeter said the key is consistency.	"We've been a little bit inconsistent," Jeter said. "We just need to find a little bit more consistency here."	A rash of injuries has forced 17 Yankees onto the disabled list already this season. With that in mind, first-year manager Joe Girardi knows his situation could be worse.	"We could be buried, but we're not," Girardi said. "I think we're in a decent position to make a run. We need to get everyone back and healthy and just put streaks together."	Pitching on three days' rest for the third time in his career, Burnett (10-8) allowed one run and six hits, walked one and struck out eight. The right-hander is 3-0 with a 3.00 ERA when pitching on three days' rest.	"He wanted the ball and he was determined," Blue Jays manager Cito Gaston said. "You could see it in his eyes from the first pitch that he was going to have a good day."	Jason Giambi spoiled Burnett's shutout bid with a solo home run in the ninth, his 19th. Posada followed with a single before B.J. Ryan replaced Burnett and got Robinson Cano to ground into a double play to record his 18th save in 20 opportunities.	Toronto won for the fifth time in six games to improve to 47-48 at the break.	Burnett, who has won four of his past five, improved to 5-2 in eight career starts against New York.	"I was free and easy," Burnett said. "I got ahead quite a bit. Once I was able to find the hook, it helped out tremendously."	The Yankees did little else to threaten Burnett. Bobby Abreu doubled to begin the fourth and, two outs later, Posada was hit by a pitch, but Cano grounded out to first.	Abreu and Alex Rodriguez had back-to-back one-out singles in the sixth, but Giambi flied out and Posada struck out.	"He never got out of his rhythm," Girardi said of Burnett. "He located the ball all day. He elevated the ball when he had to, he was able to get an inch or two off the plate when he had to. He was outstanding today."	Pettitte came in having won seven of his past eight decisions, but took the loss in this one after allowing four runs and eight hits in six innings. Pettitte (10-7) walked one and struck out six.	All the scoring came in the second, when Kevin Mench led off with a double and scored on a single by Scott Rolen. After Adam Lind walked, Scutaro tried twice to bunt but failed, then drilled a 1-2 pitch over the wall in left for his third homer of the season.	"It doesn't happen often, but it happens once in a while," Gaston said. "Thank goodness it happened today for us."	Pettitte was surprised Scutaro was able to hit a sinking cut-fastball out of the park.	"The pitch wasn't even going to be a strike," Pettitte said. "Scutaro went down and got it and lifted it. I don't know if he was looking for it or whatever."	Last April 15, Scutaro beat the Yankees with a walk-off, three-run homer against Mariano Rivera.	Rolen doubled to begin the fourth and went to third on Lind's single, but was thrown out at the plate by Abreu when he tried to score on Scutaro's fly to right.	Toronto finished with four doubles in all, and five of the Blue Jays' nine hits were for extra bases.	Jeter batted in the leadoff spot for the second straight game and finished 0-for-4 with two strikeouts, snapping a 10-game hitting streak. Girardi said Jeter will continue to lead off until Johnny Damon (left shoulder) returns from the disabled list. Damon is eligible to come off the DL next Sunday.	Posada caught for the second time in three games but surrendered two stolen bases. Posada, who missed 32 games with a right shoulder injury earlier this season, has thrown out just three of 35 runners but feels his arm is improving.	Game notes	 The Yankees began wearing black armbands on their left sleeve Sunday in honor of former player Bobby Murcer, who died Saturday. They will continue to wear them for the rest of the season. ... The three-game series drew 131,295 fans to Rogers Centre. ... RHP Mike Mussina will start against Oakland on Friday, the Yankees' first game following the All-Star break. He will be followed in the rotation by RHP Joba Chamberlain, Pettitte, RHP Sidney Ponson and RHP Darrell Rasner. ... Girardi said OF Hideki Matsui (left knee) could rejoin the team during the Oakland series that follows the All-Star break. ... Yankees RHP Phil Hughes (broken rib) was fine one day after throwing 25 pitches in his first bullpen session Saturday at New York's minor league facility in Tampa, Fla. He is scheduled for another bullpen session Tuesday.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

BOSTON (AP) -- David Ortiz is getting ready to return to a first-place team.	Daisuke Matsuzaka pitched six scoreless innings and the Boston Red Sox reclaimed the AL East lead going into the All-Star break, defeating the Baltimore Orioles 2-1 Sunday.	The Red Sox moved a half-game ahead of Tampa Bay and took the division lead for the first time since June 28. Boston trailed by a season-high five games last weekend, then won five of six while the Rays lost seven in a row.	"I was talking trash to my teammates to make sure they got back in first place before I came back," Ortiz said. "I can't wait to start playing again and I am feeling good."	Ortiz has missed 39 games because of an injured wrist. The All-Star slugger is expected to return in time for a series against the rival New York Yankees on July 25.	Ortiz will be among seven Red Sox players joining manager Terry Francona and his coaching staff at the All-Star Game at Yankee Stadium.	The Red Sox went into the break with the best home record in the majors at 36-11.	"We came into the homestand down five games but this shows anything can happen and hopefully we can keep rolling," reliever Manny Delcarmen said.	Matsuzaka (10-1) struggled with his control, but worked around four hits and five walks. Jonathan Papelbon escaped in the ninth for his 28th save of the season and 100th of his career.	"I would've liked to have done it without giving up a run," Papelbon said. "One hundred down and hopefully 3(00), 400 more to go."	Baltimore lost for the sixth time in seven games, and dropped its 14th straight Sunday game. The major league record for consecutive losses on a specific day is 21 -- the 1939 St. Louis Browns and 1890 Pittsburgh Innocents both did it on Tuesdays.	Matsuzaka helped himself by snaring Melvin Mora's hard comebacker with the bases loaded to end the fifth, and has given up just one run in his last 23 1/3 innings. Only twice in 16 starts has he allowed more than three runs.	Even with his impressive record and a 2.65 ERA, Matsuzaka is not among the Red Sox representatives in the All-Star Game.	"When he locates, he's as good as there is," Francona said. "He created some jams for himself, but fortunately they did not string together a couple of hits."	Daniel Cabrera (6-5) fell to 2-10 lifetime against Boston. He somehow managed to only allow one earned run despite permitting 13 runners in 4 1/3 innings.	"He competed today and did not give in," Orioles manager Dave Trembley said. "This is a tough one to lose. We needed one hit, one pitch a little different, but we played our hearts out."	After Red Sox relievers Hideki Okajima and Delcarmen combined for two scoreless innings, Papelbon took over in the ninth with a 2-0 lead. Brian Roberts and Adam Jones singled with one out and Aubrey Huff hit an RBI single with two outs before Mora lined out to end it.	J.D. Drew gave the Red Sox a 1-0 lead when he doubled home Dustin Pedroia in the first inning. Pedroia hit .440 over the last 20 games and finished with 124 hits at the break, one shy of the franchise record shared by Wade Boggs and Nomar Garciaparra.	Pedroia drove in the game-winning run in the fourth with a groundout.	Game notes	 Boston's biggest AL East lead this year was 3 1/2 games. ... ... The Orioles stranded 13 baserunners. ... Opponents are 0-for-11 this season with the bases loaded against Matsuzaka. ... Orioles starting pitching has a 7.23 over the last 10 games. ... Sean Casey reached base in all four plate appearances with two hits and two walks. ... 1B Kevin Youkilis left the game with a triceps contusion in the fifth inning after being hit by a pitch from Cabrera. X-rays were negative.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Brandon Backe loves to bat, slide and play the field. All things being equal, he'd rather be an everyday player than a pitcher.	On Sunday, he was about as close to Mr. Everything as he's ever going to get. He pitched seven-plus innings, went 2-for-3 with a double and scored twice in the Houston Astros' 5-0 victory over the notoriously shutout-prone Washington Nationals.	"I would just love be able to be the everyday player -- diving catches, running into the wall, getting dirty," Backe said. "I'm just sad I didn't get to slide today."	Backe raised his batting average to .345 while lowering his ERA to 4.76. He was so effective at the plate that other players were laying down sacrifice bunts to move their pitcher along. About the only thing he didn't do was execute a squeeze play in the fourth inning, instead fouling the pitch off.	"We feel like we're playing with nine instead of eight," outfielder Carlos Lee said. "Backe's a good hitter."	Ty Wigginton added his eighth homer of the season and Lee had three RBIs for the Astros, who took two of three from the Nationals and finished 4-5 on their road trip leading into the All-Star break.	But back to Backe (6-9), who apparently hasn't heard that pitchers aren't supposed to spend a ton of time on the basepaths on a hot summer day. He supplemented his first multihit game of the year with his best game to date on the mound, allowing only five hits with four walks and five strikeouts. He worked out of jams in the second and third but settled down in the middle innings before he was removed after issuing a walk to lead off the eighth.	"Brandon Backe, Brandon Backe, Brandon Backe, Brandon Backe, that was what we got today," manager Cecil Cooper said. "Two-for-3. Scored a couple of runs. Seven shutout innings. What could you say? He threw over 100 pitches. I thought he was really, really good. That's the Brandon Backe we like."	Backe feasted on the injury-plagued Nationals, who have baseball's worst record and worst offense. They were shut out for the 12th time, most in the majors, and have lost 10 of 13. They sent the minimum number of batters to the plate over the final five innings, their only two runners erased by double plays.	"We need a few more guys to step it up," manager Manny Acta said. "Right now, we're battling on almost every at-bat."	Washington starter Odalis Perez (2-7), whose last outing ended prematurely when he was ejected after arguing a pair of third-inning balks, allowed three runs and nine hits over six innings. Perez enters the break with a respectable 3.71 ERA, but, like many Nationals pitchers, he has suffered from a seasonlong lack of run support.	Backe doubled to left open the third inning and scored on Lance Berkman's two-out single. Berkman then stole second without a throw when the Nationals stopped paying attention to him, a miscue that became costly when Lee singled to center to score Berkman.	Backe's single to left led off the seventh. He was bunted to second, then he and Berkman scored on Lee's two-out single.	"Everybody on the team knows I take pride in hitting," Backe said. "You can't throw the ball all the time and make yourself a better pitcher, but you can always hit. I can't imagine anybody working on it more than me, to be honest with you."	Game notes	 Houston first-round draft pick Jason Castro, who agreed to contract terms Saturday, had breakfast with Cooper and visited with the team before the game. ... Perez fell to 0-5 vs. the Astros in seven career starts. The six previous starts had been at Houston.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PHILADELPHIA (ESPN.com news services) -- Now in his ninth season, Pat Burrell would like to someday play in an All-Star Game.	In the meantime, he plans to keep getting big hits for the Philadelphia Phillies.	Burrell hit a tiebreaking, three-run homer in the eighth inning and the Phillies held their NL East lead heading into the All-Star break, beating the Arizona Diamondbacks 6-3 Sunday.	The Phillies began the day with a half-game edge over both Florida and the New York Mets. Arizona still leads the NL West, albeit with a 47-48 record.	Burrell finished third in fan voting to become the 32nd and final player added to the NL All-Star team. He was then bypassed in favor of New York's David Wright to replace injured Chicago outfielder Alfonso Soriano.	"You know what? It's one of those things," said Burrell, hitting .275 with 23 homers and 57 RBIs. "I'd like to go. But no message. It's over."	Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said he thinks Burrell is deserving of an All-Star spot.	"I think Pat has been tremendous," Manuel said. "At the same time, I think Pat can hit .300. How about that? If he did that, his numbers would be off the chart."	After starters Brandon Webb and Cole Hamels left after the seventh with the score tied at 2, the Phillies broke away.	Chase Utley and Ryan Howard singled and Burrell followed with his home run, connecting against Chad Qualls (2-7). Pedro Feliz hit a solo homer one out later.	"I thought I threw some pretty good pitches," Qualls said. "The pitch to Howard was down and the one to Burrell was down and away. It's frustrating, but that's the way it goes in this game sometimes."	Ryan Madson (2-0) pitched a scoreless eighth to get the win. Brad Lidge allowed an RBI single to Orlando Hudson in the ninth.	Chad Tracy homered and Chris Burke had three hits for the Diamondbacks.	Webb, who leads the major leagues with 13 wins, gave up seven hits. He struck out six and walked none.	"Every time he goes out there, he gives us a consistent effort," Arizona manager Bob Melvin said. "He's one of the most consistent in walks. That's why he's going to the All-Star Game."	An All-Star for the third straight season, Webb let Philadelphia make it 2-all in the seventh on an RBI double by Jimmy Rollins.	Webb, who threw 108 pitches, said he likely would sit out Tuesday's All-Star Game.	"Probably not a real good chance I'll be throwing, I would say," he said, according to The Arizona Republic. "I'd be maybe an emergency guy."	Hamels helped himself in the fifth, hitting a double that scored Feliz from first to get the Phillies within 2-1.	Hamels gave up a season-high 11 hits, struck out eight and walked one. He has pitched at least seven innings in eight straight games.	"I think I have a lot to improve on in the second half," Hamels said. "That's what the second half is all about. I'm going to relax, play a little golf and come back fresh."	Tracy hit his fifth home run in the second inning.	The Diamondbacks made it 2-0 in the fourth by stringing together three hits with two outs. Chris Young bunted for a single, Burke followed with an infield single and Robby Hammock, batting only .158 at the time, hit an RBI single.	Game notes	 The Phillies recalled RHP Joe Bisenius from Triple-A Lehigh Valley and optioned R.J. Swindle. ... Rollins stole two bases in the game, giving him 38 straight, the longest streak in the major leagues dating to Aug. 31, 2007. He's 24-for-24 this season. ... The Diamondbacks finished 3-3 on their six-game road trip. ... Phillies C Chris Coste snapped an 0-for-24 drought with a single in the seventh. ... Philadelphia OF Geoff Jenkins left the game with a bruised left elbow.	Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.

PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The St. Louis Cardinals rediscovered their offense, and a worked-over Pittsburgh Pirates pitching staff will have trouble forgetting this weekend.	Aaron Miles drove in five runs with a home run and a triple and the Cardinals held off a Pittsburgh comeback this time, beating the Pirates 11-6 Sunday.	Miles got three hits and is batting .335 (64-for-191) in 46 games as a starter. His three-run homer off Ian Snell in the fourth inning -- only his second of the season -- came on an inside pitch that was nearly shoulder-high and put St. Louis up 4-1.	After Pittsburgh rallied for the second day in a row and took a 6-5 lead on Chris Gomez's two-run double in the sixth, Miles finished St. Louis' four-run, go-ahead seventh with a two-run triple.	Ryan Ludwick added his 21st homer, a solo shot in the eighth that was his third in as many games. Troy Glaus completed a 10-for-13 weekend with a home run, one of the Cardinals' 15 hits.	"It's called hot," manager Tony La Russa said. "We knew he could get hot, but that was scalding."	Franquelis Osoria (3-3), brought in to protect the Pirates' one-run lead in the seventh, allowed five of the six batters he faced to reach base. Osoria hit Albert Pujols with a pitch after Ludwick singled. Glaus doubled in a run and Chris Duncan had an RBI single that put St. Louis up 7-6.	"It was a good weekend for us, we put a lot of hits together and scored a lot of runs," Glaus said. "From the offense's perspective, it was a pretty good series."	From the Pirates' pitching perspective, it was terrible.	The Cardinals scored 28 runs and had 50 hits while winning two of three in the series -- after being held to two runs or fewer in six of their previous seven. They could have swept their final series before the All-Star break, but couldn't hold leads of 9-3 and 10-4 while losing 12-11 in 10 innings Saturday night despite getting a season-high 22 hits.	The Cardinals bullpen didn't let that happen again, even after starter Joel Pineiro -- previously 4-0 against the Pirates -- gave up 10 hits and six runs in 5 2/3 innings.	Jason Bay had a tying two-run single in the fifth, giving him seven RBIs in two games, but Russ Springer (2-0), Kyle McClellan and Ryan Franklin combined for 3 1/3 scoreless innings. Springer retired the only batter he faced for the victory, and McClellan pitched two shutout innings.	The night before, Cardinals relievers gave up eight runs over the final four innings.	"It was important we put that game last night behind us," La Russa said. "We came out and showed everybody, look, you beat us last night and we're going to try to beat you today."	St. Louis is 53-43 at the break, the NL's second-best record. The Cardinals trail Chicago by 4 1/2 games in the NL Central.	"It's good to go into the break with a lot of guys swinging the bat well and feeling good," Miles said.	The Pirates, six games under at the break, unexpectedly have one of the NL's best offenses, but the pitching staff has been much worse than expected with a 5.13 ERA -- more than a run per game higher than St. Louis' 4.08. Pittsburgh's bullpen gave up 12 runs in the series.	"We've kind of been limping for about 10 days now," manager John Russell said. "The bullpen has been overused. Guys are giving what they have but they don't have a lot left in the tank -- and they've been used a lot."	Snell had another rough outing against the Cardinals, giving up five hits and four runs in five innings in his second start since coming off the disabled list with a sore elbow. He has a 9.00 ERA in four starts against them this season.	"They came out really aggressive from the start," said Snell, who has won only once since April 12. "That one pitch [to Miles] really got me. I didn't realize he had that much power."	Game notes	 Glaus, Duncan and Miles all had three hits. ... According to the Elias Sports Bureau, the Cardinals hadn't had as many hits as they did Saturday and lost since they had 23 in a 19-15, 10-inning defeat to the Reds on July 1, 1956. ... Cardinals rookie LHP Jaime Garcia, who made his major league debut as a reliever Friday, is scheduled to start Sunday vs. San Diego. ... Miles' five RBIs were the most by a Cardinals player this season. His career high is six RBIs, in 2004 against Arizona. ... After the game, the Pirates optioned RHP Romulo Sanchez to Triple-A Indianapolis.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

MILWAUKEE (AP) -- CC Sabathia's first week with the Milwaukee Brewers can be summed up with one key stat: Two starts, two wins.	Sabathia homered in his first National League complete game to help Milwaukee avoid a sweep with a 3-2 victory over the Cincinnati Reds on Sunday.	Sabathia went deep off Reds starter Homer Bailey in the third, his third career home run and second this season. Sabathia became the first pitcher to hit home runs in both leagues in one season since Earl Wilson did it in 1970 for Detroit and San Diego, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.	After allowing run-scoring sacrifice flies to David Ross in the second and Adam Dunn in the third, Sabathia (2-0) shut down Cincinnati, striking out nine batters, all from the fourth inning on. He struck out the side in the ninth.	"I kept us in the game, got out of some jams and pounded the strike zone after that," Sabathia said. "I just try to go out and help the team win."	Manager Ned Yost left Sabathia in for the ninth despite his high pitch count.	"He was at 111 pitches, but the lineup set up for him with all left-handers, except for [David] Ross," Yost said. "We sent him back out there just for that instance. With those left-handers, we felt good with CC on the mound."	Sabathia ended up throwing 122 pitches, 82 for strikes.	Dunn said that even though the Reds had faced Sabathia in the past, it didn't make batting against him any easier.	"He's probably one of the most consistent pitchers you'll ever face," Dunn said. "Everytime you face him, you know what you're going to get."	Sabathia improved to 4-0 in nine starts against Cincinnati. He beat them 6-0 on June 27 at Progressive Field.	The Brewers (52-43) head into the All-Star break in third place NL Central, five games behind Chicago and a half-game behind St. Louis.	The game was tied at 2 in the ninth when pinch-hitter Craig Counsell hit a game-winning sacrifice fly to help the Brewers avoid being a three-game sweep to end the first half of the season.	Bill Hall led off the bottom of the ninth with a single off David Weathers (2-5). Mike Cameron dropped down a bunt in front of the plate that Weathers grabbed and threw wildly to first. Hall alertly took off for third and beat the throw. Jason Kendall was walked intentionally.	Francisco Cordero replaced Weathers to face Counsell who hit a fly ball to right fielder Jay Bruce on the first pitch. Hall tagged up on the play and beat the throw home.	"CC brought the excitement, struck out the side in the ninth inning," Hall said. "We wanted to go out and give him a win in the ninth inning. So we had the excitement, we had the momentum. It's a great way to end the first half and, hopefully, it continues on Friday."	In his second start since being traded from Cleveland to Milwaukee, Sabathia pitched an eight-hitter, his fourth complete game of the season and 20th of his career. On Tuesday, he pitched six solid innings to beat the Rockies 7-3.	The Reds (46-50) lost leadoff hitter Jerry Hairston, who had to be carried off the field after straining his right hamstring running out a bunt single.	He led off the third inning by bunting toward third. About a quarter of the way there, he pulled up and limped across the bag. He made it to first safely, then fell over clutching his upper right leg.	Manager Dusty Baker, Joey Votto and trainer Mark Mann carried him off. Hairston will have an MRI in Cincinnati on Monday.	"I tweaked it a little bit," said Hairston who was also hit in the elbow while he tried to bunt leading off the game. "I think I was more scared than anything. My hamstring just locked up on me really, really bad. Maybe I'm not drinking enough water. I'm hoping that will be it."	Bailey, recalled from Triple-A Louisville before the game, matched up well with Sabathia early. He allowed two runs and five hits over 5 2/3 innings, didn't walk a batter and struck out four.	Bailey's only mistake was a 0-2 pitch in the third that Sabathia lined over the wall in right. Sabathia also went deep June 21, with Cleveland against the Los Angeles Dodgers.	Bailey left with a runner at first and 2-1 lead in the sixth, but the bullpen let him down. Reliever Bill Bray promptly walked Prince Fielder and then allowed a run-scoring double by Gabe Kapler.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Finally, somebody else messed up even worse than Seattle.	Adrian Beltre was caught in a rundown between third base and home in the ninth inning of a tie game Sunday. But he scored the go-ahead run on John Buck's throwing error and the Mariners went into the All-Star break with a 4-3 victory over the Royals that made their AL-worst 37-58 record seem a tiny bit less painful.	"Finally, we got the better end of it," manager Jim Riggelman said. "A couple of plays went our way. They had a little bit of a high throw and gave us a break, finally."	Said Beltre: "Any win is a good positive for us right now."	Leading off the ninth against All-Star closer Joakim Soria, Beltre hit a popup into shallow center and sped to second with a popup double when it floated just barely out of the reach of shortstop Mike Aviles.	A sacrifice put him at third and then, going on contact, he broke for the plate when Willie Bloomquist hit a sharp grounder back to the mound.	Soria threw the ball to Buck, and Beltre was trapped. But Buck threw over the head of third baseman Alex Gordon, and Beltre turned back toward home. Aviles, backing up Gordon, made an outstanding effort to stop the ball from rolling into the outfield, and looked like he may have had time to throw to Buck to get Beltre.	But instead he threw to second in a futile try to nail Bloomquist.	"My job was to stay in the run-down and hopefully the batter can get to second base, so he can still be in scoring position," said Beltre. "I kind of had my back to the play when [Buck] threw the ball. I looked back and the ball was over the third baseman's head."	Aviles started to throw home.	"But I would have had to throw over Gordon and Beltre to get the ball to Bucky," he said. "I thought that would have been a tougher play."	For a split-second, Beltre had that dreaded "here we go again," feeling.	"I think [Aviles] might have had a shot to throw me out," he said. "But it looked like he caught the ball sort of off balance."	The run was unearned off Soria, the Royals' lone All-Star, who fell to 1-2. Sean Green (2-2) got the win and Brandon Morrow got the final two outs for his ninth save in 11 chances.	The Mariners won for only the second time in eight games, but are 12-11 since Riggelman replaced John McLaren on June 20.	"It's nice to end on a positive note before the All-Star break," said Bloomquist.	The Royals go into the break at 43-53, an improvement on their 38-50 mark last season.	"Alex and I were both on the inside of the line," said a downcast Buck. "I just threw it too high."	A day after David DeJesus hit a game-winning homer off Morrow with two outs in the ninth, Morrow got his revenge, getting DeJesus to fly out to left to end the game.	"I think it added a little more adrenaline that I had to come back and try to get him the second day," said Morrow "We haven't got a lot of breaks this year. It's nice to go into the All-Star break on a win and have something go our way."	Royals starter Kyle Davies, looking for his first win in five starts, had a 2-1 lead with two out in the seventh but surrendered a single to Bloomquist. Rookie catcher Jeff Clement, breaking an 0-for-15 slide that had dropped his average to .159, drove a 3-2 pitch over the fence to put Seattle on top 3-2. It was Clement's fifth of the year.	Ross Gload and Buck singled leading off the bottom of the seventh and were sacrificed up a base before Aviles tied the game with an RBI ground out.	Aviles went 3-for-4 with two RBIs for Kansas City.	"It's a good time for a break," said Kansas City manager Trey Hillman. "Everybody's going to try to recharge both mentally and physically."	Game notes	 The Royals stole five bases in the three games, all off Clement. ... Aviles has a seven-game hitting streak. ... DeJesus still leads the majors with a .460 average with runners in scoring position. Green leads the AL relievers with 48 appearances. ... Clement is 0-for-10 in throwing out runners this season.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CHICAGO (AP) -- Tim Lincecum was the first pitcher to upstage Ryan Dempster at Wrigley Field this season.	Lincecum tossed eight strong innings in a matchup of All-Star pitchers, handing Dempster his first home loss and leading the San Francisco Giants to a 4-2 victory over the Chicago Cubs on Sunday.	Dempster (10-4), one of eight Cubs selected for Tuesday's game at Yankee Stadium, entered with a 10-0 record in 11 home starts this season, but was overshadowed by another brilliant start by Lincecum (11-2). The 24-year-old right-hander struck out nine, allowed one runs and six hits and also drove in a run with his first career triple.	"Quite a show he put on there today against a tough, tough ballclub that's playing well in their ballpark," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "He's one of the best young pitchers in the game and he showed it today."	Ray Durham hit a two-run single in the third and Fred Lewis tripled in a run in the seventh for San Francisco, which ended a six-game losing streak.	"It's a good note to end on, especially going into the All-Star break. Something to build on. Go home happy," Lincecum said.	Brian Wilson survived a shaky ninth inning to record his National League-leading 25th save. The closer yielded an RBI single to fellow All-Star Geovany Soto but bounced back to strike out pinch-hitter Daryle Ward and coax Ryan Theriot into a game-ending groundout with a runner on third.	The NL Central-leading Cubs finished a 4-2 homestand and head into the All-Star break with a 37-12 record at Wrigley Field, despite injuries to key players like Alfonso Soriano and Carlos Zambrano.	"We've overcome a lot here," manager Lou Piniella said. "Soriano has really missed half of the first half. He's been on the disabled list and we've had [Rich] Hill that's missed just about all of the first half, a starter we were counting on. We had our No. 1 starter [Zambrano] on the DL and we've done quite well.	"Let's hope we do just as well or better in the second half and we will just be fine."	The bottom of the Giants order hurt Dempster in the third inning. With one out, Omar Vizquel broke an 0-for-11 skid with a single to center and stole second. Lincecum followed with a hard liner to right fielder Mark DeRosa, who charged the ball but couldn't get in front of it. Lincecum's drive rolled all the way to the wall, easily scoring Vizquel.	"I just think I got lucky. If you look at the swing it doesn't look very pretty. It looks like a backhand in tennis," Lincecum said. "I was like 'Wow, it hit the soft spot of the bat and not right on my hands this time.'"	Durham added a two-out, two-run single later in the inning to give the Giants a 3-0 lead.	"I thought Dempster pitched well," DeRosa said. "I kind of put him in a tough spot there, misplaying that ball in the outfield that led to them scoring three runs."	Dempster (10-4) allowed four runs and seven hits in 6 2/3 innings. He struck out six and walked two.	"It's a tough matchup," Dempster said. "He [Lincecum] is not going to give up a lot of runs."	Before the game, Carlos Marmol became the eighth Cubs player on the NL All-Star team when the reliever was selected to replace injured teammate Kerry Wood. Chicago tied the NL record, becoming the fourth team to send eight players to the game.	Before this year, the most All-Stars for the Cubs was six in 1936 and 1988. Outfielder Soriano (broken hand), who was voted to the starting lineup, will miss the game because of a broken hand.	Game notes	 Wood has a blister on his right index finger. He pitched on Friday, closing out a 3-1 win over the Giants for his 24th save in 29 opportunities. Wood hopes to return Friday. ... Dempster is 0-7 as a starter against the Giants. ... Soriano is aiming to come back July 24th against the Marlins.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Ian Kinsler, Michael Young and Milton Bradley took care of business at home before heading to the All-Star Game.	Kinsler extended his majors-best hitting streak to 25 games with three hits and drove in three runs, and Young and Bradley also had key hits, leading the Texas Rangers to a wild 12-11 victory over the AL Central-leading Chicago White Sox that clinched another series win.	"We're showing a lot of character, clawing our way through games," said Young, who has a 15-game hitting streak. "We're playing as a team. ... The momentum we've built up over the last couple of months, hopefully we can carry that over into the second half."	Since having the worst record in the majors at 7-16 in late April, the Rangers (50-46) have won 16 of their last 23 series -- and split three others, including a four-game set last week against the AL West-leading Angels, who are 7½ games ahead of third-place Texas.	Chicago (54-40) maintained a 1½-game division lead over Minnesota despite its third loss in four games.	The White Sox had a 2-0 lead only three pitches in, and finished with a season-high 22 hits. And that still wasn't enough.	"This was the worst baseball game I've ever seen. ... The pitchers should look themselves in the mirror and be embarrassed," Chicago manager Ozzie Guillen said. "That was ugly. That's the worst I've seen in a long time."	Things didn't look so bad in the Rangers clubhouse, even though the 22 hits were the most they've ever allowed in a victory. Texas countered with 17 hits.	Marlon Byrd hit a tiebreaking RBI double in the seventh that finally put Texas ahead to stay.	Jermaine Dye went 4-for-5, with a homer in the eighth and a two-run single in the ninth, and five other White Sox players had three hits. All-Star outfielder Carlos Quentin also homered.	Chicago scored three times in the ninth against closer C.J. Wilson before Jim Thome and Paul Konerko both took called third strikes to end the game.	"It was a battle but C.J. made the last strike. Game over," said second-year manager Ron Washington, whose future was in doubt back in April.	Bradley, the AL starting designated hitter in place of injured David Ortiz, matched a career high with his 19th homer and had an RBI single. Josh Hamilton, leading the majors with 95 RBIs and voted an All-Star starter, was 0-for-4 and saw the end of his streak of eight straight games driving in a run, the last five being multi-RBI games.	Thome had two doubles and has reached base in 28 straight games against Texas -- 16-for-27 over the last nine. His RBI double in the third put Chicago ahead 5-4.	But Bradley led off the bottom of the third with a homer that ricocheted off the pole down the right-field line before RBI singles by Max Ramirez and Kinsler.	That hit for Kinsler, already his third in the game, put the Rangers up 7-5. The AL's leading hitter (.337) had doubles in each of the first two innings, increasing his majors-leading total to 34.	Some fans chanted "M-V-P!, M-V-P!" when Kinsler came to the plate later in the game.	"I'd rather talk about the team. We're playing good baseball," said Kinsler, a first-time All-Star. "It's tough to talk about MVP and that kind of stuff. The guys around me make it easy to do what I'm doing."	David Murphy led off Texas' big seventh with a single. Boone Logan (2-2) had him picked off but Murphy took off for second and reached third on first baseman Konerko's wild throw into the outfield. Byrd then lined a double into the left-field corner for an 8-7 lead.	Adam Russell hit Kinsler, an AL reserve for his first All-Star appearance, with a pitch to load the bases before Young's two-run single extended his hitting streak. Young also hit in 23 straight earlier this season, longest in the majors until Kinsler passed him.	Ramirez's third run-scoring hit was an RBI single in the eighth that pushed Texas ahead 12-8, which was just enough.	Jamey Wright (6-4), the third of five Rangers pitchers, allowed a run over 1 2/3 innings.	After a quick groundout and an infield single on the first two pitches by rookie left-hander Matt Harrison, Quentin hit his 21st homer. Dye walked and scored on a grounder to make it 3-0.	Chicago's Juan Uribe, playing for resting All-Star third baseman Joe Crede, tripled and scored on Orlando Cabrera's single in the second. Uribe's ball hit on top of the 14-foot wall in left field, bounced straight up and then fell back into play.	Game notes	 White Sox closer Bobby Jenks begins a rehabilitation assignment Monday for Class-A Winston-Salem. He is expected to pitch for Double-A Birmingham on Wednesday and rejoin Chicago from the disabled list (bursitis near non-pitching shoulder) the first game after the All-Star break. ... Chicago C A.J. Pierzynski was out of the lineup, as scheduled before he got hit on the lower left leg by a pitch and left Saturday night's game. The team said he had a bruise.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Reggie Willits' aggressive baserunning is a result of coaches past and present instilling in him that instinct. Sometimes it's pure luck.	Willits scored from second on Erick Aybar's infield single with two outs in the ninth and the Los Angeles Angels rallied to beat the Oakland Athletics 4-3 on Sunday, spoiling another solid outing by All-Star Justin Duchscherer.	Willits, who entered the game as a pinch runner, never stopped running from second base on the play. Aybar's high chopper eluded closer Huston Street's glove, and shortstop Donnie Murphy's throw to first baseman Daric Barton was late. Willits just beat the throw home, which dribbled away from Kurt Suzuki.	"In that situation, all the way up through the minor leagues we're trained to just go as hard as we can possibly can go," Willits said. "My thinking with two outs is I'm going on contact. It wasn't hit hard, and usually you're looking for a throw that pulls the first baseman off the bag. It doesn't happen too often."	Said Barton: "I turned to throw but Kurt was looking up the line. If I would have thrown it that first time we would have had him. I saw him round third and I know he's fast. I've seen him take third on bunts."	Casey Kotchman hit a home run and Howie Kendrick drove in two runs to help the Angels record their 19th comeback win and improve to a major-league best 36-19 in games decided by two runs or less.	"Any team that has speed is going to try and use it," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "When you're on second base and there's a ball hit that looks like there's a possibility the runner's going to beat it, you're going to run through the bag hard to see if anything develops. Fortunately for us, he double-clutched and Reggie was able to get in there."	Francisco Rodriguez got out of a bases-loaded jam in the ninth for his major-league leading 38th save in 41 chances.	Torii Hunter and Juan Rivera singled to open the ninth against Street (2-3), who blew his fourth save. Kendrick hit a sacrifice fly to tie the game.	Jose Arredondo (3-0) pitched a scoreless eighth for the win.	Jack Cust had two hits, including his 18th home run, a solo shot off Darren Oliver in the sixth, and ended his strikeout streak at 19 games. He also avoided tying the AL record for most strikeouts before the All-Star break, 115 by Bo Jackson with the Kansas City Royals in 1987.	Duchscherer's lost one streak and continued another, and the A's fell six games behind the AL West-leading Angels.	Duchscherer, selected to his second All-Star Game, had a career-best 18-inning scoreless streak end when Kendrick beat the throw to first on a two-out grounder in the fourth, allowing Vladimir Guerrero to score.	The Oakland right-hander extended his streak of allowing three earned runs or fewer to 19 games, matching the Oakland record, last accomplished by Ken Holtzman in 1974-75. He allowed two runs and five hits over 7 2/3 innings. He walked two and struck out three.	Kotchman homered to hasten the end of Duchscherer's outing in the eighth. Brad Ziegler got the final out of the eighth.	Dustin Moseley gave the Angels a solid outing, giving up two runs, both in the first inning, and four hits over 5 1/3 innings. He walked one and struck out four.	Moseley, working on three days rest, was recalled from Triple-A Salt Lake to take Joe Saunders' spot in the rotation. Saunders was with his wife Shanel on Saturday night in the L.A. area as she delivered the couple's first child, Matea.	"I just treat it as any other start," Moseley said. "I've had a lot of success last year coming out of the pen and starting. I try to go back to my experiences where I've done well. That's where I was, three days rest, flying in late last night, no real time to prepare, just do my best and see what happens."	Moseley gave up hits to four of the first five batters he faced, with Emil Brown and Carlos Gonzalez each singling home a run. He retired 14 of the last 15 batters he faced.	Game notes	 Duchscherer walked two batters or fewer for the 15th time in 16 starts this season. ... A's manager Bob Geren announced the A's will open the second half with a rotation of RHP Joe Blanton, LHP Greg Smith, Duchscherer, RHP Sean Gallagher and LHP Dana Eveland. ... Scioscia said RHP John Lackey would start the second half of the season and the rest of the rotation would depend on how Saunders and RHP Ervin Santana are used in the All-Star Game. ... A's 2B Mark Ellis enters the break with a 46-game errorless streak and leads AL second basemen with a .995 fielding percentage. ... Angels INF Sean Rodriguez was optioned to Triple-A Salt Lake to make room for Moseley. ... The Angels own the best road record in baseball (30-19) despite losing 7 of their last 11 away from Anaheim.

SAN DIEGO (AP) -- All-Star catcher Brian McCann says he likes being "locked in." His Atlanta Braves teammates like him that way, too.	McCann homered and drove in three runs to help the Braves rout the San Diego Padres 12-3 on Sunday in the rubber game of the three-game series.	McCann, who made the All-Star team for the third time, extended his on-base streak to eight straight plate appearances. That includes three walks Saturday night and a walk and hit by pitch along with his 3-for-3 on Sunday.	"It's good to be locked in. You try to stay locked in as long as you can, because you know that at some point, you're gonna come out of it," McCann said. "Baseball's up and down. I was down for about two or three weeks where I wasn't hitting anything. That's just baseball."	McCann hit his 18th home run off of Padres reliever Josh Banks in the seventh inning. That was after his RBI single in the Braves three-run first inning and before his RBI double in a three-run ninth.	"I think Brian is one of those cerebral hitters who's able to make adjustments on the fly," said Chipper Jones, who will join McCann at the All-Star Game. "Not everyone can do that."	Braves manager Bobby Cox notched his 2,300 career win, fourth all-time among managers.	"Oh, I didn't know that. Now I can tell my wife. She always asks me, and I never have a clue," Cox said.	"We hit the ball pretty good today. I think this will give them a good feeling for a four-day break."	The Braves went into the break at 45-50, 6 1/2 games behind the Phillies in the NL East. It marked just the third time in the last 18 seasons that the Braves have reached the All-Star break below .500.	The woeful Padres lost their second straight and are 37-58, 10 games behind Arizona in the NL West. They are 23-30 at home and 14-28 on the road.	"It would have been good to get to the break with a 'W' today," Padres manager Bud Black said. "But they broke out today."	Black is headed to the All-Star Game as the NL pitching coach, along with his first baseman Adrian Gonzalez.	Atlanta rookie Jorge Campillo, who had more than 40 family and friends from his home town of Tijuana at the game, tossed six strong innings to even his record at 4-4. He had to leave the game in the top of the seventh when he fouled a pitch off his left foot.	Mark Teixeira had two doubles and two RBIs, and Brent Lillibridge went 3-for-5 with two RBIs.	The Braves took a 3-0 lead in the first on Teixeira's two-run double off Padres starter Randy Wolf (6-9). Atlanta chased Wolf with a five-run sixth inning that featured five singles, and tacked on three more runs in the ninth.	Wolf gave up six runs and six hits in five innings.	Braves starter Tim Hudson made his first Major League relief appearance in his nine year career, pitching a perfect eighth. He had made 301 previous starts.	Kevin Kouzmanoff, who had three hits, drove in two of the Padres runs with an RBI single in the first and his 12th home run in sixth off Campillo. Rookie Chase Headley hit his sixth home run, a 434-foot blast off reliever Mike Gonzalez in the ninth.	That home run snapped a 62-inning homerless streak by Braves relievers, dating back to June 22 vs. Seattle.	The 12 runs were the most the Braves have scored since May 21, when they beat the Mets 11-4 in Atlanta.	Game notes	 McCann leads all major league catchers with 18 home runs and 27 doubles. He has 53 RBIs and is hitting .302. ... After going 0-for-2 with one run scored, one RBI, one sacrifice fly and two walks, Jones is now hitting .397 on the road this season (23-for-58) with three doubles, six home runs, 12 RBIS and 18 runs scored. He leads the majors in hitting at .376. ... Kouzmanoff has now hit safely in 17 of his last 21 games for the Padres and is hitting .341 over that 21-game stretch with nine doubles, one triple, four homers and 12 RBIs. It was his 16th three-hit or more game.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The best thing about the Los Angeles Dodgers this season has been their pitching staff. Their most consistent starter has been Chad Billingsley.	The 23-year-old right-hander struck out a career-high 13 without walking a batter Sunday, and the Dodgers used a six-run first inning to beat the Florida Marlins 9-1 and avoid a four-game sweep.	"We felt like we felt like we were heading in the right direction because we had won four straight series before this one," manager Joe Torre said. "I mean, I don't think this has knocked us off course. It's just been frustrating. Overall, our pitching has been good and it continues to be good."	Billingsley (9-8) allowed a run and five hits over seven innings. The three-year veteran, who was selected in the first round of the 2003 draft, goes into the All-Star break with a 3.25 ERA and is 5-1 in his last six starts.	"I started off kind of slow this year. But, personally, I didn't feel like I was throwing that bad," said Billingsley, who leads the staff in wins.	"I was having some tough breaks, but I was able to finish up the first half strong. My offspeed stuff has been great recently. Hopefully, I can just carry this into the second half so we can make a run at this thing. We're right there, and we still haven't played our best ball yet. So it'll be fun in the second half."	The Dodgers are 46-49 in their first season under Torre, compared to 49-40 at the break last season under Grady Little. They trail Arizona by one game in the NL West, the same deficit they faced at the break last year. They resume their schedule with a three-game series against the Diamondbacks at Phoenix.	"Our record is less than I hoped for, and I'm disappointed that we don't have more wins under our belt. But I'm grateful that Arizona's going through the same thing," second baseman Jeff Kent said.	Los Angeles was as many as seven games off the pace on April 25. But the defending division champion Diamondbacks weren't able to capitalize on a 5-14 slide by the Dodgers from May 26 through June 15.	"When we were seven games back, there was a lot of disappointment among the players in here," Kent said. "But the way we've been making up ground in the standings is keeping guys excited. We've gained 95 games of experience now from the losses we had in the first half, and I think we're better off for it."	Dodgers closer Takashi Saito, whose ninth-inning stint on Saturday night was cut short because of tightness in his right elbow, will have an MRI on Monday.	"I think you've got to assume the worst," Torre said. "But with the All-Star break here, there's really no decision-making that has to be made immediately. So let's see what happens."	Saito's injury only clouds the picture for the Dodgers, who have had 12 players do time on the disabled list -- including starters Brad Penny and Jason Schmidt, shortstop Rafael Furcal and left fielder Juan Pierre.	"Injuries have been a crutch for us, I think," Kent said. "I hate to use them as excuses because good teams should be able to overcome the injuries we've had this year. We had another one last night with Saito, and I don't know how long that's going to take. We're a better team with him. But if we don't have him, we're going to have to find somebody to step up."	Billingsley gave up his only run on a first-inning RBI double by former Dodger Luis Gonzalez, then retired 15 of his next 16 batters -- 10 of them on strikeouts. The previous high by a Dodger this season was 12 -- by Billingsley on April 24 against Arizona.	Hanley Ramirez, scheduled to start at shortstop in Tuesday's All-Star Game, was held out of the Marlins' lineup for precautionary reasons after leaving Saturday night's game with a sore right shoulder -- although he was available to pinch-hit.	The Marlins, who had won six of their previous seven games, come into the break with a 50-45 record -- quite a turnaround for a club that finished the 2007 season 20 games under .500 and last in the NL East. They are 1½ games behind first-place Philadelphia.	"To people on the outside, I think we've overachieved," Gonzalez said. "I think we've surprised the baseball world -- just as Tampa Bay has. I think everybody's still waiting for both teams to falter, but we continue to go out there and surprise people. And that's what makes it very exciting and fun for our club."	Andrew Miller (5-9) lost his fourth straight decision, allowing seven runs, five hits and a season-high five walks in just 1 2/3 innings -- the second-shortest of his 33 career starts. The 23-year-old right-hander lasted only two-thirds of an inning in his first big league start on Aug. 29, 2007 with Detroit.	Miller didn't retire a batter in the rematch until his 31st pitch. The first six Dodgers all reached base and scored.	Matt Kemp led off the inning with a single and scored when second baseman Dan Uggla lost Nomar Garciaparra's bases-loaded popup in the sun. Garciaparra was credited with a hit, and James Loney added a two-run single after a walk to Andruw Jones.	Garciaparra came home on a groundout by Andy LaRoche, and Loney scored the sixth run on a suicide-squeeze by Luis Maza.

NEW YORK (AP) -- Jerry Manuel insisted that the All-Star break was coming at a good time for the Mets. A chance to rest a tired bullpen and maybe get some banged up guys back.	Then Carlos Beltran hit a three-run homer Sunday night, Mike Pelfrey dominated over eight innings and New York pounded the Colorado Rockies 7-0 for a ninth straight win.	Care to reconsider?	"I'm really looking forward to getting the second half going," Manuel said, smiling. "The way our pitching staff is going right now, I'm very excited about what's to come."	The Mets were 5½ games back in the NL East on July 4. But after a tumultuous first half that included Manuel replacing the fired Willie Randolph, they'll resume play Thursday at Cincinnati trailing division-leading Philadelphia by just a half-game.	New York's nine-game run is its best since April 16-25, 2000.	"The confidence that the team has right now is just kind of permeating through the clubhouse," Manuel said. "We're playing good baseball."	A big reason is pitching. The Mets have allowed just four runs over their last six games, capped by Pelfrey's sixth straight win and second straight shutout.	Mixing a four-seam fastball with a sharp sinker, Pelfrey (8-6) allowed only six hits and didn't walk a batter for the second consecutive game.	The big right-hander began laboring in the eighth, though, putting runners on first and second with two outs. But with the crowd chanting his name, Pelfrey got Scott Podsednik to pop out to third base.	"That was awesome. Last year I remember walking off the mound several times getting booed," said Pelfrey, who was 3-8 in 2007. "I never imagined it like this, but I never thought I wasn't capable of it."	Joe Smith worked the ninth to run the streak of scoreless innings by Mets relievers to 19 1/3. Still, the seven hits by Colorado snapped New York's string of allowing three or fewer in a record five straight games.	While the Mets sure seem as if they'd rather be playing Monday, the Rockies looked as if they were already on a break. They've lost four straight and 11 of 13 on the road.	"Score one run in three games? You're not going to win much," said Clint Hurdle, who'll stick around New York to manage the National League in Tuesday night's All-Star Game. "We have to give them credit. We were playing good ball coming in here."	Making his third start since replacing the injured Jeff Francis in the rotation, Mark Redman (2-5) ran into trouble from the start.	Nick Evans got aboard with a one-out base hit, David Wright followed with a walk and Beltran drove a 1-2 pitch an estimated 415 feet to left field for a 3-0 lead in the first.	Jose Reyes added a run-scoring single in the second and Evans a sacrifice fly in the fourth, driving Redman from the game after five runs and eight hits in 3 1/3 innings.	"I didn't put us in a good position, putting us in a three-run deficit in the first inning," said Redman, winless since April 16. "That's not what you want to do."	Carlos Delgado added a two-run homer in the fifth, but by then the Rockies were already on their way to finishing the first half 39-57. It's the third-worst record at the All-Star break for a team coming off a World Series appearance in a non-strike year, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.	The 1998 Marlins were 32-55 at the break and the '79 Dodgers were 36-57.	Colorado's best chance to score came in the fourth when Matt Holliday and Brad Hawpe hit consecutive one-out singles. Garrett Atkins dribbled a grounder to third baseman Wright, who threw to Damion Easley at second to start a double play.	Easley had trouble fielding the low throw but still got it to Delgado at first in time for the out. Hurdle came out to question whether Easley was pulled off the bag, which would have allowed a run to score, but umpire Chuck Meriwether promptly sent the manager back to the dugout with little argument.	"It's coming at a good time," Hurdle said of the All-Star break. "We sure won't miss this place."	Game notes	 Pelfrey hasn't allowed a run in a career-best 16 innings. ... Rockies RHP Kip Wells, who had surgery to remove a blood clot in his hand, will make one more rehab start Wednesday at Double-A Tulsa, Hurdle said. ... There was a moment of silence before the game for Bobby Murcer, the former Yankees great who died Saturday at the age of 62.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball's All-Stars came to say goodbye to Yankee Stadium -- and what a long, long goodbye it was.	In a game that started Tuesday night and faded well into Wednesday, Justin Morneau slid home just in time on Michael Young's sacrifice fly in the 15th inning, giving the American League a 4-3 victory that extended its unbeaten streak to 12.	Young ended a 4-hour, 50-minute marathon at 1:37 a.m., with the grand old ballpark half-empty. It was a good thing, too -- neither team had any pitchers left in the bullpen, but this one was not going to end in another tie.	"It was just crazy how it seemed like it lasted forever," Texas' Ian Kinsler said. "It was the last year for Yankee Stadium, the last All-Star Game, and it's kind of fitting that it seemed like it lasted forever."	The NL was given a pregame pep talk by Hall of Famer Ernie Banks, whose motto is: "Let's play two!" And they nearly did, matching the NL's 2-1 win at Anaheim in 1967 for the longest All-Star Game ever.	"Yankee Stadium is tough, I'm telling you," Yankees closer Mariano Rivera said. "Didn't want it to end."	Morneau started the winning rally with a leadoff single against loser Brad Lidge. After Dioner Navarro singled with one out, J.D. Drew walked to load the bases.	Young lofted a fly to right, and Corey Hart's throw home took two bounces and was slightly to the first-base side of the plate. Catcher Brian McCann gloved the ball and tried a sweep tag, but Morneau sneaked his right foot in, barely ahead of the tag.	Plate umpire Derryl Cousins made the safe call, and the AL players left in the dugout rushed out to celebrate.	"It was a little deep for me," Hart said. "I was just trying to get it as close as I could."	The AL improved to 6-0 since the All-Star Game began determining homefield advantage in the World Series and 10-0-1 since its 1996 loss in Philadelphia. And it even ended an old hex -- it had been 0-9-1 in extra innings against its older rival.	Still, the NL leads 40-37-2 overall	Young, who got a ninth-inning, go-ahead hit off Trevor Hoffman in 2006 at Pittsburgh, helped avoid a repeat of 2002, when the game at Milwaukee ended in a 7-7, 12-inning tie and caused the commissioner's office to expand the rosters. The winner was Tampa Bay's Scott Kazmir, the 12th AL pitcher.	"I've been in a lot off one-inning situations this year, so I'm not sure how long I could have gone," said Lidge, the 11th NL hurler. "I know nobody would have wanted to start marching position players out there to decide who has home-field advantage in the World Series."	Drew was picked as the MVP, with his two-run homer in the seventh making it 2-all. Being from Boston, he was booed when presented with his trophy. The only other AL player with an All-Star ending RBI was Red Sox great Ted Williams, who hit a three-run, ninth-inning homer in 1941.	"One of those undescribable events," said Drew, who was prepared to be an emergency pitcher.	This one had nearly everything a fan could ask for -- a Yankees fan, that is.	The pinstriped crowd got to boo Boston's Jonathan Papelbon and the Mets' Billy Wagner. The fans showed their love for Rivera and Derek Jeter.	Matt Holliday and Drew hit home runs. Houston shortstop Miguel Tejada made a great, falling throw on a slow grounder to deny the AL a win in the 10th after a pair of ugly errors by Dan Uggla, who made a record three botches in all.	The AL left the potential winning run at third base in the 10th, 11th and 12th innings. Uggla twice stranded what would have been the go-ahead run on third.	Colorado's Aaron Cook wiggled out of bases-loaded, no-out jam in the 10th. Grady Sizemore and Evan Longoria grounded into forceouts at the plate, and Tejada made a charging, flying throw to get Morneau on a slow grounder.	In the 11th, Pittsburgh center fielder Nate McLouth made a perfect throw to nail Navarro at the plate on Young's single, with Dodgers catcher Russell Martin applying the tag.	The NL loaded the bases with one out in the 12th before Kansas City's Joakim Soria struck out Uggla, and Baltimore's George Sherrill fanned Adrian Gonzalez.	For much of the past few days, the question that hung over the game was whether AL manager Terry Francona would use Papelbon to close or Rivera, regarded as perhaps the greatest relief pitcher ever. Papelbon, while praising his rival, said Monday that he wanted the ball.	That caused an angry responses, and Red Sox players were greeted with profanities Tuesday during a red-carpet parade up Manhattan's Avenue of the Americas.	"I had my kids with me, so there was probably a few choice words that we wouldn't like a 6- and an 8-year-old to hear for an hour," Papelbon said. "But it's part of what goes on in the rivalry between the Yankees and Red Sox."	When Papelbon entered the game, he was mocked with chants of "Mariano!" and "Overrated!"	He gave up a leadoff single to Tejada, and was booed. Tejada stole second with, went to third as Navarro's throw went into center field for an error and scored on Gonzalez's sacrifice fly.	Wagner relieved with two outs in the bottom of the eighth, gave up a single to Sizemore, who stole second and scored on a ground-rule double down the left-field line by Longoria.	A sellout crowd of 55,632 came to honor the 85-year-old ballpark, home to Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle and the most glittering lineup of greats any team can boast.	Holliday's fifth-inning homer against Ervin Santana and Lance Berkman's sixth-inning sacrifice fly off Oakland's Justin Duchscherer made it 2-0 before tied it against Dan Haren.	Prior to the game, 49 Hall of Famers led by Yogi Berra and Gary Carter walked in from the bullpens in left-center to their former positions, waved to the sellout crowd and stood as the All-Stars assumed flanking positions alongside them during a half-hour ceremony.	George Steinbrenner, who has owned the Yankees since 1973, delivered the balls for the ceremonial first pitches on a golf cart. The 78-year-old, whose health has deteriorated in recent years, wore sunglasses and was accompanied by wife Joan, son Hal and son-in-law Felix Lopez, his assistant and a driver. Berra, Whitey Ford, Reggie Jackson and Goose Gossage hugged the Boss before throwing balls to Jeter, Rodriguez, Rivera and Yankees manager Joe Girardi.	Game notes	 The previous longest game by time was 1967, which took 3:41. ... Drew became the 15th player to homer in his first All-Star at-bat, the first since the Mets' David Wright two years ago. ... Zambrano started Manny Ramirez with a playful breaking ball over his head in the fourth. ... There were an AL record-tying six steals and a record seven overall. ... The NL was 0-for-6 with runners in scoring position, the AL 3-for-22. ... The Hall of Fame collected two souvenirs -- Rivera's jersey and dirt from the pitcher's mound.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

BALTIMORE (AP) -- A few words of advice went a long way for Gary Sheffield -- say, around 750 feet.	Sheffield hit one home run and was robbed of another, and the Detroit Tigers also got homers from Brandon Inge and Marcus Thames in a 6-5 victory over the Baltimore Orioles on Thursday night.	Tigers manager Jim Leyland was shopping for clothes in New York during the All-Star break when someone he described only as a former "great player" offered a few tips on how Sheffield could improve his swing.	After a horrendous first half in which he batted .217 with five homers and 18 RBIs, Sheffield wasn't about to reject any suggestion. So he acted upon the suggestion after conferring with Leyland and hitting coach Lloyd McClendon.	"A lot of people feel like I've been doing it my way for 20 years," Sheffield said. "... But like I say, `If you see something, say something.' I'm not one of those guys who's not approachable. I try to take advice from everybody else."	The results were immediate: The slugger hit a two-run homer in his first at-bat and in the eighth he hit a liner that cleared the wall but was snagged by left fielder Jay Payton, who made a perfectly timed leap.	"I don't want Sheff to change. ... We just talked about it, suggested it," Leyland said. "It wasn't a total adjustment for him. He lowered his hands a little bit."	With Sheffield leading the way, the Tigers opened the second half in much the same fashion they arrived at the All-Star break. After hitting 17 home runs in their first 12 games in July, Detroit picked up the pace against the Orioles.	"They live a lot with the home run ball and we didn't keep the ball in the ballpark," Orioles manager Dave Trembley said. "So that was a negative for us."	Baltimore absorbed its ninth straight loss in a game decided by one run -- including six during a 1-8 stretch that has dropped the Orioles four games under .500 (45-49) for the first time this season.	Melvin Mora homered and Baltimore had 14 hits, but went 4-for-11 with runners in scoring position and stranded nine.	"Yeah, we had our chances. Swinging the bats good all night long and we had some first-and-third situations with less than two outs, we didn't get runners across," said Kevin Millar, who had two hits but made the final out with runners at the corners. "We battled, but we just couldn't get that tying run."	Kenny Rogers (7-6) allowed four runs and 11 hits in six gritty innings for the Tigers, who moved within 6 1/2 games of first-place Chicago in the AL Central. Detroit has won 24 of 35 since June 6.	"This is when it all counts," Sheffield said. "You want to make it all right in the second half, get off to a good start and go from there."	Todd Jones, the fifth Detroit pitcher, worked the ninth for his 18th save. After Aubrey Huff hit a one-out, bases-loaded sacrifice fly, Jones retired Millar on a grounder to third.	Baltimore starter Garrett Olson (6-5) gave up five runs, seven hits and four walks in six innings.	Inge gave the Tigers a 5-4 lead in the sixth with his seventh homer following a two-out single by Edgar Renteria. It was his first home run on the road since May 17, 2007, at Boston.	Baltimore got runners at the corners with no outs in the bottom half, but Ramon Hernandez got caught in a rundown after breaking to the plate on a grounder by Brandon Fahey, and Brian Roberts hit into a 5-3 double play.	That ended Rogers' night, but the 43-year-old stuck around long enough to earn his 217th victory, tied with former Detroit star Mickey Lolich for 19th place on the career list among left-handers.	"They got a lot of hits pretty much most innings, but I got out of those jams," Rogers said. "Some days you have to give them credit. Their approach was good, they went out and got a few pitches and I did make some mistakes."	Thames connected off Dennis Sarfate in the seventh to make it 6-4.	Sheffield put the Tigers up 2-0 in the second with his 486th career homer -- the first since June 26 -- following a walk to Miguel Cabrera.	Baltimore used four straight hits to pull even in the bottom half, including a run-scoring double by Mora and an RBI single by Hernandez.	Each team scored a run in the third, and Mora's 12th homer put Baltimore ahead for the first time, 4-3 in the fourth. Rogers avoided further damage by striking out Adam Jones with the bases loaded and two outs.	Game notes	 Detroit RF Magglio Ordonez, activated from the DL before the game after being sidelined since June 29 with a pulled oblique muscle, went 1-for-5. ... Jones had two hits and has reached base safely in 17 straight games. ... Sheffield's homer gave him 1,596 RBIs, lifting him past Mike Schmidt into 31st place on the career list.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

CINCINNATI (AP) -- Ten straight wins and a share of first place. The New York Mets don't look like a $138 million disappointment anymore.	Right now, they're golden.	David Wright's two-run homer in the ninth inning sparked New York's biggest comeback of the season Thursday night, a 10-8 victory over the Cincinnati Reds that extended Mets' winning streak to 10 games and brought them a share of first place in the NL East.	Playing on the one-month anniversary of manager Willie Randolph's firing, the Mets blew three leads before coming full-circle with four runs in the ninth.	"We've been taking such a beating all year long for how we play the game and what we've done wrong and what little we've done right," closer Billy Wagner said. "I love seeing guys who told us two weeks ago how bad we stunk, and now they're going, 'Well, you're in first place.' Yeah."	They were 6 1/2 games out when they changed managers, fearful that they were playing themselves out of contention with an underachieving offense. Their 10th straight win completed the turnaround -- they're tied for first with Philadelphia, back in the top spot for the first time since April 19.	That once-balky offense made it possible.	Down to their last two outs, the Mets rallied against Francisco Cordero (4-2), who blew a save for the fifth time in 24 chances, getting six straight hits against the closer.	Argenis Reyes singled, and Wright -- an All-Star designated hitter at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday night -- hit a tying homer to right field that barely eluded the glove of leaping Ken Griffey Jr.	That was the spark they needed.	"My slider maybe wasn't good enough," Cordero said. "It was one of those nights. Whatever I threw to home plate was going to get hit."	Carlos Delgado had a tiebreaking single off Cordero, smacking his hands and pumping his firsts as he rounded first base. Fernando Tatis doubled home another run to complete the comeback.	Those three accounted for all the Mets' runs. Delgado and Tatis had two-run homers off Red starter Johnny Cueto, and Wright had a two-run single.	It was the first time this season the Mets overcame a three-run deficit and won. It was also the first time they rallied for two runs in the ninth to pull one out.	"Winning nine in a row helps," Wright said of the comeback. "The biggest thing is you win nine in a row and you get that confidence, that ideal that you're never out of a game. That's what happened today."	It appeared that the streak -- now matching Minnesota for the longest in the majors this season -- was about to end when Javier Valentin hit a bases-loaded double in the seventh for an 8-6 lead. Pitching has been the foundation for the Mets' winning streak -- four shutouts in the six previous games -- but Johan Santana and the bullpen repeatedly failed in this one.	"It was one of those days where whatever you do doesn't go the way you want," Santana said.	The Reds scored five runs off Santana in the fourth, piling up a single, a double, a two-run triple by Jeff Keppinger and solo homers by Adam Dunn and Edwin Encarnacion. It was Dunn's 27th homer and sixth in the last eight games.	It wasn't nearly enough against the majors' hottest team.	"That hurts big-time," Reds manager Dusty Baker said. "We played so hard, but we made some mistakes."	Duaner Sanchez (4-1) escaped a scoring threat in the eighth. Wagner pitched a perfect ninth for his 23rd save in 29 chances, wiping away the bad taste of his latest All-Star appearance. The left-hander gave up an RBI double in the eighth inning at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday night, helping the American League rally for a win that gives it home-field advantage once again in the World Series.	So, the streak goes on, now one shy of the club record. The Mets have won 11 straight four times, most recently in June 1990.	"Momentum is one of those strange things," Mets manager Jerry Manuel said. "You can't identify it until it's over. I guess we still have it."	Game notes	 Delgado's homer was his 449th, tying Jeff Bagwell for 33rd on the career list. ... The last time the Mets won 10 straight was in July 1991. ... Mets RHP Pedro Martinez will miss his scheduled start Sunday against the Reds. He got an injection Thursday to help his groin strain heal. He could start Tuesday against Philadelphia. ... RHP Mike Pelfrey will start in Martinez's place Sunday. Pelfrey hasn't allowed a run in his last 16 innings. ... The Reds put INF Jerry Hairston Jr. on the 15-day DL with a pulled hamstring and activated INF Jolbert Cabrera off the DL. Cabrera dislocated his left index finger sliding into a base on June 21. ... Encarnacion had three hits and extended his hitting streak to five games. He's 11-for-19 during the streak.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Jake Peavy hopes he gave up four homers in a game for the last time. His manager is sure of it.	Troy Glaus homered twice and Rick Ankiel and Joe Mather added solo shots of their own to help the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Padres 4-3 Thursday night.	"I'm going to go on the record and say that'll never happen again in Jake's career," Padres manager Bud Black said. "Normally, I tell my pitchers solos don't beat you, but tonight they did."	The Cardinals never even had a runner in scoring position.	It was only the second time in his seven-year career that Peavy (7-6) allowed four homers in a game. The other was July 9, 2003, at Arizona. He gave up eight hits and struck out seven in seven innings.	"Solo home runs can't beat you but you can't give up four of them on the night," Peavy said. "It was just one of those things. I wasn't aggressive enough."	Kyle Lohse (12-2) won his ninth straight decision, the most for St. Louis since Chris Carpenter won 13 in a row in 2005. Lohse pitched seven innings, allowing two runs, seven hits and two walks while striking out four.	"A lot goes into a winning streak," Lohse said. "They play great defense behind me and score runs."	Ryan Franklin pitched the ninth for his 13th save in 17 opportunities. He gave up a run on consecutive doubles by Kevin Kouzmanoff and Chase Headley before retiring the next three batters, stranding the tying run at third base.	"This guy has great guts," St. Louis manager Tony La Russa said. "That was a clutch recovery."	Glaus tied it at 1 in the second, snapping Peavy's 15-inning scoreless streak. The Cardinals took a 3-2 lead in the fourth on back-to-back shots by Ankiel and Glaus.	"When I was in the AL West, I faced him a lot," Glaus said. "He comes at you hard and fortunately, we were able to take advantage of a couple of mistakes. He didn't put them exactly where he wanted them."	Mather, a rookie pinch-hitting for Lohse, homered in the seventh.	"I've had a chance to get used to this role," Mather said. "He was pretty dirty through the whole game. I thought he'd try and get ahead of me and sneak one in there but he left one up. I was aggressive and looking for a fastball. I got it."	Glaus has hit four home runs in his last 16 at-bats. It was his 27th multihomer game and second this season. He did it July 2 against the New York Mets.	"It's getting warmer," Glaus said. "That's baseball. It's just a good stretch now."	Game notes	 San Diego has lost three straight and six of their last eight games. ... St. Louis became the fifth major league club to top the 2-million mark in attendance with a sold-out crowd of 42,148. ... This was the third time his season the Padres have allowed four homers in a game. It also happened April 2 against Houston and May 19 against St. Louis.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

DENVER (AP) -- The Colorado Rockies expected Chris Iannetta to be their catcher of the future in 2007.	A year later, he's living up to that promise.	Iannetta hit a broken-bat, two-run homer in the sixth and drove in three runs and Ubaldo Jimenez pitched seven innings to help the Rockies snap a four-game losing streak with a 5-3 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Thursday night.	Iannetta was the Rockies' opening-day catcher last year before losing the job to Yorvit Torrealba. He didn't play during Colorado's run to the World Series, but he has emerged as the starter this season.	"I didn't feel like myself and I couldn't explain why," said Iannetta, who hit just .218 last year and spent time in Triple-A. "I'd swing at balls that I would normally hit well and swing right through it. This year I'm getting the same pitches and I'm able to barrel them up."	This year he's hitting .281 and feeling confident. He's also showing more power. His sixth-inning home run broke a 3-all tie, and it came off of a bat Iannetta said he cracked in his previous at-bat.	"I think the bat was already broken. Maple bats, you can't always tell," he said. "I hit it good. I was a little surprised the bat broke."	So was Pirates starter Paul Maholm.	"I don't know what to say," said Maholm, who struck out seven and didn't walk a batter. "I throw a first-pitch changeup away, he breaks his bat and he hits it 10 rows deep. There's nothing I can do about that."	Until the sixth inning, Maholm (6-6) was on his way to his fifth straight victory. But he surrendered a 3-2 lead on doubles by Jeff Baker and Garrett Atkins, and one pitch later Iannetta homered to left.	"I made some bad pitches," said Maholm, who lost for the first time since dropping a 7-2 decision to Milwaukee on May 20. "You want to get a guy to snap his bat. Usually when you get a guy out in front of a pitch and he breaks his bat, the ball stays in the park."	That was enough for Jimenez, who struggled early in the game but settled down. Jimenez (5-9) threw 70 pitches through the first three innings and then retired 11 of the last 12 batters he faced on 39 pitches. The only batter to reach after the third inning was wiped out in an inning-ending double play in the sixth.	"I was able to pitch inside to hitters," said Jimenez, who had four strikeouts and two walks.	His roughest inning was the third. With two outs, Nate McLouth scored on a wild pitch, and after Jason Bay walked to put runners on first and second, Adam LaRoche doubled to the gap in right-center field to score Bay and Freddy Sanchez and make it 3-0.	"In the third you saw two walks, a hit batter and a wild pitch," Rockies manager Clint Hurdle said. "It's a good sign he was able to recover."	The Pirates had two baserunners after the third inning, and Brian Fuentes struck out the side in the ninth for his 15th save this season and 100th of his career.	"You've got to be good to get 100," Hurdle said. "They don't hand them out."	The Rockies got two runs back in the third when Willy Taveras led off with a single and scored on Baker's double to right. Two outs later, Iannetta singled up the middle to drive in Baker and make it 3-2.	Game notes	 The Pirates recalled RHP Marino Salas from Triple-A Indianapolis on Thursday. ... Rockies RHP Kip Wells could be activated from the DL on Monday. Wells, out since April 29 for surgery to remove a blood clot from his pitching hand, went 6 2/3 innings in a rehab assignment Wednesday at Double-A Tulsa. ... Baker had two doubles and two runs scored.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.	Jhoulys Chacín has agreed to a guaranteed $1.25 million, one-year contract with the Rockies.	The Milwaukee Brewers acquired infielder Mike Brosseau from the Tampa Bay Rays for minor league pitcher Evan Reifert on Saturday in a trade between division winners.

BALTIMORE (AP) -- After sputtering into the All-Star break in a 1-for-21 slump, Luke Scott assured Baltimore Orioles manager Dave Trembley there was no reason to worry.	According to Trembley, Scott said, "I'll get hot the second half. It's always been that way with me in my career."	Scott backed up those words Friday night, hitting two home runs to lead the Orioles past the Detroit Tigers 7-4.	Obtained from the Houston Astros in December, Scott has endured an up-and-down season with the Orioles. He was batting .324 on April 26, .262 on May 10, .281 on June 17 and .254 at the break.	"Everyone goes through it," Scott said of his hot-and-cold streaks. "I'm not immune to it. No one's immune to it. You've just got to take the highs with the lows. I believe that a big second half is coming."	Scott hit a solo shot in the second inning off Armando Galarraga and a game-clinching, two-run drive off Bobby Seay in the eighth. It was his second multihomer game of the season and fourth of his career.	Aubrey Huff and Melvin Mora also homered for the Orioles, who won for only the second time in 10 games.	Ivan Rodriguez went 4-for-4 with a homer and two RBIs for the Tigers. Detroit went down in order only once but hit into three double plays and was 4-for-15 with runners in scoring position.	"When you get 14 hits," Tigers manager Jim Leyland said, "you're supposed to get more than four runs."	Detroit's lack of clutch hitting, along with Baltimore's four home runs, was too much for the Tigers to overcome.	"Both played a big factor," left fielder Matt Joyce said. "Those home runs, they killed us. And you got to score runs."	Down 4-3, the Orioles rallied in the sixth against Galarraga (7-4). After Huff led off with a single, Mora hit a high drive down the line that bounced off the top of the left-field foul pole.	"You don't see it hit the top very often," Joyce said. "I was shocked."	It was Mora's 13th homer and second in two games.	"I'm happy it hit the pole. If it wasn't for that, I think they were going to call foul ball," he said.	Singles by Placido Polanco and Joyce leading off the seventh chased Baltimore starter Jeremy Guthrie (6-7). Chad Bradford then got Magglio Ordonez to hit into a double play before Miguel Cabrera grounded out.	After Detroit stranded a runner at second in the eighth against Jim Johnson, George Sherrill got three outs for his 29th save.	Guthrie won his third straight decision despite giving up four runs and a career-high 12 hits.	Galarraga, who allowed eight hits and five runs in 6 2/3 innings, is winless in five starts since June 18.	"Every bad pitch he threw, he paid for it," Leyland said.	Even the good pitches proved costly for Galarraga. In the first inning, the right-hander got Adam Jones to hit a popup that shortstop Edgar Rentaria dropped. Nick Markakis followed with an RBI double.	Rodriguez hit a two-run homer in the second, the first of his five this season with a runner on. Scott countered in the bottom half.	Detroit loaded the bases with one out in the third before Ordonez hit into a double play. Huff connected in the Orioles' half, his fifth homer in 13 games. He has 19 for the season, four more than he hit all last year.	The Tigers again filled the bases in the fourth, but this time they cashed in. Brandon Inge hit a run-scoring grounder before Curtis Granderson doubled in a run to make it 4-3.	Game notes	 Guthrie has allowed a team-high 16 home runs, one more than Daniel Cabrera. ... Ordonez went 2-for-5 to lift his career batting average at Camden Yards to .336. ... Jones has reached base safely in 18 consecutive games. ... Seay's streak of 10 straight scoreless outings ended.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike Mussina received plenty of support from the New York Yankees, and newcomer Richie Sexson was right in the middle of it.	Robinson Cano hit a three-run homer, Alex Rodriguez also connected and New York built an early cushion for Mussina in a 7-1 victory over the Oakland Athletics on Friday night.	Sexson hit an RBI single in his first at-bat with the Yankees, and Mussina (12-6) pitched six effective innings to tie Cleveland's Cliff Lee and fellow All-Star Joe Saunders of the Los Angeles Angels for most wins in the AL.	"We looked good today. If we can look like this every day, we've got a chance," Mussina said.	Mussina was left off the All-Star team for Tuesday night's showcase at Yankee Stadium, yet he's certainly pitched like one of baseball's best this season.	The 39-year-old right-hander allowed eight singles and a double, but pitched out of trouble and did not walk a batter for the eighth time this year. Relying on pinpoint control, he has 16 walks in 20 starts spanning 113 1/3 innings.	Mussina gave up an RBI groundout to Ryan Sweeney in the first, then settled in to finish with six strikeouts despite not throwing his deceptive changeup all game.	"That's just the way it evolved," Mussina said.	David Robertson struck out all three hitters in the seventh, Edwar Ramirez worked a perfect eighth and LaTroy Hawkins tossed a 1-2-3 ninth as New York pitchers combined to retire its final 14 batters -- seven on strikeouts.	Bobby Abreu added an RBI double for the Yankees and Rodriguez (three hits) had a run-scoring single off lefty Greg Smith (5-8), handed the ball when scheduled starter Joe Blanton was traded to Philadelphia on Thursday.	"I wasn't throwing on short rest or anything, so that was fine," Smith said after the shortest outing of his brief career. "There was a little bit of rust, but I'm not going to make excuses. I just didn't have it tonight."	The A's, who won six of their previous seven at Yankee Stadium, have lost three straight overall for the first time since dropping four in a row May 28-31.	New York, which began a stretch that includes 13 of 16 games at home, equaled a season high by winning its fifth consecutive home game.	Looking for another second-half surge to match last year, the Yankees scored six runs with two outs. They hope Sexson can provide some pop from the right side against left-handed pitching, and he delivered immediately with a two-out RBI single in the first that tied it at 1.	"It felt good," said Sexson, released by Seattle last week. "The hardest part was not seeing a pitcher for nine days."	That certainly didn't hinder him.	"He's a guy who's done a lot of good things in his career and we believe he's got a lot left," New York manager Joe Girardi said.	Cano followed with a single to right and Rodriguez barreled into catcher Kurt Suzuki -- a clean collision -- while trying to score. Suzuki, however, held onto Sweeney's strong throw for the third out.	Cano, hoping to rebound from a disappointing first half, put the Yankees up 4-1 by driving a 1-2 pitch to right-center with two outs in the third for his first homer since June 27.	It was his first shot at Yankee Stadium since May 8 against Cleveland.	"It should be a great second half for him," Girardi said. "He's a career .330-plus hitter after the All-Star break. Some hitters just take longer to get going."	That was more than enough for Mussina, who improved to 11-3 with a 3.00 ERA in his past 16 starts with career win No. 262. His 12th win of the season surpassed last year's total.	"We were swinging the bats well at the beginning, but then he started hitting spots and then they exploded on us offensively," said Oakland shortstop Bobby Crosby, activated from the disabled list before the game.
