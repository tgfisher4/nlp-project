BALTIMORE --  Nick Markakis had gotten in the habit of adjourning to the video room after games, looking for clues that might help him end a perplexing and prolonged slump.	He put off the exercise Friday night to address the flock of reporters in front of his locker -- a rare sight in the Baltimore Orioles clubhouse this season.	Markakis ended an extended power outage with a grand slam and a two-run double, Jake Arrieta took a no-hitter into the sixth inning and the surging Orioles beat the Tampa Bay Rays 7-0.	Markakis' third career slam, off rookie Jeremy Hellickson (7-4), put Baltimore up 5-0 in the second inning. Markakis had gone 88 at-bats without an extra-base hit since hitting a home run against Tampa Bay on May 15 and was mired in a 6-for-43 skid that dropped his batting average to .237.	He drove in two runs in the eighth off Andy Sonnanstine to establish a new career high in RBIs with six. He had six RBIs in his previous 27 games.	Asked if he was pleased, Markakis said, "I guess you could say it was a relief for me, but it was a relief for the whole team. We got a big hit in a big situation."	Poring over game film for hours and taking extra batting practice paid off, but there was no guarantee his resurgence would last into the weekend.	"There's still a lot more hard work to come," he said. "I'm feeling better, but I still don't feel like I'm where I need to be. I'm just going to keep plugging away."	J.J. Hardy hit his second leadoff homer for the Orioles, who have won four straight to get within a victory of .500 (31-32). Hardy reached base all five trips to the plate and scored three runs.	Arrieta (8-3) faced the minimum 15 batters through five innings, walking two, before Sam Fuld led off the sixth with a double. The right-hander said he was thinking about the no-hitter since early in the game.	"You know you haven't given up a hit," he said. "I've had a few outings like that, where you don't give up a hit until the fifth or sixth and you sit there and think what if? What if tonight is the night? But you don't really let that get to you."	He ended up allowing two hits over seven innings and moved into a tie with Boston's Jon Lester for the AL lead in wins.	Koji Uehara allowed one hit in the eighth and Mike Gonzalez worked a 30-pitch ninth to complete the three-hitter. It was the fewest hits Tampa Bay has mustered in a game this season.	Hellickson gave up five runs, a career high-tying seven hits and three walks in 5 2/3 innings. The right-hander was 6-1 with a 1.74 ERA in his previous seven starts and 3-0 with a 1.25 ERA lifetime against the Orioles, but neither trend continued in the worst outing of his big league career.	In his previous 15 starts, Hellickson allowed more than three earned runs only once -- four runs on April 17 against the Minnesota Twins. Not only did he yield more runs than ever before, but he also surrendered two homers in a game for the first time.	The one to Markakis, of course, hurt the most.	"I just made a really bad pitch, and he made me pay for it," Hellickson said. "It was the only pitch I was upset with -- and it's the biggest pitch of the game."	Hellickson fell behind after throwing two pitches, the second one a hanging curveball that Hardy drove into the left-field seats. In his first career start in the leadoff spot Tuesday, Hardy began the game with a home run against Oakland's Guillermo Moscoso.	Baltimore pulled away in the second. After a walk to Luke Scott, a double by Mark Reynolds and two-out walk to Hardy loaded the bases, Markakis hit a breaking pitch over the 25-foot scoreboard in right field.	Hellickson had given up only one home run in his previous six starts.	"He wasn't sharp, but he got through it," Tampa Bay manager Joe Maddon said.	There were few offensive highlights for the Rays, whose three-game winning streak ended.	Johnny Damon led off the first inning with a walk, extending to 35 his career-high streak of games reaching base -- the longest active run in the majors and two games short of Ben Grieve's club record (in 2001). But he was thrown out trying to steal second base.	Arrieta struck out the side in the third. In the fourth, Ben Zobrist walked but was wiped out in a double play.	The Rays threatened in the sixth. After Fuld's double, Justin Ruggiano got an infield hit and Reid Brignac popped out. Damon followed with a grounder up the middle that Arrieta tipped with his glove. Second baseman Robert Andino got the rebound with a backhanded grab and flipped the ball to shortstop Hardy, whose relay to first base completed the 1-4-6-3 double play.	Game notes	 The start of the game was delayed by rain for 1 hour, 8 minutes. ... Rays right fielder Matt Joyce was a late scratch, one day after getting a cortisone shot in his left shoulder. ... Tampa Bay third baseman Evan Longoria started for the first time since June 4. He was out with tightness in his left side and the flu. ... The Orioles recalled first baseman Brandon Snyder from Triple-A Norfolk to fill in for Derrek Lee, who was placed on the bereavement list Thursday and is expected to miss the entire three-game series.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DETROIT --  While Ichiro Suzuki restlessly took a night off, Carlos Peguero and the Seattle Mariners rallied to win without him.	Peguero homered and tripled starting in place of Suzuki in right field, and the Mariners beat the Detroit Tigers 3-2 on Friday night. The struggling Suzuki, who had played in 255 consecutive games, was given a chance to rest. Peguero, a rookie playing his 26th major league game, helped Seattle overcome a 2-1 deficit.	"I feel more relaxed," Peguero said. "My timing is better right now. I feel like I don't have to swing really, really hard to hit the ball far."	Peguero tripled in the fifth and scored to tie the game at 2. Then in the seventh, he hit a towering fly ball down the right-field line off Brad Penny (5-5) that stayed a few feet fair as it went over the wall.	Chris Ray (3-1) pitched the sixth and seventh innings in relief for Seattle. David Pauley worked the eighth, and Brandon League pitched the ninth for his 18th save.	With two outs and a man on first, pinch-hitter Ramon Santiago lifted a flyball deep to the right-field corner, but it landed foul. He eventually grounded out to end the game.	"Tonight felt like one of those games that you just aren't supposed to win," Detroit manager Jim Leyland said. "We just didn't do much offensively. We've been swinging well, but sometimes you just have to tip your cap to the other guy."	Victor Martinez hit a two-run homer for the Tigers, one of only five hits for Detroit. The Tigers remained a game behind first-place Cleveland in the AL Central.	Seattle starter Erik Bedard allowed two runs and three hits in five innings. He struck out six and walked three before giving way to Ray.	Suzuki was left out of the starting lineup amid a lengthy slump. He's hitting .252 this season and only .149 since May 19.	"He's been playing baseball for a long time," manager Eric Wedge said before the game. "He's mentally tough, he's physically tough. He has so many different things that are reasons for the fact that he has been so successful, but ultimately, he's a human being, and everybody needs a break every now and again."	But the night wasn't that relaxing for Suzuki.	"I was in the cage since the third inning, working out, throwing balls, hitting off the tee, being prepared," Suzuki said through a translator. "From a player's standpoint, you don't want to shut it down. You want to be ready."	Justin Smoak put Seattle ahead with a solo homer in the top of the first, his 11th of the season. Martinez answered in the fourth with an opposite-field shot that gave Detroit a 2-1 lead.	Peguero led off the fifth with a triple and scored on Chris Gimenez's one-out single.	After homering in the seventh to put Seattle ahead, Peguero came up again in the ninth with a man on second and one out, but the Tigers weren't about to give him another chance to hit. They intentionally walked him.	Ray retired six straight Tigers in the sixth and seventh. Pauley took over in the eighth, and pinch-hitter Don Kelly led off with an infield single off his glove. Kelly made it as far as third base before Brennan Boesch struck out swinging at a pitch in the dirt to end the inning.	The four scoreless innings from the bullpen helped the Mariners win for the 17th time in their last 25 games.	"They've done a really good job," Bedard said. "The reason we're in the position we're in right now is because of them. After the starters get out, if they put zeros up there, it puts less pressure on our offense."	Penny pitched seven innings, allowing three runs on eight hits with two strikeouts.	"I made two terrible pitches to Peguero and he killed both of them," Penny said. "I felt fine out there, but I'm never going to be happy when I lose a game."	Game notes	 Detroit has at least one extra-base hit in all 63 games this season. ... Seattle's Chone Figgins, who took over Suzuki's leadoff spot, had two hits. ... Detroit's Ryan Raburn struck out three times. ... Pauley lowered his ERA to 0.96.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

NEW YORK --  Yankees manager Joe Girardi was red in the face with anger, nose-to-nose in a screaming match with Cleveland counterpart Manny Acta after Mark Teixeira was whacked with a fastball.	Tired of getting hit by pitches -- and losing to rival Boston -- the fired-up Yankees took out their frustration on the skidding Cleveland Indians.	Alex Rodriguez hit a colossal home run, Curtis Granderson also connected and New York got back on track with an 11-7 victory Friday night in a game that quickly grew testy.	"Sometimes it doesn't really matter if it's on purpose," Rodriguez said. "There's no question, it was very important for us to bounce back and play our type of baseball."	Girardi and Acta got into a heated argument when both benches and bullpens emptied after Teixeira was hit behind the shoulder by a second-inning pitch from struggling Cleveland starter Fausto Carmona.	No punches were thrown and there appeared to be little pushing and shoving -- if any. Plate umpire Dale Scott issued warnings to both teams, and there was no further trouble.	"I have respect for Manny. I actually had a nice exchange with Manny at 3 o'clock today. But that doesn't mean there's not some feistiness in me and when my guys are getting plunked, I'm going to protect them," said Girardi, who gestured angrily at Carmona on the field. "I told him I thought he did it on purpose and I didn't like it."	Ivan Nova (5-4) pitched seven sharp innings for New York, and Derek Jeter had one hit to move within nine of 3,000. Jorge Posada, breaking out of a season-long slump, added three hits and an RBI on a night when his figurine was handed out to fans.	One of them sat on a ledge near the Yankees dugout as he singled home a run to cap a three-run first. Posada has four straight multihit games, raising his average from .169 to .215.	"Just waiting for the ball longer and hitting it to all fields," he said. "Really seeing it better."	Rebounding from a three-game sweep by the Red Sox, their second at Yankee Stadium in a month, New York sent a wild Carmona (3-8) to his fifth straight loss and finished with 15 hits. The Yankees had dropped 10 of 14 at home.	"Forget who we're playing, you can't have teams be so comfortable against us," Rodriguez said. "I thought tonight was a good way to answer back and answer the call because the last three games at home was very embarrassing for us and it's really not acceptable for us to play that type of baseball."	Robinson Cano had three hits and an RBI, and Teixeira stroked a three-run double that made it 10-2 in the seventh. Rodriguez followed with an RBI double.	In the fourth, the three-time MVP hit his 625th career homer into the second row of bleacher seats in left-center, where an excited fan caught it on the fly. The ball sailed some 450 feet, beyond a loading-bay ramp that sits between Monument Park and the visitors' bullpen.	Yankees staff members could not remember a home run ever reaching that area at the new stadium, which opened in 2009.	"Unfortunately, it only counts for one," Rodriguez said.	Carlos Santana homered for the Indians, barely clinging to first place in the AL Central. Coming off a 1-6 homestand, they have lost 12 of 16 overall.	The opener of a four-game series was the first meeting this season between the teams. It didn't take long for both sides to get heated.	One pitch after Granderson hit his team-high 19th homer into the second deck in right to give New York a 4-0 lead, Carmona threw a pitch that was headed straight for Teixeira's upper back.	Teixeira ducked down and was hit squarely behind the right shoulder as he crumbled to the dirt. The slugger slammed down his helmet, then yelled and gestured at Carmona as he got up.	"It's just disappointing when you have a guy who gives up a long home run and is getting hit around a little bit and decides to throw one close to your head," Teixeira said. "Anytime it's a purpose pitch up near my head, near my neck, I don't like that. ... You want to send a message, just throw the ball low."	Carmona declined to speak with reporters after the game.	The right-hander, who threw 14 of his first 18 pitches for balls and walked three in a 40-pitch first inning, motioned back following Teixeira's response.	"I haven't seen him so divorced from the strike zone as he was today in the two years I've been here," Acta said. "His loading the bases in the first inning did him in."	Girardi was the first Yankee out of the dugout, rushing onto the field to usher Teixeira toward first base and away from a potential fight. Soon the benches and bullpens had emptied as players streamed onto the field.	Both sides milled close together between the mound and first base. Acta moved into the fray and was trying to assure Girardi that Carmona did not hit Teixeira intentionally. But the managers quickly got into a heated, face-to-face argument as an umpire attempted to keep them apart, and Acta could be seen cursing at Girardi on a television replay.	"Normal baseball stuff. Heat of the moment. He's defending his man and I'm defending my guy," Acta said. "My goodness, the guy couldn't throw 50 percent of his pitches for strikes. The other pitches, he just didn't hit anybody, but he couldn't throw strikes. I didn't think there was anything to it."	The banged-up Yankees are feeling a little sensitive these days about inside pitches.	Teixeira left Tuesday night's game against Boston writhing in pain after getting hit on the right kneecap by a first-inning pitch from Jon Lester, and Red Sox ace Josh Beckett plunked three New York stars Thursday night: Jeter, Rodriguez and Granderson.	"It was a great offensive performance. Nova was incredible. But we just took out a little bit of frustration from the last three games tonight and hopefully we can continue to do that," Teixeira said.	Five walks and four hits allowed by inexperienced relievers in New York's injury-depleted bullpen prompted Girardi to bring in Mariano Rivera for the final two outs. He gave up a two-run single to Matt LaPorta, then closed it out.	Game notes	 Indians 2B Orlando Cabrera went 0 for 4 and remains one hit shy of 2,000. He was ejected by Scott for arguing a called third strike in the eighth. ... Granderson is 17 for 39 (.436) with three homers against Carmona.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PHILADELPHIA --  With a seven-run lead, Roy Halladay didn't lobby to stay in the game.	He might push harder next time.	Halladay tossed seven masterful innings to become the first nine-game winner in the majors, Placido Polanco hit a grand slam and the Philadelphia Phillies held on to beat the Chicago Cubs 7-5 on Friday night.	Halladay (9-3) gave up six hits and struck out nine to earn his first win against the Cubs. The Phillies and San Francisco Giants are the only teams he hasn't beaten.	Halladay, who leads the league with four complete games, threw 106 pitches and was ready to go back out in the eighth until Polanco connected to make it 7-0.	"I definitely understand," he said about exiting. "I want to go as far as I can but that makes sense. We have a long way to go and if you can save it, it pays off later."	In his first start since criticizing his team and second-guessing closer Carlos Marmol, Carlos Zambrano got rocked.	Zambrano (5-3) allowed seven runs and seven hits in 6 1/3 innings. He had a season-high seven walks.	"Too many walks," Zambrano said. "You can't do that against teams like this. Next time I will make an adjustment."	Trailing 7-0 in the eighth, the Cubs rallied with five runs off relievers Jose Contreras and J.C. Romero.	But Michael Stutes came in and shut them down, and Antonio Bastardo got the final out for his second save. Ryan Madson was unavailable a night after blowing his first save.	"The silver lining is seeing those young guys," Halladay said of Stutes and Bastardo. "They were put on the spot and did a great job."	Domonic Brown also hit a homer for the NL East-leading Phillies. His two-run shot gave Philadelphia a 3-0 lead in the second. Polanco, batting fifth for the first time this season, increased the lead in the seventh.	"When I'm in the box, I don't think if I'm hitting second or fifth," Polanco said. "I just try to do my job."	Halladay didn't need much, but the bullpen almost blew it. The reigning NL Cy Young Award winner improved to 29-3 when the Phillies give him a lead. He didn't allow a walk for the fourth time in 14 starts.	Aramis Ramirez hit a two-run single off Contreras. Geovany Soto had an RBI single and pinch-hitter Luis Montanez hit a two-run single off Romero to cut it to 7-5.	Stutes entered and struck out pinch-hitter Brad Snyder and retired Kosuke Fukudome on a fly to left to strand two runners.	"I try not to pitch to the situation," Stutes said. "I try to go in and get hitters out and it just happened to be in the middle of a rally for them."	Zambrano started a 3-2, 10-inning loss in St. Louis last Sunday. Marmol gave up a tying RBI double to Ryan Theriot in the ninth, setting up Albert Pujols' second consecutive game-ending homer.	Afterward, Zambrano said: "We're playing like a Triple-A team. This is embarrassing." He also questioned Marmol's pitch selection to Theriot, a former teammate.	Zambrano apologized a day later, saying his comments were made out of frustration. The only person he was frustrated with this time out was himself.	Zambrano angrily snatched the throw back to the mound with his bare hand, walked several feet behind the mound and stared into space while waiting for Brown to circle the bases in the second.	After Polanco went deep with the bases loaded on three walks, including an intentional one to Chase Utley, Zambrano casually caught the new ball with his glove and calmly waited on the mound for manager Mike Quade to come out and pull him.	Zambrano had allowed just three earned runs combined in his previous three starts.	Game notes	 Second-base umpire Alan Porter drew cheers from the crowd before the sixth inning for dancing with the Phillie Phanatic, the furry green mascot who was dressed like Lady Gaga complete with a blonde wig. ... Phillies manager Charlie Manuel flip-flopped Shane Victorino and Polanco in the Nos. 2 and 5 spots in the lineup. It was just the 11th time Polanco batted fifth in his career. ... A crowd of 45,602 was the 170th straight sellout at Citizens Bank Park, including postseason games. ... Cubs second baseman Darwin Barney was 0-for-4 and is hitless in his last 13 at-bats. ... Zambrano's ERA rose from 3.98 to 4.40. ... The Phillies scored more than three runs for only the second time in 10 games.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

PITTSBURGH --  Although rookie Dillon Gee may not be perfect his record still is.	Gee remained undefeated, Jose Reyes homered among his three hits and the New York Mets won for the fifth time in six games, 8-1 over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Friday night.	Gee became the first Mets' rookie starter to improve to 7-0, and New York has won all nine of his starts. He allowed one run and eight hits in a career-high eight innings with no walks and five strikeouts.	"He really pitched great again," Mets manager Terry Collins said before deadpanning, "but we finally figured out a flaw: He can't bunt. We've got to work on that."	Gee bunting into a force play during New York's five-run fourth inning aside, he won his fifth straight outing and is the majors' first rookie starter to open 7-0 since 2006, when Jered Weaver started 9-0 for the Los Angeles Angels.	Gee has allowed one earned run or less in three of his past five starts and has allowed only one run over his past two outings combined.	"I can't say enough good things about the job he's done on that mound, controlling his emotions, keeping himself in the game and just making pitches," Collins said. "He's been really amazing to watch."	Gee also beat the Pirates on May 30 in New York.	"I was hoping we would adjust better this time," Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said. "He's 7-0 now. He got us twice. He's in a good place right now. You're going to have to beat him by stretching at-bats out and we weren't able to do that."	Reyes and Josh Thole went 3 for 5, and Angel Pagan had two hits and scored twice for New York.	The Pirates' Charlie Morton had his worst start of the season -- though he was the victim of some infield hits, shoddy defense and bad bounces. Morton (6-3) lasted a season-low four-plus innings, allowing seven runs (six earned) and nine hits.	"Charlie didn't throw the ball that bad," Pirates second baseman Neil Walker said. "We made a couple of errors to put some runners in scoring position and that made it tougher on him. You just have to mark it down as a bad day for us."	Pittsburgh has lost two straight since reaching .500 in June for the first time since 2005.	Six of the first seven Mets to come to bat in the fourth had hits, including RBI singles by Lucas Duda and Thole and a two-run single by Justin Turner.	Recalled from the minors on Friday, Duda added a sacrifice fly in the fifth.	Reyes, who made his major league debut exactly eight years ago as a 19-year-old, had a 12-game hitting streak snapped on Thursday. He singled twice and hit his second homer, leading off the sixth with a line drive over the 21-foot wall in right.	"I was a little concerned about him (when the streak ended Thursday)," Collins joked. "I told him today I was taking a chance putting him back in there."	The Mets scored an unearned run in the first inning after loading the bases without a hit. Pagan's groundout scored Turner.	Pittsburgh began the bottom of the inning with three consecutive singles. Andrew McCutchen drove in Jose Tabata, but from that point through the seventh, Gee faced only one over the minimum.	It was the second consecutive game in which the Pirates did not have an extra-base hit.	That continued a trend by Gee, who has allowed nine extra-base hits in his nine starts -- and he still hasn't shown his best stuff, he said.	"There's definitely still a lot of work to be done, I feel like," Gee said.	"I don't want to look into (the streak) too much," he added. "I definitely feel like I'm gaining more confidence every time out. But it's hard work here, and I have to keep working to maintain where I'm at and gain a little better, too."	Game notes	 The teams opened their second four-game series against each other over the past 12 days. ... Pirates SS Ronny Cedeno's error in the first inning snapped a 44-game errorless streak. ... Mets OF Jason Bay was given a second consecutive day off as he works to break an 0-for-23 slump. Bay, PNC Park's all-time leader in home runs and RBIs, played for the Pirates from 2003-08. He has yet to play against his former team, but Collins said he will be in the lineup on Saturday.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.

Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.
