OAKLAND, Calif. -- Justin Verlander ripped off his jersey and rubbed Torii Hunter's bald head. The Tigers pulled on goggles and popped bubbly, then waited for their straggling slugger. At last, Miguel Cabrera walked through the door to chants of "Miggy! Miggy! Miggy!"	Detroit's two biggest stars, Verlander and Cabrera, teamed up Thursday night to send the Tigers back to the American League Championship Series with a 3-0 winner-take-all victory over the Oakland Athletics in their division series.	"We won the game; that's all it's about," Cabrera said. "We want to win a World Series, man, that's our goal."	With the season on the line once more in Oakland, Verlander pitched another Game 5 gem by carrying a no-hit bid into the seventh inning. With his body aching, Cabrera contributed all the offense needed in one sweet swing -- a two-run homer -- as the Tigers eliminated the A's again.	"I'm pitching the way I'm supposed to. I worked my butt off all year to try to get consistent and get myself where I needed to be," Verlander said. "I feel like it finally paid off at the end of the year."	Joaquin Benoit retired Seth Smith on a fly ball with two on in the ninth to close out the deciding game of the series. The Tigers became the first team to reach the ALCS in three straight years since the New York Yankees from 1998 to 2001.	Anibal Sanchez will start Game 1 in Boston on Saturday. The Tigers went 4-3 against the Red Sox this year, but they have never faced each other in the postseason.	Detroit staved off elimination at home in Game 4, overcoming a three-run deficit Tuesday. Behind Verlander, the Tigers never trailed in shutting out Oakland in Game 5 for the second straight October.	The big right-hander gave up a clean, two-out single to Yoenis Cespedes in the seventh to end his chance at the third no-hitter in postseason history. The hit hardly fazed him, however.	"We got pretty close there; seven innings is pretty unbelievable," catcher Alex Avila said. "To be honest, I thought we had a chance. He had the stuff for it, he had no-hit stuff."	On a night he allowed only three baserunners, Verlander made it a postseason-record 30 straight scoreless innings against one team since Coco Crisp hit a leadoff home run for the A's in Game 1 last October.	Just 364 days earlier, Verlander tossed a four-hit, 6-0 masterpiece in Game 5 in this very ballpark, a 122-pitch performance for his first career postseason shutout and complete game.	"Obviously it's something that you dream about as a kid. It's a win-or-go-home (game), you visualize when you're 10 years old in your backyard, Game 5, Game 7, gotta win," Verlander said. "It's pretty exciting to have gone out there twice in that scenario and done a good job."	He nearly matched last year's shutout with a spectacular 111-pitch outing in a rematch of his thrilling pitchers' duel with rookie Sonny Gray five days earlier in Game 2.	Aching slugger Cabrera connected in the fourth, a drive into the left-field seats for his first homer since Sept. 17 and just his third extra-base hit in 99 at-bats. That ended a 20-inning scoreless streak by the Tigers at the Coliseum.	Gray danced with danger from the start with stuff not nearly as crisp as just five nights before, when he matched zeros with the 2011 AL MVP and Cy Young Award winner.	This time, Verlander didn't allow a baserunner until Josh Reddick drew a one-out walk in the sixth -- but the no-hit bid remained until Cespedes' single the next inning. The hardest-hit ball was a fly to the center-field warning track by Stephen Vogt in the sixth.	"Everything about it is frustrating. We're a better team than that," Vogt said. "We deserved better. We just didn't get it done."	Verlander struck out 10 in eight innings, giving him 21 K's in these two starts. He has 43 strikeouts in his four playoff outings against Oakland the past two years.	The A's saw their season end at the hands of Detroit for the third time in as many postseasons, including in a four-game sweep in the 2006 ALCS.	Oakland has lost its past six winner-take-all Game 5s and fell to 1-12 in potential clinchers since 2000. The A's struck out 57 times for the most in a best-of-five playoff series.	Verlander earned the nod for the deciding contest after Game 1 winner Max Scherzer pitched in relief in an 8-6, season-saving win in Game 4 in Detroit. Manager Jim Leyland had no qualms turning again to Verlander, who went 13-12 this season.	When asked before the game about his bullpen availability, Leyland nodded his head and quipped, "Verlander, he's available."	Gray, meanwhile, looked overmatched this time. He wiped his brow and never got comfortable. Then, he broke his left thumb on Prince Fielder's fifth-inning comebacker.	A's manager Bob Melvin went with Gray over 18-game winner and 40-year-old Bartolo Colon, who yielded three first-inning runs to lose Game 1.	"He pitched fine tonight," Melvin said. "He basically just gives up a home run to Miguel Cabrera. When you don't score a run and only get a couple hits, you know you have to be perfect."	These Game 5s are becoming awfully familiar for both sides in their recent October rivalry.	Detroit held another clinching party in the visiting clubhouse of the Oakland Coliseum, where a raucous crowd of 46,959 swirled yellow towels until Benoit threw his hands in the air at the final out.	Avila met Benoit in front of the mound for a long embrace as their teammates quickly joined them -- with cheers of "Let's go Oakland!" still ringing out.	The Tigers came together near the mound for a unique chant in which they squatted in unison and raised their hands in the air. They call it "Turn Up," because "you've gotta turn it up," Avila said.	The 93-win Tigers are determined to take the next step and win a championship after being swept in four games of the 2012 World Series by the San Francisco Giants.	"That's the motivation that we've been looking for, that we've had all year," Verlander said. "Guys like Torii who wasn't a part of our team last year, he comes in and he's got that urge. He wants to win that championship before he retires. Everybody else that was here that had a taste of that last year, how much it hurts, it's that extra driving factor."	Hunter hollered for all to hear in the clubhouse, "Let's go, boys! Way to fight!"	The 23-year-old Gray, pitching to chants of "Sonny! Sonny!" in his 12th career start, returned for the sixth inning at 92 pitches but was done once he allowed consecutive singles to Victor Martinez and Jhonny Peralta. Omar Infante then drove in the third run with a fielder's choice grounder off Dan Otero.	Along the 880 freeway just outside the Coliseum, a billboard blared: "IT'S ALWAYS SONNY IN THE TOWN." The only thing sunny was the outfield for the early evening start, which had players shielding their eyes to deal with tricky shadows and sun angles. Center field and right field initially played in bright sun.	Rookie starters have lost their past six winner-take-all postseason games since Daisuke Matsuzaka beat Cleveland in the 2007 ALCS for Boston.	Gray's curveball had less break, and he never found the same groove that carried him in his playoff debut. It was a breezy Bay Area night and 19 degrees cooler at first pitch than the 82 degrees in a game that started an hour later Saturday night.	This marks another disappointing exit for the low-budget A's, who are 27th in payroll size in baseball at $71.1 million after having the smallest payroll at $59.5 million last year.	"Right now, it's a little emotional, a little sad and a little frustrating," Crisp said. "I didn't want to have to say goodbye so soon to the guys I went to battle with. It's hard."	Game Notes	Verlander tried for just the third no-hitter in postseason history and first since Philadelphia's Roy Halladay no-hit Cincinnati on Oct. 6, 2010. Don Larsen pitched a perfect game for the New York Yankees against Brooklyn in the World Series on Oct. 8, 1956. ... Brandon Moss struck out 13 times in 18 at-bats. Detroit's Austin Jackson fanned 13 times in 20 at-bats.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ST. LOUIS -- Carlos Beltran kept protesting that he's just one player.	Albeit a pretty special one in October.	"Understand this is not about me," Beltran said. "In order for a team to win a ballgame, a lot of things need to happen right, the right way. We have to pitch, we have to play defense and we have to come through offensively."	Beltran had the last two covered like a blanket Friday night in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series, giving the St. Louis Cardinals his latest scintillating postseason performance in a 13-inning, 3-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers.	"Carlos, he's a tough out for us," Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said.	Beltran hit a tying, two-run double in the third inning. Then he took charge on defense, calling center fielder Jon Jay off the ball before throwing out a runner at the plate from shallow right field in the 10th to keep it even.	"I felt I was going to have a better angle so I called for the ball about five or six times," Beltran said. "And Jon Jay was able to hear me and leave it up to me."	Well past midnight at Busch Stadium, Beltran singled into the right-field corner with one out against Kenley Jansen in the 13th inning to finish a game that took 4 hours, 47 minutes.	"I tip my hat to Carlos Beltran; he's a pro," Jansen said. "It's my job to get these guys out. I was comfortable with the situation."	Neither team will have much time to exhale before Game 2 on Saturday afternoon, scheduled to start 14 1/2 hours after Daniel Descalso crossed the plate. It features a marquee pitching matchup -- major league ERA leader Clayton Kershaw versus Cardinals rookie Michael Wacha, who has flirted with no-hitters his past two starts.	Beltran has 16 home runs, 12 doubles and 34 RBIs in 40 career postseason games, and is hitting .345. He also has scored 42 runs and stolen 11 bases while with the Astros, Mets and Cardinals.	The eight-time All-Star is hoping this year ends with his first trip to the World Series.	"Just fun to watch him do his thing, whether it's offensively, the big throw he made defensively," Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said.	It was the longest postseason game for the Dodgers since the 1916 World Series, when Babe Ruth pitched all 14 innings to lead the Boston Red Sox past Brooklyn.	This one also tied for the longest series opener in postseason history, according to STATS. Boston and Cleveland played 13 innings in their 1995 American League Division Series, with the Indians winning 5-4.	"You work so hard in the offseason, spring training and regular season to get to this point, and we're fortunate to be here," Beltran said.	"That's a preview. Today was a good game, and that's what it's all about. They didn't want to lose, and we didn't want to lose," he said.	Descalso had a pinch-hit single with one out in the 13th off rookie Chris Withrow, and Matt Carpenter walked. Jansen, usually the Dodgers' closer, relieved, and Beltran won it with his hit on a 3-1 count.	The Cardinals remained unbeaten in extra-inning postseason games since dropping the opener of the 1946 World Series to Boston. That said, they're just 4-0 in that span.	Winning pitcher Lance Lynn strengthened his case for a possible Game 4 start with two scoreless innings. Withrow took the loss.	"There were a lot of big outs that both teams got tonight," Mattingly said. "If the rest of the series is like this game, it should be a pretty good one."	The Dodgers had two on in the ninth, 10th and 11th, and came up empty. They stranded 11 overall while going 1-for-10 with runners in scoring position. They averaged 6 1/2 runs and batted .333, best ever in an NL postseason series, while taking a four-game division series from the Braves.	Dodgers starter Zack Greinke struck out 10 in eight innings, allowing just four hits. Cardinals starter Joe Kelly left after the sixth with the score 2-all.	Mark Ellis tripled with one out in the Dodgers' 10th. After Hanley Ramirez was intentionally walked, Michael Young followed with a fly ball to shallow right field that Beltran caught.	Beltran made a strong, one-hop throw home, and Ellis crashed into Gold Glove catcher Yadier Molina.	Molina held the ball, but it was hard to tell whether he actually tagged Ellis. On such plays, however, umpires almost always give the benefit to the catcher and call the runner out.	"You've got to go, that's what you do," Ellis said. "They made a great throw; Yadi made a great tag."	The Dodgers put runners at first and second with two outs in the 11th against John Axford. Pinch hitter Nick Punto, who played for the Cardinals on their 2011 World Series championship team, struck out to end the inning.	Young, in the game after cleanup man Adrian Gonzalez was pulled for a pinch runner in the eighth, got another chance in 12th. With runners on first and second, he grounded into an inning-ending double play against Lynn.	Beltran's double in the third barely eluded center fielder Andre Ethier.	Slowed by a sore ankle, Ethier made his first start in this postseason. He appeared to mistime his jump just a bit as he banged into the padded wall.	Beltran's two-run double in the third was the only damage against Greinke. He fanned Carpenter, Matt Adams and Pete Kozma twice each, and struck out the side in the fifth.	The teams are postseason foes for the first time since a Dodgers sweep in their 2009 division series. It's their first NLCS matchup since 1985, when the Cardinals won in six games behind game-breaking homers from Ozzie Smith and Jack Clark off Tom Niedenfuer.	Kelly left on his own terms after six innings in a 2-all tie, hurt only by Juan Uribe's two-run single in the third.	Kelly got all three outs on strikeouts in the first. The Dodgers left runners on second and third when Gonzalez and Yasiel Puig fanned.	Kershaw started the division series clincher against Atlanta on three days' rest Monday and will be on regular rest in Game 2. The left-hander said the media made a big deal of short rest, but not he nor Mattingly.	Dodgers hitting coach Mark McGwire got a nice hand when he lined up along the third-base line during introductions. So did two other former Cardinals, utility men Skip Schumaker and Punto. There was some booing for Greinke, who referred to Cardinals ace Chris Carpenter as a "phony" when Greinke was with the Brewers.	Game notes	Carpenter, who entered in a 1-for-29 slump, walked and scored on Beltran's double. ... Greinke's career best is 15 strikeouts, for the Royals on Aug. 25, 2009, against Cleveland. ... It was the longest NLCS game since the New York Mets beat Atlanta 4-3 in 15 innings on Robin Ventura's "grand slam single" in 1999.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

ST. LOUIS -- Matched against ace Clayton Kershaw, the only thing Michael Wacha lacked was a no-hit watch.	"He's becoming a guy a lot of teams wish they drafted," teammate David Freese said. "What he's done is remarkable, especially on this stage."	Wacha stared down a bases-loaded test in the sixth inning and pitched into the seventh, and the kids in the bullpen also were impervious to October pressure, keeping the Los Angeles Dodgers bats silent for the second straight day and winning 1-0 Saturday for a 2-0 lead in the NL Championship Series.	"I'm kind of at a loss for words to describe him," said fellow rookie Kevin Siegrist, who got a big out to end the seventh. "It's kind of ridiculous how well he's done so far."	The Cardinals managed only two hits off Kershaw and the Dodgers, but Jon Jay's sacrifice fly set up by Freese's double and A.J. Ellis' passed ball in the fifth stood up.	The Dodgers' scoreless streak in the NLCS reached 19 innings after they averaged 6½ runs in a four-game division series against Atlanta. Rookie fireballer Trevor Rosenthal struck out the side in the ninth with a heater reaching 101 mph, fanning pinch-hitter Andre Ethier on three pitches to end it.	A day after outlasting Los Angeles 3-2 in 13 innings, the Cardinals moved two wins away from the World Series.	Game 3 is Monday at Dodger Stadium, with Cardinals ace Adam Wainwright facing rookie Hyun-Jin Ryu. The Dodgers have already used their top two starters and have nothing to show for it.	"We don't get too far ahead of ourselves," Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said. "We don't deny also what's happened here the last two days.	"Those were two very good wins, two very tough wins when you face starters like that."	Hanley Ramirez and Ethier were out of the Dodgers' lineup with injuries after starting in the opener. Los Angeles missed a handful of opportunities, going 0 for 6 with runners in scoring position for a two-day total of 1 for 16. Star rookie Yasiel Puig struck out in all four of his at-bats.	"We had our chances," Kershaw said. "We had our chances, for sure. You've got to give a lot of credit to Wacha."	The teams may have been hindered by shadows creeping across Busch Stadium in a late-afternoon start, with lights providing no real help. Both also were no doubt fatigued, which might have shown on the crucial passed ball by Ellis that wound up resulting in an unearned run.	Wacha was nearly untouchable for the third straight start, allowing five hits with eight strikeouts and a walk in 6 2/3 innings.	The 22-year-old right-hander was one out away from a no-hitter in his last start of the regular season, losing it on an infield hit by Washington's Ryan Zimmerman. Wacha ignored a crowd chanting his name in Game 4 of the division series at Pittsburgh, holding the Pirates hitless for 7 1/3 innings to bring the series back home.	In 22 2/3 innings in his last three starts, Wacha has given up two runs on seven hits with 26 strikeouts and five walks.	The 6-6 Wacha struck out Puig and Juan Uribe with the bases loaded to end the sixth. Catcher Yadier Molina helped by making a couple trips to the mound.	"That was a game-changer right there," Molina said. "To get out of that inning was unbelievable."	Kershaw led off with a single, and runners were on second and third after second baseman Matt Carpenter slid in shallow right to glove Carl Crawford's infield hit but threw it away for an error trying to get a forceout at second.	Adrian Gonzalez was walked intentionally to load the bases and the Dodgers 4-5 hitters coming up. Puig struck out on a fastball in the dirt and Uribe had a feeble cut chasing a 1-2 pitch out of the zone.	Carpenter tripled on Kershaw's first pitch of the game but didn't budge when the lefty retired the next three on nine pitches.	The Cardinals had another runner at third with nobody out in the fifth after Freese doubled and advanced on a passed ball by Ellis. This time they converted on Jay's sacrifice fly to shallow left as Crawford's throw was well offline.	The previous pitch the Cardinals tried to squeeze in a run with the Dodgers infield playing in, but Jay fouled off a 1-1 pitch.	Kershaw worked six snappy innings, needing just 72 pitches. He gave up two hits and struck out five.	The majors' ERA leader had plenty left, too, but the Dodgers needed runs and manager Don Mattingly opted for pinch-hitter Michael Young after Nick Punto's two-out single in the seventh.	"I always want to stay in the game, but I understand where Donnie's coming from," Kershaw said. "I get it. We can't give up any more outs and Michael Young is one of the best players the last 10 years."	The Cardinals lifted Wacha for another stingy rookie. Siegrist, who had a minuscule 0.45 ERA in his debut season, threw a pair of wild pitches before getting Young on a flyout to end the seventh.	Relievers Randy Choate and Carlos Martinez pitched the eighth for St. Louis before turning it over to Rosenthal.	The Cardinals handed Kershaw two of his nine losses this season and have beaten him four consecutive times overall.	Game notes	SS Ramirez was a late scratch with sore ribs after getting plunked in the first inning of Game 1. Ethier has been slowed by a sore ankle. ... Carpenter has a hit each of the first two games after entering the NLCS in a 3 for 39 slump. ... Choate, the lone veteran reliever the Cardinals used in Game 2, has gotten two outs on four pitches in two appearances.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BOSTON -- Lose the no-hitter, win the game.	That's a trade Anibal Sanchez and the Detroit Tigers were happy to make to take the lead over the Boston Red Sox in the AL Championship Series.	Sanchez and four relievers came within two outs of the first combined no-hitter in postseason history, striking out 17 to beat Boston 1-0 in the series opener on Saturday night.	"At this point, especially in this series, it's not about throwing a no-hitter," said Sanchez, who was pulled after 116 pitches in six innings. "As soon as you get some zeroes ... it's more important. It's more important than the no-hitter at this point."	Sanchez struck out 12 -- including a record-tying four in the first inning -- but also walked a season-high six. Al Alburquerque, Jose Veras, Drew Smyly and Benoit stretched the no-hitter through eight innings.	With one out in the ninth, Daniel Nava lined a single to center field off Joaquin Benoit to end Detroit's bid for the third postseason no-hitter ever.	"I'm not going to lie to you. I wanted it," Tigers catcher Alex Avila said. "But had to think about the next hitter with a 1-0 game."	Stephen Drew flied out to right and, with the potential tying run on second, Xander Bogaerts hit a game-ending popout to shortstop that put the Tigers ahead in the best-of-seven series. Boston's Clay Buchholz will face major league wins leader Max Scherzer in Game 2 on Sunday night.	Jhonny Peralta had an RBI single off Jon Lester in the sixth for the game's only run. Peralta, who missed most of August and September while serving a 50-game suspension for violating baseball's drug rules, was taunted with chants of "Steroids!" and "User!" as he looped a single to center to bring home Miguel Cabrera.	It was a day for pitching in the playoffs -- St. Louis beat the Dodgers 1-0 in the second game of the NLCS, marking the first time in postseason history two games ended by that score on one day.	"That tells you the quality of pitching in the postseason," Tigers manager Jim Leyland said. "We've got to do a lot better with our opportunities, but in this one we were able to hold on."	The majors' highest-scoring team during the regular season, the Red Sox were shut out at Fenway Park in the postseason for the first time in 95 years.	"You give up one run and you like your chances," said Lester, who allowed six hits and a walk, striking out four in 6 1/3 innings. "It was a great game. That was playoff baseball."	The AL's regular-season ERA champion, Sanchez loaded the bases in the sixth on three walks. But he struck out Drew to end the inning, coming off the mound with a celebratory arm pump and high leg kick.	Alburquerque pitched a perfect seventh, Veras got two outs and Smyly retired David Ortiz on a harmless fly ball to center to end the eighth. Drew kept the score close for Boston in the bottom of the eighth, racing into shallow center field to make a juggling, over-the-shoulder catch on Prince Fielder's looper with runners on second and third.	Benoit struck out Mike Napoli to start the ninth before Nava singled to end the no-hit bid.	"Whether it was Sanchez or every guy they brought out of the bullpen, it was power stuff," Red Sox manager John Farrell said. "To chase a very good starter after six innings, I thought we succeeded in that right. We're down a run. That game is still very much in the balance with every time we come to the plate. ... We achieved what we set out to do and that was to get in the bullpen in the middle innings. And, unfortunately, it didn't work out."	Two nights after Justin Verlander took a no-hit bid into the seventh to finish off Oakland in the AL Division Series, Sanchez had a similar effort against the Red Sox. His four strikeouts in the first inning -- thanks to a third-strike wild pitch to Shane Victorino -- tied the major league record for a postseason game set by the Cubs' Orval Overall in the 1908 World Series.	It's the first time in baseball postseason history a team has had back-to-back games in which its starting pitcher had a no-hitter through five innings.	On a brisk night with the wind blowing in from center, the Tigers got the only run they needed in the sixth after Cabrera drew a one-out walk and moved to second when Fielder was hit by a pitch. Victor Martinez hit a sharp grounder to short for the force at second, but he beat the relay throw to first by inches to keep the inning alive.	Peralta then knocked a 2-2 pitch to center to score Cabrera from third.	Detroit threatened when Martinez doubled to lead off the fifth, but he was caught off second base on Omar Infante's sharp grounder to first. Avila singled, and Infante took third when Victorino bobbled the ball in right.	On Jose Iglesias' grounder, third baseman Will Middlebrooks threw the ball home to retire the lead runner. Austin Jackson flied out to right, ending the inning.	Game notes	Don Larsen threw a perfect game for the New York Yankees against Brooklyn in the 1956 World Series, and Roy Halladay pitched a no-hitter for Philadelphia in the 2010 NL Division Series. ... The Red Sox were shut out for only the second time in 78 postseason games at Fenway Park, the first since losing to the Chicago Cubs 3-0 in Game 5 of the 1918 World Series. ... No Tigers pitcher had ever struck out four batters in an inning before, regular season or postseason. ... Victorino's stolen base in the first gave the Red Sox seven in the postseason, tying a franchise record set in 2004. ... The Red Sox sent Sanchez to the Florida Marlins in the deal that brought Mike Lowell and Josh Beckett to Boston after the 2005 season. He was traded to Detroit last season. ... It was Lester's fourth Game 1 start, surpassing Roger Clemens, Pedro Martinez and Beckett for most in franchise history. ... The 17 strikeouts by Tigers pitchers tied the record for a nine-inning postseason game. It happened twice before. ... It was only Boston's second shutout in 78 postseason home games, according to STATS. The other was in the 1918 World Series, when the Cubs beat them 3-0 in Game 5.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BOSTON -- David Ortiz's line drive sailed just beyond Torii Hunter's reach and into the Boston bullpen, sending the Tigers right fielder flopping headfirst over the wall after it.	With one swing, the Red Sox slugger turned everything upside-down.	Ortiz's grand slam erased an eighth-inning deficit and ended Detroit's unprecedented run of pitching dominance, and Jonny Gomes scampered around the bases with the game-winning run in the ninth Sunday night to give Boston a 6-5 victory over Detroit and knot the AL Championship Series at one game apiece.	"That's what he does. He's an amazing hitter," said Max Scherzer, who took a no-hitter and a 5-0 lead into the sixth inning but could only watch as the Detroit relievers blew it. "He's an amazing postseason hitter. He's clutch. Any given moment, a swing of the bat he can always take you deep."	One night after Anibal Sanchez and four relievers came within two outs of the first combined postseason no-hitter in baseball history, Scherzer struck out 13 and held Boston hitless for 5 2/3 innings. But the Red Sox loaded the bases against three relievers in the eighth and then closer Joaquin Benoit came in to face Ortiz.	The Red Sox designated hitter lined the first pitch into the glove of the Red Sox bullpen catcher. Hunter went down hard and came out only after his teammates had waved for the Detroit medical staff to come out and help him.	"I jumped up. I thought I had a bead on it," said Hunter, who came up in the Minnesota Twins organization with Ortiz and remains friends with the Red Sox slugger. "Next thing, I know I'm falling over the fence."	The fans waited until the trainers verified that Hunter was OK to start chanting, "Papi!" and call Ortiz out of the dugout for a curtain call. It was the first career postseason grand slam for a star of the 2004 playoff run that ended in Boston's first World Series title in 86 years.	"The guy's an actor at work," Red Sox outfielder Shane Victorino said. "It's fun to watch. It's great to see. He's always upbeat and always positive. He always likes to go up and swing the bat. That's what he always wants to do."	Koji Uehara pitched a perfect ninth for the win.	Rick Porcello gave up a leadoff infield single that left Gomes at second when shortstop Jose Iglesias threw the ball into the Boston dugout. Jarrod Saltalamacchia hit a foul popup that glanced off first baseman Prince Fielder's glove when he got tangled up with a fan.	Gomes moved to third on a wild pitch, and then Saltalamacchia hit one through the drawn-in infield to drive in the game-winner.	"It's playoff baseball," Tigers manager Jim Leyland said. "Looked like we had one in hand and we let one get away, there's no question about that. But there have been two great games."	Boston's comeback came a few hours after Tom Brady threw a touchdown pass with 5 seconds left to complete the New England Patriots' comeback over the New Orleans Saints. The score was greeted with cheers by Red Sox fans waiting for the baseball game to start.	Game 3 of the ALCS is in Detroit on Tuesday, when Justin Verlander will face Boston's John Lackey.	"We need it, man. We need start some momentum going on," Ortiz said. "The whole regular season, you haven't seen a team shutting us down for 14, 15 straight innings like they have the past couple of days. If you look at the way they've been pitching, (it's) unbelievable. It's up to us make an adjustment."	Miguel Cabrera and Alex Avila homered off Clay Buchholz as Detroit scored four in the sixth inning to open a 5-0 lead. The Red Sox got one in the bottom half but were four outs from falling behind 0-2 in the series when Ortiz tied it.	Scherzer, who led the majors with 21 wins, did not allow a hit until Victorino singled to left with two outs in the sixth.	It was an unprecedented third consecutive playoff game in which a Tigers starter took a no-hit bid into the sixth inning. That had never been done even twice in a row before this year's Detroit staff, which boasts the AL ERA leader, the major league leader in wins and the 2011 AL Cy Young winner and MVP.	"Scherzer was terrific. He was spent," Leyland said. "Last night our bullpen was flawless, and tonight it just wasn't quite as good."	In his first career ALCS start, Buchholz allowed five runs on eight hits in 5 2/3 innings while striking out six.	One night after Jon Lester absorbed a 1-0 loss, Buchholz kept the Red Sox in the game despite allowing three straight hits in the second and spotting Detroit to a 1-0 lead.	But Cabrera hit a solo shot off the light tower above the Green Monster in the sixth, then Fielder lined a double off the left-field wall. Victor Martinez followed with an RBI double to right-center and Avila hit a two-run shot over the Tigers bullpen to make it 5-0.	Scherzer continued to coast, striking out at least one batter in every inning. The favorite for the AL Cy Young Award after going 21-3 with a 2.90 ERA in the regular season, Scherzer allowed one run on two hits and two walks before leaving after seven innings with a 5-1 lead.	NOTES: Dave Roberts, whose stolen base sparked Boston's comeback in the 2004 ALCS against the New York Yankees, threw out the ceremonial first pitch. ... Ortiz's 63rd postseason game tied Jason Varitek for the Red Sox franchise record. ... Buchholz had a 1.20 ERA against the Tigers in four career starts at Fenway Park. ... Victorino's nine career hit by pitches in the postseason tie him with Alex Rodriguez for the major league record. .. Scherzer lost 2-1 at Fenway Park on Sept. 9 when going for his 20th win.

LOS ANGELES -- Led by a pair of precocious rookies, the Los Angeles Dodgers got themselves right back into the National League Championship Series.	Hyun-Jin Ryu outpitched Adam Wainwright with seven innings of three-hit ball, and Yasiel Puig celebrated twice on his RBI triple that helped Los Angeles beat the St. Louis Cardinals 3-0 on Monday night in Game 3.	Adrian Gonzalez's RBI double ended a 1-for-17 drought for the Dodgers with runners in scoring position. An ailing Hanley Ramirez added a run-scoring hit as Los Angeles handed Wainwright his first postseason loss and trimmed its deficit to 2-1 in the best-of-seven series.	"The playoffs are one-day momentum swings," Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said. "Right now I feel like we've kind of grabbed it."	Puig's youthful exuberance, which energized the Dodgers as they surged from last place to first during a torrid midseason stretch, was on full display in the fourth inning.	The 22-year-old Cuban defector was so excited when he connected that he raised his arms immediately and stood in the batter's box to watch the flight of the ball toward right field, clearly thinking it was going out of the park.	Once he realized it wasn't, Puig started charging. He roared into third base and clapped his hands before raising them again as the sellout crowd of 53,940 cheered.	Puig had reason to exult, having struck out seven times in the series before getting his first hit.	"He brings unbelievable energy every day," Ramirez said. "When we spoke to him, he told me, 'I got it today,' and he did. He's a great player."	Game 4 is Tuesday at Dodger Stadium, with Ricky Nolasco scheduled to start against St. Louis right-hander Lance Lynn.	"Everybody's trying to do the best they can to get to the World Series," Puig said through a translator.	Los Angeles got Ramirez and center fielder Andre Ethier back in the lineup after both proved in batting practice they were healthy enough to play. Ramirez wore a lightweight flak jacket to protect his broken left rib -- having been hit by a pitch from Joe Kelly in Game 1 -- while Ethier has been bothered by shin splints.	"What can I say? It couldn't be better," Ramirez said. "Really happy we got the first win. Just come back tomorrow and even up the series."	Ramirez singled his first time up off Wainwright and then helped the Dodgers extend their lead to 3-0 in the eighth.	Ramirez hit a soft single off Seth Maness over the head of second baseman Kolten Wong to score Carl Crawford. The speedy Crawford, on second base after a one-out single, rounded third and never stopped running when the throw from the outfield went to second base.	On a close play at the plate, Crawford barely beat the tag by catcher Yadier Molina.	"We just had a lot of balls in the air tonight that hit the ground that normally don't," Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said. "We're a better club than this."	During the rally, retired Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda, whose 1988 team won the franchise's last World Series title, stood up and waved his white rally towel to raucous applause.	"We just knew we had to scratch away and get a win," Dodgers catcher A.J. Ellis said. "We needed a great starting pitching performance from Hyun-Jin, and we got that. You knew it was going to be tough sledding against a guy like Adam. He's so good, especially on the big stage, so we were fortunate we scratched a couple of runs across."	Wainwright entered 4-0 with a 2.03 ERA and four saves in 15 career postseason games, including six starts. He pitched St. Louis past Pittsburgh in the division series, going the distance in a decisive Game 5 on Wednesday.	The right-hander tossed seven strong innings this time, allowing two runs and six hits with five strikeouts and no walks. Ryu, however, was even better.	"I hate to lose," Wainwright said. "I felt like tonight if I had got a couple of balls in there, we win the game. I think you just have to tip your hat and move on."	The two pitchers were nearly even through the first three scoreless innings, with Wainwright giving up one hit. Ryu, who struggled in his first postseason start in the division series against Atlanta, retired 12 of his first 13 batters, yielding only a walk.	"I just zoned in," Ryu said.	Ryu was much improved after lasting just three innings as the first South Korean pitcher to start a playoff game last week against the Braves. He allowed four runs on six hits for a no-decision in a game the Dodgers won.	The left-hander didn't permit a Cardinals runner past second base. David Freese's single to right leading off the fifth was their first hit of the game.	Freese was replaced by a pinch runner because of tightness in his right calf. He is day to day.	Ryu struck out four and walked one.	Mattingly went out to the mound accompanied by a translator with two outs in the seventh. Ryu responded by striking out Matt Adams to end the inning as Ellis pumped his right arm in the air. Fans waved South Korean flags in support of Ryu.	"It's definitely a big motivation when you see your star players go out there hurt," Ryu said through a translator. "It really inspires you and motivates you to go out there and do the best you can."	Kenley Jansen pitched a perfect ninth for a save.	Major League Baseball noted on Twitter that the nine combined runs in the series are the fewest ever through three games of a league championship series, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.	After the first two games in St. Louis were decided by one run, the Dodgers got to Wainwright in the fourth and took a 2-0 lead.	Gonzalez's double down the right-field line scored Mark Ellis, who doubled leading off. With two outs, Puig tripled off the wall in right to snap his 0-for-11 skid in the series.	Cardinals center fielder Jon Jay was involved in an apparent miscommunication when the ball hit by Mark Ellis dropped between him and right fielder Carlos Beltran. The Dodgers' first hit, a single by Ramirez to shallow center in the first, dropped between Jay and second baseman Matt Carpenter.	"It's a ball I've got to catch. I'm the center fielder. It's my ball. I've got to take charge," Jay said. "It came back to haunt us, but that's part of baseball. You're going to make mistakes sometimes."	NOTES: In the fourth, the Dodgers snapped a stretch of 22 innings without a run. They hadn't scored since the third inning of Game 1. ... Ethier was 0-for-4 with a strikeout. ... Dusty Baker, Reggie Smith, Ron Cey and Steve Garvey -- baseball's first 30-homer quartet in 1977 -- tossed ceremonial first pitches. That Dodgers team won the NL pennant before losing to the Yankees in six games in the World Series. ... Neither team has a home run through the first three games. ... Among the famous faces in attendance were Dustin Hoffman and Ice Cube.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

DETROIT -- Once again this October, one run was enough.	The Boston Red Sox scored it -- and now they lead an AL Championship Series that seemed to be slipping away last weekend.	John Lackey edged Justin Verlander in the latest duel of these pitching-rich playoffs, and Boston's bullpen shut down Detroit's big boppers with the game on the line to lift the Red Sox over the Tigers 1-0 Tuesday for a 2-1 advantage in the ALCS.	Mike Napoli homered off Verlander in the seventh inning, and Detroit's best chance to rally fell short in the eighth when Miguel Cabrera and Prince Fielder struck out with runners at the corners.	"This game had the feel it was going to be won or lost on one pitch," Boston reliever Craig Breslow said. "Lackey kept us in the game. Every inning where he was able to throw up a zero gave us a lift."	Despite three straight gems by their starters, the Tigers suddenly trail in a best-of-seven series they initially appeared to control. Game 4 is Wednesday night at Comerica Park, with Jake Peavy scheduled to start for the Red Sox against Doug Fister.	Peavy set the tone Tuesday during a pregame news conference, when he sounded miffed that so much of the attention was focused on Verlander before Game 3.	"It's been funny for me to watch all the coverage of the game coming in," Peavy said. "Almost like we didn't have a starter going today. Our starter is pretty good, too."	Lackey backed that up and then some.	He allowed four hits in 6 2/3 innings, striking out eight without a walk in a game that was delayed 17 minutes in the second inning because lights on the stadium towers went out.	"I think that little time off gave him a chance to slow down a little bit. He was excited and pumped that first inning," Boston catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia said. "Kind of getting excited with his slider, throwing a little too hard and leaving it over the middle, but he was still pretty effective."	It was the second 1-0 game in this matchup between the highest-scoring teams in the majors. Dominant pitching has been a running theme throughout these playoffs, which have included four 1-0 scores and seven shutouts in the first 26 games.	"The runs are pretty stingy," Tigers manager Jim Leyland said. "This is what it's about in postseason, is good pitching."	After rallying from a five-run deficit to even the series in Game 2, Boston came away with a win in Detroit against one of the game's best pitchers. The Tigers had a chance for their own comeback in the eighth when Austin Jackson drew a one-out walk and Torii Hunter followed with a single.	But Cabrera, who failed to reach base for the first time in 32 postseason games for the Tigers, never looked comfortable against Junichi Tazawa, swinging and missing at the first two offerings and eventually chasing an outside pitch for strike three.	"To me, I (got) myself out. I was swinging at a lot of balls out of the strike zone," said Cabrera, who has been banged up for a couple of months but homered in Game 2. "When you swing at balls, you're not able to have success."	Fielder looked even more overmatched against Koji Uehara, striking out on three pitches.	Uehara also worked the ninth for a save, ensuring that Lackey's fine performance wouldn't go to waste.	Lackey pitched poorly his first two seasons in Boston after signing an $82.5 million, five-year contract in December 2009. Then he missed all of 2012 following elbow ligament-replacement surgery.	He's been better this season, and he kept the defending AL champions off balance Tuesday by effectively changing speeds.	"He just never gave in," Saltalamacchia said.	Napoli's first at-bat in the majors was against Verlander on May 4, 2006, at Comerica Park. He homered then, too.	"He's tough. He was on his game tonight. He was keeping all of us off balance," said Napoli, who rubbed his bat on teammate Jonny Gomes' beard before going up to the plate. "I got to a 3-2 count and put a good swing on a pitch, was able to drive it."	In the last two games, the Tigers have started Verlander and 21-game winner Max Scherzer -- and the Red Sox won both.	Throw in Anibal Sanchez's outstanding effort in the opener, when the Red Sox managed only a ninth-inning single in a 1-0 loss, and Detroit's three starters in the ALCS have combined to allow two runs and six hits with 35 strikeouts in 21 innings.	Still, the Tigers have fallen behind because their bullpen blew a four-run lead late in Game 2 and the offense came up empty at home on Tuesday.	Detroit stranded runners on first and third in the first, then wasted Jhonny Peralta's leadoff double in the fifth. Peralta reached third with one out, but an overanxious Omar Infante struck out and Andy Dirks grounded out.	Verlander needed every bit of focus after Jacoby Ellsbury's one-out single in the sixth. The Tigers have not held runners well this year, but a number of pickoff throws helped prevent a steal. At one point, Verlander appeared to be pointing at his wrist, as if to ask the dugout if his delivery to the plate was quick enough.	Amid all that, Verlander got Shane Victorino on a flyout, and after Ellsbury moved to second anyway on a wild pitch, Dustin Pedroia grounded out to end the threat.	Napoli's homer was the first run allowed by Verlander since Sept. 18 -- he pitched six scoreless innings in each of his last two starts in the regular season before blanking the opposition for 21 innings in the playoffs.	Lackey was pulled with one on in the seventh. Breslow came on and walked Alex Avila, but Infante's groundout ended the inning.	The Red Sox appeared to be in deep trouble when Detroit led 5-0 in Game 2 at Fenway Park, but David Ortiz tied it with an eighth-inning grand slam off closer Joaquin Benoit, and Boston won it in the ninth.	Verlander looked ready to halt any notion of momentum for the Red Sox. He struck out six straight in the second and third, matching a single-game postseason record.	Lackey did his best to keep pace, retiring 10 in a row before Peralta's double.	The Tigers had taken no-hitters into at least the sixth inning of the previous three games. Verlander fell an out short of extending that streak when Gomes hit a roller up the middle for an infield single in the fifth.	"We won a game with four hits tonight. It says a lot about this team," Gomes said.	NOTES: Detroit reliever Phil Coke struck out seven straight over multiple outings during last year's World Series against San Francisco, according to STATS. ... DTE Energy said the lighting outage was because of a cable failure in the area near the stadium. ... The last time there were four 1-0 games in one postseason was 1991, according to STATS. There were three in the NLCS and another when Minnesota beat Atlanta in Game 7 of the World Series.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

LOS ANGELES -- Thanks to two big swings and some excellent defense, the St. Louis Cardinals are one win from the World Series.	Just like last year.	Matt Holliday and pinch hitter Shane Robinson connected for the first home runs of the National League Championship Series, sending St. Louis past the Los Angeles Dodgers 4-2 on Tuesday night for a 3-1 lead in their best-of-seven playoff.	"We can't get ahead of ourselves," Holliday said.	In a series starved for offense, the Cardinals scored as many runs as they did in the first three games combined, in which the teams totaled nine.	Game 5 is Wednesday afternoon at Dodger Stadium, with the Cardinals looking to clinch their 19th pennant. Zack Greinke is set to start for Los Angeles against Joe Kelly.	Of course, St. Louis had a 3-1 lead in last year's NLCS before dropping three straight to San Francisco, the eventual World Series champion.	"We don't feel this is over by any means," infielder Daniel Descalso said. "You don't want to have that feeling again, losing three games in a row when you're so close to getting there. Just because you're up 3-1, it doesn't mean anything. Nobody's going to roll over for you. We've got to keep pushing and keep grinding."	It was a painful defeat for the Dodgers -- in more ways than one. Star shortstop Hanley Ramirez, playing with a broken left rib, was replaced in the top of the seventh inning after striking out three times.	"It felt worse than yesterday," Ramirez said. "It makes me angry."	Hitless in his previous 22 at-bats at Dodger Stadium, Holliday drove a two-run shot off Ricky Nolasco an estimated 426 feet to left field, capping a three-run third inning that gave the Cardinals a 3-0 lead.	"That's about as good as I can hit one," said Holliday, who was 0-for-13 in the series before connecting.	"I wasn't really doubting my swing at all. I felt actually really good with my at-bats. Sometimes in this game you don't always get the results that you want even if you feel like you're having good at-bats, so I just wanted to stay with it," he said.	Seeking a second World Series title in three years, St. Louis turned three important double plays and picked off a runner at second base in the seventh. Defensive standout Pete Kozma, inserted at shortstop in the sixth, started a difficult double play and darted in to complete the pickoff.	"A great heads-up play by him," Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said. "Then it has to be natural instincts and athleticism by (reliever) Carlos Martinez, and I don't know many guys pull that off. He has such athletic moves. He's quick in everything he does. Then to have the guts to wheel and let it fly like that in a game like we have right now, it's off the charts."	Second baseman Matt Carpenter also keyed St. Louis' sharp work with the gloves, one night after some sloppy play was costly in a 3-0 defeat.	Carpenter had an RBI double in the third that scored Descalso, who hit a leadoff single. Carpenter came around on Holliday's homer after there were none in the first three games for the first time in NLCS history.	Martinez pitched two scoreless innings to help nail down the win for starter Lance Lynn. Trevor Rosenthal got three outs for his second save in the series.	After a leadoff single by Andre Ethier in the ninth, Yasiel Puig grounded into a double play. Juan Uribe struck out to end it, leaving the Dodgers on the brink of elimination.	Now, they'll count on Greinke and ace Clayton Kershaw to pitch them back into the series.	"Kind of the best thought I have is, I've got one of the best pitchers in baseball pitching tomorrow," Mattingly said. "If we come out here and play well tomorrow and get a win, I've probably got the best pitcher in baseball pitching the next day."	Robinson's home run bounced off the top of the wall in left field on a 1-0 pitch from J.P. Howell with one out in the seventh, extending the Cardinals' lead to 4-2.	"For a little guy, he's got surprising power," Holliday said. "I mean, honestly, he's got some thump."	Lynn allowed two runs and six hits in 5 1/3 innings. He struck out five and walked three.	The right-hander lost his only other start this postseason, giving up five runs over 4 1/3 innings in Game 2 of the division series against Pittsburgh.	The Dodgers were down 4-2 in the seventh when Nick Punto doubled with one out. Martinez, however, picked off Punto before throwing another pitch and then retired Carl Crawford on an inning-ending groundout.	"It was a lonely place to be," Punto said.	Trailing 3-2, the Dodgers put the potential tying run on base in the sixth when Puig singled to chase Lynn. Uribe grounded into a double play against Seth Maness to end the inning.	The Dodgers stuck with Nolasco as their starter even though he hadn't pitched since Sept. 29. He struggled in his last three starts in September, giving up at least five earned runs in each.	Nolasco was passed over for his scheduled assignment in Game 4 of the division series, when the Dodgers used Kershaw on three days' rest for the first time in his career. Kershaw pitched well and took a no-decision in a 4-3 victory over Atlanta that clinched the series.	Before this one, Mattingly had said Nolasco was being put in a difficult position after not pitching for so long. Mattingly said Kershaw and Greinke both offered to start on short rest at Dodger Stadium.	Nolasco allowed three runs and three hits in four innings. He struck out four and walked one.	"I felt my stuff was good for the most part," he said. "Just that one pitch was the difference in the game."	Los Angeles scored twice in the fourth to cut it to 3-2. Adrian Gonzalez hit a leadoff double and scored on Puig's single. A.J. Ellis singled to drive in Ethier, who walked.	But just when it appeared the Dodgers had grabbed the momentum, pinch hitter Skip Schumaker bounced into an inning-ending double play.	Game notes	Cardinals 3B David Freese came out after six innings for defense. He left Monday's game with a cramp in his right calf, but Matheny said Freese was fine. ... St. Louis won a Game 4 on the road for the first time in NLCS play. ... The Cardinals also squandered a 3-1 lead in the 1996 NLCS against Atlanta. ... Nolasco, who is from nearby Corona and grew up a Dodgers fan, made the first postseason start of his career. ... Schumaker was 3-for-21 with no RBIs as a pinch hitter during the regular season and struck out in his only other at-bat as a pinch hitter in the postseason. ... There was a pregame moment of silence for MLB umpire Wally Bell, who died Monday at 48. ... Tuesday marked the 25th anniversary of Kirk Gibson's famous pinch-hit home run in the bottom of the ninth at Dodger Stadium, giving Los Angeles a 5-4 win over Oakland in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series. ... Hall of Fame manager Tom Lasorda, who at 86 is special adviser to the team chairman, tossed out a first pitch from midway between the mound and home plate that missed the target. Mattingly, who was catching, gave him a mulligan. Lasorda managed that 1988 team, the Dodgers' last appearance in the World Series. ... With the government partially shut down, there was a pregame flyover of vintage aircraft by a nonprofit organization founded by a group of World War II fighter pilots. ... Among the famous faces in the crowd were Tom Cruise and Bryan Cranston of "Breaking Bad."	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

LOS ANGELES -- It took the Dodgers five games to hit a home run in the NL Championship Series. Once Adrian Gonzalez powered up for the first one, their dormant offense broke loose.	Gonzalez homered twice and Zack Greinke came through with the clutch performance Los Angeles needed in a 6-4 victory against the Cardinals on Wednesday that trimmed St. Louis' lead to 3-2 in the best-of-seven playoff.	"Guys weren't ready to lose today," said Carl Crawford, who also went deep to help the Dodgers save their season.	The series shifts back to St. Louis for Game 6 on Friday night, with ace Clayton Kershaw scheduled to start for Los Angeles against rookie Michael Wacha.	When those two squared off in Game 2, the Cardinals won 1-0 on an unearned run.	"We've kind of become America's team because everyone wants to see a seventh game," Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said. "Probably even the fans in St. Louis would like to see a seventh game, so I figure that everybody's for us to win on Friday night."	The Cardinals also led last year's NLCS 3-1 before losing three straight games to the eventual World Series champion San Francisco Giants.	"We're looking to do the same thing," Gonzalez said.	Desperate to avoid elimination, the Dodgers brought in some Hollywood star power for pregame introductions. Will Ferrell announced their lineup and lent a comic spin to each player's name, capping it by introducing Greinke as "today's winning pitcher."	Ferrell knew what he was talking about.	Greinke got into a bases-loaded jam with none out in the first inning but escaped with no damage. From there, he pitched seven strong innings and even delivered an RBI single.	"That was big. I was real nervous out there with that situation," Greinke said.	A.J. Ellis also homered at Dodger Stadium, where it is tougher to clear the fences in the heavy night air.	Helped by playing in 82-degree heat on a sunny afternoon, the Dodgers rediscovered their power stroke just in time to extend the series. They held on in the ninth inning, when St. Louis scored twice off closer Kenley Jansen before he struck out pinch-hitter Adron Chambers with two on to end it.	"It was just one of those days that we were a little better, got some runs, good feeling," Mattingly said.	The Dodgers rallied in this one after Greinke gave up an early 2-0 lead just as he did in Game 1, which Los Angeles lost 3-2 in 13 innings on the road.	After neither team homered in the first three games for the first time in NLCS history, the big bats came out. The Cardinals used a two-run homer by Matt Holliday and a solo shot from pinch-hitter Shane Robinson to win 4-2 on Tuesday night.	This time, Gonzalez went 3-for-4 with two solo homers and three runs scored. His two-out shot in the eighth made it 6-2.	The Cardinals tied it at 2 in the third on Carlos Beltran's RBI triple and Holliday's run-scoring double before Yadier Molina grounded into his second inning-ending double play against Greinke.	"He wasn't as sharp as he was the first time we faced him," Beltran said. "But guys like that, the best guys in the game, they're able to regroup and find a way to help their team win."	Los Angeles answered in the bottom of the third. Mark Ellis singled leading off but was erased when Hanley Ramirez grounded into a double play.	Gonzalez followed with the Dodgers' first homer of the NLCS, slugging the ball an estimated 428 feet into the right-field pavilion for a 3-2 lead.	As he headed toward the dugout, Gonzalez cupped his hands to his ears and wiggled them in a gesture resembling mouse ears. It was an apparent jab at Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright, who said Gonzalez had done "some Mickey Mouse stuff" in celebrating a double on Monday night.	"It's just having fun," Gonzalez said. "I'm going to retire them so they're not talked about once again."	Crawford egged Gonzalez on, telling him he has to keep the ears going.	"I'm pretty sure it rubbed them the wrong way and they're going to use that as some kind of fuel, so you might as well keep doing it," Crawford said, laughing.	Gonzalez replied: "Hey, if Carl wants them. It's for him, not for anybody else."	After wriggling out of big trouble in the first when Molina bounced into a double play, Greinke allowed two runs and six hits. He struck out four and walked one.	"He made his pitches, we made the plays, got out of it," Gonzalez said. "We were able to get run support for him. All he needed was a few runs."	Jansen gave up RBI singles to Matt Adams and Pete Kozma in the ninth.	Ellis homered in the seventh, sending an 0-2 pitch from Edward Mujica into the left-field pavilion to make it 5-2.	Crawford homered with one out in the fifth, extending the Dodgers' lead to 4-2. He walloped a 3-2 pitch from starter Joe Kelly an estimated 447 feet into the right-field pavilion.	Kelly gave up four runs and seven hits in five innings, struck out three and walked none.	Beltran's triple went over the head of Andre Ethier and to the wall in center, scoring Matt Carpenter, who singled. Holliday followed with a double to deep center, but that was it for St. Louis until the ninth.	"We had a couple of opportunities to do something, and we just couldn't make it happen," manager Mike Matheny said. "These guys have done a tremendous job in those exact same situations all season long. You're going to have games where you just can't make it happen, and we've got to figure out a way to get it done the next time we get a chance."	Game notes	Ramirez, playing with a broken left rib, left after six innings. ... In the three games Ramirez has started with the injury, only two grounders have been hit to him at shortstop. ... The homers by Gonzalez and Crawford were the first given up by Kelly in 24 career postseason innings. He allowed two homers in a game twice during the regular season. ... The Dodgers are trying to become the 12th team to rally from a 3-1 deficit to win a best-of-seven series. ... Beltran's triple was his first ever in the postseason. ... Former Dodgers star Orel Hershiser tossed out the first pitch on the 25th anniversary of his three-hit shutout against Oakland in Game 2 of the 1988 World Series.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

DETROIT -- Jim Leyland dropped Austin Jackson to eighth in the batting order, hoping to relax the slumping Detroit outfielder.	So naturally, Jackson's first plate appearance came with the bases loaded. After drawing a four-pitch walk to force in a run, he finally felt a little more at ease.	A revitalized Jackson delivered in Leyland's revamped lineup as the Tigers built a big lead and held on this time, beating the Boston Red Sox 7-3 on Wednesday night to even the American League Championship Series at 2-all. Detroit scored five runs in the second inning, the first coming home on Jackson's walk.	"It was a big situation right there to try to get something done," Jackson said. "I think after I'd seen a couple of pitches I was able to kind of just take some deep breaths and relax a little bit -- and not worry so much about the result, just try to get a good pitch."	Jackson finished with two singles and two walks. He was 3-for-33 with 18 strikeouts in this postseason before Wednesday.	Torii Hunter had a two-run double and Miguel Cabrera drove in two runs after Leyland moved the slumping Jackson out of the leadoff spot and bumped almost everyone else up a place following the Tigers' 1-0 loss in Game 3. The Detroit manager was quick to deflect credit afterward.	"This has nothing to do with Jim Leyland; this is about the players," Leyland said. "They executed, they came out, they played well."	Jackson's bases-loaded walk off Jake Peavy in the second seemed to be a relief for most of Comerica Park. Another strikeout could have derailed the rally, but instead the Tigers broke the game open.	Doug Fister, meanwhile, provided another fine outing for Detroit. He allowed a run in six innings, and the Tigers' starting pitchers have yielded only three runs in 27 ALCS innings -- and struck out 42.	After blowing a 5-0 lead in Game 2, Detroit kept the Red Sox at bay Wednesday.	Game 5 is Thursday night in Detroit. The Tigers' Anibal Sanchez faces Boston's Jon Lester in a rematch of Game 1, which Detroit won 1-0.	Jacoby Ellsbury had four hits for the Red Sox on Wednesday, finishing a homer shy of the cycle, but now it's Boston manager John Farrell fielding questions about whether a lineup shakeup is in order after another tough night against Detroit's pitching.	"The one thing that we've maintained is a constant approach with the lineup and not creating further uncertainty," Farrell said. "I think our guys have responded well to that."	The Tigers lost Games 2 and 3, wasting gems by Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander. Leyland left Jackson in the lineup but changed the batting order. Jackson hit eighth, and with others moving up a spot, it made for an odd-looking lineup. Hunter hit leadoff for the first time since 1999, and Cabrera was second for only the third time in his career -- first since 2004.	"That was pretty good. He switched things up, kind of shake it up a little bit," Hunter said. "It gave us a different mindset. Miggy hitting second, me leading off. It gave us a different mindset to make things happen."	Leyland indicated his batting order would remain the same in Game 5 -- but will he be doing anything special with the lineup card from Wednesday's game?	"I'll throw it away, unless I can sell it to some bar on the way home," he said.	Jackson found himself batting in a crucial situation right away in the second. Peavy walked him to force home the game's first run.	The Red Sox had a chance to halt that rally when Jose Iglesias hit a potential double-play grounder to second, but Dustin Pedroia couldn't field it cleanly and Boston had to settle for a forceout at second that brought home another run.	"That was my fault. We've got to turn that double play," Pedroia said. "That ball was smoked. If I catch it, we're getting two."	Hunter followed with a double down the line in left to make it 4-0, and Cabrera added an RBI single.	After walking three batters in the second inning, Peavy was in trouble again in the fourth. After a leadoff double by Omar Infante, Jackson slapped a single past a diving Pedroia to bring home a run.	"It felt good to contribute to a win," Jackson said. "Just get a chance to go out there and not put so much pressure on yourself, just have fun."	Cabrera's single made it 7-0, and the Detroit third baseman -- who has been running even slower than usual over the past month or so because of groin problems -- caught reliever Brandon Workman and the Boston defense napping when he stole second without a throw.	In the fifth, Cabrera looked healthy enough when he charged Pedroia's slow grounder, barehanded it and threw to first for the out.	Peavy allowed seven runs and five hits in three-plus innings.	Detroit blew a 5-0 lead in Game 2 -- with the bullpen responsible for most of the damage -- and Cabrera and Prince Fielder both struck out with runners at the corners in the eighth inning of Game 3. The tension was building in Motown, but the defending AL champions jumped out to an early lead Wednesday.	David Ortiz's tying grand slam in Game 2 off Detroit closer Joaquin Benoit kept the Tigers from sweeping the first two games at Fenway Park.	Detroit went to Benoit in the ninth Wednesday with a 7-2 lead, and Ellsbury hit an RBI triple with none out. But Benoit struck out Shane Victorino, ensuring that Ortiz wouldn't be able to bat as the tying run later in the inning.	When Ortiz did come up for his rematch with Benoit, there was only one man on. The Boston designated hitter took another mighty swing, but his high fly to right was caught easily.	Detroit had taken a no-hitter into the fifth inning of its previous four games. Pedroia's single in the first put an end to that streak, but the Red Sox didn't do much against Fister.	Boston had a chance to score first in the second. Mike Napoli, whose homer accounted for the only run of Game 3, led off with a double off the tip of Cabrera's glove and went to third on a groundout. Cabrera caught Jarrod Saltalamacchia's foul popup against the railing of the Detroit dugout, and Fister struck out Stephen Drew.	After the Tigers scored five in the second, Boston put two on for Ortiz in the third. He pulled a grounder into Detroit's shifted defense for the third out.	Saltalamacchia hit an RBI single in the sixth, but Fister got out of a two-on, one-out situation after that. The right-hander allowed eight hits and a walk, striking out seven.	Victorino hit an RBI double in the seventh to make it 7-2.	Game notes	The Boston bullpen, which has been outstanding in this postseason, worked five scoreless innings. ...

DETROIT -- Mike Napoli's drive cleared the wall in center field and landed in the ivy -- a spot at Comerica Park usually reserved for Miguel Cabrera's prodigious homers.	In this series, Napoli has been the one hitting key home runs, while Cabrera remains stymied by a tough Boston bullpen.	Napoli opened the scoring with another big long ball, Junichi Tazawa again bested Cabrera in a crucial spot and the Red Sox moved within one win of reaching the World Series by edging the Detroit Tigers 4-3 on Thursday night.	Boston returns to Fenway Park with a 3-2 lead in the American League Championship Series. The Red Sox can win the AL pennant Saturday, when the Tigers' Max Scherzer faces the Red Sox's Clay Buchholz in Game 6.	"Our guys are well aware of where we are," Boston manager John Farrell said. "But at the same time, the beauty of them is to not get ahead of themselves, and that will be the case once that first pitch is thrown on Saturday."	Cabrera was thrown out at the plate in the first inning, halting an early Detroit rally, and he hit into a double play against Tazawa with runners at the corners in the seventh. The Tigers scored a run on the grounder, but it was a trade-off the Red Sox were willing to make.	Napoli opened a three-run second with his homer off Anibal Sanchez. Detroit's starters had allowed only three runs in 27 innings through the first four games of the series. After pitching six no-hit innings in Game 1, Sanchez allowed four hits -- three earned -- in six innings Thursday.	"It seemed like he was living on the corners and got us to chase some pitches the first game," Napoli said. "Me personally, I was just trying to get something up in the zone and see pitches like I always do, and I was able to get something up."	Jon Lester allowed two runs and seven hits in 5 1/3 innings. He walked three and struck out three, and the Boston bullpen held on to finish off the fourth game of the series to be decided by one run.	"There's probably a reason I don't have any hair," Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia said. "It's stressful."	Down 4-2 in the seventh, the Tigers put runners on first and third with nobody out when Jose Iglesias and Torii Hunter singled. Cabrera, who struck out with runners at the corners against Tazawa in the eighth inning of a 1-0 loss in Game 3, hit a soft grounder to second for a double play this time.	"We have to go to Fenway and we have to fight hard enough to win a game," Cabrera said. "If we do that, we have to keep fighting and get the next one. We've done this before, and we've got great pitchers. We just have to do our jobs."	Craig Breslow retired slumping Prince Fielder to end the seventh and got the first out of the eighth. Then Koji Uehara retired five straight for the save.	Now Detroit turns to Scherzer, a 21-game winner, to try to extend the season. The Tigers will have Justin Verlander ready to pitch Game 7 if there is one.	Detroit might be without catcher Alex Avila in Boston. He left after the top of the fourth with a strained left knee and is day to day.	Boston led in only four of 36 innings in the first four games, but the Red Sox won two of them. They struck early in Game 5 when Napoli's drive easily cleared the 420-foot marker in center and landed in the ivy above two rows of bushes. That was the start of a three-run second inning, and it was Napoli's second homer of the series. His solo shot accounted for the only run of Game 3.	Napoli wasn't all that concerned with where the ball went, as long as it cleared the wall.	"It can go in the first row for all I care," he said.	Detroit revamped its lineup before its Game 4 win -- dropping Austin Jackson from the leadoff spot to eighth and moving almost everyone else up a place. The Tigers went with that same general framework Thursday, but it was Farrell's adjustments that paid off.	After Napoli's homer, Jonny Gomes -- starting in left field instead of Daniel Nava -- reached on an error by Cabrera at third base. One out later, 21-year-old Xander Bogaerts -- who started at third instead of Will Middlebrooks -- hit a double.	David Ross, catching in place of Jarrod Saltalamacchia, doubled with men on second and third. Only one run scored on the play because Bogaerts didn't get a good jump from second, but he came home anyway when Sanchez couldn't handle Jacoby Ellsbury's line drive back to the mound. It went off Sanchez's glove for an infield single and a 3-0 lead.	Boston missed out on another run that inning when Ross was thrown out at home on Shane Victorino's grounder. Ross plowed through Avila at the plate -- then gave Avila a pat on the backside after he held on to the ball.	Ross and Avila both have dealt with concussion problems this year, and Avila was later hit in the mask by a foul ball.	In the third, Iglesias gave the Detroit fans something to cheer about with a terrific catch on a shallow fly ball by David Ortiz. Iglesias, who plays shortstop but was shifted over to the right of second base, ran all the way out to short left field, finally catching the ball with a quick snatch of his glove hand.	But Napoli followed with a double, went to third on a groundout and scored on a two-out, two-strike wild pitch by Sanchez to make it 4-0.	Sanchez allowed nine hits and struck out five.	Lester worked in and out of trouble. He was helped in the first inning when Cabrera was thrown out at home for the third out. Cabrera has been slowed by a number of injuries over the past couple of months, and when Jhonny Peralta singled to left, it appeared the Tigers would have the bases loaded with two outs and Omar Infante batting.	But coach Tom Brookens started waiving Cabrera around third, and when Brookens changed course and put up the stop sign, the Detroit slugger ran through it and was out at home on a play that wasn't close.	"Tommy was waving," Leyland said. "In defense of him, the natural instinct is to wave right away -- you don't want to stop him really too quick in case something would happen in the outfield with the ball, the guy would boot it or something. It's hard to get him going again. He just held him too late. With Cabrera right now, you've got to be cautious."	The Tigers had two on and one out in the fourth when Brayan Pena pinch hit for the injured Avila. Pena hit a grounder to the pitcher, and the Red Sox turned a double play with a nifty catch-and-relay at second by shortstop Stephen Drew.	Cabrera managed an RBI single in the fifth. With two on and one out in the sixth, the Red Sox pulled Lester, bringing in Tazawa. Pena immediately singled home a run, but Jackson hit into an inning-ending double play.	Game notes	At 21 years, 16 days old, Bogaerts became the youngest Red Sox player to start a postseason game. The previous record holder was Babe Ruth, who was the starting pitcher at 21 years and 246 days old in Game 2 of the 1916 World Series. ... Thursday's game was played under a misty rain at times but was never delayed. ... There was an odd play in the Boston ninth when Middlebrooks, in the game as a pinch runner, went from first to third on a sacrifice bunt by Ross. Cabrera came charging in to field the bunt, and Pena was slow to get to third and cover the base. Pena caught Fielder's throw, and when he spun to attempt a tag, he first made contact with umpire Rob Drake, who was very close to the bag.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ST. LOUIS -- With the red-clad crowd roaring more loudly with every pitch, Matt Carpenter became more determined to get a hit and help lead the St. Louis Cardinals back to the World Series.	On Clayton Kershaw's 11th offering, Carpenter lined a double to right field. It turned out to be the start of something really big.	Carlos Beltran followed with another key hit in a four-run third inning that stunned the Dodgers ace, Michael Wacha was again magnificent on the mound and St. Louis advanced to its second World Series in three seasons by roughing up Los Angeles 9-0 in Game 6 of the National League Championship Series on Friday night.	"I'm so happy right now. We did it as a team," Beltran said. "We fought hard, we worked hard all season long and thank God we're here."	Wacha, 22, was selected MVP of the NLCS after throwing 13 2/3 scoreless innings and beating Kershaw twice in the series. The first rookie to win the award since Livan Hernandez in 1997 for the Marlins pitched seven innings of two-hit ball Friday.	"We want to see it a few more times, a couple at least," manager Mike Matheny said.	With four runs in the third and five more in the fifth, the Cardinals quickly removed all the tension surrounding a team that squandered a 3-1 series lead in the NLCS last fall against San Francisco.	Game 1 of the World Series is Wednesday at the winner of the American League Championship Series between the Boston Red Sox and Detroit Tigers. The Cardinals won their 19th NL pennant and will be trying for their third World Series title since 2006, having last won in 2011.	The glamorous Dodgers, with the second-highest payroll in baseball at $220 million, failed to reach the World Series for the first time since they won it all in 1988.	"Going through spring, the long season and then it just comes to a crash," Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said. "So, it's disappointing for all of us."	After losing Game 5 in Los Angeles, the Cardinals turned to the 22-year-old Wacha once again. The right-hander was even better in outpitching Kershaw for the second time this series.	It was 52 degrees at game time, a 23-degree drop from the Kershaw-Wacha matchup in Game 2 six days earlier, and Kershaw never got warmed up.	The lefty wasn't in the mood to talk about a season in which he had a majors-best 1.83 ERA, either.	"If you don't win, what's the point?" Kershaw said. "It doesn't really matter. All this stuff."	The top NL CY Young Award candidate was knocked out of a start without finishing the fifth inning for the first time this season.	"I think the first time we faced him he was very tough," Beltran said. "This time he was a little off, but that doesn't mean anything."	Beltran, 36, had three hits, drove in two runs and made a spectacular catch in right field, helping him advance to the World Series for the first time in his 16-year career.	Perhaps showing the Cardinals weren't stressed by the possibility of a second straight postseason meltdown, Games 1 and 5 starter Joe Kelly had a post-national anthem staredown against Dodgers reserve outfielder Scott Van Slyke that was broken up by fed-up plate umpire Greg Gibson after several minutes.	Kelly blinked first then, but when it counted, St. Louis wouldn't budge.	"It was just something fun to start the game off," Van Slyke said. "I don't think I've ever talked to Joe."	Beltran followed Carpenter's gritty double with an RBI single for a 1-0 lead.	Mattingly thought Carpenter's grinding at-bat was the key.	"From there," Mattingly said, "it just seemed like the floodgates opened. ... Took a lot out of him."	With two outs, Yadier Molina added an RBI single. Shane Robinson drove in two runs with a single in his first career postseason start after replacing slumping Jon Jay -- and advanced to second base on Dodgers rookie Yasiel Puig's first of two errors in the Cardinals' big innings.	The Cuban defector, who stood in the outfield during the eighth inning with his arms crossed, also struck out twice and was booed heartily. Hanley Ramirez, a last-minute addition to the Dodgers' lineup, went 0-for-3 while playing with a broken rib.	Kershaw needed 48 pitches to get out of the third, the most pitches of his career. He took exception with one pitch in particular, complaining to Gibson after Matt Adams' full-count walk loaded the bases.	The Dodgers' bench also was vocal after the call on a pitch that might have been an inch or two low of the strike zone.	The Cardinals knocked Kershaw out in the five-run fifth.	Molina and David Freese led off with singles, and Adams followed with a double to chase Kershaw. Wacha drove in a run with a fielder's choice grounder, and Carpenter had a sacrifice fly. Beltran capped the inning with an RBI single -- his 37th postseason RBI in 45 career games.	Wacha has a minuscule 0.43 ERA in three postseason starts, one of the gems coming in Game 4 of the division series to keep the Cardinals alive. In his last regular-season start and with the NL Central up for grabs, he no-hit the Nationals for 8 2/3 innings.	Beltran was the star of the Cardinals' 3-2, 13-inning Game 1 victory, driving in all three runs plus making a perfect throw to keep it tied in extra innings.	Kershaw was charged with seven runs on 10 hits in four-plus innings Friday. The lefty led the majors in ERA the past three years but has lost five straight starts against St. Louis.	None of his outings this year was shorter than five innings, and the most runs he allowed was five, on two occasions. The four-run fourth was his worst inning since July 24, 2012, at St. Louis, when Kershaw yielded eight runs in 5 2/3 innings -- six in the sixth.	"He's the best pitcher in baseball. He's a real tough at-bat," Carpenter said. "He got ahead of me like he almost always does. I struck out my first at-bat. And honestly, when he got two strikes on me the second at-bat, my mindset immediately changed. I'm not striking out."	The Dodgers didn't have much of a chance again Wacha.	Carl Crawford led off the game with an infield hit but was erased on Mark Ellis' double-play ball. A.J. Ellis doubled to start the sixth and didn't advance.	Game notes	Cardinals Hall of Fame SS Ozzie Smith threw the first pitch. ... Beltran has a .331 career postseason average. ... Ramirez batted .133 (2-for-15) in the NLCS with a pair of singles and one RBI.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

BOSTON -- When Shane Victorino signed with the Boston Red Sox as a free agent in the offseason, they were coming off a last-place finish that was their worst in almost half a century. They had fired their manager for the second year in a row.	He believed they could turn it around.	And quickly.	Victorino brought the Red Sox one big step closer to completing their comeback, sending them to the World Series with a seventh-inning grand slam that gave Boston a 5-2 victory over the Detroit Tigers in Game 6 of the AL Championship Series on Saturday night.	The Red Sox will open the World Series on Wednesday night against the St. Louis Cardinals, the team they swept in 2004 to end their 86-year title drought. The Cardinals won the NL pennant on Friday night by eliminating the Los Angeles Dodgers in six games.	"It's one of those moments you live for," Victorino said as he wandered around the Fenway Park infield while Red Sox fans serenaded him with his theme song, Bob Marley's "Three Little Birds," and its chorus, "Don't worry about a thing, 'Cause every little thing is gonna be all right."	"Just listen to the crowd," Victorino said, referring then to the Boston Marathon bombings that left the city reeling during the first month of his first season in town. "The one thing I came here to do is to be a part of this city. With all we went through as a city, there's definitely a bond."	Detroit took a 2-1 lead in the sixth and 21-game winner Max Scherzer protected it until the seventh, when Boston loaded the bases on a double, a walk and an error by rookie shortstop Jose Iglesias. Victorino fell behind Jose Veras 0-2 but lofted a hanging curveball over the Green Monster to set off a celebration in the Red Sox dugout and in the Fenway Park stands.	"It's been a special ride," second baseman Dustin Pedroia said, "and we're still going."	Junichi Tazawa got one out for the win, Craig Breslow pitched a scoreless eighth and series MVP Koji Uehara got the last three outs before the Red Sox poured out of the dugout to begin their now-familiar celebration on the mound.	"The way I would sum it up is that I thought their starters were good," Tigers manager Jim Leyland said. "I thought their bullpen was great."	Uehara, who inherited the closer job after the team's first two choices were injured, posted three saves and a win in the series. Then he joked about pitching so well under pressure.	"To tell you the truth, I almost threw up," Uehara kidded through a translator.	It's the 13th AL pennant for the Red Sox and their first since 2007, when they swept the Colorado Rockies to win it all for the second time in four seasons. Boston swept the Cardinals in '04, winning Game 4 in St. Louis to clinch the title that put an end to generations of disappointment.	The latest trip comes one year after a 69-win season that prompted the team to jettison its high-priced stars, rebuild the roster and bring in manager John Farrell. Victorino was one of the biggest additions, and he delivered on Saturday as he did for much of the season.	"Since the first day of spring training there wasn't one person more important than the next," said outfielder Jonny Gomes, also a newcomer this season. "We're all pulling in the same direction."	Scherzer got one out in the seventh but left after walking rookie Xander Bogaerts to put runners on first and second. Drew Smyly got Jacoby Ellsbury to hit a grounder up the middle, but it popped out of Iglesias' glove behind second base and everyone was safe.	Veras came in and quickly got ahead of Victorino. But he hung a curveball and Victorino sent it toward the 37-foot left-field wall, which had already knocked down two Red Sox line drives.	This one left no doubt.	It was the second career postseason grand slam for Victorino, who also had a record-setting hit-by-pitch in the sixth.	Scherzer and Clay Buchholz also matched up in Game 2, when the Tigers right-hander took a no-hitter and a 5-0 lead into the sixth. The Red Sox rallied against the Detroit bullpen, tying it on David Ortiz's eighth-inning grand slam and winning it in the ninth on Jarrod Saltalamacchia's walk-off single through a drawn-in infield.	Both starters gave up hits in the first inning in the rematch, but it remained scoreless until Bogaerts doubled off the Green Monster with two outs in the fifth and scored on Ellsbury's single.	But the Tigers took the lead on the bottom half, chasing Buchholz with a walk and Miguel Cabrera's single before Franklin Morales walked Prince Fielder on four pitches to load the bases with nobody out.	Victor Martinez lined one high off the Green Monster to make it 2-1, holding at first with a two-run single.	Brandon Workman came in and got Jhonny Peralta to hit a hard grounder to Pedroia, who chased down Martinez in the basepath for one out and then threw home to get Fielder in a rundown. Saltalamacchia ran him back to third and dove, somersaulting over him while making the tag.	Workman struck Alex Avila out looking to end the inning.	"We kind of lucked out and got out of that inning," Pedroia said. "Salty can run."	Scherzer worked out of a jam in the bottom half after putting runners on second and third with one out. He allowed three runs on four hits and five walks, striking out seven in 6 1-3 innings.	Buchholz allowed two runs on four hits and two walks, striking out four in five-plus innings.	Scherzer walked the first two batters in the third, but Victorino popped up a bunt and Scherzer made a sliding catch for the first out.	Pedroia hit a high fly ball that was just foul of the Carlton Fisk pole above the Green Monster. After it was confirmed by replay, he hit a hard grounder down the line that Cabrera fielded, easily stepping on third base before throwing to first for the double play.	NOTES: It will be the first World Series between the teams with the best record in each league since 1999. ... Detroit C Alex Avila, who absorbed a body shot and a foul ball off the mask in Game 5, took another ball off the mask in the fourth but remained in the game. ... The Dropkick Murphys sang the national anthem before the game, followed by "Shipping up to Boston," wearing Red Sox jerseys that said "Boston Strong" and the number 617. ... The Red Sox were 5-0 all time in playoff Game 6s with a 3-2 edge. ... Ellsbury had successfully stolen 18 bases in a row in the regular season and playoffs before being thrown out in the fifth. ... Victorino was hit by a pitch to lead off the sixth, his sixth of the playoffs, extending his record and setting a major league record with the 10th postseason HBP of his career. Alex Rodriguez had the old record.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BOSTON -- An easy toss on a sure out that skittered away. A routine popup that somehow dropped between Gold Glovers. And something even more startling -- umpires reversing a key call.	Almost everything fell into place for the Boston Red Sox in the World Series opener.	Mike Napoli hit a three-run double right after a game-changing decision in the first inning, Jon Lester made the early lead stand up and the Red Sox romped past the sloppy St. Louis Cardinals 8-1 on Wednesday night for their ninth straight win in a World Series game.	A season before Major League Baseball is expected to expand instant replay, fans got to see a preview. The entire six-man crew huddled and flipped a ruling on a forceout at second base -- without looking at any video.	"I think based on their group conversation, surprisingly, to a certain extent, they overturned it and I think got the call right," Boston manager John Farrell said.	David Ortiz was robbed of a grand slam by Carlos Beltran -- a catch that sent the star right fielder to a hospital with bruised ribs -- but "Big Papi" later hit a two-run homer after third baseman David Freese's bad throw.	The Red Sox also capitalized on two errors by shortstop Pete Kozma to extend a Series winning streak that began when they swept St. Louis in 2004. Boston never trailed at any point in those four games and coasted on this rollicking night at Fenway Park, thanks to a hideous display by the Cardinals.	It got so bad for St. Louis that the sellout crowd literally laughed when pitcher Adam Wainwright and catcher Yadier Molina, who have combined to win six Gold Gloves, let an easy popup drop untouched between them.	Serious-minded St. Louis manager Mike Matheny didn't find anything funny, especially when the umpires changed a call by Dana DeMuth at second base.	"Basically, the explanation is that's not a play I've ever seen before. And I'm pretty sure there were six umpires on the field that had never seen that play before, either," Matheny said.	"It's a pretty tough time to debut that overruled call in the World Series. Now, I get that they're trying to get the right call, I get that. Tough one to swallow," he said.	DeMuth said he never actually saw Kozma drop the ball.	"My vision was on the foot. And when I was coming up, all I could see was a hand coming out and the ball on the ground. All right? So I was assuming," DeMuth told a pool reporter.	There was no dispute, however, that the umpires properly ruled Kozma had not caught a soft toss from second baseman Matt Carpenter on a potential forceout. That's what crew chief John Hirschbeck told Matheny.	"I just explained to him ... that five of us were 100 percent sure," Hirschbeck said. "Our job is to get the play right. And that's what we did.	"I said, 'I know you are not happy with it, that it went against you, but you have to understand that the play is correct.'"	The normally slick-fielding Cardinals looked sloppy at every turn. Wainwright bounced a pickoff throw, Molina let a pitch trickle off his mitt, center fielder Shane Robinson bobbled the carom on Napoli's double and there was a wild pitch.	The Cardinal Way? More like, no way.	"We had a wake-up call. That is not the kind of team that we've been all season," Matheny said. "And they're frustrated. I'm sure embarrassed to a point."	Game 2 is Thursday night, with 22-year-old rookie sensation Michael Wacha starting for St. Louis against John Lackey. Wacha is 3-0 with a 0.43 ERA this postseason.	Beltran is day-to-day after X-rays were negative.	Lester blanked the Cardinals on five hits over 7 2/3 innings and struck out eight for his third win this postseason.	"We wanted to set the tone and get them swinging," he said.	Ryan Dempster gave up Matt Holliday's leadoff home run in the ninth.	Boston brought the beards and made it a most hairy night for St. Louis. The Cardinals wrecked themselves with just their second three-error game of the season.	The umpires made a mistake, too, but at least they got to fix it in a hurry.	After the control-conscious Wainwright walked leadoff man Jacoby Ellsbury in the first inning, Dustin Pedroia singled him to second with one out.	Ortiz then hit a slow grounder to Carpenter, and it didn't appear the Cardinals could turn a double play. Hurrying, Kozma let the backhanded flip glance off his glove.	DeMuth instantly called Pedroia out, indicating that Kozma dropped the ball while trying to transfer it to his throwing hand. Farrell quickly popped out of the dugout to argue while Pedroia went to the bench.	Farrell argued with every umpire he could and must have made a persuasive case. As the fans hollered louder and louder as they studied TV replays, all the umpires gathered on the dirt near shortstop and conferred. They decided there was no catch at all.	"You rarely see that, especially on a stage like this," Napoli said. "But I think that was good for the game."	Pedroia came bounding from the dugout, and suddenly, the bases were loaded in the first. Napoli unloaded them with a double that rolled to the Green Monster in left-center.	Napoli, with maybe the bushiest beard of all, certainly picked up where he left off the last time he saw the Cardinals in October. In the 2011 Series, he hit .350 with two home runs and 10 RBIs as Texas lost in seven games to St. Louis.	The Red Sox added to their 3-0 lead with two more runs in the second. A fielding error by Kozma set up Pedroia's RBI single.	The whole inning got going when Stephen Drew's popup in front of the mound landed at Wainwright's feet, a step or two from Molina. The ace pitcher and the star catcher both hung their heads.	"I called it. I waited for someone else to take charge. That's not the way to play baseball. It was totally my error," Wainwright said.	Ortiz, who hit a tying grand slam at Fenway in the American League Championship Series win over Detroit, sent a long drive to right-center. Beltran, playing in his first World Series, braced himself with one hand on the low wall in front of the bullpen and reached over with his glove to make the catch.	"At least I got an RBI and we were up four and got the momentum," Ortiz said.	Beltran hurt himself on the play and left in the third inning.	Ortiz homered in the seventh, and the Red Sox got another run in the eighth on a sacrifice fly by 21-year-old rookie Xander Bogaerts.	The Red Sox almost made a terrific play to finish the game. With two outs in the ninth, Freese hit a sharp single and right fielder Shane Victorino nearly threw him out at first base.	NOTES: Lester has pitched 13 1/3 scoreless innings in two Series starts. He closed out a 2007 sweep over Colorado. ... The Red Sox won their fifth straight World Series opener since losing Game 1 to St. Louis in 1967. ...

BOSTON -- Michael Wacha and his Cardinals bullpen provided the power pitching. Carlos Beltran, injected with a painkiller, came through with a huge hit. And this time, it was the Red Sox who were tripped up by fielding failures.	Wacha bested John Lackey in a matchup of present and past rookie sensations, and St. Louis beat Boston 4-2 on Thursday night to even the World Series at a game apiece.	"Somebody would have to kill me in order for me to get out of the lineup," said Beltran, undeterred by bruised ribs that landed him at the hospital a night earlier.	Matt Holliday tripled and scored on Yadier Molina's fourth-inning grounder, but David Ortiz put Boston ahead 2-1 in the sixth when he pounced on an 85 mph changeup for a two-run homer just over the Green Monster in left field.	That ended Wacha's scoreless streak at 18 2/3 innings -- a rookie record for a single postseason -- but it was all he gave up. Selected by St. Louis last year with the first-round draft pick received as compensation when Albert Pujols signed with the Los Angeles Angels, Wacha has been so good lately that a St. Louis restaurant he walked into had named a milkshake after him, the "Wacha Wacha."	The 22-year-old right-hander, the National League Championship Series MVP after beating Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw twice, threw a career-high 114 pitches and allowed two runs, three hits and four walks in six innings with six strikeouts. He improved to 4-0 with a 1.00 ERA in four outings this postseason, matching the amount of regular-season wins he has in his brief career.	"They don't swing at bad pitches, really," Wacha said. "They did a good job tonight grinding out at-bats with me and got the pitch count up."	Wacha's parents and sister made the trip from Texarkana, Texas, and sat bundled in cold-weather clothes in the stands to watch the 19th pick in last year's amateur draft.	"He pitched outstanding," Molina said. "Just one pitch, to a great hitter like 'Big Papi.'"	But then Lackey, who in 2002 with the Angels became the first rookie in 93 years to win a World Series seventh game, faltered in a three-run seventh. St. Louis went ahead when Matt Carpenter hit a sacrifice fly that led to a pair of runs, with the second scoring on errors by catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia and reliever Craig Breslow -- both making their Series debuts.	Beltran, an eight-time All-Star making his first Series appearance at age 36, followed with an RBI single. He had been sent to a hospital for scans Wednesday night after bruising his ribs while banging into the right-field fence to rob Ortiz of a grand slam. Beltran appeared to be wearing protective padding under his jersey.	"When I left the ballpark yesterday, I had very little hope that I was going to be in the lineup with the way I felt," he said. "When I woke up, I woke up feeling a little better. And I came to the ballpark, talked to the trainer. I was able to get treatment and talk to the doctors, and find a way to try anything I could try just to go out there and feel no pain."	He said he took an injection of Toradol to block the pain for five or six hours.	"The good thing is tomorrow I have the day off," he said.	When the Series resumes Saturday night in St. Louis, Jake Peavy starts for the Red Sox and Joe Kelly for the Cardinals. Twenty-nine of the previous 55 teams that won Game 2 to tie the Series went on to take the title.	"Excited to get home. I know everybody is," Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said.	St. Louis' hard-throwing bullpen combined for one-hit relief. Carlos Martinez got six outs, retiring Mike Napoli on an inning-ending popup with two on in the eighth. Trevor Rosenthal struck out the side on 11 pitches in the ninth for a save, whiffing Daniel Nava with a 99 mph fastball to end it.	All three St. Louis pitchers were 23 or younger.	"It doesn't surprise me. Those guys got talent," Molina said. "Like I said before many times, they're not afraid to pitch."	Seeking its second championship in three seasons, St. Louis improved to 7-0 this postseason when scoring first and stopped Boston's World Series winning streak at nine games. That run began with a sweep of the Cardinals in 2004, when St. Louis never led in the Series.	This year's opener was more of the same, with the Cardinals making three errors and the Red Sox romping 8-1.	Lackey, pitching a day after his 35th birthday, returned this year after missing all of 2012 due to elbow surgery and beat Cy Young Award winners David Price and Justin Verlander in the American League playoffs. In his first Series appearance since his Game 7 win 11 years earlier, he couldn't hold the lead Ortiz gave him with his 17th postseason homer, his fifth this year.	David Freese walked with one out in the seventh, and Jon Jay singled. Breslow relieved, and the Cardinals pulled off a double steal as pinch runner Pete Kozma swiped third -- an uncharacteristically aggressive move for the Cardinals, who ranked last in the NL with 45 stolen bases this season.	Daniel Descalso, who started at shortstop after Kozma made two errors in the opener, loaded the bases with a walk. Carpenter followed with a fly to medium left, and Jonny Gomes' throw home was slightly to the first-base side of the plate as Kozma scored the tying run.	The ball glanced off Saltalamacchia's mitt as Jay took off for third. Breslow smartly backed up the plate -- he's likely the first major leaguer holding a degree from Yale with a major in molecular biophysics and biochemistry -- but he was slow to throw to third. And when he did let loose, the ball sailed over shortstop Stephen Drew covering the base and bounced into the stands.	"It just kind of sailed on me," Breslow said. "I've made a throw of that distance before."	Jay came home with the go-ahead run, and Descalso raced to third.	"We're human. It happens," Saltalamacchia said. "We saw them do the same thing last night. They shook it off and came out tonight and played well. That's what we're going to do."	Beltran singled to right for a two-run lead. With a bullpen that's held opponents to a .169 average in the postseason, that was enough.	"We've got to go out there and play better than we did tonight," Ortiz said. "Nobody can dictate that you're going to win four straight games every time you go out there for the World Series."	NOTES: The Red Sox had not lost in the Series since Game 7 in 1986 against the New York Mets. ... With no designated hitter allowed in the NL ballpark, Boston manager John Farrell said Ortiz likely will play first base in Game 3. Napoli would sit. ... Victims of the Boston Marathon bombings were honored during the seventh-inning stretch as singer James Taylor led the crowd in "America the Beautiful."	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

ST. LOUIS -- The Cardinals rushed to the plate to congratulate Allen Craig. The Red Sox stormed home to argue with the umpires.	The fans, well, they seemed too startled to know what to do. Who'd ever seen an obstruction call to end a World Series game?	No one.	In perhaps the wildest finish imaginable, the rare ruling against third baseman Will Middlebrooks allowed Craig to score with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning and lifted St. Louis over Boston 5-4 Saturday night for a 2-1 edge.	A walk-off win? More like a trip-off.	"I'm in shock right now," St. Louis catcher Yadier Molina said.	So was most everyone at Busch Stadium after the mad-cap play.	"Tough way to have a game end, particularly of this significance," Red Sox manager John Farrell said.	After an umpire's call was the crux of Game 1 and a poor Boston throw to third base decided Game 2, the key play on this night combined both elements.	Molina singled with one out in the ninth off losing pitcher Brandon Workman. Craig, just back from a sprained foot, pinch-hit and lined Koji Uehara's first pitch into left field for a double that put runners on second and third.	With the infield in, Jon Jay hit a grounder to diving second baseman Dustin Pedroia. He made a sensational stab and threw home to catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia, who tagged out the sliding Molina.	But then Saltalamacchia threw wide of third trying to get Craig. The ball glanced off Middlebrooks' glove and Craig's body, caroming into foul territory down the line.	After the ball got by, Middlebrooks, lying on his stomach, raised both legs and tripped Craig, slowing him down as he tried to take off for home.	"I just know I have to dive for that ball. I'm on the ground. There's nowhere for me to go," Middlebrooks said.	Third base umpire Jim Joyce immediately signaled obstruction.	"With the defensive player on the ground, without intent or intent, it's still obstruction," Joyce said. "You'd probably have to ask Middlebrooks that one, if he could have done anything. But that's not in our determination."	Craig kept scrambling.	"He was in my way. I couldn't tell you if he tried to trip me or not. I was just trying to get over him," he said.	Left fielder Daniel Nava retrieved the ball and made a strong throw home, where Saltalamacchia tagged a sliding Craig in time. But plate umpire Dana DeMuth signaled safe and then pointed to third, making clear the obstruction had been called.	"I was excited at first because we nailed the guy at home. I wasn't sure why he was called safe," Middlebrooks said.	"We're all running to home to see why he was called safe. We didn't think there was any obstruction there, obviously. As I'm getting up, he trips over me. I don't know what else to say."	Said Cardinals slugger Matt Holliday: "You hate for it to end on a somewhat controversial play."	"You would like for it to end a little cleaner, but that's part of it," he said.	Joyce and crew chief John Hirschbeck said they'd never seen a similar game-ending play.	A neat coincidence, though: In 2004, umpire Paul Emmel called obstruction on Seattle shortstop Jose Lopez, ruling he blocked Carl Crawford's sightline and giving Tampa Bay the game-ending run. Emmel was the first base umpire on this night, too.	The umpires all agreed Joyce got it right. Until now, he was best known for making an admittedly wrong call in 2010 that denied Detroit's Armando Galarraga a perfect game.	Game 4 is Sunday night, with Clay Buchholz starting for Boston against Lance Lynn.	To some Cardinals fans, the call meant long overdue payback. They're still smarting from Don Denkinger's missed call that helped cost them the 1985 World Series.	To some Red Sox fans, the tangle might've brought back painful memories from the 1975 World Series. In Game 3, Cincinnati's Ed Armbrister wasn't called for interference by plate umpire Larry Barnett when he blocked Boston catcher Carlton Fisk on a 10th-inning bunt. Fisk made a wild throw, setting up Joe Morgan's winning single.	Craig returned for this Series from a sprained left foot that had sidelined him since early September. After an awkward slide on the final play, he hobbled off the field in apparent discomfort.	The Red Sox scored twice in the eighth to tie it 4-all. Jacoby Ellsbury led off with a single and Shane Victorino was hit by a pitch for the sixth time this postseason. Both runners moved up on Pedroia's groundout, and David Ortiz was intentionally walked.	Cardinals manager Mike Matheny went to hard-throwing closer Trevor Rosenthal with the bases loaded, hoping for a five-out save from a rookie who has looked almost untouchable this October. But the Red Sox pushed two runs across.	Nava drove in one with a short-hop grounder that was smothered by second baseman Kolten Wong, who had just entered on defense in a double-switch.	Wong went to second for the forceout, but Nava beat the relay and Ellsbury scored to make it 4-3. Xander Bogaerts tied it when he chopped a single up the middle.	Workman jammed Holliday and retired the slugger on a routine fly with two on to end the bottom of the eighth. That sent the game to the ninth tied at 4. Rosenthal wound up with the win.	Holliday's two-run double put the Cardinals on top 4-2 in the seventh.	It was a tough inning for Red Sox reliever Craig Breslow. Matt Carpenter reached safely when he checked his swing on an infield single to shortstop. Carlos Beltran was grazed on the elbow pad by a pitch -- making no effort to get out of the way.	Beltran, in fact, almost appeared to stick his elbow out just a tiny bit to make sure the ball made contact.	Junichi Tazawa came on and Holliday pulled a grounder past Middlebrooks at third. The ball kicked into the left-field corner and Holliday went all the way to third on the throw to the plate.	Tazawa then got a couple of strikeouts and prevented further damage.	It was Middlebrooks' first inning in the field. He entered as a pinch-hitter in the top of the seventh and took over at third base in the bottom half.	That shifted Bogaerts to shortstop -- and neither one was able to make the difficult defensive play Boston needed in that inning.	Cardinals starter Joe Kelly, one of the few major league pitchers to wear glasses on the mound, set down his first nine batters. The Red Sox seemed to see him better the next time around in coming back from a 2-0 deficit.	Bogaerts opened the fifth with a triple that banged-up right fielder Beltran couldn't quite reach. The rookie later scored on a grounder by pinch-hitter Mike Carp.	Victorino, who has been in a slump, drew a leadoff walk from Kelly in the sixth and wound up scoring the tying run. Ortiz grounded a single off lefty reliever Randy Choate, and Nava greeted Seth Maness with an RBI single that made it 2-all.	Their fielding woes from Game 1 far behind them, the slick-fielding Cardinals made several sharp plays. Kelly barehanded a one-hopper, Carpenter threw out a runner from his knees up the middle and third baseman David Freese backhanded a line drive.	St. Louis quickly broke ahead, scoring in the first inning for the first time this October on RBI singles by Holliday and Molina. After the Cardinals got three hits in a span of four pitches, Red Sox reliever Felix Doubront began heating up in a hurry before Jake Peavy settled down.	NOTES: With no DH, Red Sox slugger Mike Napoli was on the bench. Workman batted in the ninth and struck out; Farrell said he needed another inning from the reliever. ... Cardinals Hall of Famers Bob Gibson, Lou Brock, Ozzie Smith and Red Schoendienst took part in the first-ball festivities, with fan favorite Willie McGee tossing the pitch. ... At 21, Bogaerts became the third-youngest player to hit a triple in a World Series. Ty Cobb and Mickey Mantle did it at 20. ... Molina has a six-game hitting streak in World Series play. ... The family of late umpire Wally Bell was in the stands. Bell died at 48 this month, and the six-man crew is wearing patches to honor him. Bell's first plate job in the World Series was at this ballpark in 2006.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ST. LOUIS -- There's no telling how these wacky World Series games will end.	One night after a rare obstruction call, this one finished with a pickoff play -- both firsts in postseason history. Oh, and Jonny Gomes hit a decisive, three-run homer when he wasn't even in the original lineup.	An entertaining, even goofy World Series is tied at two games apiece after the Boston Red Sox beat the St. Louis Cardinals 4-2 on Sunday, ensuring the title will be decided at Fenway Park in Boston.	"What's going on inside here is pretty special, magical," Gomes said.	Inserted into the lineup about 75 minutes before game time after Shane Victorino couldn't shake off a bad back, Gomes hit a tiebreaking shot off reliever Seth Maness in the sixth inning.	Felix Doubront and surprise reliever John Lackey, both starters during the regular season, picked up for a gritty Clay Buchholz to help the Red Sox hang on.	And of course, another bizarre ending: Koji Uehara picked off rookie pinch-runner Kolten Wong at first base for the final out -- with postseason star Carlos Beltran standing at the plate.	"I feel bad for the kid. I know he's trying to steal a base or put himself in a position where he can score," Beltran said. "But the best way for us to pick him up is to come here tomorrow and get a win."	Game 5 is Monday night at Busch Stadium, with Boston left-hander Jon Lester facing Cardinals ace Adam Wainwright in a rematch of the opener, won 8-1 by the Red Sox.	No telling what's next.	Of the 1,404 postseason games in major league history, none had previously ended on an obstruction call or a pickoff, according to STATS.	"It was the first time for me to end a game like that as far as I can remember," Uehara said through a translator.	Wong's eyes were red from tears when he spoke after the game.	"I was ready to go from first to third with Carlos driving me in," he said. "Went to plant, and my back foot just came right out of me. From there, I was dead. I knew I was dead once it happened."	Wong also apologized on Twitter for getting picked off: "All i want to say is i'm sorry #CardinalNation I go out everyday playing this game as hard as I can and leaving everything on the field."	Gomes, a journeyman who first made it to the majors nearly nine months after a heart attack on Christmas Eve in 2002, arrived at Busch Stadium expecting to watch the game from the bench. Given his chance, he helped Boston get started in the fifth inning when he followed David Ortiz's leadoff double with a 10-pitch walk that wore down starter Lance Lynn, who had faced the minimum 12 batters through the first four innings.	Stephen Drew's sacrifice fly made it 1-1, erasing a deficit created when center fielder Jacoby Ellsbury's third-inning error advanced Matt Carpenter into scoring position for Beltran's RBI single.	Ortiz, who is 8-for-11 (.727) in the series after a three-hit night, was Boston's leader, smacking his hands together and screaming at teammates to get going when he pulled into second base on his double. Then, after the fifth inning, he huddled the Red Sox for a pep talk in the dugout.	"Let's loosen up and let's try to play baseball the way we normally do," Ortiz remembered telling them. "I know we are a better team than what we had shown. Sometimes you get to this stage and you try to overdo things, and it doesn't work that way."	Message heard.	"It was like 24 kindergartners looking up at their teacher," Gomes said, "He got everyone's attention, and we looked him right in the eyes. That message was pretty powerful."	Not long after, Gomes' drive put Boston ahead 4-1.	With adrenaline taking over, Gomes spiked an arm through the air as he rounded first base, yelled and banged his chest with his right fist twice. Teammates tugged on Gomes' beard for good luck when he got back to the dugout, including a two-handed pull by Mike Napoli.	While talk of umpires' calls dominated discussion following two of the opening three games, this one turned on a manager's pregame decision.	John Farrell's original lineup didn't include Gomes, but Victorino's back had been bothering him since Saturday, so Daniel Nava was moved from left field to right and from fifth to second in the batting order. Gomes was inserted into the No. 5 hole behind Ortiz.	"During batting practice, when I met with Shane today, he said, 'Yeah, put me in there. I'll find a way to get ready to start the game,'" Farrell said. "As we went through the other work, it became obvious he wasn't capable. And you know what? It turns out that his replacement is the difference in this one tonight."	Gomes had been 0-for-9 in the series before the home run, and Red Sox outfielders had been 4-for-40 with no RBIs. Following Dustin Pedroia's two-out single and a four-pitch walk to Ortiz by Lynn, Maness threw five straight sinkers to Gomes, who sent the last one into the Red Sox bullpen in left as Matt Holliday kept running back only to run out of room.	"It was right down the middle," Maness said. "That's baseball, it happens."	Carpenter singled home a run in the seventh off Craig Breslow after pinch-hitter Shane Robinson doubled with two outs against Doubront. Junichi Tazawa came in and got Holliday to hit an inning-ending grounder to second, a night after allowing a tiebreaking, two-run double to the slugger.	Doubront got the win with 2 2/3 innings of one-hit relief. Lackey, the Game 2 loser and Boston's probable Game 6 starter, pitched the eighth for his first relief appearance in nine years, overcoming a two-base throwing error by third baseman Xander Bogaerts -- Boston's seventh error of the series -- and a wild pitch.	With a runner on third, Lackey got Jon Jay to pop up and David Freese to ground out.	"It's been a while for sure," Lackey said, "but I got through it and got to the closer."	Uehara, Boston's sixth pitcher, got three outs for his sixth save this postseason, completing a six-hitter.	Lynn was the hard-luck loser, leaving with the score tied and two on for Maness, who allowed Gomes' homer on his fifth pitch.	"As a competitor, you want the opportunity to maybe pitch yourself out of the inning," Lynn said. "I'm not happy when I come out of a game -- ever. That's just part of being a competitor."	It was a special anniversary for both teams. Exactly nine years ago, the Red Sox completed a four-game sweep of the Cardinals across the street at old Busch Stadium for their first championship since 1918. And two years ago, Freese hit a tying, two-run, two-out triple in the ninth against the Texas Rangers and a winning homer in the 11th to force a Game 7, which St. Louis won the following night.	Buchholz, in his first appearance since the AL Championship Series finale on Oct. 19, fought through shoulder issues and his velocity topped out at 90 mph. He lasted a season-low four innings and 66 pitches before he was lifted for a pinch-hitter, but he allowed just an unearned run and three hits.	"I don't think I had the fastball I usually had. But I had some more movement on my other pitches and had some good defense behind me," Buchholz said. "I felt like I gave it all that I could while I was out there."	And on another strange night, it was enough.	Game notes	St. Louis had been 8-0 this postseason when scoring first. ... Cardinals C Yadier Molina extended his World Series hitting streak to seven games. ... Holliday argued with plate umpire Paul Emmel after he was called out on strikes in the fifth, and Cardinals manager Mike Matheny came on the field to make sure his left fielder didn't get ejected. ... Beltran is 8-for-10 with 12 RBIs with runners in scoring position during the postseason. ... Just one regular-season game this year ended with a pickoff, when Houston's Jose Veras caught Jordan Danks of the Chicago White Sox at second on June 15, STATS said.

ST. LOUIS -- Jon Lester pitched the Boston Red Sox within a whisker of yet another World Series championship.	Now, this bearded band goes back to Fenway Park just one win away.	"Pretty special time," Lester said.	Lester bested Adam Wainwright once again, journeyman David Ross hit a tiebreaking double in the seventh inning and the Red Sox downed the St. Louis Cardinals 3-1 on Monday night to take a 3-2 Series edge.	David Ortiz delivered his latest big hit, too, putting Boston in position to capture its third crown in a decade. Not since 1918 have the Red Sox clinched the title at their century-old bandbox.	"The fact is we're going home," manager John Farrell said. "Going back to a place that our guys love to play in, in front of our fans.	"This atmosphere here, these three games, has been phenomenal. We know it's going to be equal to that, if not better. And we're excited about going home in the position we are."	Said Ortiz: "It's going to get loud out there."	John Lackey gets the first chance to win it Wednesday night against St. Louis rookie sensation Michael Wacha. A Cardinals victory would set up a most spooky proposition for both teams -- Game 7 on Halloween night.	"It will be legendary if we go into Boston and win two games," Wainwright said.	Ortiz enjoyed even more success in Game 5 after moving up from cleanup to the third slot. He is 11-for-15 (.733) in the series with two homers, six RBIs and four walks.	"I was born for this," Ortiz said, grinning.	He left in a double switch, shortly after legging out a single in the eighth. He was OK, and he already had done enough damage to the Cardinals.	"What planet's that guy from?" Ross said.	Lester enhanced his reputation as an October ace with every pitch. He allowed one run and four hits in 7 2/3 innings, striking out seven without a walk. It was nearly the same line he had in beating Wainwright in the opener.	"I think the biggest thing is me and Rossy have had a good rhythm," Lester said of his primary catcher. "Early on, we just went back to our game plan from Game 1 and just fell back on that and really just tried to make them swing the bats early, and we were able to do that."	The lefty, who has won all three of his career World Series starts, had just one rough inning, when Matt Holliday homered in the fourth, Carlos Beltran flied out to the wall and Yadier Molina hit a liner. Other than that, Lester was as sharp as a knife and at one point retired 12 in a row.	He tweaked himself late but said he was all right. In fact, Lester's biggest brush with major trouble came well before his first pitch.	Lester was getting loose near the warning track when a team of eight Clydesdales pulling a beer wagon came trotting by. He moved aside to watch the Busch Stadium tradition.	He also took a brief break in the seventh. A giant paper airplane floated down from the stands, and some fans cheered its flight as it landed near the mound. Lester handed it to a ball boy, then got Molina to line out to shortstop to end the inning.	"It was a tough loss. It was 1-1 in the seventh -- that was obviously the game. Tip your cap to Ross; he hit a double to take the lead," Wainwright said. "Their guy Lester did a good job."	Lester did it without any flap over his glove. During Game 1, a Cardinals minor league pitcher posted a picture on Twitter of discoloration on Lester's mitt and wondered whether some foreign substance was there.	Lester said he merely used rosin for a better grip, and Major League Baseball said it didn't see anything wrong.	Koji Uehara got four outs for his second save of the series. No crazy endings this time, either, following one night with an obstruction call and the next with Uehara's game-finishing pickoff.	The Cardinals went quickly in the ninth and now need two wins in Boston. They overcame a 3-2 series deficit at home to beat the Texas Rangers for the 2011 title.	"The guys know what we have to do," manager Mike Matheny said. "We have to play the game. They have to lock arms, trust each other and play the game the right way. Most of it is going to be the mentality of not buying into any kind of stats, any kind of predictions, any kind of odds, and go out and play the game."	Ortiz put Boston ahead with an RBI double in the first, hitting the first pitch after Dustin Pedroia doubled on an 0-2 curve. Ortiz singled the next time up and tied a World Series record by reaching base in nine straight plate appearances.	"Big Papi" and the Red Sox took two of three at the National League park despite playing without a designated hitter. Ortiz became the first baseman, putting slugger Mike Napoli on the bench.	The Red Sox lead the series despite a .205 team batting average. Ortiz has one-third of the team's 33 hits.	Ross, a graybeard on a team led by scraggly veterans, broke a 1-1 tie when he hooked a drive just inside the left-field line, and the ball bounced into the seats for a go-ahead double.	"How about that? It's nice to drive in runs," Ross said. "I've got to credit the guys in front of me."	Jacoby Ellsbury later hit an RBI single, and Ross was thrown out at the plate trying to score on the play.	A day after Ortiz delivered a stirring, in-game pep talk to rev up the Red Sox, the Cardinals could have used some inspiration themselves -- perhaps a visit from the good-luck "rally squirrel" from their 2011 title run.	The St. Louis hitters went quietly, a couple slinging their bats after routine popups and fly balls, and others questioning the calls by plate umpire Bill Miller.	Holliday shook St. Louis' slumber and broke Lester's string with his second home run of the series. Lester had pitched 16 1/3 scoreless innings in his first three World Series starts before Holliday tagged him.	That was all St. Louis got. Not even a revamped lineup that included the hobbled Allen Craig helped the Cards.	Craig, who is still suffering the effects of stretched ligaments in his left foot, was a late replacement for first baseman Matt Adams on Monday. Craig had been batting .444 (4-for-9) in the series but was hitless in three at-bats in Game 5. He and Matheny told MLB.com after the game that he likely will return to designated hitter when the series returns to Boston.	"It just continues to improve, and I can get better," Craig told the website.	Wainwright changed things the next time Ortiz came up, varying his tempo and delivery. Ortiz still hit it hard while lining out to center.	Wainwright struck out 10 in seven innings, becoming the first Cardinals pitcher to reach double digits in a World Series game since Bob Gibson did it twice in 1968 against the Detroit Tigers.	It was a big sports night in St. Louis, with a "Monday Night Football" game between the St. Louis Rams and Seattle Seahawks eight blocks away at the Edward Jones Dome. This is a baseball town, clearly: Football tickets sold for $10 on StubHub as kickoff approached, and fans inside the dome loudly booed when the World Series game was taken off the video board.	The baseball fans got to see Lester do more than pitch. He helped himself in the field, knocking down a hard comebacker and swiftly handling a bunt. He also made a dent with his bat, sort of.	Going in with a career 0-for-31 mark at the plate, he nubbed a ball in front of the plate and was thrown out leading off the third. But at least he broke Wainwright's string of five straight strikeouts, one shy of the postseason record tied by Detroit's Justin Verlander against Boston in the American League Championship Series.

BOSTON -- The old ballpark was packed for a celebration nearly a century in the making.	Players danced around the infield with their families.	Fans remained in the stands, savoring a long-awaited moment generations of New Englanders had never been able to witness in person.	Turmoil to triumph. Worst to first. A clincher at Fenway Park.	David Ortiz and the Boston Red Sox, baseball's bearded wonders, capped their remarkable turnaround by beating the St. Louis Cardinals 6-1 in Game 6 on Wednesday night to win their third World Series championship in 10 seasons.	When it was over, Ortiz took a microphone on the field and addressed the city, just as he did a week after the Boston Marathon bombings in April.	"This is for you, Boston. You guys deserve it," the Series MVP said. "We've been through a lot this year, and this is for all of you and all those families who struggled."	And the Red Sox didn't even have to fly the trophy home. For the first time since Babe Ruth's team in 1918, Boston won the title at Fenway. The 101-year-old stadium, oldest in the majors, was packed with 38,447 singing, shouting fans anticipating a party building for more than nine decades.	"Maybe they won't have to go another 95 years," said John Farrell, a champion in his first season as Boston's manager.	Shane Victorino, symbolic of these resilient Sox, returned from a stiff back and got Boston rolling with a three-run double off the Green Monster against rookie sensation Michael Wacha. Pumped with emotion, Victorino pounded his chest with both fists three times.	John Lackey became the first pitcher to start and win a Series clincher for different teams, allowing one run over 6 2/3 innings 11 years after his Game 7 victory as an Angels rookie in 2002.	With fans roaring on every pitch and cameras flashing, Koji Uehara struck out Matt Carpenter for the final out. Uehara jumped into the arms of catcher David Ross while Red Sox players rushed from the dugout and bullpen as the Boston theme "Dirty Water" played on the public-address system.	There wasn't the "Cowboy Up!" comeback charm of "The Idiots" from 2004, who swept St. Louis to end an 86-year title drought. There wasn't that cool efficiency of the 2007 team that swept Colorado.	This time, the Red Sox were "Boston Strong" -- playing for a city shaken by tragedy.	"We've dealt with a lot," Dustin Pedroia said. "But our team came together."	After a late-season collapse in 2011, the embarrassing revelations of a chicken-and-beer clubhouse culture that contributed to the ouster of manager Terry Francona, and the daily tumult of Bobby Valentine's one-year flop, these Red Sox grew on fans.	Just like the long whiskers on the players' faces, starting with Jonny Gomes' scruffy spring training beard.	"As soon as we went to Fort Myers, the movie's already been written," Gomes said. "All we had to do was press play, and this is what happened."	The only player remaining from the 2004 champs, Ortiz had a Ruthian World Series. He batted .688 (11-for-16) with two homers, six RBIs and eight walks -- including four in the finale -- for a .760 on-base percentage in 25 plate appearances, the second-highest in Series history.	"We have a lot of players with heart. We probably don't have the talent that we had in '07 and '04, but we have guys that are capable [of staying] focused and [doing] the little things," Ortiz said.	Even slumping Stephen Drew delivered a big hit in Game 6, sending Wacha's first pitch of the fourth into the right-center bullpen for a 4-0 lead. By the time the inning was over, RBI singles by Mike Napoli and Victorino had made it 6-0, and the Red Sox were on their way.	"Hey, I missed two games. It's time to shine," Victorino said.	All over New England, from Connecticut's Housatonic River up to the Aroostook in Maine, Boston's eighth championship can be remembered for the beard-yanking bonding.	Fans bid up the average ticket price to more than $1,000 on the resale market, and some prime seat locations went for more than $10,000 each. Nearly all the Red Sox rooters stood in place for 30 minutes after the final out to view the presentation of the trophy and MVP award. A few thousand remained when a beaming Ortiz returned to the field with his son 75 minutes after the final out.	"It was an awesome atmosphere here," Lackey said.	The win capped an emotional season for the Red Sox, one heavy with the memory of the events that unfolded on Patriots Day, when three people were killed and more than 260 wounded in bombing attacks at the Boston Marathon. The Red Sox wore "Boston Strong" logos on their left sleeves, erected a large emblem on the Green Monster and moved the logo into the center-field grass as a constant reminder.	"There's I think a civil responsibility that we have wearing this uniform, particularly here in Boston," Farrell said. "And it became a connection initially, the way our guys reached out to individuals or to hospital visits. And it continued to build throughout the course of the season. I think our fans, they got to a point where they appreciated the way we played the game, how they cared for one another. And in return, they gave these guys an incredible amount of energy to thrive on in this ballpark."	Red, white and blue fireworks exploded over the ballpark as commissioner Bud Selig presented the World Series trophy to Red Sox owners John Henry, Tom Werner and Larry Lucchino, leaving a haze over the field.	"When the fireworks went off at the presentation of the trophy out there, when the ballpark was filled with smoke, it was completely surreal," Farrell said. "To be in this position, given where we've come from, reflecting back a year ago at this time, there's been a lot that's happened in 13 months."	Players then put on goggles for a champagne celebration in the cramped clubhouse.	"They just found ways to win," Henry said. "At some point, you have to think there's something special happening here."	Among the players blamed for the indifferent culture at the end of the Francona years, Lackey took the mound two days shy of the second anniversary of his elbow surgery and got his first Series win since the 2002 clincher. He took a shutout into the seventh, when Carlos Beltran's RBI single ended the Cardinals' slump with runners in scoring position at 0-for-14.	Junichi Tazawa came in with the bases loaded and retired Allen Craig on an inning-ending grounder to first. Brandon Workman followed in the eighth, and Uehara finished.	St. Louis had been seeking its second title in three seasons, but the Cardinals sputtered after arriving in Boston late Tuesday following a seven-hour flight delay caused by mechanical problems. Symbolic of the team's struggles, reliever Trevor Rosenthal tripped while throwing a pitch to Ortiz in the eighth, balking Pedroia to second.	"There were some frustrated guys in there, but overall you can't ask us to go about it any better than how our guys did," Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said. "Not too many people expected us to do what we did."
