ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Albert Pujols' first at-bat Wednesday was much like his final trip to the plate the previous night -- another home run against the Colorado Rockies.	 INLINE TABLE (BEGIN) 	 INLINE TABLE (END) 	Pujols hit his major league-leading 18th homer and Jeff Suppan won his fourth straight start, leading the St. Louis Cardinals to a 7-4 victory.	"He just keeps piling on the examples," manager Tony La Russa said. "That's what's so great about Albert, he does that and he just turns the page. That's Stan Musial stuff."	Juan Encarnacion also homered for the Cardinals, who took two of three from the NL West leaders and have won five of six overall.	Pujols, who hit a go-ahead three-run homer on Tuesday, followed John Rodriguez's first-inning single with a drive to left off Byung-Hyun Kim (1-1). Pujols also leads the majors with 43 RBI and the NL with 35 runs scored, and eight of his homers have given the Cardinals the lead.	"I'm being patient at the plate and just taking what they give me," Pujols said. "There's nothing secret."	Pujols reached 18 homers in 35 games, the second-fastest in major-league history, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Cy Williams of the Philadelphia Phillies did it in 34 games in 1923.	Suppan (4-2) struck out seven and walked none, allowing three runs and six hits in five innings. After going 0-2 in his first three starts, he has lowered his ERA from 9.00 to 4.58.	"I thought it came down to our offense and the bullpen," Suppan said. "With this team, I was just trying to stay out of the big inning."	Jason Isringhausen got three straight outs for his 10th save in 12 chances.	Kim gave up seven runs and 10 hits in 4 2/3 innings, the shortest of his three starts this season.	"His location had been his best friend but today it was his enemy," Rockies manager Clint Hurdle said "His pitch to Pujols, in his defense, wasn't that bad of a pitch. The pitch to	Encarnacion was a bad pitch, it was a cement mixer that stayed in the middle of the plate."	Matt Holliday had an RBI single and tripled for the Rockies, going 7-for-12 in the series with three homers. He is 18-for-36 against the Cardinals in his career with five homers and seven RBI.	"Colorado has a great ballclub," Pujols said. "It's pretty exciting to see a club like that, the way they're playing."	The Rockies had won four straight before losing the last two in the series.	"When we made mistakes, we didn't panic over them," Hurdle said. "We're looking out the windshield, we're not looking out the rearview mirror."	Cory Sullivan's RBI single in the third cut the Cardinals' lead in half, but Pujols doubled in the bottom half and scored on Encarnacion's fifth homer for a 4-1 lead.	Gary Bennett's RBI double with two outs in the fifth chased Kim. Rodriguez added a sacrifice fly in the fourth and Aaron Miles, who was 3-for-4, had an RBI single off David Cortes in the fifth that made it 7-3.	Game notes	The Cardinals are 14-5 at new Busch Stadium, where every game has been a sellout. ... Rockies starters allowed two runs in 14 2/3 innings the first two games of the series. ... David Eckstein had three singles for his team-leading 14th multihit game. He also stole his third base in the sixth. ... Holliday is 3-for-4 against Suppan with two homers and three RBI. ... Encarnacion had a couple nice running catches in right, toppling into the seats after snaring Holliday's fly ball in foul territory to end the fifth. ... The Cardinals signed right-hander Will Cunnane to a contract with Triple-A Memphis, and he was scheduled to start on Wednesday night. Cunnane, 32, last pitched in the minors with the Braves in 2004 and had pitched in the Independent Atlantic League earlier this season.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Struggling Kyle Lohse responded to speculation that his rotation spot was in jeopardy by pitching one of his best games of the season.	Lohse allowed on run in six innings and the Minnesota Twins took advantage of wildness by Vicente Padilla to beat the Texas Rangers 4-3 on Wednesday.	Lohse (2-3) allowed six hits, struck out six and walked four, lowering his ERA from 9.71 to .833.	"You hear a lot of stuff you don't want to hear," Lohse said. "But until they tell me I'm out of the starting five, I'm going to do what I do. There's enough pressure already."	Minnesota won for the fourth time in five games heading into a weekend series against the AL Central-leading Chicago White Sox.	"To win in Texas against that lineup is tough," Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said. "Everybody knows he's been struggling. He needed that for his confidence. Hopefully, he can continue from there."	Lohse said moving his position on the rubber a little closer to first base produced better results.	"It's amazing what a little adjustment like that can do," he said.	Joe Nathan struck out two in a perfect ninth for his fifth save in as many chances.	Padilla forced in the go-ahead run in the seventh inning when he walked two batters and hit two others.	With the score 1-1, Padilla (3-3) walked Torii Hunter and	Michael Cuddyer opening the seventh and then hit Justin Morneau and	Mike Redmond with pitches. Joaquin Benoit relieved and got Tony Batista to ground into a double play as Cuddyer scored for a 3-1 lead and then struck out Juan Castro.	Hunter, batting .517 (15-for-29) during an eight-game hitting streak, added an RBI single off Francisco Cordero in the eighth that made it 4-1.	Mark DeRosa, who went 3-for-3, hit a two-run double against Juan Rincon in the bottom half on a drive off the wall that missed becoming a home run by inches.	"I thought I got it," DeRosa said. "I put a good swing on it and initially thought it was a home run. But that's the way the game goes sometimes."	Hunter went back on DeRosa's line drive and was relieved when the ball stayed in the park.	"They say it's a game of inches and you saw it right there," Hunter said. "It was inches from going out."	With the potential tying run on second, Gerald Laird popped out and pinch-hitter Gary Matthews Jr. grounded out.	Padilla gave up three runs, three hits and three walks in six innings. He was perfect until Lew Ford's single leading off the fourth.	Rangers manager Buck Showalter was ejected by plate umpire Mark Wegner in the fourth. After taking a called third strike, the Rangers' Brad Wilkerson had a few words for Wegner and lingered at the plate. Showalter came out of the dugout to protect his player and was tossed by Wegner.	Showalter was ejected for the first time this season and third in his four years as Rangers manager.	"I went out to get Brad so he could stay in the game," Showalter said. "I guess he thought I was arguing balls and strikes."	Mark Teixeira had an RBI single in the third for the Rangers, who have lost four of five. Hunter hit a run-scoring, double-play grounder in the fourth.	Game notes	Matthews and Rod Barajas weren't in the Rangers' starting lineup. Matthews has been bothered by a sore quadriceps and Barajas was rested. Adrian Brown started in center and Laird was the catcher. ... Gardenhire started Nick Punto at second base instead of Luis Castillo, who has been slowed by a sore knee. Gardenhire did not start outfielder Shannon Stewart because Stewart is recovering from the flu. ... Thursday is the Rangers' only off day in May. Texas opens a 10-game trip Friday night in Boston. ... The Rangers have failed to homer in five of their last six games.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- This is about as balanced as an offense can be.	Every Kansas City Royals starter had one RBI except Kerry Robinson, and he had two in a 10-8 victory over the Cleveland Indians on Wednesday that gave the suddenly revitalized Royals a three-game sweep and a burst of confidence.	Aaron Guiel hit a tiebreaking home run in the eighth inning and Angel Berroa added a home run of his own for the Royals, who have won five of seven after a 5-20 start.	"Guys just seemed to be fighting all the time, having good at-bats," said Guiel, who homered for the second time in two games. "It seems like we don't have to wait for somebody to get	something going."	Kansas City reached double digits in runs in consecutive games for the first time since June 2004, when they won three straight games by 10-4, beating Atlanta twice and Philadelphia once. They hadn't swept the Indians at home since a three-game series from May 9-12, 2002.	"Hitting's very contagious," Doug Mientkiewicz said. "Everybody's swinging the bats a lot better than we were. Guys in general feel much better at the plate as a whole than we did a couple of weeks ago."	Guiel and Berroa connected off Guillermo Mota (0-2) after the Indians had scored three in the eighth to tie it at 8.	"I lost the game," Mota said.	Jake Westbrook, who entered with a 4-2 record and 1.65 ERA against the Royals, gave up eight runs and nine hits in 5 2/3 innings.	"Our offense is swinging the bats too good to be losing a game like that, and it's all my fault," Westbrook said. "I might have got a no-decision, but I lost this game for us."	Ambiorix Burgos (1-0) balked home Ramon Vazquez with the tying run in the eighth but got the victory with 1 2/3 innings of one-hit relief.	Robinson greeted Mota with a two-run triple in a three-run sixth.	Royals starter Scott Elarton gave up three runs in the first on Jason Michaels' RBI double and Jhonny Peralta's two-run homer. Elarton did not allow a hit after the first inning until Casey Blake homered with two outs in the sixth.	"Maybe we'll look back on this and think, 'Kansas City, that was our low point,'" Cleveland's Ben Broussard said.	Game notes	Royals center fielder Shane Costa, on the DL since April 29 with a left hamstring strain, is headed for Arizona for a few days of rehab and expected to rejoin the team at the beginning of next week. ... Kansas City third baseman Tony Graffanino made a nice play in the sixth, running into foul ground to catch Travis Hafner's pop foul in the strong wind. ... Center fielder Grady Sizemore's error in the sixth was his first in 97 games. ... Elarton does not have a win in eight starts	despite a 4.34 ERA.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SEATTLE (AP) -- Jamie Moyer has thrown tens of thousands of pitches over his 20 seasons in the major leagues. A pitch he didn't throw cost him Wednesday.	Seattle's 43-year old lost the grip on a fifth-inning pitch as he was starting his delivery, balking in the only run in the Tampa Bay Devil Rays' 1-0 victory over the Mariners.	"I didn't have the right grip on the ball and recognized it," Moyer said. "My body swayed and I couldn't get my foot out the hole. Simple mistake. It cost me the game."	Scott Kazmir allowed only three singles and struck out nine over seven innings for the Devil Rays, who won for only the third time in 10 games and prevented a Seattle sweep of the three-game series.	The previous major-league game in which the only run came home on a balk was on June 8, 1998, when the New York Mets beat Boston and Tim Wakefield, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.	"Big as Dallas, he did balk," Devil Rays manager Joe Maddon said.	With the count 1-1 to Damon Hollins and runners on second and third in the fifth, Moyer (1-3) asked catcher Rene Rivera to go	through his signs again. After beginning his pitching motion, he stepped awkwardly off the pitching rubber with his back foot and looked blankly to first base.	All four umpires called the balk.	"He started and stopped, his whole body," crew chief Gary Darling said.	Moyer did not argue as Toby Hall strolled home. Instead, he yelled a one-word admonishment at himself.	Two of the three singles off Kazmir (5-2) were infield hits, and the 22-year-old's first five outs were strikeouts. He consistently threw 94 mph fastballs, sharply dropping cut fastballs and looping changeups -- which Seattle had not seen in its scouting.	"I'm feeling a lot more comfortable," he said. "Instead of being overwhelmed and thinking I have to make three perfect pitches to strike a guy out, I'm just making quality pitches."	Kazmir has allowed two runs or fewer in six of his eight starts this season while winning games opposite Roy Halladay, Curt Schilling and Wakefield. He retired 16 in a row between Willie Bloomquist's second-inning single and Adrian Beltre's two-out walk in the seventh.	Bloomquist followed with a single, but pinch-hitter Kenji Johjima grounded out.	"Kaz has been even sharper than that," Maddon said. "It's growing into a typical performance for him.	"Potentially -- and very soon -- he's going to be one of the best left-handers in the game," he said.	Richie Sexson struck out twice against Kazmir, dropping his average to .186.	"It's frustrating, kind of a man-tester," Sexson said. "Hopefully, it will turn."	Ruddy Lugo pitched a perfect eighth and Tyler Walker allowed Raul Ibanez's double to center leading off the ninth. The liner went over Joey Gathright, who had taken three steps in.	Walker then struck out Sexson and Carl Everett, who banged the top of his batting helmet with his bat barrel. Beltre hit the next pitch on one hop to a prone Tomas Perez, who had moved to third base from shortstop in the ninth. Perez got up and threw to first for the final out.	"It's definitely exciting for a young guy to come in and make guys look that bad," Walker said of Kazmir. "The guys in that other clubhouse, you can ask them, they probably don't want to face him again this season."	Moyer again pitched well without a win. He gave up four hits in eight innings, striking out five -- but was doomed by his 11th career balk and first since Aug. 19, 2000, at Cleveland.	Game notes	Kazmir also had a 1-0 win last Sept. 4 at Toronto. ... After Moyer struck out Ty Wigginton to begin the seventh inning, Wigginton twice whacked his bat into a cement side wall of the	dugout. Splinters flew as Wigginton then slammed his batting helmet off a rack. Wigginton, who was leading the AL in with 30 RBI on Sunday, was 0-for-3 and 4-for-20 on Tampa Bay's trip. ... The last time Moyer balked home a run was April 28, 1996, for the Red Sox	versus Kansas City. ... Hall ended an 0-for-15 skid with a double and single.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

BALTIMORE (AP) -- Rookie Justin Verlander put on quite a show for family and friends in his debut at Camden Yards.	His performance also made an impression on the Baltimore Orioles.	Verlander took a five-hitter into the seventh inning, Brandon Inge and Curtis Granderson hit successive homers in a four-run seventh and the Detroit Tigers ended a three-game skid with a 6-3 victory Wednesday night.	Magglio Ordonez went 2-for-4 with a single and a double for the Tigers, but his streak of hitting a homer in consecutive games ended at four. The last Detroit player to homer in five consecutive games was Willie Horton in 1969.	Verlander (4-3) gave up three runs, seven hits and three walks in 6 1/3 innings. He struck out four, including Kevin Millar to	escape a fourth-inning jam.	The small crowd of 15,548 included more than a dozen fans cheering solely for Verlander, a native and resident of nearby Virginia. His parents and girlfriend were among those who watched.	"Some of them were seeing me pitch in the majors for the first time. After the game started, I didn't want to look at where they were sitting," he said.	Verlander has gone at least six innings in six of his seven starts and owns an impressive 3.77 ERA.	"He was throwing 98 mph with good movement, a solid breaking ball and a changeup," Orioles infielder Chris Gomez said. "He's got a pretty good future ahead of him."	Brandon Fahey got a career-high three hits, including two off Verlander, but nevertheless was impressed by the rookie's savvy.	"He changed his pitches every at-bat," Fahey said. "And then, after you get two strikes, he's got such a hard fastball that it's hard to sit on an off-speed pitch."	Detroit led 2-1 before pulling away against Rodrigo Lopez (1-5) in the seventh. Chris Shelton walked and Craig Monroe singled before Inge hit his eighth homer. Two pitches later, Granderson chased Lopez with a shot to center.	"Things seemed like they were going pretty good, and then one inning turned everything around," Lopez said.	In the bottom half, Baltimore used two singles and a walk to load the bases against Verlander with one out. Joel Zumaya forced in a run by hitting Gomez with a pitch, and Miguel Tejada hit a	sacrifice fly to make it 6-3.	Zumaya gave up a hit and a walk in the eighth, and Todd Jones got three outs for his seventh save.	"The kid pitched a good game and the old-timer [Jones] pitched well, too," Detroit manager Jim Leyland said.	The Orioles have lost six of seven and nine of 11. Baltimore was without third baseman Melvin Mora, who missed his first game of the season with a sore back, an injury he sustained in Tuesday night's win over Detroit.	Gomez hurt his left hand when hit by the pitch from Zumaya, left the game for a pinch-hitter in the ninth inning and likely won't be available until the weekend.	"It's pretty sore," Gomez said. "I tried to grip a bat and couldn't do it."	Lopez allowed six runs and eight hits in six-plus innings. He is winless in seven starts since opening day and has yielded at least four runs in every appearance this season.	"I can't believe this is happening, but it's true," Lopez said. "Mentally I have to be positive and keep pitching and keep fighting until things work for me."	Detroit took a 2-0 lead in the first. After missing four games with a sore back, Placido Polanco hit a one-out double and scored his 500th career run on a double by Ordonez. Carlos Guillen	followed with an RBI single.	Baltimore got a run back in the fourth. Jay Gibbons doubled and Ramon Hernandez walked before Corey Patterson hit a two-out RBI single to put runners at the corners. Verlander then struck out Millar.	Game notes	After the game, the Tigers optioned right-hander Jordan Tata to Triple-A Toledo. Right-hander Roman Colon will join the team on Thursday. ... Monroe's seventh-inning single snapped a 1-for-23 skid. ...	Lopez hasn't gotten past the seventh inning in five starts since April 14. ... It was the second time this year that Inge and Granderson hit consecutive homers. The first was against Cleveland on April 14.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK (AP) -- Hey Boss, Alex Rodriguez got the big hit against	Boston.	A-Rod had a powerful answer for George Steinbrenner's criticism,	and the New York Yankees roughed up old nemesis Curt Schilling in a	7-3 victory over the Red Sox on Wednesday night.	Jason Giambi, Jorge Posada and Rodriguez all homered off	Schilling, sending the Yankees to their first win this season	against their longtime rivals.	"I'm judged just the way I should be judged. I make an awful	lot of money and I'm a talented guy," Rodriguez said. "I expect	all the criticism, and it motivates me."	Mike Mussina (6-1) provided stability on a hectic day in the	Bronx, settling down after a shaky start to become the American	League's first six-game winner.	David Ortiz hit a two-run homer and went 4-for-4, ending his	2-for-24 skid. Mike Lowell's solo shot gave Schilling a 3-0 lead,	but he couldn't hold it and the Red Sox had their five-game winning	streak snapped.	"These games have so much passion and people care so much about	them, but they are all the same in the standings," Boston manager	Terry Francona said.	Johnny Damon added an RBI single for New York, his first hit in	11 at-bats against his former team. The Yankees rebounded from a	14-3 drubbing the night before and improved to 1-2 against Boston.	"It's a big win for us simply because of the way we got beat up	last night," Mussina said.	Shawn Chacon faces Red Sox knuckleballer Tim Wakefield in the	series finale Thursday night.	Rodriguez was singled out in critical quotes attributed to	Steinbrenner after making two errors Tuesday night.	"I'm upset at a lot of them," the owner was quoted as saying	in New York newspapers on Wednesday. "The third baseman!"	But manager Joe Torre said Steinbrenner called him and told him	his comments were misinterpreted. Torre said The Boss told him he	never meant to "get on" any of his players.	Rodriguez responded with a tiebreaking shot in the fifth inning	and said nobody expects more of him than he does himself.	"Alex is sensitive. I know he's a great talent and all that	stuff, but he certainly wants everybody to be proud of him," Torre	said. "He's going to have to deal with it and move on. He doesn't	need motivation."	Besides all that buzz before the game, the Yankees sent	struggling ace Randy Johnson for an MRI to make sure he isn't hurt.	Tests on his left shoulder showed nothing abnormal, the team said.	Mussina won his fifth straight start, allowing three runs and	seven hits in 6 2-3 innings for his 230th career win. He struck out	five, walked one and departed to chants of "Mooooose!"	Scott Proctor, supplanting Tanyon Sturtze as Torre's go-to guy	in the seventh inning, brushed Manny Ramirez back, then struck out	the slugger to strand two runners.	"I knew I could get him away. I've done it before," Proctor	said. "This is the way I knew I could pitch, and I'm finally	pitching to my potential. Just knowing that (Torre) has faith in me	gives me confidence."	Proctor also worked a perfect eighth and Mariano Rivera finished	up for the Yankees (19-12), who have won six of seven and eight of	10 to match their season high of seven games over .500.	Schilling (5-2) gave up eight hits and a season-high six runs in	five innings, his shortest outing this year. He had allowed four	homers in 47 2-3 innings entering the game.	"I felt like I had everything working. I gave it, and they took	it back," Schilling said. "It was a very small strike zone.	Anytime you have to go against either of these lineups and the	strike zone is smaller than you're used to, you have to make	adjustments. He did it and I didn't."	With the score tied at 3, Schilling struck out Derek Jeter and	Giambi to start the fifth, then ran into trouble. Rodriguez, booed	by fans early in the game, drove a 2-1 pitch way over the	left-field fence for his seventh homer this season and first at	Yankee Stadium.	"He needed that," Giambi said.	Satisfied with his quick, powerful swing, Rodriguez tossed his	bat aside as he began to circle the bases.	"We realize that it's been tough for him. We realize that	everybody expects him to go 4-for-5 with two homers every game	against Boston, and if he doesn't it's a disappointment. But he's a	pretty good player," Mussina said. "I know it was a big hit. It	was a big deal, and most of us that have been here a while realize	it."	Schilling, of course, helped Boston rally from 3-0 down to beat	the Yankees in the 2004 AL championship series and was co-MVP of	Arizona's World Series win over New York in 2001. He also was one	of several Red Sox to criticize A-Rod before the 2005 season.	Rodriguez responded back then by saying it was "going to give	us great motivation to beat him up in the future."	But after Wednesday's win, Rodriguez said: "I have all the	respect for Curt. He's a great pitcher, so don't even go there."	Later in the inning, Posada hit a two-run drive into the	right-field upper deck.	Game notes	Lowell's previous eight hits were doubles, the longest such	streak since Gerald Williams of the Yankees did it in 1995. ...	Mussina improved to 18-14 against Boston in the regular season,	including 9-8 with the Yankees. He was 0-2 with a 7.20 ERA in four	starts vs. the Red Sox last year.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Tom Glavine used his bat and his arm to end Philadelphia's longest winning streak in 15 years.	Glavine pitched seven strong innings and drove in a pair of runs to help the New York Mets beat Philadelphia 13-4 on Wednesday night, snapping the Phillies' nine-game winning streak.	The Mets pounded Phillies starter Cory Lidle (3-4) early, with eight players getting hits and all nine scoring while building a 10-0 lead through three innings. The NL East-leading Mets pushed their lead back to four games over the second-place Phillies, who were on their longest winning streak since a 13-game run in 1991.	"It was a nice game for me to have an early lead and have the guys keep tacking them on the way they did," Glavine said.	Jose Reyes homered for the Mets, who bounced back from a 5-4 loss in the first game of the series on Tuesday to win for the 10th time in their last 14 games. All of their starters had at least one	hit as the team finished with a season-high 17.	Glavine (5-2) cruised in winning his third straight start, allowing three runs, four hits and striking out four. Even more impressive was the way the .188 career hitter swung the bat, with a two-run double in the third and a single up the middle in the fifth. He also walked on four pitches with two outs in the sixth.	"If I could hit and have someone be a designated runner, it would be good," he said, smiling.	The two hits gave him as many hits as he allowed to the Phillies at that point. Pat Burrell's two-run homer in the fourth was his only mistake and that only cut the lead to 10-2.	Glavine improved his career record to 280-186.	"I'm just thankful I've stayed healthy to put them all in," he said.	It had been quite a turnaround for the Phillies, who got off to a 1-6 start and finished 10-14 in April. The winning streak began on April 30 with a 5-1 victory in Pittsburgh that avoided a three-game sweep against the woeful Pirates.	"We just have to throw this one out the window and bounce back tomorrow," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said.	Lidle ran into a little bit of bad luck in his two-plus innings. Three of the eight runs he allowed were unearned because of two errors on first baseman Ryan Howard and one of his own.	Two of the errors led to two runs in the first and Paul Lo Duca	added a two-run double in the second to make it 4-0. Then the Mets smashed the game open with a six-run third.	Three straight singles loaded the bases when Howard made a nifty pick of a hard Xavier Nady grounder, only to throw the ball into left field for a two-run error that made it 6-0. That was it for Lidle, who was booed off the mound.	"I couldn't figure out why they were on my pitches," Lidle said. "I thought maybe I was doing something with my glove."	Glavine then doubled in two runs and Reyes hit a two-run drive, his second, to make it 10-0. Glavine and Reyes each singled in the fifth and scored on Carlos Beltran's double.	"That's the way we have to play, come out and be aggressive and make things happen," Mets manager Willie Randolph said.	Howard added a solo shot in the seventh.	The Mets scored their most runs since beating Milwaukee 13-4 on April 13 and the Phillies allowed their most runs since St. Louis scored 13 on Opening Day.	Game notes	Glavine became the 38th pitcher to reach 4,000 career innings on the mound. ... The Phillies plan to call up top pitching prospect Cole Hamels to make his major-league debut Friday against the Cincinnati Reds. The 22-year-old left-hander is 3-1 with a 1.04 ERA in seven minor-league starts this year. He has 65 strikeouts in 43 1/3 innings and opposing batters are hitting just .168 against him. ... Randolph said he will switch the rotation for this weekend's series at Milwaukee. Right-hander Jose Lima will now pitch Friday and right-hander Jeremi Gonzalez will pitch Saturday. ... Right-hander Chris Booker was claimed off outright waivers by Kansas City, which put the Phillies at 38 on their 40-man roster. Booker was selected by the Phillies in the Rule 5 draft. ... The Mets have homered in 14 straight games. ... Lo Duca finished with three RBI.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Jason Bay is all but promising the Pittsburgh	Pirates have bottomed out in a season that couldn't have gone much	worse. Brandon Webb must be wondering how much better it can get	than this.	Webb withstood a shaky start to win his sixth in a row, Chad	Tracy had four hits and Shawn Green drove in three runs to give the	Arizona Diamondbacks a 7-4 victory over the Pirates on Wednesday	night.	Webb gave up three runs and 10 hits despite constantly being in	trouble over six innings, but worked out of enough jams to improve	to 6-0 in eight starts. He has the most victories of any unbeaten	pitcher in the majors, never allowing more than three runs in any	start during his streak.	"Tonight was the most I'd say he's gotten hit all year, and he	still only gave up three runs," Green said. "He's our guy and	we're trying to ride him every time he pitches."	Now come the hard part for the right-handed Webb, who also was	6-0 last season before finishing 14-12. He has a 15-7 record in	April and May during his career, but is 21-30 in other months.	"It definitely feels good to win your first six decisions --	and, hopefully, keep it rolling," Webb said.	So far, the Pirates have been bad no matter the day or month --	they fell to 10-25, 3-6 in May, while settling for a two-run first	against Webb, then leaving the bases loaded and failing to score in	what was shaping up to be a big third inning.	"But we're going to be better than we have been," said Bay,	arguably the Pirates' most talented player and one who seems to be	running out of patience with the losing. "We haven't been that	good and we have to be better."	The Pirates did tie it at 3 in the sixth on the first of Jose	Castillo's two RBI doubles. But Arizona retook the lead -- and made	certain Webb got the decision -- when Green doubled and scored on	Johnny Estrada's run-scoring single in the seventh against Damaso	Marte (0-2).	The Diamondbacks pushed the lead to three runs in the eighth	against Matt Capps on Green's two-run single, which came after	Tracy doubled for his fourth hit. Arizona had 16 hits, but only	three for extra bases.	"We found some holes," Tracy said. "I wouldn't say we hit it	as hard as we'd like to, but they had some eyes on them and that's	the way the ball rolls. If you find some holes, it can change the	whole ballgame."	Arizona, winning its eighth in 10 games, took a 2-0 lead in the	first when Pirates left-hander Paul Maholm allowed five consecutive	runners to reach base. Jackson had a run-scoring single ahead of	Green's sacrifice fly.	Webb had not allowed more than two runs in any of his three most	recent starts, but the Pirates quickly tied it in their half of the	first on consecutive singles by Jose Bautista, Nate McLouth and	Freddy Sanchez, with Sanchez driving in a run, ahead of Bay's	double-play grounder.	Bay, an NL All-Star last year whose average is down to .252,	also left runners on base in what became a pivotal third inning.	After Bautista, McLouth and Sanchez again singled in succession,	Bay struck out and Jeromy Burnitz -- whose average has dipped to	.185 -- flew out to center.	"It wasn't my best game," Bay said.	Nor was it for Burnitz, who failed to run out a seemingly	routine ground ball to second in the eighth inning. Orlando Hudson	mishandled the ball but, because Burnitz wasn't very far down the	line, recovered in time to throw him out.	Asked about Burnitz's lack of hustle, manager Jim Tracy said,	"That wasn't why we lost the game."	Luis Vizcaino pitched a scoreless seventh inning for Arizona	before Brandon Lyon gave up Castillo's RBI double in the eighth.	Jose Valverde pitched the ninth for his 10th save in 11	opportunities.	^Notes:@ Webb has a 2.20 ERA during his winning streak. He is 2-0 in	three career starts against Pittsburgh. ... Green had three more	hits, making him 27-of-58 (.466) during his last 15 games. ... A	night after the Pirates reached .500 at home for the first time	this season, they lost there for the eighth time in 15 games. ...	Maholm gave up 10 hits and three runs in 5 2-3 innings after	yielding two runs in 13 innings in his previous two starts. ...	Arizona had dropped two in a row after winning seven in succession.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.
