DETROIT -- Johnny Damon sent a low pitch over the right-field fence, a sweet stroke the New York Yankees have seen many times.	For the first time, Damon did it against New York as an ex-Yankee.	Damon hit a homer in his first game against the team that didn't re-sign him, helping the Detroit Tigers beat the Yankees 5-4 on Monday night.	"We've all seen him do that a lot," New York manager Joe Girardi said. "Some of the time on our side and some of the time on the other side."	Austin Jackson, a former Yankees prospect, gave Detroit a three-run lead in the second inning, and Phil Coke got two key outs against his former team after Damon's homer.	"Those guys were pumped up," teammate Joel Zumaya said.	Damon, though, insisted he was not motivated to show the Yankees what they're missing.	"I'm not that kind of person," he said.	Damon helped the Yankees win the World Series last year in the final season of his $52 million, four-year deal. He wanted a long-term deal at the same average salary, but the Yankees didn't value him that much and kept reducing their offer, claiming payroll constraints.	"I know forever I'll be linked with the 27th championship," Damon said.	The Yankees took on a bigger salary when they acquired center fielder Curtis Granderson from Detroit in a three-way trade with Arizona, sending prospect Jackson and Coke to Detroit.	At least short term, the deal has been in the Tigers' favor.	Mark Teixeira's two-run home run pulled New York within a run in the third inning, but it blew chances to score more by stranding nine.	"We had chances to come back, but we had some missed opportunities," Girardi said.	Detroit's Brad Thomas gave up two runs in three innings. Eddie Bonine (3-0) pitched 2 1/3 scoreless innings. Zumaya gave up two runs on three hits and two walks after pitching well for 1 2/3 innings.	Coke retired two before Ryan Perry got Derek Jeter to line out to end the eighth with two on and down a run. Jose Valverde struck out the side for his ninth save.	Valverde fanned Nick Swisher, Teixeira and Alex Rodriguez much to the delight of 34,365 fans.	Brennan Boesch hit a two-run single in the first after Rodriguez's two-out throwing error.	"That hurt quite a bit because it moved up two runners and then the next guy gets a base hit and they both scored," New York's starting pitcher Sergio Mitre said. "Alex made a nice diving stop, and if he's able to get off a good throw, we're out of the inning, so that was tough."	Boesch added an RBI triple in the seventh to give the Tigers a 5-2 lead.	Detroit needed the cushion.	The Yankees loaded the bases with no outs against Zumaya in the eighth and former Tiger Marcus Thames hit an infield single to pull within two runs and chase the Detroit reliever. Brett Gardner hit an RBI groundout against Coke and Randy Winn popped out against him.	With the crowd on its feet for a full-count pitch, right fielder Magglio Ordonez made a sliding snag of Jeter's liner near the right-field line.	"It was a game-saver," Detroit manager Jim Leyland said.	Mitre (0-1) gave up four runs -- three earned -- on five hits and two walks over 4 1/3 innings.	Damon -- who signed an $8 million, one-year deal -- hit a solo shot in the fifth to put Detroit ahead 4-2 and chase Mitre.	"Johnny likes playing in big games, so it's not a surprise that he had a big hit," Jeter said. "He's done that for us a lot of times and he's done it against us a lot of times."	Game notes	 Thomas took Dontrelle Willis' spot in the rotation and Leyland hopes Willis can pitch out of the bullpen Tuesday. ... The Tigers have the area's undivided attention in early May for the first time since 2001, when the Red Wings had a first-round exit in the NHL playoffs and the previous year the Pistons weren't in the NBA playoffs. ... The Tigers honored late broadcaster Ernie Harwell during a pregame ceremony. ... Mitre made his first start of the season, filling in for Andy Pettitte, whose elbow is expected to be healthy enough for him to pitch Saturday.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PITTSBURGH -- Bronson Arroyo keeps reminding the Pittsburgh Pirates what they let get away without receiving anything in return. Except a lot of well-pitched games against them.	Arroyo limited Pittsburgh to one run over seven-plus innings in his latest successful start against his former team, Scott Rolen and Laynce Nix doubled in runs and the Cincinnati Reds held off the Pirates to win 2-1 on Monday night.	Arroyo (2-2), trying for his fourth career shutout, permitted only three singles until Ronny Cedeno led off the eighth by homering down the left-field line, his third of the season.	Manager Dusty Baker lifted Arroyo after Delwyn Young followed with a pinch-hit single, but reliever Arthur Rhodes got the next three outs -- striking out Andrew McCutchen to strand Young at second.	Cincinnati scored what proved to be the winning run in the top of the inning, after Pirates third baseman Andy LaRoche committed his fourth error in four games by failing to make a backhanded stop of Joey Votto's grounder. Rolen doubled into the right-center gap off Evan Meek to make it 2-0, helping the Reds win their 10th in 14 games.	"If your pitcher's going out there and is pitching (a lot of) innings and keeps the ball down, you get results," Brandon Phillips said.	Arroyo couldn't have been much sharper, retiring the side in order four times while failing to allow a runner past second base until Cedeno homered. The right-hander struck out two and walked one, throwing 72 of 103 pitches for strikes. He lasted at least six innings for the sixth time in seven starts.	"He can throw from three different angles, he can throw from three-quarters, he can throw from the top -- he can confuse anybody," Cedeno said.	Arroyo won his fourth in his last five decisions against the Pirates, who released him after the 2002 season without bothering to try to trade him. He has won 79 games in the majors since then, including a pair of 15-win seasons and two 14-win seasons.	The one-time Pirates prospect has permitted only three runs in 28 innings during those four victories, which date to midway through the 2008 season.	"He was awesome," Baker said.	He also didn't have nearly as much at his disposal as usual.	"I didn't have the ball moving a whole lot other than my sinker," Arroyo said. "It was going down just enough to get some ground balls. That really helped me out because these guys have seen a lot of soft stuff from me in the past. I really didn't have my soft stuff moving too much, but it worked out."	Francisco Cordero earned his 11th save in 13 opportunities despite walking two in the ninth. He stranded the potential tying run at third by getting Cedeno to ground into a force play.	Cordero blew a save opportunity, and took the loss, by yielding two runs in the ninth inning of the Reds' 5-4 loss in Pittsburgh on April 17. The Pirates swept that three-game series.	Pirates right-hander Ross Ohlendorf (0-1) came off the disabled list to pitch four innings in his second start of the season, giving up three hits and walking four while throwing 84 pitches. Ohlendorf (back spasms) hadn't started since April 7 against the Dodgers, the Pirates' second game.	The Reds' only run off Ohlendorf came in the fourth. Jay Bruce singled and scored on Nix's double, barely beating the relay throw to the plate. In the ninth, Johnny Gomes was thrown out at the plate trying to score on Orlando Cabrera's two-out double.	Game notes	Drew Stubbs is 4-for-16 since being dropped from No. 1 to No. 7 in the order. ... Arroyo fell an inning short of making his ninth start of at least eight innings with no more than one run allowed since the start of last season. ... Left fielder Nix made an excellent running catch of Aki Iwamura's fly ball to left-center in the sixth. ... The Pirates are 10-3 in games decided by no more than two runs.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BOSTON -- The Boston Red Sox kept crossing the plate because Toronto starter Brandon Morrow couldn't find it.	Morrow set a Blue Jays record by walking five batters in one inning as the Red Sox scored four runs in the second and went on to a 7-6 win Monday night.	"I hate walks," Toronto manager Cito Gaston said. "I just absolutely hate them because most of them score, quicker than a base hit. But his next time, hopefully, he can work it out."	The Red Sox needed just one hit in that inning to take the lead, a cushion that came in handy when John Lackey (4-1) struggled through six innings before Hideki Okajima, Daniel Bard and Jonathan Papelbon held the Blue Jays hitless. Papelbon worked the ninth for his ninth save in nine chances.	Boston trailed 4-2 heading into the second and led 6-4 after the wild streak by Morrow (2-3).	"There's something to be said for patience" at the plate, Red Sox manager Terry Francona said. "I know Morrow was having a tough time commanding, but we didn't go out of the zone and we got some runs because of it."	Dustin Pedroia's RBI single made it 7-4 in the third. Jose Bautista hit a two-run homer, his seventh, to cut it to 7-6, but Toronto lost for the second time in nine games. Boston is 6-2 in its last eight.	Morrow, a 25-year-old right-hander in his first full season as a starter, had tied the club record of four walks in an inning on April 9 in his debut with Toronto after being traded by Seattle on Dec. 23 for Brandon League.	In 35 innings this season, Morrow has 26 walks and 46 strikeouts. In his previous two starts, he struck out nine batters each time, a career high. On Monday, he had four strikeouts and allowed three hits in 1 2/3 innings.	"I was just a mess," said Morrow, who has been working on his release point. "That's an embarrassing start to go out there and walk six in not even two innings."	The Red Sox took a 2-0 lead before Morrow recorded an out. Marco Scutaro led off the first with a walk, Pedroia doubled and both scored on Victor Martinez's single. Morrow then struck out the next three batters.	The Blue Jays went ahead with four runs in the second before Lackey retired a batter. They loaded the bases on a walk to Lyle Overbay, a double by Alex Gonzalez and a walk to Bautista. John Buck then doubled in two runs, and Travis Snider and Fred Lewis singled in one each.	"He was really struggling to find his command, " Francona said. "He reeled it in and he competed without his best stuff tonight and got us deep enough where our guys in the bullpen could do their job, and they did it really well."	Lackey's problems were eclipsed by Morrow's meltdown in the bottom of the second.	Boston loaded the bases on walks to Jeremy Hermida, Jonathan Van Every and Scutaro. Pedroia also walked, forcing home a run with one out. Martinez then grounded to shortstop Gonzalez, who threw to second for a forceout. But Aaron Hill's throw to first trying for an inning-ending double play sailed into Boston's dugout for an error as Van Every and Scutaro scored.	The Red Sox then drew their fifth walk of the inning, by Kevin Youkilis, before David Ortiz's RBI single gave them a 6-4 lead, chasing Morrow. Josh Roenicke walked his first batter, Adrian Beltre, bringing the total for the inning to six. But he retired the next batter, ending the second.	The long wait to return to the mound didn't hurt Lackey.	"You'll never hear me complain about runs," he said. "I'll wait all night as long as they want to hit."	Lackey pitched a scoreless third and fourth and retired the first two batters in the fifth before Gonzalez singled and Bautista homered with two outs. But Lackey retired the next batter and finished his night with a perfect sixth.	"It was not real pretty," Gaston said. "We still hung in there and lost by a run, but a loss is a loss."	Game notes	 Boston RF J.D. Drew was a late scratch from the starting lineup with vertigo. ... Josh Beckett's next start was pushed back two days to Friday night in Detroit to give him time to work on his problems. He's allowed at least seven earned runs in three of his last four outings. Tim Wakefield will take his place Wednesday against Toronto. ... With the bases loaded this year, Blue Jays pitchers have issued seven walks and hit two batters with pitches. ... Umpires reviewed Gonzalez's hit near the top of the left-field wall and stuck with their original decision of a double instead of changing it to a homer.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

NEW YORK -- Washington manager Jim Riggleman came into Monday night's matchup against the Mets with a rookie on the mound and his top two relievers in need of a rest.	In past years, that combination usually added up to big trouble. Not for these Nats.	Luis Atilano, on his 25th birthday, pitched admirably into the sixth inning, then a makeshift bullpen held on to give the Nationals a 3-2 victory over New York without closer Matt Capps or setup man Tyler Clippard available.	"He really did a nice job for us. We wanted to get everything we could out of him because we knew we didn't have Clippard and Capps at the other end," Riggleman said. "He gave us a chance and we got it."	Adam Kennedy and Ryan Zimmerman hit consecutive homers and Ivan Rodriguez had an RBI single in the seventh inning among his four hits for Washington, which came in tied with New York for second place in the NL East at 17-14. Kennedy homered to right and Zimmerman to left off John Maine (1-2) in the third.	Atilano (3-0) allowed five hits in 5 1/3 scoreless innings and got his first big league hit to help the Nationals improve to four games over .500 (18-14) for the first time since they were 77-73 on Sept. 19, 2005.	"What happened the last couple of years in Washington is already over," said Rodriguez, in his first year with the Nationals. "This is 2010. We have a team. We're focused now. We play the game now."	Rodriguez's run-scoring single off Pedro Feliciano in the seventh became the deciding run when Miguel Batista gave up a one-out solo homer to Angel Pagan in the ninth. Batista finished for his first save, striking out Jason Bay with a runner on to end it.	The Nationals used five relievers to finish without Clippard, who earned the win in the Nationals' previous three victories, or Capps, who leads the majors with 13 saves.	"There was nothing said down there. There was no rallying cry," Tyler Walker said about the Washington bullpen.	Jose Reyes became the second Mets player ejected for disputing a called third strike in two days. He was tossed by plate umpire Laz Diaz in the seventh after David Wright was booted in the ninth Sunday. New York manager Jerry Manuel was ejected for defending Reyes -- perhaps he was just expressing his frustration at another poor game at the plate for New York.	The Mets followed up 14 strikeouts Sunday with 11 more on Monday, going 1 for 12 with runners in scoring position. They stranded 11 runners overall and lost their second game in a row.	"It's a team concern, no doubt about it," Manuel said. "We will do what we can to address the approach. When situations come, basically breath and enjoy."	New York made two big mistakes on the bases.	With a runner on second, Wright was doubled off first on Ike Davis' popup to third after getting his first hit in 10 at-bats (nine strikeouts). In the seventh, Jeff Francoeur broke from third on Pagan's chopper to the mound and was caught in a rundown. Luis Castillo followed with an RBI single off Doug Slaten, called up from Triple-A on Sunday, that pulled the Mets to 2-1.	Atilano was coming off the worst outing of his young career -- four starts. He admittedly was anxious when he gave up six runs Wednesday to the team that traded him after he had Tommy John surgery in 2006, the Atlanta Braves.	He had no such problems against the slumping Mets, though. Atilano got five of his first six outs by strikeout on Monday.	Two of them came after he loaded the bases on a single and two walks in the first. First, Wright struck out for his seventh straight at-bat for out No. 2. Then, Davis fanned to end the inning.	"I don't know how. I'm not a strikeout kind of guy," said Atilano, whose previous high for strikeouts was four. "But I'll take it."	Atilano did not let a runner reach third after the first.	Maine gave up two runs and six hits in six innings. He walked four and struck out five.	Game notes	 After the game, the Mets designated reserve OF Frank Catalanotto for assignment and recalled OF Chris Carter from Triple-A Buffalo. ... Nationals LHP John Lannan (left elbow discomfort) threw a bullpen session and is expected to make his next scheduled start Thursday. ... Mets C Henry Blanco was placed on the bereavement list so he can be with his ailing mother in Venezuela. The team recalled C Josh Thole from Buffalo to take his place.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

CHICAGO -- There was sympathy all around for Starlin Castro after his miserable home debut, even from the Florida Marlins.	Hanley Ramirez predicted big things for the Chicago Cubs' prized rookie.	"He's going to be fine," the Marlins shortstop said.	Castro was far from it Monday night and his teammates weren't much better.	Nate Robertson pitched six solid innings, Ronny Paulino homered and the Marlins beat the Cubs 4-2 after dropping five of six.	Paulino's two-run homer highlighted a three-run seventh in which Cody Ross stole home, giving the Marlins a 4-2 lead and sending the Cubs to their sixth loss in seven games.	Robertson (3-3) allowed two runs and seven hits after dropping his previous three starts.	Chicago's Ted Lilly (1-3) took a no-hitter into the sixth before things unraveled. Alfonso Soriano had three hits, including two run-scoring singles, and threw out Ramirez trying to score from second on Jorge Cantu's single to left in the eighth.	But it was a rough night for Castro.	After setting a major league record by driving in six runs in his debut at Cincinnati on Friday, he struggled in his first appearance at Wrigley Field. The shortstop committed three errors, giving him four in as many games, and went from hearing loud cheers to loud boos.	Fans really let him have it in the eighth, when he let Ramirez's grounder go under his glove as he tried to backhand it and then took his time retrieving the ball in shallow left, allowing the runner to reach second. Soriano kept it a two-run game with a strong throw home moments later, but the Cubs couldn't pull this one out.	"You have got to get the ball if you don't catch it," manager Lou Piniella said.	Through an interpreter, Castro said that play was simply "a rookie mistake" and dismissed the idea that nerves played a role in the errors. If they did, Soriano could sympathize.	"That's a dream of every baseball player -- to be in the big leagues," said Soriano, who's housing Castro for now. "To be in the big leagues, 20 years old, he can be a little nervous."	Lilly was a tough-luck loser, dropping his third straight start even though he only allowed five hits in seven innings.	The Marlins did not get a hit until Chris Coghlan's RBI double with one out in the sixth, which came after Castro threw high to first on Brett Carroll's leadoff grounder, to tie it at 1.	The Cubs took the lead in the bottom half when Aramis Ramirez's wind-blown pop drifted toward the middle of the infield and eluded first baseman Gaby Sanchez, dropping in for a single. After a wild pitch, he scored from second on Soriano's single to left, but Lilly couldn't hold the lead.	He gave up a single to Dan Uggla with one out in the eighth before Paulino drove a slider off the basket in left field for his second homer, pointing toward the sky as he rounded first. The Marlins got another run on a double steal, when Lilly tried to pick off Cameron Maybin at first and Ross raced home to make it 4-2 in a close play.	"I made sure as soon as he looked at his leg, I just took off and Cam did a great job of getting off far enough," Ross said. "He threw over there, and [Derrick Lee] made a really good play. It was a lot closer than I anticipated."	Leo Nunez worked the ninth for his sixth save in eight chances.	For the Cubs, it was simply another frustrating night.	"Hopefully, losing will bother us enough to do something about it," Lilly said.	Game notes	 The Marlins activated LHP Dan Meyer, who had been on the 15-day disabled list since April 26 because of a strained left calf. ... Soriano has a nine-game hitting streak. ... Piniella said LHP John Grabow was "ready to go" after getting a cortisone shot for his sore left knee. ... The Cubs will give their starters an extra day of rest rather than juggle their rotation with an off day Thursday. ... There was a moment of silence before the game for Hall of Fame pitcher Robin Roberts and broadcaster Ernie Harwell, who both died last week. ... Butler coach Brad Stevens threw out the first pitch and led the seventh-inning rendition of "Take Me Out to the Ballgame."

MILWAUKEE -- The Atlanta Braves provided some much-needed power behind Tommy Hanson. Now, they believe their slow start may be ending.	Martin Prado hit a grand slam, Hanson struck out eight in eight scoreless innings and the scuffling Braves snapped a power drought in an 8-2 win over the Milwaukee Brewers on Monday night.	"We know that all the things that are happening right now for us are going to turn around," Prado said. "This kind of game is what we need to start something good."	Atlanta had gone 253 games without a grand slam before Prado's in the sixth. The Braves had also gone four days without a homer before Troy Glaus led off the inning with a shot off Brewers starter Doug Davis (1-4).	"We felt relieved after that," Prado said of Glaus' shot. "Tommy Hanson was great, but we knew we needed a couple of runs to support him."	So they gave him six in the inning.	After Glaus' homer and a fielding error by second baseman Rickie Weeks that let another run score, Davis walked the bases loaded with two outs. Prado, who had a career-high five RBIs, then hit reliever Manny Parra's fastball into the left-field bleachers.	"It's part of the game, everybody makes errors," Prado said. "After that, we had a pretty idea of where we were going."	Hanson (3-2) said he "didn't feel tired one bit" and would've been willing to try to complete the game after scattering four hits and being staked a big lead.	"It's always easier to pitch when you have some run support," the promising right-hander said. "It's definitely a good win for us."	Atlanta led 7-0 despite just five hits through the sixth and finished with seven hits, but it qualified as an offensive outburst for the Braves, who featured seven hitters in their lineup batting .252 or lower entering the night and three regulars at .192 or less.	Glaus' homer to start the sixth was Atlanta's first in a span of 169 at-bats. It would get even better with Prado's first career slam and the Braves' first since July 25, 2008.	"It was a pretty good pitcher's duel going there until the sixth inning," Brewers manager Ken Macha said. "That's when it kind of unraveled."	Hanson mixed his mid-90s fastball with a sharp slider that kept the majors' highest-scoring team coming into Monday quiet until Casey McGehee's two-run homer off reliever Jesse Chavez in the ninth.	Hanson's biggest trouble came in the fourth after he hit Ryan Braun with a fastball with one out and Prince Fielder's pop up to shallow left field dropped between three Braves.	But Hanson froze McGehee on an 84 mph breaking ball that buckled the third baseman's knees and left fielder Matt Diaz made a nice leaping grab of Jim Edmonds' drive to the warning track that saved at least a run. Braun left before the seventh with a bruised left elbow and is day-to-day.	Davis was wild, walking six batters and hitting another. Prado's RBI single in the fifth was the first hit Davis allowed after a leadoff walk in the inning came back to haunt the left-hander.	"I'm puzzled," Davis said. "But I believe everything evens out, too."	Atlanta is still missing regulars Jason Heyward (groin) and shortstop Yunel Escobar (groin). Chipper Jones (groin) returned to the lineup, going 1 for 3 with a walk before leaving for a pinch runner in the sixth.	Jones had hustled down the line for an infield single before exiting. Cox said he wasn't sure if Jones would be available Tuesday after he was limping from the effort.	"I don't think it's any worse, to be honest," Jones said.	Game notes	 Heyward is expected to return Tuesday. ... Braves RHP Jair Jurrjens (hamstring) said he heard a pop while sprinting and will have an MRI back in Atlanta when the Braves return after this series. ... Brewers CF Carlos Gomez (strained left rotator cuff) was put on the 15-day DL after the game, retroactive to May 6. OF Adam Stern was called up from Triple-A Nashville. ... Brewers RHP David Riske will begin a rehab assignment at Single-A Brevard County on Tuesday.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

DENVER -- Meltdowns on the mound, errors in the outfield, replacements up and down the roster -- not exactly the ingredients for good baseball.	Against the Philadelphia Phillies, it's a recipe for an ugly defeat.	"We're just totally out of sync," Jason Giambi said after Colorado blew two leads on the way to a 9-5 loss Monday night. "We [normally] play great defense, we move the runners along."	Not on this night.	"If you give those guys more than 27 outs, they're going to beat you every single time," Giambi said.	Carlos Ruiz had four hits, including a homer in the sixth inning and a tiebreaking single off Manny Corpas in the ninth, and Shane Victorino tripled twice, drew three walks and scored three runs.	Ruiz's third single scored Ryan Howard from second. Howard was plunked by an 0-2 fastball from Corpas leading off the ninth and went to second one out later on a wild pitch by Corpas.	Pinch-hitter Ross Gload then sent a 3-1 delivery from Corpas into the bullpen beyond the right-field wall for a three-run homer that made it 9-5 and sent the shivering crowd streaming to the exits.	The four-run rally off Corpas (1-2) made a winner of Danys Baez (1-1), who threw a scoreless eighth. Jose Contreras got the final three outs.	The ninth-inning meltdown, shaky defense and poor pitching ruined a breakout game for Giambi, who had three hits, three RBIs and narrowly missed homering twice.	Giambi made the most of a rare start at first base, driving in three runs with two singles and a sacrifice fly before doubling off the wall in the ninth.	He entered just 2 for 22, but Rockies manager Jim Tracy noted that most of those at-bats came sporadically and against some of the game's top closers. In an impassioned defense of his backup first baseman before the game, Tracy said he had faith in the 38-year-old veteran.	"Knowing the reputation and the résumé of the player, he's one swing away from being hotter than hell," Tracy declared.	That swing came in the first inning when Giambi, batting cleanup, lined a pitch from right-hander Kyle Kendrick into right field for an RBI single.	"Hopefully this will kind of jump-start me a little bit," said Giambi, who added a sacrifice fly in the third and a broken-bat bloop single off lefty J.C. Romero in the seventh that erased a 5-4 deficit.	David Herndon then came in and rescued the Phillies with the help of second baseman Chase Utley, who snared Melvin Mora's grounder up the middle to save a run and start an inning-ending double play.	"That's how Utley plays," his manager, Charlie Manuel, said. "Utley is a hard player. He will make big plays at the right time."	And Ruiz is starting to collect big, timely hits -- he said he's simply learned to chill out in stressful situations.	"The last couple of years I was fighting myself. This year Charlie got me to relax and you see what has happened," Ruiz said.	Tracy had to juggle his lineup with shortstop Troy Tulowitzki (quadriceps) hurt, outfielder Carlos Gonzalez out of the country to attend a funeral and slumping slugger Todd Helton getting the night off.	Rockies left-hander Greg Smith induced a potential double-play grounder from Howard in the fifth. But Mora, playing second base with Clint Barmes at shortstop, dropped the flip from Barmes after getting the force.	Jayson Werth followed with a double down the left-field line and Howard scored an unearned run from first when Seth Smith let the ball scoot under his glove for an error, putting the Phillies ahead 3-2.	Brad Hawpe also made an error in right, and Matt Daley's wild pitch sent Victorino sprinting home to put the Phillies ahead 5-4 in the sixth.	Game notes	 Injured Colorado closer Huston Street threw a bullpen session. LHP Jeff Francis will have his second rehab start at Double-A Tulsa on Tuesday night.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- In the end, the Los Angeles Angels' seven-man bullpen worked out much better than the Tampa Bay Rays' five-man infield.	Juan Rivera's sacrifice fly in the 11th inning gave the Angels a 5-4 victory Monday night over the team with baseball's best record after closer Brian Fuentes blew a three-run lead in the ninth.	Torii Hunter and Mike Napoli homered, and Trevor Bell (1-0) struck out the only batter he faced in his season debut after getting called up from Triple-A Salt Lake earlier in the day. Manager Mike Scioscia said before the game he needed an extra pitcher because of an overworked bullpen, and the timing was perfect.	"It started at 6 a.m. in Fresno and ended pretty good," said Bell, who was notified of his promotion the night before. "I had to get to the airport pretty early because my flight was at 8. I got to town around 10 o'clock, drove home to see my parents in Burbank and made a 50-minute drive down here. Luckily, I didn't catch any traffic today. It was intense, but it was fun."	Kendry Morales led off the 11th with a single against Grant Balfour (0-1), advanced on Reggie Willits' bunt and took third on a wild pitch. Manager Joe Maddon then went to a five-man infield, adding outfielder Ben Zobrist to the mix, but Rivera flied to center and Morales scored after the catch by Gabe Kapler.	It was the second time this season that Maddon used the unorthodox defensive alignment. The other time, it worked.	The ending was a shot in the arm for the three-time defending AL West champions, who were coming off a 2-8 road trip that was their worst since 2001.	"That felt good," Hunter said. "It was good to get away from that road trip. That was a disaster. We'd like to apologize to the fans, to the front office and everybody because of the way we played. It was terrible. But we won two out of three in Seattle and kind of built off of it."	The Rays, who had a perfect game pitched against them by Oakland's Dallas Braden on Sunday, were held to five hits by Joel Pineiro through the first 6 1/3 innings and trailed 4-0 heading into the eighth.	But John Jaso triggered their comeback with a two-out RBI single against Fernando Rodney, and the Rays got three more in the ninth against Fuentes, whose blown save was his second in six chances.	"We never feel like we're out of a game," Maddon said. "I know we've been struggling at the plate a bit, but this game causes those kind of moments and you just have to battle through them."	After Willy Aybar homered with one out, Jason Bartlett beat out an infield single to the right of second base, Zobrist walked with two outs, and Evan Longoria drove Fuentes' next pitch to the fence in left-center to score both runners. It was his first career at-bat against the four-time All-Star, who led the majors last season with a career-high 48 saves.	"It wasn't a bad pitch in my mind," Fuentes said. "It was a first-pitch changeup and he went out and got it. But it was really the walk that hurt me the most. But we won, so that's some relief."	Tampa Bay's Matt Garza allowed four runs and seven hits over 7 2/3 innings, struck out six and was lifted after walking Hideki Matsui with his 117th pitch.	Zobrist singled with two outs in the first, ending a string of 37 consecutive Tampa Bay batters retired -- including the final eight Saturday. That's the second-longest drought by any losing team in the last 14 perfect games pitched in the majors since 1923. When Mike Witt pitched his perfect game for the Angels on the final day of the 1984 season at Texas, the final 11 Rangers batters were retired the night before.	"We were just relieved and happy that somebody got a hit," Carl Crawford said. "Coming off a game like that, it was nice to break that cycle real quick so that we could concentrate on this game more."	Tampa Bay had allowed only one home run in a span of 95 innings entering the game. But Hunter homered in the third, and Napoli increased the Angels' margin to 4-0 in the fourth after a leadoff single by Howie Kendrick.	Game notes	 The Rays played without center fielder B.J. Upton, who was in St. Petersburg for the birth of his son. ... The Angels are scheduled to face Braden either Saturday or Sunday at Anaheim. According to research by the Elias Sports Bureau, the only other pitchers to face the Angels in their first start following a no-hitter were Boston's Dave Morehead on Sept. 22, 1965, and Oakland's Vida Blue on Sept. 26, 1970. Morehead allowed his first four batters to reach base and retired only two of the nine he faced in a 10-1 loss to Dean Chance at Dodger Stadium. Blue squared off against Rudy May, retiring his first seven batters and pitching four innings (one run, three hits) in the Athletics' 4-3 win at Anaheim.

Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

BALTIMORE -- Cliff Lee looked every bit like a Cy Young Award winner in his first victory with the Seattle Mariners.	Then again, the Baltimore Orioles have a way of making almost every starting pitcher look good.	Lee gave up one run before leaving in the eighth inning, Ryan Langerhans homered and the Mariners cruised past the punchless Orioles 5-1 on Tuesday night in a matchup of last-place teams.	After giving up three players last December to get Lee from the Philadelphia Phillies, the Mariners figured it was only a matter of time before the 2008 Cy Young winner started to dominate the AL again.	Consider it done.	Lee (1-1) allowed eight hits, struck out two and walked none in 7 1/3 innings. It was his third start since coming off the disabled list with an abdominal strain.	"Since I've been back, I've felt good," he said. "I've given the team a chance each time I've taken the mound. That's really all you can do a starter. So far, it's gone pretty good."	Opposing pitchers have gone seven or more innings in 20 of Baltimore's 33 games this season. Add Lee to that expanding list.	"We have faced good pitchers, but no excuses," Orioles left fielder Nolan Reimold said. "In the big leagues, you have to do a job and get hits."	Lee, however, is better than most.	"He didn't give in. You look at all great pitchers, and they don't give in," Seattle manager Don Wakamatsu said. "His concentration and intensity is off the chart."	After Lee allowed two consecutive singles in the eighth, Brandon League got Miguel Tejada to hit into a double play. League also pitched the ninth to earn his first save for the Mariners, who have won two straight following an eight-game skid. Seattle is 4-0 against Baltimore and 9-19 against everyone else.	Facing the Orioles for the first time since 2005, Lee dominated a struggling offense that now has scored only two runs over the last 28 innings.	"He was outstanding from the get-go," Baltimore's Ty Wigginton said. "He was using both sides of the plate. He's got a Cy Young for a reason and he showed it tonight."	David Hernandez (0-5) gave up five runs, five hits and four walks in 5 2/3 innings. He has lost 11 straight decisions, the longest active streak in the majors and two short of the Orioles record held by Mike Boddicker (1987-88).	During Hernandez's seven starts this year, Baltimore has scored only six runs while he was in the game.	"I think he probably feels like he's got to go out there and throw a shutout, and you can't blame him for that," Orioles manager Dave Trembley said.	Held hitless through three innings, the Orioles used a single by Nick Markakis and a double by Tejada to put runners in scoring position in the fourth. Lee subsequently struck out Wigginton and retired Matt Wieters on a grounder.	"That's when you've got to bear down," Lee said.	"Lee just amped his game up right there," Trembley said. "He got better."	Langerhans broke the scoreless duel by leading off the fifth with his first home run. The Mariners then loaded the bases with two outs, and Hernandez walked Chone Figgins on a 3-2 pitch before Franklin Gutierrez flied out to center.	Seattle chased Hernandez during a three-run sixth. After retiring the first two batters, Hernandez walked two and gave up an RBI single to Rob Johnson. Another run scored when Reimold fumbled the ball, and Michael Saunders greeted Jason Berken with a run-scoring single.	Baltimore got a run in the seventh when Wigginton doubled and scored on a single by Garrett Atkins.	Game notes	 An intermittent rain fell for much of the night but never stopped play. ... Hernandez has issued 15 walks over the last 15 2/3 innings. Lee, in contrast, has not given up a walk this year. ... Lee is 4-0 in his career against Baltimore. ... Mariners left-hander Erik Bedard (shoulder) was supposed to pitch a simulated game, but rain pushed it back for at least a day. ... Seattle outfielder Ichiro Suzuki was 2-for-4. He's a lifetime .390 hitter at Camden Yards.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

BOSTON -- Daisuke Matsuzaka avoided the one bad inning that plagued him in his last two starts and pitched one of the best games of his career.	Matsuzaka allowed three hits and no walks while striking out nine and the Boston Red Sox capitalized on more wildness by Toronto Blue Jays pitchers for a 6-1 win Tuesday night.	In his first start this season, he allowed six runs in his last inning. In his second, he gave up four runs in his first inning.	"After that tough beginning to the game last time, I tried to keep things simple and I thought that things improved," Matsuzaka said through a translator. "I just wanted to keep that going, so from my first pitch tonight I treated it as a continuation of the last game."	Matsuzaka (2-1) put just three runners on base, the second-lowest total in his 76 career games. The outing was the longest in which he allowed three runners or less.	"He held it together from [inning] one to seven," manager Terry Francona said. "All but those two innings have been pretty good."	Boston won its third straight game and went two games over .500 for the first time this year.	In Matsuzaka's debut on May 1 after starting the year on the disabled list with a strained neck, he gave up one run and one hit in the first four innings and then allowed six runs in the fifth and took the loss. Last Thursday in an 11-6 win over the Los Angeles Angels, he allowed four runs in the first but just one run and three hits in the next 4 1/3 innings and got the victory.	"He was aggressive and confident in his fastball," Francona said, "and it showed."	The only runners reached on a single and double by John Buck and a double by Fred Lewis. He walked none, while four Toronto pitchers issued eight bases on balls one night after the Red Sox drew seven walks in a 7-6 win.	Dana Eveland (3-2) gave up all of Boston's runs in four-plus innings, when he allowed five hits and four walks and hit a batter.	"I really only gave up two hard-hit balls," he said, "but you mix those in with some walks and a couple of balls that hit the chalk and stuff like that, you're going to get beat and that's what happened."	Boston, which won its third straight, took a 2-0 lead in the first when Marco Scutaro led off with a walk, and took third on Dustin Pedroia's ground-rule double. Scutaro scored on J.D. Drew's groundout to first and Pedroia came in on Kevin Youkilis' sacrifice fly. Jason Varitek's sixth homer made it 3-0 in the second.	The Red Sox took advantage of two botched plays to score a run in the fourth.	Varitek singled when his grounder went through the legs of Jose Bautista as the top half of the broken bat flew at the third baseman. Bill Hall then lofted a high fly to short center field that left fielder Lewis, center fielder Vernon Wells and shortstop Alex Gonzalez let fall between them. Wells picked the ball up with a good chance to throw to second for a forceout on Varitek, but threw wildly. He originally was given an error on the throw before an official scoring change made it a hit.	Darnell McDonald then doubled in Varitek.	"We usually play pretty good defense," Toronto manager Cito Gaston said. "I don't know if it's the cold weather or whatever, but it's something that's going to happen over the course of 162 ballgames. I just hope it doesn't happen too often."	In the fifth, Boston capitalized on more errant tosses to score twice and make it 6-0. Drew reached on a bunt single and Youkilis walked. Shawn Camp replaced Eveland and walked Mike Lowell, loading the bases. Drew scored on a wild pitch and Varitek was walked intentionally, reloading the bases. Youkilis scored when Hall grounded into a forceout at second.	Toronto finally broke through against Matsuzaka with a run in the sixth. Buck doubled, took third on a wild pitch and scored on a double by Lewis.	Matsuzaka had retired his first seven batters, three on strikeouts. Buck then singled in the third, but Matsuzaka ended the inning by striking out Travis Snider and Lewis.	He followed with two more perfect innings before giving up the run in the sixth. But he finished his outing with a perfect seventh on two infield popups and a ground out.	Game notes	 Matsuzaka walked no batters for only the second time in his last 33 starts. ... Toronto lost the first two games of the series after going 7-1 in its previous eight. ... Boston is 5-0 against Toronto this season. ... Lewis extended his hitting streak to eight games. ... Boston RHP Josh Beckett is expected to miss Friday's start because of back spasms. ... Eveland is 0-3 with a 17.08 ERA in his career against Boston.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

NEW YORK -- "The Animal" came off the bench to cap a stirring comeback by the New York Mets.	Pinch-hitter Chris Carter, just called up from the minors, delivered a tiebreaking double in his first at-bat for the Mets and New York scored six runs in the eighth inning to rally past the Washington Nationals 8-6 on Tuesday night.	"It's a great feeling. It's really special," Carter said. "I definitely felt like part of the team right there."	Jason Bay and David Wright led the charge, lifting New York out of its recent offensive doldrums with three hits apiece. Four relievers combined for 4 2-3 scoreless innings as the Mets climbed out of a 6-1 hole following a poor start by Jonathon Niese.	The go-ahead hit was provided by Carter, nicknamed "The Animal" by manager Jerry Manuel in spring training for his intensity and work ethic.	"Sounds good to me," Carter said.	Raul Valdes (1-0) worked the eighth for his first major league win and Francisco Rodriguez got three quick outs for his fifth save.	Rookie first baseman Ike Davis turned in a spectacular catch on a game-ending foulout, tumbling into the New York dugout to make a dangerous grab for the second time in five days.	"It's not that far of a drop," Davis said. "I'd rather end the game than worry about getting a bruise."	Jeff Francoeur drove in two runs and Hisanori Takahashi provided another stellar effort in long relief, tossing two shutout innings.	New York was down by four when Bay opened the eighth with a single off Brian Bruney. Wright followed with his second double and Davis hit an RBI grounder that shortstop Ian Desmond threw away for an error.	Tyler Clippard (6-1) struck out Francoeur, but Rod Barajas hit a two-run double high off the left-field fence that barely missed being a tying homer.	"I just didn't get it done after that," Clippard said. "It hurts."	Alex Cora dropped down a perfect bunt single and the Mets were in business, trailing 6-5 with runners at the corners and one out. Angel Pagan tied it with a single and Carter yanked a changeup down the right-field line, pumping his fist as he pulled into second base with the first extra-base hit of his career.	"These guys are some tremendous fighters," Manuel said.	During a postgame interview, Carter took a cream pie in the face from his new teammates.	Acquired from Boston last season as a player to be named in the trade that sent reliever Billy Wagner to the Red Sox, Carter had a strong spring for the Mets but did not make the opening-day roster.	He was called up from Triple-A Buffalo, where he was hitting .336 with six homers and 22 RBIs, when New York designated reserve outfielder Frank Catalanotto for assignment after Monday night's loss.	"I think he had a bat ever since the third inning," Manuel said. "He's a very focused individual. We all feel he can add some spice to our lineup."	Bay drew a bases-loaded walk from Miguel Batista, making it 8-6.	Davis hit a drive deep into the second deck in right and was surprised when it was called foul, crouching to the ground and raising his hands in disbelief. But umpires upheld the ruling after a video review, and Davis said they got the call right after he saw a replay himself.	"I might have shown too much emotion there," Davis said.	Bay also contributed a big play in the field -- his running catch of Nyjer Morgan's bases-loaded drive to left-center ended the fifth with the score 6-1.	Adam Dunn hit a three-run homer and Ivan Rodriguez had a two-run single for the Nationals, who had won three straight. They also had been 14-0 when leading after seven innings.	"They've been lights-out all year. This kind of stuff happens," Dunn said. "It's bound to happen and it's just kind of a shame it happened tonight."	Washington starter Scott Olsen shook off a line drive that hit him on the left ankle in the second inning, then was lifted in the sixth with a five-run cushion. It was another solid outing by the left-hander, who took a no-hitter into the eighth inning of his previous start against Atlanta.	Game notes	 Mets CF Carlos Beltran (knee surgery) has started limited baseball activities, such as swinging a bat and light jogging, at the team's complex in Florida. 1B Daniel Murphy (sprained right knee) is playing in extended spring training games and reliever Ryota Igarashi (left hamstring) is throwing bullpens, club spokesman Jay Horwitz said. ... Nationals manager Jim Riggleman said LHP John Lannan (left elbow discomfort) will be limited to 100 pitches when he returns to the rotation Thursday night at Colorado.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- Daric Barton had nothing to show for his first five at-bats despite some solid swings for the Oakland Athletics. He surely came through in extra innings.	Barton hit a two-out RBI single in the 13th inning after homering in the 11th, and the A's beat the Texas Rangers 7-6 on Tuesday night in the opener of a three-game series between the AL West's top teams.	"I squared a bunch of balls up, just hit them at people," Barton said. "Fortunately in the 11th, (the pitcher) left one over the plate and I took advantage of it. Again in the 13th, it was a 3-2 changeup, I was out in front but got the barrel of the bat on it. Overall, I was happy with my day."	Catcher Landon Powell drew a walk against Dustin Nippert (1-3) to start the Oakland 13th, then swiped second for his first career steal. He scored when Barton's hard grounder short-hopped off second baseman Ian Kinsler's glove and into right field.	"It was one of those games where whoever came out on top was going to feel pretty good and the other team's going to think about it for a while," manager Bob Geren said. "We've seem to have a ton of games like that against Texas, especially in this ballpark."	Oakland won for the fifth time in six games, ending Texas' four-game winning streak and matching the Rangers for the division lead at 18-15.	Barton was 0 for 5 before his two-out solo homer. But Texas tied it in the bottom half of the 11th when David Murphy hit a leadoff single and scored on Julio Borbon's base hit.	Tyson Ross (1-0), the sixth Oakland reliever, pitched the final three innings. He even batted, striking out to end the 12th because the A's had lost their designated hitter in a flurry of substitutions in the ninth.	"Hitting, that was terrible, maybe first time since high school," Ross said. "We got the win and that's all that matters. Everyone did something to contribute. I was throwing pretty good out there and was going to keep pitching."	The A's were back on the field for the first time since Dallas Braden's perfect game on Sunday. There were plenty of mistakes in this one, especially with the closers for both teams blowing leads in the ninth.	Rangers pinch-runner Andres Blanco was cut down at the plate for the final out of the 12th. Blanco tried to score from first when Kinsler's single took an awkward bounce away from right fielder Ryan Sweeney. But his throw to second baseman Adam Rosales and the double-clutch relay to Powell was still in plenty of time.	"Both teams fought hard, it was tough to come out on the losing end of this one," Murphy said.	Eric Chavez hit his first homer for Oakland in nearly two years, a two-run shot in the fifth that tied it at 2. Chavez also singled and scored in the seventh, and helped the A's rally in the ninth.	Chavez reached on shortstop Elvis Andrus' error leading off the ninth and was replaced by Gabe Gross.	Rangers rookie Neftali Feliz entered with Gross on third, one out and a 4-3 lead. Feliz had retired 17 of his previous 18 batters, but he hit Jake Fox before giving up three consecutive singles. Powell's single tied it and Cliff Pennington put Oakland in the lead.	The A's then turned to Andrew Bailey, who had converted 27 consecutive save chances and had a career-best scoreless streak of 21 2/3 innings since last September.	But the right-hander issued a four-pitch walk to rookie Justin Smoak. Pinch-runner Craig Gentry then came in, moving up on a sacrifice and a comebacker to the mound before scoring on a single by Andrus.	Chavez had put the A's up 3-2 when he led off the seventh with a single and scored on Eric Patterson's triple that clipped off right fielder Murphy's glove and rolled to the warning track.	Chavez's homer was his first since June 17, 2008, though that was only a stretch of 42 games for the six-time Gold Glove-winning third baseman who is now primarily a designated hitter. Chavez has been limited to only 58 games -- 27 this season -- while having surgery five times (two back and three shoulder) since September 2007.	Texas regained the lead on Josh Hamilton's two-run homer, a long drive to right-center in the eighth.	Michael Young had an RBI single for Texas in the third and Murphy hit a solo homer an inning later.	Game notes	 Rangers starter Colby Lewis retired the first 12 batters before Kevin Kouzmanoff singled leading off the fifth and Chavez followed with his homer that barely cleared the wall in center. ... Lewis, who pitched seven innings, struck out five, matching Tampa Bay's James Shields for the AL lead with 49. ... Bailey hadn't allowed a run in his first 12 games this season, the 11 2/3 innings the most among relievers without allowing a run. ... The only longer homerless streak for Chavez was 44 games -- the first 44 games of his career.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CHICAGO -- Lou Piniella was left bewildered, wondering how another pitcher coasted through the Chicago Cubs' lineup.	Ricky Nolasco pitched seven sharp innings, and Cody Ross and Gaby Sanchez homered as the Florida Marlins defeated the Chicago Cubs 3-2 on Tuesday night. Nolasco (3-2), a former Cubs farmhand, allowed one run on five hits for the Marlins, who have won two straight after losing five of their six previous games.	"We hit a few balls hard," Piniella said. "We had a chance in the eighth inning, a big chance ... I don't know, I think I'm going to go to a casino in Indiana and play snake eyes. I don't know what else to say, I'll be honest with you.	"Look, one of these days we'll start swinging the bats, that's all I can say."	Chicago lost for the seventh time in eight games and tied a season high with its fourth straight loss. Nolasco, who was traded for Juan Pierre in 2005, was a big reason as he struck out three and walked one.	"I just try to get ahead of these guys," Nolasco said. "They're an aggressive team, so I just kept the ball down and got ahead. The three-run lead was big, so I could just go out there and go after guys. We played great defense tonight. It's big for us to win two in a row right now. We need it. I thought we played a good game today, a good team effort, just like yesterday. Let's just hope this gets us on a run."	Leo Nunez pitched a perfect ninth for his seventh save in nine opportunities as the Marlins try for their first three-game sweep of the season Wednesday.	"Now we have an opportunity to extend the winning streak," Marlins manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "I don't think we've won three straight all year. We're off to a good start, we've got (Chris) Volstad going for us tomorrow."	Cubs starter Randy Wells (3-2) pitched eight strong innings, allowing three runs on four hits. He struck out eight and walked one.	Highly touted Cubs shortstop Starlin Castro, who was called up Friday, committed his fourth error in two days and fifth of the season on pinch-hitter Wes Helm's grounder in the eighth inning.	Despite the defensive struggles for the rookie, Piniella said Castro will back in the starting lineup Wednesday.	In his last start, Wells allowed six earned runs on five hits in the shortest outing of his career in an 11-1 loss to Pittsburgh on Thursday and he didn't fare much better early against the Marlins. In the second inning, Wells walked Dan Uggla, and with two outs, Ross hit Wells' 1-2 pitch into the left-field bleachers. It was Ross' second of the season.	With two outs in the third, Sanchez smacked Wells' 2-1 pitch into bleachers for his third of the season to make it 3-0.	The Marlins and reliever Chris Leroux overcame a scare in the eighth inning. Leroux walked Kosuke Fukudome with one out. Ryan Theriot moved Fukudome to third on a single to right, and Marlon Byrd's sacrifice fly made it 3-2.	Derrek Lee followed with a double to left, but Theriot was wisely held up at third. Leroux limited the damage by striking out Aramis Ramirez on a high fastball to end Chicago's threat.	"Obviously, it's not the ideal situation to be in so I'm just glad I got out of that and we won," Leroux said. "Striking that guy out and keeping us in the lead that's what I was in there for."	Piniella didn't have much to add regarding Ramirez's struggles as his batting average dropped to .159.	"He's been clutch in the past, he really has," Piniella said. "It's been a struggle for him this year, obviously, just keep playing. What can I say?"	Lee, who was dropped from the third spot in the order to the fourth, doubled to right after Ross misjudged the ball on the warning-track and scored Byrd from first in the sixth inning to make it 3-1.	"Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I think it's just a philosophy," Lee said. "I'm more of a believer being stable, but Lou likes to change, that's what he likes to do."	Game notes	 Marlins CF Cameron Maybin made a nice running catch into the ivy-covered brick wall to rob Geovany Soto of extra bases in the fifth. Maybin was holding his left wrist after the catch, but stayed in the game after getting it looked at by the team trainer. ... The Marlins won their first road series since April 13 at Philadelphia.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MILWAUKEE -- Say this much for the Milwaukee Brewers: They've been very gracious hosts this year.	The light-hitting Atlanta Braves come to town, and the Brewers -- owners of the league's worst home record -- make their offense look unstoppable.	Troy Glaus homered for the second straight night, Eric Hinske drove in three runs and the Braves pounded out a season-high 16 hits in an 11-3 victory over the Brewers on Tuesday.	"That's fun to get that many runs," Braves manager Bobby Cox said. "Relax a little bit once in a while."	It wasn't fun or relaxing for the Brewers, who slipped to 4-10 at Miller Park. After Atlanta's 8-2 victory Monday, the Braves go for the sweep on Wednesday afternoon.	Two more sluggish outings at home came as a surprise to Brewers starter Dave Bush (1-3), who thought the team was beginning to hit its stride after road series wins at Los Angeles and Arizona.	"I would say it's disappointing overall to come back home and lose a couple bad games," Bush said. "I think we all felt like we had a little more momentum going, that we had figured things out a little bit."	The offensive outbursts couldn't come soon enough for a Braves team that is already feeling some pressure after a slow start to the season.	"We know it's now, the time is now," Hinske said. "We have got to do something to turn it around, and I think these last two games are a good indicator of what is hopefully to come. This is momentum for us. This is feel-good. We all kind of take a deep breath and [say], 'OK, we're fine.'"	Braves starter Tim Hudson (3-1) kept pitching his way out of trouble and came inches shy of hitting a home run himself in the fifth inning. He didn't think it had a chance at first, but the ball bounced off the top of the wall for a double.	"I remembered what stadium I was in, and I was thinking, 'Man, it might have a chance,'" Hudson said. "Then I saw it hit the top of the wall and bounce in."	Hudson (3-1) allowed a run and six hits in six innings, tying a career high with six walks. He got out of bases-loaded situations in the second and third.	"Hudson knows what he's doing out there," Brewers manager Ken Macha said. "He's not going to give in to you."	Hudson said there "wasn't a whole lot working" for him on the mound but he managed to gut it out.	"It wasn't exactly how I drew it up, but nights like tonight for me are more satisfying than the nights when I go out there with great stuff and it's easy," Hudson said. "It wasn't easy tonight."	Milwaukee was without slugger Ryan Braun, who was hit on the left elbow by a pitch in Monday night's loss and is day to day. Third baseman Chipper Jones was a late scratch from the Braves' lineup because of a sore groin, and Cox said he may not play Wednesday.	Alcides Escobar had two hits and an RBI for Milwaukee, snapping an 0-for-17 skid.	Bush, meanwhile, didn't see anything wrong with Atlanta's offense.	"You see a team put up almost 20 runs in two games, I would say they're all right," Bush said. "We haven't seen them before so I'm not really sure what they've been struggling with, but I would say it's pretty clear the last couple days they've done a little bit of everything offensively."	Bush gave up three runs and seven hits in six innings, and the Brewers' bullpen fell apart after that.	Trailing 6-1, the Brewers pushed across two runs in the seventh, but Escobar lined out with runners on second and third to end the inning. Jones' replacement, Brooks Conrad, homered leading off the eighth and the Braves would go on to score four runs in the inning.	Given some short outings by Milwaukee's starters this season, is the Brewers' bullpen overworked?	"Once in a while, it'd be nice to give everybody a day off back there, but that has not been the case," Macha said.	Game notes	 The Brewers promoted left-hander Chris Capuano to Triple-A Nashville as he continues to make progress in his recovery from his second Tommy John elbow surgery. ... The Braves announced they will retire Tom Glavine's No. 47 and induct the left-hander into team's Hall of Fame. ... Milwaukee reliever Carlos Villanueva hit Brian McCann with a pitch in the eighth.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

MINNEAPOLIS -- Bobby Jenks needed a bounce-back game and the Chicago White Sox offense needed to break out.	They both did just that in the most unlikely of places -- Minnesota.	Target Field proved to be a breath of fresh air for the White Sox, who got a save from the shaky Jenks and the biggest inning of the season from their slumping offense in a 5-2 victory over the Twins on Tuesday night.	"Target fields best stadium in the american league," manager Ozzie Guillen said on his Twitter page after the win.	A.J. Pierzynski and Alexei Ramirez had two-run doubles in a five-run, seven-hit fifth inning for a team that entered the night with the worst batting average in the American League. Freddy Garcia (2-2) gave up two runs on nine hits in seven innings for the win.	Joe Mauer had three hits and Justin Morneau homered for the Twins. But Kevin Slowey (4-3) gave up five runs on eight hits in 4 2/3 innings against Chicago's anemic bats.	Juan Pierre had three hits, including his first extra-base hit of the year with a double in the ninth. Jenks picked up his sixth save in seven tries after being told earlier in the day he was no longer the full-time closer.	Guillen said he would go with matchups, with Jenks, who blew a two-run lead on Sunday against Toronto, J.J. Putz, Sergio Santos and lefty Matt Thornton all options.	He went back to Jenks, who gave up a one-out double to Jim Thome, prompting a visit from Guillen.	"I told him to throw the ball, throw strikes," Guillen said. "Whatever happens is my fault. Because I put you here. I have confidence in you. I showed you how much confidence I have in you. If that went wrong today, I would've taken a lot of heat."	Jenks bounced a curveball about 5 feet in front of home plate against Nick Punto, but came back to strike him out on the next pitch before getting Denard Span to ground out to finish the game.	"The thing he's been doing is missing location," Pierzynski said of Jenks, who carried a 6.75 ERA into the game. "He came out and got ahead of Punto and put him away. When he throws strikes, he's as good as anybody. He's just got to get his location back and get his confidence. Hopefully tonight is the start of that."	No team was happier to see the Twins leave the Metrodome than Guillen's White Sox. The outspoken manager never passed up an opportunity to slam the dingy, cramped old stadium, partially because of its stale atmosphere and quirky bounces and partially because his team always seemed to lose there. The White Sox lost 16 of their final 19 games indoors.	"No matter what kind of ballpark they built, it was going to be better than that one," Guillen said before the game.	The Twins got on the board first in the fourth inning when Delmon Young hit a double down the right-field line to score Mauer. But the potential for a bigger inning was squashed when third-base coach Scott Ullger tried to wave DH Jason Kubel all the way from first base home on the play and he was thrown out at home by 10 feet.	"Just one of those two-out situations where for the most part you tell your guy to send him," Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said. "You try to score with two outs. ... With two outs, you take more gambles than you do the other way."	The White Sox responded in a way their offense had not done this season. Chicago entered the game last in the AL in batting average (.228) and 10th with a .316 on-base percentage.	"We got a couple big hits. We went through a month where we couldn't get anything done," Guillen said. "You have a tendency to lose confidence. The last couple days we've swung the bat better. Hopefully that carries on."	The Sox set season highs in hits and runs in the inning, which also included an RBI-single from Alex Rios, who had two hits in the inning.	"One bad inning costs you a ballgame," Gardenhire said.	Game notes	 Rios extended his hitting streak to 12 games with a single in the fifth. ... Twins RHP Alex Burnett pitched well in relief of Slowey, allowing two hits in three scoreless innings. ... White Sox radio analyst Darrin Jackson is missing the series to tend to a family matter. Pre- and postgame host Chris Rongey filled in on WSCR alongside play-by-play man Ed Farmer.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Jake Westbrook opened the game with a four-pitch walk and worked around traffic for most of his six innings. He still didn't have full confidence in his sinker, dropping his arm angle to offset his insecurity.	What Westbrook did get was a win, his first since reconstructive right elbow surgery. No matter how he got there, that sure feels good.	Russell Branyan homered twice in support of Westbrook's first win in two years, lifting the Cleveland Indians to an 8-2 victory over the backpedaling Kansas City Royals on Tuesday night.	"It's nice to get that first win and pitch well doing it," said Westbrook, who had Tommy John surgery in June 2008. "It wasn't real pretty, but I put up some zeros and only gave up that one run. I had baserunners all night but made pitches when I had to."	Westbrook (1-2) used his sinker and an occasional drop-down delivery to induce 13 groundouts and held the Royals to five hits for his first win since April 8, 2008, against the Los Angeles Angels.	Branyan provided the power, hitting a two-run homer off Brian Bannister (1-3) in the second and a solo shot off Joakim Soria in the ninth for his first multihomer game in exactly three years. Jhonny Peralta added a two-run double, Austin Kearns scored three runs and had an RBI, and the Indians collected 10 hits to win consecutive games for the first time in a month.	"He [Westbrook] gave us a chance to get our lineup going," Indians manager Manny Acta said.	This matchup featured the bottom of the AL Central.	The last-place Royals were coming off a 3-8 season-long trip that ended with a four-game sweep at Texas. The lowlights included too many walks, shortstop Yuniesky Betancourt's fine-inducing botched popup and an inexplicable failure by the entire team to notice a runner advancing to second without tagging up.	The Royals followed the dismal trip with another clunker, getting an average outing from Bannister, an almost-predictable bullpen blowup and base-to-base hitting to see their losing streak reach six games.	"I think everybody is putting a lot of pressure on themselves in every aspect of the game," Bannister said after his 100th career appearance. "We're playing tense out there."	The Indians have only been marginally better.	Plagued by swing-and-miss hitting, Cleveland tumbled down the standings with three wins in 12 games. Cleveland struck out 86 times in an eight-game homestand and entered Tuesday as the third-worst team in baseball at scoring and hitting homers.	The Indians ended a five-game skid Sunday against the Detroit Tigers by getting five RBIs from their No. 7-8 hitters and got production from the middle of the lineup to beat the Royals in the opener of an eight-game road trip.	It was more than Westbrook needed.	He battled a tight back against the Toronto Blue Jays on Tuesday, allowing four runs in 3 2/3 innings. The right-hander was much looser against the Royals, allowing a run-scoring single to Billy Butler in the third inning but just one runner past first base after that.	"I'm very happy for Jake," Acta said. "He was finally able to get that first win and get over that hurdle of the sixth inning."	Bannister recorded just nine outs in his previous outing, against the Chicago White Sox last Wednesday.	The right-hander went a little deeper in this one but was hurt by two inopportune walks.	Branyan followed Kearns' leadoff walk in the second with his first homer since last August, pulling a pitch out of the strike zone over the wall in right-center. Another leadoff walk scored in the fourth, when Peralta hit a two-run double to the wall in left-center that put the Indians up 4-0.	Bannister allowed four runs and six hits in six innings.	"The walks hurt. Obviously, they hurt Banny," said Royals manager Trey Hillman, who was ejected in the seventh inning for arguing a close play at third on a double steal. "We've got to figure out something to eliminate them."	Cleveland blew it open against Kansas City's combustible bullpen in the seventh, scoring three runs on a groundout, a bases-loaded walk and Kearns' run-scoring single.	Game notes	 Cleveland center fielder Grady Sizemore had two singles after going 9-for-35 the previous eight games. ... Butler knocked in Kansas City's other run with a groundout in the eighth. ... Indians second baseman Mark Grudzielanek was 1-for-2 in his first game at Kauffman Stadium since leaving the Royals in 2008.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ST. LOUIS -- Brett Myers kept the Houston Astros close enough to capitalize on a big break.	Myers worked six strong innings and pinch-hitters Cory Sullivan and Humberto Quintero hit consecutive RBI singles in a four-run seventh after shortstop Brendan Ryan's throwing error in a 6-3 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals on Tuesday night.	"It kind of snowballs and that's a good thing," Sullivan said. "It's contagious and you want to stay with it."	Brad Penny (3-3) allowed four hits in seven innings with all four runs unearned after Ryan bounced a throw to first for an error on Carlos Lee's one-out grounder. Ryan Ludwick had three hits and an RBI for St. Louis.	"We had a chance to put them away, but we didn't," Penny said. "I felt too good to lose that game."	Myers (2-2) allowed two runs and eight hits in a rematch from April 14 in St. Louis against Penny, a 2-1 victory for St. Louis. He's worked at least six innings in all six starts and didn't disagree with an assessment that he battled.	"It seems like I hear that word a lot when I pitch, it's never really dominating, is it?" Myers said. "I didn't think I had my best stuff, but I think I was able to make pitches when I had to make pitches."	Cardinals manager Tony La Russa batted the pitcher ninth for the first time in 14 games in an effort to get leadoff man Skip Schumaker out of a slump. Schumaker was 1-for-4 batting seventh, but replacement leadoff man Colby Rasmus went hitless with three flyouts and a strikeout.	The Cardinals have scored only 14 runs in seven starts for Penny, who has a 1.70 ERA.	"We had three or four chances, good chances with good hitters up there," La Russa said. "When you don't add runs, you put yourself in this position."	La Russa was supportive of Ryan, who also had a fielding error in the third for his second career two-error game. Ryan's defense has been dazzling at times to make up for a .179 average and he said, "If I'm not picking it, I'm probably not suiting up."	La Russa said Ryan would start Wednesday and added, "He's got to turn the page on at-bats and fielding."	Chris Sampson got Albert Pujols and Matt Holliday on groundouts with two on to end the seventh, and Lance Berkman and Hunter Pence added homers off Jason Motte in the eighth to break it open. Matt Lindstrom finished for his seventh save in seven chances, and first since April 24.	"We all are in a rut," Pujols said. "I don't feel comfortable, I think Matt [Holliday] feels the same way."	Astros pinch-hitters are batting .250 (14-for-56) with 10 RBIs. Sullivan had been 1-for-18 before tying it with an opposite-field single off Penny. Quintero singled on the next pitch in his first pinch-hit opportunity for the lead and Michael Bourn added a bunt hit for an RBI.	The Cardinals missed a chance to blow it open in the third, settling for David Freese's RBI single and a 2-0 lead when Yadier Molina hit into an inning-ending double play with the bases loaded. Molina had been 4-for-5 with 11 RBIs with the bases loaded.	Bourn, the Houston center fielder who entered tied for the major league lead in assists, earned his sixth of the season when he easily threw out Schumaker trying to score on Penny's one-out line-drive single in the fourth.	Before the game, Bourn appealed a two-game suspension for making contact with an umpire. He had two hits and is 8-for-16 against the Cardinals.	Game notes	Geoff Blum is 11-for-27 against Penny after going 1-for-2 with a hit by pitch and got a spot start ahead of Pedro Feliz, 6-for-41 (.146) vs. the right-hander. ... Ludwick doubled, singled and walked against Myers, against whom he's 8-for-14 with two homers. Ludwick is also 10-for-16 against the Astros this season with two RBIs. ... The Cardinals' defense entered with an NL-high 37 double plays and added two Tuesday. ... Astros left-hander Tim Byrdak, on the DL with a strained right hamstring, will fly to Houston on Wednesday to be examined for a possible disk problem in his back.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PHOENIX -- Russell Martin and the Los Angeles Dodgers feasted on Arizona's slumping bullpen, and Diamondbacks manager A.J. Hinch has seen enough.	Martin hit a three-run homer, Ronnie Belliard drove in three runs and Los Angeles beat Arizona 13-3 on Tuesday night.	James Loney finished with four hits and two RBIs for the Dodgers, who had six players collect at least two hits. Jamey Carroll also drove in two runs.	The Dodgers scored 10 times in the last three innings while securing their first road series win of the season. They go for the three-game sweep on Wednesday night.	The Diamondbacks have lost five straight. Dan Haren (4-2) matched his season high with 10 strikeouts but also gave up 10 hits and four runs in 6 1/3 innings.	"It's not a good atmosphere here right now," Haren said.	Kelly Johnson drove in two runs and Chris Young also had an RBI for Arizona.	After the Diamondbacks scored three runs in the seventh to pull within one, the Dodgers pushed across seven in the eighth to put the game away. Carroll singled and scored on Martin's fourth homer of the season, then added a two-run single of his own later in the inning.	"It just seems like everybody was getting good pitches to hit, and they weren't missing them," Martin said.	Los Angeles scored nine of its runs off Arizona relievers, who have surrendered 26 runs in 11 2/3 innings over the past four games.	"Something's got to give," Hinch said. "This is going on entirely too long. It's frustrating, that's the easy word to use. It's pathetic. It's not acceptable at this level."	The Chase Field crowd of 21,030 booed when Daniel Stange walked Belliard with the bases loaded to make it 9-3 in the eighth.	Arizona gave up 17 hits for the second time on this homestand.	After Los Angeles' big eighth, Arizona went down in order in the bottom half on seven pitches.	"Nobody's hitting. That's the bottom line," Reynolds said. "It's tough to string stuff together when nobody's getting on base."	John Ely (1-1) allowed two runs and six hits in six-plus innings to pick up his first major league win. He was lifted after allowing back-to-back singles to Mark Reynolds and Stephen Drew.	"Feels great man, definitely pretty happy about it," said Ely, who turns 24 on Thursday. "Could have had that seventh inning go a little better, but other then that I'm real happy."	Ely, making his third career start, retired nine straight at one point and has gone 16 consecutive innings without issuing a walk.	"He doesn't seem like a rookie when he's out there," Martin said.	After Ely left, Chris Young greeted Jeff Weaver with an RBI single, and Johnson hit a two-run double off George Sherrill later in the inning.	Haren got off to a stellar start. He struck out eight of the first nine batters he faced and set a franchise record by fanning the side in each of the first three innings. Arizona's ace needed 54 pitches to get through those innings, and Los Angeles figured him out after that.	The Dodgers put up two runs in the fourth on consecutive doubles by Loney, Casey Blake and Belliard.	Game notes	 The last pitcher to record the first nine outs for his team by strikeout was San Francisco's Tim Lincecum on Sept. 28, 2008, also against the Dodgers. ... The Diamondbacks have struck out 49 times in the first five games of this homestand. ... Haren has only one win in his last eight starts against Los Angeles.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Scott Hairston started the game by challenging Barry Zito in an 11-pitch at-bat, and it hardly mattered he wound up flying out to center field.	The San Diego Padres got a good glimpse of what Zito had -- and what he didn't.	"That set the tone for the rest of the night," said No. 2 hitter David Eckstein, who later congratulated Hairston on his effort.	Zito's career-best start for San Francisco ended Tuesday night when he allowed Eckstein's two-run single and walked a season-high seven batters in the Giants' 3-2 loss to the first-place Padres.	Ryan Webb (1-1) went 1 1/3 innings to earn the win for the Padres, who extended their lead over the Giants in the NL West to 1 1/2 games.	Yorvit Torrealba also drove in a run for San Diego, which is without two key pitchers for unforeseen circumstances: starter Kevin Correia following the death of his younger brother in a hiking accident Saturday, and Tim Stauffer after he underwent an emergency appendectomy Tuesday morning.	Zito (5-1) couldn't locate his fastball and his pitch count increased in a hurry.	"I didn't have any command today," he said. "Sometimes it just happens no matter what you feel like."	After getting hits in his first two at-bats, including his two-run single in the second, Eckstein drew three straight walks.	This game was far from pretty: It featured a combined 26 runners left on base and 17 total walks.	"It's amazing we stayed in that game," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "Every time you looked up they had runners on base. They left a small battalion out there. We had our backs to the wall every inning."	San Francisco finished with 12 walks, its most since issuing 13 free passes May 18, 2007, at Oakland. But the Padres also stranded 15 baserunners.	"We want to get them in. We didn't," San Diego manager Bud Black said.	Zito was done after 108 pitches over five innings, his shortest outing of the year. He allowed three runs and six hits. The left-hander hadn't walked more than three in any of his previous outings this year.	The Padres were patient, something they talked about in their pregame preparation for Zito.	"He does a good job making you chase out of the zone," Eckstein said. "You have to lay off his hard cutters."	Zito is back in the good graces of the home crowd now that he's been winning regularly. The 2002 AL Cy Young Award winner with the A's, Zito was often booed during his struggles after signing a $126 million, seven-year contract before the 2007 season.	San Diego starter Wade LeBlanc was relieved after Juan Uribe's two-out RBI triple in the fifth. Aubrey Huff singled in a run in the third.	Heath Bell, the fourth Padres reliever, pitched the ninth for his ninth save in 11 chances, and San Diego won for the eighth time in the last 11 meetings in the rivalry, including a three-game sweep last month at home.	While this marked LeBlanc's second straight no-decision, the Padres are 5-0 in his starts and 10-2 over his last 12 dating to Aug. 29.	Game notes	 In a rehab outing for Class-A San Jose, Giants 2B Freddy Sanchez went 2 for 4 with two doubles and three RBIs. ... A moment of silence was held before the game in remembrance of late Tigers broadcaster Ernie Harwell and 22-year-old Trevor Brent Correia, who died Saturday. The pitcher was placed on the bereavement list Tuesday, though Black believes Correia will take his turn in the rotation Saturday at home vs. the Dodgers. ... Giants LF Mark DeRosa underwent an MRI exam and nerve tests on his troublesome left wrist, and he missed his second straight start. ... Giants cleanup hitter Bengie Molina has hit safely in every home game he's played. ... LeBlanc missed getting a hit for just the second time this year. ... Giants INF Emmanuel Burriss, recovering from a broken left foot, is in San Francisco this week to be around the team after rehabilitating in Arizona at extended spring training. He is taking groundballs and batting practice and hopes to start a rehab assignment in about four weeks. ... San Francisco's Eli Whiteside had his first career stolen base in the seventh.

PITTSBURGH -- Homer Bailey became the latest Cincinnati Reds starter to play a simple game of pitch-and-catch against the Pittsburgh Pirates.	Bailey threw a four-hitter without walking anyone Wednesday, leading the Reds over Pittsburgh 5-0 for a three-game sweep.	Bailey followed Johnny Cueto's one-hit gem at PNC Park on Tuesday. The Reds became the first team in the majors in nearly 10 years to pitch back-to-back complete-game shutouts without a walk -- Oakland's Tim Hudson and Barry Zito did it on Sept. 9-10, 2000, against Tampa Bay, according to STATS LLC.	"That's my first complete game as a pro, and I didn't even know how may pitches I had," said Bailey, who struck out six. "All of a sudden I looked up and thought, 'Oh, I'm in the ninth now. Cool.'	"[Catcher Ryan Hanigan] did an outstanding job behind the plate. We just kind of worked together the whole time," Bailey said. "I just sit there and throw the damn thing to the glove. It's that easy, right?"	Bailey (1-2) needed only 90 pitches -- 73 for strikes -- to close out the Reds' fifth straight win.	Pittsburgh accounted for only one run and 10 hits in the series. Just like Cueto, Bailey took advantage of the aggressive Pirates batters, not going to a single three-ball count and throwing more than four pitches to a single batter just six times.	Twenty-two of Bailey's first 23 pitches were strikes. The longest at-bat of the game? Opposing pitcher Zach Duke drawing eight pitches before striking out in the third.	Pittsburgh's Garrett Jones, who had two of the four hits and the only extra-base hit Wednesday, gave credit to Cincinnati's pitchers but said the Pirates made them out to look better than they are.	"We're just missing some pitches," he said. "And getting pitches to hit and not doing anything with them. I feel like we just start giving at-bats away."	Joey Votto and Drew Stubbs homered and Brandon Phillips added two hits for the Reds, who outscored the Pirates 16-1 in the series.	Bailey won for the first time this season and improved to 5-0 lifetime against the Pirates, including 3-0 at PNC Park. A day earlier, Cueto threw 103 pitches in his first career complete game.	"That as well-pitched two days as I've seen pitched in a long time," Reds manager Dusty Baker said. "That was epitome of pitch conservation right there."	The Reds got consecutive complete-game shutouts for the first time since June 9-10, 1989, when Jose Rijo and Tom Browning did it at Dodger Stadium.	"It's unbelievable the way those guys threw back-to-back games," Votto said. "Homer did pretty good carrying us all day, just like Johnny did last night."	Ranked 28th in the majors in batting average entering the game, Pittsburgh was shut out for the fifth time in 34 games this season.	"Get some hits," Pirates manager John Russell said when asked how his team can get more offense. "That's about all we can do. Somebody's got to start getting some hits.	"You throw 90 pitches and only [17] balls ... [Bailey] was efficient. ... Not taking anything away from him. He pitched a good game. But there's just nobody swinging the bat very well at all right now," he said.	Votto homered for the third time in his last five games -- his eighth of the season -- in the first.	Stubbs' homer, his third, was a solo shot in the fourth. Duke (2-4) lost his fourth consecutive decision.	Game notes	 Pirates shortstop Ronny Cedeno was not in the lineup because of a bruised right wrist. ... On April 21-22, Milwaukee also shut out the Pirates. The Brewers outscored Pittsburgh 36-1 in that series. ... Bailey lowered his career ERA against Pittsburgh to 1.58.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DETROIT -- The Detroit Tigers got exactly what they wanted from the first of two games against the New York Yankees on Wednesday.	Rick Porcello had a long and successful outing to set up a victory.	Porcello pitched seven sharp innings and Magglio Ordonez drove in one of two runs in the sixth, leading Detroit to a 2-0 win over the Yankees in the opener of a doubleheader.	"It was perfect for us," Tigers manager Jim Leyland said. "This sets us up OK for the second game."	The Yankees lost their season-high third in a row.	Porcello (3-3) had his best start of the season, giving up four hits.	"It was a big confidence-booster for me and our team needed this to help out the bullpen," Porcello said.	A few hours before the day game, Leyland lamented how much short starts have forced him to rely on relievers more than he'd like.	"Our bullpen will be at the Detroit Medical Center by June if this doesn't change," he said.	Porcello shut down the Yankees with a wicked slider after allowing 22 runs his previous four outings.	"It was more frustrating than anything," Porcello said. "The first couple starts were not good. Then I was better, but I wasn't getting better results."	Ryan Perry pitched a perfect eighth and Jose Valverde closed the game for his 10th save in 11 chances.	New York had a chance to make things interesting in the final inning when Jorge Posada drew a two-out walk, but Valverde ended the game by striking out Nick Swisher and celebrating with a pulsating squat on the mound.	Johnny Damon got a hit as Detroit took a 2-0 lead in the sixth.	Javier Vazquez (1-4) allowed only an infield hit through the first five innings and struck out a season-high seven in seven innings.	"I was throwing strikes and staying aggressive," Vazquez said. "We lost the game, but it was a big step forward for me.	He responded well to getting extra time to make some adjustments after giving up three homers -- matching a career high -- in a three-inning start May 1 in what was his shortest healthy outing since 2005.	Vazquez ended the first three innings with strikeouts and was cruising until Austin Jackson and Damon led off the sixth with singles. Ordonez followed with an RBI groundout, Miguel Cabrera singled and Ordonez scored on Brennan Boesch's single.	"Javy pitched a good game, but we didn't get anything done to help him," New York manager Joe Girardi said. "I was very pleased with the way he threw the ball. Any time you go seven innings and give up two runs, you've got a chance. They just outpitched us."	Porcello got out of jams in the second and fourth innings -- stranding five of the seven runners the Yankees left on base.	"Baseball is a strange game," Leyland said. "We go into the game with two pitchers that are struggling and both them looked like they've been pitching great all year."	Jeter has been great throughout much of his career but was hitless for the second straight game in Detroit and fell to 2-for-21 on the road trip.	"I'm not walking around thinking that I'm in a slump because I know I'm hitting the ball hard," Jeter said. "As long as I'm doing that, the hits will come."	Game notes	 Girardi joked he got Yogi Berra a doubleheader for his 85th birthday on Wednesday, letting the Hall of Fame catcher watch his favorite team before and after dinner with his grandkids. ... The Yankees put right-hander Alfredo Aceves on the DL with a back injury and put outfielder Greg Golson on the roster. ... Detroit recalled right-hander Alfredo Figaro and sent outfielder Ryan Raburn to Triple-A Toledo. ... Yankees right-hander Chan Ho Park, on the DL with a strained right hamstring, struck out three and gave up one hit in a scoreless inning Wednesday in an extending spring training game. ... Porcello stayed in the game after Swisher hit the back of his right shoulder with a comebacker in the seventh inning. ... Jackson, who New York dealt to Detroit in the Curtis Granderson deal, became the first player in the majors with 50 hits this season. ... Cabrera has a 10-game hitting streak.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MILWAUKEE -- The Atlanta Braves found a familiar way to beat up the Milwaukee Brewers.	Brooks Conrad homered, doubled and drove in four runs while subbing for injured Chipper Jones, and the Braves roughed up Milwaukee's bullpen once again for a 9-2 win Wednesday and a three-game sweep.	"You need to have confidence and get a little swagger back," Braves manager Bobby Cox said.	The Braves, a team not known for their potent hitting this season, outscored the Brewers 28-7 in the series.	Another late-game outburst by the Braves squandered a solid start by Yovani Gallardo and continued the Brewers' woes at home. They are 4-11 at Miller Park this season -- and after a day off Thursday, the Phillies are coming to town.	"I don't think anybody can explain why we've been having a tough time getting wins at home," Casey McGehee said. "We've got to figure out something."	The bullpen is a prime suspect, at least in this series. All three games were close early, only to turn into blowouts.	"It's been a little bit of an epidemic here, throughout the series," Brewers manager Ken Macha said. "It's not just one or two guys."	But it hasn't helped that starters are having trouble going deep into games, wearing Brewers relievers down.	Macha said he asked closer Trevor Hoffman on Wednesday morning if the veteran closer needed to pitch an inning after getting little work of late. Hoffman said yes -- not for his own benefit, but because the rest of the bullpen is so worn down.	It showed again Wednesday.	Gallardo left after pitching the top of the sixth, and the Brewers tied the game at 2-all in the bottom half of the inning.	The Braves then jumped all over Brewers relievers, scoring a total of seven runs in the final three innings. It looked a lot like the previous two games, when the Braves turned close games into blowouts.	Jason Heyward hit a hard shot off first baseman Prince Fielder's glove for a go-ahead double in the seventh inning.	"But it wasn't just that we scored, it was that we scored often," said Matt Diaz, whose pinch-hit double set up Atlanta's two-run seventh inning.	Conrad hit a two-run homer in the eighth and two-run double off Hoffman in the ninth. Jones, who is trying to shake off a nagging groin injury, appeared as a pinch-hitter in the ninth and hit an RBI double.	"It's sure nice to bounce back the way we did this series," Conrad said. "We got the bats alive and some great pitching."	Derek Lowe (5-3) was untouchable early on, holding the Brewers hitless through the first four innings before allowing a leadoff single to McGehee in the fifth.	Lowe said he threw more changeups Wednesday than he had all year, and he is abandoning his past philosophy of pitching mostly away from hitters.	"I needed to try new things and today was the first day," Lowe said. "It was a lot better."	Gallardo pitched a strong six innings, giving up two runs and five hits despite being hit hard in the left leg by a batted ball in the fourth inning.	A shot off the bat of Heyward smacked into Gallardo's leg just above his ankle. After being briefly examined by the Brewers' medical staff, he threw a few warmup pitches and stayed in the game. Gallardo said his ankle was "a little sore" afterward but it didn't really affect his pitching.	And Gallardo said the Brewers' starters are aware that the bullpen is getting worn out.	"Obviously, the deeper we go into games, the better," Gallardo said. "And we're all trying to do that."	Despite the sweep, McGehee said the Brewers aren't panicking.	"We've got enough guys with enough backbone to not roll over and die," McGehee said. "We're going to keep fighting. We'll figure this thing out."	Game notes	 Milwaukee OF Ryan Braun (elbow) sat out. He is expected back in the lineup after an off-day Thursday. ... Braves manager Bobby Cox said shortstop Yunel Escobar is preparing to return from a leg injury and likely will play for Triple-A Gwinnett on Friday before returning Saturday. ... Fielder was charged with an error in the eighth.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

MINNEAPOLIS -- The Minnesota Twins have more power hitters and a higher-profile lineup since an exasperated Ozzie Guillen first labeled them "The Piranhas" four years ago for their pesky style.	Well, they're still true to their roots.	The Twins picked up Carl Pavano this time, pecking away at John Danks before the go-ahead RBI single by Denard Span in the fourth inning of a 3-2 victory over the Chicago White Sox on Wednesday.	"This is a good team," White Sox leadoff man Juan Pierre said. "They beat us today by being fundamental. It's the reason why these guys win every year."	Span had two singles and a walk to give the Twins a lift at the top of the lineup and help them split the chilly two-game series with the White Sox, giving them a second 6-3 homestand at Target Field. The Twins are 8-1-2 in series this year, and the White Sox -- who are eight games behind the AL Central leaders -- are 2-7-2.	Their manager, Guillen, expressed his faith in this sputtering team this week, but Chicago is batting a league-low .230 after this game. The White Sox didn't score in 16 of 18 innings here.	Center fielder Alex Rios took a two-run homer from Michael Cuddyer with a jumping catch over the wall in the fifth inning with the Twins leading 3-2, causing Cuddyer to smack his hands on his helmet in disbelief, but the momentum didn't last.	"You think you have something going and that you're going to nail this one," Guillen said. "I was excited for the first inning. All of a sudden for seven or eight innings, nothing was done."	The Twins were shut out in each of Pavano's last two turns in the rotation, but he hasn't been fazed.	Pavano (4-3) put up his fourth straight start allowing two earned runs or less, totaling 30 innings during that span. After allowing a double steal by Pierre and Rios in the first inning, with one run scoring on catcher Joe Mauer's throwing error and another on Paul Konerko's single, Pavano refined his slide-step motion to keep the runners from cheating and stopped overthrowing his sinker.	He pitched, well, like a veteran.	"Carl adjusts real well. He has been around and seen a lot of different swings, and he's able to make adjustments on the fly," Mauer said. "He kind of had a rocky first inning or two, and then he made the adjustment and kind of cruised after that."	After the first, Pavano didn't let a runner get past first base. He finished seven innings, giving up six hits, and left the game to Brian Duensing, Matt Guerrier and Jon Rauch, who pitched a perfect ninth for his ninth save.	"My last thought in my mind was if they were going to score me runs," Pavano said. "I've said it before and I'll say it time and time again: I don't worry about that."	Konerko gave Rauch a scare with a long fly down the left-field line in the ninth inning, but it hooked away from the foul pole.	"We kind of told ourselves that this is as close to a must-win you get in May," Danks said, adding: "We're not out of it, but we definitely could've helped ourselves a ton by getting two."	Danks (3-2) has been by far Chicago's best starter, anchoring a rotation that hasn't been as good as advertised. The left-hander finished seven innings, giving up seven hits, some of them the kind of well-placed rollers the Twins thrived on at the Metrodome.	"We still have to manufacture runs," Cuddyer said. "Danks is coming in with a sub-2 ERA. You need to be able to try and capitalize when you can."	Mauer, catching consecutive games for the first time since returning from his foot injury, drove in a run with a weak groundout to second and twice grounded into double plays.	Justin Morneau drove in the tying run in the third with a single, and Delmon Young hit two doubles -- scoring on Span's single to give the Twins the lead in the fourth.	Orlando Hudson, given the option to bunt on his own, set up the rally in the third with a sacrifice that moved runners to second and third with one out.	"It was more of the Twins ball we're used to seeing," Morneau said.	Game notes	Carlos Quentin was originally out of the lineup until right fielder Andruw Jones reported a stiff neck. Guillen said Jones will likely be out for Friday's game, too. Quentin was 0-for-4 with a strikeout, dropping his average to .180.

NEW YORK -- If the New York Mets didn't know what Roger Bernadina was capable of, they certainly do now.	Bernadina hit his first two major league homers, including a tiebreaking shot off Francisco Rodriguez in the ninth inning, and made a marvelous catch to lead the surprising Washington Nationals past New York 6-4 on Wednesday.	"He had, so far, the game of his career," Mets outfielder Jeff Francoeur said.	Starting pitcher Craig Stammen drove in three early runs with a pair of hits for the Nationals (19-15), who took two of three from New York to win their third straight series -- all against NL East foes.	Coming off consecutive 59-win seasons, second-place Washington improved to 4-2 this year at Citi Field and 6-1-1 in its last eight series overall.	In this one, Bernadina did it all.	"It's good to see him coming into his own," Stammen said.	Tyler Clippard (7-1) worked a hitless inning and leads the majors in wins. He shook off the loss he took Tuesday night when the Nationals squandered a four-run lead in the eighth.	Matt Capps tossed a perfect ninth for his big league-best 14th save in 14 chances, sending what was left of the sparse crowd home on a damp and misty, 48-degree day.	Cristian Guzman singled off Rodriguez (2-1) with one out in the ninth. One out later, Bernadina, known for speed but not power, drove an 0-1 pitch into the Washington bullpen in right-center for his third hit of the game.	"It was his day," Rodriguez said.	New York tied it at 4 by scoring twice in the fifth off Stammen. Angel Pagan doubled, Alex Cora hit a run-scoring single and Jose Reyes lined an RBI double down the right-field line to snap a 9-for-44 slump.	Moments later, the Mets appeared poised to take the lead when Francoeur sliced a bases-loaded drive to deep right. But Bernadina retreated quickly on the slick grass and, with a fully extended dive, robbed Francoeur of an extra-base hit that surely would have scored three.	"I feel more confident and that's why I think things are getting better," Bernadina said.	Francoeur, stuck in a 12-for-84 (.143) slide, slammed his helmet to the ground in frustration after rounding first base.	"That ruined my day," he said. "It's one of those plays that sticks with you until you wake up the next day."	Washington went ahead in the second inning. Adam Dunn hit a leadoff double and went to third on Guzman's single. A walk to Willie Harris loaded the bases with nobody out, but Mike Pelfrey nearly wriggled out of the jam. He struck out Bernadina and Wil Nieves, leaving only the pitcher in his way.	Stammen, however, lined a 2-2 pitch through the left side for a two-run single.	Pelfrey also produced at the plate, hitting an RBI single in the bottom half that preceded Pagan's sacrifice fly.	Bernadina hit a solo shot to right with two outs in the fourth for his first homer in 115 career at-bats.	"The coaches felt he was ready to break out," Nationals manager Jim Riggleman said. "Before the game, I told the coaches I expected him to hit a double and a triple today. It turned out, it was even better."	Nieves followed with a double and Stammen bounced a single up the middle to make it 4-2. It was the eighth major league RBI for Stammen, who owns a .244 career average in 45 at-bats.	"It's usually going to be a long day when the pitcher has three RBIs on the other side," Pelfrey said. "That's unacceptable."	Game notes	 Washington right-hander Jason Marquis is scheduled for surgery Friday to remove bone chips from his ailing right elbow. He is expected back in August, general manager Mike Rizzo said. ... Stammen's three RBIs were the most by a Nationals pitcher since the franchise moved to Washington. Guillermo Mota, pitching in relief, also drove in three runs on June 9, 1999, for the Montreal Expos against Boston. ... Nationals catcher Ivan Rodriguez, batting .383, was rested. ... Pelfrey was pulled after 5 2/3 innings. He threw 119 pitches, matching a career high. It was the most by a Mets pitcher this season. ... Reyes, moved from leadoff to No. 3 in the lineup on April 23, was 7-for-38 (.184) with runners in scoring position before his double drove in Cora from second base. ... Washington is 6-1 in series rubber games this season. The Mets are 0-6.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

BOSTON -- Shaun Marcum has been pitching well enough to have a winning record, and now he does.	Marcum pitched two-hit ball for seven shutout innings and Travis Snider homered, doubled and drove in three runs Wednesday, helping the Toronto Blue Jays beat the Boston Red Sox 3-2 to salvage the finale of a three-game series.	"Marcum's pitched great. His record really doesn't show the way he's pitched," Toronto manager Cito Gaston said. "He's pitched outstanding. We just haven't been able to give him any runs a lot of the time. Even today, three runs, but he managed to hang on."	Marcum (2-1) allowed just two singles -- both to David Ortiz -- struck out six and walked one. It's the seventh time in eighth starts this year he's given up three runs or fewer. He entered with a .232 opponents' batting average, the second-lowest against an AL starter.	He just looked at it as a chance to end the trip with a win.	"It was very important. I had to go out there and pound the zone, make them put the ball in play, try to save our bullpen a little bit," he said. "Anytime I get the ball I want to go out there, if we've lost and try and stop the losing streak. I think anybody in the rotation wants to do that."	Toronto had lost its previous five games against Boston this season. The Blue Jays closed their trip at 7-3.	Scott Downs pitched a scoreless eighth and Kevin Gregg got three outs for his 10th save despite allowing J.D. Drew's RBI double and Adrian Beltre's run-scoring single.	With a runner on second and one out in the ninth, Ortiz was called out on strikes on a pitch that the Red Sox slugger appeared to think was outside. Manager Terry Francona came out to argue and was ejected three pitches later by home plate umpire Dale Scott when Beltre was at-bat and asked Scott to get help on a check swing.	"I'm glad I'm not right-handed," Ortiz said. "I would have been hit in the ribs."	Darnell McDonald popped out, ending it.	Tim Wakefield (0-2), reinserted into the rotation when Josh Beckett was pushed back because of back spasms, gave up three runs and five hits in seven innings.	But despite the strong start, Wakefield was uncertain whether he would head back to the bullpen or make another start.	"I have no idea," he said. "It's been very difficult. It's obviously a situation I don't want to be in."	Wakefield got his 2,000th strikeout when Vernon Wells fanned ending the fourth. The 43-year-old knuckleballer was saluted with a standing ovation when an announcement was shown on the center-field scoreboard as he walked off the field. He came back out from the dugout and tipped his cap to the Fenway Park crowd.	"I'm very proud of that," he said. "It's a tribute to longevity, and I feel very blessed to be able to wear this uniform for so long."	With Toronto leading 1-0 in the seventh, Snider homered into the Blue Jays bullpen after Jose Bautista drew a one-out walk.	Snider's RBI double had made it 1-0 in the fifth. Lyle Overbay snapped an 0-for-13 stretch with a ground-rule double when the ball bounced on the dirt in the center-field triangle area and into the Red Sox bullpen. Snider hit his double down the first-base line.	Boston's best chance against Marcum came in the second when Kevin Youkilis drew a leadoff walk and advanced to third on Ortiz's single. But Beltre had a shallow flyout and second baseman John McDonald made a nice grab -- with his back to the infield -- on Jeremy Hermida's popup in short center to end the inning.	Wakefield had been shuffled to the bullpen when Daisuke Matsuzka returned from the disabled list on May 1.	Game notes	 Boston finished a 7-3 homestand. ... Toronto second baseman Aaron Hill was a late scratch with a tight right hamstring. He was hitting just .187 in 19 games since coming off the DL from a right hamstring injury. ... Wakefield joined Jamie Moyer, Javier Vazquez and Andy Pettitte as the only active players who have reached 2,000 strikeouts. ... The Blue Jays had lost 10 of their previous 13 games in Fenway. ... There were a good amount of empty seats. Attendance was announced at 37,198, the 573rd straight sellout at Fenway.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

CHICAGO -- Don't blame the new guys -- Carlos Silva and Marlon Byrd -- for the Chicago Cubs' awful start.	Silva is undefeated after beating the Florida Marlins 4-3 on Wednesday and helping the Cubs stop a four-game losing streak. Byrd, who drove in the go-ahead run with a fifth-inning double, leads the team in batting and RBIs.	Had their teammates been as proficient, a ballclub with a high payroll and great expectations wouldn't be 15-20.	"This is his third team and my fourth. We're veterans, so the transition is a little easier," said Byrd, who has batted .400 over the last month to lift his average to .341. "We came in here and everybody was ready for us to contribute, and that's what we're doing."	While Byrd was signed as a free agent to play center field and hit in the middle of the lineup, the Cubs didn't know what to expect from Silva (4-0) -- an expensive underachiever Seattle insisted they take in the Dec. 18 deal for troubled outfielder Milton Bradley.	The 31-year-old right-hander was an effective pitcher for Minnesota from 2004-07 but went 5-18 in two years with the Mariners.	"I feel good, not only because I'm 4-0. I feel good because I feel like I am somebody right now," Silva said. "My first year with Seattle was very tough, and last year I lost confidence. This year ... (the Cubs) were like, 'We're so happy you're here.' That gave me confidence, made me feel they were counting on me."	Asked what he changed, he said: "I trust myself a little more. Just throw the ball and forget about everything else."	Silva threw 23 of 27 pitches for strikes in the first three innings as the Cubs went ahead on Mike Fontenot's two-run double. The Marlins tied it on Ronny Paulino's two-run single in the fourth but Silva, who allowed seven hits in 6 1/3 innings, otherwise pitched out of trouble.	Offense, not pitching, has been the Cubs' primary problem. In losing seven of their previous eight games, they scored 14 runs in the victory but totaled 14 in the seven defeats.	This time, they got just enough to beat Chris Volstad (3-3). He allowed four runs in six innings, the first time in 11 games a Florida starter gave up more than three runs.	"I didn't have my best stuff but I felt pretty good," Volstad said. "We won the series, which is good, but a sweep would have been nice."	Florida still is looking for its first three-game winning streak.	Kosuke Fukudome drew a one-out walk in the fifth, Starlin Castro singled and Byrd doubled for his 24th RBI. Castro then scored on a wild pitch when Paulino, the catcher, was unable to glove the ball just before it hit the dirt.	"My mistake," Volstad said. "I threw a changeup and it was supposed to be a curve."	Florida had two men on in the seventh but didn't score, as Sean Marshall induced pinch-hitter Wes Helms to ground into a double play. The Marlins put two on against Carlos Zambrano in the eighth before Carlos Marmol struck out pinch-hitter John Baker.	They finally scored in the ninth on Brian Barden's two-out pinch single. After Gaby Sanchez followed with a single, Marmol fanned All-Star Hanley Ramirez for his fifth save.	"He's a very good hitter, as everybody knows," Marmol said. "What can I say? I struck him out. That's what they pay me for."	Game notes	 Fontenot made an error in his first start at 2B since May 7, when Ryan Theriot was switched from SS to accommodate the hyped arrival of Castro from Double-A. ... Though the 20-year-old Castro doesn't have any RBIs since he drove in six in his memorable debut, he has hit safely in each of his six games for a .364 average. He had two singles Wednesday while batting second in place of Theriot, who sat out with hamstring tightness. Manager Lou Piniella said Castro would return to the No. 8 spot Friday if Theriot can play. ... It was 45 degrees and thick fog hovered over the ballpark. "I can't wait to get off the plane and start sweating," Florida's Jorge Cantu said. "I'm not a fan of the cold."... After hitting .123 in his first 13 games, Marlins LF Chris Coghlan is batting .309 in his last 16. Still, manager Fredi Gonzalez used Helms to pinch-hit for Coghlan against LHP Marshall. ... Florida CF Cameron Maybin was given the day off after hurting his left wrist when he crashed into the brick wall while making a catch Tuesday. He said he felt fine.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

DENVER -- The Philadelphia Phillies have seen enough of Miguel Olivo -- at the plate and behind it.	After being chided by Major League Baseball for using binoculars in the bullpen to spy on the Colorado Rockies catcher's signs, the Phillies watched Olivo go 5-for-5 on Wednesday, including a leadoff homer in the 10th inning that lifted the Rockies past Philadelphia 4-3.	The second game of the day-night doubleheader was postponed because of rain and snow with no makeup date announced. This was the Phillies' only scheduled trip to Denver this season.	Olivo's first career game-winning hit capped a dramatic recovery from a prolonged slump. He entered the game in a 2-for-28 skid.	Olivo sent Chad Durbin's first pitch, a hanging breaking ball, far over the left-field wall and then flipped his bat in celebration.	"I thought he was going to take it because he's a fastball hitter," said Durbin (0-1). "If he's looking for offspeed first pitch, then tip your hat to him."	Joe Beimel (1-0) threw 1 1/3 scoreless innings on a cold, damp and windy day that followed an overnight snowfall.	Olivo's second career five-hit game included three hits off Phillies ace Roy Halladay.	"Not many people do that to Halladay," Olivo said. "He's the greatest pitcher in the big leagues. But sometimes people make mistakes and you hit them."	Before the game, the Phillies insisted they weren't trying to steal signs when bullpen coach Mick Billmeyer was caught on camera peering through binoculars from the bullpen bench at Coors Field earlier this week.	Manager Charlie Manuel told The Associated Press that Billmeyer was simply watching Philadelphia catcher Carlos Ruiz set up defensively. However, FSN Rocky Mountain, the flagship broadcaster of the Rockies, showed Billmeyer using the binoculars to peer in on Olivo while the Phillies were at bat in the top of the second inning in the series opener.	Olivo said Billmeyer's actions could tarnish the two-time defending NL champions.	"If you're a good team and you win, I think you don't need to do that because they got good hitters, they got good players," Olivo said. "If it helps them, if they don't get caught, then whatever. If they get caught, then they're going to pay for it."	At least reputation-wise.	Olivo said his coaches told him to switch the signs every inning Monday night after Billmeyer was busted using the binoculars.	On Wednesday, Halladay took a 3-1 lead into the seventh in his quest for his seventh win, but the Colorado native wound up with a no-decision after Brad Hawpe's tying, two-run triple.	Halladay surrendered three runs, two of them earned, on 10 hits in 6 1/3 innings. He made his first start in Colorado since high school, pitching in a game with weather similar to what he had to deal with as a prep prodigy at Arvada West in the mid-1990s.	"He was having trouble gripping the ball," Manuel said. "The ball was taking off on him. He was battling, but it was cold. Their pitcher might have had the same problem."	Aaron Cook allowed three runs on eight hits in six innings.	Halladay refused to blame the wintry weather for his troubles.	"It really wasn't that bad. It was dry," he said.	In the fourth, Rockies second baseman Melvin Mora (right leg) and Ruiz (right knee) were knocked out of the game on the same strange play.	Ruiz, who had twisted his right knee on a play at the plate in the first inning when Carlos Gonzalez scored on a sacrifice fly to left, hit a groundball to third base, where Stewart stepped on the bag and threw to second base. Mora stretched awkwardly to his right to catch the throw and was unable to pivot and throw to first for a possible triple play.	Ruiz wasn't taking any chances at ignominy and raced down the line. He was replaced by pinch-runner Paul Hoover once he reached third base following a double by the next hitter, Wilson Valdez.	The Phillies said he was day to day.	The Rockies said Mora strained a gluteal muscle in his right leg on the play and is day-to-day. He was replaced by Eric Young Jr.	The Phillies said they would decide on their flight home how the rainout affects their rotation. The Rockies said right-hander Jhoulys Chacin would pitch as scheduled Thursday night against the Washington Nationals. Right-hander Jason Hammel (groin) was due to come off the 15-day DL to pitch Wednesday's nightcap but now wasn't sure when he'd be activated or when he'd start again.	Although the teams have common off-days later in the season, the game might not be made up if it doesn't matter in the standings.	Game notes	 Colorado manager Jim Tracy was ejected in the ninth for vehemently arguing first base umpire Corey Blaser's out call on Young's bang-bang play at first. ... The Phillies sent closer Brad Lidge back to Philadelphia to have his surgically repaired right pitching elbow examined by team doctor Michael Ciccotti.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

BALTIMORE -- The last time Brad Bergesen faced the Seattle Mariners, he yielded seven runs in less than three innings and earned himself a trip to the minor leagues.	In the rematch, Bergesen showed precisely how much better he is since the demotion.	Bergesen took a three-hitter into the eighth inning, Luke Scott homered and scored twice, and the Baltimore Orioles beat the Mariners 5-2 on Wednesday night.	Bergesen (3-2) allowed one run and five hits in 7 2/3 innings. The right-hander struck out three and walked two in winning his third straight start.	Since his return from Triple-A Norfolk, Bergesen has a 2.33 ERA. His latest performance was especially satisfying because of how awful he was in his previous outing against the Mariners.	"That last one in Seattle before I got sent down, it was really the epitome of all the (bad) starts," he said. "To come back and get a win against that same team, it feels good."	So, what the heck happened while he was pitching for Triple-A Norfolk that made him so good?	"My mechanics were off a little bit," Bergesen said. "Sometime when I was coming back from the (offseason) arm injury I picked up a bad habit somewhere. I'm not sure what it was, but that break helped me out a lot."	Adam Jones had three hits and third baseman Miguel Tejada drove in two runs for the Orioles, who defeated Seattle for the first time in five tries this season. Baltimore (10-24) became the last team in the majors to reach double figures in wins.	It was the ninth loss in 11 games for the light-hitting Mariners, who rank last in the AL in runs and 13th in batting average.	Seattle had threats in the second and fourth innings wiped out by double plays, a tribute to the manner in which Bergesen's sinker was working.	"He got in a couple of jams but was able to get the big pitch when he had to," Seattle's Chone Figgins said. "He got the double plays and Tejada made some big plays on defense."	Bergesen got the first two outs in the eighth before Ichiro Suzuki singled, stole second and scored on a single by Figgins. That ended Bergesen's night, and as he walked off the mound many in the soggy crowd of 11,448 gave him a standing ovation.	After Casey Kotchman singled against Will Ohman, Jose Lopez hit a drive off Koji Uehara that was caught by newcomer Corey Patterson at the base of the left-field wall.	Uehara gave up a walk and a single in the ninth before Alfredo Simon earned his fourth save, giving up a sacrifice fly to pinch-hitter Ken Griffey Jr. in the process.	"The game was about momentum," Seattle manager Don Wakamatsu said. "There were two keys: No. 1, was the starting pitching and No. 2 was the two double plays that allowed Bergesen to stay in the game."	Seattle starter Ryan Rowland-Smith (0-3) gave up three runs and seven hits in three-plus innings, the shortest of his seven starts this season.	"I have been pitching with a chip on my shoulder for as long as I've been pitching, like nothing else matters and there's nothing to lose. I haven't been doing that this year," Rowland-Smith said. "I need to get back to that. There have been some bumps in the road. I'm pretty close to being in a survival mode at this point."	Baltimore went up 2-0 in the third when Patterson and Jones hit successive singles and Tejada doubled both of them home.	Scott homered leading off the fourth. In the sixth, Scott doubled off Ian Snell and scored on a sacrifice fly by Cesar Izturis before Jones hit an RBI single.	Game notes	 Now in his second season, Bergesen is 9-2 at home and 1-5 on the road. ... Seattle placed SS Jack Wilson (hamstring) on the 15-day DL and recalled INF Matt Tuiasosopo from Triple-A Tacoma. Tuiasosopo went 0 for 2 with a walk. ... The Orioles purchased Patterson's contract from Triple-A Norfolk and farmed OF Nolan Reimold. ... Seattle LHP Erik Bedard threw 30 pitches in a simulated game Wednesday. He will pitch another simulated game in Oakland on Monday or Tuesday. ... Orioles 2B Ty Wigginton got hit in the left wrist with a ball while trying to break up a double play. "It hurt, but it's definitely better now," he said after the game.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- The Tampa Bay Rays came out of their series in Anaheim with a lot more confidence than they came in with.	The same probably can't be said of Angels backup catcher Ryan Budde, who allowed two passed balls that helped the Rays win 4-3 Wednesday, taking a series at the Angels for the first time in 11 years.	"It's important because the Angels are a playoff team. And if you get into the playoffs, you may end up playing here. So we have to have a better feel about it than we've had in the past," manager Joe Maddon said. "You really want to be able to play better in their venue somehow, and this should do a lot for our confidence here."	The Rays last won a series in Anaheim in May 1999. Since then, they lost 14 series, including seven sweeps, and split one.	David Price pitched into the seventh inning to win his third straight decision, and Tampa Bay improved its major league-leading record to 24-10.	Price (5-1) was charged with three runs -- two earned -- and seven hits in 6 1/3 innings. The left-hander struck out six, walked three and stranded five runners in scoring position -- two of them in the fifth when Bobby Abreu grounded out.	Rafael Soriano, the sixth Tampa Bay pitcher, threw a perfect ninth for his ninth save in as many attempts.	Abreu cut the Rays' lead to 4-3 in the seventh with a sacrifice fly against Randy Choate, who had just relieved Price.	Weaver (4-2) had a career-high 12 strikeouts in seven innings, but took the loss after giving up four runs -- one earned -- and six hits. The right-hander threw a career-high 120 pitches, after making 118 over 7 1/3 innings last Friday in an 8-0 win at Seattle.	Weaver used up 34 pitches in the first, allowing a pair of unearned runs after a throwing error by third baseman Kevin Frandsen on Jason Bartlett's leadoff grounder. Carl Crawford bunted for a hit, Ben Zobrist followed with an RBI double and Crawford scored on Budde's passed ball with two out and the bases loaded.	"I called for a slider and he threw a heater," Budde said. "We just talked about it two pitches before, so I really don't know whose fault it was. But I put the blame on myself. Mental mistakes are unacceptable around here, and I take full responsibility for what happened. I apologized to Weave. I should have been better back there today."	Two pitches earlier, Weaver struck out B.J. Upton looking and Budde started walking back toward the third base dugout with the ball in his hand, thinking it was the third out. He was about to roll it back to the mound when he saw Weaver breaking for the plate to cover in case Crawford tried to score.	"Things like that are going to happen," Weaver said. "Obviously it's not the way you want to start the game, with things going on like that, but it's a matter of what you're going to do from that point forward. I was a little upset after that first inning, but I tried to challenge my aggression in the right direction and keep the team in the game."	Weaver retired 13 straight batters -- a stretch that included five consecutive strikeouts -- before walking Bartlett with two out in the fifth and giving up a hit-and-run single by Crawford. Budde's second passed ball allowed Bartlett to score, giving the Rays a 3-1 lead.	Budde, making his third start this season, is on the roster because of injuries to Jeff Mathis and Bobby Wilson -- who has been on the DL since his collision with Mark Teixeira on April 23.	"Ryan Budde's a really sound defensive catcher, but he just missed a couple of blocked balls and got crossed up on one pitch," manager Mike Scioscia said. "Weave did what he could, but we didn't support him in the field like we needed to. There was a lot of damage done, but no one feels worse about it than Ryan does."	Game notes	The three unearned runs were the first this season against Weaver, who gave up only six unearned runs over the previous two seasons. ... Angels DH Hideki Matsui, fighting through a 6 for 52 rut and batting .228, didn't start. He grounded out as a pinch-hitter in the eighth for Mike Napoli, who struck out all three times up in the DH spot. ... Abreu had his first RBI in 14 games since April 27.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DETROIT -- Phil Hughes showed how fortunate the New York Yankees are to have him toward the back of their rotation.	He was sharp for seven innings, helping New York beat the Detroit Tigers 8-0 Wednesday to split a day-night doubleheader.	Hughes (5-0) gave up five hits, struck out eight and extended his undefeated streak to 10 games.	"On 15 to 20 teams, he's probably an ace," former teammate Johnny Damon said. "For the Yankees, he's the No. 4 starter."	All four starting pitchers on Wednesday were very effective.	Only one of them -- Hughes -- has been good all season.	The 23-year-old righty is the youngest Yankees starting pitcher to win his first five decisions since 1950, when Whitey Ford was 9-0.	"I probably didn't envision these exact numbers, but I really felt good coming out of spring training," said Hughes, whose 1.38 ERA is the league's best.	He didn't need much run support, but got plenty with a six-run ninth as ex-Yankee Phil Coke gave up four runs.	Hughes allowed two hits in the seventh and two hits along with a walk in the fourth, getting out of both jams dominating the bottom of Detroit's order.	"He's made some huge strides for us," manager Joe Girardi said. "We expected him to be a good starting pitcher coming out of spring training, but I think he has exceeded even what we were hoping we'd get."	Joba Chamberlain pitched the eighth, his seventh straight scoreless outing, and Mariano Rivera closed to get some work for the first time this month, ending the Yankees' season-high, three-game losing streak.	Jeremy Bonderman (1-2) struck out a season-best seven in a season-long seven innings.	Alex Rodriguez's two-out single in the first scored Brett Gardner, who singled and stole his 16th base this season. Mark Teixeira's two-out single in the third brought home Derek Jeter, who walked and stole second.	The Tigers won the opener 2-0 thanks to pitcher Rick Porcello and a two-run sixth.	They got exactly what it wanted from the first game, a long and successful outing from Porcello that set up a victory and gave an overused bullpen a break.	"We came out of this pretty good," Tigers manager Jim Leyland said. "We saved our bullpen."	Porcello (3-3) gave up four hits over seven innings, his best start of the year, and Magglio Ordonez drove in one of two runs in the sixth.	"It was a big confidence-booster for me and our team needed this to help out the bullpen," said Porcello, who gave up 22 runs his previous four starts.	Ryan Perry pitched a perfect eighth and Jose Valverde closed the game for his 10th save in 11 chances, celebrating with a pulsating squat on the mound.	Johnny Damon' hit helped Detroit take a 2-0 lead in the sixth.	Javier Vazquez (1-4) allowed only an infield hit through the first five innings, and struck out a season-high seven in seven innings.	"We lost the game, but it was a big step forward for me," he said.	Vazquez responded well to getting extra time to make some adjustments after giving up three homers -- matching a career high -- in a three-inning start May 1 in what was his shortest healthy outing since 2005.	Vazquez was cruising until Austin Jackson and Damon led off the sixth with singles. Ordonez followed with an RBI groundout, then Miguel Cabrera singled and Ordonez scored on Brennan Boesch's single.	"Javy pitched a good game, but we didn't get anything done to help him," Girardi said.	Porcello got out of jams in the second and fourth innings -- stranding five of the seven runners the Yankees left on base.	"Baseball is a strange game," Leyland said. "We go into the game with two pitchers that are struggling and both them looked like they've been pitching great all year."	Game notes	 Girardi joked he got Yogi Berra a doubleheader for his 85th birthday on Wednesday, letting the Hall of Fame catcher watch his favorite team before and after dinner with his grandkids. ... The Yankees put RHP Alfredo Aceves on the DL with a back injury and replaced him with OF Greg Golson on the roster, whose first major league hit was in the ninth of the nightcap. ... Jackson, who New York dealt to Detroit in the Curtis Granderson deal, became the first player in the majors with 50 hits this season. ... Jay-Z and Eminem were at the game to promote their concerts on Sept. 2 at Comerica Park and Sept. 13 at Yankee Stadium.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- Derek Holland was sharp in his first major league start of the season, and he got plenty of support from his Texas Rangers teammates.	Holland struck out seven in six shutout innings, Josh Hamilton and Vladimir Guerrero hit consecutive homers, and the Rangers routed the Oakland Athletics 10-1 on Wednesday night.	Holland (1-0) allowed five hits and walked one while throwing 103 pitches. The left-hander was recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma City earlier Wednesday to take the rotation spot of Matt Harrison, who went on the 15-day disabled list with left biceps tendinitis.	Michael Young, Max Ramirez and Hamilton all homered and each had three hits to help the Rangers take over sole possession of first in the AL West after beginning the night tied with the A's.	Rookie Justin Smoak also connected as the Rangers had a season-high five homers and 17 hits.	"Derek Holland did what we needed him to do," Texas manager Ron Washington said. "He was very aggressive out there. Then we put some runs on the board. He was able to command (his fastball) on both sides of the plate. There was nothing down the middle. When you can command your fastball that creates confidence."	Holland, who went 8-13 for Texas as a rookie last season, was a strong candidate to secure a rotation spot out of spring training before he sustained a mild right knee sprain during an agility drill on Feb. 20.	The injury limited Holland to four outings in Arizona, and he opened the season in Oklahoma City where he was dominant, going 4-1 with a 0.93 in six starts.	Holland said his outing was simply a carryover from his performance at Triple-A.	"It's huge," Holland said. "It keeps my confidence going. It shows I can pitch as well here as I did there."	Texas has won five of six and nine of 12.	The Rangers went in front 2-0 in the fourth against Gio Gonzalez (3-3) with the help of the left-hander's balk.	Ian Kinsler's double drove in Guerrero from first, and Kinsler went to third on a flyout. Kinsler ran toward home before stopping, and Gonzalez stepped off the rubber, then threw wildly to the plate with Kinsler scoring.	At first, home plate umpire Tim Tschida ruled a throwing error on Gonzalez, but after the game the umpires called the press box to announce that the call had been changed to a balk.	"I was going to try and steal home," Kinsler said. "He did something funky and threw it. From my angle, it looked like a balk."	Young singled leading off the fifth and Hamilton followed with his seventh homer of the season, a 427-foot shot to right-center for a 4-0 pad.	That ended Gonzalez's outing after allowing four runs and nine hits in four-plus innings.	"His overall stuff wasn't as crisp as he has been," A's manager Bob Geren said.	Guerrero greeted Chad Gaudin with his seventh homer to make it 5-0.	Ramirez and Young added solo shots in the sixth off Gaudin, giving the Rangers four homers in a span of nine batters, and Smoak's two-run blast in the seventh off Henry Rodriguez extended the lead to 9-0.	Eric Patterson's homer in the eighth off Doug Mathis ended the shutout bid.	Game notes	 Geren said C Kurt Suzuki will need a few more games in his minor league rehab assignment with Triple-A Sacramento before he's ready to be activated. Suzuki, who went 2 for 2 with a homer, double and three RBIs in Tuesday night's game at Oklahoma City, has been on the 15-day DL since April 30 with an intercostal strain. ... Oakland RHP Justin Duchscherer will throw in the bullpen again on Thursday to test the sore left hip that has kept him on the 15-day DL since April 25. Duchscherer is scheduled to be activated for Saturday night's road start against the Los Angeles Angels. ... Rookie CF Craig Gentry was in Texas' original starting lineup, but he was scratched due to an upset stomach. David Murphy was inserted in LF, with Hamilton shifting from LF to CF. ... Texas OF Nelson Cruz went 2 for 4 for Triple-A Oklahoma City on Wednesday, and Washington said Cruz will be activated for Friday night's game at Toronto. Cruz has been on the 15-day DL since April 27 with a right hamstring strain. ...The Rangers had back-to-back homers for the third time this season. Guerrero's been involved in all three.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The Cleveland Indians have been waiting for Russell Branyan to break out of his power outage.	The wait is over.	Branyan hit a two-run homer and Fausto Carmona and three Cleveland relievers combined to help the Indians shut out the Kansas City Royals 4-0 on Wednesday night.	Branyan hit 31 home runs last season with Seattle, but had none this season before hitting three and driving in five runs in the past two games.	"Russell was big again today, the two-run homer gave us a cushion, which was very important," Indians manager Manny Acta said. "We needed some thump in our lineup and he's a guy who can provide that. With a home run, there's no manufacturing. They come with one swing and he's swinging pretty good right now."	Asdrubal Cabrera snapped an 0 for 16 skid with two-run single in the fifth inning.	"I had Cabrera 2-2 and I didn't make a very good curve ball to him," said Kyle Davies. "It was probably one of the worst pitches I made the whole inning and it resulted in two runs,"	Carmona allowed five hits, walked two and struck out two in five scoreless innings, lowering his earned run average to 3.43. Carmona (4-1) is only one victory shy of matching his 2009 total when he went 5-12 with a 6.32 ERA. He stranded seven runners in the first four innings.	"When I had men on third and second, I don't think about it," Carmona said. "I have to make a good pitch and get them out, not try to over throw."	Relievers Aaron Laffey, Chris Perez and Tony Sipp limited the Royals to four more hits over the final four innings.	The Royals have lost seven straight and nine of their last 10.	Davies (2-2) gave up two runs on six hits and a walk, while striking out four in five innings.	The Royals, who have scored just nine runs in their past five games, stranded a season-high 13 runners and went 1 for 10 with runners in scoring position. Designated hitter Jose Guillen left seven runners on base, including striking out to end the seventh with the bases loaded.	"We worked some type of Houdini acts out there," Acta said. "We pressed our luck a little bit, but the guys ended up getting the outs. You've got to give credit to Fausto. He had good life on his fastball. He kept the ball on the infield on those pop ups with runners on second and third."	Alberto Callaspo hit two doubles, the only extra-base hits for the Royals. Scott Podsednik and Mike Aviles each had two singles for the Royals.	"The last 18 innings we've scored two runs," Royals manager Trey Hillman said. "That's not indicative of what our offense has the ability to do. The high leverage hitsthey're just not there in the same way they were in the first couple of weeks of the season. I'm not sure there's a stronger word than exasperating. If you can come up with a stronger one, that's probably it.	"Carmona was pounding the inside part of the zone hard. We're getting long, trying to do too much, sometimes swinging out of the zone. We're just trying to do too much in adrenaline situations. They need to relax and let the game come to them."	There was a rain delay of 26 minutes after the third inning and a 70-minute rain delay after the fifth.	Game notes	 Royals manager Trey Hillman altered his batting order, moving RF David DeJesus from leadoff to the third slot. Podsednik, who had been hitting second, hit first. Butler, who had hit in the third slot for 27 games, hit cleanup. ... Kendall was hit by a pitch for the 250th time, the most by an active player, in his 2,000th career game. ... The Royals promoted rookie RHP Blake Wood, who was 2-1 with a 2.16 ERA and five saves with Triple-A Omaha. ... RHP Josh Rupe, who failed to retire any of the four Indians batters he faced Tuesday, was designated for assignment. Rupe was 1-1 with a 5.59 ERA in 11 relief appearances.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ST. LOUIS -- Finally, the Houston Astros gave Wandy Rodriguez some runs to work with.	Rodriguez carried a one-hitter and an eight-run cushion into the sixth inning and Lance Berkman homered for the second straight game in a 9-6 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals Wednesday night.	"I said thank you to them," Rodriguez said. "I try to make good pitches, that's what I do."	Cardinals shortstop Brendan Ryan endured a second straight two-error game and his fielding miscue in the fourth helped the Astros score five unearned runs to go ahead 6-1. Jeff Keppinger's three-run double and Berkman's fourth homer of the season that glanced off the right-field foul pole came on consecutive pitches from Kyle Lohse (0-3).	"I was praying, leaning -- let the thing stay straight," Berkman said. "Anytime you can score runs early and let your guy relax a little bit, that's good."	The Astros totaled 12 runs in the left-hander's first six starts. Not that much would have helped Rodriguez after he gave up seven earned runs in 8 2/3 innings in a pair of losses to start May.	Rodriguez (2-4) allowed four earned runs on five hits in six innings. Manager Brad Mills preferred to savor the first five innings.	"He was pounding the zone with everything," Mills said. "He came out so aggressive and you could tell his demeanor was great."	Keppinger also singled and scored after a 2-for-20 slump and Berkman's homer was the first in 100 2/3 innings allowed by Cardinals starters at home. Berkman also matched a career best with four walks, the first three off Lohse.	Keppinger wore a hat shaped like a giant taco as he met with media, although he denied he'd been slumping.	"You're going to go through spells during the season where you feel good but you're just not making solid contact," Keppinger said. "That's kind of how it felt for me.	"I'm glad this was the game where I started to come through," he said.	Houston led 9-1 before Rodriguez (2-4) said his arm motion got out of whack. The Astros still had plenty to win their third straight and saddle St. Louis with only its third series loss out of 11 this season and for Rodriguez to end a seven-game road losing streak over 10 starts.	It's also the Astros' first series win at 5-year-old Busch Stadium and their first of three or more games in St. Louis since taking two of three Sept. 14-16, 2004.	Rodriguez added a single and sacrifice fly for his first RBI of the season and is 5-for-14 at the plate.	The Cardinals' rotation entered with a major league-leading 2.50 ERA and Lohse is the only starter without a victory -- he also has a 5.68 ERA. He allowed nine runs, a career high.	"I just wasn't very good all around," Lohse said. "I left a couple up, left a lot up, and every time I left it up they hurt."	Defense had kept Ryan in the St. Louis lineup, with great range and only three errors the first 32 games. He was also 0-for-3, dropping his average to .173 after taking early batting practice.	Ryan noted both errors were difficult plays. The ball glanced off his glove on a soft sinking liner by Humberto Quintero gave the Astros two on to start the eighth.	"I thought I was going to catch it at my belt at the minimum," Ryan said. "Next thing I knew I was trying to make a catch at my shoetops. That's two tough ones, I don't do anything different, really."	After both games, manager Tony La Russa offered comforting words.	"I just know he's a really good defensive player," La Russa said. "This happens, hang with it."	Albert Pujols and David Freese had RBI doubles in the sixth for St. Louis, which has lost six of eight. Ryan Ludwick had three hits and is 13-for-21 against Houston pitching this season.	Matt Lindstrom got the last out for his eighth save in eight tries, allowing an RBI double to Pujols before Matt Holliday lined out. Lindstrom has 20 straight saves sinec April 28, 2009, and hasn't allowed a run in his last 10 appearances covering 10 1/3 innings.	Game notes	 The Astros fielded their major league-leading 32nd different lineup. The Cardinals aren't too far behind with 28. ... Pedro Feliz had an infield hit in the second for his 1,000th career hit, ending an 0-for-9 drought, and singled in the fourth. ... Michael Bourn had two hits and is 10-for-21 against the Cardinals. ... The Astros are 11-3 when scoring four or more runs and 1-18 otherwise.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

PHOENIX -- Unable to shake the memory of getting hit in the head here nine months ago, Hiroki Kuroda felt more nervous than usual when he took the mound Wednesday night against the Arizona Diamondbacks.	He needed less than an inning to calm down.	Kuroda made a successful return to Chase Field and Manny Ramirez had three RBIs to help the Los Angeles Dodgers complete a three-game sweep of Arizona with a 6-3 win.	"I am a human being so I was a little bit nervous facing that first hitter," Kuroda said through an interpreter.	The right-hander walked the first batter he faced on four pitches but then retired nine straight en route to improving to 4-1.	"What happen happened, and I can never forget that," said Kuroda who sustained a concussion when he was drilled in the side of the head by Rusty Ryal's comebacker on Aug. 15. "I think that's one of the reasons why I wasn't pitching very well to the first batter in the first inning. That came into my mind a little bit there. I had to regroup myself in the second inning and started to cruise afterward."	Kuroda struck out nine while allowing three runs in 7 1/3 innings.	"I thought he was terrific," manager Joe Torre said. "It looked like he had real good action on his pitches and was in pretty good counts all day."	Andre Ethier added his 11th home run and had two RBIs for the Dodgers, who won their season-high fourth straight.	"We definitely carried over momentum from that Colorado series," Ethier said. "It was definitely a momentum changer beating Ubaldo Jimenez on Sunday, and we didn't have a let down coming in here."	Jonathan Broxton allowed the tying run to get to the plate in the ninth before getting his fourth save in six attempts.	Adam LaRoche drove in all three runs for Arizona, which lost all six games of a homestand.	After playing 20 games in 20 days, the Diamondbacks have an off day Thursday before heading to Atlanta and Florida to try and break out of its slump.	"It's a much needed off day," LaRoche said. "Hopefully we'll regroup a little bit and realize we're a lot better team than this."	Edwin Jackson (1-5) gave up six runs on seven hits in 6 2/3 innings.	Trailing by one with two outs in the seventh, the Diamondbacks intentionally walked Ethier -- the National League leader in average, home runs and RBIs -- to load the bases for Ramirez, a 12-time All-Star. He responded by lining a three-run double off the wall in center for a 6-2 lead.	Ethier said he was "shocked" by the move.	"It's a tough call," Arizona manager A.J. Hinch said. "The way it turns out, obviously, it's a bad call. Two of the hottest hitters in the league with kind of all the money on the table. Unfortunately we'll never know if we go the other way, how that plays out."	Torre said when he was manager of the New York Yankees he intentionally walked the bases loaded ahead of Ramirez.	"He almost knocked the wall down in Fenway. It's not an easy spot for an opposing manager, knowing how hot Ethier is and knowing the reputation of Manny," he said. "We're in a good spot in that situation for sure."	Kuroda, who returned three weeks after he was hurt, gave up a leadoff single to Conor Jackson before departing in the eighth with a four-run lead. Justin Upton and Mark Reynolds later drew back-to-back walks to load the bases with one out, but Arizona managed only one run, on a sacrifice fly by LaRoche.	Tony Abreu greeted Broxton with a single and Cole Gillespie walked with one out, but the Dodgers closer fanned the next two batters to end the game.	The series sweep was the first of the year for Los Angeles, which improved to 7-11 on the road.	"We haven't won a series on the road and to get a sweep here is great," Torre said.	Game notes	 Seeking help for their struggling bullpen, the Diamondbacks called up RHP Carlos Rosa from Triple-A Reno prior to the game and optioned RHP Daniel Stange, who has a 13.50 ERA in four innings, to Reno. Manager A.J. Hinch indicated this could be the first of multiple moves involving his bullpen, which came into the day with a major-league worst 7.55 ERA. ... Dodgers C Russell Martin extended his hitting streak to eight games. It is his longest since 2008. ... The last time the Diamondbacks were swept on a homestand of at least six games was July 15-25, 2004, when they lost 11 straight.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

SAN FRANCISCO -- The San Diego Padres are doing all the little things that first-place teams do: aggressive baserunning, manufacturing runs, pressuring the opposing pitcher.	Yorvit Torrealba drove in two runs against his former team, pitcher Clayton Richard had a sacrifice fly to help his cause and the Padres stayed unbeaten this year against the rival San Francisco Giants with a 5-2 win Wednesday night.	The Padres increased their division lead over the Giants to 2 1/2 games and beat San Francisco for the ninth time in the last 12 meetings, including going 5-0 this season.	"We're just playing really good baseball right now, not just against the Giants," Richard said. "When you play the way we've been playing, you'll end up beating a lot of teams."	Richard (2-2) allowed seven hits for the fourth time this season but won his second straight decision with seven strong innings, outpitching Matt Cain and delivering a solid outing after the Padres handed Barry Zito his first loss of the year Tuesday night.	Giants manager Bruce Bochy called his first team meeting of the year afterward.	"We have not played well against them, that's the bottom line," Bochy said. "Their pitching has shut us down and we're making all the mistakes. They're playing better ball than us, there's no getting around it and we know it. We're a better club than this. We're just making way too many mistakes."	Jerry Hairston Jr. hit a go-ahead RBI double in the fourth to make it 3-2, then Torrealba hit his second RBI single of the game in the sixth. Scott Hairston added a sacrifice fly in the seventh for the Padres.	Torrealba is batting .323 (40 for 124) with three home runs and 22 RBIs against the Giants since they traded him to Seattle during the 2005 season.	"I don't know what to say about that -- I see the ball well against these guys," Torrealba said.	At 21-12, the Padres have the second-best start in franchise history through 33 games. The 1998 teams -- skippered by Bochy -- began 22-11 and went on to win the division.	Richard, the second lefty starter in as many nights for San Diego, had 1-2-3 innings in the second, third, fifth and seventh on the way to winning on the road for the first time in 2010. Heath Bell pitched the ninth for his 10th save in 12 chances.	The Giants have dropped their first two of a six-game homestand following a 4-2 East Coast road trip.	Andres Torres singled in a run for the Giants in the second, then they pushed another across on a balk against Richard. But San Francisco missed chances, too. Aubrey Huff grounded into double plays in the second and fourth innings following leadoff singles both times by Bengie Molina.	San Francisco had the bases loaded in the sixth but second baseman David Eckstein made nice diving stop on Nate Schierholtz's sharp grounder and flipped the ball to Jerry Hairston covering second.	Cain (2-2) matched his career high by walking six batters -- his walk total over his previous six outings was 10 -- and was tagged for five earned runs to double his total in his initial three starts at home. Cain is winless in his last four starts against San Diego dating to a win on April 21, 2009, and the Giants have lost the last three. He threw 114 pitches in 6 2/3 innings.	"We've had some close games and we've done some things right and we've done some things wrong," Cain said. "Mainly today I did a lot of things wrong and that's the reason we lost."	Game notes	 San Diego's Will Venable stole his ninth base and Jerry Hairston swiped second and third in the eighth to double his previous season total of two. ... Giants LF Mark DeRosa underwent further tests on his troublesome left wrist, which caused him to miss his third straight start. ... The memorial service Trevor Brent Correia, the younger brother of Padres pitcher Kevin Correia, will be Thursday in San Diego. He died in a hiking accident Saturday at age 21. Kevin Correia is set to start Saturday at home vs. the Dodgers. "He's in there," manager Bud Black said. ... The Padres still expect to get SS Everth Cabrera back from a hamstring injury this weekend. ... Black on burly Giants slugger Pablo Sandoval, nicknamed the Kung Fu Panda: "He's like a Grizzly bear going for a salmon on the Kenai Peninsula." ... Black on Giants fans booing nice guy Eckstein (star for the Angels in their 2002 World Series victory over San Francisco): "How can you boo Eck, are you kidding me?" ... Milton Schwartz threw out the ceremonial first pitch on his 90th birthday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

BALTIMORE -- Down by four runs in the eighth inning, the Baltimore Orioles could hardly have imagined an afternoon featuring a celebration at the plate, a shaving cream pie to the face of newcomer Corey Patterson and the sounds of Jay-Z blaring in the clubhouse.	Luke Scott hit a grand slam to cap a five-run eighth against reliever Brandon League and the Orioles rallied to beat the Seattle Mariners 6-5 on Thursday.	"Moments like this, this is why we play the game," Scott said in the jubilant clubhouse.	The victory wasn't assured until Patterson unleashed a throw from left field that nailed Josh Wilson at the plate for the final out. Wilson tried to score from second on Ichiro Suzuki's single.	Patterson, who also homered, was in the midst of a postgame television interview when he received a shaving cream pie to the face from teammate Will Ohman. Summoned from Triple-A Norfolk on Wednesday, Patterson has already contributed to two victories.	"It's been a little bit whirlwind, but it's all worth it," he said. "I'm glad to come in and help these guys win some games."	Held to five hits over seven innings by Seattle starter Felix Hernandez, the Orioles promptly broke loose against League (3-3).	Patterson hit a leadoff homer to start the comeback from a 5-1 deficit. Adam Jones reached when League threw a wild pitch on strike three and Nick Markakis followed with a single. One out later, a walk loaded the bases for Scott, who drove League's first pitch into the front row of the left-field bleachers.	Fans tussled for the ball above the outstretched glove of Michael Saunders. Scott briefly stopped between first and second base and then thrust his arm skyward and smiled broadly when he realized the opposite-field drive was being a ruled a home run. It was his second career slam and Baltimore's first this season.	"I knew I hit it well, but the thing about this park at this time of year is the weather," Scott said. "The cold, heavy air is going to knock down the ball a lot. That's what I was thinking. I was hoping it had enough."	A despondent League accepted responsibility for the disheartening defeat.	"We have a nice lead and I give up a solo home run and a grand slam," he said. "I guess it can't get worse than that. It could, but it's pretty bad."	Manager Don Wakamatsu said, "Obviously, that's a tough loss. We ended up having one bad inning that spoiled the day."	Mark Hendrickson (1-0) pitched 1 1/3 innings in relief for Baltimore starter Kevin Millwood, who remains winless after eight starts.	Alfredo Simon worked the ninth to earn his fifth save, the second in two games. Patterson helped preserve it with his throw to catcher Matt Wieters, who tagged out Wilson.	Simon was backing up the play and added his own out call as the Orioles streamed out of the dugout.	"I knew we were going to have a chance," Wieters said. "I knew it was going to have to be a good strong throw, and if the throw was accurate and strong we had a shot at it."	Seattle lost for the 10th time in 12 games despite getting a fine outing from Hernandez and hitting a season-high three home runs. Ichiro and Mike Sweeney both homered for the first time this season, and Saunders hit No. 2.	The Mariners came into the game with a major-league low 13 home runs, and only once before had they hit more than one in a game.	After the Orioles went up 1-0 on a fourth-inning RBI single by Ty Wigginton, Seattle bounced back with a three-run fifth. Saunders, the No. 9 hitter, hit a two-out RBI single before Ichiro sent a 2-0 pitch over the right-field wall.	Sweeney hit a solo shot in the sixth, and Saunders chased Millwood with a seventh-inning drive.	But it wasn't enough.	"In the end, we went to a guy [League] who's been doing a lot for us," Wakamatsu said. "He left some pitches up in the zone and we got hurt."	Game notes	 Baltimore has six outfield assists this season, all of them on throws to the plate. ... Seattle outfielder Franklin Gutierrez sat out a second straight game Thursday with a sore upper-back muscle. ... Hernandez has not won since beating Baltimore on April 21.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

DETROIT -- On Monday, the Detroit Tigers pitching staff seemed to be on the verge of collapse.	Three days later, everything is fine.	Justin Verlander kept up a much-needed success streak for the Detroit rotation, throwing 6 2/3 shutout innings in the Tigers' 6-0 victory over CC Sabathia and the New York Yankees on Thursday.	Miguel Cabrera homered, doubled and drove in three runs for the Tigers, who took three of four from New York. The Yankees had only lost one other series this season.	"I thought we pitched very well against a team with a relentless offense," Tigers manager Jim Leyland said. "There's no place to relax against the Yankees from one to nine."	After a string of poor starts and Dontrelle Willis having to be scratched Monday with the flu, the Tigers were heading into Tuesday's scheduled game with just three available relievers.	They got a break, though, as the game was rained out. Rick Porcello and Jeremy Bonderman then combined to allow just two runs in 14 innings of Wednesday's doubleheader split. Detroit won the opener 2-0 and lost the nightcap 8-0 after New York scored six runs in the top of the ninth.	Verlander picked up where Porcello and Bonderman left off. Joel Zumaya and Eddie Bonine finished off the shutout.	"That was absolutely huge," Leyland said. "Porcello, Bondo and Verlander saved us against a great hitting team."	Verlander said he hopes that the three strong outings are the sign of a resurgence for Detroit's struggling rotation.	"You can see that the starters are finally coming around," he said. "If we turn the corner, with the offense and the bullpen playing the way they are, this team is capable of anything."	Verlander (4-2) won his third straight start, giving up four hits and four walks in 6 2/3 innings.	Sabathia (4-2) lost for just the third time in his last 13 road games, allowing six runs on nine hits in six innings.	"Verlander was throwing well, and I was trying to keep the score where it was," Sabathia said. "I just couldn't do it."	Cabrera and Brennan Boesch gave the Tigers a 3-0 lead with back-to-back homers down the right-field line in the fourth. Cabrera added a two-run double in the sixth.	"Cabrera's a great hitter, and he hurt us today," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "Boesch has swung the bat extremely well for them, and he kept doing it against us."	Left fielder Don Kelly preserved the shutout with an outstanding catch to end the eighth. The Yankees put two on against Zumaya, but Kelly grabbed Randy Winn's long fly just before running into the wall.	Detroit took the lead in the second on Gerald Laird's check-swing, RBI single.	After Cabrera and Boesch extended the lead, Jorge Posada hit a two-out double off Verlander in the sixth, but newly recalled Juan Miranda popped out to end the threat.	The Tigers then put the game away in the bottom half. Johnny Damon and Magglio Ordonez led off with singles and Cabrera doubled to deep center field.	Laird made it 6-0 with a two-out, RBI double -- his seventh hit in 15 career at-bats against Sabathia.	"I don't know what it is -- he's a great pitcher, but I've always seemed to have good at-bats against him," he said. "Obviously, my first hit was kind of a fluke, but I put a good swing on the double."	Zumaya replaced Verlander with two on and two out in the top of the seventh and got Mark Teixeira to fly out.	"We just didn't swing the bat well in Detroit," Girardi said. "You go through periods where you don't score a lot of runs, but you've still got to find a way to win some of those games, and we aren't doing that."	Game notes	Derek Jeter ended an 0-for-16 slump with an infield single to start the game. He stayed in the game after being hit in the right hand by a Verlander fastball in the fifth. ... Several Tigers got Mohawk haircuts between games of Wednesday's doubleheader, including most of the relief pitchers. Closer Jose Valverde was one of the few exceptions, despite originally telling the other relievers that he would go along. ... With Nick Swisher (biceps) on the bench, the Yankees called up Miranda from Triple-A Scranton Wilkes-Barre and optioned out infielder Kevin Russo. ... Yankees reliever Ivan Nova made his major league debut, pitching two shutout innings of relief.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

ST. LOUIS -- Bud Norris has been so dazzling against the St. Louis Cardinals, Albert Pujols referred to him as Chuck Norris earlier this week.	It seemed more of a compliment than slip of the tongue, especially after the 25-year-old righty kicked sand in the Cardinals' faces once again. This time, he pitched the Houston Astros to a 4-1 win Thursday for a three-game sweep.	In 28 career innings against St. Louis, Norris is 4-0 and has allowed one earned run.	"I've been lucky enough to have four good starts against these guys and I just hope to keep going," Norris said. "I know what I'm capable of when I do it right."	As the game progressed, the Cardinals' Ryan Ludwick thought Norris' fastball gained a few mph.	"He's pitched lights out every time against us," Ludwick said. "All of a sudden it was 95 and 96 and you could see the confidence building."	Hunter Pence hit a three-run home run for Houston, which posted its first sweep in St. Louis since taking a three-game series in April 2004. The Cardinals have lost seven of nine.	Houston's Lance Berkman extended his streak of reaching base to nine in a row with a double and two singles before grounding out in the eighth.	"I knew I hadn't made any outs but I didn't give it a whole lot of thought," Berkman said. "I knew I would make another one eventually, so I wasn't worried about it.	"I was hitting .190 coming in so I expected at some point I was going to get some hits," he said.	Norris (2-4) struck out eight and walked none in eight innings. He gave up one run and six hits. Though he's 8-7 with a 5.10 ERA lifetime, his ERA against St. Louis is 0.35.	"I think it's a very short time before we expect it from Bud all the time, with the stuff that he has," manager Brad Mills said. "He just threw the ball great."	Norris had lost three straight starts going into Thursday's game, allowing 16 earned runs in 13 2/3 innings. Norris thrived under a different catcher, Humberto Quintero.	The Astros scored all four runs in the third, perhaps taking advantage of Chris Carpenter's temper. Carpenter (4-1) and Carlos Lee had a staredown and then exchanged words after Lee popped out with two runners on base, leading to both benches and bullpens streaming on the field, although nothing got overheated.	Lee said he yelled in frustration but not at Carpenter and noted that Carpenter had been vocal after Berkman's RBI single the previous at-bat.	"I guess he's allowed to yell and say anything he wants because when Lance got that hit he was screaming and yelling and saying all kinds of stuff," Lee said. "He can get emotional and we can't get emotional as hitters?"	Carpenter blamed Lee for the rabble-rousing.	"I guess it's turned into we're all supposed to be best friends in this game," the pitcher said. "I said something, he said something. He kept coming at it. He's the one that caused everyone to come out, not me."	Pence was next up with two outs, and he hit his fifth homer to put Houston ahead 4-0. Pence thought the long inning for Carpenter helped more than lingering emotions.	"To be honest," Pence said, "it felt like the only pitch he threw me over the plate all day."	Berkman matched a career best by reaching in nine straight plate appearances. He had two homers during the streak, which fell four shy of the franchise record of 13 set by Bill Spiers in 1997.	Matt Holliday's RBI single in the seventh ended Norris' string of 24 innings without allowing an earned run against St. Louis. Pujols ran through third base coach Jose Oquendo's stop sign to score the run.	Matt Lindstrom worked the ninth for his ninth save in nine chances and 21st in a row dating to April 28, 2009.	Carpenter worked eight innings and retired his last 11 hitters, finishing with five strikeouts and three walks.	Game notes	 Houston's Felipe Paulino is 0-5 overall and 0-2 with an 18.47 career ERA against the Giants heading into Friday's start in San Francisco. ... Mills trotted out a repeat lineup for only the second time this season. Houston has used 32 different lineups, a major league high. ... Holliday had two hits and a walk. ... The Astros are 6-6 at home and 7-15 on the road, a disparity that Berkman called an "early-season anomaly."	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- After all the squawking about balking, Vladimir Guerrero left no doubt about the ending.	Guerrero lined a one-out, RBI single deep into the left-center field gap in the 12th inning Thursday to give Texas a 2-1 victory over the Oakland Athletics in a game in which one balk became a base hit and another led to the ejection of the Rangers catcher.	"It's really a weird situation," said C.J. Wilson, the Rangers starter who had the balks. "We won the game and that's really the most important thing."	Guerrero was 0-for-5 before his liner off closer Andrew Bailey (0-1) drove home Michael Young. Texas took two of the three in the series matching the AL West's top teams.	Jake Fox had three hits for Oakland, including a single in the fourth on a pitch from Wilson that umpires had signaled was a balk. But Fox hit the ball, so he wound up with a base hit and Wilson wasn't charged with a balk.	"Everybody moves up, the balk's ignored, and the runner can continue to try to advance and can be put out," umpire crew chief Tim Tschida said. "It's rare. It probably happens three, four times a year."	Wilson got called for another balk in the seventh, when he flinched his body while still on the rubber without delivering a pitch. Home plate umpire Bob Davidson immediately sent runner Josh Donaldson from second to third base.	"He said he started and stopped," manager Ron Washington said. "That was Balkin' Bob back there. That's all I can tell you."	Washington came out for an extended conversation with Davidson only after catcher Matt Treanor got ejected. Treanor was facing the mound when he got tossed for a conversation with the umpire that quickly escalated.	"I said something about the balk initially and it developed into something more personal after that," Treanor said. "He was grilling me basically and it comes down to I was telling him I'm not disrespecting you the way you're disrespecting me, I guess in so many words. ... I didn't feel like I deserved to be tossed."	Tschida said Treanor was ejected for "excessive arguing" after being told to stop. Washington wasn't thrown out of the game.	Tschida said Treanor used profanity in disputing the call.	"He balked. Matt's reaction immediately was he turned around," Tschida said. "He wouldn't let it go. Over the shoulder, he kept doing it, and that was it."	On the pitch before that, Cliff Pennington hit a fly down the right-field line that he and manager Bob Geren both thought was fair and would have scored Donaldson. Geren came out to question first base umpire Alfonso Marquez. Pennington eventually grounded out to end the inning.	Elvis Andrus led off the 12th with his fourth hit, but was then caught stealing. Young drew a walk and Josh Hamilton singled before Guerrero's winning hit.	Dustin Nippert (2-3), the fifth Rangers reliever and the loser in the 13-inning series opener Tuesday, worked around a leadoff single in the 12th.	A balk was being discussed even before the game, when Geren questioned the umpires' postgame decision the previous night that resulted in a call against Athletics pitcher Gio Gonzalez.	In Oakland's 10-1 loss Wednesday night, Gonzalez was initially charged with a throwing error after he awkwardly stepped off the rubber and threw wildly to the plate when Ian Kinsler suddenly broke from third base. About a half-hour after the game after viewing a replay, the umpires called the press box and said it was actually a balk.	After Fox's balky single in the fourth Thursday, Landon Powell walked to load the bases before Donaldson's single made it 1-all.	Andrus hit an RBI single in the third and extended his hitting streak to 13 games, the longest active in the majors.	Wilson allowed a run and four hits in seven innings. The left-hander's ERA dipped slightly from 1.51 to 1.48.	Oakland starter Ben Sheets pitched into the seventh, allowing a run and three singles with eight strikeouts. He had given up 17 runs over 7 1/3 innings his previous two starts on the road, when he became the first A's pitcher to give up at least eight earned runs in consecutive starts. He gave up only two runs in 6 1/3 innings Saturday at home.	"I picked up right where I left off the last start," he said. "I had good rhythm, made some key adjustments. I think six innings is a great start. I keep talking about getting deeper in the game."	Game notes	 Rangers RF Nelson Cruz will be activated from the 15-day disabled list Friday.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Zack Greinke's first win of the season came too late to save manager Trey Hillman's job.	The Kansas City Royals fired Hillman Thursday, announcing the move right after the AL Cy Young winner won for the first time in eight starts, 6-4 over the Cleveland Indians.	"There is never a right time for something like this to happen," Greinke said. "No matter what it's going to be awkward and it is going to feel like it's the wrong time."	Alberto Callaspo hit a three-run homer and the Royals roughed up David Huff (1-5) and gave Greinke (1-4) his most run support of the season to end Kansas City's seven-game losing streak. The hard-luck right-hander made the most of it, winning for the first time since September by allowing up three runs in six innings.	The 47-year-old Hillman was in his third season with Kansas City and went 152-207. Former Brewers manager Ned Yost, who had joined the Royals' front office in January, took over the 12-23 team.	Greinke will have little time to get acquainted with his new manager, who immediately stepped into the job.	"I'm guessing he was the manager of the Rockies, but I guess it could have been the Brewers because he looks like he would be a manager of the Brewers," Greinke said of Yost. "So that's how much I know about him."	He could consult with Jason Kendall. The catcher played for Yost in Milwaukee, and is impressed.	"Ned is a great manager, a great baseball person. He's very intense," Kendall said. "Ned is not playing for us either. We'll see what happens tomorrow. He's a very classy person, also. He's one of the guys you want to play for."	Robinson Tejeda allowed a run in the eighth inning on Asdrubal Cabrera's third hit, a run-scoring single, but Joakim Soria closed out the ninth for his eighth save in 10 chances.	Cleveland stranded 11 runners.	"Early in the game we could have done more damage, but we couldn't put the ball in play in that first inning. That's the type of guy [Greinke] is," Indians manager Manny Acta said. "After that we really fought and scratched and got those three runs. We had the opportunity to get the big hit to knock him out, but couldn't do it."	Greinke opened the season with no wins over his first seven starts, some of it his fault, some his teammates'.	"We need to start winning. If [managerial change] gets it done, that gets it done," Greinke said of Hillman's firing. "We've just got to start playing better."	The attention-shy right-hander has gotten the fourth-lowest run support in the AL at 2.4 runs per game, and the bullpen has blown leads in three games after he left the mound. But he's also had his share of rough moments, allowing three or more earned runs twice, including a loss to Texas on Friday in his last start.	The Indians scored three off him in one inning, getting run-scoring singles by Austin Kearns and Jhonny Peralta and an RBI double by Matt LaPorta in the third to go up 3-0.	This time, the Royals rallied.	Coming off 3 1/2 rough outings -- his seven runs in 2 2/3 innings against Detroit on Friday was washed out by rain -- Huff cruised through the first three innings before finding trouble in the fourth.	David DeJesus got it started with a leadoff single and Jose Guillen walked, setting up Callaspo's just-over-the-wall three-run shot to tie the game 3-all.	DeJesus gave the Royals their first lead the next inning, looping a run-scoring single in front of a diving Grady Sizemore, then Billy Butler hit the next pitch over the center fielder's head for a double that made it 5-3.	Greinke allowed one hit over the next three innings and was replaced by Tejeda after throwing 112 pitches. He gave up eight hits and struck out eight in his first start at Kauffman Stadium since April 5.	The Royals added a run off Huff in the sixth inning on Yuniesky Betancourt's slicing, run-scoring single to right. The big left-hander has now lost his last four starts, giving up four or more earned runs in each. He allowed six runs on nine hits in 5 2/3 innings.	Game notes	 Kendall was given the day off after sustaining what Hillman said was the worst in-game contusion he had ever seen. Kendall was hit on the left forearm by a pitch Wednesday night, but stayed in the game. X-rays were negative. ... Sizemore's average dropped to .215 after he went hitless in five at-bats.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.
