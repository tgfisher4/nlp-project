ATLANTA -- On a day when he was going to start, Jeff Karstens started out in the Pittsburgh bullpen.	He wasn't there long.	Karstens entered in relief after the pitcher who replaced him in the rotation, Charlie Morton, left the game with a tight left hamstring. The former starter gave up only one run in 4 2/3 innings, leading the Pirates past the Atlanta Braves 3-2 on Wednesday night.	"I did what I had to do to save the bullpen," Karstens said. "I'm used to throwing a lot."	Adam LaRoche had two RBIs and Craig Monroe pulled off some nifty baserunning to score a crucial run for the Pirates, who snapped a three-game losing streak and denied Atlanta its first four-game winning streak of the season.	Morton was called up from Triple-A Indianapolis to start against his former team, but the Pirates right-hander lasted only one inning. Karstens (3-4) took over and didn't allow a run until the sixth.	Asked if he expected to be called in so soon, Karstens quipped, "I don't think my arm expected it."	LaRoche put the Pirates ahead in the third against Jair Jurrjens (5-4), driving in a run with a forceout. Jason Jaramillo made it 2-0 with a two-out single.	After Atlanta closed to 2-1 on a near-homer by Brian McCann, Monroe's heads-up play on the base paths restored the two-run lead. He led off the seventh as a pinch-hitter and was grazed by Eric O'Flaherty's pitch. Monroe moved up on a groundout and was still at second with two outs when LaRoche hit a hard shot up the middle.	Second baseman Kelly Johnson made a diving stop and flipped to shortstop Yunel Escobar, trying for a force at second. The toss was late and Monroe never stopped, streaking around third while Escobar held the ball, not bothering to look toward the runner.	His delayed throw home was wild, and it wouldn't have gotten the speedy Monroe anyway.	"It wasn't heads-up," Braves manager Bobby Cox said, "and I don't know if anybody was yelling to tell him."	Escobar hustled out of the clubhouse after the game without speaking to reporters, leaving behind his teammates to explain what happened.	"He was probably assuming [Monroe] couldn't score," Johnson said. "Usually when you have the ball, you peek in to see where the runners are."	Matt Capps pitched the ninth for his 14th save, giving up a two-out homer to Garret Anderson.	Escobar, who had the game-winning hit Tuesday, doubled in the sixth and came around to score on McCann's towering drive to left-center. The ball struck the top of the wall, bounced back into play and was ruled a double by the umpiring crew.	Cox came out to question the call, and three umpires headed down a tunnel next to the Pirates dugout for the first video review in Turner Field history. They only needed about a minute to decide the call was right.	"It was real close, close enough to give it a look," said McCann, who thought from the crowd's reaction that he had hit a game-tying homer.	While both teams managed only six hits, the Pirates had plenty of chances. Atlanta walked seven and hit two batters, but Pittsburgh left the bases loaded three times.	Brandon Moss comes up twice in those situations, striking out in the first and grounding out in the seventh. Pinch-hitter Eric Hinske took a called third strike with the bases full in the ninth.	Morton got through the first, allowing one hit, but he headed straight to clubhouse after the inning. The Pirates said his hamstring tightened before the game and he couldn't pitch through it.	"It's very disappointing," said Morton, who was listed as day to day. "I was anxious to get back to Atlanta and get in some quality innings."	Morton was one of three prospects traded by the Braves last week for All-Star center fielder Nate McLouth. The right-hander was called up after Karstens, initially listed as Wednesday's starter, pitched in relief during Monday's 15-inning loss to the Braves.	"The guy has a rubber arm," LaRoche said. "When he's on, he's dangerous."	Jurrjens went six innings, giving up four hits and two runs while striking out seven. This was the sixth time in 13 starts that Atlanta has scored two runs or less.	"It's just a little frustrating," Jurrjens said. "This was a big game for us, and we let it get away."	Game notes	 The Braves have five three-game winning streaks this season. ... Greg Norton made his second straight start at first base for Atlanta and wound up falling over the mound after leaping to cut off a throw to the plate in the third. ... LaRoche has reached base safely in 20 of his last 23 games.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BALTIMORE -- Felix Hernandez turned in another solid outing on the mound and Jose Lopez picked up right where he left off at the plate.	It added up to a nice night for the Seattle Mariners.	Hernandez pitched seven sharp innings, Lopez homered twice and the Mariners beat the Baltimore Orioles 4-1 on Wednesday.	Lopez finished with three hits, raising his batting average over the last 11 games to .364 (16 for 44). He hit a solo drive in the second inning and a two-run shot in the sixth for his third career multihomer game.	"Sometimes when they [throw] inside, I move my hands quick to put the ball in play," Lopez said.	Hernandez (6-3) allowed just one run and seven hits to improve to 4-0 for his career at Camden Yards. Hernandez has a minuscule 0.95 ERA over his last four starts this season.	"Felix was outstanding," Mariners manager Don Wakamatsu said. "He's been that way for a couple of weeks now. He came out and competed. He got a little tired at the end. But he gave us enough for a chance to win."	Sean White pitched the eighth and David Aardsma got three outs for his 10th save.	The Mariners have allowed three runs or less in a franchise-record eight straight games.	Ichiro Suzuki doubled, walked and was hit by a pitch to reach base for the 39th straight game, the longest streak in the American League this season. He is batting .371 (124 for 334) in his career against the Orioles.	Brian Roberts had three hits and Matt Wieters went 2 for 4 for the Orioles.	Jeremy Guthrie (4-6) pitched well for Baltimore but was hurt again by the longball. He has allowed 16 homers this season, tops in the American League.	"It's a result of pitching, pitching in the zone and up. It happens," Guthrie said. "I think the track record is different, and I'm hoping for things to turn around."	Lopez's eighth homer in the sixth gave the Mariners a 4-1 lead. Yuniesky Betancourt drove in Seattle's other run with a groundout in the fourth.	Hernandez got out of a jam in the first after Baltimore put runners on first and second with no outs, retiring Nick Markakis, Aubrey Huff and Melvin Mora to get out of the inning.	"The scoring opportunities against him are not going to be plentiful, you're going to have to get to him early," Orioles manager Dave Trembley said. "We had the opportunity, we had the right guys up, he just made really good pitches and got good hitters out."	Wieters doubled and scored on Roberts' single in the fifth to cut Seattle's lead to 2-1. The Orioles put runners on second and third later in the inning but Huff flied to right to end the threat.	"The first inning they don't score a run, and now I say 'I got it,'" Hernandez said. "Now you're gonna pitch with more confidence and be better. We played some great defense today, we scored some runs and we win the game. That's the most important thing."	Guthrie gave up four runs, three earned, and six hits in six innings.	Game notes	Seattle CF Franklin Gutierrez left in the third inning with a bruised left knee. ... White has pitched 17 consecutive scoreless innings over his last 14 appearances.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CLEVELAND -- Gil Meche said he had awful stuff in the bullpen. Tell that to the Cleveland Indians.	Meche tied a career high with 11 strikeouts over seven innings and was backed by three Kansas City Royals home runs in a 9-0 win over the Indians on Wednesday night.	"I felt absolutely horrible warming up in the bullpen," Meche said. "It's weird. I just went out and tried to attack the [strike] zone and things fell in place."	Alberto Callaspo had a career-high four hits including his first career grand slam for Kansas City. The Royals also got two-run homers from Jose Guillen and Miguel Olivo to win for only the fourth time in their last 19 games.	"It's been a while," Guillen said of the offensive outburst. "Hopefully we learned something and will start playing real baseball again."	Kansas City averaged only 2.4 runs and was shut out four times in its previous 16 games.	Meche (3-5) allowed four hits and three walks in his first win in seven starts. Since beating Minnesota on May 3, the right-hander had gone 0-3 with a 4.02 ERA with the Royals losing each time. Meche improved to 19-6 in his career in the month of June. The 30-year-old has only a 62-67 record in all other months combined.	Guillen and Olivo each hit their seventh homers of the season in the Royals' four-run fourth off Carl Pavano (6-5). Callaspo connected off the right-hander to make it 9-0 in the fifth.	Pavano, coming off a 6-0 win in Chicago over the White Sox on Friday, allowed nine runs and 11 hits over 4 2/3 innings. He had gone 6-1 in his previous eight starts since May 1.	The right-hander blamed himself for losing focus after not getting off the mound quickly enough to cover first base on a ground single to the right side by Mark Teahen that loaded the bases for Callaspo.	"I didn't do my job," Pavano said. "That was a mental error that can't happen. Then I gave up the grand slam. That was pretty much the ballgame."	Cleveland dropped back into last place, a half-game behind the Royals in the AL Central. Kansas City, which led the division by three games on May 7, has gone a major league-worst 7-22 since.	"Through this whole nightmarish stretch, the good thing is we still played hard," Royals manager Trey Hillman said. "The results tonight were much better. We scored six of the nine with two outs. That's always good to see."	Sharp baserunning helped the Royals take a 1-0 lead in the second. Teahen drew a walk and was off with the pitch when Callaspo hit a line drive to right. Teahen reached third on the single and then scored on a sacrifice fly by Brayan Pena.	The Indians' best chance against Meche came in the fifth. They loaded the bases on two singles and a walk, but center fielder Willie Bloomquist made a nice running catch in right-center of Jamey Carroll's bid for extra bases to end the inning.	"It was good to seem Gil get out of the bases-loaded jam," Hillman said. "That was a real confidence booster."	Cleveland right fielder Shin-Soo Choo went 0-for-3 with two strikeouts against Meche.	"He didn't throw anything down the middle," Choo said. "Everything was on the outside corner or the inside corner or in the dirt. He was throwing mostly fastballs and had a great changeup. He was pretty good."	Ron Mahay and Kyle Farnsworth each needed only seven pitches to retire in the Indians in order in the eighth and ninth innings, respectively.	Game notes	The Indians didn't come close to matching what Cleveland outfielder Rocky Colavito did exactly 50 years ago on June 10. "The Rock" went 4-for-4 -- all home runs -- with six RBI in an 11-8 win at Baltimore. Colavito became the eighth of 15 players in history to hit four homers in a game. ... Cleveland has been shut out four times -- all at home, twice by Detroit and twice by the Royals. ... Indians catcher Kelly Shoppach fanned twice and has hit .133 (4-for-30) over his last nine games. ... Royals outfielder Coco Crisp didn't start against Pavano because his sore right shoulder bothers him hitting left-handed. The switch-hitter played Tuesday against left-hander Cliff Lee and is expected to start Thursday against left-hander Jeremy Sowers. ... Indians outfielder Grady Sizemore, on the disabled list since May 31 with an inflamed left elbow, is scheduled for an MRI on Monday.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

WASHINGTON -- Jonny Gomes sat in Cincinnati's clubhouse and watched the end of three different baseball games on TV while he waited for a rain delay to end.	When the Reds finally got back on the field, he washed away Washington's rally with one clutch hit.	Gomes put Cincinnati ahead with a pinch-hit RBI double in the 12th inning and the Reds won 4-2 on Wednesday night after the Nationals tied in the ninth following the long delay.	"I don't think there was any method to the madness on that one," Gomes said. "I went in there and took a swing -- luckily it fell."	The Reds were leading 2-0 and had perfect closer Francisco Cordero on the mound when the rain came in the bottom of the ninth. When they returned to the field more than two hours later, the Nationals pushed across two runs to send the game to extra innings.	Jay Bruce led off the 12th with a walk and Alex Gonzalez reached when Ron Villone (3-1) botched his sacrifice attempt. Bruce moved to third on a passed ball.	Jason Bergmann got Ryan Hanigan to ground into a double play but Gomes followed with his double into left field. Jerry Hairston Jr. added an RBI single.	"The bottom line is that we won. That's not how we drew it up, that's not how you would have scripted it," manager Dusty Baker said. "We were out here a little later, a little longer than we planned."	Villone gave up his first run of the year. He entered with 17 scoreless innings this season.	Nick Masset (4-0) pitched two innings for the win and David Weathers finished for his first save.	The woeful Nationals put together a nice rally after the 2 hour, 10 minute delay in the ninth. When the game started again, less than 100 fans remained in the seats, gathered in the rows behind each dugout.	Cordero issued a leadoff walk to Elijah Dukes and had a 2-2 count on Josh Willingham when rain sent the teams off the field. When the game resumed, Cordero walked Willingham to put runners at first and second.	After Ronnie Belliard struck out, Josh Bard and pinch-hitter Alberto Gonzalez had RBI singles to tie it at 2.	Cordero had converted all 15 of his save opportunities this season -- it was his first blown save since last July 21 against the San Diego Padres.	"He said he felt great," Baker said. "That's similar to your closer throwing both ends of a doubleheader. He didn't throw that much."	It was one more tough result for the Nationals, who are 0-8 in extra innings this season. Washington has lost three in a row and 12 of 14 overall.	"The extra-inning thing carries back from the days when our bullpen was struggling," manager Manny Acta said. "But right now, our bullpen is throwing a lot better, and we just haven't been able to get the big hit."	Aaron Harang pitched 7 2/3 shutout innings and Bruce had a two-run homer for Cincinnati. Harang allowed five hits, walked three and struck out two.	Shairon Martis went seven innings for the Nationals, allowing just three hits.	Hairston batted leadoff for the Reds. CF Willy Taveras, trying to work his way out of a slump, moved to the second spot. Baker called the move temporary. ... The Nationals signed RHP Drew Storen, the 10th overall pick in the draft. The deal is worth more than $1.5 million. ... Willingham made his first start since missing six games with a stomach virus. Usually a left fielder, it also was his first career start in right. Willingham committed an error in the third when Hairston's liner bounced out of his glove.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- The Tampa Bay Rays were hardly concerned about their poor history against John Lackey.	"That was another time," manager Joe Maddon said Wednesday night after Carlos Pena and Willy Aybar homered to help the defending AL champions beat Lackey and the Los Angeles Angels 9-5. "That was against the Devil Rays."	The Angels right-hander had won nine of 10 previous decisions against the Rays, though most of the damage was done before last season, when Tampa Bay dropped the "Devil" from its nickname and posted its first winning record.	"I'm not denigrating John in any way. It's just about we're a different group right now," Maddon said. "The guys here have no interest in that negative history."	Pena hit a solo homer in the third inning and Aybar added a two-run shot off Lackey (1-2) for a 9-5 lead in the fifth.	Aybar also had an RBI single during a five-run second during which the Rays began the inning with four straight hits, three of them well-placed grounders that got through the right side of the infield.	"Kind of everything that could happen wrong happened. Good pitches, they managed to get infield hits. I throw a bad pitch, and they were hitting those hard," Lackey said. "If a couple of those ground balls are at somebody, it's a different game."	The Rays, who ended a three-game skid that featured a lack of timely hitting, rallied from a 3-0 deficit to build a 7-3 lead for Jeff Niemann. But the rookie right-hander lasted just 3 2/3 innings.	Lance Cormier (1-1) pitched 2 1/3 scoreless innings for the win. Jason Isringhausen, Joe Nelson and Dan Wheeler finished up, holding the Angels to one hit -- Vladimir Guerrero's ninth-inning triple -- over the last three innings.	Chone Figgins had a two-run triple for Los Angeles, but also committed a costly throwing error. Gary Matthews Jr., Bobby Abreu and Juan Rivera also drove in runs for the Angels, who stranded nine baserunners while wasting several scoring opportunities.	Coming off the best performance of his career -- a two-hit, complete-game shutout of Kansas City -- and pitching on extra rest, Niemann allowed five runs and seven hits.	"He just could not get into any kind of rhythm," Maddon said.	Aybar, Gabe Gross, Dioner Navarro and Carl Crawford drove in runs in the second inning for the Rays. A fifth run scored on a wild pitch by Lackey, who was 9-1 with a 2.36 ERA in 11 career start against Tampa Bay before Wednesday night.	Pena hit his 18th homer in the third, and the Rays went up 7-3 when Ben Zobrist scored on Figgins' two-out error. After Los Angeles pulled within two on Abreu's sacrifice fly and Rivera's RBI single in the fourth, Aybar restored the four-run lead with his fifth homer.	Lackey allowed nine runs and 11 hits, even though he felt he threw the ball well until the fifth inning.	"I definitely expect more of myself," said Lackey, who spent the first six weeks of the season on the disabled list with a strained right forearm. "I don't believe in moral victories. You either win or you lose."	Game notes	 Los Angeles CF Torii Hunter, slowed by a groin strain, was out of the lineup. The Angels didn't want Hunter, who will start Thursday, to play three straight days on artificial turf. ... Rays DH Pat Burrell (neck strain) could return this weekend, and SS Jason Bartlett (sprained left ankle) might be back early next week. ... Los Angeles manager Mike Scioscia said setup man Scot Shields' stay on the 15-day disabled list with an injured left knee remains open-ended. ...

BOSTON -- Mark Teixeira couldn't keep the New York Yankees from losing their eighth straight game to the Boston Red Sox -- even with four hits, including his AL-leading 19th homer of the year.	Now the Yankees' top pitching prize will have to try to stop the skid.	Mike Lowell homered off struggling Yankees starter Chien-Ming Wang and Kevin Youkilis also connected to help give Boston a 6-5 victory on Wednesday night and a 7-0 record against New York this year. Wang was the second straight Yankees starter to leave after getting just eight outs, a trend CC Sabathia will try to reverse when he pitches against Brad Penny in the series finale on Thursday.	"Hopefully, we can sweep them again tomorrow," said Tim Wakefield, who beat the Yankees for the second straight time after losing to them in nine of his previous 10 decisions.	Teixeira spurned the Red Sox in the offseason to sign a seven-year, $161 million contract with their rivals -- the biggest for a position player on the free-agent market. Sabathia got the only bigger deal over the winter: eight years and $180 million.	The big left-hander will try to stop the skid and save a bullpen that couldn't rescue either A.J. Burnett or Wang (0-4) when they couldn't get out of the third inning. Yankees manager Joe Girardi would not commit to giving Wang, whose ERA dropped from 14.46 to 14.34, another turn in the rotation.	"I'm not ready to make that decision right now," Girardi said. "We're seven minutes after the game, so it's something we'll discuss. I'll sleep on it. In five days, somebody will be out there."	Wakefield (8-3) allowed eight hits in six innings and improved to 5-0 at Fenway Park in five starts this year. The knuckleballer handed a 6-3 lead to a bullpen that had given up just one earned run in the last 17 1/3 innings. But Ramon Ramirez gave up back-to-back homers to Johnny Damon and Teixeira in the seventh.	Hideki Okajima got four outs, and Jonathan Papelbon pitched the ninth for his 15th save.	"It's a tough bullpen, one of the toughest I've ever seen," Teixeira said.	Boston, which also beat the Yankees in their last matchup of the 2008 season, has its longest winning streak against New York since 1912, when Fenway Park opened and the Yankees were still the Highlanders.	"We're moving guys over, we're getting big two-out hits, and when you do those little things like that and you're playing good baseball you're going to win ballgames -- regardless of it's the Yankees or anybody else," Papelbon said. "We just happen to be playing good baseball against them right now and we've got to keep this momentum."	Wang was restored to the rotation after two scoreless relief appearances, but his troubles soon returned. He gave up five runs over 4 2/3 innings in a no-decision against Texas last Thursday and gave up four runs and six hits versus Boston.	Game notes	Teixeira hit right-handed against Wakefield. Nick Swisher hit left-handed and bunted, then right-handed and walked. ... Among Boston's picks in the draft were right-hander Luke Bard, the brother of Red Sox pitcher Daniel Bard. The Yankees grabbed first baseman Luke Murton, the brother of Rockies outfielder Matt Murton. ... Boston center fielder Jacoby Ellsbury was off for the second straight night while nursing a sore shoulder. ... Yankees outfielder Xavier Nady (15-day DL, right elbow) will be with the team on Friday and work out over the weekend. ... Swisher misplayed a fly ball for a ground-rule double in the second inning and then went over the wall into the stands after a foul ball. ... Wang has left his five starts trailing by a combined score of 27-3. ... New York's Hideki Matsui ended an 0-for-16 slump with a second-inning double. ... Burnett lasted just 2 2/3 in the Yankees' series-opening loss on Tuesday.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

NEW YORK -- Jayson Werth took a big gamble that paid off for the Philadelphia Phillies.	The right fielder saved his team with a diving catch, moments before Chase Utley's second homer of the game sent Philadelphia to a 5-4 victory over the New York Mets in 11 innings Wednesday night.	With a speedy runner on first and two outs in the 10th, Werth made a sensational grab of David Wright's sinking liner in the right-center gap.	If the ball gets by him, Fernando Martinez probably scores the winning run. But rather than play it safe and glove the ball on a hop, Werth went all out.	"It was just one of those deals where I thought it was worth it," he said. "When the ball came out of the lights I thought, ohh, it's much closer than I expected. When I dove for it, I didn't expect to catch it."	Somehow he did, and then Utley led off the 11th with his 15th home run.	His third homer in two nights that nestled into the right-field corner at spacious Citi Field came on the second pitch from Bobby Parnell (2-1), handing the hard-throwing rookie his first big league loss.	It's the only home run Parnell has allowed in 29 career innings.	"Fastball in. The pitch he was looking for," Parnell said. "He's a good hitter. That's the pitch he wanted and that's what he wanted to do with it."	Utley had a testy exchange earlier in the game with Mets starter Mike Pelfrey, who got annoyed when the slugger stepped out of the box.	"I was ready to make a pitch and he called timeout," Pelfrey said. "I got upset and told him to get in the box. I don't even know the guy. I was just trying to compete and execute a pitch.	"I got caught up in the moment. I probably shouldn't have said anything."	Utley downplayed the whole thing.	"It seemed like he got a little frustrated. I wasn't trying to frustrate him. I was just trying to have a good at-bat," Utley said.	New York built a three-run lead against World Series MVP Cole Hamels, who faced the Mets for the first time since calling them "choke artists" in the offseason -- the latest in a series of verbal barbs between the NL East rivals.	But the Phillies rallied to tie it 4-all in the seventh against Pelfrey and the New York bullpen. The Mets have lost six times this season after leading by at least three runs.	Chan Ho Park (2-1) worked two scoreless innings for the win -- with help from Werth. Subbing for injured closer Brad Lidge, Ryan Madson got three quick outs for his third save.	The Mets stranded a season-high 16 runners, eight from innings seven through 10. Still, they nearly won it in the 10th on Wright's liner.	"If he hadn't of caught it, the guy would have scored," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said.	Wright, who had three hits and two stolen bases, yanked off his helmet in frustration at first base after Werth's diving catch. Wright also made a key error in the seventh.	Jimmy Rollins went 0 for 5 with an RBI for the Phillies in his return to the leadoff spot after two games batting sixth. Philadelphia is 6-3 on a 10-game trip, improving to a major league-best 22-9 away from home.	New York dropped to 18-10 at Citi Field with only its fourth loss in 16 home games. The Mets are 4-2 against Philadelphia this season, but they trail the first-place Phillies by three games.	It was Philadelphia's first win in four games at New York's new home.	"Every game we play with them is big. It's a rivalry. Everything about it is good," Manuel said. "We like to play them and they like to play us. We're pretty even teams."	Coming off a five-hit shutout of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Hamels allowed four runs in five innings. He gave up 11 hits, matching a career high.	"I have better things to worry about in my life than to worry about Cole Hamels and what he said," Mets outfielder Carlos Beltran said.	Game notes	Pelfrey doubled off the base of the left-field fence and scored in the third, then had a bloop RBI single in a three-run fourth. ... Utley has 17 career multihomer games, including two this season.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.
