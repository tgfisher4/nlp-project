CHICAGO --  Gio Gonzalez is quite comfortable with the Milwaukee Brewers.	After a strange start to the season, that's a big deal for the veteran left-hander.	Gonzalez pitched two-hit ball into the sixth inning and Ryan Braun homered, helping the Brewers beat the Chicago Cubs 7-0 on Friday for their season-high seventh straight victory.	"We pitched really good again," manager Craig Counsell said. "Our guys did a great job, and it started with Gio."	Gonzalez finished last year with Milwaukee, helping the Brewers make it to the NL Championship Series. But he was a free agent up until he signed a minor league contract with the Yankees in March.	After opting out of his deal with New York, he returned to a Milwaukee team in need of some rotation help. It's worked out quite well so far, with Gonzalez (1-0) recording a 1.69 ERA over his first three starts.	"I'm just happy to put on a big league uniform," Gonzalez said, "and I'm happy to do it with the Brewers. They've been great to me."	Yasmani Grandal and Jesus Aguilar each drove in two runs for Milwaukee, which moved into a virtual tie with Chicago for the NL Central lead. Hernan Perez also contributed with a couple of nice plays at second base.	The Brewers (24-16) moved a season-high eight games over .500 in their first visit to Wrigley Field since they topped the Cubs 3-1 in the division tiebreaker game Oct. 1.	Chicago (22-14) had won 10 of 11, but it was shut down by Gonzalez and five relievers on a windy, cool day. Quintana (4-2) allowed three runs and four hits in 6 2/3 innings in his first loss since April 5.	"It was just a bit off for the offense today in terms of finishing it off," Cubs third baseman David Bote said.	Braun put Milwaukee ahead to stay with his eighth homer with two out in the fourth. Quintana had retired 10 in a row before Braun drove a 1-0 pitch over the wall in center, answering the usual round of boos that chase the 2011 NL MVP whenever he visits Wrigley.	It was Braun's 38th homer against Chicago, his second-highest total against a single team. He has connected in each of his three games against the Cubs this year.	"Wrigley is always such a special place to play," Braun said. "It's loud. It's always packed. It's energetic. You play in some of these ballparks now with the teams that aren't competing, and it can be really empty at times. It's not an enjoyable atmosphere to play in as a competitor. This place is always special. It's always fun."	Milwaukee added two more in each of the final three innings. Grandal singled in Orlando Arcia and Aguilar walked with the bases loaded in the ninth.	Gonzalez struck out three and walked three in 5 2/3 innings. He got some help in the third when Perez robbed Albert Almora Jr. of a potential run-scoring single with a diving play on a grounder up the middle.	"He kept us off balance, made pitches," Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. "We made a couple of well-contacted balls but for the most part, not."	DEFENSIVELY SPEAKING	Chicago hurt itself with a couple of fielding miscues. Grandal slid home safely when first baseman Anthony Rizzo made an ill-advised throw to the plate after making a diving stop on Mike Moustakas' grounder in the seventh. Catcher Willson Contreras had a costly throwing error in the eighth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: CF Lorenzo Cain was shaken up after he fouled a ball off his lower left leg in the sixth inning, but he stayed in the game. ... RHP Chase Anderson (right middle finger laceration) was scheduled to throw a bullpen session Friday. He is expected to make at least one rehab start before returning to the Brewers.	Cubs: INF Daniel Descalso (sore left ankle) could return to the starting lineup this weekend. Descalso has been limited to pinch hitting since he got hurt last Saturday. "He's doing well," Maddon said. "He's making a lot of progress."	UP NEXT	Brewers right-hander Zach Davies and Cubs left-hander Cole Hamels get the ball on Saturday. Davies (4-0, 1.56 ERA) pitched into the eighth inning in a 3-2 victory over the New York Mets on Sunday. Hamels (3-0, 3.38 ERA) is coming off three consecutive no-decisions.	---	Jay Cohen can be reached at https://twitter.com/jcohenap	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

BALTIMORE --  Concerned about his swing and eager to do something about it, Mike Trout put in some extra time in the batting cage in an effort to get back in a groove.	The results were on full display against the Baltimore Orioles on Friday night.	Trout homered and drove in three runs, scored twice and drew his major league leading 36th walk to help the Los Angeles Angels roll to an 8-3 victory.	After hitting only one home run since April 9, Trout worked with the team's hitting coaches while the Angels were in Detroit.	"He was in the cage for about 45 minutes or an hour," manager Brad Ausmus said. "They kind of ironed some stuff out. He definitely felt a difference."	Before the game, Trout met up with 7-year-old Baltimore native Gavin Edelson, who met with Trout at Camden Yards last year while carrying a sign that read "Mike Trout is my idol."	Edelson was at Friday's game, meeting his favorite player before the game and receiving one of his bats. Edelson had a request for Trout: Hit a home run.	Maybe it was that extra batting practice, or perhaps Trout just wanted to do something for the kid. Either way, his eighth homer of the season snapped a 1-1 tie and propelled the Angels to victory.	"I was trying to put the ball in play, hit the ball hard," Trout said. "It's Baltimore, the ball goes a little bit better than many other places."	Trout still isn't entirely happy with his swing, but he's not complaining, either.	"I'm trying to fix it. It's coming," he said. "Obviously, a double tonight and the home run, just got to keep that same feeling in consecutive at-bats. Some pitches, I don't feel it."	Andrelton Simmons had four hits, two RBI and scored twice for the Angels, who held an 8-2 lead when the game was stopped by a driving rainstorm just prior to the start of the seventh inning. After a delay of 1 hour, 49 minutes, only a couple hundred fans remained from the original crowd of 14,495.	"It felt like the Florida State League a little bit," Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. "It's so weird when you can hear everything. You can hear the other side and you can hear the fans yelling in the outfield."	The Angels returned to complete their second straight lopsided victory, an encore to their 13-0 win at Detroit on Thursday.	Trevor Cahill (2-3) pitched six innings, allowing two runs and four hits to win for the first time in five starts since April 8.	Trey Mancini and Chris Davis homered for the Orioles, whose 5-14 home record is the worst in the big leagues.	Mancini staked Baltimore to a 1-0 lead in the first inning with his seventh home run , the major-league leading 13th allowed by Cahill this season. Two nights earlier, Mancini hit a drive to center that didn't quite travel as far and was snagged by Boston's Jackie Bradley Jr., who reached over the wall to prevent the Orioles from winning in the 11th inning.	"He was yelling that when he came into the dugout, `Catch that one!' Hyde said.	Los Angeles pulled even against Dan Straily (1-3) in the second on an RBI triple by Kole Calhoun. Trout's eighth home run, on a 3-2 pitch, made it 3-1 in the third.	It was 3-2 before the Angels batted around in a five-run fifth. After Trout doubled in a run and Simmons hit a two-run single , Brian Goodwin drove in a run with a double and scored on a single by Calhoun.	0 FOR OHTANI	In his fourth game since returning from elbow surgery, Angels DH Shohei Ohtani went 0 for 5 and struck out twice.	The 2018 AL Rookie of the Year is off to a slow start at the plate. He's 2 for 16 (.125) with seven strikeouts.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: LHP Andrew Heaney, sidelined since early March due to elbow inflammation, was scheduled to throw on Friday against hitters in an extended spring training game in Arizona. ... RHP J.C. Ramirez (elbow) had no issues following a two-inning stint in a simulated game on Thursday. ... OF Michael Hermosillo (sports hernia) has resumed baseball activities but mostly swinging in the batting cage.	Orioles: LHP Richard Bleier (left shoulder tendinitis) pitched a scoreless inning for Double-A Bowie. The 32-year-old got the win with Class A Frederick on Tuesday night, his first minor league appearance since May 2017.	UP NEXT	Angels: Matt Harvey (1-3, 6.94 ERA) starts against Baltimore for the first time in his career Saturday afternoon. He's allowed at least five runs in four of seven starts this year.	Orioles: Dylan Bundy (1-4, 5.30) tries to build on his last outing, when he pitched 7 1/3 shutout innings Saturday against Tampa Bay.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

TORONTO --  The Toronto Blue Jays took full advantage of a new opponent in town and turned their tough stretch around.	Randal Grichuk hit a three-run homer, Teoscar Hernandez added a solo shot and the Blue Jays snapped a season-worst, five-game losing streak with a 4-3 win over the Chicago White Sox on Friday night.	Grichuk's two-out blast in the first inning was his sixth of the season and came off starter Dylan Covey (0-2). The homer gave the Blue Jays more runs with one swing than they scored in a three straight losses to Minnesota earlier this week. Toronto was shut out in the first two games and lost 9-1 in Wednesday's series finale.	"I think the off day was big for us," Toronto's Justin Smoak said, referring to Thursday's break in the schedule. "Minnesota are the hottest team in baseball right now, so it was a tough series. We really had nothing going against them. To get a couple of big home runs tonight and get runs early, that always helps."	The sweep at the hands of the Twins gave the Blue Jays eight losses in nine games.	"To get them out of town was a good feeling, and get somebody else up there," reliever Daniel Hudson said. "It was a big win for the team tonight, for sure."	Hernandez added a leadoff homer in the second inning, his third of the season. Hernandez hadn't homered since April 18, at Minnesota.	Covey allowed four runs and three hits in 4 2/3 innings. He was upset at himself for walking Smoak and Rowdy Tellez before Grichuk's drive.	"I'm OK with giving up a solo home run here and there, but I've got to cut back on those two-out walks," Covey said. "Different ball game if those guys aren't on when they hit the homer."	Toronto's scheduled starter, right-hander Clay Buchholz, was scratched and placed on the 10-day injured list because of a sore shoulder. Right-hander Daniel Hudson opened for Toronto, the first time this season the Blue Jays used an opener.	Hudson allowed a run in the first on back-to-back doubles by Yoan Moncada and Jose Abreu.	Chicago's Tim Anderson hit a solo homer off Sam Gaviglio in the fifth, and the White Sox cut it to 4-3 on Leurys Garcia's RBI groundout in the seventh.	Joe Biagini (2-1) came on and struck out Moncada for the final out of the seventh, stranding a runner at third. Biagini pitched the eighth before Ken Giles got Charlie Tilson on a fly ball to the warning track for the final out for his ninth save in 10 chances.	Giles retired the side in order for the fifth straight appearance and reached 100 saves for his career.	"That's definitely very special to me to get that number," Giles said.	Blue Jays prospect Vladimir Guerrero batted second, the highest he has hit in the order since his promotion to the majors. Guerrero grounded into a double play in the first, grounded out in the third, fouled out in the fifth and flied out in the seventh. The hitless performance dropped his average to .146.	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox: OF Eloy Jimenez (right ankle) ran the bases before the game. He's expected to do so one more time over the weekend before beginning a rehab stint.	Blue Jays: Left-hander Thomas Pannone, who was optioned to Buffalo on Thursday, was recalled after Buchholz's injury.  ... Buchholz's injury list stint is retroactive to May 9.	FLIP OUT	Anderson did not flip his bat after his homer. Last month, Anderson and Grichuk exchanged comments on social media after Grichuk took issue with excessive celebrations of home runs.	LOOK OUT!	Guerrero Jr. lined a foul ball into the seats down the left field line during his final at bat. The hard-hit ball narrowly missed an infant and appeared to strike a young girl, who was able to walk out of her section for additional treatment. Her condition was not immediately known.	ROSTER REPORT:	White Sox: Minor league OF Preston Tucker was released and signed with a team in the Korean Baseball Organization. ... Triple-A Charlotte acquired OF Paulo Orlando in a trade with the Los Angeles Dodgers' organization.	Blue Jays: Toronto selected RHP Javy Guerra from Triple-A. OF Socrates Brito was designated for assignment. Acquired from San Diego on April 2, Brito hit .077 in 17 games, striking out 17 times in 39 at bats. ... The Blue Jays made a trade with Pittsburgh, acquiring minor league OF Patrick Kivlehan for cash.	UP NEXT	White Sox: RHP Ivan Nova (1-3, 7.04) will make his eighth start of the season and the sixth away from home. He's 5-7 with a 5.66 ERA in 17 career games against Toronto.	Blue Jays: RHP Marcus Stroman (1-5, 2.96) allowed a season-worst six runs in his previous start on May 6 against Minnesota. He's 2/3 with a 5.45 ERA in seven career starts against the White Sox.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

NEW YORK -- Back home from a frustrating road trip, the New York Mets immediately busted out of their offensive funk against the worst team in the majors.	Amed Rosario hit a grand slam during an eight-run outburst that marked the Mets' biggest first inning in three decades, and New York rolled to an 11-2 rout of the Miami Marlins on Friday night.	"It was great. It was a lot of fun to kind of break out as a team," Michael Conforto said. "It's something we've been waiting for."	Conforto and Jeff McNeil also homered for the previously slumping Mets, who set a season best with 15 hits and matched their high for runs. Zack Wheeler (3-2) struck out 11 over seven innings, reaching double digits for the third time in four outings.	Earlier in the day, manager Mickey Callaway met with Mets chief operating officer Jeff Wilpon and general manager Brodie Van Wagenen.	"This meeting had a different focus. This meeting was about, how can we be better? How can we get going in the right direction?" Callaway said. "None of us are satisfied with what's been going on to this point.	"We talked about a lot and we understand that things have to be better."	Right off the bat, they were.	After totaling only 15 runs during a 1-5 trip to Milwaukee and San Diego, the Mets broke loose against Pablo Lopez (2-5) and the Marlins (10-28). New York sent 13 batters to the plate in the first, with J.D. Davis and Robinson Cano each getting two of the team's eight hits.	The first run scored on Lopez's wild pitch. Slow-footed Wilson Ramos legged out a dribbler up the third-base line for an RBI single, and Brandon Nimmo drew a bases-loaded walk.	Rosario, batting eighth, sent the next pitch just over the right-center fence for his first major league slam -- instantly giving him a career-high four RBIs.	Wheeler struck out, making him the first batter retired by Lopez. But when Cano added a two-out RBI single, the Mets (18-20) had their largest first inning since they also scored eight times at Philadelphia on June 16, 1989.	"You don't see that type of inning very often," Callaway said. "I think everybody took a deep breath after that. Like, OK, we can still score runs."	The inning could have been even worse for Lopez, too, if right fielder Brian Anderson hadn't wheeled around to make a spectacular throw that nabbed McNeil trying to go first to third on Davis' single for the first out.	McNeil led off with a bunt single, diving into first to evade a tag, and reached safely four times. Conforto was 3-for-3 with three runs and reached safely all five times up. Davis finished with three hits.	"Now is as good a time as any time to start making our move," Conforto said. "We're going to put it all together here very soon."	Conforto homered into the right-field upper deck leading off the second. McNeil connected in the third against the 23-year-old Lopez, who was coming off six shutout innings against Atlanta and had not allowed an earned run in two of his previous three starts.	"Didn't look like he had life on his fastball. Didn't look like he was locating very well. Things got snowballing and usually that's tough," Miami manager Don Mattingly said. "So, it was one of those nights."	Lopez, who beat Mets ace Jacob deGrom 5-2 in his major league debut June 30 last year, gave up 10 runs and 10 hits over three innings, easily the worst of his 18 career starts.	"Everything happened very quick. I kept falling behind," Lopez said. "You can only get better after this."	BEEN A WHILE	The Mets scored more runs in the first inning than they had during an entire game since a 9-0 win over the Phillies on April 23. New York mustered only 16 runs over its previous eight games -- one of which went 18 innings.	The only other time in franchise history they hung a snowman in the first at home was July 12, 1979, against the Dodgers. The club record is nine first-inning runs at San Francisco in August 1988.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: 1B-OF Garrett Cooper (bruised left hand) is moving from Class A Jupiter to Triple-A New Orleans on his rehab assignment. ... RHP Julian Fernandez (Tommy John surgery) is scheduled to throw 20 pitches of live batting practice Saturday.	Mets: The team decided against activating veteran infielder Jed Lowrie from the injured list Friday, as originally anticipated. Lowrie got hurt early in spring training and has been sidelined all season because of a capsule sprain in his left knee. He was 1-for-7 with Class A St. Lucie and 1-for-16 at Triple-A Syracuse during the first six games of his rehab assignment. Callaway said the Mets planned to re-evaluate Saturday. Lowrie went 3-for-4 with a home run and a walk Friday night for Syracuse. He played nine innings at third base. ... LHP Steven Matz is slated to throw a bullpen Saturday, an important step after he received an injection of cortisone and lidocaine for his aching left forearm early this week. Matz was placed on the 10-day injured list Thursday, retroactive to May 5, with radial nerve discomfort, and the Mets hope he can return to the rotation next week.	UP NEXT	Marlins: Sandy Alcantara (1-3, 4.93 ERA) pitches Saturday night, his fourth assignment against the Mets in 14 major league starts. The 23-year-old right-hander is 0-3 in his last five outings overall.	Mets: National League Cy Young Award winner deGrom (2-4, 3.60 ERA) has lost four straight decisions, and New York hasn't scored in either of his past two games. In his second outing this season, deGrom struck out a career-high 14 over seven shutout innings at Miami. Still, he is just 5-6 with a 3.36 ERA in 17 starts against the Marlins.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  In a season full of strange twists so far, the New York Yankees turned a couple of odd hops into their latest victory.	Domingo German became the majors' first seven-game winner, Gio Urshela got a key hit set up by a pair of bizarre bounces and the Yankees beat the Tampa Bay Rays 4-3 on Friday night.	The injury-filled Yankees pulled within a half-game of the AL East-leading Rays in the first of 19 meetings between the teams this season. New York has won 15 of 20 while often relying on its non-All-Stars -- the team currently has a dozen players on the injured list, including Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton and Luis Severino.	"They're focused everyday but also playing the game with some joy and having fun doing it," Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. "It's a close-knit group that's playing an unselfish brand of baseball."	German (7-1) was matched up against Tyler Glasnow (6-1), who left in the sixth inning with right forearm tightness.	"I don't really know what's going on right now," said Glasnow, who will have an MRI Saturday. "I'm just going to be optimistic. It wasn't a pop or anything crazy. I just felt tightness for a couple pitches."	Glasnow struck out nine in 5 1/3 innings. He signaled for a trainer after striking out Gleyber Torres and was pulled.	German allowed three runs and five hits over five innings. Aroldis Chapman, the fourth Yankees reliever, worked the ninth for his ninth save.	Home runs by Austin Meadows and Ji-Man Choi gave the Rays a 3-2 lead entering the sixth.	Gary Sanchez opened the Yankees sixth with an infield single on a popup that struck the highest of four overhanging catwalks -- approximately 185 feet high -- and fell in the infield as Tampa Bay players scrambled to catch the carom. The park's ground rules say such balls are in play.	"Fortunately deflected far enough that we got a break there," Boone said.	It's the fifth fair ball to hit the "A" ring at Tropicana Field -- which opened in 1998 -- and second that resulted in a hit.	Clint Frazier followed with a single and Torres fanned, finishing Glasnow. Emilio Pagan relieved and Miguel Andujar hit a grounder that took a crooked hop off the mound and went for an infield single that loaded the bases. Urshela then delivered a two-run single for a 4-3 lead.	"Probably our MVP at this point," Yankees reliever Adam Ottavino said.	On Thursday night, Urshela entered in the seventh for defense and hit a two-run single in the eighth of a 3-1 victory over Seattle.	The Rays loaded the bases on two walks and a bunt single in the seventh. But Ottavino escaped by striking out Tommy Pham and getting Choi to hit a grounder off the pitcher's leg that second baseman DJ LeMahieu fielded, raced to second for an out and threw to first to complete a nifty double play.	"I was fired up," Ottavino said. "It was a grind of an inning."	Meadows, reinstated from the 10-day injured list after missing 15 games with a strained right thumb, hit a two-run homer and Choi added a solo shot two batters later off German as the Rays went up in the fifth. German had allowed just two homers overall in six previous starts.	New York took a 2-0 lead in the first when LeMahieu scored on rookie Nick Ciuffo's passed ball and Torres' RBI single.	Torres was hit on the right elbow by a pitch in the eighth inning but stayed in the game.	"We'll have to see what kind of swelling is in there," Boone said. "But hoping that he avoided something serious."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: LHP Jordan Montgomery (Tommy John surgery) will increase from 30 to 35 pitches and start incorporating curveballs in his next bullpen session Tuesday. "I'm starting to kind of see some light at the end of the tunnel in the bullpens when I'm throwing the ball and it's going where I want it to," Montgomery said. ... LHP James Paxton (left knee inflammation) is playing catch.	Rays: 3B Matt Duffy (left hamstring strain) is scheduled to resume a rehab assignment with Class A Charlotte Monday.	CHAD'S COMING	Boone said reliever Chad Green could rejoin the team from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre this weekend. He was optioned April 23 to work on mechanics after going 0-2 with a 16.43 ERA in 10 games.	UP NEXT	Yankees LHP CC Sabathia (2-1) will go against Rays opener Ryne Stanek (0-1) on Saturday night.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

BOSTON --  The Red Sox have been among baseball's hottest-hitting teams in May. It's gotten the defending World Series champions above .500 for the first time this season.	Mitch Moreland hit a three-run home run, Rafael Devers and Andrew Benintendi each added a solo homer, and Boston rolled to a 14-1 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Friday night.	The Red Sox (20-19) have won nine of 11, scoring 80 runs during the stretch and outscoring opponents 66-25 this month. Seven of their runs Friday came with two outs.	"I know it's hard to do, but good teams do that. We really believe we have a good team," manager Alex Cora said. "I feel like we're getting closer to who we are."	Seattle (20-21) lost for the 10th time in 12 games and is under .500 for the first time since the end of the 2017 season. The club started this year 13-2.	Eduardo Rodriguez (4-2) pitched seven scoreless innings, allowing five hits and striking out five to pick up his third win in four starts. It was the first time Rodriguez lasted seven innings in a start since Sept. 23, 2017, at Cincinnati.  The Red Sox have won each of Rodriguez's last six starts.	"I had everything working tonight," Rodriguez said. "It's the first time I went seven innings in like two years, so it's something I'm having in my mind every time I go out there and see my pitch count. But today was pretty good."	Rookie Erik Swanson (1-4) took the loss, allowing seven hits and seven runs over 4 2/3 innings.	"It is a learning process for him," said bench coach Manny Acta, filling in for manager Scott Servais, who was attending his daughter's graduation. "We like him a lot. He had good stuff at the beginning, but they caught up to him."	It marked the latest rough outing for a Mariners' pitching staff that has given up 11 or more runs four times in 12 games.	The Red Sox did the brunt of their damage in the third inning.	Jackie Bradley Jr. led off with a double down the left field line and scored on Mookie Betts' two-out single up the middle.	J.D. Martinez moved Betts over to third base with a single, and Moreland cleared the bases with his looping blast that landed just over Boston's bullpen in center. It was Moreland's 11th home run of the season.	Devers led off the fourth inning with a line-drive homer over the Mariners' bullpen in right field.	Moreland added an RBI double in the fifth.	Boston scored in all but two innings.	Cora said getting back to .500 was just the first goal the team had after starting the season 2-8.	"We did it without playing our best baseball," he said. "I think we still can do better."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: Placed IF Dylan Moore on the 10-day injured list with a right wrist bruise. Moore was injured after being hit by a pitch Wednesday against the Yankees. ... Scans on the right wrist of 2B Dee Gordon revealed no fractures. He is day-to-day. He was forced to leave Seattle's game against the Yankees on Thursday after getting hit by a pitch from J.A. Happ.	Red Sox: Cora said left-hander David Price (left elbow tendinitis) continues to throw, "feels a lot better" and "seems like he's in a good place." The plan is for him to get in a few bullpen sessions before a decision is made on his next step. ... Cora said he texted with 2B Dustin Pedroia (left knee irritation), who is travelling with Double-A Portland. Cora said next for Pedroia is to see how he reacts to playing three straight games. ... Utility man Brock Holt (scratched cornea) was with the team Friday and could soon begin a rehab assignment.	`BACK TO BASEBALL'	Cora said there was no uneasiness in the clubhouse a day after several members of the team decided not to attend a celebration at the White House for Boston's World Series championship.	"That's the route we decided, and we respect everything and we're fine with it. Back to baseball today," Cora said. "In my world, I decided not to go for my reasons. I know the government has helped. We still have a long way to go. That's our reality."	UP NEXT	Mariners: Felix Hernandez (1-3, 5.20 ERA) gets the ball for Saturday's matchup with Boston. He is coming off a start against the Yankees on May 6 in which he allowed three home runs in seven batters.	Red Sox. Rick Porcello (2-3, 5.11 ERA) is 2-0 with a 2.45 ERA in his last four starts. He has held opponents to a .202 batting average with 25 strikeouts during that stretch.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.

HOUSTON --  Justin Verlander continued his strong start to the season with arguably his best start of the year.	Verlander pitched one-hit ball for seven dominant innings, right fielder Josh Reddick made another leaping catch and the Houston Astros beat the Texas Rangers 3-0 on Friday night.	The only hit off Verlander (6-1) was a single by Asdrubal Cabrera to lead off the fifth.	"In a tight ballgame like that, you're kind of on edge the whole time," Verlander said. "One mistake could obviously lose you the ballgame. From the first inning through the seventh, it was a grind. The boys behind me did a great job."	Jake Marisnick homered in the third, and Yuli Gurriel and Robinson Chirinos hit back-to-back solo home runs with two outs in the seventh.	Astros star second baseman Jose Altuve exited in the first inning with left hamstring discomfort after beating out an infield single. He was listed as day to day.	Houston manager AJ Hinch said Altuve looked uncomfortable at first, and he was working to stretch his hamstring.	"He just said that he felt something in his left hamstring," Hinch said. "He's been evaluated. It doesn't seem serious. We don't know the extent of the injury until we get to tomorrow. He was frustrated, but he made the right decision to alert us of some soreness."	Verlander struck out eight, walked two and hit a batter.	"Big night for him," Hinch said. "He had command of his pitches. He had some stuff left in the tank, too. I think he could have gone out there for the eighth, so really encouraged that he was so in control yet so dominant."	Texas manager Chris Woodward said Verlander did a good job of mixing up his pitches.	"So many weapons," Woodward said. "He has command of all his pitches, he throws his slider off his fastball and can throw his curve at any time. He doesn't give you much to hit."	Ryan Pressly threw a perfect eighth. Roberto Osuna pitched around a single in the ninth for his 10th save, helped by Reddick.	A day after reaching over the wall to take away a go-ahead, three-run homer from Texas' Hunter Pence, Reddick leaped for a catch against the wall to rob Elvis Andrus of extra bases.	Carlos Correa helped Verlander in the third, making a diving snag of Ronald Guzman's hard grounder deep in the hole at short, popping up and getting the out at first.	"You don't know how that changes the game," Verlander said. "You don't know what happens after that. I know it's a big momentum shifter. A guy makes a play like that, and for me, against the other team, it's kind of deflating. It's just a huge momentum boost."	Lance Lynn (4-3) allowed three runs in seven innings, striking out eight. The three home runs Lynn gave up were as many as he had allowed in his previous seven starts combined this season.	"Everything but three pitches, and all three of those left the ballpark," Lynn said. "I gave up too many runs. You have to match Verlander, especially you saw early he was going good, so you knew you had to make pitches and try to keep them off the board."	MOVING UP	Verlander passed Frank Tanana for 22nd on the all-time strikeouts list by fanning Rougned Odor in the seventh. He now has 2,774 strikeouts in his career.	HE SAID IT	"You look at tonight and you get beat by a Cy Young Award winner. That's part of the game, especially when he's one." -- Lynn on the loss to Verlander.	ASTROS POWER	Houston has hit 22 home runs in the last eight games. The Astros got home runs in the same game from the No. 7, 8 and 9 hitters in their lineup for the second time in franchise history. The other time was June 12, 2015, against the Mariners when Luis Valbuena, Chris Carter and Jason Castro connected.	UP NEXT	Astros RHP Gerrit Cole (3-4, 4.17 ERA) will make his ninth start of the season, seeking his third straight win after allowing four runs in 6 1/3 innings in his last outing Monday against the Royals. The Rangers will start RHP Jesse Chavez (0-1, 7.27) on Saturday as an opener.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

MINNEAPOLIS --  The starting pitching for Minnesota has been stellar, thanks to some strategic adjustments and natural improvement by several members of the rotation.	All those home runs by the Twins have sure helped, too.	Jake Odorizzi stretched his scoreless streak to 20 innings with seven frames of one-hit ball, Max Kepler and Mitch Garver homered, and the thriving Twins beat the Detroit Tigers 6-0 on Friday night.	"With this offense, we're never out of a game. It's a fun team to be a part of right now, and as the summer goes on, it'll be even more enjoyable," Odorizzi said.	Odorizzi (5-2) retired his last 20 batters after a first-inning double by Christin Stewart, striking out five without a walk while lowering his ERA to a career-best 2.32. The right-hander beat the Yankees in New York with six shutout innings last weekend and defeated the Houston Astros with seven scoreless innings in his turn before that. He's relied on his slider and cut fastball more than ever with remarkable results.	"As a pitcher, when you know what a pitch is going to do, it gives you a lot more confidence to throw it," said Odorizzi, who has won each of his last five starts.	Jose Berrios, Martin Perez and more recently Kyle Gibson have been just as good.	"Every time I catch them, it seems like it's the best outing I've seen," Garver said. "I don't know how far they can carry that, but I'm just impressed."	Jorge Polanco drove in three, including a two-run double in the third for the Twins (24-12), who have the best record in the majors. They are 12 games over .500 for the first time since the end of the 2010 season.	Garver, part of a trio of catchers who have collectively been the most productive offensively in baseball this season, hit a two-run homer in the fourth inning off Tyson Ross (1-5) for his eighth shot in 21 games. Garver also drew three walks. Kepler went deep in the fifth for the Twins, who entered the evening ranked fourth in the majors in homers and are on pace to smash their team record (225 in 1963).	"I came into this season looking to be that force in the lineup," Garver said.	The Tigers were blanked for the second straight game and an American League-most fifth time this season.	Detroit's rotation has been decent, but Ross has bogged it down. The right-hander gave up six runs in five innings with four walks and one hit batter with only two strikeouts, pushing his ERA up to 6.11.	"He's been there and done it," Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire said. "He's just misfiring."	COLLISION COURSE	As Marwin Gonzalez beat out an infield single in the sixth, Ross threw wildly past first baseman Niko Goodrum, who bruised Gonzalez's face with his leg as he descended from his jump to try to catch the ball. Both players left the game. Gonzalez showed no signs of a concussion. Goodrum bruised his right knee.	"He's very sore. They had it checked out, X-rays, the whole package, and everything came back negative," Gardenhire said.	STARTING TO FILL UP	The announced attendance was 26,789, the second-largest of the season at Target Field with a first-pitch temperature of 60 degrees and ample sunshine. The Twins held a flash sale this week for their 12 remaining games in May, with $5 seats available in the upper deck outfield sections without processing fees. They sold 20,000 in about 20 hours. Then another 12,000 standing room tickets were snatched up in less than a day.	With a season ticket base eroded by fan apathy from an average of 91 losses over the previous eight seasons, the Twins played in front of the eight smallest crowds in Target Field history -- all under 15,000 -- over their first 15 home games. Cold, damp April weather didn't help. The Twins entered the weekend ranked 23rd out of 30 major league teams in average attendance (16,843 tickets sold per game).	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: Stewart, making his first start since April 17 after suffering a strained right quadriceps, batted second for his highest position in the lineup this season.	Twins: 3B Miguel Sano has been moved up to Triple-A Rochester on his extended rehab assignment for a severe cut on his right heel that has kept him out all season. Baldelli wouldn't put a timetable on his return, but he made next week sound realistic.	UP NEXT	The Tigers will start RHP Spencer Turnbull (2-2, 2.31 ERA) in the split doubleheader Saturday that was scheduled to make up the April 12 matchup postponed by wintry weather. LHP Gregory Soto is slated to make his major league debut while taking the mound in the second game.	RHP Michael Pineda (2-3, 6.09 ERA) will pitch the first game for the Twins. RHP Kohl Stewart (0-1, 7.50 ERA) will be promoted from Triple-A Rochester to start the nightcap.	---	More AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Ned Yost saw that Alex Gordon was dragging a little bit early in the week. So the Kansas City manager gave the outfielder a day off Wednesday. With the team not playing Thursday, Gordon had two full days to rest.	The move paid off in a big way as he homered twice to drive in three runs, and the Kansas City Royals beat the Philadelphia Phillies 5-1 Friday night.	"I definitely felt it. I felt fresh and felt good," Gordon said.	Gordon hit a two-run home run over the bullpen in right field in the bottom of the first inning and added a solo shot in the bottom of the fifth.	Gordon's second home run was the 1,500th hit of his career and gave him the fifth multihomer game of his career and first since August 20, 2016.	"It's cool. I'm lucky to play this game as long as I have and very humbled by 1,500 hits and I'm just happy that I'm still able to do it," Gordon said.	Homer Bailey (4-3) gave up one run and four hits in five-plus innings, and Scott Barlow struck out a career-high six in two innings of relief for the Royals. Jorge Soler added his team-leading 10th home run of the season.	"I thought Homer was good," Yost said. "I didn't think he was great, but he was good. I thought he continued to make pitches all night long. He just executed pitches all night long."	Bailey left after giving up back-to-back singles to lead off the sixth. Barlow came in and pitched around a one-out walk to strike out the side and leave the bases loaded, then struck out all three batters he faced in the seventh inning.	"I thought it was an opportunity for us to do some damage. That's for sure," Phillies manager Gabe Kapler said. "Obviously you want to drive the ball in that situation, but it's round ball, round bat, and sometimes you do everything in your power and the other guy just beats you. I think that's what happened in that situation. Barlow pitched a good inning there."	After giving up 10 runs in 10 innings over his first two starts, Bailey has allowed just 12 runs in his last six outings with a 3.48 ERA over 31 innings.	Jake Diekman worked his eighth consecutive scoreless outing, striking out two batters in the eighth inning and Ian Kennedy pitched a perfect ninth. The Royals' bullpen threw four hitless innings and struck out eight.	"I don't think you could say enough good words about the job the bullpen did tonight," Bailey said.	Phillies starter Jake Arrieta (4-3) also went five-plus innings, giving up four runs and seven hits. He allowed three home runs in a start for the first time since May 29, 2015, against the Royals. Gordon also went deep in that game.	"Just too many mistakes up in the zone," Arrieta said. "The sinker has to be down; it has to be more down, to force him to put the ball on the ground. The one that he hit out in the fourth or fifth inning was too much elevated in a 2-0 count. And the first pitch of the at-bat to Soler was just up. Those need to be down. Three mistakes got hit over the fence. Just need to be better."	Bryce Harper walked three times and scored Philadelphia's only run of the game, coming home on Odubel Herrera's RBI grounder in the fourth.	BATTLE OF THE BEST	J.T. Realmuto has thrown out 11 baserunners and has a 50% caught stealing rate, both tops in the MLB. Kansas City leads the majors with 37 stolen bases this season with a 72.5% success rate. On Friday, Realmuto caught two of four runners stealing, keeping his 50% mark on the season. Adalberto Mondesi swiped two bags, his 11th and 12th of the season, and is now tied with the Chicago White Sox's Tim Anderson for the major league lead.	UNFAMILIAR FOES	Philadelphia had its first regular-season game in Kansas City since June 10, 2007, and just the 13th meeting overall between the two teams. For Philadelphia, it's tied for the fewest games played against any single opponent. It's the second-fewest games played against an opponent for Kansas City, with Friday's game breaking a tie with the Los Angeles Dodgers.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: Kapler said infielder Scott Kingery (right hamstring strain) could begin a minor-league rehab assignment on Monday. ... RHP David Robertson (right elbow soreness) and RHP Tommy Hunter (right forearm strain) played catch for first time Friday, but neither is close to a return to game action.	UP NEXT	Royals: RHP Brad Keller (2-3, 3.99 ERA) will make his first career start against the Phillies on Saturday. Keller pitched 5 1/3 innings Sunday, allowing two runs on six hits and taking a no-decision in a 5-2 loss to Detroit.	Phillies: RHP Zach Eflin (4-3, 3.00 ERA) will face the Royals for the first time.	---	More AP baseball coverage: www.apnews.com/MLB and www.twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ST. LOUIS --  Trevor Williams didn't have his prettiest outing, but he'll take it.	Adam Frazier opened the game with a homer, Starling Marte drove in the game-winner and Williams allowed one run in seven solid innings as the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the St. Louis Cardinals 2-1 on Friday night.	Marte's RBI single off of Andrew Miller (1-2) broke a 1-1 tie in the eighth and helped the Pirates snap a two-game skid.	Williams (2-1) stranded seven runners through the first four innings, and pitched around two fielding errors in the fourth inning. He allowed nine hits and limited the Cardinals to one hit in seven at-bats with runners in scoring position.	"You really try to bear down with runners in scoring position, especially in a one-run ballgame," Williams said. "It's just pitch execution and trusting your gut and trusting your instincts and trusting your catcher and executing the pitch."	The Cardinals finished with one hit in nine at-bats with runners in scoring position, one night after getting a whopping 11 hits in that situation. St. Louis lost for the seventh time in nine games.	"He threw the ball very well, one of the best performances we've seen against us this year and he deserves credit for that," Cardinals manager Mike Shildt said. "He did a nice job. Made a lot, a lot of quality pitches all night and was able to make pitches and we weren't able to execute when we had runners on base. That's what it came down to."	The only run allowed by Williams was shift-aided. Paul DeJong grounded a slow roller to second, but Frazier was playing on the third base side of the bag and couldn't get to the ball in time to make a throw. The infield hit scored Yairo Munoz, tying the game 1-1 in the seventh inning.	"Williams sets this whole thing up," Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said. "Seven strong, six mishit balls in the seventh inning to score a run off of him. All the outs (in the seventh) were mishit. The base hits were mishit and its 11 guys retired on three pitches or less only and one 3-ball count. This is a craftsman at work out there."	Williams pounded the strike zone, getting ahead of 25 of the 31 batters he faced.	"Hats off to Trevor," Cardinals second baseman Kolten Wong said. "He pitched a really good game. Kept us off balance the entire night. We put together some hits, man. We just couldn't drive them in."	Kyle Crick pitched out of a jam in the eighth inning with runners on first and third. Felipe Vazquez struck out Paul Goldschmidt to cap a perfect ninth and earn his 11th save.	Frazier drove a 3-2 fastball from Adam Wainwright over the right field wall to give the Pirates a 1-0 lead. It was the second time this year -- and fourth time in his career -- that Frazier began a game with a home run.	The Pirates' Josh Bell extended his hitting streak to 10 games in the first inning and saved a run with a diving stop on a smash by Matt Carpenter that ended the second inning.	"He's come around a lot this year defensively," Williams said. "It's gone from holding your breath to he's making the play. It's been fun to watch all the work that he's put in off the field that you guys don't see . he really takes pride in his first base and its showing this year."	Wainwright went a season-high seven innings and retired the final 10 batters he faced. He struck out eight -- five looking -- and allowed five hits and no walks.	BATTERY MATES	It was the 250th time that Yadier Molina caught a Wainwright start, moving the duo to ninth all-time in the majors ahead of Early Wynn and Jim Hegan (1949-1957 Cleveland Indians).	YADI HONORED	Molina was presented with the 2018 Roberto Clemente Award before the game for to his humanitarian efforts in his native Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria. Luis Clemente, the second-oldest son of Roberto, and Hall of Famer Ozzie Smith presented the award.	TRAINING ROOM	Pirates: RHP Chris Archer (right thumb irritation) threw a four-inning, 60-pitch simulated game to teammates Corey Dickerson, Lonnie Chisenhall and Elias Diaz on Friday. He said he had no issues griping the ball on any of his pitches.	"I threw everything, everything felt fine, no pitch was affected, body feels good," Archer said. "I'm not sure exactly where we go from here, but I'm ready to pitch five days from now in a big league game."	Cardinals: RHP Carlos Martinez (right shoulder cuff strain) threw a scoreless inning of relief, striking out two and giving up a hit, at Triple-A Memphis on Friday night. He is still considered two weeks away.	UP NEXT	The Pirates will send RHP Jordan Lyles (2-1, 2.20 ERA) to the mound against the Cardinals and RHP Miles Mikolas (4-2, 4.02 ERA) in the third of a four-game series on Saturday. Lyles gave up one run in a season-high 6 2/3 innings in a no-decision against Oakland on Sunday. Mikolas pitched seven scoreless innings and didn't walk a batter for the first time this season against Philadelphia on Monday.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

DENVER --  German Marquez got outs when he needed to and helped himself at the plate, too.	Marquez pitched effectively into the sixth inning and had a three-run double in Colorado's seven-run fourth inning as the Rockies beat the San Diego Padres 12-2 on Friday night.	He went 5 2/3 innings and allowed two runs and 10 hits -- all singles. He became the fifth pitcher in the team's history to give up 10 or more hits without an extra-base hit when he did it April 19 against Philadelphia and is now the first Rockies pitcher in team history to do it twice.	"I thought he threw the ball well," Colorado manager Bud Black said. "He kept the ball down. He had good command of his fastball and he made critical pitches when he needed to."	Marquez walked none and had seven strikeouts	"Overall the fastball was down today and I felt really good with it," Marquez said through an interpreter. "They did happen to have some good at bats and they got some hits. I think overall you just have to continue to make pitches. You get the job done no matter what."	Trevor Story also homered among his three hits for the Rockies, winners of three of their last four. Nolan Arenado added a two-run triple and Ian Desmond had three hits.	Manny Machado and Ty France each had RBI singles for the Padres and Franmil Reyes had three hits.	Black attributed the frequency of base hits by the Padres to "the old seeing-eye single."	"A couple of ground balls went through," Black added, noting that Marquez kept San Diego in the yard, a team that coming into the game had scored 54.4 percent of its runs off homers. That's the third highest percentage in baseball.	Eric Lauer (2-4) went three-plus innings in his shortest outing of the season and allowed a career-high eight runs and eight hits. It was his first outing at Coors Field since making his major league debut here April 24, 2018, when he also went three innings and allowed seven runs, including a slam to Story.	"Just didn't have great command," Lauer said. "I kind of lost it there in that (big) inning. When you lose command against a team like that, they're going to make you pay."	Story staked Marquez to an early lead when he drove the first pitch he saw from Lauer in Colorado's third inning into the left-field seats. Charlie Blackmon singled ahead of Story's ninth homer of the season.	The Rockies sent 11 batters to the plate in the bottom of the fourth and had their season high for scoring. Tony Wolters' infield single with the bases loaded drove in the first run of the inning. Marquez, awarded a Silver Slugger last season when he led all major league pitchers with a .300 average, doubled to the center-field wall to clear the bases.	"There were two (pitches) that I just barely missed down," Lauer said. "I think obviously he knew I was throwing a fastball and he was ready for it. It wasn't a horrible pitch, but a good hitting pitcher's going to hit it."	Daniel Murphy added a two-run double and Desmond drove in the last run with his second single of the inning.	Marquez allowed three straight singles to start the Padres' fifth, including Machado's run-scoring single. But he came back to strike out the side around France's RBI single.	"Marquez was aggressive," Story said. "He was challenging their guys. He was doing his thing and we got out to an early lead and gave him a little breathing room. It's nice to have one like that."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: INF Fernado Tatis Jr. took ground balls and ran at 75 percent during a workout Friday in extended spring training. Tatis has been on the 10-day injured list since April 30 with a left hamstring strain. There's no timetable yet for his return.	Rockies: LHP Chris Rusin (mid-back strain) made his second rehab appearance Thursday night for Triple-A Albuquerque. He also was expected to pitch an inning there on Saturday. ... LHP Jake McGee (left knee sprain) made first rehab appearance Thursday night for Albuquerque. He's also expected to pitch another inning there Saturday.	UP NEXT	Padres: LHP Joey Lucchesi (3-2, 5.00 ERA) has gone 4-10 with a 4.96 ERA in 20 career starts against NL West teams.	Rockies: RHP Jon Gray (3-3, 4.22 ERA) had his start pushed back after Wednesday night's game against San Francisco was postponed. He's 1-1 with a 3.75 ERA in two previous starts at Coors Field this season.	---	More AP baseball coverage: www.apnews.com/MLB and www.twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  Matt Chapman got the backdoor slider he was expecting from All-Star closer Brad Hand on a 2-2 pitch that missed the strike zone.	When Hand threw it again with a full count, Chapman jumped on it, lining a homer in the 12th inning to lift the Athletics over the Cleveland Indians 4-3 Friday night. It's Oakland's second extra-inning win this week.	"You know he's got that kind of power but this is their closer on the mound and (Hand) is never predictable in what he throws," A's manager Bob Melvin said. "At 3-2 you're just trying to battle. He just saw it early enough and put a good swing it."	Chapman drove the ball down the left field line for his first career game-ending hit. The homer was his 10th this season and the first allowed by Hand, who entered with a 1.08 ERA.	The A's doused Chapman with water as he touched home plate.	"I got down 2-2 and I knew that slider backfoot's his go-to pitch," Chapman said. "I was just trying to battle and trying to hit something hard. When I do that, I give myself the better chance to drive balls. First walkoff homer ever. I didn't even know what to do around the bases. I was pumped up."	Hand was happy with the pitch, just not the result.	"Just a tough one to lose," Hand said. "I threw a quality strike in the zone and he put a good swing on it."	Ramon Laureano also homered and Robbie Grossman had three hits for Oakland. Joakim Soria (1-2) retired six batters to win.	The A's have won two extra-inning games this week after losing their first three of the season.	"It feels good to get some of those clutch hits," Chapman said. "We've been grinding a little bit and to be able to come out on top of those games is huge. Last year when we we're going well we were finding ways to win those close ballgames."	Neither team managed much offense after Francisco Lindor's tying sacrifice fly in the seventh. Ryan Buchter, Blake Treinen and Soria combined to retire the final 15 Cleveland batters.	Both teams scored earlier on close plays at the plate.	Oakland's Marcus Semien doubled off the wall in left-center leading off the first. He moved to third on a fielder's choice and scored on a wild pitch, sliding into home plate before catcher Kevin Plawecki could get back.	Plawecki doubled and scored on Lindor's flyout in the seventh. Plawecki slid headfirst into home plate, just ahead of a strong throw by Grossman.	A's starter Frankie Montas matched his career-high with seven strikeouts over six innings. Montas allowed two runs, eight hits and one walk.	Jose Ramirez had an infield single and a walk for Cleveland. The Indians third baseman has reached base in 19 consecutive games, the longest active streak in the AL and second in the majors to Kris Bryant of the Cubs who has a 20-game streak.	BEATING THE MUSTACHE	Treinen retired all six batters he faced, extending his scoreless streak at the Coliseum to 32 innings. It's the longest streak by an Oakland reliever, breaking the previous mark of 31 set by Hall of Famer Rollie Fingers in 1976.	STEP BY STEP	Indians starter Cody Anderson allowed two runs and had three strikeouts in three innings in his second start since Tommy John surgery in 2017. Anderson began the season in the minors and made three relief appearances after being called up. He retired two batters and allowed four runs against Seattle in his first start May 5.	Cleveland used seven relievers after Anderson's abbreviated start.	"It's tough because you have no idea you are going to go 12 innings," Indians manager Terry Francona said. "That was a lot of innings for the bullpen to cover."	TRAINERS ROOM	Indians: Mike Clevinger (upper back) threw long toss up to 150 feet and will do again Sunday before being re-evaluated.	Athletics: Khris Davis sat out a second consecutive game because of a left hip contusion.	UP NEXT	RHP Trevor Bauer (4-2, 3.42 ERA) takes the mound for Cleveland on Saturday and will try to bounce back after giving up eight runs in a loss to the White Sox in his previous start. Bauer is 0-3 at the Coliseum. RHP Aaron Brooks (2-3, 5.74) starts for Oakland, his first since April 30. The A's skipped his previous two turns in the rotation.	--	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.

PHOENIX --  Ronald Acuna Jr. made an auspicious return to the leadoff spot Friday night, driving a career-best 466-foot homer to lift the Atlanta Braves past Arizona.	Acuna's tiebreaking shot off the batter's eye in center with two outs in the eighth inning helped the Braves end a four-game skid with a 2-1 victory over the Diamondbacks.	When did he know it was gone?	"Right away," Acuna said via translator with a smile.	After hitting cleanup in each of his previous 36 starts this season, Acuna returned to the top of the order -- his regular place while winning NL Rookie of the Year last season -- and hit his eighth homer off Yoan Lopez (0-1).	"I'm going to feel good no matter where they put me in the lineup," Acuna said." I'm just happy to be in the lineup. For me, it is just about focusing and getting the work done."	Acuna has homers in two of his last three games after making a slight adjustment in the Dodgers' series earlier this week. He hit a 2-0 fastball from Lopez, who has been scored on in only four of his 29 appearances but three times in four outings against Atlanta.	"You can't fall behind a good hitter like Acuna," Lopez said through a translator. "The Braves have been the only team that has been able to get to me, but it is all part of the process."	"I don't want to jinx things, but he is swinging the bat better," Atlanta manager Brian Snitker said.	The Braves got a good outing from Julio Teheran to overcome Zack Greinke's latest strong start. Greinke allowed a run and five hits over seven innings, posting his eighth straight quality start. He didn't walk a batter and reached a three-ball count against only two hitters -- the last two he faced while escaping a two-on jam in the seventh.	Teheran pitched six innings of one-run ball, Dan Winkler (1-0) pitched the seventh and Luke Jackson struck out two in ninth for his third save after blowing one in the first game of the series Thursday.	Teheran gave up three hits, struck out four and walked two. He has given up one run in his last two starts without getting a decision.	"I just wish we could get some runs," Snitker said.	Dansby Swanson had three hits, and Freddie Freeman had two hits for Atlanta.	David Peralta had two hits, including an RBI triple, for Arizona.	Swanson tripled to right-center with one out in the fourth inning and scored on Freeman's single over the shift for a 1-0 lead.	Ketel Marte doubled off the left field fence with two outs in the sixth and scored on Peralta's triple over the first base bag to tie it at 1, ending Teheran's steak of scoreless innings at 12.	"It's unfortunate when you get a night like we did out of Zack and you can't really capitalize offensively," Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Braves: LHP Max Fried (left hand contusion) is expected to start Sunday after reporting no discomfort after a bullpen session Thursday. Fried was struck by a line drive and removed in the second inning of his last start at the Los Angeles Dodgers on Tuesday.	Diamondbacks: RHP Taijuan Walker (elbow ligament) threw 23 pitches in a bullpen session Friday and is likely to throw another bullpen session Sunday before pitching in a rehab game. ... C Alex Avila (quadriceps strain) did all the normal pregame work and blocked balls in the dirt Friday and is close to returning. Avila, out since April 7, may not need a rehab assignment, Lovullo said. ... 1B/3B Jake Lamb (quadriceps strain) did some light running and took ground balls Friday while continuing to hit. Lamb will play first and third when he returns, Lovullo said, but is not expected back on the homestead that ends May 19. ... INF Ildemaro Vargas was optioned to Triple-A after the game. A corresponding move is expected Saturday.	UP NEXT	Braves: RHP Kevin Gausman (1-3), who was ejected and given a five-game suspension for throwing a pitch behind Miami's Jose Urena on May 3, will make his second start while his suspension is under appeal. Gausman has given up 14 earned runs in his last 16 1/3 innings.	Diamondbacks: RHP Merrill Kelly (3-3) gave up a season-high seven runs in four innings in his last start Monday at Tampa Bay. He had given up as many as four runs only once previously.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

LOS ANGELES --  Everything is going all right for Dodgers outfielder Joc Pederson this year.	Pederson homered twice, Kenta Maeda pitched one-hit ball over six innings and Los Angeles cruised past the Washington Nationals 5-0 Friday night.	Pederson hit his 14th career leadoff homer in the first inning, tying Rafael Furcal for second on the team's career list. He struck again in the fifth, putting a ball in the back of Washington's bullpen for his 12th of the season. Pederson has 11 career multihomer games and three this season.	All 12 of his home runs have come against right-handed pitching, tying the Brewers' Christian Yelich for most against righties this season. And he is doing his damage with sporadic playing time as the Dodgers rotate their outfielders, other than Cody Bellinger, who plays daily.	"Rhythm and flow plays a huge role into being consistent," said Pederson, a left-handed hitter who has just 17 at-bats and three hits against lefties this year. "It's really good when you can get in there and get into game flow to ride out pitches."	Maeda gave up just Wilmer Difo's single to lead off the third as the Dodgers won for the 11th time in their last 12 home games. Maeda (4-2) struck out six and walked two.	"I had a good feeling on my pitches around the fifth and six innings in my outing (Sunday) at San Diego," Maeda said through a translator. "The biggest difference was my slider. I had a good feeling on the break, and I was able to carry that over today."	Julio Urias pitched three innings of scoreless relief for his second career save. It was Urias' second save in two outings after he pitched a scoreless inning Monday, but the Dodgers prefer the swing man to get multiple innings whenever possible.	"He is strong in every facet of the word, physically, and more importantly mentally with the different roles that are presented to him," manager Dave Roberts said.	Anibal Sanchez (0-6) allowed three runs and six hits in 4 1/3 innings, including both of Pederson's homers. He has not won a start since Sept. 23 and has not won a game on the road since Aug. 3.	"It's many years at this level, I played through everything," Sanchez said. "I need to continue to work. At some point, everything is going to change for good. As long as I continue healthy, I think I can do something good on the mound."	The Dodgers also got an RBI triple from Chris Taylor in the fourth on a ball misplayed by right fielder Adam Eaton.	David Freese added a two-run homer in the seventh off reliever Matt Grace to give the Dodgers 39 home runs at home this season.	Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy preserved the shutout with two outs in the eighth with a diving stop on Anthony Rendon's hard, bases-loaded grounder down the line. Muncy got to his feet and dived to third base for a force out.	SEAGER SCRATCHED	The Dodgers won without shortstop Corey Seager, who was scratched shortly before first pitch and was not on the bench at the start of the game due to a personal matter. Seager was back in the dugout and available to pinch hit in the later innings.	"Corey just had something personal that came up literally an hour before the game so he had to go take care of it," Roberts said. "Family first. Personal stuff first. He went and took care of it and was back on the bench sometime in the middle of the game."	The Dodgers also played without third baseman Justin Turner, who was given a day off against a right-handed pitcher.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: LF Juan Soto, on the 10-day injured list with back spasms, took batting practice and ran the bases. He is expected to be activated before Saturday's game.	Dodgers: LHP Caleb Ferguson started a rehab assignment at Class A Rancho Cucamonga following an oblique strain. Ferguson struck out two and walked one in a scoreless inning.	UP NEXT	Nationals: The Nationals are 1-7 this season in games started by RHP Max Scherzer (1-4, 3.78 ERA), including five straight losses. That's the longest such skid for Scherzer's teams in his starts since a six-game slide for Arizona and Detroit spanning the 2009 and `10 seasons.	Dodgers: RHP Walker Buehler (4-0, 4.95) hit 99 mph for the first time this season in his start Monday against the Braves and also reached 100 pitches for the first time.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

SAN FRANCISCO --  When Luis Castillo walked the first two batters he faced, he didn't panic. Instead he just kept his focus.	Castillo struck out a season-high 11 in six innings, Nick Senzel hit a two-run triple and the Cincinnati Reds beat the San Francisco Giants 7-0 on Friday night.	"I think in the first inning I didn't feel comfortable there, I think my consistency wasn't there," Castillo said through a translator. "I said `OK, I have to be the pitcher that I am."	Yasiel Puig added a two-run single and Senzel got two hits.	Castillo (4-1) allowed two hits and walked five. Last Sunday, facing the Giants in Cincinnati, the hard-throwing 26-year-old took a no-hitter into the sixth inning and was sitting on four-run lead, then gave up four runs in a game San Francisco won 6-5.	Castillo's ability to find his command the way he did was no ordinary occurrence for a young pitcher, Reds manager David Bell said.	"They may find it, but to then pitch as well as he did, it is pretty rare," Bell said. "Usually something's a little bit off and it's hard to make an adjustment in the middle of the game. I think just with his movement, it took him a couple of hitters to settle in, but there's some toughness there, mental toughness to make that adjustment on the fly like that."	Castillo combined with Zach Duke, Michael Lorenzen and Wandy Peralta on a four-hitter.	The Reds led 1-0 in the second when they put two on with two outs for Senzel. He hit a deep drive off Dereck Rodriguez (3-5) and center fielder Steven Duggar crashed into the wall trying to make what would have been a great catch, but the ball popped out of his glove on impact.	Senzel wound up with a triple and later scored on a double by Eugenio Suarez.	Puig's single came in a three-run ninth.	Rodriguez lost his third straight start. Stephen Vogt had three hits and walk in his sixth game with the Giants and is batting .467 (7 for 15) with his new team.	The Giants' best threat came in the fifth, when Vogt doubled after Panik drew a two-out walk, but Castillo got Evan Longoria to hit a weak grounder to him off a slider on his first offering.	"He's got great stuff and throws hard," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said of Castillo. "He's got a plus fastball and a plus change. We put pressure on him, got men on base but we couldn't get the hit to keep it going."	TEAM TEAL	The Stanley Cup made an appearance at Oracle Park, part of a Bay Area promotional tour in support of the San Jose Sharks, who advanced to the Western Conference finals. NHL "keeper of the Cup" Phil Pritchard flew the trophy to San Francisco from the NHL Hall of Fame in Toronto on Thursday night. The Cup was displayed in the Giants' dugout during pregame and on the concourse adjacent to the San Francisco Bay. The Giants also used the Cup as a ball holder when they pitched batting practice.	SPLASH HITS	With the Giants trailing 4-0 in the fourth inning, fans erupted in cheers when Warriors "Splash Brothers" Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson hit key 3-pointers down the stretch in Golden State's 118-113 series-clinching Game 6 victory over the Houston Rockets in the Western Conference semifinals.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: OF Jesse Winker was back in the lineup after missing two games with tightness in his left quadriceps.	Giants: CF Kevin Pillar was out of the lineup after starting 31 straight games. ... C Buster Posey, who went on the concussion list on Thursday (retroactive to Wednesday), was scheduled to be evaluated by a doctor Friday night, Bochy said. ... 1B Brandon Belt left the game in the top of the ninth, an inning after walking off the field awkwardly after trying to beat out an infield grounder. Bochy said he'll undergo an MRI and probably miss the next game or two. ... Pitching coach Curt Young missed Friday's game to attend his daughter's graduation from University of Arizona.

BOSTON --  Sandy Leon was frustrated he didn't drive one run in with a safety squeeze. Instead, he drove in three with a drive over the Green Monster.	Leon fouled off his bunt attempt, then hit a three-run homer to cap an eight-run third inning that carried the surging Boston Red Sox over the struggling Seattle Mariners 9-5 on Saturday.	"If he gets it down, we score a run and have a runner at second," Red Sox manager Alex Cora said. "It's always good to see him contribute offensively. We know what he can do defensively, what he does behind the plate. Whenever he contributes offensively it's a plus."	Mitch Moreland started Boston's comeback from a 4-0 deficit against Felix Hernandez (1-4) with a solo homer. The World Series champions won for the 15th time in 21 games following a 6-13 start.	Seattle has lost 14 of 18 and dropped to 20-22, falling below .500 on Friday for the first time since the end of the 2017 season. The Mariners have been outscored 23-6 in the first two games of the three-game series.	Jay Bruce hit a two-run homer and reached 900 RBI.	Hernandez allowed seven runs and six hits in 2 1/3 innings. The 2010 AL Cy Young Award winner is 0-4 in seven starts since beating the Los Angeles Angels in his season debut. He became the 36th pitcher to reach 2,500 strikeouts when rookie Michael Chavis took a 92 mph sinker for a called third strike in the second inning.	"I did. Finally," Hernandez said smiling. "Hopefully I can play a few more years to get to 3,000."	Rick Porcello (3-3), the 2016 AL Cy Young winner, gave up four runs and five hits -- all in the first -- in 6 2/3 innings. He is unbeaten in five starts after losing in his first three appearances.	"I made better pitches," Porcello said of his in-game turnaround. "I was leaving a lot of pitches in the middle of the plate."	Moreland homered in the second, the ninth home run off Hernandez this season.	Xander Bogaerts' RBI single and Rafael Devers' two-run singled chased Hernandez, in his second shortest start this season. Jackie Bradley Jr.'s two-run single off Roenis Elias put Boston ahead 6-4. With Bradley on first and Chavis creeping down the line from third, Leon fouled off his safety attempt. Three pitches later, Leon lined a fastball into the first row of Monster seats for his first homer since last Aug. 14.	Seattle scored four times in a four-pitch span with two outs in the first. Dan Vogelbach and Domingo Santana hit RBI doubles and Bruce followed with his 12th homer, a drive into Boston's bullpen.	BIG THREE	Boston had a nine-run third inning last Saturday in a 15-2 rout of the White Sox that included 10 straight hits, one shy of the major league record set by Colorado Rockies against the Chicago Cubs on July 30, 2010	FILLING IN	Seattle bench coach Manny Acta was the acting manager for the second straight game. Manager Scott Servais was attending his daughter Victoria's graduation from Mississippi. Servais is expected back Sunday.	DEBUT	Mariners 2B Shed Long made his major league debut, bouncing to second on the first pitch he saw and going 0 for 3 with a walk. Asked what advice he gave him, Acta said: "Don't let all aura of Fenway Park take away from the moment -- embrace it. It's a special opportunity, know that you're going to be here for a long time. Take a deep breath."	"It's a historical park," Long said. "So many greats have played here. So many Hall of Famers that's played here. So many Hall of Famers on the field, so I mean it's definitely a special place to make your debut at."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: Acta said INF Dee Gordon was still day-to-day after getting hit on the right wrist by Yankees LHP J.A. Happ on Thursday. "He's available to pinch run," Acta said. "He's got to figure out how to slide and not put his hand down."	Red Sox: Cora said LHP David Price will throw a bullpen on Sunday. Price has not pitched since May 3 due to left elbow tendinitis.	UP NEXT	LHP Marco Gonzales (5-1, 3.08 ERA) was slated to start the series finale for the Mariners and RHP Hector Velazquez (0-2, 4.03) for the Red Sox.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Maybe it was the shoes for Ronny Rodriguez.	The Detroit Tigers shortstop had an option of wearing gray or orange shoes for the first game of a doubleheader against Minnesota. He chose the former, and now his teammates might have to follow suit.	Rodriguez hit a pair of solo homers, and John Hicks hit a tiebreaking homer in the ninth inning as the Tigers beat the Twins 5-3 in Saturday's opener.	"Before the game, I asked him, `Where's the orange shoes?" Tigers bench coach Steve Liddle said. "He goes, `Oh, papi, the gray ones are hot,' and he wasn't lying. So, I think everyone's going to be wearing gray shoes for the night game."	Brandon Dixon also homered for the Tigers, who beat the AL Central-leading Twins for the first time this season and snapped Minnesota's four-game winning streak.	The Twins tied it 3-3 in the eighth when C.J. Cron homered off Joe Jimenez (2-1) before Hicks connected on the first pitch from reliever Trevor Hildenberger (2-2). Detroit added an insurance run on Christin Stewart's RBI single to right.	Rodriguez's solo shots came in the second and fourth innings, including a career-long 454-foot blast to left-center. It was the first multi-homer game of his career. His five homers are tops on the Tigers.	"I don't look for homers," Rodriguez said. "I just have a good contact, put the bat down and run the bases."	Shane Greene pitched a scoreless ninth to earn his AL-leading 14th save.	Spencer Turnbull allowed two runs in 5 2/3 innings for Detroit. He departed after Jason Castro's homer, which followed a successful challenge that backfired for Detroit. Castro took first base, appearing to be hit by a pitch from Turnbull. The Tigers challenged the call, and it was ruled the ball hit Castro's bat. He returned to the batter's box and launched his fifth homer of the season.	Michael Pineda allowed three runs in six-plus innings, departing after allowing a pair of singles to open the seventh. He gave up both of Rodriguez's homers and did not issue a walk for the second time in eight starts this season.	"I'm happy because I tried to pitch a quality game, and this was a quality game," Pineda said. "But at the end of the day, I'm not happy because we lost."	Twins manager Rocco Baldelli was encouraged by the start from Pineda, who continues to work his way back after missing last season following Tommy John surgery.	"A few little spurts again where maybe he finds it and loses and finds it and loses it, but as a whole I thought it was a very productive start," Baldelli said. "He kept us in the game and threw the ball well."	Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire, the former Minnesota skipper, was ejected in the bottom of the third by home plate umpire Hunter Wendelstedt for arguing balls and strikes, drawing cheers from Twins fans. It was the 79th ejection of Gardenhire's career.	The doubleheader was scheduled to make up a game that was postponed on April 12 because of blizzard-like conditions. Rain fell briefly during the opener. It was enough to send fans scurrying for cover, but the game was not delayed.	ROSTER MOVES	Detroit added LHP Gregory Soto from Double-A Erie as the 26th man for the doubleheader. Minnesota placed Martin Perez on the paternity list and recalled RHP Kohl Stewart from Triple-A Rochester to start the second game. The Twins added RHP Tyler Duffey as the 26th man.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: Detroit reinstated LHP Blaine Hardy from the 10-day injured list. He had been on the IL since April 22 with a left forearm strain. To make room on the 25-man roster, the Tigers optioned RHP Eduardo Jimenez to Triple-A Toledo.	Twins: Baldelli wasn't too worried about infielder Marwin Gonzalez, who suffered a facial contusion Friday during a collision with Detroit first baseman Niko Goodrum. Gonzalez sat out the opener but was expected to play the nightcap.	UP NEXT	Tigers: Soto was set to make his major league debut in the second game.	Twins: Stewart was set for his second start of the year with Minnesota.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.

ST. LOUIS --  Jordan Lyles had to change his plan on the fly.	Lyles overcame a 30-pitch first inning to combine with four relievers on a two-hitter, and the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the St. Louis Cardinals 2-1 Saturday for their seventh win in 10 games following an eight-game losing streak.	Lyles (3-1) allowed one hit through six innings, struck out six and walked three, lowering his ERA to 2.09, fifth-best in the NL.	With the Cardinals lying off of his curveball, the 28-year-old right-hander relied more on secondary pitches. He said he threw more sliders than he had in previous games this season.	"I've made strides in making that pitch better, which allows my other pitches to play up a little better alongside with throwing more elevated fastballs and occasional sinkers," Lyles said.	He battled through the first after a rain delay of 2 hours, 56 minutes, at the start. He struck out Matt Carpenter in a 10-pitch at-bat leading off, walked Paul Goldschmidt on a full count, retired Paul DeJong on a lineout that ended a seven-pitch at-bat, then struck out Marcell Ozuna in another seven-pitch at-bat.	"It's not the way you draw it up coming out of the blocks, but he was steadfast in his approach, his conviction with pitches and stayed in the hunt," Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said.	Lyles was removed after 101 pitches. He had been 0-1 with a pair of no-decisions since beating San Francisco on April 19.	"We were able to bounce back after the second, a couple of one, two, three innings," Lyles said. "It wasn't ideal to start the game off, but we bounced back in a decent way."	St. Louis' only hit off Lyles was an RBI double by DeJong in the third that glanced off the glove of right fielder Gregory Polanco as he jumped into the wall.	"I think there comes a point in time in a guy's career where they figure out who they are, they like who they are and they go out and pitch like who they are," Hurdle said. "I think Lyles got to that point last season."	Richard Rodriguez and Francisco Liriano combined on a perfect seventh, and Kyle Crick gave up a single to Goldschmidt around a pair of walks in the eighth, then escaped the bases-loaded jam by retiring Ozuna on a groundout. Felipe Vazquez pitched a perfect ninth for his 12th save in 12 chances.	After scoring 17 runs in the series opener, the Cardinals were held to one for the second straight day.	Polanco had an RBI triple in the fourth and scored on a single by Josh Bell, who extended his hitting streak to 11 games.	Cardinals starter Miles Mikolas (4-3) gave up three hits -- all in a row -- and struck out a season-high seven in seven innings. St. Louis has lost two in a row to the Pirates after winning its first three games against Pittsburgh this season.	"I think everyone's been trending in the right direction," Mikolas said. "Baseball cliche, sometimes the pitchers will pick up the slack. Sometimes the hitters will do that. Once we start clicking on all cylinders and doing everything right at the right time we'll be a very scary baseball club."	SLUMPING	Pittsburgh's Jung Ho Kang pinch hit in the eighth and struck out, extending his hitless streak to 23 at-bats since April 26 and dropping his batting average to .133.	STREAKING	DeJong was reached safely in all 22 home games for the Cardinals this season, getting hits in 20 of them.	WEB GEM	Cardinals 2B Kolten Wong made a sliding basket catch in short centerfield with his back to the plate to rob Bryan Reynolds of a hit leading off the seventh.	A CALL TO ARMS	Pittsburgh acquired 28-year-old right-hander Chris Stratton from the Los Angeles Angels for cash on Saturday. Stratton went 0-2 with an 8.59 ERA in five starts and two relief appearances for the Angels, then was designated for assignment on May 7.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: RHP Nick Burdi (right biceps/elbow pain) was moved to the 60-day IL to make room for Stratton on the 40-man roster.	Cardinals: RHP Carlos Martinez (right shoulder cuff strain) is to make his third appearance for Triple-A Memphis on Sunday. He pitched a scoreless inning with two strikeouts and a hit on Friday night.	UP NEXT	LHP Steven Brault (0-1, 7.11 ERA) is scheduled to make his second start of the season for the Pirates against the Cardinals and RHP Dakota Hudson (2-2, 4.63 ERA) in the finale of the four-game series on Sunday. Brault made his major league debut against the Cardinals in 2016 and is 0-1 with a 3.43 ERA in eight appearances against them. Hudson allowed a career high eight runs, though only two were earned, over five innings in a loss to Philadelphia on Tuesday.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

CHICAGO --  As the ball sailed to the left-field bleachers, Willson Contreras spun and tossed his bat toward the Cubs' dugout. He let his helmet go as he approached the plate, got mobbed by teammates and had his jersey ripped off.	The celebration was a long time coming, following a nine-inning stretch of scoreless ball in the Cubs' longest-ever home game against the Brewers. Contreras' 15th-inning homer gave Chicago a 2-1 victory over Milwaukee on Saturday.	Contreras turned on a 1-2 pitch from Burch Smith (0-1), sending a long shot to left that lifted the Cubs their 11th win in 13 games.	Contreras, who struggled in the second half of last season, is off to a strong start, batting .315 with 10 homers. He was understandably fatigued after catching 15 innings on a cool, rainy afternoon, but he still had enough to come through with the big hit.	"I feel good. That was something that I put my work on during the offseason," he said. "Just trying to have good at-bats. But right now, I'm more focused on calling a good game."	The game-ending drive was Chicago's third in five days. Kris Bryant hit a three-run homer in the ninth against Miami on Tuesday, and Jason Heyward connected leading off the 11th the following night against the Marlins.	"I know the type of power that he (Contreras) has and the threat that he is in that lineup," Cubs starter Cole Hamels said. "Especially when he's playing well and he's hitting the ball to all sides of the field, it makes him a lot more dangerous. Just to be able to see what he's able to do, especially after 15 innings of catching, I think that's what we were all talking about. I don't think he really wanted to go out there for a 16th inning."	The Cubs moved back ahead of the Brewers for the NL Central lead after falling into a virtual tie with Friday's 7-0 loss. Milwaukee had its season-high seven-game win streak snapped.	PITCHERS DOMINATE	Tyler Chatwood (2-0) struck out seven in four innings to cap a strong effort by the bullpen after Hamels worked seven solid innings.	Hamels gave up a run and three hits in his fourth straight no-decision. Seven relievers combined to give up one hit the rest of the way.	Milwaukee's Zach Davies held Chicago to one run and six hits in 6 1/3 innings. The right-hander lowered his ERA to 1.54 through eight starts. But the Brewers, who won an 18-inning marathon against the New York Mets one week earlier, couldn't push ahead.	"To play two in a week, yeah, not ideal," manager Craig Counsell said. "Came out on the short end this time. The pitching was awesome. It was tough to hit. Frankly the conditions were just miserable for the players out there on the field for both sides."	RECAP	Both teams scored in the fifth, with Hernan Perez hitting a homer and Albert Almora Jr. tying it in the bottom half with an RBI double .	The Cubs left the bases loaded in the 11th and again in the 13th, after Javier Baez led off with a double off the center-field wall that Lorenzo Cain seemed to think was heading out.	TRANSACTIONS	The Cubs activated left-handed reliever Xavier Cedeno from the 10-day injured list and placed right-hander Allen Webster on it because of an inflamed nerve in his pitching arm.	Signed in February, Cedeno had been sidelined since spring training because of inflammation in his left wrist.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: Milwaukee scratched surging slugger Ryan Braun from the lineup after he tweaked his left hamstring while running the bases in the previous game. Braun struck out as a pinch-hitter in the 12th. The Brewers hope to have him start on Sunday. The 2011 NL MVP had been on a tear, going 13 for 28 over his previous seven games, and he hit his 38th career homer against Chicago on Friday. ... RHP Chase Anderson (right middle finger laceration) is scheduled to start Monday for Triple-A San Antonio.	Cubs: C Victor Caratini will continue his rehabilitation from surgery to repair a broken bone in his left hand with Triple-A Iowa. Caratini began a rehab assignment Monday with Class-A South Bend. ... Manager Joe Maddon said he hopes to start INF Daniel Descalso (sore left ankle) on Sunday. Descalso has been limited to pinch-hitting since he was hurt running the bases against St. Louis on May 4.	UP NEXT	Brewers: RHP Jhoulys Chacin (3-3, 5.03 ERA) makes his first start at Wrigley Field since last year's NL Central tiebreaker, when he dominated in a 3-1 victory that gave Milwaukee its first division title since 2011.	Cubs: LHP Jon Lester (2-1, 1.41) tries to extend his string of dominant starts. The five-time All-Star has allowed three runs -- one earned -- over 18 innings in three appearances since returning from a strained left hamstring.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

BALTIMORE --  Now in his 19th major league season, Albert Pujols still has the power and bat speed to hit a baseball a very long way.	Pujols homered twice to increase his total to 641, had three RBI and scored three runs to help the Los Angeles Angels beat the Baltimore Orioles 7-2 Saturday.	Even at age 39, Pujols can carry an offense pretty much by himself.	"Others contributed, but Albert was the key contributor tonight," manager Brad Ausmus said.	Pujols hit a two-run drive in the first inning and a solo shot in the fourth. He also singled and scored in a three-run sixth that made it 6-2.	"One of the best right-handed hitters of all time, right?" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. "He is who he is because of what he did today."	Both home runs came against Dylan Bundy (1-5), who has yielded 11 long balls this season after serving up a major league-high 41 last year. Baltimore has allowed 83 homers, 19 more than any other big league team.	"Yeah, he got me twice today. You can't make a mistake to him and I missed my spot on both pitches," Bundy lamented. "Just a little bit on the first one. But the second one, I just lost command there and missed my spot by about a foot-and-a-half."	Pujols has played in 35 games this year and has eight homers and 21 RBI batting in the middle of the order.	"I have played well all season long," he said. "Been putting a good swing on the ball for month-and-a-half right now."	It was the 59th multihomer game of Pujols' career, the first since last July 12 against Seattle.	The slugger is 19 home runs short of matching Willie Mays for fifth on the career list. His 2,003 RBI rank third behind Alex Rodriguez (2,086) and Hank Aaron (2,297), and his three hits gave him 3,110 -- tied for 21st with Dave Winfield.	Shohei Ohtani had two hits and an RBI for Los Angeles in his fifth game this season. He's 4 for 21 since returning from the injured list following elbow surgery.	Matt Harvey started for Los Angeles and needed 93 pitches to get 12 outs. Luke Bard (1-1) followed with 1 2/3 scoreless innings.	Dwight Smith Jr. hit a two-run homer for the Orioles, who went 1 for 10 with runners in scoring position and stranded 10.	The last three innings were played in the rain before only a small portion of the announced crowd of 21,106.	SURGING DAVIS	Despite going 0 for 3 with a walk, Orioles first baseman Chris Davis is 17 for 58 (.293) with four homers and 14 RBI in 20 games since starting the season 0 for 33. "I just think he's got confidence now and is in a way better mindset to hit on a nightly basis," Hyde said.	Davis said: "I feel like I've made strides in the right direction really the last couple of weeks. ... Just really trying to see the ball and let it travel and put a good swing on it."	ROSTER MOVE	In a move involving right-handed relievers coming and going from Triple-A Norfolk, the Orioles optioned Evan Phillips and recalled Jimmy Yacabonis. "We just felt like it was a good time for Evan to go down and work on a couple things," Hyde said of Phillips, who gave up two runs on Friday night and has a 7.11 ERA.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: LHP Andrew Heaney (left elbow inflammation) is expected to make the second of three planned rehab starts in the next few days. ... Despite having four hits Friday night and owning a .390 lifetime batting average against Baltimore, Andrelton Simmons was rested until the eighth inning by Ausmus.	Orioles: LHP Richard Bleier (shoulder tendinitis) threw a shutout inning for Double-A Bowie on Friday and backed it up with a one-inning stint Saturday. He could be ready to join the team in a week or two, Hyde said. ... RHP Nate Karns (forearm tightness) is still a week to 810 days away from throwing.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  The A's have had an entertaining homestand, with three walkoff wins and the majors' first no-hitter this season in a five-day span.	About the only thing that went wrong was All-Star closer Blake Treinen's franchise-record streak of scoreless innings ending with a blown save -- and manager Bob Melvin doesn't seem too concerned about that.	Matt Olson scored from third base when right fielder Jordan Luplow slipped trying to field Ramon Laureano's short fly in the ninth inning, lifting the A's over the Cleveland Indians 3-2 in a wacky, sloppy game Saturday.	"I wouldn't say we're playing our best baseball right now, but to be able to stick out these close games and come out with wins this week has been big," Olson said. "To be able to win those tight games when you're not playing your best is what good teams do."	Olson walked leading off against A.J. Cole (0-1), and Kendrys Morales followed with a single before both runners were sacrificed over. Laureano lofted an 0-1 pitch over the head of second baseman Jason Kipnis, who was running toward right field. Luplow appeared in position to make the catch but slipped on the grass and fell as the ball dropped in for a single, allowing Olson to score easily.	Luplow pounded his hands into the grass while Olson threw up his arms as the A's -- sporting their Kelly green jerseys -- bolted out of the dugout to celebrate a second straight walkoff win. Matt Chapman homered in the 12th inning to sink Cleveland on Friday.	Had Luplow made the catch, Olson would have stayed put.	"I was halfway down the line," Olson said. "It was so shallow, I wouldn't have been able to tag and score, so I got about halfway off in case it dropped."	Treinen (2-2) won despite blowing his second save of the season after allowing Leonys Martin's two-out, tying single in the top of the ninth. That ended a streak of 32 consecutive scoreless innings at the Coliseum, a record for an Oakland reliever.	"Blake has picked up this team so many times," Melvin said. "We were able to come back and pick him up.	Cleveland's defense, or lack thereof, made the difference.	Both of Oakland's first two runs were unearned.	Nick Hundley hit a Little League home run in the fifth inning, tripling and scoring on a throwing error by left fielder Jake Bauers. Hundley connected on a 1-1 pitch from Trevor Bauer and never stopped running as the ball ricocheted off the wall in left. Hundley slid into third, but Bauers' two-hop throw was wide and skipped past third baseman Jose Ramirez.	The A's scored their first run following a throwing error by Ramirez in the first.	"You know on the road it's hard. If you make a mistake you end up going home," Indians manager Terry Francona said. "That's two nights in a row and it hurts."	The two unearned runs were the only blot on an otherwise strong outing from Bauer. The Indians right-hander allowed two hits, walked three and struck out 10 in seven innings. It's the 13th time Bauer has reached double-digits in strikeouts since the start of last season.	Martin homered for Cleveland. Kipnis, Luplow and Mike Freeman had two hits apiece. Ramirez walked twice, extending his on-base streak to 20 games.	Oakland won without hitting a home run for the first time in 15 games this season. The way the Indians played defense, the A's didn't need to.	Martin homered with two outs in the fifth after striking out in his first at-bat. Martin has struck out at least once in 20 consecutive games, the longest active streak in the majors.	FINALLY A SACRIFICE	Prior to Laureano's winning hit, Stephen Piscotty laid down a sacrifice bunt to advance both runners. It's the A's first sacrifice since Aug. 12, 2018. The 84 games in between sacrifices is the second-longest in major league history behind Toronto's 95-game streak 2002-03.	ROSTER MOVE	The Indians optioned RHP Cody Anderson to the minors. Anderson pitched three innings Friday night in his second start since Tommy John surgery in 2017.	TRAINERS ROOM	Indians: Tyler Naquin was scratched with a sore left calf. Luplow replaced Naquin in right.	Athletics: LHP Sean Manaea threw a 25-pitch bullpen, his second in five days after undergoing shoulder surgery last season. ... Melvin expects injured DH Khris Davis back in the lineup Sunday. Davis has missed three consecutive games because of a left hip contusion.	UP NEXT	The A's will call up RHP Daniel Mengden from Triple-A Las Vegas to start Sunday's series finale. Mengden was 3-2 with a 2.77 ERA in seven starts in the minors this season. RHP Jefry Rodriguez (1-2, 2.41) stars for the Indians. Rodriguez allowed two runs in six innings but lost against the Chicago White Sox in his previous outing.	--	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- The New York Yankees were frustrated by their play, and by slugger Luke Voit getting hit yet again.	Willy Adames and Ji-Man Choi had run-scoring infield singles in the sixth after tempers flared during the top of the inning when reliever Yonny Chirinos hit Voit on the left shoulder, and the American League East-leading Tampa Bay Rays beat the New York Yankees on 7-2 Saturday night.	Yandy Diaz homered twice and drove in four runs for the Rays, who reopened a 1½-game lead over the Yankees.	Voit was hit by Chirinos (5-1) one batter after DJ LeMahieu's tying solo homer.	"It's frustrating," said Voit, who didn't speculate on whether he was thrown at intentionally. "He can hit me anywhere else. This one is up and in. It's a situation that can be career-ending. He's a sinkerballer. and that was pretty straight."	Although there were no on-field incidents after Voit was hit, Yankees starter CC Sabathia went to the top of the Yankees dugout and yelled toward Tampa Bay players.	In his final start last season, Sabathia was ejected at Tropicana Field and given a five-game suspension for hitting Jesus Sucre with a pitch after Rays pitcher Andrew Kittredge threw a pitch behind Austin Romine.	"It's just the same thing, you hit a home run and then they throw up and in," Sabathia said. "It's stupid."	Voit has been hit five times; only Kansas City's Alex Gordon with eight has more among AL players.	Jonathan Holder (2-1) was warming up in the Yankees bullpen during the top of the sixth preparing to come in for Sabathia, who gave up two runs, three hits and four walks in five innings.	Avisail Garcia greeted Holder with a single and advanced to third on a stolen base and a throwing error by Gary Sanchez, whose seven errors are the most among big league catchers. LeMahieu, a Gold Glove infielder, could not get his glove down to receive the throw.	"I should have had Gary's ball," LeMahieu said.	Guillermo Heredia walked, and Garcia scored on Adames' single to LeMahieu, who was shifted and gloved the ball on the shortstop side of second base. LeMahieu made a sliding backhand stop on the outfield grass, but the ball popped into the air as he tried to throw. The left-handed-hitting Choi followed with a bouncer to LeMahieu in short right field and beat the second baseman's one-hop throw. Heredia kept running and scored from second on the hit as the ball bounced away from Voit at first.	Sanchez was hit hard on his catching helmet by Heredia's backswing in the eighth. Sanchez stayed in the game and underwent postgame tests.	"Feel good right now," Sanchez said through an interpreter. "Got to wait and see how I feel tomorrow."	With the Yankees' bullpen short after being used extensively the previous two days, manager Aaron Boone brought in Nestor Cortes Jr. in the seventh, the 36th player and 17th pitcher used by New York this season. The 24-year-old left-hander gave up a three-run homer to Diaz in the eighth.	Cortes was optioned to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre after the game, an indication right-hander Chad Green could be recalled after three appearances for the International League club to regain his mechanics.	Garcia homered in the second and Diaz added a third-inning shot off Sabathia, who has allowed eight homers over 30⅓ innings in six starts.	Diaz has nine homers. In parts of two previous seasons, he went deep one time.	"I've actually surprised myself," Diaz said through an interpreter. "I've never had those numbers in the past, but I'm swinging hard and I've been getting good results."	Clint Frazier hit an RBI double in the fifth, when Mike Tauchman into an inning-ending double play with runners at the corners.	DOUBLE CATCH	Tommy Pham made two catches on one play in the fourth inning. The Rays left fielder caught Brett Gardner's fly ball and then used his bare hand soon after to grab a contact lens that popped out. Pham, who went 0-for-4, was on the field postgame hitting balls at home plate off a tee.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: Center fielder Aaron Hicks (back strain), expected back Monday, went 3-for-4 with two doubles and a homer for Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. ... Shortstop Troy Tulowitzki (strained left calf) is scheduled to resume hitting and defensive drills during the upcoming week. ... Designated hitter/outfielder Giancarlo Stanton (left biceps/shoulder) is doing limited baseball activities. ... Sanchez was hit by Heredia's backswing in the eighth.	Rays: Right-hander Tyler Glasnow (6-1), who left his start Friday night in the sixth inning, is expected to miss four to six weeks with a right forearm strain. Glasnow will not throw for seven to 10 days.	UP NEXT	Yankees RHP: Masahiro Tanaka (2-3) will start Sunday's series finale against Rays LHP Blake Snell (3-3).	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Zach Eflin and backup catcher Andrew Knapp have a good thing going. Phillies manager Gabe Kapler isn't about to break them up.	Eflin became the majors' first pitcher with two complete games this season, lifting Philadelphia over the Kansas City Royals 7-0 Saturday night.	Knapp has caught Eflin's last three starts, and the 25-year-old right-hander has rolled right through them. He pitched nine innings of one-run ball two starts ago against Miami, then delivered seven innings of one-run ball last time out against Washington.	Now, this gem, Eflin's second career shutout and first since July 22, 2016 in his eighth major league start.	"I will say this, if he throws complete-game shutouts, I will not not have Knapp catch him the next time out," Kapler said.	Eflin (5-3) allowed four hits, struck out seven and walked none while throwing 110 pitches.	"There's so many guys that pitch away from contact in this game," Kapler said. "He's fearless. He's attacking the zone with all of his pitches."	Knapp and Eflin have played together since Double-A in 2015 and developed a strong chemistry.	"I think it goes a long way when a guy trusts his catcher the way Zach trusts me and that didn't come all at once," Knapp said. "That's been a long time coming with a lot of games played together, but we're definitely on the same page. All I'm doing is calling the pitches. He's the one executing it, so all the credit goes to him."	"He knows what I'm best at, probably moreso than I do," Eflin said.	Odubel Herrera doubled and tripled, and Andrew McCutchen and Rhys Hoskins each drove in two for Philadelphia. The Phillies worked seven walks, with every starter reaching base at least once.	Brad Keller (2-4) struggled with his command again, an issue that has plagued him all season. Keller walked four, hit one and threw a wild pitch in five-plus innings. The Phillies turned those free passes into six runs despite just five hits.	"I was yanking my head and pulling off pitches," Keller said. "We had a really good game plan going in. We didn't execute it the way we wanted to."	It was Keller's eighth consecutive start with at least three walks.	"He's fighting his mechanics, which in turn leads to him fighting his command," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "Walks hurt him, especially walks to the bottom-of-the-order guys. He's battling through it."	The top four batters in the Royals lineup each had one hit off Eflin, while the bottom five went 0 for 14.	"He hit a lot of corners. He was getting a little bit off the corners, too," Royals infielder Whit Merrifield said. "But when you're pounding the zone, you tend to get those good pitcher's pitches. He mixed it up enough. He didn't throw it over the white a whole lot. When you mix that with good stuff it's hard to hit."	Adalberto Mondesi stole his 13th base of the season and third over his last two games, breaking a tie with Tim Anderson of the Chicago White Sox for most in the majors.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: Philadelphia placed RHP Vince Velasquez (right forearm strain) on the injured list, retroactive to May 8. ... The Phillies recalled LHP Austin Davis from Triple-A Lehigh Valley. Davis made his only major league appearance this season on April 21, throwing two scoreless innings against the Colorado Rockies.	UP NEXT	Royals: RHP Jakob Junis (3-3, 5.52 ERA) will start the series finale Sunday.

PHOENIX --  Atlanta has a found lineup it can win with.	Brian McCann homered over the swimming pool behind the right-field wall, every regular had a hit, and the Braves beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 6-4 Saturday night to win their second straight after manager Brian Snitker reworked the order to put Ronald Acuna Jr. back on top and Dansby Swanson at No. 2.	"Sometimes you just need a little tweak here or there," said No. 3 hitter Freddie Freeman, one of four Braves with two hits. "We all know we have a great offense. Sometimes you can get into a little lull for a few days. What he did was pretty smart on his part. Today we woke up a little bit, and hopefully we can carry that into tomorrow."	McCann's homer made it 3-1 in the seventh inning. Atlanta's offense broke out after scoring 11 runs in its previous five games. The Braves had 13 hits.	"I like it," Snitker said of the new lineup. "We'll stay with it for a while."	Kevin Gausman (2-3) gave up one run and five hits in six innings. He escaped a bases-loaded, one-out jam in the fourth when Nick Ahmed flied out and Alex Avila grounded out. When the Diamondbacks loaded the bases again with one out in the sixth, Ahmed hit a sacrifice fly that cut Atlanta's lead to 2-1 and Avila struck out.	"I was throwing my fastball where I needed to," Gausman said. "I threw enough strikes to where they were aggressive enough to where I could throw my offspeed and not have to worry about throwing it for strikes."	Recovered from a calf strain that caused a stint on the injured list, Jonny Venters retired his only batter, David Peralta, on a game-ending groundout for his first save.	Arizona was 2 for 10 with runners in scoring position -- neither hit drove in a run -- and is 6 for 52 with runners on second or third in its last five games.	"It was a frustrating loss," Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said. "Early on, we got outside our approach. We came out of our game plan and weren't patient enough."	Merrill Kelly (3-4) allowed three runs and eight hits in seven innings.	Ender Inciarte beat a shift with a two-out, RBI single to left in the second.	Acuna opened the third with a 377-foot single off the left field fence before being forced out at second base, and Josh Donaldson hit an RBI single to double the lead. Acuna has a four-game hitting streak.	"He's getting really hitterish-looking to me," Snitker said of Acuna.	McCann homered off a curveball from Kelly in the seventh inning, one pitch after sending a fastball just foul deep down the right-field line. Adam Jones pulled Arizona to 3-2 in the bottom half with his second career pinch-hit homer, a drive off Josh Tomlin.	Nick Markakis and Ozzie Albies singled in runs off Archie Bradley in the eighth, and Blake Swihart hit a two-run homer against Tomlin in the bottom half.	Johan Camargo had a pinch homer off Yoshihisa Hirano in the ninth.	NO. 1 AT NO. 1	Acuna has 20 homers in 272 at-bats while hitting leadoff in his career, a homer every 13.6 at-bats. Since the live ball era began in 1920, Cleveland's Francisco Lindor leads major league qualifiers with a homer every 16.61 at-bats entering Saturday.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Braves: LHP Jesse Biddle (bruised right thigh, groin strain) has made three scoreless relief appearances for Triple-A Gwinnett.	Diamondbacks: RHP Taijuan Walker (recovering from Tommy John surgery in April 2018) is scheduled to throw another bullpen Sunday after a 23-pitch session Friday. If there are no setbacks, Walker could begin a minor league rehab assignment next week. ... Avila (strained left quadriceps) was activated from the injured list and started in his first game since April 5. ... 1B/3B Jake Lamb (strained left quadriceps) has incorporated light running into other baseball activities but is unlikely to be activated during the current homestead that ends May 19.	UP NEXT	Braves: LHP Max Fried (4-2, 2.97 ERA) starts Sunday after his previous outing was cut short in the second inning when struck on the left hand by a line drive.	Diamondbacks: RHP Zack Godley (1-2, 7.49 ERA) is expected to rejoin the starting rotation in the spot opened when RHP Taylor Clarke was optioned to Triple-A Reno on Tuesday.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

HOUSTON --  Gerrit Cole couldn't help but linger on a recent rocky outing against the Texas Rangers. It became fuel for the right-hander that ignited one of his best starts this season.	Cole struck out a season-high 12, Aledmys Diaz hit a grand slam while starting in place of injured star Jose Altuve and the Houston Astros beat the Rangers 11-4 Saturday night.	Cole allowed nine runs in 4 1/3 innings during a 9-4 loss to Texas on April 20. He wasn't shy about the fact that the start stuck with him.	"It was right there in the middle of my mind," Cole said. "I try to approach every game the same, and as far as my preparation and my adrenaline and my focus, it was the same, but there was just an intangible bad taste in your mouth from the last time. I just tried to control it and use it to my advantage."	Cole (4-4) was out for revenge. He gave up a run and four hits in six innings for his third straight win, and he has at least eight strikeouts in eight of nine starts this season. He leads the majors with 86 punchouts.	"When he has his aggressiveness from the very beginning of the game, he brings a lot of intensity," manager AJ Hinch said. "His fastball was incredible and so was his curveball."	Altuve was placed on the 10-day injured list after the game after suffering a left hamstring strain Friday night.	Diaz took Kyle Dowdy deep into the Crawford Boxes for a 6-1 lead in the sixth, and the Astros didn't look back. After Diaz realized the homer was gone, he pointed into the Astros dugout with a huge grin.	The Astros won their fourth straight game, handing Texas its fourth loss in five games, including three straight in Houston.	After Jesse Chavez started for Texas and retired all three batters in the first inning, Drew Smyly (0-3) made his first relief appearance since 2014. In 4 2/3 innings, Smyly allowed one run, four hits and four walks. He was pulled after walking the bases loaded before Diaz homered.	"I didn't make quality pitches, I just didn't do it when it counted," Smyly said. "I got two strikes I think on a couple of them. I just couldn't put them away."	Hunter Pence hit his seventh homer in the second inning over a leaping Josh Reddick to put the Rangers up 1-0. Pence has homered in four of the last five games, and he had another robbed by Reddick on Thursday.	"Gerrit Cole, I think he had a little chip on his shoulder after facing him the first two times, and we got him," Rangers manager Chris Woodward said. "We still had him at times, but we couldn't really stick to our game plan. He teased us a little out of the zone. It's easy for me to say that when I'm on the bench, but when he's throwing 98, 99 mph right at the belt or just above it, that's a really hard pitch to hit."	Michael Brantley tied it at 1 in the fourth with his 10th homer of the season.	Texas' Ronald Guzman hit a towering homer off Chris Devenski that trimmed Houston's lead to 6-4 in the seventh.	Houston answered with a three-run seventh, going back up 9-4 on an RBI single from Tyler White and a two-run single from Robinson Chirinos. The Astros added two more insurance runs in the eighth inning on RBI singles from Carlos Correa and Yuli Gurriel.	MCHUGH TO THE BULLPEN	Hinch said he was moving Collin McHugh to the bullpen. After a 3-1 start to the season, McHugh allowed 25 runs in his last four starts, going 0-3 in that stretch. His ERA has ballooned to 6.37.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: RHP Shawn Kelley (infection) threw a bullpen session on Saturday. Kelley has been on the 10-day IL since May 6 with a bacterial infection.	UP NEXT	Astros RHP Corbin Martin will be called up from Triple-A Round Rock to make his MLB debut in place of McHugh on Sunday. The Rangers will start RHP Adrian Sampson (0-2, 4.41).	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

DENVER --  Wil Myers had another big game at Coors Field.	Breaking out of a slump, Myers homered, singled and scored the decisive run in the San Diego Padres' 4-3 win over the Colorado Rockies on Saturday night.	"It's good to him," Padres manager Andy Green said of Myers' success at Coors Field, where he has batted .353 with nine home runs in 31 games. "Wil's a good hitter who at times gets really hot and he's gotten hot here a number of times."	Hunter Renfroe also homered, Greg Garcia drove in the decisive run with a bases loaded fielder's choice and Kirby Yates pitched a perfect ninth for his 16th save.	Myers had gone 3 for 33 (.091) in his 12 previous games before going 2 for 4 with two runs scored to help the Padres snap their five-game losing streak to the Rockies.	"That definitely helps the confidence, knowing that you can come up in a big spot and get something done," Myers said.	Trailing 3-2, the Rockies tied it in the bottom of the eighth when Charlie Blackmon homered off reliever Craig Stammen (4-1).	The Padres then scored against Wade Davis (1-1) in the top of the ninth. Myers beat out an infield single and Davis walked the next two batters to load the bases before Myers scored on Garcia's grounder, easily beating second baseman Garrett Hampson's throw home.	"I just didn't have good command. I probably would have been fine without the walks but the walks you definitely can't have," Davis said. "That's something we're going to have to stop doing. I'm just flying open a little bit and having a tough time with the release point the last couple of outings. It will be something that we can fix pretty quick and hopefully get back there tomorrow."	Yates, who leads the majors in saves, struck out three batters for his fourth straight appearance.	Renfroe broke up a scoreless game with his 10th home run of the season, a two-out solo shot in the Padres' fourth that sailed deep into the left-field bleachers. It was Renfroe's third career home run off Jon Gray in six career at bats against him.	San Diego went up 2-0 in its half of the sixth. Manny Machado singled and, after advancing on a wild pitch, scored on Eric Hosmer's single to right.	Colorado pulled within a run in the bottom of the inning. Trevor Story doubled off Joey Lucchesi, advanced to third on a wild pitch by reliever Gerado Reyes and scored on a sacrifice fly by Nolan Arenado.	San Diego regained its two-run lead when Myers homered off Gray to lead off the Padres' seventh. Myers' homer, his seventh of the season, reached the concourse beyond the left-field bleachers.	"It was great for him," Renfroe said. "Obviously, he's been going through a stretch there and he really needed that. He's been swinging the bat really well over the past two days so it's great to have an at-bat like that."	Colorado again pulled within one in its half of the seventh on Tony Wolters' RBI sing1e.	Gray went six-plus innings, allowing three runs and eight hits. He had eight strikeouts and a walk.	Lucchesi went 5 1/3 innings, allowing one run and three hits. He struck out four and walked one.	WHAT A CATCH	Besides driving in the go-ahead run with his bases-loaded grounder, Garcia made a spectacular sliding catch in the bottom of the fifth inning. He sprinted from his second baseman spot past the right field line into foul territory before hitting the dirt and snagging Hampson's arching foul pop near the railing. "That was the most incredible play I've seen in a long time," Renfroe said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: C Francisco Mejia was placed on the 10-day injured list because of a left knee sprain. C Austin Allen was recalled from Triple A El Paso to fill his roster spot.	UP NEXT	Padres: LHP Nick Margevicius (2-3, 3.47 ERA) is set to make his eighth career start in Sunday's series finale.	Rockies: RHP Antonio Senzatela (2-2, 5.67 ERA) will try to bounce back from a rough outing in which he allowed seven runs on eight hits, including a career-high tying three home runs in a loss to San Francisco. Senzatela is 0-2 with a 9.28 ERA in two previous starts at Coors Field this season.	---	More AP baseball coverage: www.apnews.com/MLB and www.twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

MINNEAPOLIS --  C.J. Cron's second home run on a long day turned out to be the bigger one.	Cron hit a three-run homer to break open the game in the fifth inning, and the Minnesota Twins beat the Detroit Tigers 8-3 on Saturday night to earn a split of a doubleheader.	In the opener, Cron homered in the eighth inning to tie it at 3-all, but Detroit's John Hicks went deep in the ninth to put the Tigers back on top, and Detroit won 5-3.	Cron went 5-for-8 on the day. His homer in the opener was a towering drive to right-center field, while in the nightcap he hit a scorching line drive that just cleared the left-field fence.	"Get a good pitch to hit, put a good swing on it, and whatever happens after that, I can't control that," Cron said. "It was nice to be able to find the seats."	Cron's blast in the nightcap off rookie Gregory Soto put Minnesota up 7-3, giving Kohl Stewart a cushion. Stewart (1-1) allowed three runs in six innings to earn the third victory of his major league career.	Marwin Gonzalez also homered for the Twins in the second game, and Eddie Rosario had three hits and drove in a run.	The Twins jumped on Soto (0-1), who made his major league debut after being called up from Double-A Erie as the Tigers' 26th man. Soto was charged with seven runs on nine hits in four innings, departing after Cron's homer.	Lefty Nick Ramirez also made his big league debut Saturday for Detroit. He relieved Soto and allowed one run in four innings.	"These kids get an opportunity like this and it's a big moment, something you'll never forget," Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire said. "Those smiles when they came out of the ballgame, that means everything in the world."	Designated hitter Miguel Cabrera was tossed in the first inning of the nightcap after yelling to the home plate umpire from the dugout.	EARLIER ACTION	In the first game, Ronny Rodriguez hit a pair of solo homers for the Tigers before Hicks' blast put them ahead for good.	Cron homered off Joe Jimenez (2-1), but Hicks followed by connecting on the first pitch from Trevor Hildenberger (2-2).	Shane Greene pitched a scoreless ninth to earn his AL-leading 14th save.	Spencer Turnbull allowed two runs in 5 2/3 innings for Detroit. He departed after Jason Castro's homer, which followed a successful challenge that backfired for Detroit. Castro took first base, appearing to be hit by a pitch from Turnbull. The Tigers challenged the call, and it was ruled the ball hit Castro's bat. He returned to the batter's box and launched his fifth homer of the season.	Michael Pineda started the first game for Minnesota and allowed three runs in six-plus innings. He gave up both of Rodriguez's homers and did not issue a walk for the second time in eight starts this season.	"I'm happy because I tried to pitch a quality game, and this was a quality game," Pineda said. "But at the end of the day, I'm not happy because we lost."	Gardenhire was ejected from the first game for arguing balls and strikes.	The doubleheader was scheduled to make up a game that was postponed on April 12 because of blizzard-like conditions. Rain fell briefly during the opener. It was enough to send fans scurrying for cover, but the game was not delayed.	ROSTER MOVES	Minnesota placed Martin Perez on the paternity list and recalled Stewart from Triple-A Rochester. The Twins added RHP Tyler Duffey as the 26th man. Both Stewart and Duffey were sent back to Rochester after the doubleheader.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: Detroit reinstated LHP Blaine Hardy from the 10-day injured list. He had been on the IL since April 22 with a left forearm strain. To make room on the 25-man roster, the Tigers optioned RHP Eduardo Jimenez to Triple-A Toledo.	Twins: Gonzalez, who suffered a facial contusion Friday during a collision with Detroit first baseman Niko Goodrum, sat out the opener.	UP NEXT	Tigers: LHP Daniel Norris (1-0, 3.47 ERA) will face the Twins for the second time this year when he starts Sunday's series finale.	Twins: LHP Perez (5-0, 2.83) returns from the paternity list to start Sunday.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Derek Dietrich got Cincinnati a lead, and David Hernandez helped the bullpen make sure it held up.	Dietrich singled in the tiebreaking run in the seventh inning, Hernandez struck out five in two perfect relief innings and the Cincinnati Reds beat the San Francisco Giants 5-4 Saturday night.	Eugenio Suarez and Yasiel Puig homered, and Dietrich hit a two-out flair against Reyes Moronta (1-3) that left fielder Mac Williamson couldn't grab despite a sliding effort, allowing Suarez to score from third to snap a 4-4 tie. Suarez doubled leading off the inning and took third on a passed ball.	Hernandez was among four Reds relievers who combined for five shutout innings of one-hit ball.	"We asked a lot of our bullpen tonight, and they delivered," Reds manager David Bell said.	Amir Garrett (2-1) pitched a scoreless sixth for the win. Raisel Iglesias threw a scoreless ninth for his eighth save in 10 tries as the Reds won their third straight game.	"Our preparation going into each series is something I've never seen before as far as just scouting and putting together a game plan," Hernandez said. "That's something that's just completely different from what we did last year, and so far it's working."	Reds starter Anthony DeSclafani gave up four runs in four innings.	Steven Duggar had three hits, including a two-run triple, for the Giants, who have lost three straight and five of seven.	Reds catcher Tucker Barnhart threw out Duggar trying to steal third with one out and two on in the seventh. The call was upheld after a challenge by Giants manager Bruce Bochy.	"I'm shocked it wasn't overturned," Bochy said. "Watching it on the board it's hard to tell, but I talked to our guys and no question he was safe. I don't know how they didn't overturn it.	"These are tough deals, they come from New York, but the word I got is no question he was safe."	Giants starter Jeff Samardzija had another rocky first inning against Cincinnati a week after allowing three homers on three straight pitches. This time, Puig hit a two-run shot during a three-run first inning.	Samardzija followed with three scoreless innings before being pinch-hit for in the fourth.	Samardzija struck out five, walked three and allowed five hits in a start that typified his season. The 34-year-old righty has given up 11 runs (all earned) in the first inning through eight starts. He has a 1.36 ERA in 33 innings after that.	Evan Longoria hit a solo shot off DeSclafani in the first. San Francisco has been outscored 40-3 in the first inning this season.	Longoria's sixth homer also broke the Reds' streak of 18 consecutive scoreless innings going back to Thursday's 3-0 win against Oakland.	The Giants took a 4-3 lead in the fourth, when Duggar's two-run triple highlighted a three-run inning.	Suarez homered leading off the fifth against Trevor Gott, his 12th.	"FAKE INJURY"	Giants left-hander Derek Holland, who gave up seven runs in 2 2/3 in Thursday's 12-11 loss to Colorado in his first outing since coming off the injured list (left index finger bone bruise), criticized the team's front office after a subsequent demotion to the bullpen, alleging he went on the injured list with a "fake injury."	Holland made his remarks after Saturday's game.	"To be honest I have no idea what they're doing," Holland said. "I don't mean that by Bochy and them, it's more the front office. They keep changing a lot of things, I did a fake injury. I'm not happy about that. But at the end of the day I'm going to do whatever they ask me to do."	MOVES	The Giants claimed OF Aaron Altherr off waivers from the Philadelphia Phillies. He's expected to join the team Tuesday and will be its fourth outfielder, manager Bruce Bochy said. The Giants designated right-handed pitcher Andrew Moore for assignment in a corresponding move.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: CF Nick Senzel and LF Jesse Winkler collided trying to field Duggar's one-out single in the sixth. Both players appeared to be shaken up but stayed in the game.	Giants: 1B Brandon Belt, who left Friday's game in the ninth inning with right knee inflammation, has been cleared to play after having an MRI taken Saturday. Belt, whose status remains day-to-day, pinch-hit in the ninth and struck out swinging for the game's last out. ... C Buster Posey (concussion list) played catch on the field Saturday. ... C Kratz (left hamstring strain) was reinstated from the IL. ... LHP Dereck Rodriguez was optioned to Triple-A Sacramento.	UP NEXT	Reds: RHP Tyler Mahle (0-5, 3.69 ERA) has a 1.62 ERA in 11 innings over his last two starts.

LOS ANGELES --  Gerardo Parra's signing is paying immediate dividends for the Washington Nationals.	Two days after signing with Washington following his designation for assignment by San Francisco last week, Parra hit a grand slam in his second game with the Nationals as they rallied for a 5-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Saturday night.	Parra's homer came in the eighth inning when he hit a fastball by Dylan Floro on the sixth pitch of the at-bat into the seats in right-center for his second home run of the season. It was his second career grand slam, and first since 2012.	"I'm very happy. It is a big moment for me," Parra said. "I just wanted to hit a pitch in the zone."	Parra has only 81 home runs in 11 seasons but hit his eighth against the Dodgers -- his most against one team -- and all but one have come in Los Angeles.	"To see Parra hit it over the wall that was just what we needed and gave us so much energy," Nationals starter Max Scherzer said.	The Nationals trailed 2-0 going into the eighth after Dodgers' starter Walker Buehler allowed only four hits. They loaded the bases with one out against Pedro Baez (2-2) and got their first run when Juan Soto drove in Wilmer Difo with a single after fouling off five straight pitches with a 1-2 count. It was Soto's first game back after he was activated off the injured list earlier in the day.	Scherzer (2-4) went seven innings and allowed two runs and five hits with seven strikeouts. His only mistake came in the third inning when he walked Max Muncy with two outs and then served up a fastball to Justin Turner, who homered to right-center. Sean Doolittle picked up his sixth save with a scoreless ninth.	"He's been pitching really well. For him to get a win was gratifying not only for him but for the club," Washington manager Dave Martinez said of Scherzer.	Buehler struck out seven in his first career start against the Nationals. It is the second consecutive game where he has gone seven innings.	Alex Verdugo had two hits for the Dodgers, who have dropped two of their last three at home after winning 10 straight.	"Can't say enough about what Walker did tonight. He was dominant tonight but unfortunately that eighth inning got away from us," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.	HOT STREAK	Turner has hit five of his six home runs in the last four games. In 13 games since April 26, the Dodgers third baseman is batting .377 (20 for 33) with six home runs and 12 RBI.	BACK IN LINEUP	Soto missed 10 games due to back spasms, but was able to pick up where he left off. He has reached base in his last 16 games and still leads the team in runs batted in (23) along with being tied for the lead in home runs with six.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: P Trevor Rosenthal (viral infection) began a rehab assignment at Double A Harrisburg. The right-hander struck out one in a scoreless inning. Martinez said he wants Rosenthal to refine his mechanics and gain confidence after he struggled the first month of the season. Rosenthal was 0-1 with a 27.00 ERA in seven appearances where he allowed 12 runs in three innings.	Dodgers: P Caleb Ferguson (oblique strain) will make another rehab appearance on Tuesday either at Triple A Oklahoma City or Class A Rancho Cucamonga. The left-hander tossed a scoreless frame at Rancho Cucamonga on Friday.	UP NEXT	Nationals: RHP Stephen Strasburg (3-2, 3.71 ERA) has struck out nine or more in four straight starts. He fanned 11 last Tuesday at Milwaukee but also allowed four runs in 6 2/3 innings to take the loss.	Dodgers: LHP Hyun-Jin Ryu (4-1, 2.03 ERA) has gone at least seven innings in his last three starts and threw a complete-game shutout against Atlanta on Tuesday. Ryu threw seven scoreless innings and struck out eight in his last start against Washington on April 21, 2018.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

BALTIMORE --  Chris Davis flashed a big smile when asked about recent strides in Baltimore's lineup.	Not long ago, the Orioles slugger looked like he was carrying the weight of the entire franchise on his shoulders.	Davis homered in his return to the cleanup spot in Baltimore's batting order, homering for the second time in three games to help the Orioles beat the Los Angeles Angels 5-1 Sunday and avoid a three-game sweep.	"It was nice being in the four-hole. It felt very familiar," Davis said.	Davis hit cleanup for the first time since Aug. 27. The 33-year-old, in the fourth season of a $161 million, seven-year contract, is batting .290 (18 for 62) with five home runs and 17 RBI since stopping a record 0-for-54 skid on April 13.	"I just like the way he's been swinging the bat," Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. "I was switching some things up and seeing what it looked like."	Davis homered off rookie Griffin Canning (1-1) leading off the second, and Stevie Wilkerson went deep two batters later. Dwight Smith Jr. hit a two-run homer in the third for a 4-1 lead, and Pedro Severino connected in the sixth against Noe Ramirez as the Orioles stopped a four-game losing streak.	Mike Trout hit his ninth home run and walked twice for Los Angeles.	Angels designated hitter Shohei Ohtani got the day off and Albert Pujols was 0 for 4 as the Angels' DH, lowering his batting average to .217.	Rookie John Means (5-3) allowed one run, four hits and three walks in six innings, throwing a season-high 110 pitches and lowering his ERA from 2.48 to 2.33. The Angels fell to 4-11 against left-handed starters.	"I feel good about it, but I definitely wasn't on," Means said. "Didn't feel great. Didn't feel like my fastball command was there. I was just lucky that I could throw my changeup and slider for strikes."	In a game that started 2 hours, 42 minutes late because of rain, Canning made his third big league start and gave up four runs, five hits and four walks in 4 2/3 innings.	"I made some good pitches, but they definitely jumped on mistakes," Canning said. "I liked my curveball a lot. It's something I worked on this week. My slider wasn't very good today.	MOVES	Angels: OF Peter Bourjos, who was designated for assignment last week, cleared waivers and was unconditionally released.	RUN DROUGHT	The Angels scored one or no runs in a game for the sixth time this season. They are 1-12 when scoring three or fewer runs.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: LHP Richard Bleier (shoulder tendinitis) had consecutive one-inning scoreless appearances at Double-A Bowie and is set to join Class A Frederick on Tuesday. "He came out of the back-to-back feeling good and on track to join us here at some point," manager Brandon Hyde said. ... Austin Hays (left thumb sprain) completed a stint at extended spring training and will play at Class A Frederick.	UP NEXT	Angels: Tyler Skaggs (3-3, 4.70 ERA) starts the series opener Monday in Minnesota. He allowed eight runs over 4 2/3 innings on Wednesday against Detroit.	Orioles: David Hess (1-4, 5.50 ERA) is to face the New York Yankees on Monday for the second time this season. He lost on April 7 after allowing four runs over five innings.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

BOSTON --  J.D. Martinez made hitting look easy even in the lousy weather conditions by belting his first two home runs of the season at soggy Fenway Park.	Martinez sent a pair of shots over the Green Monster, rookie Michael Chavis drove in five runs and the surging Boston Red Sox beat the stumbling Seattle Mariners 11-2 to complete a three-game sweep Sunday.	"Is that right?" Martinez said when informed they were his first long balls at home this year. "I didn't even know that. Definitely weird. I've always liked hitting here and always enjoyed playing in this ballpark. For that, definitely weird."	It was the fifth straight win and 16th in 22 games following a slow start for the defending World Series champions. Martinez, who has seven homers, finished with three RBI and scored three runs. Chavis hit three singles.	"We knew we could get to this point," Red Sox manager Alex Cora said. "It was just a bad stretch."	Omar Narvaez homered for Seattle (20-23), which has lost four in a row and 15 of 19 after opening 13-2. The Mariners were outscored 34-8 in the series, completing a 2-8 road trip.	Playing in steady light-to-moderate rain the entire time with temperatures in the mid-40s, the Mariners made five fielding blunders in the first three innings. Boston even had a few baserunners that appeared somewhat cautious in the conditions.	"It was tough," Martinez said. "It definitely wasn't baseball weather if you ask me, but we found a way to get it done."	Spot starter Hector Velazquez (1-2) gave up two runs in five innings for Boston.	Trailing 1-0, the Red Sox scored three runs with two outs in the first. Martinez got it started with his homer into the Monster seats off Marco Gonzales (5-2). Xander Bogaerts walked and Rafael Devers singled before Chavis hit a bloop to shallow right that second baseman Shed Long overran. Then he slipped and fell when he tried to retreat as the ball dropped in for an RBI single.	Devers scored on Narvaez's passed ball to make it 3-1, and he appeared to step gingerly on the slippery plate.	In the second, Seattle right fielder Jay Bruce dropped Mookie Betts' fly ball, allowing Andrew Benintendi to score to make it 4-1. Long also dropped a pop the next inning, but got a force out.	"Both teams had to play in miserable conditions out there," Mariners manager Scott Servais said. "Obviously, not a good series for us. Rough road trip. We've got to get back home and kind of regroup and go from there. But it was nasty, nasty conditions out there."	Chavis had a two-run single in the fifth, and another in the seventh. Martinez's second homer also cleared the Monster.	Gonzales gave up four runs, two earned, in four innings. He threw 95 pitches.	"I thought that the mound was OK," he said. "I thought it was a little muddy and sticky at times, but again, I don't think that's an excuse for the amount of pitches."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: Placed RHP Felix Hernandez on the injured list with a strained right shoulder.	Red Sox: Cora said LHP David Price (left elbow tendinitis) threw a bullpen. The manager said after the game that Price will throw another bullpen this week and could start for Boston over the weekend or next week. . Cora also said 2B Dustin Pedroia felt some minor soreness in his balky left knee and didn't play Saturday on his minor league rehab assignment. "In his own words, he was `just being smart," Cora said. "Hopefully, it's nothing."	OTHER MISTAKES	Seattle 3B Tim Beckham went near the seats trying to catch a foul pop and watched the ball bounce on the dirt. It was ruled no play by the official scorer. ... Boston 1B Steve Pearce booted a grounder.	EXTRA WORK	The grounds crew spread drying agent around the basepaths and mound, raking the areas many times. Plate umpire Quinn Wolcott did his part by wiping the plate with a towel.	"The grounds crew did an outstanding job," Cora said. "That was amazing for us to play all nine innings."	FIRST TIME OUT	Seattle RHP Parker Markel made his major league debut, giving up two runs.	UP NEXT	Mariners: LHP Yusei Kikuchi (2-1, 3.54 ERA) is set to start the opener of a two-game series Monday at home against Oakland.	Red Sox: Off on Monday before LHP Chris Sale (1-5, 4.50) is slated to start Tuesday versus Colorado. He fanned a season-high 14 over eight innings and allowed one run in a no-decision Wednesday at Baltimore.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

TORONTO --  Chicago White Sox pitcher Lucas Giolito might have let early adversity knock him off his game last year.	Not this season.	Giolito allowed one run in seven innings to win his second straight start, Tim Anderson and Yonder Alonso homered and Chicago beat the Toronto Blue Jays 5-1 on Sunday.	Giolito (4-1) gave up four hits, matched his season high with eight strikeouts and improved to 2-0 with a 1.64 ERA in his past four games.	"He just had everything going and worked extremely efficiently, so he was able to get deep into the ball game," White Sox manager Rick Renteria said. "He looked strong, even in the seventh."	Giolito pitched 7 1/3 shutout innings to beat Cleveland in his previous outing.	Four of Toronto's first seven batters got hits, including three of the first four, but Giolito allowed just two batters to reach after the first.	"He really set the tone for us," catcher James McCann said.	Giolito said he has been able to limit early damage by remembering to gather himself between each pitch when he's in a jam.	"That's a big, big thing for me this year, not letting innings get out of control," he said. "Last year, that's one of those innings that would probably get away from me. You know, give up three runs, put myself in a hole at the beginning of the game."	Rowdy Tellez had an RBI single in the first inning. Teoscar Hernandez hit a leadoff single in the second and Randal Grichuk walked to begin the fourth, but those were the only blemishes in a stretch that saw Giolito retire 20 of 22 batters.	"He kept his composure and did a really nice job," Renteria said. "He's maturing. This young man has done a lot to put himself in a better place and it's noticeable."	Ryan Burr and Aaron Bummer each pitched one inning to complete a four-hitter in the finale of a seven-game trip.	Toronto lost for the 10th time in 12 games and dropped to a season-worst eight games below .500. The Blue Jays have scored two or fewer in eight of their past 10 games.	"It's just that everyone is struggling at the same time," manager Charlie Montoyo said. "When you're down by four, it seems like 10. It's not a good feeling. That's were we are right now."	Anderson hit a three-run homer in a five-run fourth that included Alonso's two-run homer.	Aaron Sanchez (3-4) lost his third straight start, allowing five runs in six innings. He struck out 11, one shy of his career high, including five of his first six.	White Sox center fielder Leury Garcia stayed down after crashing into an unpadded section of the outfield wall as he hauled in Justin Smiak's deep drive in the third. Garcia finished the inning, but was replaced in the batting order by Carlos Rondon in the fourth.	Renteria said Garcia is day to day.	Toronto's Vladimir Guerrero Jr. doubled in the first, extending his streak of reaching safely to five plate appearances. Guerrero went 0 for 3 the rest of the day.	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox: OF Nicky Delmonico (left shoulder) was scratched from the lineup. Delmonico made a diving play in Saturday's game. ... McCann remained in the game after taking a foul tip off a groin in the seventh.	FLIPPANT	Anderson, who has developed a reputation for post-homer celebrations, said he wanted to flip his bat after going deep against Toronto in this series but didn't after connecting off Sanchez.	"I thought about flipping it there and then I heard Ricky (Renteria) say `Run," said Anderson, who had paused at the plate to admire his drive. "He kind of interrupted me a little bit."	Toronto's Grichuk exchanged comments with Anderson on social media last month after Anderson flipped his bat in a game against Kansas City, sparking a benches-clearing incident.	DOLLARS AND CENTS	The Blue Jays agreed Saturday to send $30,000 to Oakland for acquire RHP Edwin Jackson. Jackson, who had been pitching at Triple-A, is expected to start for Toronto at San Francisco on Wednesday.	CRIME DOESN'T PAY	Anderson was caught stealing second in the third, a call confirmed by replay review, the first time he was thrown out in 13 attempts this season.	FOUR AND MORE	The White Sox are 17-5 when they score four or more runs.	UP NEXT	White Sox: RHP Reynaldo Lopez (2-4, 6.38) starts the opener of a two-game series against Cleveland on Monday. Lopez faced the Indians in his previous start, allowing three runs in six innings.	Blue Jays: RHP Trent Thornton (0-4, 5.06) is scheduled to start Tuesday at San Francisco and RHP Tyler Beede (0-1, 18.69).	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Masahiro Tanaka and Tropicana Field were both lights out.	Tanaka outpitched reigning Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell, Thairo Estrada homered just after play resumed following a ninth-inning power outage and the New York Yankees beat the Tampa Bay Rays 7-1 Sunday to take two of three from the AL East leaders.	"Masa went out and set the tone for us," Yankees manager Aaron Boone said.	New York closed back within one-half game of the Rays. Despite 16 players going on the injured list the Yankees are 24-16, just four wins fewer than after 40 games last year.	"More guys just continue to step up," Boone said. "It's not easy for us right now. We've got to grind and scratch for everything."	Tanaka (3-3) matched his season high of seven innings, allowing one run and five hits with seven strikeouts and no walks.	"He's a wizard," Rays center fielder Kevin Kiermaier said.	Tanaka had his best splitter this season and threw it on 27 of 73 pitches along with 29 sliders, 15 fastballs and two sinkers. He gave up his only run when Austin Meadows homered in the sixth.	"Looking back a couple games, I think today was one of the best ones," Tanaka said through a translator.	Snell (3-4) struck out six of his first seven batters, getting eight swings and misses in the first two innings. He was perfect through three innings, getting seven strikeouts and throwing just 38 pitches	But Snell needed 30 pitches to get through the fourth inning, and New York went ahead in the fifth when Austin Romine and Michael Tauchman hit consecutive two-out doubles and DJ LeMahieu followed with an RBI single for a 2-0 lead.	Coming off a win Monday over Arizona in which he retired his first 17 batters, Snell struck out 12 in 5 2/3 innings, giving up two runs, four hits, two walks.	"With me not being able to keep us in the game and let the fifth inning happen, I can't allow that to happen," Snell said. "It's frustrating."	Ryne Stanek threw a run-scoring wild pitch in the eighth, and play stopped when the ballpark lights went out after Austin Pruitt threw his first pitch of the ninth to Estrada. At first, many in the stands turned their cellphone lights toward the field.	The Rays said in a statement the outage stemmed from the failure of a main switch in the building and that staff was able to reroute the electrical feed to an alternate switch temporarily.	Play resumed after a 43-minute delay, and Estrada hit Pruitt's second pitch after the resumption for a home run that boosted the lead to 4-1. Gio Urshela, who had struck out in his first four at-bats, added a two-run double and Brett Gardner a sacrifice fly.	"I've never been through something like that," Estrada said through a translator. "You've just got to keep your mind in a positive state."	Zack Britton got into a two-on, one-out jam in the eighth before striking out Ji-Man Choi and Yandy Diaz.	Chad Green struck out the side on 12 pitches in a perfect ninth, his first appearance for the Yankees since April 23. Green had a 16.43 ERA when he was demoted to the minors to work on his mechanics, and he made three appearances for Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.	"You definitely want to see instant results, especially after you struggle like I did," Green said. "It's nice to get back out there."	Catcher Gary Sanchez and shortstop Gleyber Torres were held out as the Yankees took a conservative approach with injuries.	Sanchez was hit hard on his catching helmet by Guillermo Heredia's backswing Saturday night in the eighth inning, but stayed in the game.	Torres played Saturday, one day after getting hit by a pitch on the right elbow. Boone said Torres "felt like he was a little sore throwing the ball."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: CF Aaron Hicks (strained left lower back) is expected to be activated from the IL on Monday. Hicks hurt his back during batting practice March 1 and needed a pair of cortisone shots. He went 3 for 4 with two doubles and a homer for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on Saturday, leaving him 3 for 18 in five minor league injury rehabilitation games. The RailRiders were rained out Sunday. ... 1B Greg Bird (torn left plantar fascia) was transferred to the 60-day IL to clear a roster spot for INF Breyvic Valera, who was acquired from San Francisco and optioned to Scranton.	Rays: 3B Matt Duffy (strained left hamstring) will resume an injury rehabilitation assignment Monday night with Class A Charlotte.	THE ROOKIE	C Anthony Bemboom started for the Rays and became the oldest position player at 29 to make his major league debut with the team. He was hitless in two at-bats.	UP NEXT	Yankees: RHP Jonathan Loaisiga (1-1) will go against Baltimore RHP David Hess (1-4) Monday night.	Rays: RHP Charlie Morton (3-0) and Miami LHP Caleb Smith (3-0) are Tuesday night's starters.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

HOUSTON --  George Springer started the Houston Astros' barrage and didn't let up.	Springer was 5 for 5 with four RBI and a pair of home runs that increased total to an AL-high 15, leading the Astros to a 15-5 rout over Texas on Sunday and a four-game sweep of the Rangers.	"It's one of those things where I think hitting is extremely contagious," Springer said. "If a guy sees someone else hit a knock, he wants to get one and the next guy wants to get one. I think the guys today did a good job of passing the baton on."	Springer hit his fifth leadoff homer this season and big league-high 29th since the start of 2015, a drive off Adrian Sampson (0-3). He hit an RBI single in the second, singled again in the fourth and fifth, then hit a two-run homer off the train tracks in left in the sixth against Brett Martin. It was his first multi-homer game since April 13 last year, also against the Rangers.	"He's got all sorts of levels he can go to," Houston manager AJ Hinch said. "He's in a really good place physically and preparation-wise. When he's getting pitches to hit, he's not missing them. He's doing a ton of damage, and it's so exciting when he's at the top of the order doing this stuff."	Springer became the first Astros player to have five hits and score five runs in a game.	"I'm happy to do it and happy to help us win," Springer said. "Me scoring runs means the guys behind me did their jobs as well."	Alex Bregman also homered twice and tied his career best with five RBI as the Astros set season highs for runs and hits (18). They extended their winning streak to five. Bregman hit a two-run homer in the second for a 4-0 lead and a three-run drive in the fifth against Ariel Jurado as Houston opened a 10-1 advantage.	"We had a great homestand with a lot of wins," Bregman said. "I'm super excited to see Springer go off today. Great offensive day."	Corbin Martin (1-0) struck out nine in his major league debut, allowing two runs, three hits and one walk in 5 1/3 innings.	Martin, selected with the 56th overall pick in the 2017 amateur draft, signed for a $1,178,600 bonus. The 23-year-old right-hander was 1-1 with a 1.48 ERA at Triple-A Round Rock this season.	"After I got that first pitch out of the way, I think it all settled in that I have been doing this for a long time, and I shouldn't change anything," Martin said. "It's easier to pitch when you have a big lead like that."Fans gave him a standing ovation when he was removed.	"I just told him there's only one first time," Hinch said. "He should be incredibly proud. I'm really thankful our fans sensed the moment and gave him an incredible ovation."	Isiah Kiner-Falefa and Elvis Andrus homered for the Rangers, who have lost five of six.	"We aren't happy with this result, but we've got to use this series as something to springboard off of as something to learn from and something to grow from," Hunter Pence said. "If you take all this valuable information, you can extract from these moments how we can improve."	Sampson allowed six runs -- five earned -- and nine hits in 3 1/3 innings, raising his ERA to 5.25.	"You have to set your standards higher," Texas manager Chris Woodward said. "Will you always get there? No. But when you have to take care of the baseball, execute pitches, have quality at bats and typically good things happen. When you don't do those things, you get exposed. Those are the kind of things good teams take advantage of."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: 2B Jose Altuve was placed on the 10-day injured list, a move retroactive to Saturday, due to a left hamstring strain. The Astros selected the contract of Martin from Round Rock.	UP NEXT	Rangers: RHP Shelby Miller (1-2, 7.48 ERA) starts the opener of a three-game series at Kansas City on Tuesday. Miller allowed two runs over four innings on Wednesday at Pittsburgh.	Astros: RHP Brad Peacock (3-2, 4.30) starts Monday at Detroit in the opener of a three-game series. Peacock struck out a career-high 12 in seven scoreless innings Wednesday against the Royals.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Daniel Norris rediscovered his rhythm, Nicholas Castellanos maintained his and the Detroit Tigers left Minnesota with a series split.	Norris turned in his longest outing since 2017 and, backed by Castellanos' three hits, led the Tigers to a 5-3 victory over the Twins on Sunday in the finale of a four-game set.	"I guess I re-found the delivery I was using in the spring," Norris said, "and it kind of got me back over my front side and kind of finished the ball better."	Castellanos, who hit a two-run homer, was a triple shy of the cycle. He and Brandon Dixon both homered early to back Norris (2-1), who went 6 1/3 innings and gave up two runs on six hits. He struck out five and walked one.	It was the left-hander's longest start since also pitching 6 1/3 innings on May 24, 2017.	"That delivery I found in the spring helped uptick my velocity a little bit more," Norris said. "I'm not really sure why I got away from that."	Ehire Adrianza homered and had two hits for the Twins, but designated hitter Nelson Cruz exited early with a left wrist injury. Cruz's final plate appearance came in the sixth inning and he was removed for a pinch hitter in the seventh.	Cruz said he will have an MRI on Monday.	Castellanos and Dixon both homered into the second deck in left field off Martin Perez (5-1) to give the Tigers an early 3-0 lead. Detroit has hit seven homers in its last three games. Five came during Saturday's doubleheader split.	"It's huge," Dixon said. "It's a tough series on the road, playing four games in three days. To get two, especially the way we did, I think we really battled and came through."	Perez gave up three runs and four hits in five innings with two walks and seven strikeouts. He was reinstated from the paternity list prior to the game following the birth of his son on Thursday.	Perez left in the sixth after being hit in the left foot by a line drive off Castellanos' bat. The Twins said he has a bruised left foot and is day to day. Perez said he'll be ready for his next start.	"I think it was a great game," he added. "We hit, but we didn't score so many runs. That happens. It's part of the game. We'll stay focused and move forwards and just come back tomorrow."	Niko Goodrum added a sacrifice fly and Miguel Cabrera had an RBI single in the seventh for the Tigers.	"I still would like to put up 10 runs and not have these two-run games, one-run games all the time," manager Ron Gardenhire said. "I hope, when the weather gets a little bit better, we'll put some better swings. We did early in the game today, put some really nice swings out there, and that's fun to see."	Castellanos has hit safely in 14 of his last 16 games. He's batting .318 (21 for 66) with four doubles, two triples, three homers and eight RBI in that stretch. Sunday was his 10th multihit game of the season.	Adrianza's solo homer came in the seventh, when Minnesota scored three times to cut Detroit's lead to 5-3 and left the bases loaded. It took the combination of Norris and relievers Victor Alcantara, Daniel Stumpf and Buck Farmer to get the Tigers out of the inning.	Shane Greene pitched the ninth for his 15th save in 15 attempts.	Byron Buxton had a season-high three hits for Minnesota, including an RBI single in the seventh.	"We had our opportunities and weren't able to put runs across early," manager Rocco Baldelli said. "We continued at it and had good at-bats late in the game and gave ourselves a chance to tie and maybe win the game. We had chances. It just wasn't our day."	A HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY	Ana Mercedes Astudillo, the mother of Twins catcher Willians Astudillo, threw out the first pitch. Willians Astudillo, who is from Venezuela, was reinstated from the 10-day injured list before the game. He batted leadoff and started behind the plate.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: RHP Tyson Ross (1-5, 6.11 ERA) is headed to the injured list with right elbow ulnar neuritis. . INF Harold Castro will be optioned to Triple-A Toledo. . INF Josh Harrison (bruised left shoulder) will be activated from the injured list before Monday's game against the Astros. Harrison was 2 for 3 with a walk in a rehab game at Class A Lakeland on Saturday night.	Twins: Astudillo missed the previous 14 games with a left hamstring strain. To make room on the roster for him and Perez, Minnesota optioned RHPs Fernando Romero and Kohl Stewart to Triple-A Rochester.	UP NEXT	Tigers: Begin a 10-game homestand Monday night when LHP Matthew Boyd (4-2, 2.86 ERA) starts against Houston RHP Brad Peacock (3-2, 4.30).	Twins: Host the Angels on Monday night in the opener of a three-game series. RHP Jose Berrios (6-1, 2.53 ERA) starts against Los Angeles LHP Tyler Skaggs (3-3, 4.70).	---	More AP MLB:https://apnews.com/tag/MLB andhttps://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Cole Irvin barely slept Friday night and was a nervous wreck Saturday. But when he showed up to Kauffman Stadium on Sunday, Philadelphia Phillies manager Gabe Kapler knew the 25-year-old lefty was ready for his major league debut.	"We knew he was poised, we knew he was aggressive, we knew he was confident," Kapler said.	Spotty showers, or "duck weather" as Irvin called it, couldn't dampen his debut. Irvin threw seven innings of one-run ball, allowing five hits with one walk and five strikeouts to lead the Phillies to a 6-1 win over the Kansas City Royals.	Philadelphia scored six times in the fifth to break the game open. Phillies catcher J.T. Realmuto hit a two-run double and Odubel Herrera followed with a two-run single to back Irvin (1-0).	"He stayed on the gas pedal the entire outing," Kapler said.	Seranthony Dominguez and Juan Nicasio each tossed a scoreless inning to close it out.	"Man, that was fun," Irvin said. "Big inning in the fifth, and just allowing J.T. to take me for a ride."	Kansas City has lost 12 consecutive series rubber games, a streak that stretches back to May 30 last year, when the Royals took two of three against Minnesota.	Irvin's strong start continued an impressive run by Philadelphia's rotation. Over their last 15 games, Phillies starters have a 2.36 ERA -- second-best in the majors during that span.	Royals starter Jakob Junis (3-4) cruised through four innings but fell apart in the fifth. After Nick Williams reached on an error with one out, Junis walked three of the next four batters, the last one chasing him from the game.	"I got away from my command a little bit," Junis said. "My fastball started to move a little more. Couldn't make a pitch when I was 3-2, fell behind in the count a little bit when I needed to get ahead and it just came back to bite me."	Realmuto greeted Richard Lovelady with a first-pitch double down the right field line, and Herrera hit his two-run single two pitches later. Herrera and Jean Segura each had two hits for the Phillies, and Andrew McCutchen was on base four times via three walks and a single.	Despite allowing just three hits, Junis was tagged for five runs due primarily to five walks. Free passes were an issue all weekend for Royals pitchers, who walked 18 batters during the three-game set.	"They're learning that if you try to be too fine, you're not going to be successful in this league," Kansas City manager Ned Yost said. "Either you can't throw strikes or you won't throw strikes, and neither one of them will keep you here long, or neither one of them are going to allow you to be successful. Our guys all can throw strikes. They've all got good stuff. They've just got to trust it."	Alex Gordon brought home the Royals' only run with an RBI single in the third. After the umpires initially ruled Billy Hamilton was thrown out at third base before Cam Gallagher crossed the plate, a replay review showed Hamilton beat the throw.	Hamilton and Gordon had two hits apiece for Kansas City.	SPECIAL TRIBUTE	Phillies slugger Rhys Hoskins, who lost his mom to cancer in 2009, added some extra decoration to his pink Mother's Day cleats. Hoskins wrote "Miss u mom" and the date she died on them, along with "humble" and "perseverance" near the toe. Both are words she instilled in Hoskins.	"Her will to live, her will to love, to be there for my sister and I, kind of embodied who she was as a woman and as a mother," Hoskins said. "She just would always remind me to make sure that I stay humble and that I'm a humble person. It was something that she always said to me and it stuck with me.	"I thought the shoes were a cool way to show love in a different way."	ROSTER MOVES	Before the game, the Phillies called up Irvin optioned LHP Austin Davis to Triple-A Lehigh Valley. Davis had been recalled on Saturday.	UP NEXT	Phillies: RHP Aaron Nola (3-0, 4.57 ERA) starts Monday night against Milwaukee in the opener of a seven-game homestand. Nola has given up just one run in each of his last three outings.	Royals: LHP Danny Duffy (1-1, 3.06 ERA) makes his fourth start of the year Tuesday night against Texas. Duffy held Houston to two runs over six innings in his last outing to earn his first win of the season.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ST. LOUIS --  Josh Bell put on a show for his mom on Mother's Day.	With his mother Myrtle in the stands at Busch Stadium, Bell homered and drove in a career-high five runs to lead the Pittsburgh Pirates to a 10-6 win over the St. Louis Cardinals on Sunday.	Adam Frazier added a two-run, tiebreaking pinch-hit double as the Pirates scored five times in the seventh inning and twice in the eighth to rally from a 6-3 deficit.	Pittsburgh has won six of eight, including the final three of its four-game series at St. Louis.	Pirates manager Clint Hurdle had warned Bell that he'd better come through.	"Jokingly, before the game, I said, `You need to do something special for Myrtle," Hurdle said. "He said, `Yeah, I've got this."	Bell went 4-for-4, extending his hitting streak to a major league-best 12 games. He reached base five times, including an intentional walk, and is 20-for-49 (.408) during the streak with four homers and 16 RBI.	"It was awesome," Bell said. "It's one of those scenarios where I know my mom would be just as excited to watch me play if I go 0-for-4. To be able to celebrate the win with (her) watching, it's unbelievable."	Myrtle lives in Louisiana and travels to see her son play at least once a month.	"His work ethic is one of the best I've ever seen," Pittsburgh infielder Kevin Newman said. "He's in the cage all the time. He works his tail off on defense. I couldn't be any happier for him."	Bell's three-run homer off John Brebbia (1-2) in the seventh tied the game at 6-6. Francisco Cervelli, who had three hits, followed with a double, Melky Cabrera drew a walk and then Frazier smacked a two-run double to right.	Paul Goldschmidt and Jose Martinez homered for the Cardinals, who have lost five of six and nine of 11.	Chris Stratton (1-2), acquired from the Los Angeles Angels on Saturday, worked a scoreless sixth for the win.	Brebbia (1-2) gave up three runs on three hits in one inning.	"When you make bad pitches to guys who are taking good swings, it's not going to be good," Brebbia said.	Colin Moran added two-run double in the eighth to conclude the scoring.	After the Pirates scored three times in the first, Goldschmidt hit a two-run homer off Steven Brault in the bottom half to start a four-run outburst.	Martinez, who went 3-for-5, had a two-run homer in the third. Bryan Reynolds made a leaping catch in the ninth to rob him of a possible second homer.	St. Louis starter Dakota Hudson gave up three runs on nine hits over six innings.	Brault, making his second start of the season, lasted 3 2/3 innings. He gave up six runs on nine hits.	Goldschmidt, who was 9-for-17 in the series, snapped an 18-game streak without a home run.	"We obviously haven't won as many games as we've wanted to the last 10 or 11 games," Goldschmidt said. "The focus is just to go out there and win the next one."	FULL HOUSE	The crowd was announced at 48,555, the largest in the history of the new Busch Stadium, which opened in 2006. It was St. Louis' fourth sellout of the season.	ON THE WAY BACK	Cardinals right-hander Carlos Martinez threw a scoreless inning on Friday for Triple-A Memphis. He has not given up a run in three rehab appearances covering three innings. Martinez has not pitched in the majors this season because of a right shoulder cuff strain.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: RHP Nick Burdi was transferred to the 60-day injured list. He has pain in his right biceps.	Cardinals: INF Matt Carpenter was held out of the starting lineup for a day of rest. He walked as pinch-hitter in the eighth.	UP NEXT	Pirates: RHP Nick Kingham (1-0, 5.94 ERA) will start in the opener of a three-game series at Arizona on Monday night. Kingham, who has nine appearances as a reliever and one as a starter this season, is 5-7 in 16 lifetime starts.	Cardinals: RHP Jack Flaherty (3-3, 4.32) will face Atlanta RHP Mike Foltynewicz (0-2, 5.94) as the teams begin a three-game series Tuesday. The Cardinals were shut out in each of Flaherty's last two starts.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

DENVER --  The sun broke through, and Charlie Blackmon came out swinging.	Blackmon homered twice, Antonio Senzatela pitched effectively into the seventh inning and the Colorado Rockies hung on to beat the San Diego Padres 10-7 on Sunday.	"I hit those balls pretty hard today, got some good pitches to hit," Blackmon said. "It's a little warmer outside, and seeing the sun for the first time in a while certainly helped, too."	The Rockies had one game rained out and plenty of cold, damp weather during a homestand on which they finished 4-4 as the skies cleared on Sunday.	Raimel Tapia had three hits, including a two-run homer, and pinch-hitter Daniel Murphy hit a three-run double for the Rockies, who took two of three from San Diego. David Dahl also had three hits as the Rockies put up double-digit runs in three of their last four games.	"I think we're doing a pretty good job, especially offensively right now," Blackmon said. "It seems like we're getting a lot of hits. I think we're competing really well."	Greg Garcia singled twice to drive in a pair of runs for the Padres, who lost a road series for the first time this season.	Senzatela (3-2) bounced back after allowing a season-high seven runs, including three homers, in a loss to San Francisco last week. He gave up three runs on four hits in 6 2/3 innings.	"I just made quality pitches today," Senzatela said.	Added Padres manager Andy Green: "He used a real good mix today and we didn't make the adjustment. He threw a lot less fastballs and used his changeup and curveball."	Senzatela struck out seven, including the first two batters he faced in the seventh. But Wil Myers and Austin Allen each singled -- it was Allen's first major league hit -- and Senzatela was relieved by Carlos Estevez, who surrendered successive singles to Dickerson and Garcia before inducing an inning-ending groundout from Reyes as the Padres pulled to within 5-3.	Colorado tacked on five more runs in the bottom half. With the bases loaded, Murphy lined a double down the first-base line off Brad Wieck. Tapia followed with his fifth homer, a drive into the center-field bleachers.	The Padres scored four times in the ninth, including a two-out, three-run homer by Franmil Reyes off Seunghwan Oh. Scott Oberg relieved and got Eric Hosmer to fly out to center.	Both of Blackmon's homers came off Nick Margevicius (2-4), who allowed five runs on eight hits in five innings.	"I threw him a 1-0 slider on the first home run and came back with a slider that was right over the plate," Margevicius said. "The second home run, I threw a fastball right over the plate on a 3-1 count. I fell behind on both home runs."	Colorado jumped on Margevicius for four runs in the second. Blackmon capped the burst by driving a 1-0 pitch into the second deck above the visitors' bullpen for a two-run homer.	He added a solo shot in the fourth, his first multihomer game of the season and the 11th of his career. Blackmon has eight homers this season, including three during the series, and has hit safely in 10 straight games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rockies: LHPs Jake McGee (left knee sprain) and Chris Rusin (mid-back strain) are both expected to pitch again Tuesday as part of their rehab assignments at Triple-A Albuquerque. Manager Bud Black said there's still no timetable for either player's return. ... LHP Tyler Anderson, who was optioned last week to Albuquerque, has told the club that he is still being bothered by a left knee injury. He went on the injured list last month with inflammation in the knee. Black said Anderson will see a nerve specialist Monday in Chicago.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Pablo Sandoval isn't getting regular at-bats these days, but he's making the most of his opportunities.	Sandoval homered and doubled in his second three-hit game this season, scoring the go-ahead run on Kevin Pillar's two-out single in the eighth inning to lift the San Francisco Giants over the Cincinnati Reds 6-5 on Sunday.	Sandoval hit a two-run, opposite-field homer to left in the first off Tyler Mahle that tied the score 2-2, his sixth home run this season. He singled in the sixth.	Sandoval was in the lineup at first base to give Brandon Belt, who is experiencing right knee inflammation, some extra rest.	Manager Bruce Bochy said Sandoval affords him that luxury.	"He's one of those guys who can sit and come up there and give you a good at-bat, whether it's pinch hit or he gets his starts," Bochy said. "The guy just has a knack for coming through when you need him."	San Francisco trailed 5-4 when Evan Longoria singled off David Hernandez (0-2) leading off the eighth. Sandoval doubled, Mac Williamson hit a run-scoring grounder and Pillar singled in front of center fielder Nick Senzel for his team-leading 22nd RBI. Sandoval slid home as the rookie's throw from about 260 feet was up the third-base line.	Sandoval also had a three-hit game at Toronto on April 23. He was released from a $95 million, five-year contract with Boston two years ago, and the Giants are paying him the $555,000 major league minimum.	Belt made a big contribution, too, coming in as a pinch-hitter in the seventh and hitting a tying, two-run homer -- his sixth -- on a hanging curveball from Mahle.	Reds manager David Bell said acknowledged he had Zach Duke available to face Belt, but he wanted to give Mahle a chance to get through the inning.	"We've talked about him getting stronger as the game goes on and we liked the way he was throwing," Bell said. "He'll continue to get opportunities like that."	Mahle allowed four runs and six hits in 6 1/3 innings. He is 0-5 in eight starts this season.	The Giants overcame three deficits on Sunday.	Pillar said the team's 12-11 comeback win against the Reds on May 3, in which the Giants rallied from an eight-run deficit, was a turning point.	"I think from that point on we've swung the bats real well, top to bottom," Pillar said. "It's just needed a timely hit once in a while, and today we got a couple of those."	Tony Watson (2-0) won despite forcing in the go-ahead run with a bases-loaded walk to Tucker Barnhart in the eighth. Will Smith struck out two in a perfect ninth for his 10th save in as many attempts, and the Giants avoided a three-game sweep.	Madison Bumgarner allowed four runs -- two earned -- and eight hits in six innings. He lowered his ERA from 3.99 to 3.88.	Senzel hit an RBI single in the second and Yasiel Puig homered for the second straight day, a sixth-inning drive that gave him seven this season. Jose Iglesias had a two-run single in the first.	MORNING MOHAWK	Puig arrived in the clubhouse Sunday morning sporting a platinum blonde Mohawk. "Between last night and this morning?" Bell said when asked if he'd seen Puig's new hairdo. "Wow, I haven't seen that yet."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: OF Jesse Winker, who missed two games last week with left quadriceps tightness, pinch hit in the eighth and grounded into a forceout.	UP NEXT	Reds: Sonny Gray (0-4, 4.15 ERA) is to pitch Tuesday's series opener against the Chicago Cubs. The Reds are 2-6 in his eight starts.	Giants: Rookie RHP Tyler Beede (0-1, 18.69) starts Tuesday against Toronto, seeking his first big league win. He allowed seven earned runs in 2 1/3 innings in his only start this season.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  Cleveland manager Terry Francona acknowledges the Indians are still uncertain what they have in Jefry Rodriguez after acquiring the 24-year-old pitcher from Washington in November.	They like what they've seen so far from the 6-foot-6 right-hander.	Roberto Perez hit a three-run homer in the sixth inning to back Rodriguez's first win in the American League as Cleveland beat the Oakland Athletics 5-3 on Sunday.	"I thought he battled like crazy," Francona said. "We don't know him great yet. He is obviously a really intelligent, thoughtful kid and he's not backing down from anybody. With this much inexperience it's not always going to be perfect, but it's easy to feel like the glass is more full. That's a compliment to the kid."	Francisco Lindor had two hits for Cleveland. Mike Freeman walked three times and scored, Carlos Santana had an RBI double and Jordan Luplow singled, scored and drove in a run.	Rodriguez (1-2) allowed three runs in six innings. He gave up six hits and three walks with three strikeouts, and got the A's to hit into a pair of double plays.	"I just try to always focus on executing and go out there and give my best," Rodriguez said through a translator. "There is some more confidence having that routine and being a part of the team on a daily basis. It helps a lot to give your best stuff."	Cleveland won after dropping the first two games of the series on walk-off hits. The Indians didn't give the A's a chance for a third, taking a lead in the first inning and pulling away on Perez's fourth home run.	Carlos Gonzalez and Luplow reached on consecutive one-out singles against starter Daniel Mengden (0-1). After reliever Ryan Buchter retired Jake Bauers on a liner, Perez drove a first-pitch fastball deep into the left field stands. The ball left his bat at 110.7 mph and traveled a projected 424 feet.	"A couple of the guys were talking to me, `Hey, be aggressive against this guy, he's going to try to steal a strike right away," Perez said. "I was being aggressive and I got it."	Rodriguez and three relievers made the lead hold up.	Adam Cimber struck out two of the three batters he faced. Nick Wittgren pitched the eighth and Brad Hand worked a 1-2-3 ninth for his 11th save. Hand bounced back after giving up a game-ending homer to Matt Chapman on Friday.	Matt Olson hit his first home run of the season for the A's. Olson was activated off the injured list Tuesday after missing the first 5 1/2 weeks recovering from right hand surgery.	Oakland finished 4-2 on its homestand.	"The offense still isn't where we expect it to be," manager Bob Melvin said. "It will come around. Now we go back on the road and hope the offense will pick up some."	Cleveland third baseman Jose Ramirez struck out, flied out twice and grounded into a double play. That ended his streak of reaching base in 20 consecutive games, which had been the longest in the American League.	THREE IN A ROW	A's catcher Josh Phegley has thrown out a runner in each of his last three games. It's the first time Phegley has done that since June 2015.	ROSTER SHUFFLE	The A's optioned right-hander J.B. Wendelken to Triple-A Las Vegas.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: Tyler Naquin (left calf) was rested.	Athletics: DH Khris Davis singled twice in his return to the cleanup spot after missing three games with a bruised left hip. ... Chapman was rested.	UP NEXT	Indians: RHP Shane Bieber (2-1, 3.32 ERA) is unbeaten in four road starts this season and will try to extend that streak Monday in Chicago against the White Sox. Bieber has walked two or fewer batters in five of his seven starts overall.	Athletics: Mike Fiers (3-3, 5.48) pitches Monday night in Seattle, starting for the first time since his second career no-hitter Tuesday against Cincinnati. Fiers lost to the Mariners on opening day in Japan.	---	More AP MLB:https://apnews.com/tag/MLB andhttps://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.

PHOENIX --  The Atlanta Braves wriggled out of one jam after the next with a series of spectacular plays.	Nick Markakis had the best of the bunch in the game's biggest moment.	Markakis made a diving catch with the bases loaded to rob Wilmer Flores and end the eighth inning, helping the Braves hold off the Arizona Diamondbacks 5-3 on Sunday.	"I was on Ender (Inciarte) and all of a sudden I saw Nicky dive and make that play," Braves manager Brian Snitker said. "It saved the game for us."	Atlanta's pitchers were in tight spots all day in the desert, starting with Max Fried's bases-loaded jam in the first inning.	Fried gave up Adam Jones' two-run homer in Arizona's three-run fourth inning, but the rest of the Braves' pitchers limited the damage of Arizona's 14 hits with a huge boost from their defense.	The tightest spot came with a one-run lead in the eighth inning, when the Diamondbacks loaded the bases with one out against Sean Holcomb.	He struck out Christian Walker and Dan Winkler got Flores to hit a diving ball to right field. The ball appeared as if it would fall, likely scoring two runs, but Markakis, a three-time Gold Glover, dove forward to make the grab.	"I don't know if I'm expecting them, but not surprised when they happen," Fried said of the spectacular defensive plays.	Fried (5-2) was hit on the left hand by a liner and had to leave in the second inning Tuesday against the Dodgers. The left-hander did not miss his turn in the rotation and allowed three runs on nine hits with seven strikeouts.	Joahan Camargo and Tyler Flowers each had two RBI, and Luke Jackson allowed two hits in two innings for his fourth save.	Atlanta has won consecutive series in Arizona for the first time since 2003-04 after holding the Diamondbacks to 1 for 9 with runners scoring position.	Jones reached 900 career RBI with his homer for the Diamondbacks, who stranded 11 runners to lose for the sixth time in eight games.	"We kept striking back and giving ourselves a chance to stay in this game," Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said. "Had some timely hitting, some good things were happening, but we just couldn't get that big hit at the right time, with runners in scoring position to really cash in."	Arizona's Zack Godley (1-3) was bumped to the bullpen after allowing at least four runs in four of his first six starts. His return to the rotation was more like a relief appearance.	Godley gave up three hits in the second inning, including Inciarte's RBI bloop single to left, and fellow starting pitcher Zack Greinke pinch-hit for him in the bottom half.	"I felt good, I threw pitches where I wanted to," said Godley, who expected to stay in the game longer. "I threw the ball where I wanted to."	Greinke, one of the best hitting pitchers in baseball, lined a single up the middle, but was stranded after left fielder Ronald Acuna Jr. made a leaping grab on Jones' hard-hit ball in the gap. Greinke is 2-for-4 in his career as a pinch hitter.	Camargo drove in two with a single and Flowers added a run-scoring single off Jon Duplantier in the third inning to put Atlanta up 4-0. The runs allowed were the first in five big league appearances by Duplantier this season.	GAUSMAN DROPS APPEAL	Gausman made two starts after being suspended by MLB, including a 6-4 win over Arizona Saturday night. He would be eligible to return to Atlanta's rotation on Saturday, giving him an extra day's rest.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Braves: 1B Freddie Freeman was a late scratch with a head cold and was replaced by Charlie Culberson, who went 3 for 4. ... Acuna was hit on the left wrist by a pitch from Duplantier in the third inning, but stayed in the game after being checked out by a trainer.	UP NEXT	Braves: RHP Mike Foltynewicz (0-2, 5.94 ERA) has allowed 11 earned runs in 16 2/3 innings heading into Tuesday's start against St. Louis.	Diamondbacks: LHP Robbie Ray (2-1, 3.30) needs six strikeouts against Pittsburgh on Monday to reach 800 for his career. He would be the second-fastest left-hander in games played (125) to reach the milestone, behind Frank Tanana (120).	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

LOS ANGELES --  Hyun-Jin Ryu has been dominant for the Dodgers since the start of last season. His latest gem nearly topped them all.	The left-hander took a no-hitter into the eighth inning and Corey Seager hit a grand slam as Los Angeles blanked the Washington Nationals 6-0 on Sunday to split a four-game series that featured three shutouts.	Gerardo Parra doubled with one out in the eighth for Washington's only hit.	"The past couple games I have been in a good rhythm," Ryu said through a translator. "I just try to use their weakness, be aggressive and attack the zone. I don't think about having no-hit stuff. It was about executing the game plan."	Ryu (5-1) struck out nine in eight innings and threw a career-high 116 pitches, 79 for strikes. He fired a four-hit shutout in his previous start Tuesday against Atlanta.	It was the second time Ryu carried a no-hitter into the eighth at Dodger Stadium. He held Cincinnati hitless in 2014 until Todd Frazier led off the eighth with a double.	"To watch him work as a technician, it was masterful. He wasn't stressed at all," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.	Ryu has tossed 25 straight scoreless innings and is 12-4 with a major league-leading 1.71 ERA since April 10, 2018. Opponents are batting .205 against him during that span.	As stingy as those numbers are, Ryu is even better at Dodger Stadium -- going 7-0 with a 0.90 ERA in his last seven home starts.	Seager, who drove in five runs, said he tried not to think about Ryu possibly closing in on a no-hitter, but it started to creep into his mind in the latter innings.	"Regardless, he was really special. Command, speed changes -- he mixed it up and those guys were off balance," Seager said.	Parra, who signed with Washington on Thursday, played Dodgers spoiler again. After hitting a grand slam Saturday night, he broke up Ryu's no-hit bid a day later. Parra drove Ryu's 105th pitch deep to left-center, where it bounced on the warning track and over the wall for a ground-rule double that ended up being Washington's only hit of the day.	Besides that, the lone Nationals baserunner was Brian Dozier, who walked with one out in the fourth. That was Ryu's first walk at home in 59 1/3 innings.	"He used both sides of the plate and we couldn't get anything going," Washington manager Dave Martinez said.	Seager broke the game open in the eighth with his second career slam on a fastball from Kyle Barraclough. Seager also had a sacrifice fly in the second that scored Cody Bellinger with the first run.	Stephen Strasburg (3-3) didn't allow a hit until Justin Turner singled with one out in the fourth. He scored on Alex Verdugo's grounder.	The right-hander yielded two runs and four hits in six innings. He struck out seven, marking the eighth time in nine starts this season he has fanned seven or more.	WEB GEM	Bellinger backed Ryu with an outstanding defensive play that preserved the no-hit bid in the sixth. Strasburg appeared to hit a line-drive single to right field, but Bellinger grabbed the ball on one hop and fired to first base in time to get Strasburg.	"I was just playing really shallow with Strasburg hitting. If there was a line drive at me, I was going to try to get one just because that's the only opportunity you have usually, with the pitcher. It's the perfect opportunity for it," Bellinger said.	Washington challenged the call, but it stood after a replay review. Bellinger said when he originally watched the replay on the scoreboard, he thought Strasburg was safe.	NOT TODAY	The Nationals have not been no-hit since the franchise moved from Montreal to Washington in 2005, a span of 2,306 games. The last no-hitter against the club came on July 18, 1999, when David Cone pitched a perfect game for the Yankees against the Expos.	STAY HOT	Bellinger had three hits to raise his NL-leading batting average to .407. It was his 18th multihit game of the season.	Bellinger is the first Dodgers player to carry a .400 batting average through 173 plate appearances in a season since Jackie Robinson in 1951. Robinson was at .400 through 190 plate appearances.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: INF Howie Kendrick was kept out of the lineup due to a stiff neck that has bothered him the past couple of days. ... SS Trea Turner (broken right index finger) did some light tossing before the game, but there is no timetable for his return.	Dodgers: LHP Scott Alexander has been dealing with a sore left hip. He faced one batter Saturday and allowed a hit.	UP NEXT	Nationals: Start a six-game homestand Tuesday against the NL East rival Mets. RHP Jeremy Hellickson (2-1, 5.52 ERA) went 1-0 in two starts versus New York last season.	Dodgers: LHP Clayton Kershaw (2-0, 3.31 ERA) makes his 36th career start Tuesday against San Diego to open a two-game series.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

CHICAGO --  Pitching in the rain for most of a cold Sunday night, Jon Lester gave the Chicago Cubs everything he had.	It was more than enough.	Lester worked his way through 6 2/3 innings, Kris Bryant hit a two-run homer and the Cubs beat the Milwaukee Brewers 4-1 to take a weekend series between the top teams in the NL Central.	Taking the mound a day after Chicago used seven relievers during a 2-1 victory in 15 innings, Lester allowed an unearned run and nine hits while throwing a season-high 116 pitches. The ace left-hander lowered his ERA to a major league-best 1.16.	"Same mindset. I mean, every time my day comes, I want to finish the game," he said.	The 35-year-old Lester (3-1) struck out six and walked one while becoming the first Cubs lefty to go three consecutive starts without allowing an earned run since Ken Holtzman in 1969.	"He's been so good at pitching through adversity, making pitches when he needs to," manager Joe Maddon said.	Bryant had three hits and scored three times, reaching safely for a career-best 22nd straight game and helping the division-leading Cubs close out an 8-2 homestand. Javier Baez collected two more hits, extending his hitting streak to a career high-tying 11 games.	Milwaukee wasted a solid start by Jhoulys Chacin (3-4), who permitted two runs, one earned, and six hits in six innings. The Brewers finished with nine hits, but left nine runners on base.	"Lester pitched really good. He made really good pitches, and they played really good defense, too," Chacin said. "I think when they needed today, they made those plays for him. At the end, we just couldn't get the big hit there."	After Baez's two-out RBI double gave Chicago a 2-1 lead in the fifth, Milwaukee put runners on the corners with no outs in the sixth. Lester wiggled out of the jam with some help from Baez, who cut down Jesus Aguilar at the plate when the big first baseman tried to score on Hernan Perez's one-out grounder to shortstop.	Lester departed with runners at the corners in the seventh, and Brandon Kintzler struck out Aguilar looking to end the inning. Kintzler also worked the eighth -- making an impressive grab on Ben Gamel's inning-ending liner -- and Steve Cishek finished for his second save.	"Great homestand," Bryant said. "Super proud of the way that we've handled everything that we've been dealt."	Bryant gave Chicago a 4-1 lead when he drove a 3-1 pitch from Adrian Houser deep to left-center with two outs in the seventh. It was Bryant's seventh homer in his last 15 games and No. 8 on the year.	"Bryant's home run late, obviously, was a big one," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. "Three runs in these conditions felt like a big lead."	ONE MORE TIME	The Brewers tied it at 1 in the fourth when Christian Yelich reached on a three-base error by left fielder Kyle Schwarber and scored on Aguilar's single.	Schwarber got turned around while going after Yelich's drive. He also committed an error that led to a run in Lester's previous start against Miami.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: OF Ryan Braun (sore left hamstring) was out of the starting lineup for the second straight day. He hit for Chacin in the seventh and grounded out.	Cubs: 1B Anthony Rizzo got the day off for the first time this season after his back tightened up during Saturday's marathon victory. The slugger has a history of back issues, and the Cubs are off Monday. ... 2B Daniel Descalso (sore left ankle) started for the first time since May 4.

PHILADELPHIA --  Bryce Harper made up for his offensive struggles with a spectacular, run-saving catch.	J.T. Realmuto doubled in the go-ahead run in the seventh inning, Cesar Hernandez hit a two-run homer and the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Milwaukee Brewers 7-4 Monday night.	Lorenzo Cain had a career-high five hits and Mike Moustakas homered for Milwaukee.	Harper struck out three times and was hitless in four at-bats but made a diving catch on Moustakas' liner to right field with two outs, the bases loaded and scored tied in the seventh.	"I'm just trying to play the best defense I can and not let my at-bats factor in," said Harper, who is batting only .222 after signing a $330 million contract. "You have to play both sides of the ball, stay focused on both sides. My pitchers need me."	The NL East-leading Phillies then rallied in the bottom half. Jean Segura struck out swinging but reached on a wild pitch by Matt Albers (2-2). Alex Claudio entered and retired Harper on a fly to center. Junior Guerra replaced him and struck out Rhys Hoskins. But Realmuto ripped a double to left-center to score Segura for a 5-4 lead. After Hernandez walked, Odubel Herrera extended the lead to 7-4 with a two-run double.	Neither starter was effective on a cold night following a 52-minute rain delay at the start.	Phillies ace Aaron Nola lasted only three innings, giving up three runs and five hits. He had given up just three runs combined in his previous three starts.	"I threw a lot of pitches, got behind guys, but the bullpen came in and did a nice job," Nola said.	Adam Morgan (2-1) got four outs for the win and Pat Neshek finished for his second save.	Brewers starter Freddy Peralta allowed two runs -- one earned -- and seven hits in four innings, striking out five.	Moustakas blasted a solo homer into the second deck in right field to give the Brewers a 3-2 lead in the third.	Cain's RBI double off Austin Davis increased the lead to 4-2 in the fourth. But Davis then pitched out of bases-loaded jam with no outs. Yasmani Grandal grounded into a third-to-home double play and Eric Thames struck out looking.	Christian Yelich's double and Grandal's triple each knocked in runs in the first.	"We had a ton of opportunities but there wasn't a hit that could break the game open," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said.	Nola helped himself at the plate in the second. With runners on second and third and one out, he worked a full count and then hit a grounder to shortstop. Thames dropped the throw to first for an error, allowing both runners to score and tie the game at 2.	REMEMBERING DAVID	The Phillies honored team chairman David Montgomery with a video tribute and his name was scripted along both foul lines. Players are wearing a patch on their uniforms with his initials. Montgomery passed away last week after a battle with cancer.	ROSTER MOVES	Davis was recalled from Triple-A Lehigh Valley before the game. The left-hander had been optioned Sunday after being recalled on Saturday.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: OF Ryan Braun wasn't in the lineup for a third straight game because of a sore left hamstring but had a pinch-hit single.	Phillies: RHP David Robertson was told by Dr. James Andrews not to throw for three weeks to allow the flexor strain in his right elbow time to heal. Robertson hasn't pitched since April 14. There's no timetable for his return, but he is expected to miss at least another month. ... RHP Edubray Ramos was placed on the 10-day injury list with right biceps tendinitis.	UP NEXT	RHP Brandon Woodruff (5-1, 4.25 ERA) goes for the Brewers and RHP Jerad Eickhoff (2-1, 1.50) starts for the Phillies on Tuesday night.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

DETROIT --  The surging Houston Astros were too much for Matthew Boyd.	Aledmys Diaz, Robinson Chirinos, Jake Marisnick and Alex Bregman homered for Houston, and the Astros beat the Detroit Tigers 8-1 on Monday night, extending their winning streak to six games. Two of those homers came off Boyd, the Detroit lefty who is off to a fine start this season but lasted only four innings in his shortest start of the year.	"We made him really work," Houston manager AJ Hinch said. "I looked up there in the third inning, he had 70 pitches. He got up into the upper 90s after four. We can do that to some pitching when we lock in the strike zone. We had a lot of foul balls."	Brad Peacock (4-2) allowed a run and three hits in five innings for Houston, which has won nine of its last 10 games. Boyd (4-3) yielded three runs and five hits and threw 96 pitches.	"My stuff was working, but they have a really good approach," said Boyd, who entered with a 2.86 ERA. "They are patient and they don't chase, so you have to be in the zone against them."	Houston got homers from its No. 6, 8 and 9 hitters before Bregman added his 13th of the year. The Astros scored three runs in a three-batter span in the second inning, then added two more in the seventh and three in the ninth.	"It's nice to see production top to bottom," leadoff hitter George Springer said. "They pick up the top of the lineup when the top of the lineup doesn't do its job."	Diaz hit a two-out solo shot to open the scoring in the second, and after a walk by Tyler White, Chirinos hit a two-run homer . Grayson Greiner hit a sacrifice fly in the fourth for the Tigers to make it 3-1.	Marisnick's two-run homer in the seventh gave Houston a four-run lead.	Ryan Pressly pitched the eighth for the Astros, extending his franchise-record scoreless streak to 36 innings.	Springer hit an RBI single in the ninth for Houston. Bregman followed with a two-run shot to left.	RETURN	Justin Verlander, the star pitcher who was traded from the Tigers to the Astros in 2017, was back at Comerica Park and is slated to pitch Wednesday. He talked before the game about Detroit's World Series defeats in 2006 and 2012, when the Tigers won the AL Championship Series with ease and then faced long layoffs before the World Series.	"It comes down to the hottest team at the right time," Verlander said. "I think we were that team twice, and just, we got cooled off by the week layoff before the World Series, both times."	BLOOPER	Detroit shortstop Ronny Rodriguez fielded two straight grounders to start the sixth. After making a nice play on the second one, he took off for the dugout, apparently thinking that was the third out. It was only the second, and he returned to his position.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: Marisnick was hit around the left elbow with a pitch in the ninth inning but stayed in the game.	Tigers: Detroit put RHP Tyson Ross on the 10-day injured list, retroactive to Saturday, with right ulnar nerve neuritis. The Tigers also reinstated INF Josh Harrison from the injured list, optioned INF Harold Castro to Triple-A Toledo and recalled RHP Zac Reininger from Toledo. Harrison, who had been out with a left shoulder injury, started at 2B and had a single and a double.	UP NEXT	Astros: Houston LHP Wade Miley (3-2) starts the middle game of this series Tuesday night.	Tigers: LHP Ryan Carpenter (0-1) takes the mound. He allowed six runs in five innings in his only start of the season so far.	---	Follow Noah Trister at www.Twitter.com/noahtrister	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

MINNEAPOLIS -- One week into Shohei Ohtani's return to the Los Angeles Angels, the lineup is looking sharp.	Minnesota ace Jose Berrios bore the brunt of their batting success on Monday.	Ohtani hit his first home run of the season, a towering two-run shot, in the third inning against Berrios, and Tommy La Stella hit the go-ahead homer in the sixth to give the Angels a 5-4 victory over the Twins.	"I've been hitting the ball in the air recently,'' Ohtani said through an interpreter. "I think it showed today that I'm improving.''	The Angels are 5-2 on this nine-game trip that started with Ohtani's 2019 debut following Tommy John surgery that has shelved the two-way Japanese sensation's pitching prowess for now.	"We've been waiting to get him back. You see how different the lineup is when he's in there, and hopefully he's starting to get his timing,'' La Stella said.	Ohtani reached base in four of his five plate appearances. His 429-foot drive off the videoboard facade beneath the second deck in left-center field was the highlight of a five-hit, three-run third. The AL Rookie of the Year homered 22 times in 326 at-bats in 2018.	"We all know the power's there, and that was a no-doubter to the opposite field,'' Angels manager Brad Ausmus said. "You don't see a lot of balls hit the other way from many people in this game that way.''	La Stella hit his team-leading 10th homer of the season and went 3-for-5. The 30-year-old second baseman, who came to the Angels in a largely unnoticed trade with the Chicago Cubs, had 10 home runs in 396 major league games entering this season.	Just as impressive as the power was the way the Angels beat the shifts employed by the Twins. Albert Pujols, who went 3-for-5, poked a single off an 0-2 curveball past the glove of Berrios (6-2) and through the empty right side of the infield in the fifth for a 4-2 lead.	Jorge Polanco and Marwin Gonzalez each hit two-run homers off Angels starter Tyler Skaggs (4-3), but the Twins weren't able to overcome the uncharacteristic vulnerability from their All-Star right-hander.	"Today was one of those days where the ball found open spaces against us, and that's just part of the game,'' said Berrios, who gave up five runs and a career-high 12 hits in 5 2/3 innings, his shortest start of the year, while walking three. He induced two ground ball double plays.	The Twins went 0-for-10 with runners in scoring position, including a fly ball by Mitch Garver with two on and two out in the fourth that left fielder Brian Goodwin caught with his glove stretched to the top of the wall and his back pressed against it.	"It's going to happen. I wouldn't be surprised if our guys bounce back well and have the same good at-bats they have been having all year tomorrow,'' Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said.	EGREGIOUS ERRORS	Although Ohtani's home run immediately after the gaffe rendered it moot, Gonzalez committed a two-base error when he slightly overran Mike Trout's line-drive single and allowed the awkwardly bouncing ball to skip past him into the corner as La Stella scored. This was Gonzalez's first career start in right field.	Pujols produced his own blooper for the Angels in the following inning, when he dropped a soft popup by Willians Astudillo to first base to put the leadoff man on in the fourth. Pujols followed fundamentals by putting both hands in place for the catch, but the ball still bounced off the heel of his glove.	HEATING UP	After a slow start, Gonzalez has a 1.042 OPS in his past 11 games. With third baseman Miguel Sano slated to return soon, Gonzalez will start moving around the diamond more.	"I don't have a favorite position. I enjoy what I do. I fell in love with what I do. I'm going to do whatever Rocco needs me to do,'' Gonzalez said.	SAME SIDE	Skaggs, David Fletcher and Griffin Canning of the Angels and Byron Buxton, Blake Parker and Mike Morin of the Twins are scheduled for a joint visit to a local children's hospital on Tuesday. When the Angels and Twins meet next week, players from both teams will again share cheer-up efforts at a children's hospital in Southern California.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: RHP Luis Garcia was placed on the 10-day injured list with a muscle spasm in his lower back. RHP Taylor Cole was recalled from Triple-A Salt Lake to take his place in the bullpen.	Twins: DH Nelson Cruz sat out with a sore left wrist, but an MRI test revealed no structural damage. He said he hopes to start swinging a bat on Tuesday or Wednesday, and he isn't expected to need a stint on the injured list. "I have to be a good kid. Just be patient,'' Cruz said.	UP NEXT	Angels: RHP Felix Pena (2-1, 3.21 ERA) will start on Tuesday after a one-inning opener was used in his past three appearances. Pena pitched seven shutout innings in his latest turn, allowing three hits and striking out seven without a walk in a win at Detroit.	Twins: RHP Kyle Gibson (3-1, 4.19 ERA) will take the mound in the middle game of the series, coming off his strongest start of the season. He gave up one run on two hits and one walk in six innings, with a career-high 11 strikeouts in a win at Toronto.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

CHICAGO --  Yoan Moncada admitted he was a little tired, and then chuckled at the whole thing.	"It's nothing," he said through a translator. "I'm just 23 years old. I can play."	No kidding.	Moncada hit two of Chicago's four solo homers and Reynaldo Lopez pitched 7 2/3 effective innings, helping the White Sox beat the Cleveland Indians 5-2 on Monday night.	Jose Abreu and Welington Castillo also connected for Chicago, which earned its third straight win. The White Sox improved to 4-3 against the Indians this season after they went 5-14 against the Tribe last year.	Chicago played on artificial turf in Toronto over the weekend, and manager Rick Renteria said it took a little out of his team. But Moncada's second career multihomer game and Lopez's longest outing of the season were enough to overcome any lingering fatigue.	Lopez (3-4) allowed one earned run and two hits, struck out six and walked two. It was the right-hander's first win since he fanned 14 in a 4-1 victory over Detroit on April 28.	"I have had good outings but today's was probably the best for the season," Lopez said through a translator. "I felt good. All my pitches were sharp today."	Francisco Lindor hit his 13th career leadoff homer for Cleveland, which lost for the third time in four games. Lindor also hit a sacrifice fly in the third, singled in the sixth and walked in the eighth, but that was pretty much it for the light-hitting Indians.	Lopez retired his last eight batters. Aaron Bummer got one out before Alex Colome finished the two-hitter for his eighth save in eight chances.	"We hit the ball hard today as a team. Seems like none of them dropped," Lindor said. "And then, when we had people on base, (Lopez) made good pitches. He was effective."	The White Sox went ahead to stay with two-out homers in each of the first three innings. Abreu hit his 10th homer off Shane Bieber (2-2) in the first, and Castillo went deep in the second. After Lindor's sacrifice fly tied it at 2, Moncada belted a shot to right in the bottom half for his eighth of the season.	Moncada homered again in the sixth, this time on a drive to left , and Yolmer Sanchez doubled in Castillo in the seventh.	Bieber allowed five runs and seven hits in 6 1/3 innings in the first road loss of his career. The right-hander was 9-0 with a 3.22 ERA in 15 appearances on the road coming into the day.	"I just need to be better with two outs," he said.	HITTING WOES	The Indians' two hits tied a season low. They also dropped to 4-12 when they score two runs or less.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: OF Tyler Naquin (left calf) was held out for the third consecutive game. "We were gonna play him tonight," manager Terry Francona said. "He went out and ran, and he just can't quite get over the hump so we're kinda re-evaluating it." If Naquin goes on the injured list, the Indians could bring up prospect Oscar Mercado from Triple-A Columbus. ... RHP Mike Clevinger (back strain) is scheduled for a bullpen session on Tuesday.	White Sox: LHP Carlos Rodon and RHP Nate Jones will miss the rest of the season. Rodon is scheduled for Tommy John surgery Wednesday in Los Angeles. Jones had surgery Monday to repair a flexor mass tear in his right forearm. ... OF Eloy Jimenez (high right ankle sprain) will begin a rehab assignment with Triple-A Charlotte on Tuesday. He could return to the White Sox before they begin a seven-game trip next week.	UP NEXT	Indians right-hander Carlos Carrasco (3-3, 4.91 ERA) and White Sox left-hander Manny Banuelos (2-2, 6.67 ERA) face each other again Tuesday night. Carrasco picked up a five-inning shutout when rain cut short Thursday's game in Cleveland, handing the Indians a 5-0 victory. Banuelos allowed five runs and eight hits in 4 1/3 innings.	---	Jay Cohen can be reached at https://twitter.com/jcohenap	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

PHOENIX --  After a three-game losing streak in which the Arizona Diamondbacks came up empty too often with opportunities to drive in more runs, hitting coach Darnell Coles changed things up in batting practice on Monday.	The emphasis on situational hitting worked hours later.	Eduardo Escobar homered, tripled and drove in three runs, Christian Walker also went deep and the Diamondbacks cruised to a 9-3 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates.	"It was more the things we worked on in spring training, kind of getting back to the basics of just getting a good pitch to hit, understanding what to do when you get a guy on second (base) with less than two outs," Coles said. "Trying to get something, or at least staying disciplined enough to get a pitch that you can do whatever job needs to be done."	Robbie Ray (3-1) overcame a rocky first inning to allow one earned run and six hits over five innings. He recorded his 800th career strikeout when he fanned Pirates pitcher Nick Kingham to end the top of the fourth inning.	Ray reached 800 strikeouts in 125 career games, the second fastest for a left-handed pitcher in terms of appearances to reach the milestone. He did it in the third-fewest innings pitched -- 664 -- according to the Elias Sports Bureau.	"Anytime you hit those milestones it means you're doing a lot right," Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said. "He's done that a long time, that's what it tells me."	David Peralta had two hits, including his National League-leading 16th double, and drove in two runs. Alex Avila reached base four times and drove in a run.	"When we got a guy in scoring position, we did our job," Peralta said. "It's always good to try something different. It worked really well today."	The Diamondbacks have a nine-game regular-season win streak against the Pirates and are 13-1 in the last 14 meetings.	Arizona rallied from a 2-0 deficit against Kingham (1-1). In his second start after opening the season in the bullpen, Kingham gave up seven runs and 10 hits in four innings.	"They put some good bat on the ball, laid off some really tough pitches, made me work. It's a tough lineup to face," Kingham said. "I feel that everything they were swinging at they were touching pretty good. One of those nights where it doesn't go my way."	The Diamondbacks' three-run second inning featured Escobar's two-run triple. He homered to right field in his next at-bat in the fourth.	Arizona scored in each of the first five innings, including on a balk by Pirates reliever Michael Feliz in the fifth.	Josh Bell, Bryan Reynolds and Melky Cabrera drove in a run each for the Pirates, whose three-game winning streak was stopped. Bell extended his hitting streak to a career high 13 games.	Walker's eighth home run of the season led off the bottom of the seventh, his first since April 22, also against Pittsburgh. All of his home runs this season have come in the seventh inning or later.	TUCKER COMES HOME	Pirates shortstop Cole Tucker started in his first major-league game in his hometown for the 22-year-old Phoenix native. Despite going 0 for 3 and striking out twice, he drew loud cheers from many in the crowd of 15,418, which was the smallest of the season to date at Chase Field.	SHERFY RETURNS	The Diamondbacks called up RHP Jimmy Sherfy from Triple-A Reno before Monday's game, after Jon Duplantier was sent down one day earlier.	It's Sherfy's second call-up to the majors this season, and he's appeared in parts of three seasons for the Diamondbacks. He entered Monday's game in the seventh and loaded the bases on threes straight singles, then struck out the next three Pirates to escape unscathed.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: INF Jung Ho Kang was placed on the 10-day injured list with a left side strain, and the Pirates called up former Diamondbacks utility man Jake Elmore from Triple-A Indianapolis. ... RHP Jameson Taillon (flexor strain) was transferred from the 10- to the 60-day injured list.	UP NEXT	Pirates: RHP Joe Musgrove (1-4, 4.20 ERA) seeks to rebound after allowing 13 earned runs in his last two starts. He had given up a total of six in the five starts before that.	Diamondbacks: RHP Luke Weaver (3-1, 2.98 ERA) has allowed one run or fewer in four of his last five starts, and has a win over the Pirates earlier this season.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

SEATTLE --  After a night filled with home runs, it was Daniel Vogelbach taking a close pitch to walk, Domingo Santana dropping a well-placed double and Omar Narvaez's opposite-field single that capped the Seattle Mariners' rally.	And all of it happened with two outs in the 10th inning.	Santana hit a tying RBI double and then scored the winning run on Narvaez's single, as the Mariners rallied for a 6-5 win over the Oakland Athletics on Monday night.	Ramon Laureano hit a solo home run with two outs in the top of the 10th, the last of Oakland's five solo homers, to give the A's the lead. But Seattle had one rally left, all of it coming with two outs against Joakim Soria (1-3).	Seattle snapped a four-game losing streak and won for just the third time in the past 15 games.	"The past couple of series haven't really gone our way and there are a lot of competitive people in here and we want to win really badly," Vogelbach said. "There was a lot of emotion in that game. I'm glad we came out on top."	Vogelbach, whose three-run homer in the eighth tied the score at 4-4, walked. Pinch-runner Dee Gordon stole second and jogged home when Santana hit a 2-2 pitch from Soria just fair down the left-field line to pull Seattle even at 5-all. Narvaez followed with a single to left field and Santana scored well ahead of Robbie Grossman's throw.	"I really felt down when they got the home run in the 10th and it feels pretty good to bounce back," Narvaez said. "I know we haven't been pretty good lately, but today was the beginning."	Oakland starter Mike Fiers and his bid for consecutive no-hitters had long been finished before the crazy 10th inning. Laureano homered on a 1-2 pitch from Brandon Brennan (2-2), his fifth home run of the season, and Soria was one strike away against Santana from recording the final six outs to get the victory.	"What really hurt me was the walk," Soria said. "Like I said, I was running a little bit out of gas, but it's part of baseball, it's part of the game."	Khris Davis homered twice for Oakland, ending a monthlong drought without a long ball for last year's AL leader. Davis hit his 10th home run on April 12 against Texas, but had none in his next 70 at-bats before golfing an 0-2 pitch into the left-field bullpens in the sixth inning. Seattle starter Yusei Kikuchi had retired 10 straight before Davis connected.	Davis hit his second home run leading off the eighth inning. It was his 25th career multi-homer game. Mark Canha, activated off the injured list before the game, homered leading off the second inning and Matt Olson ended Kikuchi's night with a homer leading off the seventh inning. It was the third homer for Canha and second for Olson.	Seattle trailed 4-1 entering the eighth before Vogelbach's second home run since April 20, jumping on the first pitch from Lou Trivino and hitting the 97 mph fastball out to center field.	A's manager Bob Melvin was ejected moments after Vogelbach crossed home plate for arguing with home plate umpire D.J. Reyburn. Melvin seemed particularly upset with a 3-2 pitch to the previous batter, Edwin Encarnacion, who walked.	"I mean everybody saw that. It had an effect," Melvin said.	NO-NO NO MORE	Less than a week after throwing the 300th no-hitter in major league history and second of his career, Fiers lost his bid for consecutive no-no's on the fifth pitch of the game when Mitch Haniger homered into the second deck of left field. It proved to be the only mistake Fiers would make, shaking off the rocky first inning to allow only two hits and one run over five innings before turning it over to Oakland's bullpen.	"After that inning I kind of settled down and started trusting my stuff and just getting back to me, just throwing strikes," Fiers said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners 3B Kyle Seager is set to begin a rehab assignment with Triple-A Tacoma on Tuesday after missing the entire regular season thus far due to hand surgery. Seager is eligible to come off the 60-day injured list on May 25.	ROSTER MOVES	Athletics: Oakland designated for assignment Kendrys Morales to make room for Canha. Morales was acquired from Toronto on March 27. The 13-year major league veteran appeared in 34 games and hit .204 with one home run and seven RBI with the A's.	Mariners: Seattle recalled RHP Austin Adams from Tacoma and optioning Dan Altavilla to Double-A Arkansas. Adams was acquired from Washington on May 4 after he was designated for assignment by the Nationals. Adams had a three-game stint with Washington in April and appeared in one game.	UP NEXT	Athletics: LHP Brett Anderson (4-2) is 1-2 with a 6.16 ERA in his past four starts. Anderson started the season 3-0, but has given up 13 earned runs in the past 19 innings.	Mariners: RHP Mike Leake (2-4) lost his last start despite allowing only one run over seven innings against the Yankees. He hasn't won since April 6.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

CHICAGO --  Jordan Luplow and the Cleveland Indians' anemic offense once again found the tonic they needed in Manny Banuelos and the Chicago White Sox.	Luplow hit two of Cleveland's five homers, Carlos Carrasco cruised through seven innings and the Indians pounded the White Sox 9-0 on Tuesday.	Roberto Perez, Jake Bauers and Jose Ramirez also went deep as the light-hitting Indians muscled up against Banuelos and Josh Osich to end Chicago's three-game winning streak.	The 25-year-old Luplow has hit all four of his homers this season against Chicago and three off Banuelos. His previous two drives against the White Sox left-hander came in a rain-shortened 5-0 win in Cleveland last Thursday. Luplow hit six home runs in brief looks the past two years with Pittsburgh.	"I don't know what it is, honestly," said Luplow of his success against Chicago and Banuelos. "It's a positive sign for our team that we can swing the bats, as long as we can stay consistent with it."	The Indians could use a kick-start. Cleveland entered hitting just .219, tied with Toronto for worst in the American League. The Indians also came in with only 36 home runs in 40 games, second lowest in the league and fourth lowest in the majors.	"We've been struggling a little bit, but it's in there," Luplow said. "We have a long way to go. I think this is something we can build off."	Carrasco (4-3) scattered six singles and struck out six, while walking none, in his second straight solid start. Oliver Perez, Dan Otero and A.J. Cole combined to complete the seven-hitter.	Banuelos (2-3) was roughed up for the third straight outing. The left-hander yielded five runs on four hits and three walks before leaving the game with none out in the fifth with a left shoulder strain.	Catcher James McCann said the Indians went deep off Banuelos' mistakes, but noticed the lefty wasn't his usual self.	"The crispness of this stuff wasn't quite the same," McCann said. "I know something was off."	Perez hit his fifth home run for a 1-0 lead in the third. Luplow's line drive barely cleared the fence in right-center in the fourth to make it 3-0.	The Indians added three more runs in the fifth.	Bauers led off with a homer and Perez then walked, prompting manager Rick Renteria and a trainer to visit the mound. Banuelos walked off with the trainer and Osich entered.	"He was just shaking his arm around a lot and something didn't seem right," Renteria said. "He said he felt something -- there was some soreness there -- so we took him out."	With two outs, Jason Kipnis doubled in a run and scored on Carlos Santana's single.	Luplow and Ramirez hit back-to-back homers to start the sixth to make it 8-0 before the Indians added an unearned run in the eighth.	NEWCOMER	Indians prospect Oscar Mercado made his major league debut in left field and batted sixth after being recalled from Triple-A Columbus earlier in the day. Mercado struck out swinging in his first three at-bats before being hit by a pitch and scoring in the eighth.	The 24-year-old was hitting .294 with four homers, 15 RBI and 14 stolen bases in 30 games in the minors.	Manager Terry Francona said Mercado's recall could be short-term while OF Tyler Naquin recovers from a left calf strain. Mercado was selected in the second round of the 2013 draft by St. Louis and traded to the Indians for two minor leaguers last July.	"I think we feel like this kid is a part of our future, and maybe in the meantime he helps us win a couple games that'd be great," Francona said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: Put Naquin (left calf strain) on the 10-day injured list, retroactive to May 11, and sent him to Cleveland for an MRI. Naquin, second on the Indians with a .278 batting average, hasn't played since Friday in Oakland. ... RHP Mike Clevinger (back strain) threw a 20-pitch bullpen session before Tuesday's game. ... Francona said RHP and ace Corey Kluber, whose broken right arm is in a cast, will be re-evaluated in three weeks.	White Sox: Banuelos will be re-evaluated on Wednesday. ... After hitting two of Chicago's four solo homers on Monday, INF Yoan Moncada got the day off, although he was available off the bench. ... OF Eloy Jimenez (right high ankle sprain) was set to begin a rehab assignment at Triple-A Charlotte on Tuesday night.	UP NEXT	Both teams are off on Wednesday. Indians RHP Trevor Bauer (4-2, 3.02) will start at home Thursday night vs. Baltimore. White Sox RHP Dylan Covey (0-2). 5.91 takes the mound in Chicago on Thursday night against Toronto RHP Marcus Stroman (1-6, 3.12).	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

CINCINNATI --  Kyle Hendricks had as many hits as he allowed in his latest gem.	Hendricks had a career-high three hits, including a two-run double , and worked into the ninth inning Tuesday night, leading the surging Chicago Cubs to a 3-1 victory over the Cincinnati Reds.	The Cubs are 10-2 in May, their best start to the month since 1977. Chicago has won 22 of 28 games for the NL's best record at 25-14. In this one, Hendricks (3-4) did it all .	He's found his stride in May, winning all three starts while allowing only one earned run in 25 innings. He gave up a pair of singles and Joey Votto's homer in the fourth inning, Cincinnati's only hits.	Shockingly, Hendricks also had a two-run double and a pair of singles.	"When I took him out, I said way to swing the bat," manager Joe Maddon said.	A .090 career hitter heading into the season, Hendricks spent time on his swing hoping to avoid being removed for a pinch hitter late in games. Still, he never expected anything like Tuesday night.	His RBI double put the Cubs in line for yet another win over Cincinnati. The liner over Nick Senzel's head in center field -- only Hendricks' second hit of the season -- made it 2-0 in the second inning. He added two more singles and lined out.	"It's something I really need to get better at," Hendricks said. "Honestly, I don't know what happened today."	The double came on a hanging slider by Tanner Roark (3-2), who lamented allowing the opposing pitcher to get a two-out hit that decided the game.	"You don't want to let those guys beat you," Roark said. "Tonight, I let it happen to me."	Hendricks left after walking Senzel to open the ninth on his 97th pitch. Steve Cishek got the last two outs for his third save in four chances.	Hendricks started his May surge with an 81-pitch, 4-0 complete game win over St. Louis and followed it by allowing one unearned run in eight innings of a win over Miami. In an era where starters throw in the upper 90s and often last only five innings, Hendricks is getting outs with his assortment of pitches and a fastball that was in the upper 80s in the later innings.	"He's definitely broken the mold," Maddon said. "He's definitely a throwback. You see weak swings and weak contact all night long."	The Cubs are 52-25 against the Reds over the last five seasons, the best mark by any team against a division foe.	Willson Contreras had a sacrifice fly for Chicago's other run. Kris Bryant had three hits and extended his career-best streak to 23 consecutive games reaching base safely. Javier Baez singled twice and extended his hitting streak to a career-high 12 games, the longest by a Cub this season.	The Reds came into the game with the NL's worst team batting average at .216. They were no-hit in Oakland by Mike Fiers a week earlier.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: Anthony Rizzo was out of the lineup for the second straight game with a stiff back that was improving but could sideline him for another game.	Reds: Jesse Winker was back in left field after missing two games last week with a sore left thigh. He went 0 for 4.	STILL GETTING ON	Bryant's streak of reaching safely in 23 straight games is the longest active streak in the majors and the longest by a Cub since Ben Zobrist reached safely 25 consecutive games in 2017.	NICE PLAYS	Hendricks applauded after center fielder Albert Almora Jr. went to the wall to grab Derek Dietrich's fly in the fifth. Second baseman Daniel Descalso made a diving stop on Tucker Barnhart's up-the-middle grounder and threw out the catcher to end the inning.	TAKE THAT	The Reds used a shift against Descalso in the second inning, and he bunted to the vacated left side of the infield for a single and scored on Hendricks' double. The next time up, the Reds left third baseman Eugenio Suarez in place.	UP NEXT	Cubs: Yu Darvish (2-3) walked six batters in four innings of a 4-1 win over Miami in his last start. He's 2-0 in three career starts against the Reds with a 1.93 ERA.	Reds: Sonny Gray (0-4) makes his ninth try to get his first win with the Reds, who got him in a trade with the Yankees. The Reds are 2-6 in his starts.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

WASHINGTON --  With a man on and one out in the first, Robinson Cano hit a simple little grounder, destined to end the inning. Well, it probably would have a week ago, when the New York Mets were losing four games in a row and nothing was going their way.	"Right off the bat," Washington Nationals starter Jeremy Hellickson would say later, "I'm thinking, `double play."	So was everyone else in the ballpark. Except here's the thing: Backup shortstop Wilmer Difo's relay throw went awry, fourth-string first baseman Gerardo Parra stretched but couldn't hold onto the ball and the inning went on. Eventually, former Washington catcher Wilson Ramos hit a grand slam that helped the surging Mets beat the slumping Nationals 6-2 Tuesday night.	"We made them pay for a little mishap there," New York manager Mickey Callaway said, "and that's what you have to do when you're a good team."	Noah Syndergaard (3-3) took a no-hitter into the sixth as the Mets won their third consecutive game to get back to .500.	"They understood that we were disappointed in the way we were playing and it wasn't acceptable," Callaway said. "It is nice to win some ballgames and see the fruits of your labor, because they've worked hard for it."	And the Nationals? They lost for the 11th time in 15 games, fell to 2-12 in series openers and are 16-25 overall. In the NL, only the starting-from-scratch Miami Marlins have a worse record.	"That first inning bit us. It really did," Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. "Like I've said before, we've got to play clean baseball. We really do. Got to give us a chance."	Ramos connected with a low 80 mph offering from Hellickson (2-2) and sent it out to left for his second homer.	He never should have been at the plate in that spot, but Difo couldn't make the play.	Cano initially was called out, but that was overturned after a quick review. Pete Alonso followed with a single past Difo, and Hellickson walked Michael Conforto to load the bases, bringing Ramos to the plate.	"I probably rushed it a little too much. I didn't realize that the runner's probably not as fast as I expected him to be," Difo said through an interpreter. "What we need to try to do is take a step back, calm down and try to eliminate those errors, because they've been hurting us lately."	Syndergaard allowed two runs and four hits in eight innings, lowering his ERA to 4.74. The first hit he allowed was a single to right by Difo to open the sixth, and Victor Robles followed with a homer off a 98 mph fastball.	It was Robles' seventh homer of the season -- and third off Syndergaard.	"I take the same approach, same focus, to the plate with him," Robles said through an interpreter. "And the things happen -- and what comes, comes."	FOR STARTERS	Syndergaard repeatedly reached 99 mph on his 102-pitch evening and struck out six. "Pitching is a lot more fun when you just go out there and you don't think," he said. ... Hellickson went five-plus innings, charged with five runs and six hits.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: INF Jed Lowrie strained his hamstring while in the minors to work his way back from an injured left knee and will head back to Florida. The 35-year-old Lowrie will be reassessed in a couple of weeks.	Nationals: SS Trea Turner, out since April 3 with a broken finger, began his rehab assignment at Class A Potomac. ... 1B Ryan Zimmerman (right foot) participated in infield practice; he went on the IL on April 28.	UP NEXT	Mets: RHP Wilmer Font (1-0, 5.50 ERA) makes his second start of 2019. He was acquired him from Tampa Bay on May 6.	Nationals: LHP Patrick Corbin (3-1, 3.20 ERA) makes his third start against the Mets this season. Corbin has a 3.75 ERA with 13 strikeouts, three walks and three homers allowed in 12 innings against New York.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

PHILADELPHIA --  Brandon Woodruff kept pitching out of jams until a big lead allowed him to settle in.	Woodruff threw one-hit ball for six innings, Yasmani Grandal and Ryan Braun homered and the Milwaukee Brewers beat the Philadelphia Phillies 6-1 on Tuesday night.	The Phillies survived a scare when Bryce Harper made a sliding catch on a foul ball to right field and banged his left knee into the wall in the sixth. Harper came up limping but remained in the game and made an almost identical catch to end the inning. He received a standing ovation only to get booed after striking out again in the eighth.	"It's a little sore," Harper said, adding he doesn't know yet if he can play Wednesday.	Woodruff (6-1) allowed only an infield single to Jean Segura in the first, walked five and struck out five.	"Early on, it was a struggle with the walks," Woodruff said about allowing two runners in each of the first three innings. "The offense did a great job and I was able to pitch ahead."	Philadelphia's Jerad Eickhoff (2-2) gave up five runs and eight hits in four innings.	Grandal gave the Brewers a 3-0 lead in the second when he drove his seventh homer out to right-center.	Braun's two-run shot to center in the third made it 5-0. Braun has 25 career homers against the Phillies, including 14 at Citizens Bank Park.	"He does love hitting here," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said.	Segura's RBI single off Corbin Burnes in the eighth knocked in Philadelphia's only run.	Brewers second baseman Keston Hiura, the ninth overall pick in the 2017 amateur draft, was 2 for 3 with a walk in his major league debut. He lined a single off Eickhoff's back side in his first at-bat.	"I thought he ball was going to ricochet and I'd be out," Hiura said. "My feet felt so heavy running to first base."	Hiura's teammates helped him celebrate his first day in the big leagues by dumping ice on him in the shower.	"I hope it's the first of many ice baths," he said.	BRYCE'S SLUMP	Harper struck out twice and walked twice. He's hitless in his last 14 at-bats and heard boos after his last at-bat in the eighth.	NO STEALING	Phillies catcher J.T. Realmuto has already thrown out 14 runners attempting to steal, matching his total from last season. His career-high is 22 in 2016.	ROSTER MOVES	Hiura was recalled from Triple-A San Antonio and infielder/outfielder Cory Spangenberg was designated for assignment.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: 3B Travis Shaw was placed on the 10-day injury list with a right wrist strain. ... Braun was in the lineup for the first time in four games. He's been nursing a sore left hamstring.	Phillies: INF Scott Kingery was 1 for 3 in his first rehab assignment at Class-A Lakewood. Kingery has been on the injury list with a right hamstring strain since April 20. He played shortstop and is expected to play in the infield and possibly center field during his rehab stint.

BOSTON --  Chris Sale pleaded but did not push when manager Alex Cora told him his day was done.	Cora was not about to risk the health his ace left-hander, even after he struck out a career-high 17 over seven innings. Sale may have righted whatever went wrong during an 0-5 start, but Cora still went to the bullpen for the eighth, costing Sale the chance to chase the major league record of 20 strikeouts in a nine-inning game.	Even after the Rockies rallied to a 5-4 win in the 11th, Cora and Sale seemed comfortable saying the skipper made the right call.	"AC's got two handshakes, and you get one or the other. And you know which one is the `done' one," Sale said. "I'd love to have gone back out there, but as I said, I'll never question anything he does."	Sale became the first pitcher in major league history to fan 17 in a start of no more than seven innings. Boston pitchers combined to strike out 24, but the Red Sox had their five-game winning streak come to an end.	Sale, who isn't the most cheerful guy in the clubhouse even after a win, couldn't help but smile a little after this one.	"I love this game and to be able to have a chance at doing something like that is special," Sale said. "But at the same time, it's still a close game. You've got a job to do and you just try to hold it down when you can."	Mark Reynolds, whose fifth-inning double was the first runner allowed by Sale, drove in the go-ahead run with a two-out single in the 11th against Ryan Brasier (2-2).	"You never know what's going to happen. So I think all of us who were here tonight witnessed two walks, 24 strikeouts, but a Rockie win," Rockies manager Bud Black said. "We just stayed at it. Man, it was a hell of a game."	Sale struck out the first six batters and fanned eight through three innings. He dominated the Rockies with a firm fastball and sharp slider, topping his previous best of 15 strikeouts, which he had done three times.	The All-Star lefty sported his signature short-sleeves despite the 44-degree temperature at the start of the game and had a shutout through six innings.	Nolan Arenado's two-run homer in the seventh was one of only three hits the Rockies managed against Sale.	"I had terrible timing with giving up the runs I did," Sale said. "That was the one that got them back in this game and gave them a breath of fresh air."	Sale stopped the damage with three straight strikeouts, placing him within range of the major league record shared by Roger Clemens, Kerry Wood, Randy Johnson and Max Scherzer.	"That was fun to watch. First time I've been in something like that, you know, watching the strikeouts and watching the pitch count," Cora said. "We wanted him to go deep. He was amazing."	Boston fans chanted "We want Sale!" after the bottom of the seventh, but his night was done. When Cora told him he was coming out, Sale used his fingers to form the number 20.	Cora didn't bite and went to Brandon Workman, who allowed a double by Chris Iannetta and Charlie Blackmon's two-run homer with two outs in the eighth to give Colorado its first lead at 4-3.	Sale's 17 strikeouts were the most for a Red Sox pitcher since Pedro Martinez fanned 17 against Tampa Bay on May 6, 2000.	Mike Dunn (1-0) got the win with one inning of scoreless relief and Wade Davis got his seventh save.	Michael Chavis, J.D. Martinez and Rafael Devers homered for Boston.	Boston made it 4-all in the eighth on a pinch-hit single by Mitch Moreland.	Chavis led off the second with his seventh homer, a 451-foot shot to left that survived a video review ordered crew chief Larry Vanover. Martinez and Devers added solo homers in the third to put Boston up 3-0.	Kyle Freeland got the start for Colorado on his 26th birthday and went six innings, allowing three runs on five hits, striking out seven and walking three.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rockies: LHP Tyler Anderson (left knee inflammation) saw a specialist Monday and will consult with team doctors about potential surgery, Black said. "I think a decision on some surgery is in the works here probably within the next couple days," Black said. ... Colorado recalled 3B Pat Valaika from Triple-A Albuquerque and optioned 2B Garrett Hampson to the Isotopes.	Red Sox: 2B Dustin Pedroia (left knee) remained in limbo after a rehab assignment was postponed over the weekend. Cora said Pedroia and the Red Sox are being careful not to rush the 35-year-old's return. "He'll go out there and then take grounders and move around and we'll decide what we do next," Cora said. ... LHP David Price (left elbow tendinitis) will likely throw another bullpen session Wednesday and could return to the rotation Saturday against Houston, Cora said.	UP NEXT	Rockies: RHP German Marquez (4-2, 3.43 ERA) has struck out 59 through 57 2/3 innings this season.	Red Sox: LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (4-2, 4.53) has won two straight starts and three of his last four.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

DETROIT --  The Houston Astros are making these games pretty enjoyable for their starting pitchers.	Carlos Correa started another Houston onslaught with a three-run homer in the first inning, and the Astros routed the Detroit Tigers 11-4 on Tuesday night, extending their winning streak to seven games. Wade Miley won his third straight start. This was the fourth time this season Houston has scored at least 10 runs in a game he pitched.	"It's like I'm a fan," Miley said. "It's like they should charge us a ticket price to sit where we sit and get to watch this."	The Astros, who have won 10 of 11, scored in each of the first six innings against a depleted Detroit pitching staff. George Springer hit an inside-the-park homer in the fifth, and Aledmys Diaz went deep in the third for Houston.	Miley (4-2) allowed four runs in six innings for the Astros. Houston led 7-0 after its half of the third.	Ronny Rodriguez homered for Detroit, but the Tigers are up against it this week. Not only are they facing the team with baseball's best record, but they also have a rotation beset by injuries. Tyson Ross and Jordan Zimmermann are on the injured list, and Michael Fulmer and Matt Moore are out for the season.	So Ryan Carpenter (0-2) took the mound for his second start of the season and allowed seven earned runs in four innings. After Correa's homer opened the scoring, Michael Brantley added a two-run single in the second. Diaz's solo shot made it 7-0.	Springer circled the bases in the fifth when his drive bounced off the wall and past center fielder JaCoby Jones. It was the first inside-the-park home run of his career, and Houston led 9-2.	"You can hit one to dead center field here and maybe have a chance to do a lot of funny things," Astros manager AJ Hinch said. "Pretty exciting play. We don't get to see it a lot, obviously, in our ballpark, but it's fun when it happens for us."	The Astros have scored 45 runs in their last four games. They outscored Detroit 19-5 in the first two games of this series.	"If you watched the last two games, it is pretty obvious that's a really good team," Tigers outfielder Nicholas Castellanos said. "That's the goal. We want to get ourselves to that spot, and these two days have shown we have a long way to go."	SNAPPED	Miley had allowed three earned runs or fewer in 24 straight starts, but Rodriguez's two-run homer in the sixth ended that streak. Miley's streak included all 16 of his starts last season and his first eight of 2019.	He allowed seven hits and two walks Tuesday, with five strikeouts.	"All in all, it was pretty good," Hinch said. "It wasn't his best, but it was certainly good enough, with the run support we had."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: OF Jake Marisnick got the night off after being hit around the elbow by a pitch Monday night . Hinch said Marisnick would play Wednesday.	UP NEXT	Astros: Former Detroit star Justin Verlander (6-1) takes the mound against his former team as the Astros go for a three-game sweep Wednesday night.	Tigers: Manager Ron Gardenhire said LHP Gregory Soto (0-1) would come up from the minors to start Wednesday, with Carpenter headed to Triple-A Toledo. Soto will be on short rest: He made his big league debut Saturday at Minnesota as Detroit's 26th man for a doubleheader. He was optioned to Double-A Erie, but will now come back.	---	Follow Noah Trister at www.Twitter.com/noahtrister	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

MIAMI --  Making a start 14 hours after a 5:30 am wakeup for a cross-state charter flight wasn't a problem for Charlie Morton. His pitches were working too well for him.	Morton threw six strong innings and Avisail Garcia homered and drove in three runs as the AL East-leading Tampa Bay Rays beat the Miami Marlins 4-0 on Tuesday night.	Morton (4-0) gave up three hits and struck out five while throwing 82 pitches before he was pulled for a pinch hitter in the top of the seventh inning.	"My sinker was playing pretty well tonight," Morton said. "They were pretty aggressive around the zone. They didn't chase a whole lot, but they were aggressive maybe on pitches that weren't hitters' pitches."	Garcia had a solo homer and two RBI singles for the Rays in the opener of the two-game series against their cross-state interleague rivals. The sparse crowd of 6,306 also featured a contingent of Rays' fans, whose "Let's Go Rays" chants increased as Tampa Bay scored its third run on Kevin Kiermaier's bases loaded walk in the eighth.	Garcia finished the scoring with an infield single with the bases loaded in the ninth.	"A healthy Avi Garcia can beat you in many ways," Rays manager Kevin Cash said. "Last year, he was battling injuries. But now he is 100% healthy. He hits the infield single to break the game a little bit more right there."	Garcia got the Rays on the scoreboard with a leadoff home run in the second. His shot measured at 471 feet landed on the corridor above the center-field wall for his seventh of the season.	"I didn't expect to hit the ball like that," Garcia said. "I've been feeling great since BP. I knew I hit it good. I knew right away it was out -- but not that far."	Garcia doubled the Rays' lead as he greeted Marlins reliever Nick Anderson with a single that scored Tommy Pham. Anderson inherited two runners from Miami starter Caleb Smith, who didn't last past the sixth inning for the first time since his opening start on April 1.	Smith (3-1) allowed two runs and four hits, while striking out eight and walking two in 5 1/3 innings. The Marlins lost their sixth straight and ninth in the last 10.	"We just have to keep grinding and eventually things are going to go our way," Smith said.	Relievers Emilio Pagan, Diego Castillo and Chaz Roe pitched the final three innings for Tampa Bay.	Miami was shut out for the eighth time and threatened only in the third after John Berti reached on a two-out infield single and advanced to third on Brian Anderson's single. Morton struck out Neil Walker to end the inning.	"We don't have that one or two guys somewhat in the middle of the order kind of banging for you," Marlins manager Don Mattingly said. "I know guys are getting after it but they're not measuring to what you'd like."	INCREASING THE PITCH COUNT:	Daniel Robertson struck out twice and walked once in his three plate appearances against Smith but made the Marlins starter expend his pitch count. Smith threw 26 pitches against Robertson, including a 13-pitch at bat in the fourth. Robertson was the last hitter Smith faced in the sixth as he worked a nine-pitch at bat before reaching on the first of his two walks.	"They had good at bats," Smith said. "They fouled pitches off and got me out of the game."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tampa Bay: Sidelined since opening day, INF Matt Duffy (left hamstring tightness) went 1 for 6 in three recent rehab assignments and is scheduled to play five innings Wednesday at Single-A Charlotte.	Miami: RHP Drew Steckenrider (right elbow inflammation) will visit physician James Andrews for a second opinion on his injury. Steckenrider, who split time between setup reliever and closer for the Marlins last season, was placed on the 60-day injured list last week.	UP NEXT	The Rays will go with Ryne Stanek (0-1, 2.57) as their opener in the series finale Wednesday. Stanek has started 10 games in 2019 but has not pitched more than two innings. Jose Urena (1-5, 4.82) will start for the Marlins	---	More AP MLB coverage: www.apnews.com/MLB and www.twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

ATLANTA --  It was difficult for Jack Flaherty to enjoy a runaway win over Atlanta because he couldn't avoid one bad inning.	Flaherty didn't have to worry. His St. Louis teammates roughed up Braves pitching all night.	St. Louis hit four home runs, including three-run shots by Marcell Ozuna , Yadier Molina and Kolten Wong, and the Cardinals beat struggling right-hander Mike Foltynewicz and the Braves 14-3 on Tuesday.	Flaherty (4-3) did not allow a hit through four innings. St. Louis led 11-0 before Flaherty gave up three runs and three hits in the fifth.	"Another long inning," Flaherty said, adding "I've got to stay away from that."	Cardinals manager Mike Schildt allowed Flaherty to remain in the game and finish strong with a perfect sixth inning.	"I was able to get through it," Flaherty said.	The 2019 struggles for Foltynewicz (0-3) continued. He gave up eight runs, matching his career high, while lasting only 4 2/3 innings.	Foltynewicz, a 2018 All-Star, saw his ERA climb to 8.02 in four starts. He began the season on the injured list with a bone spur in his right elbow. He insists his elbow is fine.	"It's really frustrating," Foltynewicz said. "It's nothing with the elbow or anything. We're past that."	Foltynewicz has allowed eight homers in 21 1/3 innings after allowing 17 in 183 innings in 2018, when he was 13-10 with a 2.85 ERA and 202 strikeouts.	Braves manager Brian Snitker said before the game he hoped Foltynewicz would be ready to find his top form after the late start to his season. Instead, the right-hander struggled from the first inning.	"Kind of everything is flat and not coming out real good," Snitker said. "He paid for it."	Ozuna's homer gave the Cardinals a 3-0 lead in the first. Dexter Fowler led off the fourth with a homer to right, and Molina's shot knocked Foltynewicz out of the game and was the big hit in a six-run fifth.	Wong added to the lead with his three-run homer off Jonny Venters in the ninth.	Atlanta's first hit off Flaherty in the fifth was Brian McCann's broken-bat dribbler against the defensive shift toward an abandoned third base. McCann scored on pinch-hitter Charlie Culberson's single to left. Ronald Acuna Jr. drew a bases-loaded walk off Flaherty to force in a run.	The Cardinals were shut out in each of Flaherty's last two starts. Bolstered by the big offensive support against the Braves, Flaherty allowed three runs on three hits in six innings despite matching his career high with five walks. He had six strikeouts.	St. Louis outhit the Braves 14-3. Every Cardinals starter, including Flaherty, had at least one hit.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: RHP Carlos Martinez (shoulder) is scheduled to throw 30 pitches for Double-A Springfield on Wednesday. If all goes well, he could join the team this weekend in Texas.	Braves: CF Ender Inciarte left the game with lower back tightness before the fourth inning and was being examined after the game. ... 1B Freddie Freeman started after missing Sunday's game with an illness and having Monday's off day for extra recovery time. Freeman was still sick, according to Snitker, who pulled the first baseman in favor of pinch-hitter Matt Joyce in the fifth.	HOME IN THE SOUTH	The Cardinals improved to 6-1 at SunTrust Park, which opened in 2017. They are 9-1 in their last 10 games in Atlanta since the start of the 2016 season.	BIDDLE RETURNS	Atlanta left-hander Jesse Biddle, activated off the injured list before the game, replaced Foltynewicz in the fifth and gave up four straight hits and a walk. He was charged with three runs while recording one out.	ROSTER MOVES	Atlanta right-hander Wes Parsons, who was recalled from Triple-A Gwinnett, pitched three scoreless innings. Left-hander Jerry Blevins was designated for assignment.	UP NEXT	Cardinals: RHP Michael Wacha (3-0, 5.35) is 0-2 in five career games, including three starts, against the Braves entering Wednesday night's game. He allowed two runs in a no-decision in his only previous start at SunTrust Park in May 7, 2017.	Braves: RHP Mike Soroka (3-1, 1.21) has allowed only four earned runs in five starts this season entering his first career start against St. Louis.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Mitch Garver demonstrated his value to the Minnesota Twins again Tuesday night against the Los Angeles Angels. Now, Minnesota is hoping it hasn't lost its surprisingly productive catcher for an extended period.	Garver hit a two-run homer and tagged out Shohei Ohtani trying to score the tying run in the eighth inning before leaving with a left high ankle sprain during a 4-3 victory.	Manager Rocco Baldelli said the team would know more about Garver's prognosis following additional testing Wednesday.	"Probably not in as much pain as I was expecting," Baldelli said. "But anything beyond that is speculation."	Garver homered in the third to give Minnesota a three-run lead behind Kyle Gibson (4-1). It was Garver's ninth homer and traveled to the second deck in left field. Byron Buxton added an RBI double the next inning, and five relievers combined for 3 1/3 scoreless innings, with Blake Parker getting his seventh save in seven chances.	Ohtani had three hits, including an RBI single as part of a three-run sixth, but he was thrown out at third base in the sixth and at home in the eighth after Brian Goodwin's single to center.	Garver, a breakout performer this season with a .329 average, took in Buxton's throw and applied the tag on Ohtani, then had to be helped off the field without putting weight on his left leg. Garver's foot twisted awkwardly as Ohtani slid into his leg. He was replaced the next inning by Jason Castro.	"Just the perfect throw to Garv was, I mean, obviously saved the game," Gibson said. "We're definitely worried about Garv. He's been one of our better players all year, and really consistent behind the plate, and hopefully everything comes back negative and he's fine."	The Twins lead the majors with 16 home runs and 38 RBI from the catching position, also getting strong contributions from Castro and Willians Astudillo.	"You can't fake what he is doing," Baldelli said of Garver. "He sees the ball. He makes great decisions on a pitch-to-pitch basis. He has tremendous at-bats. When you have at-bats like that and have a good, short stroke, it's a good combination and that's what he's working with."	Ohtani is batting .321 in seven games after missing the start of the season recovering from Tommy John surgery.	"I had to take that gamble," Ohtani said through an interpreter about the play at the plate. "I felt like I had a decent chance, but the results weren't the way I wanted."	Cam Bedrosian (1-2) took the loss for Los Angeles, serving as the opener for primary pitcher Felix Pena. Bedrosian gave up one run and two hits in one inning.	Gibson cruised through five innings before running into trouble in the sixth. He allowed three runs, six hits and two walks in 5 2/3 innings.	BOUR OPTIONED	First baseman Justin Bour was optioned to Triple-A Salt Lake after the game. He struck out in a pinch-hitting appearance Tuesday and is hitting .163 with four homers and 14 RBI in 30 games.	"I can't really say it's come as any kind of surprise," said Bour, who's hit at least 20 home runs in three of the past four seasons and owns a .255 career average. "Obviously, the beginning of the season hasn't clicked for me like I know I'm capable of doing. But it's one of those things where you have two ways of looking at it, and I'm looking at it as an opportunity to go down, figure some stuff out and get back as soon as possible."	BAT ON THE BALL	Gibson struck out Andrelton Simmons in the second inning, snapping Simmons' streak of 61 plate appearances without a strikeout, which was the longest active streak in baseball.	Astudillo struck out in the eighth after going 44 plate appearances without a strikeout. It was just the second strikeout for Astudillo this season in 64 plate appearances.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: Manager Brad Ausmus said he expects OF Kole Calhoun to return Friday. Calhoun was placed on the paternity list before the game and IF Luis Rengifo was recalled from Triple-A Salt Lake. ... RHP JC Ramirez threw a 45-point intrasquad game in Arizona on Tuesday as he works his way back from Tommy John surgery. ... LHP Andrew Heaney (elbow) will make a start in extended spring training tomorrow.	Twins: Nelson Cruz was out of the lineup for the second straight day as he deals with a sore left wrist. ... 2B Jonathan Schoop was back in the starting lineup for the first time since Saturday due to a sore left shoulder.	UP NEXT	Jake Odorizzi (5-2, 2.32 ERA) will try to extend his scoreless innings streak as he start's Wednesday's series finale. Trevor Cahill (2-3, 6.35) starts for Los Angeles. Odorizzi hasn't allowed a run since the sixth inning on April 22 at Houston, a stretch covering three starts. He surrendered just one hit in seven innings in his last start. Cahill beat Baltimore in his last start, giving up two runs on four hits in six innings.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Nicky Lopez rewarded the few thousand Kansas City Royals fans that stuck around through a game that stretched well past 3 hours with his first career hit, an RBI single late in their 11-5 rout of the Texas Rangers on Tuesday night.	But as he gazed up from first base, the Royals' top prospect found the ones that mattered most.	"I saw my family up there," he said, "and that's how I always imagined it."	Lopez, who was called up from Triple-A Omaha earlier in the day, was hardly the only Royals player to take some productive swings against the Rangers. Hunter Dozier drove in three runs, and Alex Gordon and Jorge Soler drove in two apiece, as the Royals scored nine times in the first two innings.	They quickly knocked out Shelby Miller (1-3), who was pulled with two outs in the second after he allowed eight runs on seven hits in two walks in another ugly post-Tommy John performance.	Danny Duffy (2-1) was only marginally better for Kansas City, using 107 pitches just to survive five innings. He allowed four runs, seven hits and a walk while striking out seven.	"You make a couple of bad pitches and all of a sudden they get four runs," Duffy said. "When my team gives me nine runs, it's a travesty to not go as long as I can."	Rangers shortstop Elvis Andrus left with tightness in his right hamstring after grounding out to end the seventh inning. He will be evaluated again Wednesday in another blow to a team that has lost five straight to fall a season-worst five games below .500.	"We'll obviously evaluate him tomorrow," Rangers manager Chris Woodward said, "but he seems pretty optimistic. He hasn't had a hamstring problem before. We'll see when he wakes up tomorrow how he feels."	The Royals pounced on Miller right from the start, sending seven to the plate in the first inning and jumping out to a 3-0 lead. But they cracked the game open in the second, when they sent 11 batters to the plate and drove in six runs against Miller and Rangers reliever Wei-Chieh Huang.	The stunning offensive outburst came after Kansas City managed six singles and no extra-base hits in a loss to the Phillies on Sunday. And it came after the arrival of Lopez, who got the start at second base and hit second behind Whit Merrifield in the lineup.	Lopez walked in the third before his first career hit made it a memorable night.	"Nicky had some great at-bats," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "I was glad to see Nicky get his first hit. That's under his belt and now he can move forward."	Joey Gallo had a pair of RBI for the Rangers, who tried to climb back into the game with a four-run third. But they stranded runners in four consecutive innings, repeatedly failing to get the crucial hit they needed to avoid a 1-6 start to their nine-game, 10-day road trip.	"They put some runs together. They put some big innings together," said Miller, whose ERA ballooned to 9.51 this season. "It's disappointing. I feel like I let my team down big-time."	NICKY'S NUMBER	The Royals originally made up No. 19 jerseys for Lopez, but he asked to wear No. 1 because it was the number his father wore in softball. New jerseys were made and arrived before first pitch.	ROSTER MOVES	The Royals made roster space for Lopez by sending right-hander Jake Newberry to Triple-A Omaha and designating first baseman Frank Schwindel for assignment. The Royals are hopeful Schwindel clears waivers and they can keep him in their organization.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers left-hander Cole Ragans, their first-round pick in the 2016 draft, will need a second Tommy John surgery after tearing his ulnar collateral ligament. The 21-year-old Ragans was close to pitching in a game for the first time since his last surgery when he began feeling discomfort about a week ago.	"It's obviously concerning," said Rangers general manager Jon Daniels, adding that surgery will be Wednesday. "This is the first Tommy John surgery we've had that's failed."	UP NEXT	The Royals hope Jorge Lopez (0-4, 6.07 ERA) can get on track Wednesday night after a blowout loss to the Astros. He goes against former Royals pitcher Mike Minor, who is 3-3 with a 2.68 ERA for Texas.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

PHOENIX --  Josh Bell is on the best hitting streak of his career, and the Pittsburgh Pirates are along for the ride.	Bell homered twice and Joe Musgrove allowed one hit through seven strong innings as the Pirates beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 6-2 Tuesday night.	Phoenix native Cole Tucker hit a two-run homer in the top of the eighth inning to cap off the victory. The 22-year-old rookie gleefully circled the bases in front of a large gathering of family and friends, and received a hearty welcome from his teammates in the dugout.	The Pirates snapped a nine-game losing streak to the Diamondbacks that dated to last season. Pittsburgh has won four of its last five.	Bell is on a career-best 14-game hitting streak, and is batting .421 over that span with seven doubles, six home runs and 21 runs batted in, including the four he picked up Tuesday.	"Just trying to sync up fastballs, get on a starter's fastball and understanding how guys are going to attack me and sell out to an approach and just go from there," Bell said. "It feels like I'm living in a dream a little bit."	Carson Kelly homered with two outs in the eighth and Adam Jones drove in David Peralta in the ninth to account for the Diamondbacks' runs.	Starling Marte scored the game's first run in the top of the third, hustling home from third base on Bell's fielder's choice.  Bell's fourth-inning homer to straightaway center off Arizona starter Luke Weaver came with two out and Gregory Polanco on base.	The only hit Musgrove (2-4) allowed was a fourth-inning single to Eduardo Escobar. He struck out five and walked two after allowing 13 total earned runs in his previous two starts.	"We've lost a lot of games to these guys consecutively, so it feels good to be the guy to come in and put a stop to that," Musgrove said. "The bounce-back outings are really important."	Bell had his second multi-home run game in 10 days. His second homer landed high up in the seats in right field and came on the first pitch of the eighth inning by Diamondbacks reliever Zack Godley.	Bell raised his season home run total to a team-best 12.	Tucker's second home run of the season was a two-run shot off Godley that just cleared the fence in right field. In between innings, the Pirates' position players stayed in the dugout briefly to let Tucker run out to shortstop by himself while the crowd behind the Pittsburgh dugout cheered.	Melky Cabrera had three hits for the Pirates, and is 28 for 63 with a.444 average in 15 career games at Chase Field. Marte added a pair of doubles.	"Just a fun night for the Buccos," manager Clint Hurdle said. "Bell is just mauling the ball."	Diamondbacks starter Luke Weaver (3-2) allowed three runs on seven hits in six innings. Arizona has lost four of five.	"We couldn't get anything going offensively," Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said. "Their starting pitcher was effective with early count pitches and kind of beating us to the spot."	TUCKER'S TIME	Tucker was still giddy in the visiting clubhouse after the game about his home run at the ballpark he grew up going to for Diamondbacks games.	"It was nuts, man. I couldn't even play it cool. I tried to, but the 12-year-old in me came out and I was just smiling and cheesing and laughing," Tucker said. "Literally audibly laughing. I couldn't have drawn it up any better."	Tucker homered in his major-league debut earlier this season, and his second homer came in his hometown. He was incredulous to hear that Diamondbacks legend and Hall-of-Famer Randy Johnson was at the game in the broadcast booth, and said that to hit a home run at Chase Field "means the world to me."	"I always dreamed about winning baseball games in this stadium," he said. "It was really fun to do that tonight."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: OF-IF Lonnie Chisenhall (calf strain) began a rehab assignment with Triple-A Indianapolis on Tuesday.	UP NEXT	Pirates: RHP Chris Archer (1-2, 4.33 earned run average) is expected to be reinstated from the 10-day injured list for his sixth start of the season Wednesday afternoon against Arizona. He's been dealing with thumb pain in his throwing hand.	Diamondbacks: RHP Zack Greinke (5-1, 3.16 ERA) takes the mound against the Pirates needing nine strikeouts to reach 2,500 in his career.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Vladimir Guerrero Jr. received some advice from his Hall of Fame father after hitting the first two home runs of his career. In return, the younger Guerrero plans on sending his father a few mementos from his historic night.	Guerrero homered twice to become the third-youngest player to hit his first two major league homers in the same game, and the Toronto Blue Jays beat the San Francisco Giants 7-3 Tuesday night.	Guerrero, who finished with three hits and four RBI, became the youngest in franchise history to go deep as the Blue Jays won the opener of a six-game trip after losing five of six on a homestand in which they totaled eight runs.	"He just said like he always told me, `Don't look for home runs. They're going to come," Guerrero said through a translator. "I'm going to give both balls and the bat to my dad. I'm going to keep using everything that I used today except the bat that I really want to give to my dad."	The touted 20-year-old Guerrero homered in the first inning against Giants opener Nick Vincent (0-2), his first in 14 big league games. His drive to straightaway center was measured at 111.3 mph and traveled an estimated 438 feet.	"He was talking about it during batting practice and he did it," Toronto manager Charlie Montoyo said. "We knew that was coming. He's that good. He could carry a team if he gets hot.  He can do stuff like that."	The Toronto slugger had a hard-hit single in the second then added an even more impressive blast in the sixth off Reyes Moronta, a three-run drive estimated at 451 feet.	The crowd at Oracle Park let out a collective gasp as the ball sailed over the wall in left-center. Winning pitcher Trent Thornton even got caught up watching.	"I was on second base and I'm just watching it go and go, and I'm like, `Wait, I gotta run," Thornton said. "He had a great game. That was just a lot of fun."	The only players younger than Guerrero to hit their first two home runs in the same game were Brian McCall in 1962 (19 years, 248 days) and Manny Machado in 2012 (20 years, 35 days).	Two-sport star Danny Ainge was the youngest Blue Jays player to homer, doing so on June 2, 1979 at 20 years, 77 days old. Guerrero is younger by 18 days.	Guerrero grounded out in his final at-bat. He entered the day batting .191 with one RBI.	"He wasn't pressing," Montoyo said. "He just plays and he has fun. He's an even-keeled kind of kid."	The Guerrero family already had long-ball history at Oracle Park -- the elder Guerrero won the 2007 Home Run Derby at the waterfront stadium.	"This kid is going to be a great player, he really is," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "You saw the bat speed, you saw how fast the ball comes off his bat. I've seen his dad hit balls like that."	Thornton (1-4) pitched three-hit ball into the sixth inning for his first major league win. The rookie right-hander struck out seven and overcame five walks. Thornton also singled twice to help the Blue Jays break out of their offensive funk.	Toronto got an overturned replay and added two runs in the first following Guerrero's first home run.	Freddy Galvis hit an RBI double that fell just over the glove of charging right fielder Steven Duggar but was ruled foul by first base umpire Adrian Johnson. After Montoyo asked for a replay, a brief review was held and the call was overturned. Bill McKinney then doubled in Galvis.	Pablo Sandoval homered for San Francisco.	The Giants used an opener for the first time. Vincent allowed three runs and four hits in one inning in his second career start.	LATE MOTHER'S DAY GIFT	Thornton flew his parents in from North Carolina for the game as a belated Mother's Day present and got his first win and first two hits since college.	"I was lucky I got all fastballs today," Thornton said. "I just kind of closed my eyes and swung and got lucky two times."	TRAINERS ROOM	Giants: C Buster Posey caught Drew Pomeranz's bullpen session and could be activated off the concussion list as early as Friday. Posey's next step will be running the bases Wednesday. ... Pomeranz threw 60 pitches in his bullpen.	UP NEXT	Edwin Jackson will make history when he pitches for his 14th major league team in his Toronto debut Wednesday. A 35-year-old right-hander, Jackson was acquired by the Blue Jays from Oakland on Saturday for $30,000. He made three minor league starts for the Athletics, two at Triple-A and one at Class A. RHP Shaun Anderson makes his major league debut for San Francisco.	--	More AP MLB:https://apnews.com/MLBandhttps://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

LOS ANGELES --  In a story May 15 about a game between the San Diego Padres and Los Angeles Dodgers, The Associated Press reported erroneously that Alex Verdugo drove in Corey Seager with a single in the fourth inning. Chris Taylor singled to drive in Seager.	A corrected version of the story is below:	Bellinger, Pederson lead Dodgers to 6-3 victory over Padres	Joc Pederson and Cody Bellinger hit two-run homers, Clayton Kershaw threw seven solid innings and the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the San Diego Padres 6-3 in the opener of a two-game series	By JOE REEDY	AP Sports Writer	LOS ANGELES --  Dodgers sluggers Joc Pederson and Cody Bellinger showed again why they are top home run duo in the National League.	Pederson and Bellinger hit two-run shots and Clayton Kershaw threw seven solid innings in Los Angeles' 6-3 victory over the San Diego Padres on Tuesday night in the opener of a two-game series.	Pederson and Bellinger homered in the third inning against starter Chris Paddack (3-2) and helped the Dodgers get their third win in four meetings against their NL West rivals. The duo has combined for 28 home runs, which is one behind Houston's George Springer and Alex Bregman for the most by teammates in the majors.	This was the fifth game where Pederson and Bellinger have both homered.	"They are both in a good place right now," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. "Joc has been rewarded in his approach with some home runs the past couple games. Cody has done a good job lately of not chasing the long ball and letting it happen."	Bellinger, who also drove in three runs, leads the majors with a .409 batting average and got his 19th multihit game this season. The home run was his first since April 28.	Kershaw (3-0) allowed three runs and five hits. The left-hander struck out five as he recorded his third victory in his last four starts. Kenley Jansen worked the ninth for his 13th save.	"Their two guys in the middle did damage but other than that it was all right," Kershaw said. "You're not always going to have your best stuff, but the beauty of being on such a great team is we are going to score runs."	Manny Machado had three hits -- including a 441-foot, two-run shot in the fourth -- in his first game back at Dodger Stadium since signing with San Diego during the offseason. Machado was acquired by the Dodgers from Baltimore on July 19 last season and was one of the key players in them getting to the World Series for the second straight year.	Franmil Reyes homered and had two hits for San Diego, which has dropped three of its last four. Paddack surrendered a season-high six runs, three earned, on five hits with three strikeouts.	"I could've done a better job with my fastball command early. My changeup wasn't my best tonight. I could have attacked it a little different," Paddack said.	The Padres scored two batters into the game when Reyes hit a solo shot off Kershaw to center, his second home run in seven at-bats against Kershaw.	Austin Barnes got on base to lead off the Los Angeles third when Machado's throw took Eric Hosmer off the bag. Two batters later, Pederson drove Paddack's fastball over the wall in center for LA's first hit and a 2-1 lead. The Dodgers added to their lead later in the inning when Bellinger hit a two-run homer for his 15th of the season.	Machado's shot drew the Padres within 4-3 before the Dodgers added a run each in the fourth and fifth innings. Corey Seager led off the fourth with a double and came home on Chris Taylor's single. Max Muncy made it a three-run lead an inning later when he scored on Bellinger's groundout.	MILESTONE BLAST	Pederson's home run was the 100th of his career. He is the 28th player in Dodgers' history to accomplish that feat. Half of Pederson's 26 hits this season are homers.	"I hope there's more to my offense than power but it seems like everything else I hit is an out," said Pederson, who leads the majors in home runs against righties with 13.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: RHP Trey Wingenter (shoulder strain) threw a side session Tuesday and could come off the inactive list the next day or two. Wingenter was eligible to come off the IL on Tuesday.	Dodgers: LHP Caleb Ferguson (oblique) is expected to be activated off the IL on Friday after he made a couple of rehab appearances last week.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: Conclude a nine-game homestand and send RHP Kenta Maeda (4-2, 4.03) to the mound. Maeda pitched six scoreless innings against the Nationals last Friday but allowed four runs on three hits in six innings against the Padres on May 5.	Padres: LHP Matt Strahm (1-2, 3.00) is fourth in the National League in road ERA (2.05). He has 32 strikeouts against three walks in his last six outings dating back to April 7.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

SEATTLE --  Seattle Mariners manager Scott Servais sat pitcher Roenis Elias down at the beginning of the season and delivered a powerful message: You belong here.	The long reliever showed again Tuesday why Servais had such confidence in him, pitching the Mariners out of a bases-loaded jam in the seventh inning with a strikeout to preserve Mike Leake's win, then ending the game with another strikeout seven outs later in a 4-3 victory over the Oakland Athletics.	"We sat down with him early and tried to simplify some things with him," Servais said. "And we flat out told him, `Hey, you're on the team, just go pitch.' It's amazing when guys hear that, because he's never had that happen before. He's taken it and has got a lot of confidence and has continued to grow."	Elias showed how much on Tuesday. He recorded his 300th career strikeout and earned his fifth save -- the first save of at least 2 1/3 innings in a one-run game by a Mariners pitcher since Bob Wells did it in 1997. The performance helped Leake (3-4) earn the win and sent the A's to their third straight loss and fourth in their last six games.	"That's when he's at his best, when you can run him out there and let him face nine, 10 hitters," Servais said. "He really saved the game for us  -- literally."	The Mariners built a home run-powered 4-2 lead through six innings on solo homers by Daniel Vogelbach and Tim Beckham in the second inning and a two-run, tie-breaking homer in the fifth inning by Mitch Haniger. The outfielder's 11th home run wiped out a two-run throwing error by Beckham in the top of the inning that allowed the A's to tie the game 2-2.	Leake was extremely efficient, allowing five hits while striking out six with one walk. But he gave up a weak one-out double to Stephen Piscotty that dropped in front of right fielder Jay Bruce in the seventh, then an RBI single to Robbie Grossman to put the game in jeopardy. Reliever Corey Gearin gave up a single, then walked a batter on four straight pitches to load the bases before Elias was called to the mound.	He struck out pinch-hitter Chad Pinder on three pitches to end the threat and had no intention of sitting down after that.	"I felt that once I came in to get that out in the seventh inning, I knew the rest of the game would be up to me," Elias said.	A's starter Brett Anderson (4-3) gave up just six hits and struck out five in six innings. But the Mariners hit him hard, sending several balls to the warning track in addition to their three homers. Seattle improved to 15-7 when hitting at least two home runs and has scored more than half its runs (125 of 240) on its league-best 82 homers.	In the end, though, it wasn't the home runs that bothered Anderson. It was the walk he issued to ninth hitter J.P. Crawford -- one batter before Haniger put the game away.	"The biggest thing is the one walk to Crawford," he said. "Even if I give up a solo homer to Haniger there I feel like the offense has a good chance to make up the one run, and ultimately they did, but there was a guy on base. That's the most frustrating part is the one walk came back to haunt me in the end."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners 3B Kyle Seager will play third base Wednesday for the first time since hand surgery in a rehab assignment for Triple-A Tacoma in Las Vegas. Seager was 1 of 4 as the designated hitter in his first appearance for the club on Tuesday. He's eligible to return from the injured list on May 25. . Servais expects 2B Dee Gordon to return to the starting lineup on Thursday against Minnesota. Gordon, hit by a pitch on the right hand May 9 against the Yankees, was available to pinch hit in Tuesday's game. . Utility player Dylan Moore fielded the ball and was expected to take batting practice Tuesday for the first time since a wrist contusion caused by a pitch put him on the injured list May 10. He's eligible to return May 20.	UP NEXT	Athletics: Oakland takes Wednesday off before sending RHP Chris Bassitt (1-1, 2.55) to the mound against Detroit. The A's have scored two or fewer runs in three of Bassitt's four starts this season.	Mariners: Seattle takes Wednesday off before sending RHP Erik Swanson (1-4, 6.35) to the mound against Minnesota. Swanson was brought in to replace injured pitcher Wade LeBlanc and will likely stay in the rotation now that Felix Hernandez is expected to miss four to six weeks with a right lat strain.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

MINNEAPOLIS --  This strong start by the first-place Minnesota Twins has been fueled by an ample supply of power.	Byron Buxton and Jason Castro each hit two-run homers, just the cushion that was needed to withstand a late surge by the Los Angeles Angels.	"Just put good swings on the ball," Buxton said, "and the ball will do what it does."	Twins reliever Mike Morin hit former teammate Mike Trout with a bases-loaded pitch that forced in a run in the ninth inning before retiring Shohei Ohtani to end the game on a groundout and preserve an 8-7 victory over the Angels on Wednesday.	"I thought we were going to sneak away with it," Angels starter Trevor Cahill said, "but give the Twins credit. They stopped us at the end."	Jonathan Lucroy had an RBI double and David Fletcher drove in a run with a single against Trevor Hildenberger in the three-run ninth, before the AL Central leaders turned to Morin for the final two outs and his first save this season. Morin gave up two of the season-high 18 hits by the Angels and plunked Trout on the shoulder.	Ehire Adrianza added a two-run double for the Twins, who took the three-game set from the Angels and improved their series record this season to 8-4-2. They've won 10 of their last 15 games, and they're 24-6 when scoring four or more runs. The Twins have 76 home runs in 42 games, the third-most in the majors.	"We just have a knack for hitting them, and it's good to have," Twins starter Jake Odorizzi said. "You're never out of a game and can get a lead. We needed every bit of that lead. It's going to be a good year watching these guys keep progressing through these at bats."	Odorizzi (6-2) had his scoreless streak stopped at 22 innings, the fifth-longest in team history, when Tommy La Stella took him deep in the third for his team-leading 11th homer. Lucroy tacked on a two-run shot in the sixth, which Odorizzi did not finish for the first time in four starts. He gave up nine hits and three runs in 5 1/3 innings, but this Twins lineup that's suddenly stacked with sluggers produced enough support. The Twins began the day with an .823 OPS, second-best in the majors.	"You're going to have to win games ugly and clean," Odorizzi said. "Whatever they are, we're going to have to win them one way or another to make the postseason. Today it got interesting, and we still won."	Cahill (2-4) bore the brunt of that, allowing six hits and six runs in 4 1/3 innings. He failed to finish the fifth for the fifth time in his last six turns, and the major league leader in home runs allowed has now been taken deep 14 times after the drive to left-center by Buxton in the fifth .	Castro homered off Luke Bard , his sixth of the season and the most uplifting hit of the afternoon for the Twins given the injury to fellow catcher Mitch Garver . The Twins lead the major leagues with 17 home runs and 40 RBI from the catching position.	The Angels went 3 for 17 with runners in scoring position, leaving 14 men on base. Blake Parker, their closer last season, struck out Ohtani with two runners on to finish the eighth. Trevor May, who has stranded all 10 runners he's inherited this season, relieved Odorizzi and ended the sixth with a fly out by La Stella to leave two on.	THE ANGELS' GREATEST HITS	La Stella went 4 for 5, his 10th multi-hit game of the season, and is batting .367 over his last 20 games. Lucroy drove in three runs, raising his career average against the Twins to .343 with 31 RBI in 140 at-bats. Brian Goodwin tied his career best with four hits.	STRUGGLING SIDEARMER	Hildenberger, who has allowed 13 runs in 6 1/3 innings over his last eight games, was sent to Triple-A Rochester after the game. The right-hander started the season with 11 scoreless appearances, spanning 7 2/3 innings.	MULTI-PURPOSE	Ohtani and his two-way skills have some company in the clubhouse. The Angels promoted first baseman Jared Walsh from Triple-A Salt Lake, filling the roster spot vacated by Justin Bour's demotion, and Walsh marked his major league debut with three singles. Walsh, who like Ohtani is a pitcher and a hitter, was a 39th-round draft pick in 2015. He batted .302 with 10 homers and 26 RBI in 37 games for Salt Lake and allowed two runs in five innings as a reliever.	"Pretty much everything I hoped it would be," Walsh said of his debut.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: LF Justin Upton, who has yet to play this season because of a turf toe injury on his left foot, has begun throwing and swinging in the batting cage. He has yet to be cleared for running on the ground, only on a special anti-gravity treadmill, Ausmus said.	Twins: DH Nelson Cruz was held out for the third straight game because of a sore left wrist, but manager Rocco Baldelli said he was available to play if needed.	UP NEXT	Angels: After an off day, the Angels return home for a three-game series against Kansas City. RHP Matt Harvey (1-3, 6.59 ERA) starts on Friday night, opposite Royals RHP Brad Keller (2-4, 4.47 ERA).	Twins: RHP Michael Pineda (2-3, 5.85 ERA) takes his turn on Thursday night in Seattle when the Twins start a four-game series against his original team the Mariners, who send RHP Erik Swanson (1-4, 6.35 ERA) to the mound.	---	More AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.

NEW YORK --  Playing a single-admission doubleheader after consecutive rainouts, the Yankees filled the seats with souvenirs before most fans had arrived.	Gleyber Torres hit two of New York's four home runs, and the Yankees beat the Baltimore Orioles 5-3 Wednesday in the first game of a doubleheader.	Gary Sanchez and Cameron Maybin also homered for the Yankees, who rank near the middle of the pack power-wise this season after slugging a record 266 homers last year. New York has won 19 of 26 games to move a season-high nine games over .500 at 25-16 despite currently having 13 players on the injured list.	"We got two days in a row off," Torres said. "I think everyone was rested."	The ballpark was mostly empty for the 3:05 p.m. start time, an odd atmosphere for a Yankees game at home or on the road.	"It felt a little off at first to me," Yankees manager Aaron Boone said.	By the time most fans were filing in, Orioles starter David Hess (1-5) had allowed a career-high four homers. He completed six innings on 89 pitches, getting charged with five runs (four earned) with six hits and six strikeouts.	Sanchez hit his 12th homer, best among big league catchers. Torres had his second multihomer game this season and fourth of his career.	The Orioles have allowed 88 homers allowed through 41 games, by far the most in the majors. That puts them on pace to give up 348 for the season, which would smash the record of 258 by the 2016 Cincinnati Reds.	"I don't think it goes over too well," manager Brandon Hyde said. "It's always tough. We've given up a ton this year and it's just something that we're going to have to really improve on to stay in games. You just can't give up four home runs against the New York Yankees and expect to win the game."	Yankees left-hander J.A. Happ (3-3) was pulled after 5 1/3 innings and 64 pitches. He allowed three runs and five hits, including solo homers to Trey Mancini and Renato Nunez. Happ wasn't thrilled when Boone came for the ball.	"I just wanted to make sure he remembered we had a doubleheader," Happ said. "He did. He's got his reasons."	Following scoreless relief from Adam Ottavino, Tommy Kahnle and Zack Britton, Aroldis Chapman pitched the ninth for his 10th save in 11 chances. None of those relievers threw more than 15 pitches, and Boone said some would be available in the late game.	New York entered the game with 57 homers, tied with three teams for 10th in the majors. This was the Yankees' fourth game with at least four homers this season, and three have come against Baltimore, including a seven-homer, 15-3 win on April 7.	"We just need to not do that period," catcher Austin Wynns said. "It's too many home runs. It's embarrassing. We have to put an end to that."	Wynns doubled in a run and had two hits for Baltimore. He was a teammate of injured Yankees star Aaron Judge at Fresno State.	Game 1 wrapped in a tidy 2 hours, 12 minutes.	NEEDED REST	Torres said his right elbow is still in "a lot of pain" when he throws after getting hit by a pitch Friday, but getting two days off with the rainouts helped.	"If I can play with pain, I do," he said.	FRESH REINFORCEMENTS	A day after being acquired by New York from Oakland, veteran slugger Kendrys Morales arrived in the Bronx during Game 1 and was put in the Game 2 lineup as designated hitter.	Center fielder Aaron Hicks was also in the nightcap lineup, his first appearance since straining his back in spring training.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: RHP Evan Phillips was brought up as the team's 26th man.	Yankees: 3B Miguel Andujar has not decided yet whether he'll have surgery to repair a small labrum tear in his right shoulder. ... LHP James Paxton (left knee inflammation) felt good a day after throwing a bullpen session. He'll throw off a mound again Friday. ... OF Giancarlo Stanton (left shoulder strain) and SS Didi Gregorius (Tommy John surgery) took 11 plate appearances each in extended spring training. Gregorius said he expects to play shortstop in extended spring games beginning Monday.	UP NEXT	In the second game, Yankees RHP Domingo German (7-1) tried to extend his major league wins lead against Baltimore RHP Andrew Cashner (4-1).	---	Follow Jake Seiner: https://twitter.com/Jake-Seiner	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

PHOENIX --  Zack Greinke was cruising along when he felt something wrong. Taking no chances, the Arizona Diamondbacks ace called it a day.	Greinke pitched shutout ball into the eighth inning before exiting with abdominal tightness and the Diamondbacks routed Chris Archer and the Pittsburgh Pirates 11-1.	Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said Greinke would get an MRI on Friday. Arizona is off Thursday.	"It's not too bad," Greinke said. "Just didn't seem like a good idea to try to push it."	Greinke said the current situation seems less serious than the left oblique injury that cost him six weeks in 2016, though he thought about that at first.	"I just knew something was wrong and didn't want to take the chance of hurting it more," he said. "At first I thought it was an oblique thing, but it seems to be in a different spot."	Greinke (6-1) allowed four hits in 7 2/3 innings, then walked off the mound with a trainer with a 2-2 count on Pirates reliever Chris Stratton. Greinke said he felt his injury during that at-bat.	"I'm always optimistic about things," Lovullo said, admitting that if not for the injury he considered allowing Greinke to go after a complete game.	Greinke struck out five, walked none and kept up his recent run of success -- he has a 1.09 ERA in his last six starts, allowing five earned runs in 41 1/3 innings. He also raised his scoreless innings streak against the Pirates to 21 1/3 innings.	"This is the most consistent that I've seen him. It's angle of the fastball. It's throwing fastballs to both sides of the plate, and he's got three secondary pitches that he can throw at any time," Lovullo said. "We get spoiled by him. We know that he's extremely locked in right now."	Blake Swihart hit a two-run, inside-the-park home run in the eighth, and Eduardo Escobar and Adam Jones also homered for the Diamondbacks, who went 6-1 against the Pirates this season. Jarrod Dyson had two hits, scored three runs and stole two bases.	Melky Cabrera drove in the Pirates' run with a two-out single in the ninth.	Pirates pitcher Chris Archer's first start since April 26, after which he went on the 10-day injured list with right thumb pain, didn't go well. He walked the bases loaded in the first inning, and all three runners scored.	Archer (1-3) lasted just 3 2/3 innings, allowing six earned runs on four hits with four walks and a wild pitch.	Dyson came home on Ketel Marte's soft single, Escobar scored on an error by third baseman Colin Moran and Nick Ahmed added a sacrifice fly to put Arizona ahead 3-0.	Archer rallied to strike out the side in the second inning, but the Diamondbacks plated four runs in the fourth, all with two outs.	"Poor. Very, very poor. I just didn't have good command at all," Archer said. "I don't really know what to say other than that.	"They exploited my lack of control," Archer added, saying his thumb did not affect him.	After Dyson's single, Escobar hit his ninth homer of the season. Jones' ninth homer curled inside the left-field foul pole and into the Diamondbacks bullpen in the fifth off Stratton.	"Home runs happen, but when you can score runs on some base hits, that's when you know you're offense is clicking," Jones said.	Escobar doubled in Dyson for his third RBI of the game in the eighth. Swihart hit a long fly and when the ball caromed off the angled wall in right-center and eluded two outfielders, he scored standing up for his second career inside-the-park homer.	Josh Bell got two hits for the Pirates, extending his career-high hitting streak to 15 games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: Archer's return from injury led to the Pirates optioning RHP Clay Holmes to Triple-A Indianapolis. ...  OF Corey Dickerson (shoulder) is on track to throw long toss as soon as this weekend. ... RHP Keone Kela (shoulder) could throw off a mound in the next few days.	Diamondbacks: OF David Peralta left the game after five innings with tightness on the right side of his upper back, replaced by Swihart in left field. Lovullo said he hopes some training room therapy will take care of Peralta's issue. ... RHP Taijuan Walker (elbow surgery) was scheduled to pitch four innings in an extended spring training game Wednesday at the team's facility in nearby Scottsdale. But he threw just 17 pitches due to right shoulder soreness and was removed as a precaution, then had an MRI later Wednesday.	UP NEXT	Pirates: Pittsburgh begins a four-game series at San Diego on Thursday, with RHP Trevor Williams (2-1, 3.40 ERA) scheduled to start the opener. He's pitched at least six innings in each of his eight starts this season.	Diamondbacks: RHP Merrill Kelly (3-4, 4.70 ERA) gets the ball at home on Friday against the San Francisco Giants, the opener of a three-game series. It'll be his first career start against the Giants.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Edwin Jackson thinks his new place in baseball history has as much to do with his reputation as it does his repertoire.	Nearly 16 years after he made his big league debut, both are still holding up.	Jackson became the first player in major league history to play for 14 teams when he made his Toronto Blue Jays debut and pitched five innings without a decision in a 4-3 loss to the San Francisco Giants on Wednesday.	"It says I have a lot of perseverance," Jackson said. "I'm not one to give in. I feel like out of those 14 teams, some of those teams have had situations that would probably make people want to go home and quit and cry. For me, the tougher it gets, the harder I work and the harder I come to prove myself that I can come get outs in the major leagues."	The 35-year-old right-hander allowed three runs (two earned) and six hits in five innings. He struck out two, walked one, hit a batter and left after 77 pitches with the score 3-3.	Toronto acquired Jackson from Oakland on Saturday for $30,000. He began his tenure with his new team by throwing an 88 mph cutter that Joe Panik took for a called strike.	"We were thinking about 80 to 90, and he gave us 77," Toronto manager Charlie Montoyo said. "He kept us in the game. He did a great job. He's going to give you all he's got every time he takes the mound, like he did today."	Jackson had been tied with Octavio Dotel for the most MLB teams. Jackson agreed last month to a minor league contract with the A's and was 1-0 with a 6.75 ERA in three minor league starts.	In addition to the Blue Jays and Athletics, Jackson has played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Tampa Bay Rays, Detroit Tigers, Arizona Diamondbacks, Chicago White Sox, St. Louis Cardinals, Washington Nationals, Chicago Cubs, Atlanta Braves, Miami Marlins, San Diego Padres and Baltimore Orioles. He won a World Series title with the Cardinals in 2011.	"If I was one of those guys that was a nuisance to the clubhouse, then it wouldn't feel as great," Jackson said. "But knowing that the name that I've left behind for myself, on the field stuff, off the field, there's not too many people that have a lot of bad things to say about me. In that regard, it feels great. The personality gives me a chance to have an opportunity to play with a team. Now I have to go get it done."	Brandon Crawford hit a tiebreaking home run in the sixth off Ryan Tepera (0-2) after going 0-for-2 against Jackson.	"He's always been a tough at-bat for me," Crawford said. "Threw me a nasty cutter in my second at-bat and has always mixed speeds with his slider and changeup."	Toronto has four starting pitchers on the injured list, including right-handers Clay Buchholz (shoulder) and Matt Shoemaker (out for the season after knee surgery) and left-handers Ryan Borucki (elbow) and Clayton Richard (right knee).	Jackson, who made his 306th big league start, is 104-123 in 17 big league seasons.	He gets paid at the rate of a $2 million salary while in the majors and can earn $500,000 in performance bonuses based on starts: $150,000 each for 15 and 18 and $200,000 for 20.	Mark Melancon (1-0) pitched out of a first-and-third, no-outs jam in the sixth for the win. Will Smith struck out the side in the ninth to remain perfect in 11 save chances.	Aramis Garcia also homered for San Francisco.	Toronto leadoff hitter Brandon Drury singled and scored three runs. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. walked and had an RBI groundout in four plate appearances, one day after the 20-year-old became the third-youngest player to hit his first two major league home runs in the same game.	Freddy Galvis hit an RBI double in the first, but Jackson gave up a run-scoring double to Pablo Sandoval in the bottom half. Garcia hit a two-run homer in the second after right fielder Billy McKinney dropped Kevin Pillar's short fly ball for an error.	EFFECTIVE DEBUT	Giants starter Shaun Anderson also gave up three runs (two earned) in five innings but allowed just two hits. He threw a run-scoring wild pitch in the third and allowed Guerrero's tying grounder in the fifth.	"We didn't play our best defense, and they got a couple of cheap runs, but overall I thought he did a nice job," manager Bruce Bochy said. "Couldn't get a hit to blow it open, but he did his job."	MOVES	Toronto LHP Thomas Pannone was optioned to Triple-A Buffalo after going 1-3 with a 6.85 ERA in 14 games for the Blue Jays. RHP David Phelps and Shoemaker were transferred to the 60-day IL. Toronto also claimed RHP Jimmy Cordero off of waivers from Washington and optioned him to Buffalo. Cordero has not pitched in the majors this season. The 27-year-old was 1-2 with a 5.68 ERA in 22 games with the Nationals in 2018.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Giants: 1B Brandon Belt was rested because of a sore right knee. With an off day Thursday, the hope is that the inflammation in Belt's knee will go down. ... RHP Johnny Cueto (Tommy John surgery) is expected to throw a 40-pitch bullpen on Saturday in Arizona.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays: RHP Marcus Stroman (1-6, 3.12 ERA) makes his second straight start against the White Sox when Toronto begins a four-game series on Thursday in Chicago. Stroman allowed three runs in 6 1/3 innings and took the loss Saturday.	Giants: RHP Jeff Samardzija (2-1, 3.51) pitches against Arizona on Friday for the first time since 2017. Samardzija has struggled this season and has made it past five innings twice in eight starts.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

NEW YORK --  Gleyber Day turned into something of a nightmare for the Baltimore Orioles on Wednesday.	Gleyber Torres hit three home runs during a doubleheader sweep, including a solo shot in the nightcap, and Domingo German became the majors' first eight-game winner in the New York Yankees' 3-1 victory over Baltimore.	Playing a twinbill after rainouts Monday and Tuesday, Torres hit two of New York's four homers during a 5-3 win in the opener. The 2018 All-Star has eight homers this season, and six have come against the Orioles.	"We got two days in a row off," Torres said. "I think everyone was rested."	The Yankees announced during the second game that third baseman Miguel Andujar, last year's runner-up for AL Rookie of the Year, will have season-ending surgery to repair a small labrum tear in his right shoulder Monday.	"Hurt for him a little bit," manager Aaron Boone said. "But know this is also just the beginning of the road back."	New York has won 20 of 27 games to move a season-high 10 games over .500 at 26-16 despite currently having 13 players on the injured list.	Aroldis Chapman closed out both games, giving him 11 saves in 12 chances. Zack Britton also pitched a scoreless inning in each game.	German (8-1) matched a career high with seven innings, allowing a run and striking out eight. He threw first-pitch strikes to 21 of his 27 batters and has a 2.41 ERA in a breakout season.	The 26-year-old right-hander loaded the bases with two outs in the seventh but escaped on Joey Rickard's groundout to preserve a one-run lead.	"That whole inning, that's a big experience for me," German said through a translator. "Very happy that (manager Aaron Boone) allowed me to pitch through that inning."	German is the first Yankee since Tommy John in 1979 to win eight of his first nine appearances to start a season, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.	"This doesn't mean I take my foot off the pedal," German said.	Andrew Cashner (4-2) pitched six innings of two-run ball, striking out seven. He was visited by a trainer in the third after DJ LeMahieu's comebacker struck him in the left thumb. He stayed in, and Luke Voit drilled his next pitch off the wall in left-center for an RBI double.	"I thought it was some of the best stuff he's had all year," manager Brandon Hyde said. "From the first inning he was 95, 96 with a really good breaking ball."	Voit's hit ended his 0-for-18 skid. He added two more hits, including an RBI single in the eighth.	The 22-year-old Torres joined Joe DiMaggio as the only Yankees under 23 years old with three homers in a day. DiMaggio had two three-homer days at 22 or younger -- during a doubleheader in 1936 and a three-homer game in 1937, according to STATS.	ON GAME 1	Playing a single-admission doubleheader after consecutive rainouts, the Yankees filled the seats with souvenirs before most fans had arrived for the first game- the result of an odd 3:05 p.m. start time.	Gary Sanchez and Cameron Maybin also went deep, and Orioles starter David Hess (1-5) set a career high with four homers allowed.	The Orioles have allowed 89 homers through 42 games, by far the most in the majors. That puts them on pace to give up 343 for the season, which would smash the record of 258 by the 2016 Cincinnati Reds.	"It's too many home runs," catcher Austin Wynns said. "It's embarrassing. We have to put an end to that."	Yankees left-hander J.A. Happ (3-3) was pulled after 5 1/3 innings and 64 pitches. He allowed three runs and five hits, including solo homers to Trey Mancini and Renato Nunez.	The opening game wrapped in a tidy 2 hours, 12 minutes.	FRESH REINFORCEMENTS	A day after being acquired by New York from Oakland, veteran slugger Kendrys Morales arrived in the Bronx during Game 1 and was put in the Game 2 lineup as designated hitter. Morales had an infield single in the eighth and walked twice.	Center fielder Aaron Hicks was also in the nightcap lineup, his first appearance since straining his back in spring training. Hicks was 0 for 4 with three strikeouts, admitting he was nervous for his first at-bat of the season.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: RHP Evan Phillips was brought up as the team's 26th man.	Yankees: LHP James Paxton (left knee inflammation) felt good a day after throwing a bullpen session. He'll throw off a mound again Friday. ... OF Giancarlo Stanton (left shoulder strain) and SS Didi Gregorius (Tommy John surgery) took 11 plate appearances each in extended spring training. Gregorius said he expects to play shortstop in extended spring games beginning Monday. ... RHP Joe Harvey was optioned to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.	UP NEXT	Orioles: RHP Dan Straily (1-3, 8.23) pitches the opener of a four-game set at Cleveland. RHP Trevor Bauer (4-2, 3.02) is up for the Indians.	Yankees: Open a three-game series against Tampa Bay on Friday with LHP CC Sabathia (2-1, 3.26) set to pitch. Sabathia has had heated exchanges with the Rays the last two times he faced them, upset over plunked New York hitters. Tampa Bay hadn't announced a starter.	---	Follow Jake Seiner: https://twitter.com/Jake-Seiner	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

CINCINNATI --  Yasiel Puig got a chance to redeem his rough night and came through with his biggest moment yet in Cincinnati.	The struggling outfielder hit an RBI single with the bases loaded in the 10th inning Wednesday night, rallying the Reds to a 6-5 victory over the Chicago Cubs. He tossed his bat away in celebration and got soaked with ice water by teammates.	"I finally made contact," Puig said. "That was amazing."	Puig's had a mostly disappointing debut with the Reds, who got him in an offseason trade with the Dodgers. He was 0 for 4 with three strikeouts when he came to bat in the 10th against Brad Brach (3-1). The bases were loaded and the Cubs used five infielders, hoping for a groundball.	Instead, Puig drove the ball to center -- it smacked off the base of the wall -- and flipped his bat away in celebration. Puig is batting only .212.	"He brings a lot of energy," manager David Bell said. "He absolutely wanted to be up there in that spot. He saw it as an opportunity. He wasn't defensive."	Amir Garrett (3-1) escaped a two-on threat in the 10th inning.	The Cubs' stingy bullpen let a solid start by Yu Darvish go to waste. Darvish fanned 11 and Addison Russell hit a two-run homer -- his first since returning from a 40-game suspension for domestic violence -- to help the Cubs to a 5-3 lead.	Eugenio Suarez's homer off Carl Edwards Jr. tied it in the eighth, only the fourth time the Cubs have blown such a late lead.	The Cubs were encouraged by Darvish's best performance of the season. He allowed five hits and a pair of runs in 5 1/3 innings at the ballpark where his 2018 season ended.	The right-hander made only eight starts in his first year with the Cubs. He got a 6-1 win at Great American Ball Park on May 20 and missed the rest of the season with triceps and elbow problems, leading to surgery on Sept. 12.	He has struggled with his control this season. Back in Cincinnati, Darvish had his first 10-strikeout game since 2017. He didn't walk a batter while throwing 102 pitches and using a nasty slider.	"Obviously I'm trying to find my way," Darvish said. "I'm trying a lot of things."	The Cubs knew Darvish would need some time to get back in form after having most of 2018 wiped out.	"In each start, you're seeing something different that you can take away as a positive," catcher Taylor Davis said. "Everything is starting to pinwheel into putting everything together."	Russell and Albert Almora Jr. connected off Sonny Gray, who came to the Reds in an offseason trade with the Yankees and has yet to win in nine starts for the team he rooted for as a youth. Kyle Schwarber also homered .	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: 1B Anthony Rizzo hit in the batting cage but was out of the lineup for the third straight game with a stiff back. Manager Joe Maddon said he'd likely be out of the lineup again Thursday, but return for a weekend series in Washington.	Reds: Left-hander Alex Wood could start throwing next week. He hurt his back during spring training and has had several setbacks during rehabilitation, preventing him from pitching.	10K	The last time Darvish fanned 10 batters was Aug. 10, 2017, at Arizona with the Dodgers. It was the 35th 10-strikeout game of his career.	STREAKING	Kris Bryant singled in the 10th, extending his streak to 24 consecutive games reaching safely. It's the longest active streak in the majors and the longest by a Cub since Ben Zobrist reached in 25 straight games in 2017. Javier Baez singled in the 10th, extending his career-best hitting streak to 13 games.	SOLID CONTACT	Darvish singled for his first hit of the season and only the sixth of his career. In the first two games of the series, Cubs starters have four hits. Kyle Hendricks had a career-high three hits in a 3-1 win on Tuesday.	UP NEXT	Cubs: Jose Quintana (4-2) is 4-1 with a 2.29 ERA in his last six starts. The left-hander is 1-1 with a 3.00 ERA in two career starts at Great American Ball Park.	Reds: Luis Castillo (4-1) went 2-1 in five starts against the Cubs last season with a 4.74 ERA.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

WASHINGTON --  For the second time in a week, Patrick Corbin righted the ship for the Washington Nationals.	Corbin struck out 11 in eight strong innings and Victor Robles homered to help the Nationals top the New York Mets 5-1 on Wednesday night.	Corbin (4-1) allowed one run and four hits to win his second consecutive start. Signed to a $140 million contract as a free agent in the offseason, the left-hander also beat the Los Angeles Dodgers last Thursday and has given up one run over his past 15 innings.	"You always want to be that guy to take the ball and go out there and compete," Corbin said. "Just trying to put up as many zeros as I can and keep us in the game. They did a great job putting up five runs today."	Corbin, facing the Mets for the third time this season following two no-decisions, retired 15 of 16 batters from the third into the eighth inning, often making New York hitters flail at sliders that ended up out of the strike zone.	"He's able to throw that slider for strike-to-ball, and it's hard to lay off it," Mets manager Mickey Calloway said. "It's one of the best pitches in the major leagues. He had good fastball command as well. He was kind of dotting that where he wanted to."	The Nationals are 6-3 in games Corbin has started. His past two wins have ended four- and two-game skids, respectively.	Anthony Rendon had three hits for Washington (17-25), which had lost seven of 10. He had two doubles and a single, scored twice and drove in a run.	Wilmer Font (1-1) didn't make it through the third in his second start for New York after being acquired from Tampa Bay on May 6. He gave up five runs and six hits -- including a homer and three long doubles -- in 2 1/3 innings.	Font was 1-0 with the Rays this season.	J.D. Davis had an RBI double for the Mets, who had won three straight.	Washington scored three runs in the first and two more in the third, with Font departing after Howie Kendrick's RBI double made it 5-1.	"Tonight was a really big night for us, especially with a lot of the young guys making the strides that they did, having good at-bats," Kendrick said.	CANO'S WOES	Mets second baseman Robinson Cano (0 for 4 with three strikeouts) is hitting .191 (9 for 47) in May with no homers and one RBI.	CORDERO CLAIMED	Right-hander Jimmy Cordero, designated for assignment by the Nationals last week, was claimed off waivers by Toronto. He had been pitching at Triple-A Fresno.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: LHP Jason Vargas (left hamstring tightness) threw an extended bullpen Tuesday. He is eligible to come off the injured list Thursday. "We want Vargas to be the best version of himself when he comes back, so we're going to sit down and try to come up with a game plan to get him to that point, whether it's a rehab outing or just getting activated up here," Callaway said. ... LHP Steven Matz (forearm) threw a bullpen, one day after playing catch.	Nationals: SS Trea Turner, out since April 3 with a broken finger, played his second rehab game at Class A Potomac and went 0 for 4 with a walk and a throwing error. . RHP Trevor Rosenthal (viral infection) said he will pitch Friday and Saturday at Double-A Harrisburg.	UP NEXT	Mets: RHP Zack Wheeler (3-2, 4.35 ERA) starts the finale of the three-game series. He is 4-9 with a 5.01 ERA in 15 career starts against Washington.	Nationals: RHP Anibal Sanchez (0-6, 5.27) tries to avoid joining Jason Marquis (2010) as the only starting pitchers in Nationals history (2005-present) to open a season 0-7.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

PHILADELPHIA --  Milwaukee Brewers manager Craig Counsell sneaked peeks at the television in his office for a Bucks score as he praised another solid outing from Gio Gonzalez. Once the clubhouse doors opened, Brewers huddled around all the TVs and "Let's go Bucks!" was shouted when Milwaukee went up late in the NBA playoffs.	The Brewers aren't going to grab the bold headlines or get the most clicks in Milwaukee these days, at least not while the Bucks are playing. But the Brewers keep on winning and could give the city another reason to pay attention in the postseason.	Gonzalez continued to make the most of his second stint in Milwaukee, allowing one run while pitching into the sixth inning as the Brewers beat the Philadelphia Phillies 5-2 on Wednesday night.	"The thought process was just, try and keep us in there as long as possible," Gonzalez said.	Gonzalez (2-0) was hardly dazzling in his fourth start this season, but the veteran lefty did enough to again reward the Brewers' faith in bringing him back. Gonzalez finished last year with Milwaukee, going 3-0 in five starts down the stretch, and the Brewers made it to the NL Championship Series. But he was a free agent until he signed a minor league contract with the Yankees in March. After opting out of his deal with New York, he returned to a Milwaukee team in need of some rotation help.	"Gio's been a stabilizer in the whole thing," Counsell said.	Jesus Aguilar ripped a two-run single off Jake Arrieta (4-4) in the third to give the Brewers a 4-1 lead and they hung on to take two of the first three games of this four-game set between NL teams with playoff aspirations. Josh Hader tossed a scoreless ninth for his 11th save.	"With Hader doing what he does late in the game, it was just a little too late for us to get it going," Arrieta said.	The highlights for Milwaukee might get skimmed by fans nearly 900 miles away glued to Game 1 of the NBA's Eastern Conference final between the Bucks and Toronto Raptors.	Bryce Harper lined a double to left field and made a sliding catch in right a day after he banged his left knee into the wall on a sliding catch. Harper, who signed a $330 million, 13-year contract with the Phillies as a free agent, has been slumping and struck out for the 57th time. His double snapped an 0-for-15 funk that earned him some mild boos from Phillies fans who have been wild for the All-Star since the day he signed.	Philadelphia manager Gabe Kapler said he never considered giving Harper the day off.	"I don't have a tangible reason why we shouldn't play him," Kapler said. "We think he gives us our best chance to win tonight. We think he will be positively impacted by being in tonight's lineup. We'll consider it on a day-to-day basis. He and I will have those conversations."	Harper's arrival was just the biggest one in an offseason full of All-Star acquisitions for the Phillies. Two others were also in the middle of the action Wednesday. Jean Segura hit a solo homer in the first inning, but outfielder Andrew McCutchen misplayed a deep drive on the warning track in the fifth and the ball glanced off his glove for an error.	Arrieta was bailed out of that miscue by a sensational, barehand throw from third baseman Sean Rodriguez to nail Keston Hiura at first.	"I just didn't necessarily do my job tonight," Arrieta said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: C Manny Pina left in the third inning with right hamstring discomfort and will go on the disabled list. ... RHP Chase Anderson (finger laceration) will come off the injured list and start Saturday at Atlanta. His return pushes Freddy Peralta to the bullpen.	Phillies: INF Scott Kingery (strained right hamstring) played seven innings during a rehab game Tuesday at Class A Lakewood. Kapler said it was "probably a stretch" for Kingery to return to the Phillies this weekend. "He would be used and viewed in a similar fashion as he has been in the past with the Phillies, as an option to start at any position, third, short, second, center, left, right," Kapler said. ... RHP Victor Arano threw a 20-pitch bullpen Tuesday and needs a few more days before he returns from elbow inflammation. "I think he feels good about his progress. No setbacks," Kapler said.	DIEHARD FAN	Bruce Willis was booed in his No. 19 Phillies jersey when "The Sixth Sense " actor one-hopped the first pitch .	BIG BRAUN	Milwaukee slugger Ryan Braun is batting .408 (60 for 147) with 27 extra-base hits, 44 RBI and 38 runs in 37 career games at Citizens Bank Park.	UP NEXT	The Phillies send RHP Zach Eflin (5-3, 2.47 ERA) to the mound against RHP Zach Davies (4-0, 1.54) to complete the four-game series Thursday.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

BOSTON --  Michael Chavis had a simple thought as he walked to the plate.	"A single scores him. Don't try to be a Superhero and hit a home run or anything like that. Just need one," Chavis said Wednesday night after his walk-off single in the 10th inning gave the Boston Red Sox a 6-5 victory over the Colorado Rockies.	J.D. Martinez homered in his third straight game and Boston recovered after blowing a five-run lead.	Martinez hit a two-run shot and Eduardo Rodriguez struck out 10 over six innings for the Red Sox, who won for the 12th time in 15 games. They split the two-game set to remain unbeaten (13-0-4) in their last 17 interleague series at Fenway Park.	Trevor Story had a two-run single but exited with a left knee injury after a collision with a Rockies teammate. Tony Wolters doubled twice for Colorado, which had won four of five.	Xander Bogaerts opened the 10th with a double on the first pitch from Chad Bettis (1-3). After Rafael Devers was intentionally walked, Chavis hit a grounder up the middle on the next pitch to win it.	"Pitches in the zone," Red Sox manager Alex Cora said of the two-pitch rally. "You don't get too many of those, especially late in the game."	Brandon Workman (3-1) struck out David Dahl with two runners on to end the top of the 10th.	A night after Boston ace Chris Sale became the first pitcher in major league history to strike out 17 batters in seven innings -- and Colorado matched a franchise worst with 24 Ks -- Rodriguez had the Rockies whiffing again. They ended up with 16 strikeouts in all.	But, as on Tuesday when they rallied for a 5-4 victory in 11 innings, the Rockies overcame an early deficit.	"Going up against the world champs toe-to-toe, beat them last night, took them to the last round tonight, and they strung a couple of hits together there at the end," Colorado manager Bud Black said.	The bigger concern is Story, who came out after colliding with outfielder Raimel Tapia chasing a shallow fly down the left field line in the ninth.	"I think the trainers right now are optimistic," Black said. "Our medical staff looked at some of the replays on television. It looked like there was a collision and a hard contact to the knee. But cross our fingers that he's going to be OK. . Right now, we're cautiously optimistic."	Boston built a 5-0 lead with two runs in the first and three in the third against German Marquez, who entered 5-0 with a 2.02 ERA in nine career interleague starts.	In the seventh, the Rockies loaded the bases with nobody out against Rodriguez. Ryan McMahon singled and Wolters doubled before Rodriguez plunked Charlie Blackmon with a pitch and was pulled. Matt Barnes gave up Story's two-run single and, with Story running from first on a 3-2 pitch with one out, pinch-hitter Daniel Murphy bounced to second, scoring Blackmon to tie it.	Dahl had a sacrifice fly and Wolters a run-scoring double in the fourth to make it 5-2.	Mookie Betts' RBI single made it 3-0 before Martinez, unlike his other three homers the past four days that went over the Green Monster in left field, drove a slider into Boston's bullpen in right.	FIVE AND DONE	Both starters gave up five runs and were pulled in the seventh.	Rodriguez allowed nine hits and walked one. Marquez went 6 1/3 innings, striking out six with 10 hits and a walk.	"I think overall I did well," Marquez said through a translator.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rockies: Murphy, who entered batting just .200, started on the bench for the fifth time in seven games. Black said it had nothing to do with a fractured left index finger that caused Murphy to miss 3 1/2 weeks.	Red Sox: Cora said LHP David Price (on the injured list with left elbow tendinitis since May 3) is scheduled to throw a bullpen Friday and if it goes well, he'll "probably" start next week in Toronto. ... 2B Dustin Pedroia took grounders with the other infielders before batting practice as he continues to try to work back to a rehab assignment from soreness in his surgically repaired left knee that's limited him to nine games over the past two seasons.	UP NEXT	Rockies: After a day off Thursday, RHP Jon Gray (3-3, 4.25 ERA) is slated to start the opener of a three-game series in Philadelphia on Friday against LHP Cole Irvin (1-0, 1.29).	Red Sox: Off on Thursday before RHP Rick Porcello (3-3, 5.15) looks win his fourth straight decision Friday. Houston RHP Gerrit Cole (4-4, 3.88) is scheduled to start in the teams' first meeting since Boston defeated the Astros in the AL Championship Series last fall.	---	More AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

DETROIT --  Two seasons after being traded to Houston, Justin Verlander is still appreciated in the Motor City.	Verlander allowed two hits in seven impressive innings against his former team, and the Astros won their eighth straight game, 5-1 over the Detroit Tigers on Wednesday night. It was Verlander's second start at Comerica Park since his 2017 trade from Detroit to Houston. The crowd was sparse, but he received a nice little ovation after his last inning of work, and he waved to acknowledge the fans.	"It honestly is really special. I think for the most part of my career here, the fans were always incredible toward me," Verlander said. "What it comes down to is I always gave everything I had -- blood, sweat, tears. There was never anything left out there."	Verlander (7-1) struck out nine . JaCoby Jones homered off him in the third for the Tigers' only run, but with Miguel Cabrera out of the lineup, Detroit managed little offensively. The only significant jam Verlander faced was in the fifth, when Niko Goodrum lined out with the bases loaded.	Alex Bregman hit his 14th homer of the season, a solo shot off Gregory Soto (0-2) to open the scoring in the first. Bregman pulled within two home runs of teammate George Springer, the American League leader. Springer nearly hit one of his own, but Detroit left fielder Christin Stewart reached above the wall to make the catch in the fourth.	Verlander retired his first eight hitters before Jones connected for a 436-foot homer in the third. The right-hander rebounded by striking out the side in the fourth. With the bases loaded in the fifth and the Tigers down 3-1, Goodrum hit a line drive that second baseman Aledmys Diaz caught to end the inning.	The announced attendance was just 15,940 -- a far cry from the atmosphere for some of Verlander's starts when he was leading the Tigers to division titles in Detroit.	"It's kind of sad," he said. "I think most of my memories here, this ballpark was packed and fans were rowdy, and it's obviously a bit different now. But that comes with winning."	Jake Marisnick hit an RBI single for Houston in the second, and Robinson Chirinos added a sacrifice fly in the fourth. Detroit made two errors in the sixth, helping the Astros score another run.	Marisnick hit a run-scoring triple in the eighth to make it 5-1.	Soto was recalled from Double-A Erie before the game, and Detroit used him as a two-inning "opener" because its rotation is depleted by injury. Nick Ramirez relieved him and went four innings.	After the game, the Tigers optioned third baseman Jeimer Candelario to Triple-A Toledo.	"It was tough," manager Ron Gardenhire said. "He's one of my favorite guys in this clubhouse -- but we didn't think we had a choice. He's lost at the plate right now, and although he has been better defensively for most of the season, he's gotten sloppy in the last few games."	Houston has won 11 of 12, although this was a tamer offensive performance after the Astros scored 45 runs in their previous four games.	Ryan Pressly pitched the eighth for Houston, extending his scoreless innings streak to 37.	FAMILIAR FACES	Verlander beat Detroit at Comerica last September, but he lost to the Tigers when he faced them in Houston in July.	"All the guys I played with, I'm rooting for them," Verlander said. "I think you always root for your friends. You're not wishing ill will on anybody until I'm facing them."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: Cabrera missed the game because of a sore knee. Gardenhire did not seem to think it was a serious problem. Cabrera was injured most of last season, so Verlander didn't face him then either.	"We talked about it a bunch when we played together. I don't know what I would have done to him," Verlander said. "I've seen him be such a prodigious hitter for so long. You have all these moments in your head that you just have flashbacks to. And it's like, all right, well, he's hit that pitch, he's hit that pitch, he's hit that pitch."	UP NEXT	Astros: Houston is off Thursday before an AL Championship Series rematch at Boston. Gerrit Cole (4-4) starts the series opener for the Astros on Friday night against Rick Porcello (3-3).	Tigers: RHP Spencer Turnbull (2-2) takes the mound Thursday when Detroit opens a four-game set against Oakland. Chris Bassitt (1-1) starts for the Athletics.	---	Follow Noah Trister at www.Twitter.com/noahtrister	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

MIAMI --  Tampa Bay's pitchers dealt with lots of traffic on the bases, and paraded from their bullpen to the mound in a steady stream, which made for a most unorthodox shutout.	Seven pitchers combined on a seven-hitter, and the Rays blanked the Miami Marlins for the second consecutive game, 1-0 on Wednesday night.	"That game was fun," said Emilio Pagan, who escaped Miami's biggest threat in the sixth inning. "A 1-0 game -- that's old-time baseball right there, when the guys are grinding at-bats and making big pitches."	The Marlins (10-31) endured their seventh consecutive defeat and are on pace for 122 losses.	The only run scored in the second inning when catcher Anthony Bemboom, called up from the minors last week, doubled for his first major league hit and RBI . Bemboom sprained his left knee blocking a pitch in the fifth, left the game and will go on the injured list, manager Kevin Cash said.	"I just went down in an awkward position and felt a little instability in my knee," Bemboom said. "It's crazy -- I've made that move a thousand times before."	The AL East leaders improved to 2-7 in one-run games, and they're 14-5 on the road, best in the majors.	"Sometimes you've got to find a way to win a 1-0 game, and a lot of things have got to go your way," Cash said. "Our pitching was outstanding. We put ourselves in some tight, sticky situations, but it was impressive to watch to a man how they stepped up, took a deep breath and made big pitches."	The Marlins, who stranded 11 runners, went 0 for 10 with runners in scoring position. They're batting .200 in those situations this season.	"I see a bunch of guys grinding but trying to do too much," shortstop Miguel Rojas said. "It's really frustrating when you're on a bad streak like this. You're trying to hit a homer instead of just put the ball in play and let the guy behind you do the job too. That's the way we are right now."	The Marlins mounted so many threats it took 3 hours, 6 minutes to finish them off. Their best chance came in the sixth, when they had runners at second and third with none out, but Pagan escaped with the help of two strikeouts.	Rays second baseman Brandon Lowe made a diving stop to rob Starlin Castro of an RBI single and end the fifth.	Tampa Bay starter Ryne Stanek went one inning, and Jalen Beeks (3-0) threw three scoreless innings with four strikeouts. Diego Castillo pitched around a one-out walk in the ninth for his fifth save to help the Rays complete a two-game series sweep.	Miami has been shut out nine times and ranks last in the majors in in run, hits, doubles, triples, home runs, walks, on-base percentage and slugging.	"I don't think I've ever been through anything quite like this," manager Don Mattingly said. "I don't think there are any magic words at this point that are going to totally relax everybody and we're going to all start swinging the bats. We're going to have to individually come here and be better."	Jose Urena (1-6) allowed only one run in six innings. He has an ERA of 2.77 over his past six starts but is 1/3 during that span.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tampa Bay: 3B Diaz (sore left ankle) departed in the eighth, and PH Guillermo Heredia (bruised right hand) was hit by a pitch in the fifth inning, but X-rays were negative. Both are day to day. "We avoided some scares," Cash said.	Miami: RHP Drew Steckenrider (strained right elbow) visited specialist Dr. James Andrews, who confirmed the diagnosis and recommended rest. Steckenrider was placed on the 60-day injured list last week. ... Rojas (back spasms) left the game in the fifth inning but said the issue wasn't serious. His status is day to day.	UP NEXT	Rays: Following an off day, an opener is expected to start Friday for the beginning of a three-game series at the Yankees with first place in the division at stake. New York trails by half a game.	Marlins: Following an off day, RHP Trevor Richards (0-5, 4.46) is scheduled to start Friday against the Mets and RHP Jacob deGrom (3-4, 3.26). Richards is winless in eight starts even though opponents are batting .223 against him.	---	Follow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve-Wine .	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ATLANTA -- When Austin Riley connected with the pitch, his father was watching from the concourse at SunTrust Park.	Mike Riley knew it was good contact, but he couldn't tell how far the ball went.	Then he looked toward the outfield.	"As soon as I saw the outfielders not move," the elder Riley said, "I knew it was gone."	Austin Riley homered in his big league debut Wednesday night, leading Atlanta to a 4-0 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals and signaling the arrival of another top prospect for the Baby Braves.	"He's got lights-out power," said Hall of Famer Chipper Jones, who played his entire career with the Braves and was at the game. "I think he's a 40-homer guy before it's all said and done in the big leagues."	Mike Soroka turned in another strong start with three-hit ball over seven scoreless innings, but this night belonged to the 22-year-old Riley. He was called up from Triple-A Gwinnett before the game after Ender Inciarte went on the injured list with a sore back.	Riley, who started in left field and batted sixth, struck out swinging against Michael Wacha in the first at-bat of what the Braves hope will be a long major league career.	Then, leading off the fourth, Riley showed why he was leading the International League with 15 homers and 39 RBI.	Riley launched a high fastball deep into the left-field seats, a 438-foot drive that gave the Braves a 2-0 lead and sent his parents and a group of about 40 family and friends -- many of whom hastily made the drive from his native Mississippi -- into a delirious celebration.	"I'm speechless," Riley said, struggling to find the words. "That second at-bat, I figured he was going to challenge me a little bit. I was able to put a good swing on it."	Riley hit another drive to the edge of the warning track his next time up, and handled a couple of chances without any problem in left. Normally a third baseman, he figures to mostly play left field at least during his initial stint in the big leagues. Josh Donaldson is locked in at third base for 2019 with a one-year, $23 million deal.	After taking over as a defensive replacement for Riley, Charlie Culberson sealed the victory with a two-run homer in the eighth.	It was quite a showing for Atlanta's kids.	Even younger than Riley, the 21-year-old Soroka (4-1) lowered his ERA to 0.98 in six starts. The right-hander has yet to allow more than one earned run in any of his appearances, and this was his best one yet.	Soroka escaped a bases-loaded jam in the third, getting Paul Goldschmidt to ground into an inning-ending double play. He stared down another trouble spot in the sixth when the Cardinals put runners at second and third, fanning Jose Martinez to snuff out the threat.	"What I like about this kid is he doesn't panic. He just goes pitch to pitch," Braves manager Brian Snitker said. "That's a great trait for a young pitcher to have."	In the eighth, Dan Winkler walked the first two St. Louis hitters on eight pitches, but Luke Jackson worked out of the jam -- this time, it was Paul DeJong hitting into a double play -- and finished up for his fifth save in six chances.	Wacha (3-1) surrendered only four hits and one earned run over five innings.	"Anytime you've got somebody new coming in there, you don't really have too much video on that guy," Wacha said. "Obviously, I didn't want to make that pitch where he ended up hitting the homer, but he didn't miss a mistake."	Atlanta also scored when the Cardinals pitcher threw one away at third base after appearing to pick off Ronald Acuna Jr., who was able to trot home when the ball skidded under the glove of Matt Carpenter.	LUKE, YOU ARE OUR CLOSER	Jackson has been a godsend for Atlanta's shaky bullpen.	After giving up four runs in his first appearance of the season, he has surrendered just one over his past 19 innings and appears to be the closest thing the Braves have to a closer.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: RHP Carlos Martinez (shoulder) threw two innings for Double-A Springfield in an 8-2 loss to Arkansas on Wednesday. He allowed one run on four hits and could rejoin St. Louis for a weekend series in Texas.	Braves: Inciarte went on the 10-day injured list with a lumbar strain. He left Tuesday night's game after experiencing tightness in his lower back.	UP NEXT	In the rubber game of the series, RHP Adam Wainwright (3-3, 4.15) goes for the Cardinals against Atlanta RHP Julio Teheran (2-4, 4.26).	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Texas Rangers manager Chris Woodward was hoping Willie Calhoun's arrival from Triple-A Nashville would help ignite a club that had slogged through five straight losses.	Calhoun did exactly that.	A two-run homer in the first inning by the former top prospect set the tone, Ronald Guzman added a two-run shot of his own and the Rangers rolled to a 6-1 win over the Kansas City Royals on Wednesday night.	"He comes in and is kind of the spark player that gets us going," Woodward said about Calhoun. "I'm not surprised. I've seen that bat. He's got amazing hands with that swing. It was nice to see."	Shin-Soo Choo added a solo shot in the ninth inning and Nomar Mazara matched a career high with four hits as the Rangers won for the sixth time in their last eight games against Kansas City.	Mike Minor (4-3) got through five rocky innings, allowing one run on eight hits and two walks.	"I would grade it as a `C' by his standards," Woodward said. "But it showed a lot of our guys that you don't have to have your best stuff to be successful."	Guzman drove in a run in the fourth before sending a hanging pitch from Jorge Lopez (0-5) booming into the center field seats in the sixth. The two-out shot broke open a 3-1 game and sent Lopez, who had plunked two batters and struggled with command all night, trudging toward the showers.	Lopez allowed seven hits and two walks while striking out seven.	"Command got him," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "He was fighting command up to the point he elevated his pitch count. He got burned on his two center-cut curveballs for home runs."	Calhoun, called up from the minors before the game, got the Rangers off to a good start. The erstwhile elite prospect sent a first-inning pitch from Lopez soaring into the seats over the right-field bullpen, the no-doubt shot staking Texas to a 2-0 lead.	"His first night, he comes up and when you have a guy like Mike Minor pitching, getting ahead is huge," Mazara said. "He really got us going."	Kansas City answered by manufacturing a run in the bottom half against Minor, whose last appearance at Kauffman Stadium came as the Royals' closer in the final game of the 2017 season. But after Adalberto Mondesi's RBI single, the veteran left-hander escaped the rest of the inning unscathed.	It wasn't the last time he negotiated trouble.	Minor also stranded runners on second and third in the second and fourth, and he pinned another runner 90 feet from home in the fifth. By the time that inning ending, Minor had survived a shaky night and has still allowed just 11 earned runs over his last 55 innings.	"He was making pitches close to what he wanted to do. I just kept helping him out," the Royals' Whit Merrifield said. "He was throwing fastballs up and in, out of the zone. I don't know why I kept swinging at them, but I kept swinging at them."	The Rangers' bullpen allowed only one hit over the final four innings.	STATS AND STREAKS	Minor allowed leadoff singles in four consecutive innings. ... Calhoun's homer was the fourth of his career. ... Choo's homer snapped an 0-for-13 skid. ... Lopez and the Reds' Sonny Gray (0-4) are the only two pitchers in the majors with at least nine starts and no wins. ... Kansas City was 1 for 11 with runners in scoring position after going 9 for 19 the previous night.	INJURED ELVIS	Texas put shortstop Elvis Andrus on the injured list with a strained right hamstring after he left Tuesday night's game in the seventh inning. Woodward is hopeful Andrus will be ready to return in 10 days. "You don't want this to linger with him," Woodward said.	ROSTER MOVES	Calhoun was joined from Nashville by left-hander Jeffrey Springs to provide a fresh arm in the Texas bullpen. Right-hander Wei-Chieh Huang was optioned to the same club.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers right-hander Shawn Kelley could be activated in the next couple of days, Woodward said. Kelley has been dealing with a bacterial infection. ... Woodward said right-hander Ariel Jurado will likely start Saturday against St. Louis. Woodward plans to get "creative" with his starter Sunday because left-hander Drew Smyly has a slight ankle sprain and his next turn could get pushed back.	UP NEXT	The Royals wrap up their homestand Thursday by sending Homer Bailey (4-3, 4.83 ERA) to the mound against Texas right-hander Lance Lynn (4-3, 5.48). Kansas City has lost 12 straight rubber games dating to May 30 last year, and has not won a series against the Rangers since July 2016.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

LOS ANGELES -- Kenta Maeda dominated on the mound and helped himself at the plate.	The right-hander struck out 12 batters and drove in both runs in leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 2-0 victory over the San Diego Padres on Wednesday night.	"It's hard to imagine him being any better," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. "It was really, really fun to watch. He was great all night long."	Los Angeles wrapped up a 7-2 homestand, with four of the wins being shutouts.	Maeda gave up three hits over 6 2/3 innings and reached double-digit strikeouts for the fifth time in the majors. He finished one short of his career high for K's set in 2016 against San Diego.	"I was able to mix everything up tonight," Maeda said through an interpreter. "I did have the conviction and attacked the strike zone while keeping my pitch count to a minimum."	Maeda (5-2) had the key hit of the game, too, with a two-out, two-run bloop single to right field in the second. He became the first Dodgers pitcher to have two hits and two RBIs in a game since Zack Greinke in 2014.	Kenley Jansen worked the ninth for his 14th save, aided by a diving play up the middle from second baseman Enrique Hernandez. With two runners aboard, Jansen struck out Hunter Renfroe and pinch hitter Alex Dickerson to end it.	Jansen retired Renfroe for the second consecutive night after the slugger tagged him for a winning grand slam May 5 in San Diego.	Four Dodgers pitchers combined for a season-high 16 strikeouts. Maeda threw 85 pitches, 64 for strikes. His 22 swinging strikes were the second most in his career, according to Inside Edge, with 14 coming on his slider.	Matt Strahm (1-3) went five innings and gave up two runs and seven hits. The left-hander, who has a 2.33 ERA in five road starts, struck out five.	"Matt gave us an opportunity to win. He mixed well and could have easily had zero runs through five," Padres manager Andy Green said. "Those were soft hits that brought those runs in."	Corey Seager got two hits for the Dodgers.	Eric Hosmer had three of San Diego's four hits. The Padres dropped four of five on their trip and are 4-7 in their past 11 games overall.	TURNER'S STREAK	Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner was hit by a pitch for the fourth straight game. When he was plunked by Strahm's fastball in the second inning, Turner became the first Dodgers player since Hughie Jennings in 1900 to be hit in four consecutive games, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.	Turner has been hit by a pitch seven times this season, which is second in the National League.	HE LOVES L.A.	Hosmer is hitting .474 (9-for-19) against the Dodgers this season. He has hit safely in 11 of his past 12 games overall.	STREAKING	Manny Machado extended his hitting streak to eight games with a double in the fourth. The Padres' shortstop -- who was with the Dodgers during the second half and the postseason last year -- is batting .368 (7-for-19) with four home runs and seven RBIs against L.A.	BELLINGER WATCH	Dodgers right fielder Cody Bellinger had a rare 0-for-3 night but is still leading the majors with a .401 batting average. He walked in the fourth and has reached base safely in all 24 home games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: The earliest SS Fernando Tatis Jr. could return is Monday, as he continues to rehab from a strained left hamstring at the team's spring training facility in Arizona. The rookie sustained the injury April 28 while stretching to make a catch at second base.	Dodgers: LHP Hyun-Jin Ryu is scheduled to start Sunday's series finale in Cincinnati. Ryu, who has not given up a run in his past two outings, will have six days of rest between starts. He took a no-hitter into the eighth inning and threw a career-high 116 pitches Sunday against Washington.	UP NEXT	Padres: Return home to begin a four-game series Thursday night against Pittsburgh. LHP Eric Lauer (2-4, 5.75 ERA) looks to bounce back after giving up a career-high eight earned runs in last Friday's 12-2 loss at Colorado.	Dodgers: LHP Rich Hill (0-1, 4.20) takes the mound Friday in Cincinnati. Hill is 1-1 with a 2.53 ERA in his past two starts against the Reds.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

WASHINGTON --  The Washington Nationals survived a dramatic ninth inning to secure their first series win in a month.	Gerardo Parra hit a tiebreaking, two-run homer in the fifth and Sean Doolittle stopped the New York Mets' late rally by striking out Keon Broxton with the bases loaded for the final out of the Nationals' 7-6 win Thursday.	"You want the ball in his hand," Washington manager Dave Martinez said of Doolittle. "He goes out there, it's his to win or lose. He knows that. He battled through it and got a big out for us."	Brandon Nimmo walked leading off, pinch-hitter Todd Frazier doubled, and pinch-hitter Wilson Ramos and Juan Lagares hit run-scoring singles with one out. Dominic Smith hit an infield popup and Robinson Cano reached on an infield hit that loaded the bases.	Broxton swung through a 2-2 fastball, dropping his average to .143.	"It worked out as well as it could for those guys to come off the bench and get hits and keep us going like that and give us a chance with two outs bases loaded down one," Mets manager Mickey Callaway said.	Doolittle got his seventh save in eight chances.	"They weren't really hitting balls hard, just kind of finding some holes," catcher Kurt Suzuki said. "He's going to come right at you, guys know it. One of those days where he gave up some runs, which is unusual, but we found a way to win."	Michael Conforto hit a tying, three-run homer off Erick Fedde in the third inning but left with a concussion in the fifth after colliding with second baseman Cano's shoulder while chasing Howie Kendrick's popup down the right-field line. Rather than fly with the Mets to Miami, Conforto planned to take a train back to New York.	"I called it right away. He called it really late," Cano said. "It could have been something worse. Hopefully, he's good tomorrow."	Mets left fielder Jeff McNeil left in the third because of abdominal tightness.	Washington won two of three against the Mets for its first series win since April 16-18 against San Francisco. The Nationals, just 18-25, lost six straight series before splitting four games with the Los Angeles Dodgers last weekend.	New York dropped to 20-22 and is 0-5 in the finales of three-game series after splitting the first two games.	Mets starter Zack Wheeler (3-3) allowed six runs and a career-high 11 hits in six innings, raising his ERA to 4.85. Washington had five hits and two walks -- one intentional -- in a four-run first that included RBI doubles by Parra and Suzuki.	Parra was a triple short of the cycle and his home run put Washington ahead 6-4. Suzuki added an RBI single in the seventh off Robert Gsellman that drove in Parra, who had walked against Daniel Zamora and stolen second.	Dan Jennings (1-2) struck out two in a perfect fifth to win in relief of Anibal Sanchez, who left after 1 1/3 innings because of a strained left hamstring and will be placed on the injured list.	Conforto homered off Erick Fedde. Wheeler had not allowed a home run in his previous 32 1/3 innings.	PARRA POWER	In five games since joining the Nationals on May 9, Parra is batting .294 (5 for 17) with two doubles, two home runs, seven RBI and four runs.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: LHP Jason Vargas (left hamstring tightness) is to make an injury rehabilitation start on Sunday for Double-A Binghamton. ... LHP Steven Matz (forearm irritation) said he felt good after a 45-pitch bullpen session on Wednesday and is ready to return.	Nationals: SS Trea Turner, out since April 3 with a broken right index finger, worked out at Nationals Park after playing all nine innings of rehab games Tuesday and Wednesday at Class A Potomac. He could be activated as early as Friday	UP NEXT	Mets: RHP Jacob deGrom (3-4, 3.26) starts the opener of a three-game series at Miami. He is 6-6 with a 3.24 ERA in 18 starts versus the Marlins.	Nationals: RHP Max Scherzer (2-4, 3.64) opens a three-game series against the visiting Chicago Cubs. He has struck out 11 in three of his last four starts against the Cubs.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.

PHILADELPHIA --  Christian Yelich took advantage of the few pitches he saw in the zone.	Yelich hit his major league-leading 17th and 18th homers to help Zach Davies and the Milwaukee Brewers beat the Philadelphia Phillies 11-3 Thursday.	Yasmani Grandal and Mike Moustakas also went deep as the Brewers won their third in a row after losing the series opener against the NL East-leading Phillies.	Davies (5-0) allowed three runs -- one earned -- and four hits in six innings. He pitched out of trouble often because of four errors behind him.	Yelich homered to right-center in the first for a 1-0 lead off Zach Eflin (5-4). He added a solo drive off Edgar Garcia in the eighth to make it 8-3. The reigning NL MVP has three of his five career multi-homer games this season.	Yelich had three hits and scored three times, and is batting .342. The Phillies pitched around him most of the series.	"You just trust in your teammates, trust in the guy behind you to do some damage," Yelich said. "The goal is to get on base, keep the line moving."	Ryan Braun provided protection in the lineup for Yelich, adding three more hits to increase his career average at Citizens Bank Park to .417 (63 for 151) with 27 extra-base hits and 45 RBI in 38 games.	"I'm going to petition the league to play our next series against the Phillies here," Braun joked.	The slugger is more impressed with Yelich's hitting.	"I've never seen anybody this good for this long," Braun said. "It's really special."	Grandal hit a three-run shot off Seranthony Dominguez in the seventh and Moustakas took Austin Davis deep in the ninth.	Jean Segura hit a solo homer for the Phillies.	"They outplayed us from every angle," Phillies manager Gabe Kapler said.	Eflin gave up four runs and seven hits in five innings. He tossed two complete games in his previous three starts, including a four-hitter last Saturday at Kansas City.	Davies helped himself at the plate, too. He doubled and scored in the third, and got an RBI with a bunt single in the fourth.	"It was good to bounce back," Davies said about the Brewers losing two of three to the Cubs in the previous series. "Our offense opened up."	MR. CONSISTENT	Davies has allowed two earned runs or fewer in each of his first nine starts this season, the longest such streak to start a season in Brewers history.	CHASING PRINCE	With still 12 games remaining in the month, Yelich already has more home runs (18) than any Brewers player before June 1 since 2007, when Prince Fielder hit 19.	BRYCE BUMPED	Kapler moved slumping Bryce Harper up from the No. 3 spot in the batting order to second. Harper went 1 for 4 with a strikeout. He's hitting .180 (9 for 50) with 20 strikeouts in May.

DETROIT --  Tired after a long trip, the Oakland Athletics felt a little sluggish.	But once they hit Comerica Park, they again turned sluggerish.	Jurickson Profar launched his first career grand slam and the A's routed Detroit 17-3 Thursday for their 13th straight victory over the Tigers.	The A's had lost three straight and were 1-10 in their last 11 road games before romping. They arrived in Detroit after a 4-3 loss at Seattle on Tuesday night.	"I think we were really feeling wiped out this morning," A's catcher Josh Phegley said. "It really didn't feel like we had an off day with a night game, a long flight and then a day game, but it almost gave us a chip on our shoulder out there."	Phegley had four hits and drove in four runs. He had one of Oakland's five home runs as the A's won their eighth in a row at Comerica Park.	Phegley is hitting .295 with an .835 OPS this year.	"If you are looking for All-Star catchers this season, I don't know anyone more worthy than Josh," manager Bob Melvin said. "He's hitting close to .300 and he's giving us homers and RBI. You don't see that from the nine spot very often."	Detroit has been outscored 41-9 while losing the first four games of a 10-game homestand.	"I've lost games like that before I'm sure I'll lose them again," Tigers second baseman Josh Harrison said. "This is a tough stretch, but you can't get embarrassed. You just forget about it and try to win the next one."	Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire was forced to use outfielder Brandon Dixon to pitch the ninth inning -- the infielder/outfielder, who had two scoreless appearances on the mound for Cincinnati last year, gave up a two-run homer to Mark Canha.	"I hate doing that -- I absolutely hate it," Gardenhire said. "I've been managing for a long time and that's only the second time I've ever done it. There was just no one left in our bullpen and Brandon told me he did a few times last year with Cincinnati, so I put him out there."	Matt Olson and Marcus Semien also homered for Oakland.	Ohio native Chris Bassitt (2-1) pitched eight shutout innings in front of a large group of friends and family.	"I not only saw all of his fans, I heard them," Melvin said. "They were the ones booing me when I took him out."	Three of Bassitt's six career wins have come against the Tigers, all at Comerica Park.	"This is basically my home away from home," said Bassitt, who grew up about 90 minutes away. "I was blessed to live so close to a great pitcher's park."	Spencer Turnbull (2-3) took the loss for Detroit, allowing six runs, only one of which was earned, on five hits and two walks. He was the fourth straight Tigers starter to fail to reach the fifth inning.	Dawel Lugo hit a three-run homer with two outs in the Tigers ninth off Aaron Brooks.	The Tigers had the game's first scoring chance when Ronny Rodriguez tripled with one out in the second inning, but he was thrown out at the plate trying to score on Harrison's grounder to third.	The A's then scored six times in the third. The Tigers missed a pair of double-play opportunities and Oakland got a run when Turnbull struck out Khris Davis on a wild pitch. Profar made it 6-0 with his slam.	"Our starting pitching has to be better, because we're killing the bullpen, but this game starts with catching the ball," Gardenhire said. "Spencer didn't have his best stuff, but when you ask him to get five or six outs in an inning, you make it that much worse."	Phegley hit a two-run homer in the sixth and Olson added a solo homer later in the inning. Phegley's fourth hit gave the A's a 10-run lead in the seventh, and Semien followed with a three-run drive.	"It's a whole lot easier to pitch with that kind of lead," Bassitt said. "You just have to keep from beating yourself."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: RHP Jharel Cotton (elbow) will start a rehab assignment on Friday with Class A Stockton. Cotton has been out since undergoing Tommy John surgery in March 2018. ... LF Nick Martini is hitting .357 in five rehab games with Triple-A Las Vegas.	Tigers: RHP Jordan Zimmermann (elbow) suffered a muscle strain while working out, but Gardenhire doesn't expect it to change his return date. Zimmermann is expected to be out for at least another month. . Detroit designated RHP Reed Garrett for assignment and recalled RHP Sandy Baez from Triple-A Toledo. As a Rule 5 pick, Garrett will be offered back to the Texas Rangers if he clears waivers.	NO GREENE IN A BLOWOUT	Gardenhire did have another option for the ninth inning -- closer Shane Greene. Because of Detroit's struggles, Greene hasn't pitched since Sunday and has only worked twice in the last 11 days.	"We need to get him an inning and he really wants to be out there, but not on a day like that," Gardenhire said. "Nothing good was going to come out of that inning. Hopefully, we can get him some work with a lead tomorrow."	UP NEXT	The teams play the second of four games on Friday night, with Oakland's Frankie Montas (4-2, 2.78 ERA) facing Detroit's Daniel Norris (2-1, 3.63).	---	More AP MLB coverage: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Rougned Odor and the rest of the Texas Rangers had been using the Kansas City Royals' beleaguered pitching staff for batting practice most of the sun-splashed afternoon.	Then the Rangers used Kansas City's backup second baseman for it, too.	One of Odor's two homers came off Chris Owings, who was summoned by the Royals in the eighth inning to try to close out the 16-1 blowout Thursday. Hunter Pence also went deep off the utility man as Texas hit five homers in all, piled up 21 hits and won the rubber game of the three-game series.	"We've done a good job of salvaging the last couple of games," said Lance Lynn, who earned the win with a strong start that ultimately got lost amid the barrage of runs.	"For me, I have a chance to ride a loss or a win from the night before," he said. "That's always my motto. Whatever happened the night before I want to get the team going."	Calhoun and Joey Gallo each homered among their four hits, and Danny Santana also had four knocks, though some of that damage came off a utilityman. Royals manager Ned Yost wanted to save his bullpen for an upcoming road trip, so he called Owings off the bench in the eighth inning.	"I told him, `Look, don't be stupid," Yost said, "but he did a great job of saving our `pen."	Lynn (5-3) allowed a run in the first but little else over the next six innings as the Rangers won their first road series in nine tries. Their last one came last September in San Diego.	Homer Bailey (4-4) allowed six runs, eight hits and four walks in an all-around dismal day for the Kansas City pitching staff. Brad Boxberger coughed up three runs in relief of him as the Royals lost the rubber game of a series for the 13th consecutive time dating to last season.	Kansas City actually struck in the first when youngster Nicky Lopez, capping a solid debut series, hit the first of his two doubles and Adalberto Mondesi followed with a sacrifice fly. But Lynn and the Rangers controlled the game the rest of the way.	They pulled even on Gallo's homer to left leading off the fourth, then battered Bailey and the bullpen by sending five runs across during the decisive fifth inning.	It started with a leadoff walk to Isaih Kiner-Falefa, continued with consecutive singles by Danny Santana, Calhoun and Nomar Mazara, and included two more walks by Bailey that sent in a run.	The veteran right-hander was finally yanked from the game, and Brad Boxberger appeared to have the Royals out of the inning when he induced Odor to hit a groundball. First baseman Ryan O'Hearn was able to field the ball cleanly but threw it away, keeping their misery going.	"There was a couple of hits. We missed being in the right spot cutoff-wise, trying to hold the game right there," Yost said. "Brought in Boxberger and throwing error broke it open for them."	Texas pushed across three more runs in the sixth, drawing a trio of walks off Boxberger and former closer Wily Peralta. It was the second straight inning the Rangers batted through the order.	"It's kind of what we've been doing all year," Rangers manager Chris Woodward said. "It was a 1-1 game going into the fifth. Homer Bailey was doing OK at that point. Those at-bats (in the fifth) kind of set the tone for the rest of the game. Big hits, big walks. That's something we pride ourselves on. If you get a good pitch, take a rip. If not, let the next guy do it."	NICE JOB, NICKY	Lopez was the Royals' lone bright spot. Along with an RBI double, the 24-year-old rookie doubled in the third and drew a walk in the sixth while playing solid defense at solid second base.	STATS AND STREAKS	The Rangers have won five of six against Kansas City. They also have won nine of their last 11 at Kauffman Stadium. ... Texas had lost 15 of 20 on the road. ... The Royals had committed a league-low 14 errors before O'Hearn's miscue in the fifth inning. ... Owings allowed four runs on six hits and a walk while retiring five batters, giving him a 21.60 ERA for his career.	UP NEXT	The Rangers intend to use openers the first two games of their weekend series against St. Louis, though Woodward was not ready to say who they will be. The Royals head to Los Angeles to face the Angels on Friday night with Brad Keller (2-4, 4.47 ERA) on the mound.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

CLEVELAND --  Jason Kipnis got his first four RBI on two homers, and two more on a strange play.	"I'll take it, though," Kipnis said, smiling.	Maybe the Indians have finally found their groove.	Kipnis homered twice and drove in a career-high six runs as Cleveland showed more signs of busting out at the plate by hammering the Baltimore Orioles 14-7 in the opener of a four-game series Thursday night.	Kipnis hit a solo shot in the first inning, a three-run homer in the fourth off reliever Gabriel Ynoa (0-1) and was credited with two RBI on an unusual fielder's choice in a five-run seventh when his grounder never left the infield.	Following a pregame meeting called by manager Terry Francona, the Indians were down 5-1 before rallying, falling behind and then taking the lead for good on Carlos Santana's hard-smash RBI single in the sixth.	The Indians, who have struggled to score, broke it open with a five-run seventh.	"I thought we played with some personality tonight," Francona said. "We got down early and instead of feeling sorry for ourselves, they kept fighting and good things happened. We ran the bases really well. We were aggressive."	Trey Mancini hit a three-run homer and Rio Ruiz had a two-run drive for Baltimore, which has lost seven of eight. The Orioles dropped three games in 24 hours after being swept in a doubleheader by the Yankees on Wednesday.	"We let them hang around and kind of lost control of the game as it went on," Mancini said. "Not one of our better games overall. Probably one of our worst."	A.J. Cole (1-1) replaced starter Trevor Bauer in the sixth and picked up his first win for the Indians, whose bats have finally awakened the past two games. They followed up a 9-0 win at Chicago on Tuesday with their most hits and runs in 2019 to successfully open an 11-game homestand.	"We knew we weren't going to play that way that we did at the beginning of the season the whole time," said Kipnis, who began the season on the injured list with a calf strain. "Things are about to turn. Numbers always average out a little bit. But we knew that we can't wait for them to come. You've got to kind of play the game hard and the right way.	"We had a nice little meeting today that kind of refocused us from Tito (Francona) and he just said, `Hey, you might not be able to control always the results, but let's control our hustle. Let's control doing the little things,' and I thought it paid dividends real fast for us today."	Cleveland tacked on five in the seventh, with Kipnis' high-hopper to second scoring two when the Orioles failed to record an out on what could have been an inning-ending double play.	Second baseman Hanser Alberto fielded Kipnis' ball, but he didn't tag Francisco Lindor and then threw too late to first to get Kipnis.	The indecision summed up Baltimore's night.	"It was a couple of odd plays," manager Brandon Hyde said. "They had some breaks and we didn't. That made it an unreachable game."	BAUER DOWN	Bauer has given up at least seven runs in two of his past three outings. He's got a 6.17 ERA in home starts, and 2.40 on the road.	"I've got to be better," he said. "My teammates, the organization, the fans depend on me to go out there and be better than I am right now, and I need to live up those expectations."	On a positive note, Bauer notched his 1,000th career strikeout.	NO RELIEF	The Orioles' bullpen has allowed a major league-leading 121 runs.	After starter Dan Straily was chased, Baltimore's relievers gave up 10 runs, eight hits and six walks in 4 2/3 innings.	"You can't win in this league unless you're putting up zeros out of your `pen," Hyde said. "We have to do a better job of pitching overall. It wasn't our night on the mound."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: LHP Richard Bleier (shoulder tendinitis) was activated from the 10-day injured list and appeared in the seventh. He had 14.54 ERA before being placed on the IL on April 11.	Indians: An MRI revealed more than a left calf strain for OF Tyler Naquin, who can't do baseball activities for two weeks. Naquin, placed on the injured list Tuesday, has some swelling behind his knee. "He's a tough kid who was probably playing through something he shouldn't have," Francona said. ... RHP Danny Salazar has resumed throwing side sessions in Arizona after receiving a cortisone shot in his shoulder.	UP NEXT	Orioles: RHP Dylan Bundy (1-5, 5.31 ERA) has allowed 11 home runs this season after giving up an AL-high 41 in 2018.	Indians: RHP Jefry Rodriguez (1-2, 2.92 ERA) will try to make it two straight wins after getting his first with Cleveland last week in Baltimore. Rodriguez made his first career start against the Orioles in 2018 for Washington.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

CINCINNATI --  A heavy rain was turning the field slick. The grounds crew was waiting to fetch the tarp. Eugenio Suarez knew this might be the Reds' best chance to take control and win a series.	Suarez singled home the go-ahead run during a fifth-inning downpour and added another RBI single Thursday night as Cincinnati pulled away to a 4-2 victory that slowed the Chicago Cubs' momentum.	Chicago came into the series on the best surge in the majors, having won or split 10 straight series. The NL Central leaders let a late lead get away Wednesday night for a 6-5, 10-inning loss.	This one literally slipped away as the rain intensified in the bottom of the fifth inning.	"Just a really strange inning, and the weather was pretty awful," manager Joe Maddon said.	Jose Quintana (4-3) gave up Jose Peraza's solo homer with one out, his first since April 26. After a pair of singles, Quintana threw back-to-back wild pitches off the sloppy mound that let in a run.	"That was tough," Quintana said. "I slipped on a couple of pitches. It was really clean before that."	Suarez's two-out single made it 3-2 . He added another RBI single in the seventh, and the bullpen held the Cubs to a pair of hits the rest of the way.	"That was tough, but everybody knows that it's part of the game," Suarez said of the conditions. "You have to be ready for every possibility."	Luis Castillo (5-1) gave up two runs on two hits and a walk, all in the first inning. The Cubs got a break when Wilson Contreras' grounder down the line hit the front edge of third base and caromed away from Suarez for a two-run double.	Castillo retired his next 14 batters after the bad-hop hit.	"He kept his composure," manager David Bell said. "He didn't let it faze him. That's part of his growth and confidence. He just kept pitching."	The umpires called for the tarp after Kyle Schwarber lined out to start the sixth inning. Neither starter returned after a one-hour, 51-minute delay.	Raisel Iglesias retired the side in the ninth for his ninth save in 11 chances.	Kris Bryant walked in his first plate appearance, extending his career-best streak to 25 games reaching base safely. It's the longest streak by a Cub since Ben Zobrist also reached in 25 straight games in 2017.	Javier Baez doubled and singled, extending his hitting streak to a career-high 14 games. It's the longest by a Cub since Anthony Rizzo's identical streak in 2017.	CUBS MOVE	Catcher Victor Caratini returned from the 10-day injury list and Taylor Davis was optioned to Triple-A Iowa. Caratini broke a bone in his left hand during a swing on April 11 and had surgery. He started at first base for Chicago and went 0 for 3 with a pair of strikeouts.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: Rizzo hit pregame again and reported his back was much better. He was out of the lineup for a fourth straight game. Maddon expects him back during a weekend series in Washington, bringing the Cubs' offense closer to full strength. Their four hits Thursday matched their season low.	"We're missing Anthony in the lineup, too," Maddon said. "That's a difference-maker for us."	Reds: 2B Scooter Gennett expects to start on-field activities later this month. He suffered a groin injury during spring training. There's no estimate when he might be able to resume playing.	LONG TIME	The Cubs hadn't lost back-to-back games since April 24-25 against the Dodgers. They've won 13 of their last 17 games.	TWICE AS NICE	Cincinnati's Joey Votto had a pair of singles -- only his second multi-hit game in May -- and extended his hitting streak to a season-high five games. Votto is 9 for 55 (.164) with three RBI in the month.	CAREER BEST	Jose Iglesias singled, extending his hitting streak to seven games, the longest of his career. It matches Jessie Winker's seven-game streak for longest by a Red this season.	UP NEXT	Cubs: Left-hander Cole Hamels (3-0) opens a series in Washington, facing Max Scherzer (2-4). Hamels allowed one run in seven innings during his last start against Milwaukee.	Reds: Anthony DeSclafani (2-1) starts a series against the Dodgers, who start left-hander Rich Hill (0-1). The Dodgers are 33-22 at Great American Ball Park, the second-best winning percentage by an opponent behind the Mets.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

ATLANTA --  Austin Riley's major league career is just getting started, and Braves manager Brian Snitker likes where it's headed.	"I love everything about what he's doing," Snitker said. "He's in a good place offensively. He's confident and rightly so from where he came from and what he's doing. He's just carrying it over."	Riley went 3 for 4 and drove in a run, Julio Teheran pitched five-plus scoreless innings, and the Atlanta Braves won for the fifth time in six games with a 10-2 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals on Thursday night.	Riley, who homered in his second major league at-bat Wednesday, doubled off the top of the wall in the second inning and singled in a run in the third. He scored twice.	He's hitting .407 with 32 RBI over his last 20 games between Atlanta and Triple-A Gwinnett.	"Coming into this, I told myself, `Same game, got to have the same approach, go up there with a plan, not just free swinging," Riley said. "I think I stuck to that pretty well."	Teheran (3-4) allowed two hits -- a bloop single by Yadier Molina to begin the fifth and a single by Paul Goldschmidt to begin the sixth -- and drove in two runs with a sacrifice bunt in the second and a single in the third. Teheran, who has a 0.53 ERA over his last three starts, walked four and struck out four.	"I feel like the way I believe I've been pitching lately -- I guess it's been five starts -- I've really been feeling the way I like to feel," Teheran said. "I feel like I can throw my pitches in any counts and my command -- I walk guys, but that's part of the game. I really like the way I've been feeling."	Nick Markakis had an RBI double in the three-run third as Atlanta took a 5-0 lead.	The Braves led 2-0 in the second. Markakis walked, advanced to third on Riley's double and crossed the plate on Brian McCann's sacrifice fly. Riley scored from third on Teheran's bunt.	Cardinals starter Adam Wainwright (3-4) gave up five runs, five hits and five walks with two strikeouts in four innings.	"It's the worst fastball command I've had all year," Wainwright said. "I actually had a good fastball, but I just didn't locate it worth a darn, and worst breaking ball I've had all year. Bad combo."	Marcel Ozuna's 13th homer cut the lead to 5-1 in the sixth off Jacob Webb. Matt Carpenter homered off Touki Toussaint to make it 9-2 in the eighth.	Atlanta went up 8-1 in the bottom of the sixth on RBI singles by Freddie Freeman, Josh Donaldson and Markakis. Ronald Acuna Jr.'s RBI single in the seventh made it 9-1, and Freeman hit his eighth homer in the eighth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	RHP Carlos Martinez will rejoin the Cardinals' bullpen this weekend at Texas after missing 44 games a right shoulder cuff strain. "You're talking about a legitimate weapon, a two-time All-Star who proved he could do the job out of the bullpen last year," St. Louis manager Mike Shildt said. "You always want to be able to shorten games."	STILL IN ROTATION	Snitker said RHP Mike Foltynewicz will make his next start even though he's 0-3 with an 8.02 ERA in four starts. Foltynewicz, a first-time All-Star last year, threw a bullpen session Thursday as pitching coach Rick Kranitz and bullpen coach Marty Reed began adjusting his mechanics. "They identified some things on tape and saw some things that maybe can help him," Snitker said. Foltynewicz, whose season started late because of a right elbow bone spur, will face Milwaukee on Sunday.	UMPIRE CHANGE	Home plate umpire Manny Gonzalez left because of an illness before the top of the fifth and was replaced by first base umpire Jim Wolf. Crew chief Sam Holbrook stayed at third, and Dan Iassogna moved from second to first.	UP NEXT	Cardinals: RHP Miles Mikolas (4-3, 3.83 ERA) will make his 10th start when St. Louis begins a three-game series at Texas. In four career starts in the Rangers' ballpark, the former Texas hurler is 0-4 with a 13.73 ERA.	Braves: LHP Max Fried (5-2, 3.25 ERA) will make his ninth start as Atlanta begins a three-game home series Friday against the Brewers. Fried lasted three innings in his only start against Milwaukee, giving up four runs and four hits and walking three in three innings last July 7.	---	For more AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/apf-Baseball and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

CHICAGO --  Ryan Cordell took a deep breath at the plate after reading the sign from Chicago White Sox third base coach Nick Capra.	Then he locked in and executed perfectly.	Yolmer Sanchez raced home from third base with the tiebreaking run on Cordell's suicide squeeze in the eighth inning, and the White Sox topped the Toronto Blue Jays 4-2 Thursday night for their fourth win in five games.	With runners at the corners and the infield in, Cordell bunted to the first base side. Toronto reliever Derek Law (0-1) threw to catcher Danny Jansen, but Sanchez slid under the tag to give Cordell his second RBI of the game and Chicago a 3-2 lead.	After twice getting signs for a safety squeeze and taking a ball when he could swing away, Cordell said Law's low pitch was just what he was looking for.	"I've had a couple of them now, safeties, not the suicide squeeze, so it was a little different," Cordell said. "Fortunately I got a decent pitch to put the bat on the ball.	"When I got to first base and looked in and see the dugout going nuts, that's a real exciting thing."	Charlie Tilson then scored on Leury Garcia's sacrifice fly. Tilson was originally ruled out on Billy McKinney's throw, but the call was overturned following a replay review.	Kelvin Herrera (1-2) pitched around two walks in a scoreless eighth to get the win. Alex Colome tossed a perfect ninth for his ninth save in nine chances, completing a two-hitter.	Welington Castillo also drove in a run for Chicago.	Freddy Galvis hit a solo shot for his sixth homer and first in more than a month, but the Blue Jays lost for the fourth time in five games as their offense continued to sputter. Toronto entered with a major league-worst .216 batting average.	"It's been a struggle for our offense. Can't explain it," manager Charlie Montoyo said. "But the positive side is that (Marcus) Stroman gave us a chance. He was outstanding."	Stroman permitted two runs (one earned) and seven hits through six innings, striking out six. He hasn't won since April 19 and was hit hard in his previous three outings, giving up 12 earned runs over 14 1/3 innings.	White Sox starter Dylan Covey allowed two runs (one earned) on two hits and a pair of walks in 5 2/3 innings in his best outing this season. After giving up Galvis' homer and Brandon Drury's single to start the second, the right-hander retired 12 straight until Eric Sogard walked leading off the sixth -- and came around to tie it at 2 with an unearned run.	Covey entered with a 5.91 ERA and was roughed up for four runs in 4 2/3 innings at Toronto last Friday when he walked five.	"For me today it was just to attack the zone and not let walks beat me, "Covey said. "Just throw strikes, pound the (strike) zone and let the defense play."	The White Sox jumped out to a 1-0 lead in the first on Castillo's RBI single with two outs. Galvis led off the second with his drive to right-center.	Chicago went back ahead 2-1 in the fourth when Nicky Delmonico scored from third on Cordell's infield single	Toronto pushed across a run without a hit in the sixth to tie it at 2 and chase Covey.	Sogard scored from third with two outs when third baseman Yoan Moncada fielded Randal Grichuk's sharp grounder, but threw wide to first for an error. Evan Marshall entered and got Galvis to ground out.	BLUE JAYS MOVES	Toronto recalled INF Richard Urena and optioned struggling OF Teoscar Hernandez to Triple-A Buffalo. In 39 games with the Blue Jays, Hernandez hit .189 with three homers and 15 RBI. Since May 1, he was batting just .114 (4 for 35).	Urena started the season with the Blue Jays and entered Thursday hitting .313 in 11 games during two stints with Toronto this year.	ROCK AND ROLL	McKinney smacked hard into the left field fence catching Sanchez's drive in the fourth, then somersaulted forward, landed on his feet and threw back to the infield in one motion.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: Clayton Richard (right knee stress fracture), one of four Toronto starters on the injured list, threw a bullpen. Before the game, Montoyo said Richard might make his Blue Jays debut in Chicago on Saturday, but afterward announced the left-hander would first make a rehab start in the minors. Montoyo didn't yet know where. Toronto acquired the 35-year-old lefty and cash from the Padres for OF Connor Panas last December.	White Sox: SS Tim Anderson was held out of the starting lineup for rest, but was available off the bench. ... LHP Manny Banuelos, who left Tuesday's loss to Cleveland in the fifth inning with a left shoulder strain, had a "clean" MRI according to manager Rick Renteria and is day-to-day. There is a chance Banuelos won't miss his next turn in the rotation.	UP NEXT	Toronto RHP Aaron Sanchez (3-4, 3.75 ERA) faces Chicago RHP Ivan Nova (2-3, 6.29) on Friday. Sanchez has lost three straight, with a 6.35 ERA during that stretch. Nova has won his last two starts, yielding only two runs in 13 innings.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

SEATTLE --  Sometime during a fourth inning in which the Minnesota Twins sent 13 batters to the plate, their confidence really started to soar.	Viral video star C.J. Cron and Byron Buxton homered in an error-fueled outburst that included seven hits and 11 baserunners, sending Minnesota past the Seattle Mariners 11-6 on Thursday night for its third straight victory and eighth in 11 games.	"There's a contagious, positive energy that goes on" in an inning like that, Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. "When you step to the plate, you're probably truly believing that you're going to get on base. I think it's something that happens when you have a good group. When you have a good offensive group, you have the opportunity to do that, whether it's a few batters or 13. That good energy is tangible and I think it's something that's very real."	While starting pitcher Michael Pineda (3-3) was the biggest beneficiary of that energy in his return to Seattle, Cron was definitely happy to be at the heart of the Twins' win with a 4-for-5 effort a day after making an embarrassing error in a win against the Angels that went viral and had his teammates grinding on him all day.	"You have to poke fun at people," Cron said. "It keeps the clubhouse loose. It keeps us having fun, more importantly. In order to win games, you have to have that team camaraderie, and I think we have a really good group of guys in here."	That group started with Pineda on Thursday night.	The former Mariners right-hander struck out six with no walks and scattered five hits over seven innings, his longest outing of the season.	"He went deep, he threw strikes, he had that good slider we've talked about," Baldelli said. "And truthfully, I think he had good life on his fastball. He commanded the ball very well. It was a great start."	Pineda was hit hard occasionally, giving up three solo home runs, but had few concerns once that fourth inning got rolling with Cron's mammoth two-run homer to left field that was four rows from leaving the ballpark to make it 4-1. Cron's portion of the homer barrage helped the Twins reach 11 straight games with a home run -- their longest streak in two years. They now have 80, third in the majors, and they've hit multiple homers in 21 of 42 games.	Leading 2-1 after solo home runs from Jason Castro and Max Kepler in the third against starter Erik Swanson (1-5), Minnesota put together its biggest inning of the season in the fourth.	Marwin Gonzalez followed Cron's homer with a single, and Miguel Sano's double put runners at second and third.	Castro then grounded to first baseman Edwin Encarnacion behind the bag. Instead of stepping on the base, Encarnacion made a quick, flat-footed throw home trying to get Gonzalez, but was off the mark and the error made it 5-1.	Buxton followed with a three-run homer for an 8-1 margin, ending Swanson's night after he gave up nine hits in three-plus innings.	Parker Markel hit Kepler with a pitch, then gave up a single to Jorge Polanco before the Mariners finally got the first out of the inning by nabbing Polanco as he tried to turn a poor relay throw from the outfield into another base.	Markel struck out Jonathan Schoop for the second out and should have been out of the inning when Cron hit a soft fly to center field. But Mallex Smith, recalled Thursday from Triple-A Tacoma, dropped the ball for Seattle's league-leading 49th error. Kepler scored to make it 9-1.	"Once we had those runs, Big Mike did nothing but shove," Cron said.	All of Seattle's runs came on homers. Smith hit a solo shot in the second, and Ryon Healy and J.P. Crawford connected for back-to-back solo drives in the fifth. It was the first home run with the Mariners for Crawford, one of the team's top prospects.	Daniel Vogelbach added a three-run homer in the eighth off reliever Tyler Duffey. The Mariners have scored 131 of their 246 runs, 53%, on their league-leading 87 home runs. But the errors -- the Mariners lead the league with 49 -- did them in again.	"We gave them six outs in that inning, and that really turned the game," manager Scott Servais said. "You can't give a team like that that many free outs."	CRUZ RETURNS	For the first time since signing with Minnesota, slugger Nelson Cruz made his return to T-Mobile Park to the delight of the Mariners, who miss the presence of their ebullient former teammate. Cruz did not play because of a recent wrist injury, but is expected in the lineup for the remaining three games of the series, with left-handed pitchers scheduled for Seattle. "I hope he's not in our nap room," Servais joked. "I might have to stop in there. He might be in there for all we know."	Baldelli said he sees why Cruz was such a favorite in Seattle: "He gets the clubhouse in a lot of ways to come together very, very well. It takes a special guy to do that."

SAN DIEGO -- Ian Kinsler hit a mighty three-run homer to put the San Diego Padres ahead of the Pittsburgh Pirates, and then had a profane outburst as he crossed home and then again in the dugout.	Many fans on social media felt it was directed at them, and manager Andy Green said it "was not the right response."	Kinsler, who hasn't been a fan favorite as he has struggled since joining the Padres on an $8 million, two-year deal, said otherwise.	"That was for my teammates," Kinsler said after the 4-3 victory Thursday night. "It had nothing to do with the fans. It's for my teammates. It's an inside thing with them. Just trying to get everybody fired up. We had a tough road trip. I'm a passionate player. I try to get my teammates going. That was it."	He declined to say exactly what he said.	"That's why it's inside," he said. "We need the fans behind us. We need the city of San Diego to be passionate with us and on our side. Hopefully that's the way they see this team."	Kinsler's homer and reaction overshadowed the Padres setting the major league record by going 8,020 games without a no-hitter since their inception. Then again, fans have been used to that since 1969.	Franmil Reyes also homered, connecting off San Diegan Trevor Williams an inning before the Pirates starter left because of discomfort in his right side.	Green had a different take than Kinsler.	"I think we're aware of what's going on," the manager said. "I understand the emotion of the game a little bit, the frustration he's felt up to this point. I'm not excusing anything by any stretch, but understanding what it feels like to go to the plate every day and grind and struggle. The world we live in, you hear a lot of hostility, so some of that comes out at times."	Green said the Padres have an "outstanding" fan base, and that fans have the right to express displeasure.	"We as professionals should handle that displeasure in a more positive way than it was handled today," Green said. "With him, he knows that. He's played the game a long time. ... Clearly not expressed well today. Ultimately, though, he's a passionate baseball player."	Green said he'd talk with Kinsler about it.	Kinsler's three-run shot off Richard Rodriguez (0-3) with two outs in the sixth gave the Padres a 4-2 lead and got them off the hook for some shoddy play. It was Kinsler's fifth.	Gregory Polanco made it a one-run game with a homer to right in the seventh, his third.	Adam Frazier singled to left off lefty Eric Lauer with two outs in the third to extend the Padres' streak of futility into record territory. The Padres remain the only major league team without a no-hitter. The previous longest streak of 8,019 games without a no-hitter from a franchise's inception was by the New York Mets, who got their first no-hitter, by Johan Santana, on June 1, 2012.	"It was still kind of early in the game," Frazier said. "It's pretty cool to extend that streak. I didn't know about it; just trying to get a hit. I'm glad we weren't the team that let them break that record, or whatever you want to call it."	The Padres have had pitchers take no-hitters into the eighth inning or beyond several times since their expansion season of 1969 but have never completed one. Some fans feel the franchise is cursed because manger Preston Gomez lifted Clay Kirby after eight no-hit innings against the New York Mets on June 21, 1970.	"It's not a record that we want. I think one's coming soon," Lauer said.	Adam Warren (3-1) pitched two-thirds of an inning for the win, and Kirby Yates pitched the ninth for his major league-leading 17th save.	Reyes homered into the Padres' bullpen beyond the fence in left-center with one out in the third, his 13th.	The Pirates tied it in the fifth after the Padres gave them several extra chances, including when rookie Kevin Newman, who played locally at Poway High, doubled to shallow right on a ball that ticked off Kinsler's glove as the second baseman tried to make a basket catch while right fielder Reyes and first baseman Eric Hosmer also converged on the ball. Newman went on to score on Frazier's soft chopper to the right of the mound, beating Lauer's throw home.	The Pirates went ahead 2-1 on an unearned run in the sixth on two singles, an error and a wild pitch.	Williams, who played at nearby Rancho Bernardo High, left with two outs in the fourth after striking out Myers. He gave up one run and two hits, struck out five and walked one.	Williams loaded the bases with one out in the first on a walk, single and hit batter before striking out Alex Dickerson, who also played at Poway High, and getting Myers to ground out.	"I think it's hard to evaluate the outing. He was competing like he always does. He was going out there, making pitches," manager Clint Hurdle said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: Green said "it'd probably still be a little bit of a stretch" to expect rookie SS Fernando Tatis Jr., on the IL because of a strained left hamstring, to return to the team before the end of this seven-game homestand. Green said Tatis, who was hurt on April 28, still isn't running at 100 percent.	UP NEXT	Pirates: RHP Jordan Lyles (3-1, 2.09 ERA), who pitched with San Diego for parts of the 2017 and 2018 seasons, is scheduled to start Friday night.	Padres: LHP Joey Lucchesi (3-2, 4.57) held the Pirates to one hit in five innings in a 4-3 victory at Petco Park on June 30.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

NEW YORK -- CC Sabathia shouted salty insults at the Tampa Bay Rays and said he tried to hit one of their batters.	A little while later, it was Gio Urshela who had the last word for the New York Yankees.	Urshela's single capped a three-run rally in the bottom of the ninth inning, and the surging Yankees leapfrogged Tampa Bay into first place in the AL East with a rousing 4-3 victory Friday night.	"When Gio came up, I said: 'Turn off the lights,'" Sabathia recalled.	Urshela, subbing spectacularly for injured third baseman Miguel Andujar, sent a two-out drive over Kevin Kiermaier's head in deep right-center field for his first walk-off hit.	"The kid's just been unbelievable, and every time there's a big situation, he always comes through," teammate Luke Voit said.	"He's been the energy of this team so far," Sabathia said.	Voit homered on the first pitch from Jose Alvarado (0-3) to make it 3-2. New York tied it when pinch-runner Thairo Estrada scored on a bases-loaded wild pitch by Alvarado, who entered with a 1.04 ERA.	Urshela and Voit had three hits apiece. Kendrys Morales clubbed an early solo shot for his first home run since joining the Yankees on Wednesday following a trade from Oakland.	Willy Adames homered off Sabathia, who pitched six strong innings, and rookie Brandon Lowe hit a tiebreaking double against Chad Green with two outs in the eighth. Tampa Bay added another run on shortstop Gleyber Torres' throwing error before rain caused a 35-minute delay in the bottom of the inning.	Torres doubled on the 10th pitch of his at-bat in the ninth to put runners at second and third with one out.	"There's no excuse for what happened," Alvarado said through a translator. "They must have been sitting on my fastball."	Jonathan Holder (3-1) struck out two in a perfect inning.	With their fourth straight victory and ninth in 11 games, the injury-ravaged Yankees took over the division lead for the first time since a March 30 loss.	"Night in and night out, I mean, it gets better and better. It's crazy," Voit said.	Tampa Bay had been alone in first place since the end of games on March 31.	The unfriendly rivals play twice more this weekend after New York took two of three from the Rays last weekend at Tropicana Field.	"Anytime you get walked off, it's tough," Rays manager Kevin Cash said. "We did a lot of things good. We just came up short."	Sabathia threw three inside pitches to Austin Meadows, including one right near the knees, before walking him with two outs and nobody on in the fifth. As he was coming off the field, a camera caught Sabathia appearing to tell teammates he "was definitely trying to hit" Meadows.	"I really didn't think anything of it, honestly," Meadows said. "He didn't hit me. So all good there."	After striking out Lowe with his final pitch in the sixth, the big lefty cursed and yelled a nasty phrase in the Rays' direction.	"I don't remember what I said," Sabathia answered. "Just excited about the game. We are playing for first place."	The 38-year-old Sabathia got into heated exchanges with the Rays the previous two times he faced them -- once last year, once this season -- when he grew angry over pitches that either hit or went behind New York batters.	In his final start last season, Sabathia was ejected at Tropicana Field and handed a five-game suspension for plunking Jesus Sucre after Andrew Kittredge of the Rays threw behind Austin Romine.	"CC's always got a little bit of an edge," Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. "He went out and set the tone really well to start off this series."	Despite the latest verbal antics by Sabathia, who plans to retire after this season, there was no trouble on the field.	"You know CC, he's been around a long time. He's a competitor," Meadows said. "He obviously wanted to take a shot there, but it is what it is, obviously. We've had beef back and forth, so it is part of the game."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: Yandy Diaz was back in the lineup at first base after leaving Wednesday's game in Miami with a sore left ankle. ... Guillermo Heredia (bruised right hand) started in center field. He was hit by a pitch Wednesday, but X-rays were negative. ... C Anthony Bemboom, who sprained his left knee Wednesday, was placed on the 10-day injured list and is expected to miss four to six weeks, Cash said. That opened a 25-man roster spot for catcher Erik Kratz, acquired Thursday from San Francisco. ... RHP Hunter Wood (sore right shoulder) struck out three in one inning of a rehab outing Thursday for Class A Charlotte and is "real close" to returning, Cash said.	Yankees: LHP James Paxton (left knee inflammation) won't come off the injured list in time to start Sunday's series finale, Boone said. He is expected to throw another bullpen in the next few days and could return to the rotation on the upcoming road trip next week.	UP NEXT	A rematch Saturday afternoon between 2018 AL Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell (3-4, 3.56 ERA) and Yankees RHP Masahiro Tanaka (3-3, 3.44). Snell struck out 12 over 5 2/3 innings last Sunday at Tropicana Field but lost 7-1 to Tanaka, who went seven innings.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PHILADELPHIA --  Andrew McCutchen's early batting practice quickly paid off.	McCutchen hit a two-run homer, Bryce Harper lined a two-run double and Cole Irvin tossed six effective innings to lead the Philadelphia Phillies past the Colorado Rockies 5-4 Friday night.	Phillies manager Gabe Kapler praised McCutchen before the game after seeing him work on hitting slow curves hours before the first pitch.	"It's really gratifying," Kapler said after McCutchen got immediate results.	McCutchen also drew two walks, and the leftfielder threw a runner out trying to score.	"I felt pretty good, made some adjustments," McCutchen said. "I just try to stay in the zone and the hits will come."	The former NL MVP is batting .242 with six homers but has a .371 on-base percentage as a leadoff hitter in his first season in Philadelphia.	Irvin (2-0) gave up four runs -- three earned -- and five hits to win his second career start. Jose Alvarez and Pat Neshek each tossed a scoreless inning and Hector Neris finished for his sixth save in six tries.	Ian Desmond ripped a two-run homer for Colorado. Rockies starter Jon Gray (3-4) allowed five runs and five hits in 4 2/3 innings.	"Jon worked awful hard in the third and fourth innings," Rockies manager Bud Black said. "Some pitches on the edge could've changed the whole complexion of the game."	The NL East-leading Phillies snapped a three-game losing streak.	Cesar Hernandez followed J.T. Realmuto's two-out double with a double down the left-field line, giving the Phillies a 3-2 lead in the fourth.	Harper's double made it 5-2 in the fifth. Gray retired the first two batters before walking MuCutchen and allowing a single to Jean Segura.	Carlos Estevez replaced Gray and surrendered Harper's first RBI since he hit a grand slam on May 7. Harper had been 4 for 29 with 15 strikeouts before the hit. He heard boos after striking out in his first two at-bats.	"We're always going to keep battling," Harper said. "If one guy doesn't get it done, another will."	Desmond connected in the sixth to get the Rockies within a run but Philadelphia's bullpen preserved the lead.	Irvin helped himself at the plate by drawing a 10-pitch walk in his first big-league at-bat with two outs in the third. His first start came at Kansas City. McCutchen followed with a blast out to left-center to tie it at 2-2.	"That was awesome," Irvin said about fans rising for every pitch once he got to the sixth one. "A really cool, unique experience."	Irvin committed two fielding errors in the second and the Rockies took a 1-0 lead on Brendan Rodgers' fielder's choice grounder.	"Cole had every opportunity to unravel in the second but he has poise," Kapler said.	Charlie Blackmon led off the third with a double and scored on Mark Reynolds' double to make it 2-0.	DON'T YOU DARE	Rockies catcher Tony Wolters threw out two runners, McCutchen and Segura, trying to steal second base in the first inning.	ROSTER MOVES	Rodgers, the team's top prospect, was called up from Triple-A Albuquerque and played second base, batting seventh in his first game in the majors. The Rockies optioned right-hander DJ Johnson and infielder Pat Valaika to Albuquerque and activated left-hander Jake McGee from the 10-day injured list after he recovered from a sprained left knee.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rockies: LHP Chris Rusin (mid-back strain) is scheduled to throw two innings for Double-A Hartford on Saturday.	Phillies: INF/OF Scott Kingery (strained right hamstring) was 1 for 4 in a rehab game Friday at Double-A Reading. ... RHP Victor Arano (right elbow inflammation) threw a second bullpen session. ... RHP Vince Velasquez (right forearm strain) is expected in the next couple days.	UP NEXT	RHP Antonio Senzatela (3-2, 5.35 ERA) starts for the Rockies on Saturday and RHP Aaron Nola (3-0, 4.86) goes for the Phillies.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CLEVELAND --  The Indians treated their fans to a postgame fireworks display.	Dylan Bundy barely let them hear a pop.	Bundy kept Cleveland's lineup in check -- and in the ballpark -- for 5 2/3 innings and Jonathan Villar hit a three-run homer as the Baltimore Orioles ended a three-game slide Friday night with a 5-1 win.	Bundy (2-5) cooled off the Indians, who scored a season-high 14 runs in Thursday's series opener and had scored 23 times in the past two games. The right-hander, who has had a problem giving up home runs, threw mostly breaking pitches while not allowing an earned run and just three hits. He struck out seven and threw a season-high 118 pitches.	"Right from the first inning, I really felt good with my off-speed stuff and I was able to get it over," he said. "You're just trying to make your pitches and throw quality strikes."	Villar connected in the third inning off Jefry Rodriguez (1-3) and Stevie Wilkerson homered in the fifth to help the Orioles win for just the second time in nine games.	Wilkerson added an RBI double in the eighth, and the Orioles racked up a season-high seven extra-base hits -- two homers, five doubles.	Bundy improved to 4-1 in six career appearances against Cleveland. The 26-year-old had the Indians off-balance while managing to work around some trouble in the third, fifth and sixth innings.	After the Indians put two runners on with two outs on the sixth, he was replaced by Branden Kline, who retired Leonys Martin on a grounder. Shawn Armstrong and Mychal Given completed the combined three-hitter.	Baltimore manager Brandon Hyde didn't have his full complement of relievers after a doubleheader in New York on Wednesday and Thursday's blowout loss.	"Dylan Bundy set the tone with an amazing pitching performance," Hyde said, "just a quality performance on a night when we were so short in the bullpen."	Bundy's been dogged by a nasty habit of giving up home runs the past two seasons. He had allowed 11 coming in after being touched for an AL-high 41 homers last season.	But the Indians didn't put many good swings together and had a rough night after showing signs of emerging from an April-May slump. They never figured out Bundy, who came in with a 5.31 ERA -- just below Baltimore's MLB-worst 5.66 ERA.	"Coming into the game, his ERA wasn't good, but he'd been getting left-handers out," Indians manager Terry Francona said. "He continued that trend with a breaking ball, change-up, but he also got our righties out, speeding us up with the fastball and throwing breaking balls to them. He never really let us get comfortable."	Villar's fifth homer barely cleared the wall in right, but it went far enough to give the Orioles a 3-1 lead.	Rio Ruiz doubled leading off and Austin Wynns singled before Villar hit a 1-0 pitch from Rodriguez, who made his first career start against the Orioles while he was with the Washington Nationals last season.	POSITIVE NOTE	Francona was pleased with Rodriguez, who other than the two homers, pitched very well. The lanky right-hander allowed four runs and seven hits in 6 2/3 innings.	"I thought it was the best he's thrown, actually," Francona said. "He threw more breaking balls tonight by far than he has in any other outing. I just think he's fun to watch get better."	UP IN THE AIR	Orioles RHP Dan Straily, who hasn't pitched more than five innings in seven 2019 starts, isn't a lock to remain in the rotation. The 30-year-old allowed four runs in 3 1/3 innings Thursday against the Indians, raising his ERA to 8.51. "In Dan's case, we're going to explore all options," Hyde said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: C Robert Perez sustained a nasty bruise on the inside of his right knee when he got hit by a foul tip in the second inning of Thursday's win. Perez said his leg stiffened and he nearly came out. "I know there's a pad there, but he was hurting," Francona said. Kevin Plawecki was behind the plate Friday.	UP NEXT	Orioles: LHP John Means (5-3, 2.33) has won his last two starts, allowing just two runs and seven hits in 13 innings against the Red Sox and Angels.	Indians: RHP Adam Plutko will be recalled from Triple-A Columbus and make his season debut. He was optioned to the minors during training camp in March and then placed on the injured list with a forearm strain. Plutko was with Cleveland for six different stints last season.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

BOSTON --  The Houston Astros patiently waited out Rick Porcello through seven scoreless innings, then pounced when the Red Sox right-hander delivered a pair of mistakes.	Jake Marisnick led off the eighth with a double and George Springer drove the very next pitch from Porcello out for his AL-leading 17th homer as Houston won 3-1 on Friday night.	"Impressive win," Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. "Our pitching did really well to hang in there all the way to that last out. It was pretty exciting."	The Astros continued their torrid month of May with their ninth straight victory and got a perfect eighth inning from right-handed reliever Ryan Pressly, who set a record with his 39th consecutive scoreless appearance.	The Astros trailed Porcello and the Red Sox 1-0 entering the eighth, when Marisnick doubled to left on a 1-1 slider. Springer was ready when Porcello threw a high changeup, belting it over Boston's bullpen in right-center.	"We were on our game for seven innings and then I messed up on two pitches and they capitalized on it," Porcello said. "It's a heck of a job on their part and I've got to get better late in the game."	The Astros improved to 12-3 this month and matched the 2017 World Series championship team for the best start in franchise history at 30-15.	Will Harris (1-0) got the win with one scoreless inning of relief. Roberto Osuna picked up his 11th save, getting Mookie Betts to fly out to right with two runners on to end it. Boston went 1 for 11 with runners in scoring position and stranded 11.	Boston manager Alex Cora said it was his call to leave in Porcello, who had thrown 91 pitches through seven, and accepted the blame for the result.	"He doesn't deserve to lose that game," Cora said. "The way he moved the fastball, changed speeds, everything he did was outstanding. That's the best lineup in baseball and he went seven scoreless."	Houston won the opener of the three-game series between the last two World Series winners and a rematch of last year's ALCS, which Boston won in five games.	Christian Vazquez went 3 for 4 with a pair of doubles and an RBI for Boston, which entered the game second to only Houston for the best record in May at 10-3.	Porcello was replaced by Ryan Brasier, who allowed an unearned run after walking Michael Brantley and running into some defensive problems. Brantley took second on a passed ball and third on a wild pitch before scoring on Josh Reddick's sacrifice fly to right.	STILL SCORELESS	The Astros honored Pressly in the clubhouse with the ceremonial "player of the game robe."	Pressly helped himself with one of the top defensive plays of the night on a high chopper down the first-base line. Pressly was going full speed when he fielded the ball and threw it against his momentum, getting the ball to first baseman Yuli Gurriel in time without hitting Rafael Devers as he ran down the line.	The play ended the eighth and extended Pressly's string of scoreless innings, surpassing former Boston closer Craig Kimbrel, who had 38 in 2011 while with the Atlanta Braves.	"I just try to put it at the back of my mind as far as I possibly can. My job is to go out there and get people out and throw up zeroes as many times as I possibly can," Pressly said. "It's a big moment for me in my career. I couldn't be any happier than to spend it with these guys on this team."	STRONG STARTS	Porcello allowed two runs and six hits and a walk with three strikeouts.	Gerrit Cole pitched five scoreless innings for Houston, allowing six hits, walking one and striking out three. He was replaced by Hector Rondon, who allowed the game's first run after Xander Bogaerts led off with an in infield single and scored on a single by Vazquez.	Boston had been 0 for 9 with runners in scoring position before Vazquez came through and put Boston up 1-0.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: 2B Jose Altuve (strained left hamstring) is "pain-free" and could start some fielding work in the next few days, manager A.J. Hinch said. The Astros placed Altuve on the 10-day IL retroactive to Saturday. ... Aledmys Diaz started at 2B, but left in the middle of the second inning after running out an infield single. The Astros said Diaz had "left hamstring discomfort." He was replaced by Tony Kemp, who made a diving stop on a sharp grounder by Vazquez in the fourth and likely prevented a run from scoring.	Red Sox: 2B Dustin Pedroia (left knee) began a rehab assignment with Triple-A Pawtucket on Friday. Pedroia, who has been limited to nine games over the past two seasons because of the knee, played five innings and went 1 for 3. ... Boston placed C Sandy Leon on the paternity leave list Friday and recalled Oscar Hernandez from Pawtucket. ... RHP Chandler Shepherd was designated for assignment.	UP NEXT	Astros: RHP Corbin Martin (1-0) makes his second career start. Martin made his big league debut Sunday, striking out nine and allowing two runs on three hits and a walk in 5 1/3 innings against Texas.	Red Sox: RHP Hector Velazquez (1-2) was announced as Saturday's starter after the game.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

DETROIT --  Frankie Montas will have to wait to get his first major league complete game. That was about the only downside to his performance Friday night.	Montas pitched two-run ball into the ninth inning and the Oakland Athletics beat the Detroit Tigers for the 14th straight meeting with a 7-2 victory.	"Frankie begged me to let him pitch the ninth, and he deserved to get a chance," Oakland manager Bob Melvin said. "They only had two hits and he was under 100 pitches, so I told him I'd give him a shot on a short leash."	Montas (5-2) pitched a career-best 8 2/3 innings, allowing four hits while striking out a career-high ten. Lou Trivino relieved and got the final out after Montas allowed an RBI double to Miguel Cabrera.	"I wanted to finish the game, but I am very happy with how I pitched tonight," he said. "I just have to get one more out next time."	Montas had struck out seven batters on three occasions, including his last start, but overpowered the Tigers with movement and velocity. His fastball reached 98 mph to go along with a splitter and slider.	"He threw the ball great," Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire said. "We hit a few balls right at people, but he pretty much shut us down. He's got a variety of pitches with that little splitter, his slider and the fastball."	Chad Pinder and Mark Canha -- the sixth and eighth hitters in the lineup -- homered for the A's, and Khris Davis had three hits.	"It feels great to contribute to a win, especially at the bottom of the order," Pinder said. "I think we're starting to build some momentum."	Oakland's winning streak against Detroit is tied for the fifth-longest in franchise history, two short of a 16-game streak over the New York Yankees in 1989-91.	Daniel Norris (2-2) allowed six runs, seven hits and a walk in 5 1/3 innings.	Detroit has lost the first five games of a 10-game homestand and been outscored 48-11 in the process.	"My objective was to give us a chance to win and stop the bleeding," Norris said. "We have to find a way to win and not let these five games define our season."	The Tigers didn't get a baserunner until Cabrera's leadoff double in the fifth.	"We have a team picture tomorrow, so we're still alive," Gardenhire said. "We'll see how it goes, but I hope we'll be smiling."	The A's took a 1-0 lead in the fourth. Matt Chapman led off with a single, took second on Stephen Piscotty's base hit and moved up on Davis's fly ball to right. Oakland took advantage of Detroit's struggles turning double plays, as Matt Olson beat out shortstop Gordon Beckham's relay throw to get an RBI.	Canha made it 3-0 with a two-run homer in the fifth, but Josh Harrison's RBI double pulled the Tigers within two in the bottom of the inning.	The A's added three more runs in the sixth. Davis singled with one out in the sixth and scored when Olson's base hit to center skipped past JaCoby Jones for a two-base error. Pinder followed with a homer into the shrubbery beyond the center to make it 6-1.	Davis added an RBI single off Sandy Baez in the eighth.	Cabrera's ninth-inning double tied him with Lou Gehrig for 63rd place with 2,721 career hits.	"When he starts matching guys like Lou Gehrig, it tells you a little about his career," Gardenhire said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: RHP Jharel Cotton, who has been out since having Tommy John surgery in March 2018, was scheduled to start Friday night for Class A Stockton.	Tigers: 1B Niko Goodrum was a late scratch with flu-like symptoms. Beckham took his spot in the lineup, playing shortstop, while Ronny Rodriguez moved to first. ... Cabrera was the DH for the second straight day. He left Tuesday's game early with knee stiffness, then sat out Wednesday against Justin Verlander and the Astros.	THE LOSING CONTINUES	Detroit's 14-game skid against the A's is its longest against one team since dropping 14 straight to the Los Angeles Angels in 2002-03.	UP NEXT	The teams play the third of four games Saturday. Daniel Mengden (0-1, 6.75) starts for Oakland against Tigers lefty Matt Boyd (4-3, 3.15).	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

CINCINNATI --  The Dodgers' potent offense got rolling right away, leaving Rich Hill a chance to get a win. The left-hander dominated with a throwback effort.	Hill fanned 10 batters -- one shy of his career high -- while relying on his two best pitches, and Cody Bellinger hit the last of Los Angeles' four homers Friday night for a 6-0 victory over the Cincinnati Reds, the Dodgers' fourth in a row.	Hill (1-1) gave by far his best performance in four starts since returning from a sprained right knee. The left-hander allowed two hits and didn't walk a batter in six innings.	He fanned 10 for the first time since June 29 last year against Colorado.	"Richie had it going," manager Dave Roberts said. "It was fun to watch. Complete control tonight."	Hill had a couple extra days between starts this time and decided to go back to relying on his fastball and curve to get outs. It was an overwhelming combination against a Reds lineup that came in batting .219, second-worst in the NL behind Miami.	"I really went back to the drawing board and stuck to the fastball and curveball," said Hill, who threw 64 strikes in 84 pitches. "I threw everything downhill."	Hill also extended the Dodgers' stretch of solid starts. Since April 25, LA's rotation is 11-1 with a 2.19 ERA. The Dodgers have thrown five shutouts, second to the Cubs for the NL lead.	"Just continue to pass the torch, so to speak," Hill said.	Corey Seager, Joc Pederson and Max Muncy also homered at one of the Dodgers' most comfortable road stops. They're 34-22 at Great American Ball Park, the second-best mark by any NL team, trailing only the Mets' 32-19 record.	Bellinger also had a double, raising his batting average to .410.	The Reds couldn't overcome another subpar start by Anthony DeSclafani (2-2), who lasted only four innings for the second time in a row. He gave up four runs and six hits as the Dodgers repeatedly hit line drives. Only one of his outs came on a ground ball.	"Nothing was working," DeSclafani said. "It's pretty embarrassing for myself, to say the least. I've got to be better. I was lucky. They were crushing line drives right at people."	Cincinnati was blanked for the sixth time, second most in the majors. Only Miami is worse with nine shutouts.	Bellinger doubled and Seager homered in the second inning. Pederson hit his 14th homer leading off the third, and Muncy connected three pitches later for a 4-0 lead. Bellinger added his 16th homer, the second-most in the NL behind reigning MVP Christian Yelich.	DODGERS MOVES	Los Angeles recalled infielder Matt Beaty and selected the contract of outfielder Kyle Garlick from Triple-A Oklahoma City. Beaty went 2 for 3 with the Dodgers from April 30 to May 5. The 27-year-old Garlick would make his major league debut.	REDS MOVES	Infielder Josh VanMeter was optioned to Triple-A Louisville and reliever Cody Reed was recalled, giving the Reds another left-hander for the series.	QUOTE OF THE DAY	Garlick, on learning he was getting his first promotion to the major leagues: "I didn't know what to do. I was kind of in shock. ... I'm still kind of in disbelief."	DeSCLAFANI'S STRUGGLES	In his last two starts, DeSclafani has given up eight runs, 14 hits and four homers in eight innings. He fell to 1-5 career in six starts against the Dodgers.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: Kenta Maeda went on the 10-day injury list. He fouled a ball off his left thigh in his start Wednesday, a 2-0 win over the Padres . ... Justin Turner fouled a ball off his left shin in his second at-bat and left the game two innings later. X-rays were negative. He's expected to miss the second game in the series.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: Walker Bueheler (4-0) beat the Reds 3-2 on April 17 at Dodger Stadium, allowing one unearned run and three hits in 6 1/3 innings.	Reds: Tyler Mahle (0-5) gave up a career-high 11 hits and four runs in six innings of a 6-1 loss at Dodger Stadium on April 16.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

MIAMI --  Leaving the mound for the final time Friday night, Jacob deGrom broke into a jog as he reached the steps to the clubhouse and disappeared, eager to put the game behind him as quickly as possible.	The Miami Marlins scored for the first time in 27 innings, pounded deGrom for seven runs and snapped a seven-game losing streak by beating the New York Mets 8-6.	DeGrom (3-5) gave up nine hits, and the run total against him was a season high. The reigning NL Cy Young Award winner's ERA rose from 3.26 to 3.98.	"Tonight's on me. I did a terrible job out there," deGrom said. "I let it get out of hand."	It was too much for the Mets to overcome, even with two solo home runs by Pete Alonso , giving him 14 this year. J.D. Davis added his fourth homer for New York.	Trevor Richards (1-5) allowed three runs in 6 1/3 innings for his first victory in nine starts this year. Sergio Romo stranded two runners in the eighth and another in the ninth for the first two-inning save of his 658-game career.	"A pretty emotional win for us," Romo said. "We just beat one of the best pitchers in the world. That's pretty good."	Garrett Cooper's two-run single in the third brought home Miami's first runs since Saturday -- also against deGrom.	"We had a few games where we didn't score," Cooper said. "Just to help the team get going, it helped everybody. That's what I'm trying to do."	Jorge Alfaro hit a 456-foot home run , only the Marlins' second homer this month, and drove in three. Brian Anderson doubled twice and scored twice.	For deGrom, the performance was reminiscent of a rocky three-game stretch in April when he battled a sore elbow. In his three most recent outings he had allowed a total of only three runs, but he said he's still fighting inconsistency.	"I'm not being able to throw the ball where I want to right now," he said. "I wish I knew what it was. I'm trying to make the adjustment. If I knew, I'd probably fix it."	Manager Mickey Callaway said the problem is deGrom missing the target with his usually nasty slider.	"It's just not quite getting it there," Callaway said. "It's not quite spinning when he gets it there, and it's easier to hit."	Miami, shut out in the past two games, broke through in the third against the Mets ace. Miguel Rojas reached on third baseman Todd Frazier's error. A sacrifice, single and stolen base put runners at second and third, and Cooper singled for his first RBI of the year.	The Marlins added two more runs in the fourth on RBI singles by Alfaro and Rojas. Alfaro's two-run homer off deGrom in the fifth made it 7-1.	"To hit a homer against a really, really good pitcher," Alfaro said, "it feels good."	The Marlins ended a streak of seven consecutive losses to New York. Their 11 victories this year, fewest in the majors, include three wins against former Cy Young winners -- deGrom, Max Scherzer and Corey Kluber.	HE'S SORRY	The Mets' Robinson Cano jogged to first when he grounded into an inning-ending 1-6-3 double play in the seventh. He told Callaway he thought there were two out.	"The board said two outs," Callaway said. "He understands that no matter what the board says, you have to know how many outs there are. He came up to me proactively and apologized."	PROMOTED	New York right fielder Carlos Gomez, called up before the game from Triple-A Syracuse, went 0 for 3. The two-time All-Star last played for the Mets when he was a rookie in 2007.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: LF Jeff McNeil (abdomen) was held out of the starting lineup but struck out as a pinch-hitter in the eighth. ... LF Yoenis Cespedes (left and right heel surgeries) took batting practice and has started running.	Marlins: SS Rojas (back spasms) returned to the lineup.	UP NEXT	Mets: LHP Steven Matz (forearm irritation) is scheduled to pitch Saturday for the first time since May 3. He's 3-2 with a 3.86 ERA and beat Miami on April 1.	Marlins: RHP Pablo Lopez (2-5, 5.93) gave up a career-high 10 runs in his most recent outing, which came against the Mets on May 10. He lasted only three innings.	---	Follow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve-Wine	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ATLANTA --  The return of Ronald Acuna Jr. to the leadoff spot has helped to spark Atlanta's offense.	A barrage of home runs also makes a difference.	Max Fried allowed two hits in six scoreless innings, Dansby Swanson hit a drought-breaking, three-run homer and the Braves beat the Milwaukee Brewers 12-8 Friday night in a matchup of second-place teams.	Swanson, Josh Donaldson and Tyler Flowers hit home runs off right-hander Corbin Burnes in a nine-run sixth inning -- the most runs in an inning by the Braves in 10 years. Freddie Freeman homered and drove in two runs.	Acuna had three hits, drove in three runs and scored two runs. The Braves have averaged almost seven runs and are 6-1 since moving Acuna back to the leadoff spot, where he flourished in 2018 as a rookie.	"I think it allows speed to play a little bit more," Swanson said of the Braves' new lineup.	Acuna's hustle paid off in the first inning when he kept running for a double when Milwaukee's Lorenzo Cain had a lackadaisical approach to the ball in shallow center field. Acuna moved to third on Swanson's fly ball to right field and scored on Freeman's grounder to second base.	Fried (6-2) had five strikeouts and walked two batters against a Brewers offense that had scored a combined 22 runs in three straight wins over Philadelphia.	"That was a good test for him," said Braves manager Brian Snitker, who decided to pull the left-hander after he reached base twice in the long sixth inning.	Fried walked and doubled in the sixth. "I love it," he said when asked about his rare offensive highlight.	Burnes, who was removed from the rotation following early struggles, has allowed 14 homers in 27 1/3 innings.	"Poorly located fastballs are going to be a problem, yeah," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said.	"Tonight he did not throw the ball well, the first time in five or six outings. We've got to be better than that, there's no question about it. But we'll give him another chance, yeah."	The Braves led 12-0 before three relievers gave up eight runs in three innings.	Swanson ended a 0-for-17 slump with his homer into the left-field seats. Flowers' two-run shot knocked Burnes out of the game. Burnes allowed seven runs on five hits -- including three homers -- and two walks while recording only two outs.	Jacob Nottingham homered and drove in four runs for the Brewers, who began the night a half-game behind Chicago in the NL Central.	The Braves, chasing Philadelphia in the NL East, have won three straight.	Freeman's homer off Jhoulys Chacin in the third traveled 433 feet before hitting the front of a restaurant behind the first section of right-field seats.	Chacin (3-5) allowed three runs in five innings.	Atlanta led 12-0 before Josh Tomlin gave up four runs in two innings. Nottingham hit a two-run homer off Tomlin in the eighth.	Ryan Braun had a two-run single off Jonny Venters in the ninth, and Nottingham added a two-run single off Wes Parsons. Luke Jackson recorded the final out for his sixth save.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers RHP Jimmy Nelson (right shoulder) could be moving closer to his first start in the majors since Sept. 8, 2017. Nelson gave up three hits in 5 1/3 scoreless innings in a minor league rehab start for Triple-A San Antonio. He missed the 2018 season while recovering from shoulder surgery.	ROOKIE ON A ROLL	Braves rookie left fielder Austin Riley had two singles, giving him six hits in three games since he was called up from Triple-A Gwinnett. The six hits matches Milt Thompson (1984), Yunel Escobar (2007) and Acuna (2018) for Atlanta's best start through three games by a rookie.	PEREZ THE PITCHER	Hernan Perez, who started at third base, became Milwaukee's first position player to pitch this season. The scoreless eighth, despite two walks, was his fifth career appearance on the mound, including three in 2018.	BIG INNING	The nine-run sixth was the Braves' biggest inning since also scoring nine in the fourth against Colorado on May 20, 2009. The Braves sent 13 batters to the plate against Burnes and Jacob Barnes in the inning.	UP NEXT	Brewers: RHP Chase Anderson (right middle finger) is expected to come off the injured list to start Saturday night's game. Anderson (2-0, 3.20) was placed on the IL on May 1.	Braves: RHP Kevin Gausman (2-3, 4.50) allowed one run in eight innings in winning his only career start against the Brewers in 2018.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Adrian Sampson might not always have one-time Texas closer Jose Leclerc starting in front of him.	Worked pretty well this time, though.	Sampson got his first career win following Leclerc as the opener in his first major league start, Rougned Odor and Shin-Soo Choo homered in a seven-run second inning and the Rangers beat the St. Louis Cardinals 7-3 on Friday night.	"I'm not saying we are going to do it every time," manager Chris Woodward said. "But this team is so top heavy, their best hitters are at the top."	Leclerc struck out two in a perfect first inning. The right-hander was removed as the closer May 1 after two blown saves and twice being replaced in the ninth inning of games Texas went on to win.	Sampson (1-3) gave up seven hits and two runs -- one earned -- in 5 1/3 innings for the 27-year-old right-hander's first win in his 16th career appearance over three seasons, beginning with Seattle in 2016.	"It took me long enough, you know?" Sampson said. "I've just been through a lot, between getting called up and where I'm at now. Any time you pitch and it's been awhile, you start to think about it every inning. It was in my thoughts all the time. It's good to just get it out of the way."	Joey Gallo had both his hits in the highest-scoring inning this season for Texas, which beat the Cardinals in their first game in Arlington since losing Game 5 of the 2011 World Series.	Gallo also had a throw from center field clocked at 95.8 mph , according to MLB's Statcast, when he got Kolten Wong trying to go from first to third on Harrison Bader's single in the seventh inning.	Texas has won all seven regular season games against St. Louis since the dramatic World Series loss that included the Rangers being a strike away from the title twice in Game 6. The Cardinals rallied for an 11-inning victory and won going away in Game 7, both wins at home.	Miles Mikolas (4-4), facing his former team for the first time, gave up nine hits and seven runs in 1 1/3 innings, the shortest outing in 52 starts for the right-hander's career. The Cardinals dropped to 4-12 since May 1, when they had the best record in the majors.	"To throw up a stinker like this is frustrating but I'm not going to let this discourage me from all the good things that I had been doing," said Mikolas, who was coming off three straight strong starts before letting his ERA in his old home ballpark rise to 16.71.	Odor and Choo each hit a sixth home run this season -- Odor a three-run shot for a 4-0 lead and Choo a two-run homer for a 6-0 edge . Odor has three homers in two games.	Texas' big inning ended when Hunter Pence tried to score on a pitch that bounced and hit Yadier Molina in the mask. The catcher scrambled for the loose ball and dived back to the plate as Pence ran past without touching home. Molina made the tag before Pence got a hand on the plate.	After 13 Rangers batted in the second inning, four St. Louis relievers retired 18 of the final 20 Texas hitters with 10 strikeouts.	The first two runs for the Cardinals came home without a hit in the third. Bader scored when Odor mishandled Paul Goldschmidt's grounder, and Marcell Ozuna had an RBI fielder's choice. Bader hit a solo homer, his fourth of the season, with two outs in the ninth.	JUST ONE THROWBACK	Molina figures to be the only player to see action among those were part of the World Series eight years ago. Right-handers Lance Lynn of Texas, a rookie with the Cardinals back then, and Adam Wainwright of St. Louis won't start in the three-game series. Rangers shortstop Elvis Andrus is on the injured list with a strained right hamstring.	CHAMPION HURLER	Baylor women's basketball coach Kim Mulkey threw out the ceremonial first pitch a little less than six weeks after winning her third national championship with the Lady Bears. Mulkey, celebrating her 57th birthday, wore a white No. 19 Texas uniform top with "Mulkey" on the back.	Crouching behind home plate, third base coach Tony Beasley didn't even have to move his glove on the throw from the former point guard who won national titles as a player and assistant coach at Louisiana Tech. Baylor beat Notre Dame 82-81 for the title.	UP NEXT	Cardinals: RHP Dakota Hudson (2-3, 4.61 ERA) is set for his first start against an AL West team. Both of his previous appearances against American League clubs were in relief, against Kansas City and Detroit as a rookie last year.	Rangers: RHP Ariel Jurado (1-1, 1.50) is set for his first start of the season and ninth of his career. The first eight were last season.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

PHOENIX --  Arizona had good pitching, timely hitting and solid defense.	It's just the kind of game Torey Lovullo likes from the Diamondbacks, helping him become the second-fastest manager in team history to reach 200 wins.	Eduardo Escobar hit a three-run triple and David Peralta homered, lifting the Diamondbacks to a 7-0 win over the San Francisco Giants on Friday night.	"Two hundred wins is something I'm very proud of, but the players are more responsible for that than I am," Lovullo said.	Lovullo reached 200 wins in 369 games, behind only Bob Brenly, who did it 349 games.	The Diamondbacks used Lovullo's blueprint to get him to the milestone, getting good pitching early and building quality at-bats as the game progressed.	Peralta hit a solo homer off Jeff Samardzija (2-2) and Escobar cleared the bases with a slicing triple against Derek Holland in the seventh.	Adam Jones had a run-scoring double among his three hits and three relievers combined with Merrill Kelly (4-4) for Arizona's third shutout of the season.	"You look at that game and the story was we just couldn't get a big hit," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "We had runners out there we were just missing one more hit there to get things rolling and we just couldn't get it tonight."	Kelly worked around a high early pitch count in 5 1/3 scoreless innings after two shaky outings.	The right-hander allowed 10 combined earned runs his previous two outings, but was effective against the Giants until running into trouble in the sixth inning.	San Francisco loaded the bases to with one out to chase the right-hander, but Yoshihisa Hirano struck out Brandon Crawford and got Kevin Pillar to fly out to right.	Kelly allowed six hits and struck out four.	"He was using his defense," Jones said. "That's what we're there for and he was pounding the strike zone."	The first inning has been a struggle for Samardzija this season. He has a 12.38 ERA in the opening frame and allowed a majors-most six first-inning homers.	The right-hander made it through the first inning unscathed and held the Diamondbacks in check until Peralta lifted a solo homer to left-center in the fourth inning.	Jones chased Samardzija with a run-scoring double and Ketel Marte put Arizona up 3-0 with a broken-bat RBI single off Reyes Moronta.	Samardzija allowed three runs on five hits and walked three in 5 1/3 innings. He did not strike out a batter for the first time in 101 career starts.	"They are aggressive out there," Samardzija said. "I thought we were making good pitches, which kind of created the atmosphere that it did, just kind of moving along there."	BOCHY EJECTED	Bochy was ejected in the seventh inning for arguing a call after Jarod Dyson was hit on the hand attempting a bunt.	Bochy walked out of the dugout while trainers attended to Dyson and home plate umpire Andy Fletcher gave him an almost nonchalant ejection.	"They say he pulled back. He attempted to bunt the ball, not the right call there," Bochy said after his third ejection of his final season before retiring. "I don't know how much it played into the game, but the call was not right. He was attempting to bunt that ball."	TRAINER'S TABLE	Giants: C Buster Posey went 2 for 4 after being activated from the seven-day concussion list. He had been out since May 10, two days after taking a foul tip off the mask. ... 3B Evan Longoria was sick and out of the lineup.	Diamondbacks: RHP Zack Greinke will throw a bullpen session on Saturday after an MRI on Friday came back clean. He left Wednesday's start with abdominal tightness. The Diamondbacks will assess Greinke after his bullpen to determine whether he can start on Tuesday. ... RHP Taijuan Walker suffered a setback in his comeback from Tommy John surgery, suffering a right shoulder capsule sprain during rehab. He received an injection and will not throw for six weeks. ... Dyson remained in the game after being hit, but later came out. X-rays were negative and Lovullo said he should be available on Saturday.	UP NEXT	Giants LHP Madison Bumgarner, Saturday's starter against Arizona, went 1-1 with a 1.50 ERA against the Diamondbacks last season. RHP Zack Godley will make the start for the Diamondbacks after returning from the bullpen.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Matt Harvey seems to be finding his groove.	Harvey, who signed an $11 million, one-year deal with the Angels in the offseason, pitched two-run ball for five innings, and Mike Trout and Albert Pujols had two hits each as Los Angeles beat the Kansas City Royals 5-2 Friday night.	"The offspeed pitches were working well, and I could keep them off balance with the curveball," said Harvey, who has allowed two runs or fewer in four of his last five starts. "It was probably the best that's been all year. Pretty consistent in the zone and was able to bounce a few when I needed to. Working that in was definitely the key tonight."	The Angels opened a nine-game homestand with a win after dropping three of four.	The Royals have lost three in a row and five of six.	Harvey (2-3) retired eight of his first nine batters and didn't give up a hit until the third inning. He struck out six, allowed four hits and walked four in five-plus innings. He issued back-to-back walks to start the sixth, and his night was done.	The bullpen did its job, as four relievers combined for four scoreless innings.	Harvey faced runners on the corners after a two-out walk in the fourth but got Martin Maldonado to fly out to right field.	Hansel Robles earned his fifth save. He got hit on the inside of his left foot on a comebacker by Chris Owings to lead off the ninth. He was looked at by a trainer and manager Brad Ausmus but stayed in the game.	Pujols made a diving play at first base to get Owings out on a bang-bang play before he slid headfirst into first base.	Pujols passed Alex Rodriguez for 20th on the career hit list with 3,116.	Ryan O'Hearn hit a two-run single to left to pull the Royals within 4-2 in the sixth. The Royals had just six hits.	Kansas City had runners on the corners in the eighth inning against Cam Bedrosian after he got two outs to start the inning, but he got Maldonado to ground into a fielder's choice.	Royals starter Brad Keller (2-5) continued to struggle with command and walked three during a three-run second. Keller allowed four earned runs on seven hits and five walks in 5 2/3 innings.	"He wasn't yanking the ball as much," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "Really, with five walks in the game, he had a couple of 0-2 mistakes for base hits, but all in all I thought he did a good job limiting the damage."	SHO TIME	Shohei Ohtani received a hearty welcome for his first home appearance since returning following Tommy John surgery. He was 1 for 4 with two strikeouts.	SKIPPING A START	The Royals recalled RHP Heath Fillmyer from Triple-A Omaha and optioned INF Kelvin Gutierrez. Yost is using a four-man rotation, skipping Jorge Lopez's next start. With two off days next week, Yost said he wanted to keep starters on a five- or six-day rotation.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: OF Kole Calhoun was reinstated from the paternity list. His second child, daughter Knox, was born Wednesday and weighed 7 pounds, 11 ounces ... LHP Andrew Heaney (elbow) is expected to make his next rehab start Monday at Triple-A Salt Lake.	UP NEXT	Royals: RHP Jakob Janis (3-4, 5.77 ERA) is 0-2 with a 8.10 ERA in two career games against the Angels. He last pitched at Angel Stadium in 2017.	Angels: RHP Griffin Canning (1-1, 5.65 ERA) will make his fourth career major league start. He suffered his first loss in his last start Sunday in Baltimore after allowing four earned runs on five hits with four walks and six strikeouts in 4 2/3 innings.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

SAN DIEGO --  It's been nearly three years since the Pittsburgh Pirates have had a pitcher strike out 12 batters in a game.	That's how good Jordan Lyles was Friday night, when he dominated his former team for seven innings and helped the Pirates to a 5-3 victory against the San Diego Padres. Rookie Bryan Reynolds hit a go-ahead, two-run home run in the fourth.	"It was complete command from start to the end," manager Clint Hurdle said. "I think he retired nine guys on three pitches or less. It was just a really well-pitched game. He just continues to show us good stuff. He's building some street cred a lot of different places."	Lyles struck out a career-high 12 while walking one and allowing one run and five hits. He struck out the side in the seventh.	"We stepped it up in the seventh. We were hitting our spots really well," Lyles said. "We were on the same page and we were doing our thing."	Reynolds homered to right-center with one out in the fourth off left-hander Joey Lucchesi (3-3), his second, for a 2-1 lead. Josh Bell was aboard on a single.	"I knew I got it pretty well but I didn't know if it was going to get out," Reynolds said.	He said Lucchesi's fastball "was moving a lot. In my first at-bat he kind of showed me everything. Second at-bat I saw his changeup, curveball, whatever you want to call it. That let me get a good fastball to hit."	Lyles (4-1) allowed Franmil Reyes' 14th homer with one out in the first, and then didn't allow a baserunner past first until the sixth, when he got into and out of trouble. Manny Machado extended his hitting streak to 10 with a single to right with one out in the sixth and advanced to third on Eric Hosmer's hit-and-run single. But Lyles struck out Wil Myers and got rookie Ty France to fly out.	"You put yourself in a first-and-third situation, that's when you need to score, that's when you need to cash it in," San Diego manager Andy Green said. "That changes the trajectory of the ballgame."	Lyles pitched for the Padres for parts of the 2017 and 2018 seasons.	"We didn't have great at-bats against him," Green said. "It was good to see Franmil get one."	Lucchesi allowed two runs and five hits in seven innings, struck out six and walked two.	After Reynolds' homer, the Pirates added on with Melky Cabrera's two-run double in the eighth and RBI singles by Cole Tucker and Colin Moran in the ninth.	San Diego rookie Ty France hit a two-run homer in the ninth, his second.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: Placed RHP Trevor Williams on the 10-day injured list with a strain in his right side. Williams, who played at San Diego's Rancho Bernardo High, came out of Thursday night's game after just 3 2/3 innings. To take his roster spot, RHP Clay Holmes was recalled from Triple-A Indianapolis for his second stint with the Pirates this season.	UP NEXT	Pirates: RHP Montana DuRapau (0-0, 1.93) will be the opener Saturday night in his first big league start and fifth appearance. A 32nd round selection -- the 971st overall pick -- in the 2014 draft, he made his MLB debut on May 9.	Padres: Rookie LHP Nick Margevicius (2-4, 4.34) is scheduled to make his ninth big league start.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

SEATTLE --  In his first season with Minnesota, Martin Perez has rewritten the scouting report of his tendencies on the mound.	By doing so, he's become a challenge for batters to solve, especially for teams that saw plenty of Perez when he was with Texas.	The Seattle Mariners became the latest to struggle against Perez's new approach. The left-hander rebounded from his first loss of the season to overpower Seattle into the seventh inning, Max Kepler drove in three and the Twins beat the Mariners 7-1 Friday night for their fourth straight victory.	Perez (6-1) was knocked around for three earned runs and lasted just five innings in his last outing. But the lefty became the third Minnesota pitcher with six victories, joining Jose Berrios and Jake Odorizzi, as he worked free from a jam in the first inning and avoided trouble the rest of the way.	"I think I changed my plan when I go to the mound. That's all about it," Perez said. "The year before I just throw two-seam (fastballs) and down-and-away changeup. Now I've got my cutter in, I'm pounding in with my fastball and then come back with my changeup down-and-away. I think how I move the ball around the plate is good right now."	Perez allowed five hits and struck out seven while matching a season high with four walks over 6 2/3 innings. Seattle's run came when Edwin Encarnacion's two-out RBI single in the sixth inning barely cleared the glove of shortstop Jorge Polanco. The Mariners had a chance to get to Perez early but left runners at second and third in the first inning after consecutive strikeouts of Domingo Santana and Ryon Healy.	In his seven starts since joining the Twins rotation, Perez has a 2.01 ERA in 44 2/3 innings.	"It was a good consistent tight zone behind the plate and it forced Martin to keep the ball on the plate and I think he's capable of doing that," Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. "His ability to command all of his pitches, I consider him not just above average but exceptional in that regard. He'll be able to work under any circumstances that he has to and he was able to do that again tonight."	Seattle starter Marco Gonzales (5-3) lost his third straight decision. He retired the first seven before Ehire Adrianza's solo home run in the third inning. The Twins battered Gonzales for five runs and seven hits in the fourth and fifth innings. Kepler had the last of four straight hits in the fourth inning to drive in a run and added a two-out, two-run single in the fifth inning.	The five earned runs were a season-high allowed by Gonzales.	"We've got a long season to go. I don't think there's any panic, we have a lot of baseball to play," Gonzales said. "I'm not looking at April success versus May success, I'm looking at the next start and how I can get better."	DOUBLING UP	Encarnacion hit the 350th double of his career in the first inning, although the ground-rule double bouncing over the wall ended up costing Seattle a run. He joined Albert Pujols and Miguel Cabrera as only active players with at least 350 doubles and at least 350 home runs.	HOMER STREAK	Adrianza's home run extended Minnesota's streak of consecutive games with a homer to 12, its longest of the season. It's the longest streak for the Twins since homering in 16 straight games in September 2017.	ROSTER SHUFFLING	Seattle made a flurry of roster moves mostly to bolster arms in the bullpen. The Mariners recalled right-hander Matt Festa and selection righty Ryan Garton from Triple-A Tacoma. Starter Erik Swanson was optioned to Tacoma and left-handed specialist Zac Rosscup was designated for assignment. The move to option Swanson leaves a hole in Seattle's rotation, and manager Scott Servais was unsure whether it would be a bullpen day or if a starter would be called up from the minors the next time Swanson was scheduled to pitch.	Seattle also claimed RHP Andrew Moore off waivers from San Francisco and designated for assignment RHP Nick Rumbelow. Moore was assigned to Double-A Arkansas.	UP NEXT	Twins: Berrios (6-2) had a five-game win streak snapped in his last start against the Angels when he allowed a career-high 12 hits in 5 2/3 innings. Berrios is 1-2 in three career starts vs. Seattle.	Mariners: Wade LeBlanc (2-0) is expected to be activated off the injured list and make his first start in more than a month. LeBlanc suffered a strained oblique on April 12.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

NEW YORK --  Jose Alvarado stepped onto the Yankee Stadium mound, 18 hours after walking off with a look of disgust when he wasted a two-run, ninth-inning lead.	Luke Voit, whose home run started the previous night's meltdown, singled leading off the 11th.	Not this time.	Alvarado struck out Aaron Hicks and retired Gary Sanchez on a game-ending double play that gave Tampa Bay a 2-1 win Saturday and regained the AL East lead for the Rays. Alvarado slapped his glove and pitching hand together twice, raised both arms to the heavens and smacked his hands together again.	"He was ready. He was telling me before, `I want the ball. I want the ball. I want to come in. I want to respond from yesterday," said left fielder Austin Meadows, who threw out Aaron Hicks at the plate in the sixth, then homered off Luis Cessa (0-1) in the 11th,	Tampa Bay had been alone in first place for 47 straight days, the third-longest streak in team history, before New York scored three times in the ninth against Alvarado for a 4-3 win in the series opener and a half-game AL East lead.	AL Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell left trailing 1-0 after six innings, bouncing a run-scoring wild pitch in the third. Brandon Lowe tied the score in the seventh with a home run on the second pitch after Tommy Kahnle replaced Masahiro Tanaka, who was hit by a comebacker that left him with a bruised shin of uncertain severity.	Alvarado threw 26 pitches Friday and pitching coach Kyle Synder inquired Saturday about the availability of the closer, who turns 24 on Tuesday. Alvarado didn't hesitate.	Ready, he was.	Chad Roe, Adam Kolarek, Emilio Pagan and Hunter Wood (1-0) had followed Snell and combined for four innings of one-hit relief. While manager Kevin Cash wanted to avoid using Alvarado again, he called on him after Meadows' ninth homer this season.	"I won't say yesterday was easy," Alvarado explained through a translator, "it's part of the game."	Voit's leadoff hit in the 11th excited the crowd of a sun-splashed spring afternoon but did not faze Alvarado.	"To be able to bounce back, the guys, they showed each other something today," Cash said.	Hicks got ahead 3-1 in the count, fouled off a sinker and swung over a slider that probably would have been low for ball four.	"There was an opportunity there for a walk, and I definitely could have changed the outcome of the game," Hicks said.	Sanchez, who had struck out four times, fell behind 0-2 before hitting into a 5-4-3 double play and giving Alvarado got his fifth save in six chances.	"I had to just look at the situation, pay attention to the game, and be able to maintain my focus," Alvarado said.	Hicks tried to score from second on Gleyber Torres' two-out single in the sixth. Meadows charged and catcher Erik Kratz, making his first start for the Rays, snagged the slightly off-line, one-hop throw and tagged Hicks, who ran past third base coach Phil Nevin's stop sign.	"I was committed to going. I felt like I could make it, and I took my chance," Hicks said.	Tanaka outpitched Snell, the reigning AL Cy Young Award winner, for the second time in less than a week. Tanaka allowed three hits in six scoreless innings, struck out six and walked none.	Ji-Man Choi doubled with two outs on the sixth and Yandy Diaz followed with a hard grounder up the middle. The ball hit just above the pitcher's right ankle and ricocheted to Voit, who stepped on first. The Yankees said X-rays were negative.	"There's some swelling and some blueness to it," Tanaka said through a translator.	He doesn't know whether he will be able to take his next turn.	"We'll see how it is tomorrow and I guess we can evaluate from there," Tanaka said.	CC Sabathia had tried to hit Meadows three times Friday, a legacy of testiness from his previous two appearances against the Rays, Meadows was 0 for 4 Saturday when fouled off a slider from Cessa, stepped out, talked to himself and wagged his bat. Three pitches later, he drove a low, inside slider into the right-field seats, ending a streak of 13 straight outs for New York's bullpen.	"That was fun to be able to do that," Meadows said.	FULL/EMPTY	Hicks struck out in the third, dropping to 3 for 40 with the bases loaded. His first-inning single had ended an 0-for-8 slide that followed his return from a spring training back injury.	OPENERS	Sunday marks the first anniversary of the Rays using a relief pitcher as an opener in some games instead of a traditional starting pitcher, They are 40-29 in those games, 56-37 in others. "It can kind of set the tone a little bit, Cash said. "You're just not too accustomed to seeing a guy come in and throwing 98, 99 miles an hour right out of the gate and basically playing matchup baseball in the first two innings."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: Wood was activated from the injured list, and RHP Austin Pruitt was optioned to Durham (IL). ... INF Matt Duffy (left hamstring) was to play seven innings at shortstop rather than third for Class A Charlotte on Saturday night.

CHICAGO --  Lucas Giolito doesn't regard his victory as a complete game. After a long rain delay, five innings equaled nine -- at least in the record book.	Giolito struck out the side in the top of the fifth before play was halted because of rain, Leury Garcia homered and the Chicago White Sox beat the Toronto Blue Jays 4-1 Saturday.	"Everyone was joking about that, `Shower, complete game!" Giolito said. "I don't consider it a complete game until I get nine. But I went out there for the fifth and saw the rain coming down. I was like, `We've got to pick up the tempo a little bit,' and luckily we were able to get through five and close it out."	The game was called after a wait of three hours.	"The raindrops were so big that they were getting into my glove, on the ball, getting on my hand," said Giolito, who improved to 5-1. "So my approach was just to attack the strike zone with a fast pace and hopefully get a nice 1-2-3 inning, and that's what we did."	Yonder Alonso had two singles and two RBI for the White Sox, who have won five of seven.	Ryan Feierabend (0-1) allowed four runs and seven hits in four innings for Toronto in his first start in the majors since 2008. He struck out two and walked one. The Blue Jays have lost 10 of 13.	"Our offense is swinging the bats a lot better, so I think we still had a chance," Toronto manager Charlie Montoyo said. "Mother Nature says there's no way you can play."	Garcia homered to left field on Feierabend's second pitch for his second home run this season, and second career leadoff drive.	Freddy Galvis doubled down the right field line in the second inning, and a ball boy fell over while moving out of the way of the ball. Brandon Drury followed with a groundout to tie it at 1.	Alonso and Charlie Tilson singled to drive in two runs for a 3-1 lead in the bottom half. Alonso added another RBI single in the third.	The Blue Jays selected Feierabend's contract before the game from Triple-A Buffalo, where went 2-0 with a 2.70 ERA in three starts. He has pitched in Korea since last appearing in the majors in 2014 with the Texas Rangers. He entered with a career record of 2-11 with a 7.15 ERA and no road victories. The knuckleballer also throws a fastball and changeup.	Giolito gave up a run and three hits and was credited with his first career complete game. He struck out four and walked two. Giolito had allowed one earned run in his previous 16 2/3 innings.	"The maturation that he's shown, the ability to continue to repeat that delivery, thank goodness," manager Rick Renteria said.	WEATHER UPDATE	Rain soaked the field before the game was called.	"MLB waited as long as they could -- I appreciate that -- to give us a chance, but then it was not playable," Montoyo said. "There was nothing we could do about it."	A SMALL WORLD	In his last start, Feierabend pitched against the father of current teammate Vladimir Guerrero Jr. That's just one connection he has with former All-Stars and their offspring. Two others are in the Toronto farm system: the sons of Craig Biggio and Roger Clemens.	"It's kind of crazy," Feierabend said. "I actually had this conversation with the guys in spring training: Not only Guerrero, but I played against Cavan Biggio's dad and (Kacy) Clemens' dad at one point or another."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: RHP Javy Guerra (0-0, 3.86 ERA) was designated for assignment to make room for Feierabend. ... RHP Clay Buchholz (right shoulder inflammation) had an MRI on Saturday that showed a Grade 2 elbow strain. He will follow up with Dr. James Andrews on Monday for a second opinion, according to the team. ... RHP David Phelps, who had Tommy John surgery in March 2018, has thrown two live bullpens with no issue, the team said. He was scheduled to throw another live bullpen Saturday.	White Sox: LHP Carlos Rodon (3-2, 5.19) underwent successful Tommy John surgery on Wednesday. He is expected to return for the second half of next season. ... Renteria hopes OF Eloy Jimenez (right ankle sprain) will be ready to return from the injured list for the team's road trip that begins Monday at Houston.	UP NEXT	RHP Trent Thornton (1-4, 4.81 ERA) is expected to start for Toronto in the series finale. Thornton got his first major league victory after allowing two runs in 5 2/3 innings against San Francisco in his last start. RHP Reynaldo Lopez (3-4, 5.58) is scheduled for the White Sox. He has a 3.65 ERA in his last four starts.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Matt Carpenter almost homered and almost got picked off in the same decisive inning that pushed the St. Louis Cardinals to their first victory over Texas since the 2011 World Series.	Carpenter was initially given a two-run homer in the fifth inning after his opposite-field shot that hit the wide pad atop the 14-foot wall in left field, bounced up and came back down into the field of play. That was changed to an RBI double on replay review after the Rangers challenged the call, but still ignited a five-run outburst.	"That was big ... let's figure out a way, able to break through and have a big inning," manager Mike Shildt said. "It was a big hit, but more importantly we were able to do something with it."	Ariel Jurado (1-2) had Carpenter picked off after the overturned call in the fifth, but second baseman Rougned Odor dropped the ball for an error. The Rangers starter was done after walking the next batter.	Paul DeJong, who later homered and had a season-high four RBI, then greeted reliever Jeanmar Gomez with a two-run double into the left field corner that made it 4-0. After another walk, Jose Martinez had an RBI single and a groundout by Yadier Molina sent home another run.	"That's kind of our identity as an offense, be able to grind out at-bats, take advantage of the mistakes," DeJong said.	"Obviously, that fifth inning was the big one," Rangers manager Chris Woodward said. "We just couldn't seem to stop the bleeding. They hit a couple balls hard but also ground balls found holes. ... A little unfortunate."	DeJong drove in the first St. Louis run with a groundout in the third after a wild pitch and a throwing error by the Rangers. His solo homer in the ninth was his eighth of the season.	Cardinals rookie right-hander Dakota Hudson (3-3) struck out five and allowed two runs over six innings.	The Cardinals had lost seven regular season games in a row against Texas since their World Series title eight years ago, when DeJong was a freshman in college. They were swept in three-game home series in 2013 and 2016, and lost the opener of this series Friday night.	More recently, St. Louis had lost three in a row and 12 of 15 games this season after an 18-win April. The Rangers had scored 29 runs in a three-game winning streak.	Thunderstorms with heavy rain delayed the start of Saturday's scheduled midafternoon game by 2 hours, 11 minutes. There was no more rain until the game finished in a downpour that started when the Rangers were batting in the ninth.	Ronald Guzman led off the Rangers fifth with a single and scored on a double by Isiah Kiner-Falefa before he later came home on a groundout by Willie Calhoun , who has six RBI in four games since being called up by the Rangers earlier in the week.	"He's had really quality at-bats ever since he got here." Woodward said of Calhoun, who has hits in all four games.	LONG, LONG TIME	The series opener was the first regular-season game in Arlington for the Cardinals since June 13, 2004 -- a gap of 5,451 games. According to Elias, that had been the longest active gap in MLB, and the fifth-longest since interleague play began in 1997. ... The Cardinals still have more postseason wins (four) than regular-season wins (three) against Texas.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: SS Danny Santana was hit by a fastball on his right ankle when batting in the ninth inning. He was lifted for a pinch-runner before Guzman grounded into a game-ending double play. Woodward said X-rays were negative and that Santana has a bruised ankle.	UP NEXT	Cardinals: RHP Jack Flaherty (4-3, 4.34 ERA), the Cardinals' first-round draft pick in 2014, is 2-8 with a 4.94 ERA in 16 career starts when facing an opponent for the first time.	Rangers: LHP Drew Smyly (0-3, 6.85) is still looking for his first MLB win since 2016, before his Tommy John surgery in July 2017. He has never pitched against St. Louis.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

PHILADELPHIA --  Bryce Harper delivered a powerful swing and Aaron Nola provided the punchouts.	Harper homered over the batter's eye in center field, Nola tied his career high with 12 strikeouts while pitching into the seventh inning and the Philadelphia Phillies defeated the Colorado Rockies 2-1 on Saturday.	Harper also doubled for the NL East-leading Phillies. But it was his majestic drive in the first inning that had everyone talking.	"It looked like it went over the stadium," Nola said.	Harper crushed the first pitch he saw onto Ashburn Alley, a fan walkway where only a few home runs have reached since Citizens Bank Park opened in 2004. The drive, his eighth of the season, was estimated at 466 feet.	"You just stop and watch the distance of the ball," manager Gabe Kapler said. "That's rare territory."	Harper downplayed the length, happy enough to have cleared the fence.	"It's pretty cool, of course, but like (his former Washington Nationals manager) Matt Williams said, `It's not how far, it's how many," he said.	Harper's impressive blast helped Nola to an early cushion, and he took it from there.	Nola (4-0) allowed one run on eight hits while walking one. The right-hander looked more like the pitcher who finished third in the NL Cy Young voting last season and not the one who has struggled for much of 2019 -- he has a 4.47 ERA this year.	"It's what I remember when I was with the Nats (last season)," Harper said of Nola's performance.	While reaching double-digit strikeouts for the 10th time but first this season, Nola got past the fourth inning for seventh time in 10 starts.	"I felt pretty in control today, definitely smoother than previous starts," Nola said. "My command felt good and I was driving my fastball through the zone."	Tony Wolters had an RBI triple for Colorado, which has lost three straight.	"A little bit of lack of offense today," Rockies manager Bud Black said. "We had some chances, but didn't get the big hit."	Black also credited Nola.	"Best breaking ball he's had all year, I'm going to bet on that," Black said. "And his fastball had velocity, more than we've seen. It was evident of what we saw last year."	Nola breezed through six innings and Kapler elected to bring him out for the seventh despite 99 pitches. Wolters led off with a triple off the wall in right and pinch-hitter Ryan McMahon doubled off the wall in right-center to pull the Rockies within 2-1 and end Nola's day.	Adam Morgan got the first out on a grounder that moved McMahon to third before Seranthony Dominguez came on and wriggled out of the inning.	McMahon ran on contact with the Phillies' infield in on Trevor Story's groundball to third and was thrown out at home. A single by David Dahl and walk to Nolan Arenado loaded the bases for Daniel Murphy, who grounded out weakly to short.	Philadelphia went in front 2-0 in the third with the help of the Rockies. Jean Segura walked, went to third on Rhys Hoskins' single that was booted in left by Raimel Tapia and scored on a wild pitch by Antonio Senzatela (3-3).	Senzatela gave up five hits and four walks in five innings.	NOTHING FROM NERIS	Hector Neris retired six straight batters in the final two innings for his seventh save in as many chances.	Kapler rarely brings Neris out for a second inning, but felt the Phillies' de-facto closer had the stuff to pull it off.	"When he looks as good as he did, sometimes you have to push; he responded," Kapler said.	FIRST FOR RODGERS	Brendan Rodgers, Colorado's top prospect playing in his second game, got his first hit with an infield single in the second. Rodgers went 1 for 4 with three strikeouts.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: INF/OF Scott Kingery (strained right hamstring) played for Double-A Reading in a rehab outing on Saturday and is nearing a return. He went 0-for-3 with a sacrifice fly and a strikeout.	UP NEXT	The teams wrap up their three-game series on Sunday with Philadelphia RHP Jerad Eickhoff (2-2, 2.65) facing LHP Kyle Freeland (2-5, 5.68).	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

CLEVELAND --  Adam Plutko's season debut for Cleveland couldn't have gone much better.	Called up from Triple-A Columbus before the game, Plutko allowed one run in six innings -- a solo homer by Trey Mancini for Baltimore's only hit -- and the Indians defeated the Orioles 4-1 on Saturday.	Plutko was optioned to the minors at the end of spring training and didn't pitch in April because of a strained right forearm. He made two starts in Columbus before being rejoining the Indians.	"It's always exciting to be out there on a major league mound, whether it's your first time back in a while or your 12th consecutive game out there," Plutko said.	Plutko gave up the home run to Mancini with two outs in the fourth. The right-hander struck out four, walked two and was pulled after throwing 83 pitches.	"He knows how to pitch," Mancini said. "I've been facing him since we were in college in 2013. It was especially impressive, being his first game off the DL."	Plutko was 4-5 in 17 appearances with the Indians last season and will be counted on to help Cleveland's injury-depleted rotation.	"I do feel like I belong here, but at the end of the day it's one outing," he said. "If you're a starter in the big leagues you need to be good 34 times (a season), not just one."	Corey Kluber broke his right arm after being hit by a line drive in April and will be re-evaluated later this month while Mike Clevinger strained an upper back muscle in the second week of the season.	Cleveland used three relievers to finish it. Oliver Perez struck out three of the four hitters he faced. Adam Cimber retired a batter in the eighth, but a fielding error by third baseman Jose Ramirez and a walk put two runners on.	Brad Hand struck out Jonathan Villar to end the inning and worked a perfect ninth for his 12th save in 12 chances.	Baltimore managed four baserunners on three walks and Ramirez's error.	Jordan Luplow and Carlos Santana homered for Cleveland, extending Baltimore's major-league-leading total of home runs allowed to 93.	Luplow hit a two-run homer in the fourth off John Means (5-4). The blast followed Santana's double for Cleveland's first hit. Luplow, batting cleanup for the second time this season, has five home runs -- all since May 9.	Santana hit a leadoff homer in the eighth off Miguel Castro.	Mancini drove a 1-0 pitch to the porch in left field for his team-leading 10th home run of the season and second in the series.	The Indians were batting .223 at gametime and were held to three hits by Baltimore on Friday in a 5-1 loss. Cleveland rolled to a 14-7 win in the series opener Thursday and scored nine runs against the Chicago White Sox on Tuesday.	BIG DAY	Outfielder Oscar Mercado, called up from Columbus on Wednesday, doubled in the fifth for his first major league hit. The rookie will give the baseball to his parents, who attended the game.	"The first thing I did was look over to where they were sitting," Mercado said. "They were cheering pretty loud. You could tell they were excited."	Mercado said he used one of Jose Ramirez's bats to get the hit. Ramirez, who has struggled all season and is batting .193, singled in the eighth.	Mercado's teammates gave him a shower consisting of various liquids following the game. Veteran reliever Tyler Clippard was also doused after officially reaching 10 seasons in the majors Saturday.	LOOKED GOOD EARLY	Means retired nine of the first 10 hitters before running into trouble in the fourth. The rookie left-hander, who allowed three runs and five hits in five innings, won four of his previous five starts.	"My fastball felt good," Means said. "I just didn't have my secondary pitches today. I was nibbling and they weren't swinging at bad pitches. That was really frustrating."	UP NEXT	Orioles: RHP Yefry Ramirez (0-1, 5.14 ERA) moves into the rotation after making his first three 2019 appearances in relief.	Indians: RHP Shane Bieber (2-2, 3.81 ERA) seeks his first home win of the year. He is 0-1 with a 4.43 ERA in four starts at Progressive Field.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

DETROIT --  Once he made it through the first inning, it was smooth sailing for Daniel Mengden.	Mengden pitched seven impressive innings and Nick Hundley and Chad Pinder homered to lift the Oakland Athletics to their 15th straight win over Detroit, 4-1 on Saturday. If the A's beat the Tigers on Sunday, they would tie a franchise record for their longest winning streak against one team. Oakland won 16 in a row over the New York Yankees from 1989-91.	Mengden (1-1) allowed a run and three hits. He walked Nicholas Castellanos and Miguel Cabrera in the first but got out of that jam. Those were the only free passes he issued all day.	"Those two walks I had -- Miguel Cabrera and Castellanos are the two best hitters, so I was trying to make good pitches to them," said Mengden, who struck out five. "Besides that, it was all about getting strike one, being the aggressor."	Lou Trivino worked the eighth inning for Oakland, and Blake Treinen pitched the ninth for his seventh save in nine chances.	Matthew Boyd (4-4) allowed four runs in 6 1/3 innings for the Tigers, who have dropped six straight. Boyd struck out eight.	Making his 100th career appearance, Boyd retired his first seven batters before allowing a single to Jurickson Profar, the first of three hits for the Oakland infielder. Hundley followed with his first home run of the season, which barely cleared the wall in right field.	"You never know what run is going to win or lose you a ballgame," Boyd said. "You really can't put much thought into what's going on with the offense. You want to throw zeros as often as you can."	The only run for Detroit came in the fourth, when -- with two outs and two strikes -- Mengden threw a wild pitch that enabled Ronny Rodriguez to score from third.	Profar hit an RBI double in the fifth to make it 3-1, and Pinder added a solo homer in the seventh.	Mengden allowed 15 of his 58 runs in the first inning last season, and he yielded two runs in the first inning of his previous start. This time, he worked through those two early walks.	"When he came back after the first inning, understood he's got to throw strikes," A's manager Bob Melvin said. "He's got good stuff, he can mix his pitches really well. He's a true four-pitch guy."	MILESTONE	The Tigers have not had the lead at any point during this losing streak. They did have a nice moment Saturday, when Cabrera singled in the ninth, breaking a tie with Lou Gehrig for 63rd place on the career hits list. Cabrera, who now has 2,722, was removed for a pinch runner and got a warm ovation from the crowd.	"I can accept that game -- not the loss, but I can accept that game," Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire said. "The intensity, the way we played. We were into it, really into it. They were getting after it and they had confidence. We have to keep playing like that and good things will happen."	SPLITS	The A's improved to 10-5 when an opponent starts a left-handed pitcher this year. They are 12-20 when facing righties.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: Khris Davis had the day off. The Oakland slugger returned last weekend from a bruised left hip. He'd played in five straight games since then.	Tigers: Niko Goodrum, who was scratched Friday with flu-like symptoms, was out of the lineup again.	UP NEXT	Athletics: Oakland goes for the four-game sweep Sunday, with Mike Fiers (3-3) on the mound. Fiers spent much of 2018 with Detroit before being traded to the A's in August.	Tigers: Gregory Soto (0-2) starts for Detroit.	---	Follow Noah Trister at www.Twitter.com/noahtrister	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

CINCINNATI --  The Reds ended LA's streak of shutdown pitching with a little of their own, led by a starter who had yet to get a win.	Jesse Winker's homer ended LA's stretch of scoreless pitching, and Yasiel Puig singled home a pair of runs against his former team Saturday, leading the Cincinnati Reds to a 4-0 victory that snapped the Dodgers' four-game winning streak.	The Reds beat the Dodgers for the first time in five games this season, including LA's three-game sweep in April. The Dodgers are 34-23 at Great American Ball Park, the second-best mark by an NL team behind the Mets.	Tyler Mahle (1-5) got his first win in his ninth start, allowing four singles and a pair of walks in five innings. Mahle showed significant improvement over his April 16 start at Dodger Stadium, where he gave up a career-high 11 hits in a 6-1 loss.	"You can't say enough about Mahle," manager David Bell said. "The way he prepared against that great lineup was really impressive."	The Dodgers got a base runner in each of the first five innings Saturday but Mahle escaped a pair of scoring threats.	Three relievers completed the Reds' sixth shutout victory, tied with the Cubs for most in the NL. The Dodgers were blanked for the fourth time.	It was the Reds' first shutout win over the Dodgers since a 5-0 victory at Great American on June 11, 2014.	"We didn't have a lot of good swings against him," manager Dave Roberts said.	Winker's solo homer in the second inning off Walker Buehler (4-1) ended the Dodgers' streak of 23 scoreless innings. They were coming off back-to-back shutout wins. Puig singled home a pair of runs in the third after a throwing error by shortstop Corey Seager set up a rally.	Puig's sinking liner to center landed before Alex Verdugo could get to it. The Reds wound up with three unearned runs out of the inning.	"Puig didn't hit it hard enough to get it to our guy," Buehler said. "It's frustrating when that happens."	It was Puig's first hit since a bases-loaded single in the 10th inning gave the Reds a 6-5 win over the Cubs on Wednesday.	"I was only happy to get a hit," Puig said. "The night before, I did nothing. I finally got a hit, and that made me feel better."	Cody Bellinger had a pair of singles, leaving his batting average at .409. He fouled a ball off his right foot in his final at-bat but stayed in the game and singled.	REDS MOVE	Outfielder Phillip Ervin was recalled from Triple-A Louisville and left-handed reliever Cody Reed was optioned. Reed was called up Friday and pitched two innings in LA's 6-0 win.	HOMECOMING	Buehler grew up in Lexington, Kentucky, about an hour south, and attended games at Great American Ball Park. Between 30-40 relatives and friends were in the stands Saturday for his first career appearance at Great American, which was a notable personal moment as well.	"I've been to a few games here and grew up a Reds fan," he said. "It's probably a little more special, a little different than other places."	FINALLY A HIT	Tucker Barnhart singled in his first at-bat, ending a 0-for-13 slump. Barnhart has two hits in his last 29 at-bats and three in his last 41.	VOTTO'S STREAK	Joey Votto went 0 for 3 with a walk, ending his season-best hitting streak at six games. Votto is 10 for 62 (.161) in May with three RBI.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: Justin Turner was better a day after he fouled a ball off his left shin and left the game. He was out of the lineup, but pinch hit in the ninth and made the final out by hitting into a force play. Roberts planned to wait and see how Turner felt Sunday morning before deciding whether to put him back into the lineup.	Reds: Infielder Alex Blandino is close to starting a rehabilitation assignment in the minors. He tore ligaments while turning a double play last July and had reconstructive surgery.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: Hyun-Jin Ryu (5-1) allowed only one hit in eight innings of a 6-0 win over Washington last Sunday. He leads the majors in strikeout-to-walk ratio.	Reds: Tanner Roark (3-2) has allowed only two homers in 46 1/3 innings. He's 0-2 with a 3.63 ERA in four career starts against the Dodgers.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

MIAMI --  Miami Marlins starter Pablo Lopez followed his worst outing as a big leaguer with his best -- both against the New York Mets.	The result was the Marlins' first winning streak in nearly a month, and ramped-up speculation that Mets manager Mickey Callaway's job was in jeopardy.	"I'm coming in tomorrow to manage the New York Mets and I'm going to be enthusiastic about it and I'm going to continue to lead this team to something special," Callaway said after his team was held to one hit Saturday in a 2-0 loss.	Lopez gave up a double on his first pitch, then combined with the Marlins' bullpen to hold the Mets hitless the rest of the way in sending New York to its fourth straight loss.	"I didn't even have to talk," Marlins manager Don Mattingly said. "He was really good."	Lopez (3-5) pitched seven innings and tied a career high with seven strikeouts. It was bounce-back performance for the 23-year-old righty after allowing a career-high 10 runs in three innings in his last start on May 10 in New York.	"You find out what a guy is made of," Mattingly said. "He took a beating in New York. Nothing went right. There were two ways to go -- either he was going to come out and pitch as if he were afraid of those guys or he was going to be aggressive."	Lopez patiently awaited his next opportunity.	"Last outing was rough and I had to wait eight days for today," he said. "So I was a little anxious to go out there and leave everything on the field."	The Marlins, with the worst record in the majors, beat the Mets for the second straight day after entering the series with a seven-game losing streak.	The Mets fell a season-worst four games under .500.	"I do believe we have talent in there," Callaway said. "We haven't played like that. There's no doubt that hasn't been the case, but I believe those things for a reason and I believe everyone comes to the park every day for something greater than what's been happening. We have to start making it happen, somehow, some way."	Callaway is in his second year with the Mets, who made lots of changes in the offseason.	"As a leader you can't ever worry about yourself," Callaway said. "I'm here. One of the things I told them when I got hired was selfless service is very important to me and my goal every day is to improve that room, be consistent, and make sure our players continue to improve."	Mets veteran third baseman Todd Frazier defended his manager.	"It's not a question for me, I think he's doing a great job," Frazier said. "He can't go up there and hit. He makes the lineup, he puts the guys in at the right time, and we're not producing."	Jeff McNeil sliced the first pitch of the game just inside the left field line for a double, but that was all the Mets managed against Lopez (3-5) and two relievers.	A crowd of 13,474 saw the Marlins record their first one-hit shutout since four pitchers combined to throw one on May 7, 2017, against the Mets in New York.	"(Lopez) threw mistakes and we missed them," Callaway said. "We didn't the other day. It's not like he made every pitch all night."	Tayron Guerrero got four outs and Adam Conley finished for his second save.	Jon Berti hit his second home run of the season and Brian Anderson knocked in the other run for the Marlins, who won consecutive games for the first time since back-to-back wins over the Washington Nationals on April 19-20.	"To put another on the board hopefully it gives us momentum," Mattingly said.	Steven Matz (3-3) was activated from the 10-day injured list to make his first start since May 3 at Milwaukee. He allowed two runs and five hits in 3 2/3 innings. He struck out six and walked two.	"It was OK," Matz said. "A little erratic with the fastball in the zone. I haven't been out there in a while so I was trying to figure out that adrenaline a little bit again. It was a loss, wasn't very efficient, got out of there in the fourth inning so really not that great."	Berti led off the bottom of the first with a home run to right off Matz, who entered with a 3-0 record and 0.93 ERA in five career starts at Marlins Park.	Anderson's single in the third gave Miami a 2-0 lead.	The Mets bounced into inning-ending double plays in the sixth and eighth.	SEWALD TO MINORS	Right-handed pitcher Paul Sewald was optioned to Triple-A Syracuse to make room for Matz. Sewald has a 3.86 ERA in four appearances with the Mets.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: LHP Jason Vargas (hamstring) is scheduled to make a rehab start on Sunday with Double-A Binghamton and then could return to the Mets if all goes well. "We'll see, but I think he would be an option after one (rehab start)," Callaway said.	Marlins: C Jorge Alfaro left the game in the fourth inning with a mild left calf strain after sliding into second base for his first stolen base of the season. He is considered day-to-day. "I'm fine," Alfaro said. "It feels bruised right now, bothering me a bit. I'll be back Tuesday."	UP NEXT	Mets: RHP Noah Syndergaard (3-3, 4.74 ERA) tossed his second career complete game and first shutout of his career in his last start against the Marlins on Sept. 30, 2018.	Marlins: RHP Sandy Alcantara (1-4, 5.11) is 1-2 with a 2.92 ERA in four career starts against the Mets.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

WASHINGTON --  Cubs manager Joe Maddon said he was seeking fairness when he questioned the legality of Washington Nationals closer Sean Doolittle's delivery in the ninth inning Saturday night and ultimately protested the game.	That wasn't Doolittle's interpretation.	"He's not trying to do anything other than rattle me," Doolittle said. "And it was kind of tired."	After eight solid innings by Stephen Strasburg in Washington's 5-2 win over the Cubs, Doolittle pitched the ninth for his eighth save in nine chances, but Maddon complained twice to the umpires that he was using an illegal delivery. The Chicago manager believed the left-handed Doolittle was tapping his right toe on the ground before coming to the plate.	Cubs reliever Carl Edwards Jr. was informed at the end of spring training that his delivery, which featured a similar toe-tap, was illegal -- a ruling that miffed Maddon and the Cubs.	"Listen, I have no qualms against Doolittle," Maddon said. "He's great, but they took it away from our guy, so for me to sit in the dugout and permit that to happen while they stripped us of that ability earlier this year with Carl ... how could I do that? You can't do that. I've got to say something."	Mariners reliever Cory Gearrin was warned by umpires during a game Monday night regarding the same violation, even though he said he has used the same delivery for years.	Doolittle, who retired the side in order, thought Maddon had a different motive.	"I don't know, sometimes he has to remind people how smart he is and how much he pays attention to the game and stuff like that," Doolittle said. "He put his stamp on it for sure."	The umpires saw nothing wrong with Doolittle's delivery.	"(Maddon) thought (Doolittle) was tapping his foot, which in itself is not illegal, and this all kind of stems from his pitcher being called on something that was a little bit different than what Doolittle was doing," crew chief Sam Holbrook told a pool reporter. "So, in our judgment, Doolittle did nothing illegal at all."	Nationals manager Davey Martinez, a former Maddon coaching staff member, didn't comment on Maddon's move.	"They protested the game, obviously," he said. "We'll let the umpires handle all that stuff. In my eyes, Doo' was Doo' and Strasburg was unbelievable."	A day after the Cubs scored 11 runs against five Washington relievers in the final three innings of a 14-6 win, Strasburg gave most of the bullpen a needed night off. He allowed two runs -- one earned -- and struck out seven without a walk while throwing 93 pitches.	Juan Soto had two hits and drove in three for Washington.	David Bote homered in the sixth to pull the Cubs, who have lost three of four, within 5-2.	Chicago's Jon Lester, who hadn't given up an earned run in his last three outings, a span totaling 19 2/3 innings, allowed five runs and 10 hits in 4 1/3 innings.	He had only allowed a total of five earned runs over his first seven starts of the season.	Chicago's Kris Bryant was 0 for 4 and reached on a fielder's choice, ending his streak of reaching base safely at 26 games, and Javier Baez ended his hitting streak at 15 games.	Brian Dozier's homer gave the Nationals a 1-0 lead. Soto's two-run double capped a three-run third inning and he added an RBI single in the fifth.	Strasburg didn't allow a hit until Kyle Schwarber's single to start the fourth. The Cubs' first run came with two outs in the fifth on consecutive passed balls by Kurt Suzuki.	LESTER'S LAMENT	"I felt good physically," Lester said. "Almost too good. Just couldn't repeat my mechanics, couldn't repeat pitches. I'd make a good one, then three bad ones."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: Placed RHP Justin Miller (right rotator cuff strain) on the 10-day injured list and recalled RHP Tanner Rainey from Triple-A Fresno. ... OF Victor Robles is day-to-day after being hit on the left wrist with a pitch on Friday night. ... RHP Erick Fedde will start Tuesday against the Mets in place of RHP Anibal Sanchez (left hamstring strain.)	UP NEXT	Cubs: RHP Kyle Hendricks (3-4, 2.86) is 2-0 with a 0.36 ERA in his past three starts, going at least eight innings each time. He's 2-2 with 2.61 ERA in seven career starts against the Nationals.	Nationals: RHP Jeremy Hellickson (2-2, 6.00) is 1-1 with a 6.06 ERA in three career starts against the Cubs.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

BOSTON --  The Houston Astros are sending an early message to the rest of baseball.	They're playing and sounding like they're the best.	Tyler White's two-run double capped a five-run first inning, Josh Reddick hit a solo homer and the Astros kept rolling, beating the Boston Red Sox 7-3 Saturday night for their 10th straight victory.	"I feel like this is the team to beat," Reddick said. "We have the target on us, even though we didn't make it all the way last year."	Michael Brantley had three hits and an RBI for Houston (31-15), which matched the best start in franchise history -- along with the 2017 World Series winning team -- after 46 games. It's the Astros' second 10-game streak this season.	"We want to keep winning as many games as we can," Houston manager A.J. Hinch said. "Obviously, it's a huge accomplishment. These guys out here, they're playing hard, they're playing well, we're playing good defense, we're pitching, we're hitting. When we play all facets like that, we have a chance to win every night."	Christian Vazquez hit a solo homer for the Red Sox, who had won six of eight.	The Astros can complete a three-game series sweep Sunday when they send left-hander Wade Miley against Boston ace Chris Sale.	It's the first meeting between the teams since the Red Sox ousted Houston in last fall's American League Championship series en route to their World Series title.	Josh James (1-0) got the victory with three innings of hitless relief after starter Corbin Martin went four, giving up three runs, two earned, in his second major league start.	Boston spot starter Hector Velazquez (1-3) retired just one batter, giving up five runs and three hits with two walks and had a spattering of boos cascading down as he walked off.	"I made a couple of mistakes and tried to battle through it. I just couldn't," he said through a translator.	George Springer opened the game with a triple off the center-field wall, just over a leaping bid by Jackie Bradley Jr. on the first pitch. Brantley made it 1-0 with an RBI double over the head of right fielder Mookie Betts' leap at the shorter bullpen wall before Reddick's sacrifice fly.	Yuli Gurriel's bloop single made it 3-0 and chased Velazquez. White then hit reliever Colten Brewer's first pitch down the right-field line for a two-run double.	"That's what they do," Boston manager Alex Cora said. "They battle with two strikes and they put good swings with two strikes. It was a bad one today."	MONSTER MAY	After losing their first two games this month, the Astros have won 13 of 14 and closed in on the longest winning streak in franchise history of 12, accomplished in 1999 and 2004.	TIME LAPSE	The first inning lasted 44 minutes. After Houston's big start, Boston loaded the bases on consecutive two-out walks and scored one run on Max Stassi's passed ball before Rafael Devers lined to left.	INTERESTING TO HEAR	Red Sox LF Andrew Benintendi's walk-up song is `Houston, We Got a Problem' by country music star Luke Combs.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: Hinch said he'd like to stay away from INF Aledmys Diaz, who exited Friday with left hamstring discomfort, for the rest of this series. "He's not going to play unless it's a huge emergency of some sort," Hinch said. "Luckily, the diagnosis is very mild." . Despite not being in the lineup, C Robinson Chirinos was fine after being shaken up by a foul tip late in Friday's win. "It's predetermined that he was going to sit," Hinch said. . 2B Jose Altuve (Injured List, strained left hamstring) worked out on the field.	Red Sox: Both utility player Brock Holt (IL, scratched right eye) and 2B Dustin Pedroia (soreness left knee) continued their rehab assignments with Triple-A Pawtucket. Cora said Holt was scheduled to play second Saturday and Sunday with Pedroia the DH both days.	UP NEXT	Astros: Hinch shuffled his rotation and said Miley (4-2, 3.51 ERA) would start the series finale with RHP Brad Peacock being pushed to Monday.	Red Sox: LHP Sale (1-5, 4.24) looks to continue his stellar turnaround after a rough start this season. In his last outing, he became the first pitcher in major league history to strike out 17 in only seven innings and also the first ever with three or fewer hits, strike out at least 14 without allowing a walk in consecutive starts.	--	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ATLANTA --  Freddie Freeman marveled at Austin Riley's continued hot start and then showed the new kid how to end a game with flair.	Freeman led off the 10th inning with a home run into the right-field seats , lifting the Atlanta Braves to a 4-3 win over the Milwaukee Brewers on Saturday night.	The Braves recovered to win their fourth straight game after Luke Jackson blew a 3-2 lead in the ninth.	Freeman pulled a fastball from Josh Hader (0-3) for his 10th homer.	Braves manager Brian Snitker called the matchup "two of the best left-handers in the game right there, going one-on-one."	The tough matchup didn't alter Freeman's approach. Asked what he was looking for, Freeman said: "A strike, the same with anybody on the mound. Just looking for a pitch to hit."	Jacob Webb (2-0) pitched a perfect 10th for Atlanta.	Riley, the Braves' rookie left fielder still in his first week in the majors, hit a go-ahead, two-run homer in the sixth for a 3-2 lead.	"For what he's doing the first four games, it's hard to put in words," Freeman said. "... He's aggressive. He's aggressive in the zone. He's taking pitches out of the zone, which is very hard for a young guy. I'm just very impressed with how he has approached his first four games."	Riley joined the on-field celebration when his new teammates surrounded Freeman following the game-winning homer, drenching the first baseman with a cooler.	"For Freddie to hit a walk-off was super cool," Riley said. "I've never been a part of anything like that."	Riley's homer off left-hander Alex Claudio gave him eight hits, including two homers, in four games since he was called up from Triple-A Gwinnett. The eight hits are an Atlanta record for a player's first four games.	Riley singled in the second but made a rookie mistake when he was fooled by shortstop Hernan Perez, who pretended to field a throw at second on Brian McCann's fly ball to fight field. Riley slid head-first into second before standing to watch right fielder Christian Yelich throw to first base to complete the double play.	The front of Riley's shirt was still covered in dirt when he made up for his mistake with the homer.	The Brewers left the bases loaded in the third and ninth and left 10 runners on base overall.	"We didn't capitalize enough on our offensive opportunities," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said, adding the missed chances "cost us in the end."	Jackson hit Keston Hiura with a pitch to open the ninth. Hiura moved to third on Orlando Arcia's one-out single to right and scored on Lorenzo Cain's high bouncer over third baseman Josh Donaldson for a 3-3 tie.	Braves right-hander Kevin Gausman allowed two runs in six innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: Counsell says a decision must be made on RHP Jimmy Nelson (right shoulder) and his possible place on the staff following one more rehab assignment with Triple-A San Antonio on Thursday. Nelson gave up three hits in 5 1/3 scoreless innings Friday night.	Braves: Donaldson likely will be given a rest Sunday. Snitker said he plans to give Riley his first start at third base. Riley made his fourth straight start in left field after pregame fielding drills at third base, his primary position in the minors.	ANDERSON'S RETURN	Milwaukee right-hander Chase Anderson came off the injured list to allow one unearned run on two hits with four walks in four innings in his first start of May. He was placed on the injured list on May 1 due to a blister on his right middle finger.	ROSTER MOVES	The Braves released left-hander Jonny Venters, whose comeback from his third Tommy John surgery helped him win the NL Comeback Player of the Year Award last year. Venters, 34, had a 17.36 ERA in nine appearances. The Braves recalled left-hander Jerry Blevins only four days after he was designated for assignment. The Brewers optioned right-hander Jacob Barnes to Triple-A San Antonio.	BIG THROW	Yelich threw out Markakis at the plate to end the eighth. Markakis was trying to score from second on Ozzie Albies' single.	UP NEXT	Brewers: RHP Brandon Woodruff (6-1, 3.72) will make his first career appearance against Atlanta in Sunday's final game of the three-game series. He has won his last four starts and is 5-0 over his last six starts.	Braves: RHP Mike Foltynewicz (0-3, 8.02) is 2-2 with a 2.90 ERA in six career games, including five starts, against the Brewers.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

SAN DIEGO --  The Pittsburgh Pirates jumped on rookie lefty Nick Margevicius for a season home run milestone Saturday night.	Josh Bell homered twice and drove in four, rookie Bryan Reynolds connected for the second straight night and the Pirates had their first four-homer game of the season in beating the San Diego Padres 7-2.	Margevicius (2-5) allowed the four homers in four-plus innings.	"It was a really good day for us at the ballpark," manager Clint Hurdle said. "A lot of guys contributed."	Bell has three career multihomer games, all in his last 14 games. He also had two homers against Oakland on May 4 and at Arizona on Tuesday. He's homered 14 times this year.	The switch-hitter homered to left leading off the second, followed by Reynolds' shot, also to left. Bell homered to left-center with one out in the third, with Adam Frazier aboard on a single and Starling Marte on a double.	"That right-handed swing is stronger than we've seen it in the past, evident by the swings today," Hurdle said. "Both those balls were hit very, very well. It's two more homers than he hit all last year, and it's just past the middle of May."	Padres manager Andy Green said Margevicius' fastball "was leaking on him from the beginning. I think that Josh Bell's second home run was a pitch we wanted out of the zone for sure, and he left it in the middle of the plate for him."	Reynolds has three homers, including one in Friday night's 5-3 victory.	Polanco lined a homer to right leading off the fifth, his fourth, to chase Margevicius.	Bell and Elias Diaz each had three hits.	Pittsburgh used an opener for the first time, with rookie righty Montana DuRapau holding San Diego to one hit in two scoreless innings while striking out four and walking one. He was making his first big league start and fifth appearance. He was a 32nd-round selection -- the 971st pick overall -- in the 2014 draft and made his major league debut May 9.	After allowing Hunter Renfroe's single to open the second, DuRapau struck out rookie Ty France, Wil Myers and Austin Hedges.	Steven Brault (1-1), who played at Grossmont High in suburban El Cajon, replaced DuRapau and allowed two runs and four hits in 3 1/3 innings.	"It was really cool" pitching at home, Brault said. "There was a lot of emotion. Last year I pitched here and didn't pitch very long. This year to be able to come in, that first inning was a nightmare but this has been my year so far. To do it in San Diego was cool, with my friends and family all here was great."	Brault allowed an RBI single by Manny Machado with one out in the third and then got out of a bases-loaded jam by getting Renfroe to hit into a double play. He also allowed an RBI single by rookie Austin Allen in the sixth. It was Allen's first big league RBI.	"I wasn't very sharp in the first inning and then got much better after that, and I think that's maybe having to bear down more, like I'm coming in from the bullpen," Brault said. "All the pitchers, the whole staff did really well tonight and it's nice when the offense scores five runs for you early."	Margevicius allowed six runs and eight hits in four-plus innings, struck out two and walked one.	He has three losses and a no-decision in his last four starts.	"I've been falling behind in counts," Margevicius said. "Definitely part of the last game and this game, falling behind has not been good for me."	KINSLER'S FINE	Warstic, a bat company co-owned by Padres second baseman Ian Kinsler, advertised a 20 percent off sale on Twitter and Instagram on Saturday to help raise funds to pay the fine levied against him by MLB for using profanity after hitting a three-run homer Thursday night. The promo code was FLIPOFF20, perhaps a reference to Kinsler's bat flip after the homer. Kinsler said he used profanity to fire up his teammates, although many fans felt it was directed at him. The Twitter and Instagram posts were later deleted. According to Bleacher Report, Kinsler was fined between $7,500 and $10,000. He's making $3.75 million this season as part of an $8 million, two-year deal. MLB declined to confirm the fine amount.	UP NEXT	Pirates: RHP Joe Musgrove (2-4, 3.59), who also pitched at Grossmont High, is scheduled to start the series finale Sunday. He beat the Padres 1-0 at Petco Park on June 29, striking out five in seven innings.	Padres: Rookie RHP Cal Quantrill (0-1, 3.60) will rejoin the team to make his third career start. He made his most recent start on May 1 and optioned to Triple-A El Paso on May 7.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Mike Trout's 250th home run was memorable in more ways than one.	Trout's solo shot to left-center off traveled 473 feet and made him the sixth AL player to reach 250 homers before his 28th birthday as the Los Angeles Angels beat the Kansas City Royals 6-3 on Saturday night.	The first-inning blast off Royals starter Jakob Junis (3-5) was also his second-longest since Statcast began measuring them in 2015 and the third-longest in the majors this season.	"I didn't see it land. I stopped watching," Angels manager Brad Ausmus said. "As soon as he hit it, I knew it was gone."	Shohei Ohtani also went deep and Griffin Canning pitched seven shutout innings as the Angels got their fourth win in five games this season against the Royals.	Ohtani's two-run homer to right in the sixth was his second of the season. Last season's AL Rookie of the Year missed the first 34 games following Tommy John surgery.	After going hitless in first seven at-bats, Ohtani has gone 12 for 35 with two home runs and has a six-game hitting streak.	"I'm getting better each at-bat I get. It is not 100, but getting closer and closer," Ohtani said through a translator.	Canning (2-1) is only the second Angels starter to go at least seven innings, which is worst in the majors. The rookie right-hander retired the first 12 Royals he faced and allowed three hits with five strikeouts. Ty Buttrey worked the final 1 2/3 innings for his second save.	"I wasn't being super tentative and let my stuff work in the zone," he said.	After Trout's homer, the Angels added another run in the second when Kole Calhoun led off with a double and scored on Jonathan Lucroy's single.	Los Angeles added three in the sixth. Trout walked with one out before Ohtani clubbed a two-run shot over the right field wall for his first home run at Angels Stadium this season. Andrelton Simmons followed with a double to left and advanced to third on a throwing error. He scored on Calhoun's sacrifice fly to center to make it 5-0.	Kansas City got on the board with three in the eighth off Taylor Cole. Whit Merrifield had a two-run double and scored on Adalberto Mondesi's bloop single.	Lucroy, who had two hits, singled in Simmons in the eighth inning to extend the Angels' lead to three runs.	Junis also went seven innings and yielded five runs (four earned) on six hits with six strikeouts.	"I thought he threw the ball well. He's just not pitching with a lot of luck right now," Royals manager Ned Yost said of Junis. "Every once in a while, you will throw a fastball down the middle and they will either foul it off or pop it up. That isn't happening. Just got burned on a couple of mistakes."	TRACKING TROUT	Trout joins Jimmie Foxx, Mickey Mantle, Juan Gonzalez, Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez as the only AL players to hit 250 or more home runs before their age 28 season.	He is also the 13th player to accomplish that milestone overall. Teammate Albert Pujols, Mel Ott, Eddie Mathews, Frank Robinson, Hank Aaron, Andruw Jones and Giancarlo Stanton reached it while playing in the NL.	Eight of Trout's 10 homers this season have come at home. The tape-measure shot fell 4 feet shy of his career best, which came at Coors Field off Colorado's Chris Rusin in 2015.	ROUGH STARTS	Junis has allowed nine runs in the first inning 10 starts this season. Teams are hitting .333 against him in the opening frame (14 for 42), including four home runs.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals: Kansas City has requested release waivers on Frank Schwindel, who was designated for assignment Tuesday. Schwindel was the opening day first baseman but had just one hit in 15 at-bats in six games. There is a possibility he could be re-signed to a minor league contract.	Angels: OF Justin Upton (turf toe) is doing some throwing and hitting, but the only running he is doing is on a treadmill. He is eligible to come off the 60-day injured list near the end of the month but said that it will "be a while" before he returns.	UP NEXT	Royals: LHP Danny Duffy (2-1, 3.97 ERA) has won his last two starts. He is 2-2 in seven career outings against the Angels, including a 5-1 loss on April 26 when he allowed three runs on five hits in five innings.	Angels: LHP Tyler Skaggs (4-3, 5.05 ERA) has won three of his four starts since returning from the injured list (left ankle sprain). Teams have a .268 batting average against him, which is the highest among LA's starting staff.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

PHOENIX --  His pitching line didn't completely indicate it, but Madison Bumgarner couldn't have felt better on the mound Saturday night. It helped that his San Francisco Giants teammates provided plenty of run support.	Bumgarner allowed four runs and five hits with six strikeouts in 6 1/3 innings in the Giants' 8-5 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks.	He won for the third time in his last four starts, and is 6-1 with a 2.58 ERA in his last 12 starts at Chase Field.	"This is as good as I've felt. I'm throwing the ball as good as I ever have," said Bumgarner (3-4). "And the results not being there to match up is frustrating, but when our offense is putting up eight (runs), then it's easier to deal with.	"But it's about winning, and that's it."	Pablo Sandoval and Brandon Belt hit solo home runs for the Giants. Sandoval pinch-hit in the eighth inning with two outs and drove a 2-2 pitch from Matt Andriese over the right-field fence for his second career pinch-homer.	Belt's home run, also off Andriese, splashed down in the pool beyond right field in the top of the ninth with two outs.	"How about that?" Giants manager Bruce Bochy said of Sandoval. "It's nice to start him, but when he doesn't start, it's nice to have him come off the bench, too. When you look at our offense, he's the silver lining through our struggles, I think."	Eduardo Escobar homered and became the first Diamondback to 10 home runs on the season. Carson Kelly hit his third home run, and Adam Jones added two RBI.	Zack Godley (1-4) has allowed four or more earned runs in five of his eight starts this season and hasn't made it beyond four innings in each of the last four. That included Saturday, when the Giants reached four runs off Godley in the third inning.	San Francisco turned a 1-0 lead into 4-0 on Steven Duggar's RBI triple, Buster Posey's RBI single and Brandon Crawford's sacrifice fly.	"We put some really good swings on some balls when he did make a mistake," Duggar said of Godley. "We just kind of kept the lineup going and we just kind of fed off each other."	After Godley walked Bumgarner with one out in the fourth and heard boos from the crowd, manager Torey Lovullo removed him. Godley lasted 3 1/3 innings, allowing four runs and six hits with three strikeouts.	For his part, Godley was encouraged with his outing.	"I felt awesome. The biggest thing was being able to put people away," he said. "I felt like I was back to where I needed to be. I was back to throwing the ball where I wanted with intent."	Escobar's home run led off the fourth, and the Diamondbacks made it 4-2 when Jones singled in Blake Swihart from second base with two outs.	The Diamondbacks cut the lead to 6-4 and had runners at the corners in the seventh, but couldn't add more in that inning.	RANDY'S NIGHT	The Diamondbacks commemorated the 15th anniversary of Hall of Famer Randy Johnson's perfect game against Atlanta. Fans received a Johnson figurine, and "The Big Unit" threw out the ceremonial first pitch.	INJURY SETBACK	Diamondbacks right-hander Taijuan Walker isn't going to throw for at least six weeks after injuring his shoulder during a rehab start earlier in the week.	Walker received a platelet-rich plasma injection in his shoulder, which will delay his return from major elbow surgery that was on track for midway through this season. He made only three starts in 2018.	"I don't want to push through it and make it worse," Walker said. "I don't think it's bad enough for surgery. It's just swelling."	HOT CORNER	Both teams got highlight-reel defensive plays from their respective third basemen. Evan Longoria took a hit away from Ketel Marte to end the fifth, and Escobar snagged Kevin Pillar's hard line drive on the fly in the sixth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Giants: RHP Johnny Cueto threw a bullpen session off flat ground before Saturday's game, and the Giants were encouraged enough by what they saw for Bochy to say that Cueto could come back from Tommy John surgery before the season ends. Cueto had elbow reconstructive surgery last August.	Diamondbacks: RHP Zack Greinke is on track to make his next scheduled start, Tuesday at San Diego, on five days' rest, after a bullpen session that Lovullo said went well Saturday. Greinke had an MRI on Friday that revealed no damage to his abdominal area after he left his last start with a trainer. ... OF David Peralta was held out of the lineup after aggravating pain in his upper back and shoulder area Friday night.	UP NEXT	Giants: Bochy said LHP Drew Pomeranz is set to come off the injured list and start Sunday's series finale against Arizona. Pomeranz (1-4) went on the 10-day injured list on May 9.	Diamondbacks: LHP Robbie Ray (3-1) faces the Giants with a 4-1 career mark against them. He's 3-0 with a 1.98 ERA in his last five starts this season, and has 35 strikeouts.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.

SEATTLE -- The Minnesota Twins' offense has been rolling all season. They had their best game yet Saturday night against the Seattle Mariners.	C.J. Cron and Jonathan Schoop each hit two home runs and Byron Buxton had a grand slam as the Twins cruised to an 18-4 victory. Miguel Sano also homered for the Twins, who extended their season-high home run streak to 13 games and moved into a tie with Seattle for the major league home run lead with 87.	"It's fun to put on that kind of offensive performance," Cron said. "One through nine, we all swung it really well, so it was fun to watch."	Minnesota's 18 runs were a season high. The Twins have won the first three games of the four-game series, outscoring the Mariners 36-11. Minnesota became the first team in major league history to have five games with at least five home runs before the start of June.	"There's no weak spots in our lineup," Cron said. "As a pitcher, that can't be a comfortable thing. They have to be on their game for every batter."	Seattle's Wade LeBlanc (2-1), making his first start in more than a month after returning from the injured list, gave up seven runs and seven hits -- including a career-worst four home runs.	"Those guys over there, there's not much you can say," LeBlanc said. "I want to say that's the best hitting team I've ever faced in my life. That's how they looked tonight."	LeBlanc left his last outing on April 12 with a strained right oblique. Before Saturday's game, Mariners manager Scott Servais said he hoped LeBlanc would have a "competitive outing" against the Twins, with a pitch limit around 75 pitches. LeBlanc didn't meet either goal, getting knocked out in the third inning after throwing just 49 pitches.	Minnesota's offense started the rout in the second inning when Cron hit his first homer, the 100th of his career. Later in the inning, Buxton's grand slam -- the Twins' first of the year -- opened the floodgates.	Buxton and Schoop both tied career highs with five RBIs. Buxton added a run-scoring single to his grand slam, and Schoop had two-run and three-run homers.	Twins starter Jose Berrios was looking to rebound after his roughest outing of the season, during which he gave up five runs and 12 hits, both season highs, in a home loss to the Los Angeles Angels on Monday. Berrios cruised through the first four innings in this one, but he wasn't able to pick up the win. He was pulled in the fifth after giving up four runs and six hits in the inning, and throwing 105 pitches overall.	"Some very long breaks for him, multiple very long breaks in only four innings," Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. "That can definitely be challenging. If it wasn't for purely pitch count reasons, we'd probably let him go out there and finish the inning."	Tyler Duffey (1-0) came on and went 1⅓ innings to earn the victory.	IN RELIEF	Mariners backup catcher Tom Murphy pitched the ninth inning, retiring all three batters he faced with two strikeouts. He was the sixth Seattle pitcher and the only one not to give up a run or a hit or walk a batter.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: INF Dylan Moore started a rehab assignment with Triple-A Tacoma on Saturday. Moore has been on the injured list since May 10 with a wrist contusion. ... RHP Sam Tuivailala, recovering from a right Achilles tendon rupture, also is with Tacoma for rehab after being transferred from Single-A Modesto. ... Servais said RHP Gerson Bautista, who strained his right pectoral muscle in spring training, also will start a rehab assignment at Tacoma soon.	ROSTER MOVE	Seattle optioned RHP Matt Festa to Triple-A Tacoma to make room on the roster for LeBlanc.	FIRST TIME	Luis Arraez made his major league debut for the Twins, entering in the fifth inning as a defensive replacement at shortstop. He doubled in the eighth inning.	UP NEXT	Twins: Kyle Gibson (3-1, 4.19 ERA) makes his ninth start in the final game of the four-game series with Seattle.	Mariners: Yusei Kikuchi (2-1, 3.64) has gone at least six innings and given up three runs or fewer in all three of his starts in May.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

BOSTON --  Michael Chavis pointed to a young boy in the press box, letting him know how impressed he was that a 5-year-old announced his name so well.	Boston's rookie sparkplug then stepped to the plate and gave the kid something extra to be excited about.	Chavis homered on the next pitch after acknowledging the boy, Xander Bogaerts hit a tiebreaking double in the seventh inning and the Red Sox averted a series sweep against Houston with a 4-3 victory Sunday that snapped the Astros' 10-game winning streak.	"I heard a kid's voice and I looked up and I was so surprised," Chavis said after hitting his eighth homer in 25 major league games. "I was impressed how confident he was. When I was a kid, I don't think I would have even done it. Right before I got in the box, I thought I should say good job."	For an inning on Sundays, the Red Sox have kids announce players' names as they walk up to the plate.	Mookie Betts scored three runs for Boston, which lost the first two games in the first meeting with the Astros since beating them in the 2018 AL Championship Series.	Carlos Correa hit a two-run homer off Chris Sale for Houston, which is 13-4 in May.	"They played better today, they outhit us, but our at-bats against Sale were good," Astros manager AJ Hinch said. "We'll see him again in five days."	Houston outfielder George Springer, who began the day leading the American League with 17 homers, exited in the fifth with lower back stiffness. He took three big swings in the first inning, striking out. On the last two, Springer appeared to reach briefly for the lower right side of his back. He also struck out swinging his next two times up against Sale.	"My back stiffened up," Springer said. "Not necessarily ideal. We'll see what happens. Hopefully, I'll feel better (Monday)."	Hinch said Springer will be re-evaluated in Houston and won't play Monday night.	In the seventh, Bogaerts' double off Framber Valdez (1-2) to deep left-center scored Betts scored from first base.	Sale struck out 10 in 5 1/3 innings, giving up three runs and four hits with five walks. In his previous start, he became the first major league pitcher to strike out 17 batters in seven innings.	"It was kind of a weird day," he said. "I was kind of all over the place. At times I felt like I was right where I wanted to be and other times, I was trying to just throw a strike."	Marcus Walden (6-0) escaped a bases-loaded, one-out jam and tossed 1 2/3 scoreless innings of relief. Brandon Workman got three outs for his first career save.	Trailing 3-1 in the fifth, the Red Sox scored twice with two outs against Wade Miley. Chavis homered over the Green Monster. Betts then doubled and scored on Bogaerts' single, a pop fly that dropped in shallow right field after second baseman Yuli Gurriel drifted out for it and got twisted around.	Correa drove a 94 mph fastball an estimated 448 feet into the center field bleachers, making it 3-1 in the third.	Miley gave up three runs in five innings.	YOU'RE FIRST, ROOK	Chavis batted leadoff for the first time, going 2 for 4.	"Just watching the other side, why not?" Red Sox manager Alex Cora said in reference to Springer, the Astros' leadoff hitter. "Swing hard and hit it out of the ballpark. We'll see what happens."	The move gave Boston six right-handed batters at the top of the order against Miley, a lefty.	Asked if he was excited after the game, Chavis said: "Yeah, of course. That probably means I'm going to get more at-bats. It's awesome."	NICE HANDS, SKIP	Cora caught J.D. Martinez's soft foul ball standing on the second step of the dugout.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: C Robinson Chirinos was in the lineup after getting a scheduled day off. He was shaken up by a foul ball Friday, but stayed in the game.	Red Sox: 2B Dustin Pedroia (left knee soreness) was slated to play second base twice this week for Triple-A Pawtucket after being the DH in two games, which would give him four straight starts. He went 1 for 4 on Sunday. "That's four in a row, but he was DH twice," Cora said. "We need him to play second." ... C Sandy Leon is due back from paternity leave Monday after his wife gave birth to a daughter.	UP NEXT	Astros: RHP Brad Peacock (4-2, 4.01 ERA) is in line to start the opener of a four-game series at home against the Chicago White Sox on Monday.	Red Sox: LHP David Price (1-2, 3.75) is scheduled to come off the injured list Monday night at Toronto. He's been sidelined with left elbow tendinitis since May 3.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

NEW YORK --  In a season they never quite envisioned, the New York Yankees broke loose for their biggest inning of the year in a way they didn't imagine.	Brett Gardner homered early, then got two hits during a seven-run burst in the sixth inning fueled by five walks that sent the Yankees past the Tampa Bay Rays 13-5 on Sunday.	The Yankees took their second straight weekend series with Tampa Bay and moved a half-game in front atop the AL East. The Rays had been alone in first place for 47 straight days before New York scored three times in the ninth for a 4-3 win in the series opener Friday night.	With many of their stars still on the injury list, the Yankees continued to get major contributions from substitutes.	"Coming into and out of spring training, there's no way anybody could have foreseen these opportunities that have arisen," Gardner said. "I think some of these young guys have done a great job of really stepping up, coming up here and doing their job."	Rookie Thairo Estrada had a pinch-hit, three-run double in the Yankees' game-breaking inning.	"Thairo to me has been one of the faces of what we're doing right now," manager Aaron Boone said.	Aaron Hicks homered for the first time since returning from a back injury and DJ LeMahieu also connected to help the Yankees win for the 10th time in 13 games.	Kevin Kiermaier and Wily Adames homered on consecutive pitches in the second to give the Rays a 2-1 lead. Brandon Lowe hit a three-run homer, his third of the series, to make it 5-3.	After Lowe homered in the third, it was all Yankees on the mound and at the plate.	Hicks tied the game in the fourth off Charlie Morton and Adam Ottavino (2-1) struck out Austin Meadows with the bases loaded to end the sixth and keep the score tied at 5.	Chance Adams pitched three scoreless innings for his first career save. He was sent back to Triple-A after the game.	Gardner, who hit a two-run homer off Morton in the second, started the Yankees sixth with a single off the glove of Diego Castillo (0-3).	Two walks and one out later, Luke Voit drew a bases-loaded walk off Castillo. Kendrys Morales later drew a bases-loaded walk off Ryne Stanek for a 7-5 lead and Gleyber Torres drove in a run with an infield single.	After Estrada's big hit, Gardner capped the inning with an RBI double.	"Our pitching has been outstanding for us this year and they are going to continue to be outstanding. But today, it wasn't their day," Rays manager Kevin Cash said.	On the first anniversary of the Rays using an opener, the Yankees started Chad Green in that role. He allowed two runs on three hits while throwing 29 pitches in 1 2/3 innings.	MORTON'S STREAK	Morton wound up with a no-decision that extended his career-high unbeaten string to 17 games. He allowed five runs (three earned) on four hits in a season-low four innings and did not mince words when describing his outing. "It was terrible," Morton said.	SANCHEZ SOUVENIR	Yankees catcher Gary Sanchez hit his first career triple in the fifth. It came in the 1,104th career at-bat for the slow-footed Sanchez.	Sanchez lofted a flyball to right field and easily slid into third ahead of the throw. Sanchez got up and quickly signaled that he wanted the ball as a keepsake.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: INF Matt Duffy (left hamstring tightness) got three hits as the DH in a rehab game for Class A Charlotte. ... 3B Yandy Diaz left the game with a left hand contusion after hit being by Adams in the seventh. X-rays were negative and he is day-to-day. INF Daniel Robertson stayed in the game after getting hit in the helmet in the second.	Yankees: RHP Masahiro Tanaka (right shin contusion) was walking normally after being hit by Diaz's 111.3 mph grounder Saturday. Boone said Tanaka was still feeling some soreness and the Yankees will know in the next few days if he can make his next start. ... LHP James Paxton (left knee inflammation) threw 20 pitches during his third bullpen session. He threw while wearing a brace on his leg and said he felt some minor discomfort. Paxton will throw his fourth bullpen session Tuesday and could be activated for his next turn if that goes well. Paxton has not pitched since May 3. ... RHP Dellin Betances (right shoulder impingement) made 50 throws from 90 feet and said he felt good. Betances said he will play light catch Monday and then progress to 110 feet for a few days. Betances said he is not sure when he will get on a mound.	UP NEXT	Rays: Tampa Bay is expected to use an opener for the 14th time this season on Tuesday at home against the Los Angeles Dodgers, who will start Clayton Kershaw (3-0, 3.40 ERA).	Yankees: LHP J.A. Happ (3-3, 4.44 ERA) starts Monday against the Orioles for the second straight time in the opener of a four-game series at Baltimore.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

PHILADELPHIA --  Bryce Harper is back.	The $330 million slugger homered for the second straight day and pinch-hitter J.T. Realmuto also went deep to help the Philadelphia Phillies complete a three-game sweep of the Colorado Rockies with a 7-5 victory Sunday.	Harper's tiebreaking, two-run shot in the sixth inning wasn't as prodigious as his 466-foot drive in Saturday's 2-1 victory, but this 404-footer had plenty of distance to clear the right-center wall for the NL East leaders.	The 2015 NL MVP also had a first-inning single and an RBI groundout in the second. He is batting .417 with two homers and six RBI in his last three games after hitting .148 without an RBI while striking out 13 times during an eight-game stretch.	"We all knew this moment was coming," Phillies manager Gabe Kapler said. "When he's on, he's so captivating and charismatic."	Kapler resisted a daily growing buzz in Philadelphia to sit Harper during his recent slump, instead letting him play through it. While the results have changed, Harper's approach hasn't.	"Each day I try to get better and stick with the same routine," Harper said. "Keep progressing whether you're 0 for 4 or 4 for 4. Same mindset."	Ryan McMahon hit two homers, and Charlie Blackmon and Trevor Story also went deep for the Rockies on a picturesque, 85-degree day with the wind blowing out to center. Colorado, which dropped 9 1/2 games behind the first-place Dodgers in the NL West, has lost four straight.	Realmuto tied it at 5 in the sixth with his first career pinch-hit homer, a two-run shot to left off Bryan Shaw (2-1). Rockies manager Bud Black lifted Shaw for Mike Dunn with one on and two outs to face Harper, who launched a 3-1 slider into Philadelphia's bullpen.	"Got a pitch over the plate I could handle," Harper said.	That set off a wild celebration from the crowd of 38,603 -- many of them kids wearing an arm sleeve giveaway similar to Harper's.	Earlier in the week, Harper was hearing boos.	Now cheers.	No offense taken.	"Plain and simple, they (care)," Harper said. "The city has my back."	Edgar Garcia (1-0) got one out in the sixth for his first major league win. Pat Neshek pitched a scoreless ninth for his third save.	Despite starter Kyle Freeland's troubles, Colorado led 5-3 after McMahon went deep for the second time when he drove Jose Alvarez's 80 mph curve into the seats in right. In the fourth, McMahon cleared the wall in left. He has two career two-homer games -- both against the Phillies this season.	FOR STARTERS	Freeland continued to struggle. He finished fourth in NL Cy Young Award voting last season while setting a club record for the lowest ERA (2.85) by a lefty starter. But he exited after just 1 2/3 innings Sunday, giving up three runs and four hits. Freeland has an 8.03 ERA in his last five starts while allowing 28 hits -- nine homers -- over 24 2/3 innings with 14 walks.	"He was around the zone, but he just couldn't establish anything he could go to (for a strike)," Black said.	Phillies starter Jerad Eickhoff was tagged for three home runs. He has served up five long balls in his last two games after not giving up a homer over 31 innings to start the season.	FOR OPENERS	Blackmon began the game with his 33rd leadoff homer, tying Paul Molitor for 12th on the career list.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: Activated INF-OF Scott Kingery (strained right hamstring) from the injured list and sent OF Nick Williams to Triple-A Lehigh Valley. Kingery, starting in center field for the first time in his career, went 1 for 3.	UP NEXT	Rockies: Begin a three-game road trip Tuesday at Pittsburgh with RHP German Marquez (4-2, 3.80 ERA) opposing Pirates RHP Chris Archer (1-3, 5.58).	Phillies: Open a four-game series in Chicago on Monday night with RHP Jake Arrieta (4-4, 4.02 ERA), a member of the Cubs' 2016 World Series championship team, facing RHP Yu Darvish (2-3, 5.14).	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

CLEVELAND --  Shane Bieber was determined to finish what he started, even if it meant playing hide-and-seek with his pitching coach.	Bieber struck out a career-high 15 in his first major league complete game and the Cleveland Indians routed the Baltimore Orioles 10-0.	"It was one of those days where everything was working," he said. "Fortunately I was able to take advantage of it because they don't come too often. A lot of guys will tell you that, just be able to take advantage of it."	The 23-year-old Bieber gave up five hits, didn't walk anyone and threw 107 pitches. He bounced back from allowing four home runs against the Chicago White Sox in his last start.	Bieber received a loud ovation from the crowd of 21,377 when he took the mound for the ninth inning. He struck out Dwight Smith Jr., retired Joey Rickard on a groundout and whiffed Chris Davis to end the game.	The right-hander admitted he tried to stay away from pitching coach Carl Willis in the late innings, concerned he might not be given the chance to finish.	"I avoided Carl once and he found me again," Bieber said. "He said, `How much does it mean to you?' I said `a lot.' I was eyeing it the whole time."	Davis and Smith each struck out in all four at-bats. Steve Wilkerson and Hanser Alberto were the only starters who didn't strike out.	"That guy really threw the ball well," Davis said. "I mean, he was pretty dominant the whole game."	A day after being held to one hit, the Orioles were overmatched against Bieber (3-2).	Bieber's strong outing came the day after Adam Plutko held Baltimore to one run in six innings. The Indians are relying on the two young right-handers with Corey Kluber and Mike Clevinger out with injuries.	"We're always encouraged with Biebs because we know how he prepares," Indians manager Terry Francona said. "Nobody can forecast years down the road, but what we ask our guys to do, he does every bit of it."	Carlos Santana hit an RBI single in the first, then led off the third with his seventh home run of the season.	Cleveland took three of four from the Orioles. Baltimore has lost nine of 11 and has allowed a major league-leading 94 home runs.	"I'm looking forward to us coming to the park ready to play tomorrow," Baltimore manager Brandon Hyde said. "This game was lopsided from early on. We were in it yesterday, won the day before. Today we just got beat."	Yefry Ramirez (0-2) struggled in his first start of the season, giving up four earned runs in 3 1/3 innings.	Mike Freeman had a two-run double in the seventh while Oscar Mecardo had his first major league RBI with a sixth-inning double. Carlos Gonzalez, Roberto Perez and Jose Ramirez also drove in runs for the Indians.	THANKS, GUYS	Bieber's reward from his teammates was a postgame shower that consisted of an assortment of liquids.	"It smelled interesting," he said. "There were a lot of ingredients in it. It was the best/worst time of my life, for sure."	ADJUST, PLEASE	Hyde was disappointed his hitters didn't make any adjustments against Bieber.	"He kept throwing his slider down and I kept swinging at it, that's just stupidity on my part," Davis said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: Clevinger (strained muscle in upper back) threw 35 pitches in a bullpen session Saturday. He's expected to increase his workload in upcoming bullpen work over the next several days.	UP NEXT	Orioles: RHP Andrew Cashner (4-2, 4.10 ERA) will be making his second consecutive start against the New York Yankees in the opener of a four-game home series Monday. He allowed two runs in six innings in his last start, but got the loss.	Indians: RHP Carlos Carrasco (4-3, 4.18 ERA) is scheduled to make his seventh career start against Oakland in the opener of a three-game set Monday. Carrasco will be looking to extend his streak of 12 consecutive scoreless innings.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  Even the managers were perplexed by all the quirky details of a game that began nearly four months ago and finished in a different ballpark way out West.	Chad Pinder homered, Mike Fiers earned his fourth victory or his 14th, however you want to look at it, and the Oakland Athletics beat the Detroit Tigers 7-3 on Friday night in a game that was suspended on May 19 because of the weather.	"There were a lot of oddities," A's manager Bob Melvin said.	Then, the clubs played another one -- and it went extra innings.	Willi Castro hit a go-ahead double in the top of the 11th as the Tigers rallied from a four-run deficit to snap Oakland's three-game winning streak with a 5-4 victory in the regularly scheduled matchup.	Christin Stewart hit a two-run homer in the seventh for the Tigers, and John Schreiber (1-0) recorded two outs in the 10th for his first major league win.	"We've just played horrendous at home. We've played well on the road and don't ask me why, I don't know how," Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire said. "I don't understand why we're not doing this at home."	Paul Blackburn (0-2) got the loss.	Liam Hendriks pitched a 1-2-3 inning with two strikeouts in the earlier May 19 finish, and then another perfect inning with a pair of Ks later.	Fiers (14-3) is unbeaten over 21 starts dating to his no-hitter May 7. He allowed three runs and four hits over six innings.	Oakland reliever Jake Diekman will have two appearances on May 19 with two different clubs: He actually pitched one inning for the Royals in Anaheim on May 19, and then got into the game Friday for Oakland with the stats credited to May 19.	It took 39 minutes to finish the 2-hour, 58-minute game more than half a country away. Not many fans made it early on a Friday.	"It almost felt like a Legion game because when we went out there there was nobody there," Melvin said.	The victory gave the A's their first 11-game winning streak since winning 20 straight in 2002 and the longest in the majors this season. If the A's hadn't been able to hold on, it would have counted as a seven-game winning streak. Oakland also will be credited for an eight-game road winning streak from May 16-June 4.	Pinder connected for a two-run drive -- the A's hadn't cleared the fences yet on May 19 -- to give Oakland a streak of 17 straight games with a homer, matching the sixth-longest such streak in A's history. Pinder technically homered in his third straight game, from May 17-19 against the Tigers.	Stephen Piscotty had three hits, not playing at all Friday as he's on the injured list.	And in another strange twist, September call-ups were eligible but their stats go back to May when they were still in the minors -- while not changing the day of their major league debuts.	There was no national anthem because that took place May 19 in Detroit.	Melvin called Gardenhire ahead of time to discuss details of the game since neither had been part of this exact situation before -- and they also met with the umpires for guidance.	"It's not unprecedented, but it is different," Gardenhire said.	Yes, it sure was. While Hendriks struck out Jordy Mercer leading off the bottom of the seventh, the K will actually go to Josh Harrison considering he was supposed to be batting but got released by the Tigers last month.	"It doesn't happen very often," Melvin said. "I would prefer it doesn't happen again at some point."	Detroit wore its road uniforms for both games. Yet the A's made the Tigers feel plenty welcome for this wacky start -- well, finish -- to a weekend series.	The in-park electronic ribbon logos below the second deck read "WELCOME TO COMERICA PARK!" with THE COLISEUM crossed out in yellow. Detroit's logo was the main one on the scoreboard, too, with another Welcome to Comerica Park greeting.	THE JOY OF JACKSON	The A's were thrilled to see right-hander Edwin Jackson again now that he's on the Tigers. The well-traveled Jackson went 6-3 over 17 starts for Oakland last season as the club reached the playoffs for the first time since 2014.	Jackson has kept in touch with Melvin.	"He did so much for this team. It's always great to see him. He's about as infectious a guy as you'll ever see in a clubhouse," Melvin said. "Just love the guy."	Hearing of Melvin's kind words, Jackson grinned and said, "I'm blessed."	"I miss the boys," he added.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: CF Ramon Laureano returned from the injured list after being sidelined since July 29 with a stress reaction in his right leg. He started the later game. He went 0 for 4 with two strikeouts and drew big cheers during pregame introductions. ... RHP Blake Treinen is dealing with a back issue. ... RHP Yusmeiro Petit was in Venezuela following the death of his father and Melvin said there were travel complications that made it unclear when the versatile reliever might return, though it could be as soon as Saturday. ... Piscotty (sprained right ankle) will soon be out of a walking boot but the A's might need to get creative with his rehab at-bats given the minor league seasons ending. "I'm just glad he's progressing in the right direction," Melvin said.	UP NEXT	For Saturday's middle game of the series, Tigers right-hander Jordan Zimmermann (1-9, 6.03 ERA) tries for his first win in six starts since July 29. Oakland's Chris Bassitt (9-5, 3.67 ERA) pitches two days after his scheduled turn after being away earlier in the week for the birth of his daughter.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.	Jhoulys Chacín has agreed to a guaranteed $1.25 million, one-year contract with the Rockies.	The Milwaukee Brewers acquired infielder Mike Brosseau from the Tampa Bay Rays for minor league pitcher Evan Reifert on Saturday in a trade between division winners.

CINCINNATI -- Hyun-Jin Ryu's shutout streak rolls on.	Ryu blanked the Reds over seven innings to extend his major league-leading streak to 31, Cody Bellinger hit his 17th homer and the Los Angeles Dodgers beat Cincinnati 8-3 on Sunday.	"He's just locked in right now with all of his pitches," manager Dave Roberts said of his starting pitcher. "It's fun to watch. He's healthy. The conditions, the situations don't matter."	Ryu (6-1) had baserunners in each of his first five innings, but none of them got past second base and he retired his last eight batters. Ryu allowed five hits with one walk and five strikeouts and lowered his ERA to a National League-best 1.52 for the season. He went into the game second behind Milwaukee's Zach Davies.	"I wasn't crisp, especially early in the game," Ryu said through a translator. "There was a lot of traffic out there. I was able to execute the right pitches at the right time."	Alex Verdugo drove in three runs and Russell Martin added a solo homer for the West Division-leading Dodgers.	Verdugo's RBI double gave the Dodgers a 1-0 lead in the second inning and they added a run in the third on a fielder's choice.	Reds right fielder Yasiel Puig hit the wall while making a catch with the bases loaded to end the sixth inning.	Puig leaped and reached into the stands down the right-field line to catch Ryu's fly ball while colliding with the padded wall. He was on the warning track for a few seconds before jogging off the field, rubbing his left elbow.	He batted in the bottom of the inning before leaving the game after the seventh with what manager David Bell said was a sprained right shoulder.	"I felt a little bit tight," Puig said. "I take that AB after that I told them I don't feel good. My elbow I hit on the concrete, but I feel good about that."	Bellinger, who entered the game second in the NL in home runs behind Milwaukee's Christian Yelich, smacked left-handed relief pitcher Wandy Peralta's first pitch deep to center field, where it glanced off the glove of the leaping Nick Senzel and over the fence for a two-run homer.	"With Cody right now, it doesn't matter who's coming into the game," Roberts said.	The Dodgers added six runs against a Cincinnati bullpen that went into the game with a league-best 3.10 combined ERA.	Bellinger's homer made it 4-0 in the seventh inning. Martin gave Los Angeles a 5-0 lead in the eighth and the Dodgers added three runs in the ninth on a wild pitch and Verdugo's two-run double.	"The bullpen has done such a good job," Bell said. "That's going to happen. The game came down to one hit. The Bellinger home run was the difference in the game. It changed everything."	The Reds avoided being blanked in the ninth with Jose Peraza's two-out, two-run homer and Derek Dietrich's pinch-hit solo shot.	Reds starter Tanner Roark (3-3) tied his season high with seven strikeouts while allowing just two hits and two runs with three walks in five innings. He is 0-3 in his three starts against the Dodgers.	THROWBACK SUNDAY	As part of the franchise's celebration of the 150th anniversary of the first professional team, the Reds wore replica of the 1912 home uniforms, the third of 15 throwback uniforms they will wear this season.	LOST GLOVE	Cincinnati's Nick Senzel sent Dodger third baseman Justin Turner's glove flying when the two made contact while Turner was chasing Eugenio Suarez's popup that ended the third inning. Shortstop Corey Seager made the catch.	WELCOME, KYLE	After joining the Dodgers on Friday, Kyle Garlick made his major league debut on Sunday, flying out to left field as the pinch-hitter for Ryu in the eighth inning.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: Turner returned to the starting lineup after being limited on Saturday to pinch-hitting by a left shin contusion, the result of a foul tip on Friday.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: After Monday's day off, LHP Clayton Kershaw (3-0) is the scheduled starter on Tuesday at Tampa Bay in Los Angeles's first interleague series of the season.	Reds: After Monday's day off, RHP Sonny Gray (0-4) is the scheduled starter on Tuesday as Cincinnati opens a five-game road trip with the first of two in Milwaukee.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MIAMI --  The New York Mets aren't hitting, and another lapse by slugger Robinson Cano raised questions about how hard they're trying.	None of which helps the shaky job security of manager Mickey Callaway.	Sandy Alcantara needed just 89 pitches to throw a two-hitter in a duel with Noah Syndergaard , and the lowly Miami Marlins beat the reeling Mets 3-0 Sunday to complete a three-game sweep.	A day after being shut out on one hit, the Mets dropped their fifth in row. And for the second time in three games, Cano failed to run hard after hitting a groundball.	The latest unsightly defeat against a team with the worst record in the majors is sure to intensify speculation about Callaway's status as the team returns to New York. The Mets (20-25) have their longest losing streak of the year and are a season-worst five games under .500.	"I understand that everybody is disappointed -- the fans, the ownership, myself, the team -- because this is not who we are," Callaway said.	Callaway again found himself defending Cano, who failed to run when he hit a grounder that bounced off the dirt behind home plate and rolled a few feet fair. Cano stood at the plate questioning the call while the Marlins completed a 2-6-3 double play.	"I saw the ball hit and it didn't even hit the plate, it hit behind the plate," Cano said. "I thought it was a foul ball."	On Friday, Cano jogged to first when he grounded into an inning-ending 1-6-3 double play, and later told Callaway he thought there were two out.	"Things are piling up on Robbie right now," Callaway said when asked about Cano's latest bad look. "Come one, let's face it -- the ball lands foul and spins into fair territory. He saw it hit foul, and by the time he looked back up the ball had spun into fair territory and the play was over. Stuff happens like that when things are going bad."	Syndergaard (3-4) allowed two runs in seven innings, and afterward defended Callaway, who is in his second year as manager.	"I respect the hell out of Mickey," Syndergaard said. "It's kind of bull what's going on right now with the speculation that there could be a change, because we're still early in the season and just one small step from putting this all together. It's certainly not on him."	Part of the Mets' problem was Alcantara (2-4), who struck out eight, walked one and retired the last six batters for the Marlins' first complete game shutout since Edinson Volquez tossed a no-hitter against Arizona in June 2017. It was the first complete game for Alcantara, a 23-year-old righty acquired from St. Louis in a trade for Marcell Ozuna before last season.	"I felt great," Alcantara said. "I felt like a superstar about my complete game."	He also had a bunt single to set up the first run, and made a nifty behind-the-back grab of J.D. Davis' one-hopper in the first inning.	The Marlins (13-31), who came into the series with a seven-game losing streak, have their first three-game winning streak of the season. Their bandwagon is growing -- the crowd of 15,983 was the biggest at Marlins Park since opening day.	Miami became the first team to hold its opponent to three hits or less in consecutive shutouts since Philadelphia limited Atlanta to three hits on Sept. 1-2, 2014.	The Marlins won with six hits. Curtis Granderson hit his fifth homer for their final run in the eighth.	MATCHUP	Alcantara has made five of his 15 career starts against the Mets, and has an ERA of 2.14 with a 2-2 record.	PACE OF PLAY	The game took 1:59 to play. The first 19 batters went down in order, and the first three innings took only 31 minutes.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: LHP Luis Avilan (left elbow) is expected to begin playing catch soon.	Marlins: C Jorge Alfaro (left calf strain) might return to the lineup Tuesday. ... INF-OF Jon Berti (strained left oblique) was scratched from the lineup and is day to day.	UP NEXT	Mets: They begin a four-game series against Washington at home Monday with the starting pitcher to be announced.	Marlins: Following an off day, LHP Caleb Smith (3-1, 2.25) is scheduled to start Tuesday when Miami begins a seven-game trip in Detroit. Opponents are batting .180 against him, which ranks second among National League starters.	---	Follow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve-Wine .	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

MILWAUKEE -- — Freddy Peralta struck out eight over six scoreless innings, Avisail Garcia homered and the Milwaukee Brewers blew most of an 8-0 lead before holding on to beat the Atlanta Braves 10-9 on Sunday.	It nearly fell apart for Milwaukee after J.P. Feyereisen relieved Peralta to start the seventh. He retired one batter before allowed two walks and two infield singles to make it 8-2. Brent Suter came in and, after two fielder's-choice grounders that resulted in zero outs, surrendered a grand slam to center by NL MVP Freddie Freeman that made it 8-7.	The Brewers shook off their highest-scoring inning by an opponent this season and got some insurance with Lorenzo Cain's two-run single in the seventh. The Braves added a run in the eighth against Devin Williams and another in the ninth against Josh Hader, who struck out William Contreras for his ninth save.	“It was a wild game, but we hung on for a win,” Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. “The offense kind of picked up our bullpen and our defense, and it’s been kind of the opposite this year. But the offense picked us up today.”	Peralta (4-1) held Atlanta to two hits and a walk while recording eight strikeouts for a third consecutive appearance. Since allowing a season-high five runs over four innings against the Phillies on May 5, the right-hander has thrown 13 scoreless innings, allowing three hits and a pair of walks during that stretch.	“Freddy was brilliant again,” Counsell said. “I thought this was just a real clinical performance. He was on target all day, everything he did was good. Right from the get-go he was really good.”	Huascar Ynoa (4-2) allowed a season-high five runs on nine hits and two walks while striking out six over 4 1/3 innings. He had surrendered just one earned run over his previous three outings.	“I felt like some pitches weren’t going my way or falling into the spots that I wanted but at the same time, you have to give credit to the hitters on the other team," Ynoa said. “You have your good days and you have your bad days. You have to learn from the bad days.”	Cain had three hits and scored twice, Kolten Wong went 3-for-5 and scored three times, and Omar Narvaez also had three hits for the Brewers, who had scored a total of four runs over the last three games while going 1-for-24 with runners in scoring position.	“It was good to see balls fall and get some runs on the board," first baseman Daniel Vogelbach said. “We’ve had some really good at-bats this homestand that just haven’t gone our way.”	Vogelbach had a two-run double in the third, Narvaez made it 3-0 with a double in the fourth and Garcia hit a two-run homer off Ynoa in the fifth.	Freeman's homer was his 11th of the season, trailing only teammate Ronald Acuña Jr. in the NL.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Braves: Acuña played for the first time since suffering an ankle injury in Thursday's loss to the Blue Jays. He was held out of the lineup for a third straight game but struck out as a pinch-hitter in the eighth.	Brewers: OF Christian Yelich (sore back) will be reassessed during the team’s day off Monday. Yelich started a third straight game for Triple-A Nashville on Sunday and went 0-for-2.	UP NEXT	Braves: LHP Max Fried (1-1, 6.55 ERA) gets the start as the Braves return home to face RHP Taijuan Walker (3-1, 2.20) and the New York Mets on Monday.	Brewers: Open a five-game trip Tuesday with the first of two games at Kansas City. Right-hander Brandon Woodruff (2-1, 1.64) gets the start.	------	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CHICAGO --  Following a slow start, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. is showing why he's one of the top prospects in the majors.	Guerrero hit another home run, Danny Jansen and Billy McKinney also connected and the Toronto Blue Jays beat the Chicago White Sox 5-2 on Sunday.	Guerrero has hit all four of his homers in the past six games and is 7 for 21 with nine RBI during that span. The 20-year-old didn't homer in his first 13 games after making his debut in late April.	"Like I always say, I don't try to hit homers," Guerrero said through a translator. "I just try to put good contact on the ball, and we'll see what happens."	Guerrero's two-run drive broke a 1-all tie in the eighth inning. Jansen added a two-run homer in the ninth.	"You're hoping the guy in front of him gets on, because he has a chance to do something every time he goes to the plate," Toronto manager Charlie Montoyo said of Guerrero. "It's fun to have a guy like that in the lineup."	Jose Abreu drove in both runs for the White Sox.	Daniel Hudson (3-1) worked a scoreless seventh. Ken Giles gave up an RBI double to the first batter he faced, then got four outs for his 10th save.	Kelvin Herrera (1-3) took the loss.	Toronto starter Trent Thornton allowed one run and three hits in six innings. White Sox starter Reynaldo Lopez gave up one run and four hits in six innings.	"I did not have my best command today," Lopez said through a translator. "I fought through it. When you recognize that you don't have your best stuff, you just try to pitch through contact just to get a quick out."	McKinney's homer leading off the third gave Toronto a 1-0 lead. Chicago tied it in the fourth when Yoan Moncada tripled and scored on a groundout by Abreu.	Jonathan Davis led off the Toronto eighth with a single and Guerrero homered over the bullpen and halfway up the bleachers in left field.	White Sox catcher Welington Castillo was surprised the rookie was able to turn on the 94-mph fastball off the plate inside.	"Herrera made a good pitch," Castillo said. "It wasn't like in (the middle) of the plate, and he got to it. We weren't expecting that from him."	Abreu had an RBI double in the bottom of the eighth to trim the deficit before Jansen's two-run shot off lefty Jace Fry in the ninth.	"It was big," Montoyo said of Jansen's homer. "Even more so against this club. Because they don't quit. They've got a good offense."	FINDING A GROOVE	Guerrero isn't the only Blue Jays rookie to rebound from a slow start. Thornton earned his first win in the majors in his previous start and has allowed three runs and six hits in 11 2/3 innings in his past two starts.	"I've just been doing a better job executing pitches," the 25-year-old right-hander said. "I've been doing a better job working ahead in counts and locating pitches. As long as I can continue that, I feel pretty confident in my stuff and being able to get guys out."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: LHP Clayton Richard (stress reaction, right knee) allowed no runs and no hits in 3 1/3 innings on Saturday in a rehab start for Triple-A Buffalo. He threw 48 pitches (31 strikes), struck out four and walked two.	White Sox: OF Eloy Jimenez (high right ankle sprain) was 7 for 22 (.318) with a homer and RBI in five rehab games with Triple-A Charlotte entering Sunday. No decision has been on when Chicago's top prospect will rejoin the team. "We're just making sure he's healthy," manager Rick Renteria said. "I'm sure you'll see him with us shortly."	UP NEXT	Blue Jays: RHP Edwin Jackson (0-0, 3.60 ERA) makes his second start for Toronto on Monday afternoon in the opener of a four-game series against Boston. LHP David Price (1-2, 3.75) goes for the Red Sox.	White Sox: They have not named a starter Monday night for the opener of a four-game series at Houston and likely will go with a bullpen day. Chicago was winless in seven games last season against the Astros, who will start RHP Brad Peacock (4-2, 4.01 ERA).	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Texas Rangers manager Chris Woodward hadn't planned on using Danny Santana, a day after he was hit in the right ankle by a fastball from Carlos Martinez and forced to make an early exit.	But Woodward learned 40 minutes before gametime Sunday that Santana said he was totally fine. Good enough, certainly, to be a pinch-hitter.	Santana delivered, connecting for a pinch-hit home run in the eighth inning and then scoring the winning run in the 10th on a sacrifice fly by Nomar Mazara off Martinez that lifted Texas over the St. Louis Cardinals 5-4.	"The kid is pretty special, to take 97 in the ankle off the bone and come in and hit a pinch-hit homer the next day and have a huge walk the next at-bat -- says a lot about who he is," Woodward said.	The Rangers rallied for two runs in the 10th and won for the fourth time in five games. The Cardinals dropped their fifth straight series and haven't won consecutive games since taking five in a row from April 27-May 1.	Santana said through a translator that he was one of the first players in the clubhouse on Sunday morning, took treatment, had his ankle taped and declared himself available.	Santana said that after running from first base to third in the 10th inning on the game-tying single by pinch-hitter Willie Calhoun, he knew he could run home if need be.	Both teams blew leads in the late innings.	Dexter Fowler's solo homer in the ninth off Texas reliever Chris Martin made it 3-all.	The Cardinals went ahead in the 10th when Harrison Bader doubled off Jeanmar Gomez (1-0) and scored on a sacrifice fly by Paul DeJong.	Rougned Odor opened the Texas 10th with a single off Jordan Hicks (1-2), Santana walked and Calhoun had a tying single.	Hicks threw 39 pitches, the most of his two-year major league career.	Cardinals manager Mike Shildt, who was ejected in the fourth by plate umpire Jeremie Rehak after Fowler was called out on a 3-2 pitch, said he had no issue with Hicks' workload.	"We knew he had a count at 40 we were going to hold pretty firm to," Shildt said.	Martinez, the two-time All-Star who made his season debut Saturday following shoulder trouble, entered and intentionally walked Shin-Soo Choo to load the bases with no outs. After Logan Forsythe struck out, Mazara lofted a flyball that scored Santana.	Paul DeJong drove in three runs for the Cardinals.	St. Louis starter Jack Flaherty gave up two runs on four hits with two walks and five strikeouts in six innings. Choo led off the first with a home run.	Rangers starter Drew Smyly sought his first win since Sept. 13, 2016, having missed the next two major league seasons following Tommy John surgery. He pitched four innings, allowing two runs in the first.	ANYWHERE, ANYTIME	Jose Leclerc, who has been everything from a closer to an opener for Texas this season, matched a career high for strikeouts in a game with five while pitching the fifth and sixth innings. Leclerc has 23 strikeouts in his last 12 1/3 innings, including all three batters as the opener on Friday.	Woodward said he'll return Leclerc to the closer's role later this season but currently sees him as "our version of Andrew Miller back in the Cleveland days."	SHORT HOPS	Calhoun has hit safely in all five games since being recalled from Triple-A Nashville on Wednesday and is hitting .476 (10 for 21). ... Choo's home run landed in the upper deck in right field and was his third homer in his past four games. The homer was the first run scored off Flaherty in the first or second inning in his 10 starts this season. ... Yadier Molina had his third stolen base of the season on the back end of a double steal, tying him for the most by a major league catcher this year.	UP NEXT	Cardinals: RHP Michael Wacha (3-1, 4.93 ERA) will make his fifth career start against the Kansas City Royals on Tuesday and his first at home. Wacha is 3-1 with a 2.56 ERA against Kansas City.	Rangers: LHP Mike Minor (4-3, 2.61 ERA) will open a home series against the Seattle Mariners on Monday. Minor has five starts of seven or more innings pitched with two or fewer runs this season, already the most by a Ranger during the past two seasons.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

PHOENIX --  Pablo Sandoval and Brandon Crawford, two of San Francisco's oldest players, did not start Sunday's game.	By the time it was over, they had made the two biggest plays, allowing the Giants to leave the desert with a series win.	Sandoval opened the 10th inning with a pinch-hit homer after Crawford made a game-saving stop at shortstop in the ninth, helping the Giants beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 3-2.	"You have to be prepared for everything, that's the No. 1 rule," Sandoval said. "You have to be ready and take advantage of your opportunity."	The Giants opened the three-game series with a loss Friday night, but rallied for two wins with plenty of help from the 32-year-old Sandoval.	Kung Fu Panda had a pinch-hit solo homer in San Francisco's 8-5 win Saturday and sat on the bench Sunday, waiting for his turn again.	It came in the 10th against Yoshihisa Hirano (1-2). Down two strikes, Sandoval looked for a pitch he could hit hard and got it, sending an outside fastball over the wall in left.	Sandoval has 40 RBI at Chase Field, his most in any opposing ballpark.	"It's amazing what he's doing," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "You just expect good things to happen, the way he's been."	The Giants scored two runs off Robbie Ray in the third, but went 20 straight at-bats without a baserunner until Mac Williamson walked with two outs in the ninth. Sandoval's hit was San Francisco's first since Donovan Solano's single with no outs in the third.	Will Smith struck out the side for his 12th save in 12 opportunities.	Crawford made it all possible.	The Diamondbacks appeared to have the game won when Adam Jones hit a grounder into the shortstop hole off Sam Dyson (2-0) with a runner on third with two outs in the ninth.	Crawford showed he's still got good range at 32, diving to his right and hopping up to make a throw that beat Jones by a step to save the Giants.	"Crawford has been doing that for a long time to a lot of guys," said Arizona manager Torey Lovullo, whose team finished with three hits. "Just kind of stabbed us there and I felt that momentum shift over their way, especially when that solo home run happened."	Ray had been on a roll, entering 3-0 with a 1.98 ERA and 35 strikeouts in 35 1/3 innings. He had command issues against the Giants, needing 29 pitches just to strand runners at second and third in the first inning.	Ray walked in a run in the third and another came across on Kevin Pillar's groundout. The left-hander allowed two runs on three hits and walked four in four innings. He struck out six.	"Today they made me grind, some really good at-bats," Ray said. "I felt my fastball command was pretty good. It was just my off-speed stuff they were laying off of."	POMERANZ'S DAY	San Francisco's Drew Pomeranz was reinstated from the 10-day injured list Sunday after missing nine games with a left arm strain.	He had some control issues of his own -- two walks and a hit batter in the second inning -- but didn't give up a hit until David Peralta's leadoff infield single in the fourth.	Nick Ahmed followed with a run-scoring double and Christian Walker scored from third on a pitch that caromed off home plate umpire Joe West's mask.	Pomeranz allowed two runs on two hits and walked five in 4 2/3 innings.	"The stuff was good," Bochy said. "It was up a tick, but I thought he had good stuff and he found a way to get out of it."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: 2B Wilmer Flores left in the fourth inning after getting hit on the right foot by a pitch in the third. Ketel Marte moved from center field to second base and Jarrod Dyson entered in center. He missed Saturday's game with a left hand injury after being hit while attempting to bunt the day before. ... Peralta went 2 for 3 after being held out of Saturday's game with upper back pain.	UP NEXT	Giants: LHP Andrew Suarez will be recalled from Triple-A Sacramento to start Monday against Atlanta. He went 7-13 with a 4.49 ERA in 29 starts for the Giants last season, but did not make the rotation coming out of spring training this year.	Diamondbacks: RHP Luke Weaver is 3-0 with a 0.98 ERA in his past three road starts heading into Monday's game against San Diego.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Danny Duffy had a rooting section on the road and gave his pals plenty to cheer about.	The veteran left-hander from California won his third straight start and the Kansas City Royals stopped a four-game skid Sunday with a 5-1 victory over the Los Angeles Angels.	Hunter Dozier hit a two-run double to back Duffy (3-1), who allowed five hits over six effective innings for his first victory at Angel Stadium. He had about 40 friends and family members in attendance and said he appreciated everyone who made the 3 1/2-hour drive to support him. Duffy is from Lompoc, about 200 miles north of Anaheim.	His father, Dan, was on hand as part of the team trip for Royals dads.	"This state hasn't been good to me in my career," Duffy said with a chuckle. "It was nice to finally get a win in California. The Angels have always done a good job making me throw a lot of pitches. Today, I was able to make pitches when I needed to and get quick outs at times. It meant a lot for me to get a win here. I had a lot of people here and from my hometown. That helped me a lot, for sure. It was nice to hear familiar voices when I was coming off the field."	Duffy worked out of trouble in the first inning before settling in. He struck out five and walked three.	A trio of Royals relievers combined for three scoreless innings to close it out. Kansas City had lost six of seven.	"I felt I threw the ball pretty well. Early on, I was a little more wild than I wanted to be," Duffy said. "I was able to make pitches when I needed to. I threw my heater well, for the most part, and I was pleased with that."	Kansas City scored three runs in the third to take the lead. Adalberto Mondesi's single to right sent Whit Merrifield to third and he scored on Kole Calhoun's error. Dozier's two-out double made it 3-0.	"It was kind of one that was in that grey area -- maybe I would have a chance to get to it. If I miss it, we're in trouble," Calhoun said. "So I decided to check up on that and it kind of skipped away from me. That's a big part of the game right there. It led to a big inning for them. It's something you really never want to happen. I thought it bounced a little different."	Mike Trout had two hits for the Angels, including a first-inning double that gave him an extra-base hit in three consecutive games. He appears to be finding his swing and timing. A day earlier, he hit his 250th career home run.	Trout and Kevan Smith were each on base three times. Smith's run-scoring double in the fourth scored Calhoun.	In the sixth, Duffy was hit in the lower left leg by Tommy La Stella's comebacker. Royals manager Ned Yost and a trainer went out to check on Duffy, but he stayed in the game. He retired the next batter to end the inning and was done for the day after 106 pitches.	Tyler Skaggs (4-4) struck out seven and allowed four runs -- three earned -- on 110 pitches in 5 2/3 innings. He needed 24 pitches to get through a scoreless first inning and threw 72 pitches over the first three.	A struggling Chris Owings had an RBI single in the sixth to make it 4-1 and chase Skaggs.	SNAP OUT OF IT	Backup catcher Cam Gallagher singled off Angels reliever Noe Ramirez in the ninth to halt an 0-for-22 slide.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals: 1B Lucas Duda (back) is getting closer to a rehab assignment.

SAN DIEGO --  Joe Musgrove of the Pittsburgh Pirates is undefeated against his hometown San Diego Padres.	Musgrove pitched well enough to survive a rough seventh inning and Colin Moran had a three-run home run and four RBI for the Pirates, who won 6-4 Sunday to take three of four.	"I love it," Musgrove said of pitching at Petco Park, some 15 miles from where he grew up in suburban El Cajon. "I love pitching regardless, but getting to do it in my own stadium at home, in front of my family and friends always elevates my game. I'm bummed I wasn't able to get out of the seventh clean but I still feel really good about how I threw the ball."	Musgrove (3-4) was the second straight alum of Grossmont High to beat the Padres. Steven Brault won Saturday night in relief of opener Montana DuRapau. Musgrove graduated from Grossmont in 2011 and Brault in 2010.	"We had our coaches out there today and a lot of family and friends from the area," said Musgrove, who is 2-0 against the Padres after also beating them here last season. "For me and him to both snag wins in San Diego is pretty cool. I think everyone out there is pretty proud of Grossmont."	The big right-hander took a one-hit shutout into the seventh before the Padres broke out for four runs, the big blow coming on Hunter Renfroe's three-run homer.	Greg Garcia, who played at Valhalla High in El Cajon, was the first Padres baserunner to reach second against Musgrove when he hit a leadoff double. He scored on a single by Alex Dickerson, who played at suburban Poway High.	With one out, Eric Hosmer hit a comebacker and Musgrove tried to go to second but his throw was wide for an error. Renfroe followed with a shot into the Padres' bullpen beyond the left-center fence, his 11th, to pull the Padres to 5-4.	Moran got his fourth RBI in the eighth when he drove in Bryan Reynolds, who doubled.	Musgrove retired his first six batters and didn't allow a hit until Hosmer singled to left leading off the fifth. He allowed four runs, three earned, and four hits in 6 1/3 innings, with four strikeouts and one walk.	"Joe probably had one decision he'd like to take back as far as location of a pitch," manager Clint Hurdle said. "Had a play in front of him to make, maybe get an out at first, that could have changed the direction of the inning as well, but he's so athletic sometimes, what makes you laugh makes you cry. That's the outing we wanted from him. The three-run homer maybe puts a dent in the numbers but his drive, direction, and conviction to pitch out there sets the tone for a lot of things that happened afterward.	"Moran has a big day at the plate. Drives in four runs. Every day somebody new stepping in and doing something significant," the skipper said.	Musgrove said everything was working well for him.	"It's kind of unfortunate I let things get away from me there in that last inning but I felt I was still making pitches. The one I'd take back obviously is the cutter to Renfroe. Maybe I go to first base with Hosmer's ball instead of second base. Overall, I think I threw the ball well."	Padres manager Andy Green said Musgrove "attacks well, uses multiple pitches and pitches to multiple locations. You look up and you put a four-spot on him, that's not a bad thing at the end of the day."	Felipe Vazquez pitched the ninth for his 13th save.	After a 26-minute rain delay, Moran's homer off rookie Cal Quantrill (0-2) with two outs in the first inning helped stake Musgrove to a 4-0 lead before he threw a pitch. It was Pittsburgh's fourth hit in a span of six batters. Josh Bell, who homered twice in Saturday night's win, was aboard on an RBI single and rookie Reynolds, who homered Friday and Saturday nights, also singled ahead of Moran's homer.	Moran added an RBI single in the eighth off Robbie Erlin.	Quantrill was recalled from Triple-A El Paso to make the spot start, his third this season. He allowed five runs and eight hits in five innings, struck out two and walked two.	Quantrill said it was a matter of "just falling behind too many guys early in the game, making it too difficult. I survived it the first couple of games and came back to bite me. I've really got to figure out the first inning."	UP NEXT	Pirates: RHP Chris Archer (1-3, 5.58) is scheduled to start Tuesday night in the opener of a three-game home series against Colorado.	Padres: Rookie RHP Chris Paddack (3-2, 1.99) is scheduled to start the opener of a three-game home series against Arizona on Monday night. He's coming off his worst start, when he allowed season highs with five hits and six runs, although only three were earned.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

MINNEAPOLIS -- — The Minnesota Twins welcomed their fans back to the ballpark by hitting like they wanted to give them all souvenirs.	Though Target Field was at coronavirus-limited capacity, the Twins played like the place was full.	Mitch Garver, Byron Buxton and Luis Arraez hit home runs to back another strong start by José Berríos, and the Twins beat the Seattle Mariners 10-2 on Thursday.	Berríos (2-0), who no-hit Milwaukee over six innings in his first turn, threw two more hitless innings before surrendering his first run of the season in the third. Pulled with two outs in the sixth, Berríos tipped his cap to the sellout crowd of 9,675 as he strutted off the mound.	“We’ve been waiting for this moment a really long time. Everybody knows here the fans are great people. They like baseball and are always cheering for us no matter what happens,” Berríos said.	Said Arraez: “They’re everything for us."	Garver had the three-run shot that got the Twins going in their home opener, a straightaway screamer to center field that landed in the living wall of junipers for a 3-1 lead in the third inning against Mariners starter Marco Gonzales (0-1).	The Twins, whose only two losses have been 10th-inning walk-offs, wound up with a season-high 16 hits. Buxton went 3 for 5, Arraez drove in three runs, and Andrelton Simmons had two of the team's six doubles.	Gonzales didn't finish the fifth. He allowed nine hits and was charged with seven runs to balloon his ERA to 10.45.	Ty France had two hits and José Marmolejos homered off Berríos, but the Mariners couldn't keep up with the two-time AL Central champions.	“Frustrating, to say the least,” Gonzales said.	TAKE ME OUT	With seating socially distanced and limited by the state to about 25% capacity, the Twins played their warmest home opener — 67 degrees — for a season that started on time since Target Field opened in 2010. Last year, their first home game was on July 28, a 60-game schedule played with the gates closed due to the pandemic.	The afternoon just about had it all for the folks who snagged tickets, including a 16-minute rain delay. Former Twins manager Ron Gardenhire tossed out the ceremonial first pitch to his son Toby Gardenhire, now the manager of the Triple-A affiliate St. Paul Saints. An “MVP” chant was fired up for Buxton, who batted in the cleanup spot and has three doubles and four homers in six games.	Berríos picked off two runners, the first Twins pitcher to do so since Kyle Gibson in 2016. Designated hitter Nelson Cruz beat out a slow roller for an infield single, taking first base in the sixth inning with a big grin.	“It felt like there were a lot of people in the stands, I’ll be honest with you, and for us to go out there and play a nice ballgame for them makes it all the better,” manager Rocco Baldelli said.	STRUGGLING STARTER	Gonzales, who started on opening day for the Mariners and gave up five runs in six innings to San Francisco, was awfully hittable again.	“He’s as good of a competitor as we have in here, and he will grind it out and certainly get better next time,” manager Scott Servais said. “We’re all trying to help him figure it out right now.”	BIG PLANS	The Twins were set to have COVID-19 shots available for players and key staff after the game, with Major League Baseball seeking an 85% vaccination rate before relaxing virus protocols.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: LHP James Paxton was seeking a second opinion on his MRI test results after a strained left forearm limited him to 24 pitches in his first start on Tuesday. MLB Network reported that Tommy John surgery was recommended for Paxton, but Servais said after the game he hadn't been informed of that. ... 1B Evan White, removed from the game on Wednesday with tightness in his left quadriceps, was out of the lineup but could avoid the injured list, Servais said.	Twins: 3B Josh Donaldson (mild right hamstring strain), who is eligible to come off the injured list on Monday, has been a batting practice “machine” and a “treadmill monster,” Baldelli said, without committing to a return date. “Trying to edge your way back while playing Major League Baseball while not at 100 percent with a muscle injury is a very, very dangerous thing.”	UP NEXT	Mariners: LHP Yusei Kikuchi (0-0, 4.50 ERA) will pitch on Saturday, following the customary weather-contingency off day.	Twins: RHP Michael Pineda (1-0, 0.00 ERA) takes the mound for the middle game of the series.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

WASHINGTON --  The Chicago Cubs had watched most of their five-run lead against the Washington Nationals dissipate by the time Steve Cishek entered Sunday night's game in the seventh inning.	Cishek closed it out, pitching 2 1/3 scoreless innings for his fourth save as the Cubs held on for a 6-5 win.	"He's the first guy in line at Dairy Queen," Cubs manager Joe Maddon joked afterward. "That is above and beyond. I was planning on two innings, but then he had to go (get) an extra out."	Chicago led 6-1 before Washington closed to within one on a three-run homer by Anthony Rendon in the sixth inning and a solo home run by Howie Kendrick in the seventh.	Cishek retired Rendon with a man on to end the seventh and allowed a single in the eighth before a 1-2-3 ninth. That all came after the reliever spoke with pitching coach Tommy Hottovy, who told Cishek they might need him to throw a couple of innings.	"Jokingly, I told him (I could go) four innings," Cishek said after his longest outing since May 2012. "Good thing that didn't happen."	Anthony Rizzo homered and Albert Almora Jr. had three hits for the Cubs, who took two of three from the Nationals and improved to 10-1-1 in their past 12 series.	Kyle Hendricks (4-4) retired the first 11 Washington batters and didn't allow a hit until Kurt Suzuki's single leading off the fifth, but gave up four runs and six hits in 5 2/3 innings. Hendricks had been masterful in May, allowing just one earned run over his past three starts (25 innings).	"Not a good mental approach kind of from the start," he said. "Wasn't attacking as well as I have been the last few games and fastball command kind of suffered from there."	Washington starter Jeremy Hellickson (2-3) allowed three runs and four hits with three walks in three innings.	Rizzo's solo homer in the third gave the Cubs a 3-0 lead, and Chicago went up 4-0 in the fourth on Kyle Schwarber's sacrifice fly. The Cubs scored two more in the sixth to take a 6-1 lead. They had numerous chances to increase their lead in the early innings, but went 1 for 11 with runners in scoring position and left nine men on base -- leaving the door open for Washington.	"The boys are swinging the bat well," Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. "And they faced a guy that came in here pitching really, really well and we were able to knock him out of the game."	Before the game, Maddon announced that the Cubs dropped their protest over the pitching delivery of Washington reliever Sean Doolittle in Saturday night's game.	FRIENDLY CONFINES	Rizzo is hitting .315 in 108 career at-bats at Nationals Park, with seven homers and 16 RBI.	NATS STATS	Gerardo Parra had three hits. ... Rendon is 10 for 23 over his past six games with two homers, nine RBI and eight runs scored. ... CF Victor Robles made a leaping catch at the wall in right center to take an extra-base hit away from Addison Russell in the ninth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: SS Javier Baez left in the sixth inning. He said he jammed his right heel while fielding a grounder by Hellickson in the third and hopes to play Monday.	Nationals: Robles was back in the lineup after being hit on the left wrist with a pitch Friday night and missing Saturday night's game. ... RHP Trevor Rosenthal (viral infection) will pitch an inning for Double-A Harrisburg on Monday and then be re-evaluated. ... 1B Matt Adams (left shoulder strain) has begun swinging a bat and could take batting practice on the field Monday.	UP NEXT	Cubs: RHP Yu Darvish (2-3, 5.14) starts the opener of a three-game series against former Cub Jake Arrieta and the visiting Philadelphia Phillies.	Nationals: LHP Patrick Corbin (4-1, 2.91) makes his fourth start of the season against the New York Mets in the opener of a four-gamer series at Citi Field. He is 1-0 with a 2.70 ERA and 24 strikeouts in three starts vs. New York.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

TORONTO --  David Price returned to the Boston Red Sox with another outstanding performance against Toronto Blue Jays.	The 33-year-old left-hander did not allow any earned runs over five innings in a 12-2 rout Monday that improved his record against the Blue Jays to 22-3, including 13-1 in 18 starts at Toronto.	"I enjoy this mound," he said. "It feels close to home plate, so it's just one of the places I enjoy throwing."	Price (2-2) had not pitched since May 2 due to left elbow tendinitis. He allowed three hits, struck out four and walked none.	Toronto scored twice in the second to tie the game after second baseman Michael Chavis allowed Billy McKinney's two-hop grounder to bounce out of his glove for an error with one out. Richard Urena grounded out and Luke Maile, who had been 0 for 7 against Price in his career, drove a fastball over the wall in left-center for his second homer this year.	Price then retired his final 10 batters.	"I felt better as the game went on," he said. "The last couple innings were more efficient than the first two or three, so it was good."	Manager Alex Cora removed Price after just 67 pitches.	"Hasn't pitched in a while, so just take care of him," Cora.  "Pitch count was low. The effort was great. The last two innings velocity-wise, location-wise was fun to watch."	Brandon Workman, Heath Hembree, Ryan Brasier and Hector Velazquez combining for hitless relief.	Chavis, Jackie Bradley Jr., Xander Bogaerts and Rafael Devers homered for Boston, which started a seven-day trip to Toronto and Houston. The World Series champions are 23-14 since a 2-8 start.	Bogaerts and Devers hit consecutive second-deck home runs in the ninth off Ryan Tepera, the third time the Red Sox have gone back-to-back this season. Bogaerts and Devers had three RBI each.	Bogaerts hit a tiebreaking, two-run single in a four-run third that included Chavis' ninth home run this season, a two-run drive. Bradley's two-run homer in the sixth against Elvis Luciano boosted the lead to 8-2, Bradley's first home run since Game 3 of the World Series and his first in the regular season since last Sept. 20.	"You see a bit of a glimpse of what we're capable of," Chavis said. "I wouldn't even say we're hot yet, but things are going the right way, for sure, and being part of those innings, it's definitely something fun."	In his second start with the Blue Jays, Edwin Jackson (0-1) gave up six runs -- five earned -- and seven hits in five innings. Toronto is the record 14th big league team for the 35-year-old right-hander.	Just one Toronto batter reached after the second, Freddy Galvis with a leadoff walk in the seventh. Toronto is batting a major league-low .218, and the Blue Jays gave up a season-high 12 runs.	"The Red Sox are one of the best teams in baseball," Toronto manager Charlie Montoyo said. "Early on in the game, we didn't make a couple of plays, and they took advantage. That's what good teams do."	TWO-SPORT STAR	Toronto forward Jozy Altidore threw out the ceremonial first pitch. Altidore, announced Monday to the United States' 40-man preliminary Gold Cup roster, has not played for the Americans since the October 2017 loss at Trinidad and Tobago that ended a streak of seven straight World Cup appearances for the U.S.	BASHING BOSTON	Maile has hit four of his 10 career home runs against the Red Sox.	GUERRERO	While many of the 26,794 on hand were disappointed that Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was not in the starting lineup owing to a scheduled day off, the rookie appreciates the time off, having missed most of spring training with an oblique injury. "We're just being careful," he said.	MOVES	Red Sox: C  Oscar Hernandez and RHP Josh Smith were optioned to Triple-A Pawtucket after Sunday's win over Houston. C Sandy Leon was activated from paternity leave and Price from the 10-day IL.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: 2B Eric Sogard (sprained left thumb) was a late scratch from the starting. Urena moved to second and McKinney replaced Urena in left field. . Manager Charlie Montoyo said RHP Ken Giles (wrist) was not available. .... After a rehab start for Triple-A Buffalo on Saturday, LHP Clayton Richard (knee) is likely to make his season debut on Thursday.	UP NEXT	LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (4-2, 4.89), who takes the mound on Tuesday for the Red Sox, is 4-0 with a 3.46 ERA in his last seven starts, and hasn't given up a home run in a career-best five straight starts. Toronto RHP Marcus Stroman (1-6, 2.95) is 4-3 with a 3.87 ERA in 12 starts against Boston.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

CLEVELAND --  Brett Anderson had a quick reaction when the baseball and both pieces of a broken bat came sailing at him in the fifth inning.	Get out of the way.	Oakland's left-hander managed to do that, but left the game in the following inning with a cervical strain, and the Athletics hung on to beat the Cleveland Indians 6-4 on Monday.	Anderson (5-3) allowed one run in 5 1/3 innings, improving to 4-0 with a 0.94 ERA in six starts against the Indians. The 31-year-old left-hander was injured in the fifth inning when he ducked to avoid a ball hit up the middle by Roberto Perez. Anderson also had to watch the bat, which broke when Perez made contact.	Anderson has had arm injuries throughout his career, including being sidelined twice last season.	"Kind of another fluky thing where I only have to deal with when I break a guy's bat and I don't know where the barrel is going," he said.	Anderson finished the inning, then was removed in the sixth with a 3-1 lead and a runner on second. He is dealing with soreness and stiffness, but said he should be fine going forward.	"My range of motion going to the inside part of the plate was limited," he said. "It was one of those things where I can get out of it when it's not too bad. I felt that was the right moment."	Manager Bob Melvin and a team trainer visited the mound in both the fifth and sixth, and Anderson walked to the dugout on the second occasion.	"He's all right," Melvin said. "When the bat broke and went back over him, he kind of snapped his neck a little bit so we will see how he is tomorrow. Up to that point he was really good."	Jurickson Profar, Matt Olson and Matt Chapman homered as Oakland extended its winning streak to four, matching its season high. The A's have won seven of their last 10 games against the Indians.	Jose Ramirez hit an RBI single in the eighth off Lou Trivino that pulled Cleveland to 4-3, and Blake Treinen retired Carlos Gonzalez on an inning-ending groundout with the bases loaded.	Chapman hit a two-run homer off Tyler Clippard in the ninth. Francisco Lindor had a two-out homer in the bottom half, and Treinen retired Jason Kipnis on a groundout for his eighth save in 10 chances.	Profar and Olson homered off Carlos Carrasco (4-4), who allowed three runs, seven hits and two walks, throwing 100 pitches in five innings.	Profar's homer in the second was the first run Carrasco allowed in 13 innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: OF Khris Davis was out of the lineup because of a sore left hip, an injury that caused him to miss games from May 9-11. He was out of the lineup Saturday and returned Sunday in Detroit.	Indians: RHP Corey Kluber will have an X-ray on his broken right arm Thursday. He was hit by a line drive May 1. Kluber's arm has been in a cast, which could be fitted with a removable splint depending on the results of the X-ray.	LOT OF PITCHES	Carrasco was coming off two dominant performances against the Chicago White Sox, but admitted he didn't have his best stuff Monday. The right-hander knew his high pitch count would lead to a short outing.	"I wanted to go deep in the game so we wouldn't have to use our bullpen too much," he said. "I started worrying when I saw like 70 pitches in the third inning."	HOT CORNER	In addition to hitting a home run, Chapman took a hit away from Kipnis at third with a backhand grab in the first and added a couple of other solid defensive plays.	"You hit it to third, you're out," Indians manager Terry Francona said. "That kid's special."	STREAK STOPPER	Oakland could have a five-game winning streak, but their contest in Detroit on Sunday was suspended due to rain with the Athletics leading 5-3 going into the bottom of the seventh. The game will resume Sept. 6 before the Tigers play a series in Oakland	UP NEXT	Athletics: RHP Chris Bassitt (2-1 1.93 ERA) has the AL's third-lowest ERA among pitchers with 30 or more innings. Bassitt is a Toledo native and played at the University of Akron.	Indians: RHP Trevor Bauer (4-2, 3.76 ERA) got a no-decision against Baltimore in his last start, but allowed seven runs -- matching a career high -- in five innings.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

BALTIMORE --  Late in the game with the outcome still not quite decided, the New York Yankees played up to their reputation.	At the same time, the Baltimore Orioles put all their youth and inexperience on full display.	Gary Sanchez hit a three-run homer in the ninth inning to cap a New York rally fueled by Baltimore gaffes, and the Yankees pulled out a 10-7 victory Monday night.	Gleyber Torres homered twice for New York, which trailed 6-1 after four innings and 7-3 after six.	"We are Yankees. We have a history, you know what I mean?" Torres said. "We want to go to the championship, the World Series, for sure. So we just prepare mentally right now and try to win and be positive."	The rebuilding Orioles looked pretty good for six innings. Then, they fulfilled their stature as the team with the worst record in the AL. They threw to the wrong base, missed popups and were outscored 7-0 over the final three innings.	New York scored in the seventh on an overthrow by left fielder Dwight Smith Jr., who fell for a fake tag-up on third base. In the ninth, right fielder Joey Rickard threw to the wrong base on a single, Smith heaved the ball past the plate on Aaron Hicks' tying sacrifice fly as Cameron Maybin took third, catcher Pedro Severino misjudged a foul pop that preceded a two-out walk to Luke Voit and Sanchez connected off Mychal Givens (0-1).	"We just did some things the last couple innings that allowed extra base runners, allowed runners to move up," manager Brandon Hyde said.	Zach Britton (2-0) worked the eighth and Aroldis Chapman got three outs for his 12th save, ending by striking out Jonathan Villar with a 101 mph fastball.	New York's third straight comeback win, sandwiched around a defeat on Saturday, was led by Torres. The shortstop is 17 for 35 against the Orioles with three multihomer games, and eight of his 10 home runs have come against Baltimore. Sanchez hit seven of his 13 versus the Orioles, who have allowed a major league-leading 97.	Hanser Alberto and Renato Nunez homered for the Orioles. Subbing in the leadoff spot for the slumping Villar, Alberto moved within a triple of hitting for the cycle by the fourth inning. He doubled in the first, added his third home run in the third and added an RBI single in the fourth.	After hitting a fly ball in the sixth, Alberto got his career-high fourth hit before Villar entered as pinch runner.	It was all for naught.	"There was a good vibe, you know, even though obviously it wasn't going our way early and we were down big," Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. "It was kind that theme in the dugout, just chip away at this."	Orioles starter Andrew Cashner allowed three runs over six gritty innings, and ended up watching Baltimore absorb another defeat and fall to 15-32.	"To me this is the toughest one of the season for sure," he said.	Not all the mistakes were made by Baltimore. Voit aided the Orioles when he allowed Trey Mancini's foul pop to drop near first in the sixth inning and Mancini followed with a sacrifice fly.	Yankees starter J.A. Happ allowed six runs and a pair of solo homers in 3 2/3 innings, but New York's comeback got him a no-decision. In four starts against Baltimore this season, the lefty has a 7.79 ERA. He has given up 13 homers in 10 starts.	ROAD TRIP	Mechanical issues with the Yankees' plane to Baltimore following a home weekend series against Tampa Bay forced the club to call an audible, with most of the team making the trip down the I-95 corridor Sunday by bus.	"Myself and a few coaches ended up taking a train down," Boone said. "I think the bus ride was another one of those of those bonding experiences that guys have as players."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees:  SS Didi Gregorius played five innings at extended spring training in his first game action since Tommy John surgery on Oct. 17. . 3B Miguel Andujar underwent season-ending surgery to repair a right labrum tear. ... RHP Dellin Betances (right shoulder) continued his throwing program Monday, extending his throwing to 105 feet from flat ground. . OF Giancarlo Stanton (left shoulder) began his rehab assignment by hitting a solo home run for Class A Tampa on Monday night, his first game action since March 31. . SS Troy Tulowitzki (left calf), sidelined since April 3, resumed on-field batting practice Monday and continued taking grounders at shortstop and third base. . Boone said there is will be no timetable for RF Aaron Judge's return (left oblique) until he begins swinging a bat. So far he's only been running and playing catch.	Orioles: RHP Nate Karns (right forearm strain) was moved to the 60-day IL to make room on the 40-man roster for RHP Josh Lucas, whose contract was selected from Triple-A Norfolk. This is Lucas' second stint this season with Baltimore.	UP NEXT	Yankees: RHP Domingo German (8-1, 2.50 ERA) seeks to win his sixth consecutive start on Tuesday night in the second game of the series. He could join Tommy John (1979), Herb Pennock (1926) and Jack Chesbro (1904) as the only Yankees to earn nine wins by the end of May.

NEW YORK --  Once they were informed no change was imminent in the dugout, the New York Mets looked a lot more relaxed at the plate.	Amed Rosario and Pete Alonso homered in the first inning as the Mets, after learning embattled manager Mickey Callaway is staying around, broke out of their offensive funk to beat the Washington Nationals 5-3 on Monday night.	"I'm really happy that we rose to the occasion today," Alonso said. "I think he deserves to be our manager. He's a great leader and we love playing for him."	Carlos Gomez cracked an RBI double off the wall for his first Mets hit in 12 years, and Todd Frazier had a run-scoring single to help New York (21-25) stop a five-game losing streak.	After the Mets built a 4-0 lead in the third against Patrick Corbin, fill-in starter Wilmer Font and five relievers held off the rival Nationals in the opener of a four-game series.	"The at-bats were obviously way more quality," Callaway said. "Great pitcher out there, one of the best in the game, and we grinded it out."	Anthony Rendon homered again and Yan Gomes ended an 0-for-23 slump with three hits for Washington, including an RBI single. Juan Soto also singled home a run to make it 4-3 before Robert Gsellman got out of the eighth.	Corbin (4-2) was tagged for four runs and six hits over five innings. The $140 million lefty, who has faced the Mets four times in 10 starts this season, struck out 11 in a 5-1 victory against them at home last Wednesday.	"They made me battle all night," Corbin said. "They've seen me a lot. I've seen them a lot. Tonight they got me. Just made a couple mistakes, wasn't as sharp as I've been."	Pinch-hitter Dominic Smith delivered a two-out RBI single in the bottom of the eighth on the first pitch from left-hander Tony Sipp, who came off the injured list earlier in the day.	Font, pitching in place of injured Jason Vargas, was told he was starting when he arrived at the ballpark. He lasted four innings before Drew Gagnon (2-0) tossed two hitless innings. Edwin Diaz pitched out of trouble in a scoreless ninth for his 11th save in 11 tries.	"It was super important to get home and to get that first victory out of the way," Font said through a translator.	Washington dropped to 2-14 in series openers this season.	Before the game, with questions intensifying about Callaway's job security early in his second season as skipper, the Mets front office held a meeting with players and coaches to declare support for the staff.	After that, a players-only meeting was led by veterans.	"Mickey is our manager now. Mickey is our manager going forward," general manager Brodie Van Wagenen said at a news conference attended by chief operating officer Jeff Wilpon.	The Mets had lost 21 of 32 games overall, including all three at major league-worst Miami over the weekend -- becoming the first team to get swept by the lowly Marlins since 2017. New York totaled only three hits in consecutive shutouts Saturday and Sunday, the first time the club was held to two hits or fewer in consecutive games since 1967.	"We're not looking to blame a manager," Van Wagenen said. "He has our full support to lead this team for the foreseeable future."	It took all of six batters for the Mets to get three hits Monday.	Rosario's homer to straightaway center field on Corbin's fourth pitch, an 0-2 fastball, snapped a 19-inning scoreless stretch. Alonso hit his 15th home run two batters later, matching Ron Swoboda (1965) for most by a Mets rookie before the All-Star break.	"That was great," Frazier said. "Kind of came together today, talked about a few things, got a few things off our chest. We felt good going into today's game."	ON A TEAR	Rendon is 12 for 25 (.480) with three homers, five doubles, eight RBI and 10 runs in his last seven games. He has homered in two straight games and three of his past four.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: Sipp was reinstated from the 10-day IL after missing 11 games with a strained oblique. The team also designated LHP Dan Jennings for assignment and claimed RHP Javy Guerra off waivers from Toronto. The Nationals hope Guerra will join them Tuesday. ... 1B Ryan Zimmerman (plantar fascitis) felt less sore than he expected after running Sunday, according to manager Dave Martinez. Zimmerman was scheduled to do some baseball activities Monday.	Mets: Right-handed reliever Seth Lugo was placed on the 10-day IL with tendinitis in his pitching shoulder. The team selected the contract of left-hander Hector Santiago from Triple-A Syracuse and transferred infielder Jed Lowrie to the 60-day IL. ... Van Wagenen said OF Michael Conforto, on the seven-day concussion list, has been symptom-free for three days. ... Vargas (left hamstring tightness) threw 74 pitches over four-plus innings during a rehab start Sunday for Double-A Binghamton against Trenton. He allowed one run and two hits with three walks and five strikeouts. The next step for Vargas is a side session but "there's a good chance" he might not need another rehab outing before the Mets slot him back into the rotation, Callaway said.	UP NEXT	Nationals: RHP Erick Fedde (0-0, 3.38 ERA) is scheduled to make his first start of the season Tuesday night after five relief appearances. Fedde will pitch in place of injured Anibal Sanchez.	Mets: Zack Wheeler (3-3, 4.85) tries to rebound from a 7-6 loss in Washington last Thursday, when he gave up a career-high 11 hits over six innings. Wheeler is 4-10 with a 5.27 ERA in 16 starts against the Nationals, including 0-2 with a 9.77 ERA in three outings this year.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

CHICAGO --  The memories came flooding back to Jake Arrieta as the fans showered him with cheers when he stepped to the plate for the first time.	His 4 1/2 seasons in Chicago included an NL Cy Young Award in 2015, a drought-busting World Series championship in 2016, two no-hitters and an All-Star selection. There were plenty of ovations, just none quite like this.	Arrieta allowed one run over six innings in his return to Wrigley Field, J.T. Realmuto hit a solo homer in the 10th and the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Chicago Cubs 5-4 on Monday.	Realmuto connected with two outs against Kyle Ryan (0-1), driving a 1-2 fastball a few rows into the left-field seats to decide the opener of a four-game series between the NL East and Central leaders. But the night belonged to Arrieta.	He got a warm welcome on a chilly evening during the pregame introductions and was greeted with a standing ovation when he came to the plate in the third inning. He responded by tipping his helmet toward the crowd while Yu Darvish stepped away from the mound.	"It felt great," Arrieta said. "Kind of something that I experienced pretty much from Day 1 here with the fan base. Cubs fans all across the country, all across the world, they really respect and appreciate what guys are able to do here for them. It means a lot. It really does. I'll never forget this city, the fan base, the organization and everything that they did for me. It was 4 1/2 incredible years of my career."	It was a fitting reception for a pitcher who played such a huge role in turning those "Lovable Losers" into drought-busting champions. Arrieta left to sign with Philadelphia before the 2018 season. But the mark he left in Chicago won't fade anytime soon.	"I loved it," Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. "I absolutely loved it. Very happy that our fans -- which you would expect from our fans -- would acknowledge him like that. ... Jake deserved it. Absolutely."	Arrieta gave up eight hits in his first appearance at Wrigley Field since beating the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 4 of the 2017 NL Championship Series.	"It brings back a lot of memories of what we were able to do as a team, from beginning in `13 all the way through `17," Arrieta said.	Hector Neris (1-1) worked a scoreless ninth. Adam Morgan struck out Jason Heyward leading off the 10th, and Juan Nicasio earned his first save since last June 28 when he got Daniel Descalso to ground into a double play after giving up a single to Albert Almora Jr.	Philadelphia scored three runs with two outs in the sixth against Darvish for a 3-1 lead. Realmuto hit an RBI single, and Cesar Hernandez followed with a two-run triple to right that ricocheted off the side wall and bounced over Heyward's head.	The Cubs scored three in the eighth against Seranthony Dominguez. Descalso drove in two with a triple to left-center, then was rewarded home when the relay from shortstop Jean Segura ricocheted off his right foot and into Chicago's dugout.	Philadelphia tied the game in the ninth against Brad Brach when Maikel Franco doubled and came home on a two-out bloop single to right by Segura.	Darvish gave up three runs, four hits and three walks in six innings while striking out seven.	Anthony Rizzo had three hits, including an RBI single.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: Manager Gabe Kapler said RHP Vince Velasquez (right forearm strain) threw on the side Monday and will throw a bullpen session Wednesday. ... RHP Victor Arano (right elbow inflammation) will seek a second opinion after experiencing discomfort following a recent bullpen session. Kapler said Tommy John surgery "doesn't seem like the concern right now."	Cubs: SS Javier Baez (jammed right heel) sat out his first game after starting the first 44. He was hurt fielding a grounder in the third inning and exited in the sixth. ... Closer Brandon Morrow has started throwing again after experiencing a setback in his recovery from offseason elbow surgery. President of baseball operations Theo Epstein said Morrow threw from 45 to 60 feet Monday in Arizona. The Cubs shut down Morrow's rehab last month after he didn't recover well from a bullpen session. ... Epstein also said reliever Pedro Strop (strained left hamstring) threw a 25-pitch bullpen session Monday.	UP NEXT	Phillies: RHP Zach Eflin (5-4, 2.89 ERA) tries for his fourth win in five starts.	Cubs: LHP Jose Quintana (4-3, 3.68) has lost two straight starts after going 4-0 in his previous five.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  The Texas Rangers had Mike Minor on the mound and their big bats were going deep. That was just enough to hold off the Seattle Mariners.	Minor struck out 11 with only one walk and set a ballpark record for consecutive scoreless innings before leaving after six innings with 107 pitches, and Asdrubal Cabrera hit two of the five Texas homers Monday night in a 10-9 victory after having an eight-run lead.	"It wasn't until the sixth when I looked up and I saw 96. I didn't think I had that many pitches honestly," Minor said. "The way that I felt and the way I was throwing the ball, the numbers didn't reflect how I felt, I guess."	While he wanted to go deeper in the game, Minor (5-3) reached 29 innings in a row at home without giving up a run before Seattle, down 7-0 at the time, scored twice in the sixth. The lefty's scoreless streak is the longest by any pitcher ever at the Rangers' ballpark that is in its 26th and final season.	Hunter Pence, Joey Gallo and Rougned Odor also went deep as Texas matched its season high for homers for the second time in five games. The Rangers twice had back-to-back homers in a game for the first time in 10 years.	"Yeah, that's how you draw it up," manager Chris Woodward said. "You've got your best pitcher on the mound, he goes out and gives you six pretty good innings and punches out eleven, and your offense scores five in the first inning. Scores 10 in the game."	Tim Beckham had five RBI for Seattle, including his first career grand slam in the eighth to chase Shelby Miller, in his first relief appearance since losing his spot in the starting rotation. Daniel Vogelbach's two-out, two-run homer was part of a three-run ninth.	"I'm sure everyone in here feels the same way," Beckham said. "We need to win games. I don't care if it's 10-9, or care if it's 10-2. We made a good comeback, but we lost."	Texas went ahead to stay with a five-run first inning off Mike Leake (3-5), when Odor hit a three-run homer before Cabrera followed with a solo shot that snapped an 0-for-13 slide and was his first RBI in 12 games. Cabrera led off the fourth with his second homer of the game, and ninth of the season -- all at home.	Pence hit a two-run blast in the seventh, measured at about 449 feet deep into the Mariners bullpen in left-center. Gallo followed with his 14th homer, an opposite-field shot that just cleared the wall into that bullpen and made it 10-2.	Minor had a career-high 13 strikeouts at Seattle in a 15-1 win on April 27, which started the current stretch of 16 losses in 21 games for the Mariners.	"You could tell some of those guys were almost looking for the changeup at times, and the fastball was beating them," Woodward said. "So what he had done to them in the past, the last game, had something to do with what they were looking for this game."	Ryon Healy's sacrifice fly plated the first Seattle run and Beckham had a two-out RBI single before Minor struck out the last batter he faced.	Leake allowed seven runs and 11 hits over five innings. Texas tagged him for nine runs and 10 hits in five innings last month, when he was also matched against Minor.	"That's just who they are," Seattle manager Scott Servais said. "The Rangers swing the bat."	THE STREAK	Minor allowed six runs in 4 2/3 innings in the season opener for the Rangers, but didn't allow a run over 24 innings in his next three home starts. He surpassed C.J. Wilson's record of 25 2/3 consecutive scoreless innings (2009-10) at the Texas home ballpark with his first two innings against Seattle.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: Vogelbach came in the game for Healy, who left the game because of a low back strain.	UP NEXT	Mariners: Veteran lefty Tommy Milone is set to make his first start of the season for Seattle. After seven seasons with five teams, he signed a minor league deal with the Mariners in December and went 4-2 with a 3.83 ERA in nine games (eight starts) at Triple-A Tacoma.	Rangers: RHP Lance Lynn (5-3, 4.94) makes his 10th start of the season. He is 2-0 with a 2.08 ERA in two career starts against the Mariners, including April 28 when he allowed one run and five hits over seven innings at Seattle.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

HOUSTON --  The Houston Astros continued to pile up home runs on Monday night, even without their top slugger.	Jake Marisnick and Tyler White homered and Brad Peacock had another solid start to lead the Astros over the Chicago White Sox 3-0.	With George Springer, who leads the American League with 17 homers, out with a stiff back the Astros got pop from the bottom of the lineup to give them at least one homer in 17 straight games. They have 40 home runs in that span, and the two long balls Monday night helped them to their 11th win in 12 games.	"Jake has really taken off recently with getting good pitches to hit," manager AJ Hinch said. "We always feel good about whoever we have up there ... we certainly feel good about the middle of our order no matter who it is and the same thing for the bottom of the order."	Peacock (5-2) allowed two hits and fanned nine in five innings for his third straight win. He has allowed just two runs combined in his last three starts after giving up 11 combined in his previous three outings.	"He threw everything tonight where he wanted to, which is exciting for him and certainly productive for him," Hinch said. "Other than the last inning when he threw literally a third of his pitches to get through the fifth, he was in complete control. They made him really work at the end, which got him out of the game."	Ryan Pressly pitched a scoreless eighth to extend his MLB-record streak of appearances without allowing a run to 40, and Roberto Osuna gave up a hit in the ninth, preserving the shutout and earning his 12th save.	The Astros bounced back for their eighth win in a row against the White Sox after a 4-3 loss to the Red Sox on Sunday snapped a 10-game winning streak. Houston has the best record in the majors at 32-16 after going 14-4 this month.	The White Sox used five pitchers on a bullpen day which began with Ryan Burr (1-1), who had made 22 relief appearances in two seasons with the team, but whose last start came at Arizona State on Feb. 23, 2014. He allowed one hit and one run -- which was unearned, in two innings.	Despite the loss White Sox manager Rick Renteria was pleased that his pitchers performed well enough that it didn't leave the bullpen overtaxed for the rest of the four-game series.	"A starter gives you six innings and (gives up) three runs, it's a quality start," he said. "So today our bullpen gave us nine innings of three-run ball; it's a quality start for the bullpen."	Burr walked Alex Bregman with one out in the first before a single by Michael Brantley. Right fielder Charlie Tilson made an error on Brantley's hit to allow Bregman to reach third. The Astros took a 1-0 lead when Bregman scored on a sacrifice fly by Carlos Correa.	Jace Fry took over for Burr to start the third and Marisnick sent his first pitch sailing over the seats in left field for his fifth homer to make it 2-0.	Jose Ruiz was pitching with one out in the fourth when White's first home run of the season pushed the lead to 3-0.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: INF Aledmys Diaz is expected to return on Tuesday after missing the last two games with a sore left hamstring. ... 2B Jose Altuve, who has been out since May 10 with a strained left hamstring, took batting practice on the field on Monday and could be headed for a rehabilitation assignment soon. ... Springer, who left Sunday's game with stiffness in his lower back, had an MRI on Monday which was negative, and Hinch said he should return in a day or two.	White Sox: OF Eloy Jimenez was reinstated from the 10-day injured list before Monday's game, taking the roster spot of OF Nicky Delmonico, who was optioned to Triple-A Charlotte on Sunday. Jimenez has been on the injured list since April 28 after sustaining a high ankle sprain two days earlier.	HOME SWEET HOME	Houston's win on Monday gives the team a 17-4 record at home, which is the best home winning percentage in the majors.	OSUNA'S SAVES	Osuna has converted all of his save opportunities this season and has converted 24 straight since he was traded to the Astros last summer, which is tied with Brad Lidge (2005) for the longest streak in franchise history.	UP NEXT	White Sox: RHP Dylan Covey (0-2, 4.41 ERA) will start for Chicago on Tuesday. Covey did not factor in the decision after allowing two hits and two runs in 5 2/3 innings against Toronto in his last start.	Astros: RHP Justin Verlander (7-1, 2.38) is scheduled to start for Houston on Tuesday. Verlander yielded two hits and one run in seven innings against Detroit for his third straight win the last time out.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

SAN FRANCISCO --  The calendar hasn't hit June, and Atlanta pitcher Mike Soroka is already fielding questions about the All-Star game.	The Braves rookie right-hander had his season delayed by a shoulder injury suffered working out in spring training. There will be plenty of time for All-Star talk, but the way Soroka is pitching a strong case could be made.	Soroka carried a perfect game into the sixth inning, Ronald Acuna Jr. homered twice and Atlanta beat the San Francisco Giants 4-1 Monday night.	"I'm really just trying to put one foot in front of the other and make every start," Soroka said. "All-Star break's a long ways away and a lot of starts to go until then. I'm just going to keep doing what I've been doing. If that happens it'll be unbelievable (but) that's something that's not even worth thinking about right now."	Soroka (5-1) struck out seven and allowed one run and two hits in eight innings. The right-hander has allowed one earned run or fewer in all seven starts this season. His ERA rose from 0.98 to 1.01.	The 21-year-old Soroka retired the first 15 batters with relative ease before Brandon Crawford led off the sixth inning by hitting the first pitch to straightaway center field for a homer.	It was the first home run allowed by Soroka since he made his major league debut on May 1, 2018, a streak of 61 1/3 innings.	"The way he keeps pitching is something else," Braves manager Brian Snitker said. "The maturity shows. It's really impressive watching him work. He's one of those guys, you don't know if he's five up, five down or what the score is. He just keeps pitching and making pitches."	Atlanta second baseman Ozzie Albies helped preserve Soroka's gem, making a running catch with his back to the infield on a fly ball to short center field by Kevin Pillar that ended the fifth inning.	Sean Newcomb retired three batters for his first major league save.	Austin Riley also homered for the Braves, who won the opener of a seven-game trip and have won eight of 11.	"It's nice because we have such a nice blend of young players and veterans," Acuna said through a translator. "It's nice to be a part of that. I'm just trying to focus on winning. That's really the most important thing that we're all striving to achieve."	Acuna homered leading off the game against San Francisco starter Andrew Suarez (0-1). It's the 10th leadoff home run of Acuna's career and second in as many games this season. Acuna also homered leading off Sunday's 10-inning 3-2 loss to Milwaukee.	Acuna homered again in the seventh off Nick Vincent. Atlanta is 8-2 since Acuna was moved into the leadoff spot on May 10.	"I don't know what it is but he's just kind of a different guy there," Snitker said. "There's something about that spot there that he kind of comes alive."	Riley's two-run home run came off Suarez in the sixth, following a walk to Nick Markakis.	Suarez allowed three runs and four hits in six innings in his debut. The left-hander, who was called up from Triple-A Sacramento before the game, walked four and struck out five.	Suarez's only career win came against Atlanta on May 6, 2018.	"He was a strike away from a great start," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "He lost Markakis and then had the next hitter 0-2 and just hung a breaking ball. He gave us a chance to win the game, but offensively, we just got completely shut down."	PAGING PABLO	The Giants played without a true backup shortstop after the team optioned infielder Donovan Solano to Sacramento to make room for Suarez. Manager Bruce Bochy indicated that third baseman Evan Longoria or second baseman Joe Panik could be used there, if needed.	"Of course Pablo (Sandoval) could, too," Bochy said, referencing the two-time All-Star who has evolved into the Giants' utility player. Sandoval started at third in place of Longoria.	DONE DEAL	The Braves added veteran help for their patchwork bullpen by acquiring right-hander Anthony Swarzak from Seattle for left-hander Jesse Biddle and right-hander Arodys Vizcaino. As part of Monday's trade, Seattle is sending Atlanta $1.78 million to cover about one-third of the $5.67 million remaining in Swarzak's $8 million salary this year.	The 33-year-old Swarzak has a 5.27 ERA and three saves in six chances this season for the Mariners. He had an 8.64 ERA in his last nine appearances.	DONE DEAL 2.0	San Francisco acquired minor league pitcher Matt Seelinger from Tampa Bay as the player to be named later in the deal that sent catcher Erik Kratz to the Rays last week. Seelinger will report to Class-A Augusta.	TRAINERS ROOM	Giants: Longoria was held out of the starting lineup. He flew out as a pinch-hitter in the ninth.	UP NEXT	Atlanta RHP Julio Teheran (3-4, 3.88 ERA) pitches Tuesday in his first start against San Francisco since 2013. Teheran is going for back-to-back wins after ending a three-game losing streak with five scoreless innings against St. Louis on May 16. Right-hander Shaun Anderson (0-0, 3.60) makes his second career start for the Giants. Anderson allowed three runs (two earned) in five innings in his major league debut against Toronto on May 15.	--	More AP MLB:https://apnews.com/tag/MLB andhttps://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Minnesota Twins third baseman Miguel Sano is quickly getting back into the swing of things.	Sano, who missed the first 41 games due to a right heel laceration, hit a two-run homer in the eighth inning to lift the Twins to a 3-1 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Monday night.	Sano has homered twice in the past three games. All four of his hits since his return last Thursday have been for extra bases.	"For me and the team it was pretty good to do that in a tight game," Sano said. "I'm not completely settled in but I have worked hard to get back."	Eddie Rosario singled with one out in the eighth before Sano hit Ty Buttrey's fastball over the wall in right-center. Sano's go-ahead shot came after the Angels tied it in the seventh on Tommy La Stella's two-out single to score Brian Goodwin.	"It was just a good swing. He stayed through the ball well," Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. "He has that kind of power and strength that regardless of where you play him he drives it."	It is the first home run Buttrey (2-2) has allowed in 40 relief innings over two seasons. The 37 consecutive games that Buttrey had not allowed a home run is the longest stretch to start a major league career in Angels history.	"Even good pitchers give up runs once in a while," Angels manager Brad Ausmus said. "He has been a horse out of the pen and he gave up a home run to a guy who hits home runs. Unfortunately it happened in a tie game."	Taylor Rogers (1-0) allowed one hit in 1 2/3 innings and Blake Parker got his eighth save.	Minnesota starter Jake Odorizzi allowed three hits and struck out six in six innings. He was trying to become the first Twins pitcher to win seven consecutive starts since Kyle Gibson won his last six in 2017 and first in 2018.	La Stella had three hits for the Angels, who have dropped three of four to the Twins this season.	Luis Arraez had three hits for Minnesota and scored the game's first run in the second when he came home on Ehire Adrianza's fielder choice.	TOUGH INNING	The Angels suffered what could be two significant injuries in the eighth inning. Shohei Ohtani took a ball off his right ring finger while swinging at a third strike. Andrelton Simmons then got tripped up at the bag at first while trying to beat out an infield hit and sprained his left ankle.	Ausmus said both players had X-rays and they were negative. Ohtani will be seen by the trainers before Tuesday's game.	Simmons' injury could keep him out for an extended period. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to assess the extent of the sprain.	"It seems like the injury to Simmons might be more dire," Ausmus said. "There's no fracture, which is good but we'll still wait and see."	EFFECTIVE FROM THE PEN	This was the fifth straight game the Angels have used an opener in front of Felix Pena. The right-hander has a 2.73 ERA when coming out of the bullpen with 26 strikeouts and two walks. He has gone at least five innings in all but one of those games. Pena had a 4.15 ERA in the four games he started.	"He seems to have taken to this and likes it. I don't know if there is need to change it right this second," Ausmus said about Pena's role.	Taylor Cole made his first start of the season and third of career. He allowed hits to two of Minnesota's first three batters but got out of the first inning when Rosario grounded into a double play.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: LHP Andrew Heaney (elbow) threw 4 1/3 shutout innings in his first rehab start with Triple-A Salt Lake on Monday night. Heaney struck out 10 and allowed only two hits in a 9-6 victory over Las Vegas.	UP NEXT	Twins: RHP Michael Pineda (3-3, 5.55 ERA) snapped a five-start winless streak last Thursday at Seattle, allowing three runs over seven innings in an 11-6 victory.	Angels: RHP Trevor Cahill (2-4, 6.95 ERA) has allowed 14 home runs in nine starts, which is tied for most in the majors. He surrendered six runs in 4 1/3 innings in last Wednesday's 8-7 loss at Minnesota.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

SAN DIEGO --  It's hard to beat the San Diego Padres' combination of slugger Franmil Reyes and rookie right-hander Chris Paddack.	Reyes hit a two-run home run in the sixth inning to lift Paddack and the Padres to a 2-1 victory against the Arizona Diamondbacks on Monday night.	Luke Weaver (3-3) had outdueled Paddack (4-2) and got the first two outs in the sixth before allowing Greg Garcia's two-out single to right and Reyes' homer to center, his 15th.	"It feels great," said the 23-year-old Reyes, who's in his second big league season. "I didn't feel my hands at all. Hit it right on the barrel."	When he returned to the dugout, he kissed the bat. He said he received a shipment of new Victus bats earlier in the day, the same model as used by teammate Fernando Tatis Jr., who's currently on the injured list.	"As soon as they arrive, I put two in my locker and say those are the two I'm going to use in the game today. That one that I kiss, I took to the cage to do my thing every time I face the pitcher," he said.	"I'm feeling great. Any pitch that they throw close is going to get damaged. I'm seeing the ball pretty good right now."	The Padres snapped a three-game losing streak that had dropped them one game below .500 for the first time this season.	Reyes' homer got Paddack off the hook for a loss and made him the winner.	"I was fired up, man. I knew due to the pitch count and the situation of the game, me being on deck in a close game, that was it for me. When you've got a guy on with two outs and Franmil's up to the plate, man, everyone's off the seats and right there on the rails. He crushed that one."	Likewise, Paddack's teammates love seeing him work.	"It's great, man," Reyes said. "It's really fun to see from the outfield how he attacks the hitters and how he gets fired up and every time he strikes out somebody it's great. Fires up all the team and makes the defense behind him proud."	Paddack allowed one run and five hits in six innings, struck out seven and walked one. Weaver allowed two runs and four hits in six innings and also had seven strikeouts and no walks.	"That one just hurts," Weaver said of Reyes' home run. "You work your butt off to get to that spot in the game. Knowing how it felt early, stuff was running kind of armside. I just felt like in that pitch it just wasn't the right call and I kind of felt it before I threw it. It's a mental error in my mind where I should just step off and kind of gather and either think about it or throw something else. I think I just tried to do too much with it knowing that balls were running and it just spun out of my hand, and a good hitter, power hitter, put a swing on it."	Said manager Torey Lovullo: "You can't make mistakes to him. We're still trying to identify some soft landing spots where we can live with the damage. He's a good player. He's a good hitter, and when you make a mistake that can happen."	Lovullo added that Weaver, "was unbelievable. He really just made one mistake at the wrong time to the wrong guy. He did everything he could to keep us in this game. Unfortunately we just built a couple of innings and a couple of situations and only scored one run, and that's really the name of the game."	Arizona used small ball to take a 1-0 lead in the third, with Nick Ahmed hitting a leadoff single and eventually scoring on Jarrod Dyson's grounder.	San Diego got into a jam in the seventh when relievers Trey Wingenter and Adam Warren combined to issue three straight walks on 12 straight pitches with one out. Allen then struck out Dyson and got Ketel Marte to ground out to first.	Kirby Yates pitched the ninth for his 18th save.	BULLPEN	Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said Zack Godley (1-4, 7.90) is being moved to the bullpen.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: RHP Zack Greinke (6-1, 2.78) needs three strikeouts for 2,500 in his career. When he started at San Diego on April 2, he struck out 10 and hit two home runs in an 8-5 win. He's 13-2 with a 2.30 ERA and 156 strikeouts against 31 walks in 24 career starts against the Padres.	Padres: LHP Matt Strahm (1-3, 3.07) is scheduled to make his ninth start.	--	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

CLEVELAND --  Khris Davis' injury isn't getting better. The Athletics won't let it get any worse.	Oakland's slugger was placed on the injured list after the A's extended their winning streak to five games with a 5-3 win over the Cleveland Indians on Tuesday night. Pinch-hitter Mark Canha replaced Davis in the third inning and connected on a two-run homer off struggling Cleveland starter Trevor Bauer (4-3), who hung around for six innings despite early wildness.	Davis, who led the majors with 48 homers last season, has been slowed by a bruised left hip sustained on May 5 in Pittsburgh. Manager Bob Melvin has rested him whenever possible, but Davis said the injury isn't improving and it's time to shut down completely.	"It hasn't gotten worse, but it definitely hasn't gotten better, so it's the right move to hit the IL," Davis said. "It's basically pretty much the same since it happened. Every swing, I feel it. I think it's more of an oblique, but we'll see."	Davis was asked about his level of frustration.	"A 10," he said.	Davis, who grounded out in his one at-bat, will undergo an MRI in Cleveland on Wednesday. Until they know more, the A's will have to survive without the biggest threat in their lineup.	"It hurts," said Canha, who has just five hits since coming off the injured list -- four homers and a single. "Khris is beloved on this team and is a big presence for us, and obviously we need him back as soon as possible. Hopefully, it will be a short break and he'll be better because we need him."	Melvin expressed frustration at how long it's taken Davis to heal.	"Today, it got to the point where he realizes he needs to take the full 10 days off," Melvin said. "He's a power hitter, so he creates a lot of torque and that's where his power comes from. He needs his lower half. Even his BP swings haven't been great, but he was getting hits. Once he got into the game today, it got no better, so we agreed it was time to do something."	Meanwhile, the Indians have their own issues with Bauer, who hasn't stepped up the way the team needed him to while waiting for injured starters Corey Kluber and Mike Clevinger to return.	Bauer walked four, struck out five and hit three while throwing a season-high 123 pitches. The right-hander is at a loss to explain why he's not getting results.	"Overall, I thought my stuff was really good tonight," he said. "Gave up four hits. Curveball on the black goes for a bloop hit and then five pitches later a fastball at the letters goes for a homer. I think that's just the kind of the way things are going for me right now."	Oakland reliever Liam Hendricks (2-0) pitched two scoreless innings and Blake Treinen, the A's fourth reliever, worked the ninth for his ninth save in 11 tries.	Jurickson Profar homered in the eighth as Oakland improved to 7-1 against AL Central teams this season. The A's are 59-20 vs. Cleveland, Chicago, Minnesota, Detroit and Kansas City dating to Aug. 23, 2016.	Francisco Lindor and Carlos Santana hit solo homers for Cleveland.	With Bauer struggling to find his rhythm, Canha hit his third career pinch-homer to give the A's a 3-1 lead in the third. Canha fell behind 1-2 before reaching out of the strike zone to push a four-seam fastball over the wall in right.	"When you get thrown into a situation like that, you've just got to simplify," he said.	PEREZ INJURED	Indians catcher Roberto Perez was diagnosed with a concussion after he was struck in the mask by a foul ball in the third inning. Manager Terry Francona said the team will wait until he reports Wednesday before deciding whether to put him on the concussion. The Indians will bring catcher Eric Haase from Columbus as a precaution.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: LHP Brett Anderson (neck strain) appears on track to make his next start after he ducked to avoid Roberto Perez's broken bat in the fifth inning Monday night. Anderson came out an inning later. "I hope it doesn't affect his bullpen session, let alone his next outing," Melvin said.	Indians: Clevinger threw an extended bullpen, using all his pitches in the latest stage of his rapid recovery from an upper back strain. Francona said Clevinger could throw another bullpen session or possibly face live batters in his next workout.	UP NEXT	Athletics: RHP Frankie Montas (5-2, 2.67 ERA) starts the series finale. He struck out 10 and did not allow a walk last week in a win over Detroit.	Indians: RHP Jefry Rodriguez (1-3, 3.45 ERA) tries to bounce back after being tagged for a season-high four runs and seven hits last week against Baltimore. He beat Oakland on May 11 for his first win with Cleveland.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

CHICAGO --  The heart of the Chicago Cubs' lineup, including a taped-up Javier Baez, proved to be too much for the Philadelphia Phillies and their tired bullpen.	Baez's pinch-hit single capped a two-run, ninth-inning rally and lifted the Cubs over Philadelphia 3-2 on Tuesday night to stop the Phillies' four-game winning streak.	Baez didn't start for a second straight game because of a jammed right heel, but the 2018 NL MVP runner-up came through immediately off the bench with the game on the line.	"I'm impressed, but not surprised," said Kris Bryant, who had three hits and used his speed to slide home with two runs. "He's been doing stuff like that the last couple of years. Thankfully, he was up there in that situation to win the game like that."	Chicago trailed 2-1 starting the ninth, but Juan Nicasio (0-2) walked Bryant leading off, Anthony Rizzo doubled and, after Willson Contreras hit a shallow flyout, Jason Heyward was intentionally walked.	Bryant scored when Albert Almora Jr. hit a chopper toward first, and Nicasio's underhand toss to catcher J.T. Realmuto was late, a call upheld by a video review. Baez, lined Nicasio's first pitch to right over a drawn-in infield.	Manager Joe Maddon said he was saving Baez for the moment, even if the injured star might not be able to play in the field after batting for second baseman Daniel Descalso.  Cubs head athletic trainer had told Maddon at the start of the inning that Baez was getting taped up and would be available to bat.	"If you don't do it, how do you play defense after that? But a lot of time I don't worry about that stuff," Maddon said.	Kyle Ryan (1-1) got two outs for the win.	Nicasio earned his first save by getting the final two outs in the Phillies' 5-4 win in 10 innings on Monday night.  Manager Gabe Kapler was forced to go with Nicasio again after Hector Neris tossed an inning on Monday and Seranthony Dominguez pitched two.	"The way he's been throwing the ball, we felt confident he could get the job done," Phillies manager Gabe Kapler said.	Phillies slugger Bryce Harper went 0 for 4, dropping his average to .224, and failed to reach base at Wrigley Field for the first time in 19 games at the iconic ballpark. Jean Segura doubled in the first to extend his hitting streak to 12 games.	Running on the pitch from second base, Bryant raced home to score in the first inning when Contreras grounded to shortstop. Bryant slid home ahead of first baseman Rhys Hoskins' throw.	Andrew McCutchen hit a two-run single in the seventh off Brandon Kintzler to put the Phillies ahead.	Cubs starter Jose Quintana allowed two hits in six shutout innings, leaving after 100 pitches. Philadelphia's Zach Eflin settled down after a 32-pitch first inning that included three walks and allowed one run and six hits in six innings.	CUBS CLOSER CONCERNS	Maddon said he's prepared to finish the season without a designated closer, as long as RHP Pedro Strop returns effectively from a strained left hamstring and RHP Carl Edwards Jr. rounds back into his 2018 form. Edwards was charged with Philadelphia's two runs. RHP Brandon Morrow, who had 22 saves last year before getting hurt in July, has started to throw of flat ground.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: Kapler said RHP Vince Velasquez (right forearm strain) threw an effective side session on Monday and is on track of a bullpen session on Wednesday.	Cubs: Baez (jammed right heel) didn't start for the second game after starting the first 44. Before the game Maddon said Baez's heel was still sore and he will be checked to make sure the injury isn't more significant. Baez was hurt fielding a grounder in the third inning on Sunday and exited in the sixth.	UP NEXT	Cubs LHP Cole Hamels (4-0, 3.13) makes his first start against the Philadelphia on Wednesday. The Phillies drafted Hamels and he won 114 games for the Phillies before he was traded to Texas in July 2015. Phillies rookie LHP Cole Irvin (2-0, 2.77) won his first two starts after his recall from Triple-A.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

PITTSBURGH --  German Marquez could sense his delivery speeding up. So the Colorado Rockies pitcher made a concerted effort to slow things down, putting a halt to his team's four-game losing streak in the process.	The 24-year-old struck out seven over eight dominant innings in a 5-0 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Tuesday night, never allowing a runner to third base while giving up three hits and just one walk.	"The first couple innings I was a little quick with my mechanics," Marquez said. "I made that adjustment after that, and all my pitches seemed to be there after that."	Certainly looked that way.	Aside from a sinking line drive by Pittsburgh's Bryan Reynolds in the first that scooted under the glove of leftfielder David Dahl and turned into a double, Marquez (5-2) overwhelmed the Pirates. He retired 10 straight at one point and sent down nine of the final 10 batters he faced after getting out of a two-on, two-out jam in the fifth.	"He was sharp," Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said. "He was really tough on the right-handed hitters. We weren't able to string anything together against him."	Trevor Story hit his 11th homer of the season for the Rockies. Charlie Blackmon went 3 for 5 for Colorado, including a two-run triple to left off Chris Archer (1-4) in the fourth. Story homered for the second straight game when his shot to deep left field in the third inning glanced off the glove of Pittsburgh leftfielder Bryan Reynolds and into the seats.	That was more than enough offense for Marquez, who gave the Rockies just their second win during their current eight-game road swing by shutting down the surging Pirates. Marquez improved to 4-1 in his career against the Pirates and lowered his road ERA this season to 2.08.	Pittsburgh came in off a 7-4 road trip through St. Louis, Arizona and San Diego but never found its footing against Marquez. First baseman Josh Bell -- who entered the game with a major-league leading 44 RBI, the third-most by a Pirates player through 44 games since it became an official statistic in 1920 -- went 0 for 4. Bell's teammates didn't fare much better. Pittsburgh mustered only Reynolds' double and a pair of singles in the fifth by Melky Cabrera and Francisco Cervelli.	AVERAGE ARCHER	The Pirates have been able to keep pace in the crowded NL Central despite a patched together starting rotation. Archer -- who missed three weeks with inflammation in his right thumb before returning last week -- was hoping to go deep to give Hurdle more options for Wednesday, when reliever Montana DuRapau will work as an "opener."	Instead, Archer needed 23 pitches to get through a scoreless first inning and 92 in all while allowing four runs, three earned, in five innings.	"If I could have made a couple of pitches, some key pitches, the outcome of the game might have been a little different," Archer said. "Looking at the bright side, it's a step in the right direction. I felt like I had more left in me."	Archer could have used a break or two, too, in an effort to get his first win since April 7. It didn't happen. Daniel Murphy led off with a double and moved to third on a grounder by Ian Desmond. The Pirates appeared to have Murphy caught in a run down between third and home after a grounder by Tony Wolters, but Cervelli's flip to third baseman Colin Moran deflected off Murphy's helmet and rolled away from Moran, allowing Murphy to score. Story's shot to left in the third pushed him into a tie with Nolan Arenado for the team lead in home runs.	"With the ball that went off Bryan's glove, the dude hit it a long ways," Archer said. "Good pitchers get out of those situations, they minimize the damage. I was really close but came up a little bit short."	HE'S OUTTA HERE	Hurdle was ejected in the eighth after pinch-hitter Jake Elmore was called out on an odd play at first. Elmore hit a grounder to Marquez and Marquez made a sweeping tag attempt as Elmore ran to first. Elmore was called out on the field and the call was upheld on video review, even though replays clearly showed Marquez failed to tag Elmore.	"There comes a point in time where as a manager, just want to take a stand for a player," Hurdle said. "I had a couple of looks. Obviously, they had more looks. I disagreed."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: RF Gregory Polanco was a late scratch due to finger discomfort in his left hand. ... Cervelli left in the sixth inning with an upper chest contusion after a foul ball appeared to hit his throat. ... LF Corey Dickerson (right shoulder sprain) threw to bases and participated in batting practice.	UP NEXT	Rockies: Jon Gray (3-4, 4.73 ERA) is 0-1 with a 9.95 ERA in three starts against the Pirates.

BALTIMORE --  The New York Yankees have climbed into first place in the AL East in spite of a myriad of injuries and partially because the front end of their schedule is loaded with games against the Baltimore Orioles.	Clint Frazier homered twice and had a career-high five RBI, Gary Sanchez contributed a three-run drive and the Yankees kept up their assault on Baltimore pitching in an 11-4 rout Tuesday night.	Nearly a fifth of New York's 47 games thus far have been against the Orioles, who are 6-17 at home and 15-33 overall, the worst record in the AL. The Yankees are 8-2 against the Orioles, have outscored them 73-40 and hit at least one home run in every game.	New York is 5-0 at Camden Yards this season and has won an unprecedented 10 straight in Baltimore, opening a two-game division lead despite 17 players going on the injured list.	"I personally like hitting in this ballpark and it's a fun atmosphere whenever we're here," Frazier said. "Our team is really good, so it's just a matter of whenever we get hot, what are we going to do?"	Against Baltimore, the answer is obvious -- even if the Yankees are without Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton, Didi Gregorius, Troy Tulowitzki and a host of others.	"This a really special team and obviously things haven't gone our way with guys on the injury list," Frazier said. "We're shocking people but we're not shocking ourselves because we know what we can do."	Five of Frazier's eight home runs this season have come against Baltimore, and Sanchez and Gleyber Torres each have homered eight times against Baltimore pitching.	New York made it easy for Domingo German (9-1) to win his sixth consecutive start and increase his major league-leading victory total. The right-hander pitched only five innings and left with a 9-3 lead.	David Hale worked  four innings to earn his first save since 2010 at Class A.	Of the major league-high 100 home runs the Orioles have allowed, 28 have been hit by the Yankees.	"We're facing good teams, but you've got to pitch here," Baltimore manager Brandon Hyde said. "You have to stay off the barrel and you've got to be able to locate. And if you don't, in a hitter's ballpark against guys that mash, you're going to give up 100 homers 40-something games into it."	Oh, these Yankees can mash.	"We have obviously capable guys and guys with a lot of power," manager Aaron Boone said. "When we have gotten mistakes, we've been able to take advantage."	Sanchez got it started, hitting his second three-run homer in as many nights before David Hess (1-6) got an out. Sanchez has hit eight of his 14 home runs versus the Orioles.	In the third, Gio Urshela doubled in a run before Frazier homered , and New York went up 9-0 in the fifth when Frazier connected following a pair of walks. Both of his multihomer games gave been against Baltimore.	Stevie Wilkerson hit a three-run homer for the Orioles, who have lost 10 and 12. Baltimore has allowed double-digits in runs in three straight games and four of six.	SIX IN FIVE CLUB	Sanchez has six HRs at Camden Yards this season -- in only five games. The only other Yankees to hit at least six HRs in their first five games at a ballpark in one season are Lou Gehrig (1930, League Park), Babe Ruth (1930, Shibe Park) and Tony Lazzeri (1936, Shibe Park).	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: Gregorius returned from Tommy John surgery to play in an extended spring training game Monday but emerged dehydrated and was given an IV. Boone said Gregorius was held out of Tuesday's game but was fine and will resume playing Wednesday. ... Stanton (left shoulder) skipped a game in his rehab assignment with Class A Tampa after being hit near the knee with a pitch a few days earlier, but is expected to resume playing Wednesday. ... RHP Dellin Betances (right shoulder) is "bouncing back well," Boone said after the reliever threw 120 feet on flat ground Tuesday. ... LHP James Paxton (knee) will pitch a simulated game (three innings) at the team's complex in Tampa, Florida, on Friday and if everything goes well, he'll be able to rejoin the rotation. ... RHP Masahiro Tanaka, forced from Saturday's game after being hit in the leg with a comebacker, will start against the Orioles on Thursday. ... Judge (left oblique) shagged fly balls and took swings without a ball on Tuesday and is "definitely feeling better," Boone said ... RHP Danny Farquhar, who collapsed in the Chicago White Sox dugout on April 20 last year because of a ruptured aneurysm and brain hemorrhage, struck out three in 1 1/3 innings of an extended spring training game Tuesday.	Orioles: RHP Alex Cobb (back) continues to rehab at the team's facility in Sarasota and his return to the club remains "open-ended," manager Brandon Hyde said.	UP NEXT	Yankees: CC Sabathia (2-1, 2.97 ERA) starts Wednesday night, trying to break a streak of six straight winless starts in Baltimore since June 5, 2016.	Orioles: Dan Straily (1-3, 8.51) makes his second appearance of the year against New York. Pitching in relief on April 7, he gave up five runs, five hits and two HRs in 1 1/3 innings.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

TORONTO --  It turns out Rowdy Tellez can hit left-handers, too.	Tellez went deep twice and collected a career-high five RBI, leading the Toronto Blue Jays to a 10-3 victory over the Boston Red Sox.	It was the first multihomer game for the 24-year-old rookie, who bats from the left side. Three of his eight homers this season have come against lefty pitching, including his two against Eduardo Rodriguez (3-4) on Tuesday night. He is batting .314 with 12 RBI against lefties.	"I'm just glad (manager) Charlie (Montoyo) gives me every opportunity to face (left-handers)," Tellez said. "I'm just trying to take advantage of it. It just does a lot for my confidence when he throws me in the lineup and lets me face them."	Tellez put Toronto ahead to stay in the fourth inning, belting a two-run shot off the third-deck facade above right field. Randal Grichuk followed with a drive to left for his eighth homer.	Tellez then made it 6-0 with a three-run shot to right-center in the fifth.	"For us as an offense, it's good to go out there and play well behind a good start from one of our top pitchers," Tellez said.	Blue Jays right-hander Marcus Stroman (2-6) issued a season-high six walks in six innings, but limited the Red Sox to one run and five hits.	Stroman has been hurt by poor run support this year, but he said he was never concerned.	"I knew guys would break out at some point," he said. "I'm not really worried about the run support. It's a really long year. I have a lot of faith in my guys each and every time out."	Mitch Moreland, Rafael Devers and Jackie Bradley Jr. connected for Boston, but the defending World Series champions were largely held in check after winning 12-2 in the series opener Monday.	Boston had won Rodriguez's last seven starts. He was charged with six runs and six hits in five innings.	He had gone five straight games without allowing a homer.	"Just missing location and throwing the wrong pitch at the wrong time, that's what I think," Rodriguez said.	Manager Alex Cora said he was surprised to see Rodriguez struggle so much against lefties such. Before Tuesday's game he was giving up a .351 average to lefties in 2019, well above his career rate of .273.	"He was very dominant last year I think against lefties," Cora said. "We even used him like that in the playoffs to get lefties out. It hasn't happened this year so we'll take a look."	ON SECOND THOUGHT	Amid much controversy, the Blue Jays picked Monday's Victoria Day national holiday to give top prospect Vladimir Guerrero Jr. a scheduled rest day. It did not play out well, with rookie's absence taking on a life of its own in the Toronto media.	Blue Jays general manager Ross Atkins said Tuesday the team should have handled the situation better.	"The one thing that I regret in all of the things that we have talked about with Charlie, I had not talked to him about the importance of Victoria Day," he said. "There are a lot of things in Canadian culture and about this great country that I have talked to him about, but I did not share with him the importance of Victoria Day."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: 2B Dustin Pedroia (left knee) and INF Brock Holt (right knee) both played seven innings for Triple-A Pawtucket. ... LHP Brian Johnson made the second start of his rehab assignment for Double-A Portland, giving up three runs in 1 1/3 innings. ... OF J.D. Martinez was sidelined by an illness. Cora said he was available to pinch-hit if necessary, but he likely would return to the lineup Wednesday. ... RHP Nathan Eovaldi (right elbow) successfully came through a 35-pitch bullpen session.	Blue Jays: RHP Ryan Tepera (right elbow) was placed on the 10-day injured list and will be meeting with a specialist. RHP Jimmy Cordero was recalled from Triple-A Buffalo to take his roster spot.	UP NEXT	Right-hander Rick Porcello (3-4, 4.80 ERA), who takes the mound Wednesday for the Red Sox, has struggled in his starts at Rogers Centre, with a 4-7 record and a 5.47 ERA. Toronto right-hander Aaron Sanchez (3-4, 3.88 ERA) is 4-4 with a 3.91 ERA in 20 appearances against Boston.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  The Los Angeles Dodgers just keep winning when Clayton Kershaw is on the mound.	Kershaw took a shutout into the seventh inning in his first start at Tropicana Field and the Los Dodgers beat the Tampa Bay Rays 7-3 on Tuesday night. The three-time NL Cy Young Award winner (4-0) wound up allowing two runs, six hits, one walk and had eight strikeouts in 6 1/3 innings.	"I thought all night long, just mixing his pitches, changing locations, sequencing, everything was great," Los Angeles manager Dave Roberts said.	Los Angeles has won 15 consecutive regular season games starter by Kershaw. The left-hander is the only pitcher to have three separate streaks of 13 or more games (13 in 2014 and 16 in 2017) since 1920.	The Dodgers, with the National League's best record at 32-17, have won six of seven. Tampa Bay dropped two games behind the AL East-leading New York Yankees and are 13-13 since April 19th when it lead the division by 5 1/2 games.	The Rays were coming off a 13-5 loss Sunday to the Yankees.	"We did so many things really well early on in the year," Rays manager Kevin Cash said. "Unfortunately the last two days, just ugly losses."	Kershaw had scattered four hits through six but was replaced by Pedro Baez with two on and one out in the seventh and Los Angeles up 6-0.	"Until that last inning everything went pretty well, not a whole lot of hard contact," Kershaw said.	Baez departed after facing one batter when Willy Adames had an RBI infield single that bruised the reliever's right knee. Baez needed assistance as he gingerly walked off the field.	X-rays were negative but manager Dave Roberts said Baez won't be available Wednesday.	"It was loud hitting the knee cap," Roberts said. "Since there's no fracture, we'll see how it responds tomorrow in treatment. We've got a couple days to assess where (he's) is at."	The Rays then got within 6-3 on a run-scoring single by Austin Meadows and Tommy Pham's RBI double off Scott Alexander.	"I don't know of any part of our game that we performed well," Cash said. "I know we got going there late, but it was late."	The Dodgers took a 1-0 lead in the first when Max Muncy had a bunt single and scored from first when right fielder Avisail Garcia misplayed Justin Turner's single.	Roberts had David Freese pinch-hit when left-hander Jalen Beeks replaced opener Hunter Wood (1-1) to begin the third.	Freese doubled, went to third on Muncy's grounder and scored as the Dodgers took a 2-0 lead on Turner's sacrifice fly.	"They basically took what we gave them," Pham said. "That's what good players and good teams do."	Austin Barnes put the Dodgers ahead 3-0 on a fourth-inning RBI single.	Run-scoring singles by Kike Hernandez, Corey Seager and pinch-hitter Joc Pederson off Beeks made it 6-0 in the seventh.	Pederson added an RBI double during the ninth,	Tampa Bay pinch-hitter Kevin Kiermaier was thrown out trying to stretch a double into a triple leading off the eighth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: RHP Tyler Glasnow (right forearm strain) could resume playing catch next week. ... INF Yandy Diaz (bruised left hand) didn't play. ... 3B Matt Duffy (strained left hamstring), who is also playing shortstop and outfield during his rehab assignment, joined Triple-A Durham, ... C's Mike Zunino (left quadriceps strain) and Michael Perez (right oblique strain) may start rehab assignments next week.	URIAS UPDATE	Dodgers LHP Julio Urias was reinstated Tuesday from administrative leave by Major League Baseball. He was placed on leave while MLB officials looked into his May 13 arrest for investigation of misdemeanor domestic battery.	BELLINGER BATTING	Los Angeles RF Cody Bellinger went 1 for 3 with two walks and had his average drop from .405 to .404.	PERFECT AGAINST THE ACE	Garcia went 2 for 2 with a walk against Kershaw, giving him four hits in four at-bats and two walks overall.	UP NEXT	Dodgers LHP Rich Hill (1-1) will face an unannounced Rays reliever in Wednesday night's finale of a two-game series.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

DETROIT --  A few innings after his first major league home run, Harold Ramirez nearly made a big mistake in the field.	A replay review offered the Miami outfielder a reprieve.	"I just say to (teammate Rosell) Herrera: `I know I got it, so I know they're going to call out," Ramirez said.	Ramirez initially appeared to drop a fly ball in the bottom of the ninth, but the call was overturned after a review, and although Detroit tied the game that inning, the Marlins went on to beat the Tigers 5-4 in 11 innings. Chad Wallach hit a tiebreaking double in the 11th, lifting Miami to its fourth straight victory.	Detroit forced extra innings by scoring two unearned runs off Miami closer Sergio Romo. The bottom of the ninth included an error, two replay reversals and the ejection of Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire.	That was the only success Detroit had against the Miami bullpen, though. Nick Anderson (1-1) struck out the side in the 10th, then closed the Tigers out in the 11th for his first career win.	Wallach put the Marlins ahead in the 11th with a two-out drive to left-center field off Joe Jimenez (2-2). The Tigers have dropped seven in a row, although their game Sunday against Oakland was suspended in the seventh inning.	Detroit was down 4-2 and hadn't managed a baserunner since the fourth inning when Niko Goodrum hit an infield single to start the bottom of the ninth. He was initially called out, but replays showed Romo may not have touched first while trying to cover the bag. Goodrum was ruled safe after a review, and when Nicholas Castellanos hit a one-out grounder to third, Goodrum was safe again when second baseman Starlin Castro dropped the throw to second for an error.	"This would have been a tough loss, because we really played well all day, and then just ... kind of shoot ourselves in the foot a little bit there in the ninth," Marlins manager Don Mattingly said.	Miguel Cabrera hit an RBI single off diving third baseman Brian Anderson and into left, leaving men on first and third. Then Ronny Rodriguez lifted a fly ball to deep left field. Ramirez appeared to drop it, and a run came home, tying the game at 4 -- but replays showed Ramirez had the ball briefly in his glove before losing control as he tried to transfer it to his throwing hand.	The call was overturned and the batter was ruled out -- although the run still counted. Gardenhire came out to argue with third base umpire Fieldin Culbreth, and although Culbreth didn't make a demonstrative ejection motion, Gardenhire disappeared from view in the dugout, and the Tigers eventually confirmed he'd been tossed.	"Obviously the umpire didn't think he had control. Then we go out and they appealed it, and New York said that somehow he did have control," Detroit bench coach Steve Liddle said. "I think that's one of those instances where slow motion can hurt you a little bit, and it looked like it came back to bite us there."	Ramirez hit his first career home run in the fourth inning, and Anderson also homered for Miami. Marlins starter Caleb Smith allowed two runs and three hits in five innings, striking out seven.	Miami shut out the New York Mets in its previous two games, and the Marlins took a quick 2-0 lead over Detroit. Anderson hit a sacrifice fly in the first inning, and Wallach added an RBI double in the second.	JaCoby Jones hit a solo homer for the Tigers in the third, but Ramirez -- playing his sixth major league game -- answered with his solo home run an inning later. His teammates followed tradition by ignoring him when he got back to the dugout, so Ramirez playfully high-fived the air.	"I really just tried to enjoy that," said Ramirez, who said he'd give the ball to his mother.	Cabrera made it 3-2 with an RBI single in the bottom of the fourth, but Anderson's solo shot in the seventh restored the two-run advantage for Miami.	BULLPEN WORK	Aside from the ninth inning, Detroit didn't have a hit against the Miami bullpen. Austin Brice, Wei-Yin Chen and Tayron Guerrero were perfect from the sixth through the eighth.	After his impressive 10th inning, Anderson allowed a walk in the 11th but held on for the win. He struck out five in two innings.	Detroit's Nick Ramirez allowed only one hit in three innings of relief, but it was the homer by Anderson.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: Before the game, Miami recalled OF Austin Dean from Triple-A New Orleans and put INF/OF Jon Bertl on the 10-day injured list, retroactive to Sunday, with a left oblique strain.	UP NEXT	Marlins: Jose Urena (1-6) takes the mound for Miami on Wednesday night in the middle game of the series. He had a 9.22 ERA in his first three starts, but has since lowered it to 4.44.	Tigers: Daniel Norris (2-2) starts for Detroit.	---	Follow Noah Trister at www.Twitter.com/noahtrister	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

NEW YORK --  With the Mets trailing by a run in the eighth inning, Pete Alonso drove a fastball from Tanner Rainey down the left-field line, well over the foul pole.	"I talked to it," Alonso said. "I was like `stay fair, please' and it listened."	Alonso set the Mets rookie record for home runs before the All-Star break with 1 1/2 months to spare, Amed Rosario had a winning infield single with two outs in the ninth and New York rallied from deficits three times to beat the Washington Nationals 6-5 Tuesday night.	Washington led 1-0 in the fifth, 3-1 in the seventh and 5-4 in the eighth, but the Mets (22-25) kept bouncing back and won their second straight game after general manager Brodie Van Wagenen said Mickey Callaway will remain the team's manager "for the foreseeable future."	Alonso's 16th homer broke the team rookie record for the first half set by Ron Swoboda in 1965. Alonso turned on a 1-2 pitch from Rainey (0-1), and the ball rose 126 feet and bounced off the Porsche Grille restaurant. The home run call on the field was upheld by a video review.	Rainey walked Adeiny Hechavarria and J.D. Davis with one out in the ninth, Kyle Barraclough relieved and Jeff McNeil grounded into a forceout that left runners at the corners. McNeil advanced on defensive indifference and, with Robinson Cano on deck, Rosario hit a two-hopper grounder to shortstop and beat Trea Turner's throw.	"He just willed himself to run faster it looked like to me," Callaway said "It was unbelievable."	Rosario made it to first in 4.03 seconds according to StatCast.	"I felt like I threw it good, but he can run," Turner said.	Rosario clapped his hands and was mobbed by teammates between second and third before getting doused by Alonso.	"The moment I hit that ball, I immediately thought I have to get there," Rosario said through a translator.	Edwin Diaz (1-2) worked around a ninth-inning single for his first win with the Mets. Washington (19-29) lost its third straight and dropped a season-high 10 games under .500	Mets starter Zack Wheeler gave up three runs and four hits in seven innings, while Washington's Erick Fedde allowed one run and four hits in five innings.	Juan Soto homered in the second, but McNeil tied the score with a fifth-inning single. Brian Dozier put the Nationals back ahead with a two-run homer in the seventh, but Davis's three-run pinch homer off Wander Suero gave the Mets a 4-3 lead in the bottom half.	Turner hit a tying double in the eighth off Jeurys Familia and scored on Soto's double against Daniel Zamora.	"We're right there, but we've got to win," Washington manager Dave Martinez said. "The bottom line is we have to start winning."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: RHP Jeremy Hellickson (strained right shoulder) was placed on the 10-day IL. Washington manager Dave Martinez does not think it will be a long stint. Hellickson saw a doctor Monday and was cleared to keep throwing. ... RHP Anibal Sanchez (strained left hamstring) had a bullpen session Tuesday and could throw a simulated game Friday.	Mets: OF Michael Conforto (concussion) rode a bike on Monday, his first physical activity since being placed on the 7-day concussion IL. Callaway said he did not know whether Conforto would be activated when first eligible on Friday. ... CF Brandon Nimmo (sore neck) was a late scratch from the starting lineup. ... LHP Jason Vargas (left hamstring tightness) will throw a bullpen session Wednesday and could pitch this weekend against Detroit.	UP NEXT	RHP Max Scherzer (2-5, 3.72 ERA), the 2016 and 2017 NL Cy Young Award winner starts for Washington and RHP Jacob deGrom (3-5, 3.98), the 2018 NL Cy Young winner starts for New York in a rematch of opening-day starters. The Mets won the opener 2-0 as deGrom struck out 10 and allowed six hits in six innings. Scherzer gave up two runs and two hits in 7 2/3 innings, striking out 12.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

MILWAUKEE --  With Christian Yelich on the bench, Milwaukee couldn't even get a runner past second base.	Sonny Gray and three Cincinnati relievers held down the Brewers, who were missing Yelich because of back spasms, in the Reds' 3-0 victory Tuesday night.	It was the major league-leading seventh shutout for the Reds as the Brewers were blanked for the first time this season.	Yelich was a late scratch from the starting lineup because of the back issue. Manager Craig Counsell said Yelich's status would be reviewed Wednesday.	Gray (1-4) earned his first win of the season with six shutout innings in his first appearance ever at Miller Park. He tied his season-high with nine strikeouts. Raisel Iglesias earned his 10th save.	"I've had a plan, I just stayed with it and trusted that," Gray said. "I just trusted it making big pitches with runners on."	The Brewers showed a lack of punch without Yelich, the 2018 National League MVP, striking out 14 times. Yelich is batting .325 and had a major league-leading 19 home runs coming into Tuesday night.	Nick Senzel led off the first inning with a triple off Brewers starter Gio Gonzalez (2-1) and scored when Gonzalez threw a wild pitch to Phillip Ervin. Ervin then doubled, scoring Eugenio Suarez, who had walked. And Ervin scored when Kyle Farmer hit into a fielder's choice.	"They caught me on my heels that first inning," Gonzalez said. "They were real aggressive right away."	After cruising through the first three innings giving up only one hit, Gray walked Ryan Braun and Yasmani Grandal to start the fourth inning. But Braun was thrown out trying to steal third, Eric Thames grounded out and Keston Hiura struck out. The Brewers also put two runners on base in the fifth and sixth innings, but couldn't score.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: Yelich previously missed parts of seven games in late April and early May because of back problems, but did not go on the injured list...3B Travis Shaw (right wrist strain) is expected to begin a rehab assignment with Triple-A San Antonio on Wednesday after being placed on the 10-day injured list Tuesday.	Reds: OF Yasiel Puig, who suffered a sprained right shoulder after making a catch in right field and crashing into the padded wall in Cincinnati on Sunday, didn't play but won't be going on the injured list, manager David Bell said. ... LHP Zach Duke (right calf strain) was placed on the 10-day injured list retroactive to Monday and IF Josh VanMeter was recalled from Triple-A Louisville.	BASE-RUNNING BASICS	When Braun was caught stealing, he didn't start running until Reds catcher Curt Casali had already caught a wide-and-outside pitch from Gray. The Reds' Nick Senzel was called out in the fifth inning for running out of the baseline. He was an easy out after he started to try to steal second base before Gonzalez threw a pitch.	PITCH-HITTING	Brewers LHP Brandon Woodruff lifted his season batting average to .333 (8-for-24) with a pinch-hit single. As a pinch-hitter, he's 2-for-3.	OUT BY STRIKEOUT	Reds LHP Amir Garrett has recorded his last nine outs by strikeout. On Tuesday, he pitched the eighth inning and struck out all three Brewers batters he faced.	A HOME WELCOME	Hiura, a first-round draft pick of Milwaukee in 2017, made his first appearance at Miller Park. His major-league debut was on May 14. The second baseman went 2-for-4 with two singles and two strikeouts.	UP NEXT	Reds: RHP Luis Castillo (5-1, 1.90 ERA) has won his previous two starts, at home against the Chicago Cubs and in San Francisco against the Giants.	Brewers: RHP Zach Davies (5-0, 1.54 ERA) has given up only one earned run in each of his previous two starts, against the Phillies and the Cubs, both on the road.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Gutty pitching performances came in different sizes for the Texas Rangers in their 5-3 win over the Seattle Mariners on Tuesday night.	Lance Lynn allowed two runs over seven innings and Shawn Kelley earned the save hours after learning that two lumps removed from his throat last week were benign.	Lynn (6-3) gave up five singles and one walk and had a season-high 11 strikeouts in his 200th career start. Kelley, who was activated from the 10-day injured list on Tuesday, allowed a two-out ninth-inning homer to Omar Narvaez, who had three hits, in earning his third save of the season.	The loss continued a tailspin for Seattle, which is 10-26 since a 13-2 start.	Nomar Mazara had three hits, an RBI and scored one of his two runs on a sacrifice fly after initially being ruled out at the plate before a successful Texas challenge. Joey Gallo hit a two-run home run, his 15th of the season, in the eighth inning.	Lynn had a shutout going into the seventh until an RBI single by Narvaez that nearly cleared the right-field fence. With the tying run at second base and one out, Lynn struck out Tim Beckham and J.P. Crawford to hold the lead and finish with 120 pitches, his highest total since May 2017.	"That was my inning to finish," Lynn said. "I wanted to clean up my mess."	Rangers manager Chris Woodward said he gave Lynn such leeway with an extra day's rest coming up.	Kelley was told he would pitch either the eighth or ninth inning. Woodward gave the eighth and a one-run lead to Jose Leclerc, who retired the side in order and has set down 16 straight batters over his last four games.	"I'd be lying to you if I didn't say there weren't thoughts over the last few weeks of, `Will I play again?" said Kelley, 35. "It was really fun to be out there and just be in a situation to help the guys."	"It was awesome to have Kelley back out there," Woodward said.	The Rangers have won six of their last seven games to reach .500 at 23-23. Last season, they were at .500 once en route to finishing last in the American League West at 67-95.	Left-hander Tommy Milone (0-1) survived a 31-pitch first inning and allowed two runs on three hits in five innings in his first major league start of the season. Milone's contract was selected from Triple-A Tacoma earlier in the day.	Milone, 32, said his pre-game nerves were "more excited than anything."	"It was just a lot of fun to get back out there and be up here," he said.	LIL' HELP, PLEASE	The Mariners played without second baseman Dee Gordon and third baseman Ryon Healy, each placed on the 10-day injured list before the game. Gordon has a right wrist contusion, and Healy has lower back inflammation.	Rookie Shed Long, recalled from Tacoma, replaced Gordon and singled in the sixth inning for his first major league hit in his 11th big league at-bat.	"Been joking with him a little bit," Mariners manager Scott Servais said. "I said, `You'll eventually get a hit."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: LF Willie Calhoun left the game after six innings with tightness in his left quad. ... SS Elvis Andrus (right hamstring strain) began a rehab assignment Tuesday with Double-A Frisco, going 0 for 3 with one strikeout as the designated hitter.	UP NEXT	Mariners: In the series finale on Wednesday afternoon, LHP Marco Gonzales (5-3, 3.65 ERA) will seek to end a three-game losing streak during which he has a 5.93 ERA after compiling a 2.80 ERA in his first seven starts.	Rangers: RHP Adrian Sampson (1-3, 4.79 ERA) will make his second straight appearance when following an opener, this time Jesse Chavez. Sampson earned his first major league win last Friday, limiting the St. Louis Cardinals to one earned run in 5 1/3 innings.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

HOUSTON --  As Houston's Justin Verlander flirted with a no-hitter against the Chicago White Sox, he took a moment to scan the seats behind home plate to see whether childhood idol Nolan Ryan, who threw a record seven no-hitters, was watching from his usual seat behind the plate.	After throwing two no-hitters in his career, Verlander thought to himself that it would be "pretty cool" if Ryan was there to see it if he joined him in the exclusive group of players who have tossed at least three.	Ryan was at the game, but it wasn't to be.	"I screwed it up," Verlander said with a laugh.	Verlander took a no-hitter into the seventh inning and struck out a season-high 12 to lead the Astros to a 5-1 win over the White Sox.	Verlander (8-1), who said his slider was his best pitch Tuesday night, was in control from the first pitch, allowing one hit and walking one in eight innings for his fourth straight win and the seventh in eight starts. The only hit off him came when Jose Abreu sent the first pitch of his at-bat just over the wall and out of reach of a leaping Jake Marisnick in straightaway center field with one out in the seventh to cut the lead to 5-1.	"My thought was if Jake catches this, it's over. I'm going to get it," Verlander said. "Sure enough it went over. He had a great effort at it (but) I was pretty confident that that ball was going to be a home run unless a miracle happened."	It was Abreu's sixth career off of Verlander.	"We all know the kind of pitcher that he is," Abreu said in Spanish through a translator. "He has all of my respect. He's one of the best. In that at-bat I just went in there trying to make hard contact if possible. I am happy that I was able to do it."	Yuli Gurriel hit a solo homer off Dylan Covey (0-3) in the fourth inning to give the Astros home runs in 18 straight games, tying the second-longest streak in franchise history.	Verlander, who threw no-hitters in 2007 and 2011, retired his first five batters with three strikeouts before walking Yonder Alonso with two outs in the second. But he got right back on track, sitting down Tim Anderson to end the inning.	He needed just 11 pitches to strike out the side in the third inning and fanned two in the fourth. He struck out one in the fifth and one more in the sixth after a long layoff after the Astros sent eight hitters to the plate in the bottom of their four-run fifth.	Yoan Moncada struck out to start the seventh before Abreu's homer. Verlander received a hearty ovation after ending his night with a perfect eighth before Hector Rondon took over for the ninth and finished the one-hitter.	"He was all over the strike zone, wherever he wanted to go he could go," manager AJ Hinch said. "Everything from swing-and-miss to getting into counts and really one pitch the entire night where he yanked down to Abreu and Abreu hit a ball out of the ball park. An incredible night for a guy who's fun to watch pitch."	Houston, a big league-best 33-16, won for the 12th time in 13 games overall and ninth in a row over the White Sox.	Tuesday's performance was the latest in a string of dominant starts for the 36-year-old Verlander. He's allowed just two runs and four hits while striking out 29 combined in his last three starts spanning 22 innings.	Hinch was asked where his recent work ranks in his time in Houston. Verlander is in his second full season with the Astros after a trade from Detroit late in the 2017 season.	"He's been really good so I don't know if I can put it all together in a three-outing run but I'm just glad he's ours," Hinch said. "I'm glad every five days we've got him out there pitching at an elite level. When that happens we know we can win. Where that fits in with his Astro tenure so far, I have no idea."	Covey allowed four hits, walked four and allowed four runs in four-plus innings.	Houston loaded the bases on three straight walks with no outs in the fifth, and Tony Kemp scored on a wild pitch by Aaron Bummer to make it 2-0. Alex Bregman walked before Michael Brantley scored two with a double. A single by Correa scored Bregman to extend the lead to 5-0.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: Houston placed RHP Collin McHugh on the 10-day IL with discomfort in his right elbow, retroactive to Saturday. Hinch said the team doesn't think the problem is serious and expects his stay on the IL to be short. ... 2B Jose Altuve (strained left hamstring) continues to increase his activity and could begin a rehabilitation assignment in the next few days. ... OF George Springer, who left Sunday's game with stiffness in his lower back, missed his second straight game.	THEY SAID IT	White Sox manager Rick Renteria on Verlander dominating his team on Tuesday night: "Against a former Cy Young Award winner, I think they did everything they could possibly against this guy. He was that good tonight."	UP NEXT	White Sox: RHP Ivan Nova (2-4, 7.42) will start for Chicago on Wednesday night. Nova will try and bounce back after yielding eight hits and nine runs in three innings of a 10-2 loss to Toronto in his last start.	Astros: RHP Gerrit Cole (4-4, 3.56) is scheduled to start for Houston when the series continues Wednesday. Cole, who leads the majors with 93 strikeouts, struck out seven in five scoreless innings of Houston's 3-1 win over Boston in his last start.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Joe Panik was fairly calm in the midst of his eight-pitch battle with Atlanta closer Luke Jackson. A pair of stolen bases earlier in the ninth inning, including one by pinch-runner Mac Williamson that put the winning run in scoring position, helped take the pressure off the Giants leadoff hitter.	Panik hit a game-ending two-run single off Jackson with two outs in the ninth to lift the San Francisco Giants to a 4-3 win over the Braves on Tuesday night.	"Great comeback," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "We looked pretty flat. We just couldn't get it going. To come back and win it in the ninth like that, that's huge."	Brandon Crawford began the comeback with a one-out single. After Steven Duggar struck out, Kevin Pillar singled in Crawford. Pillar stole second then moved to third on Pablo Sandoval's pinch-hit infield single. Williamson stole second before Panik slapped a 3-2 pitch from Jackson into right field to cap the three-run rally.	"Any time you can advance 90 feet it's big in that situation," Panik said. "Especially for me, having Mac at second base versus first base, I don't have to hit a double to win the game. Just stay within myself, stay through the middle of the field and you can win the game that way with a single. Every 90 feet matters."	It's the fourth blown save this season for Jackson (2-1) and spoiled an otherwise strong day by the Braves pitching staff.	Atlanta had won four straight against San Francisco and allowed one run in all four. The Braves were in position to make it five before the Giants rallied with three runs and four hits in the ninth.	The stolen bases by Pillar and Williamson provided the late lift San Francisco needed.	"Kevin, he's a base stealer but once Mac got it, now you realize it just takes a hit and you win the game," Bochy said. "You saw the energy pick up in the dugout. We did a nice job."	Panik and Buster Posey had two hits apiece for San Francisco.	Trevor Gott (2-0) retired three batters to win.	Josh Donaldson, Nick Markakis, Ronald Acuna Jr. and Dansby Swanson had two hits apiece for Atlanta.	"A foot here and a foot there and we would have won," Atlanta catcher Brian McCann said. "But it's baseball and you've got to turn the page."	Braves starter Julio Teheran struck out six and gave up three hits and one run in 5 2/3 innings. Teheran has a 0.79 ERA over his last four starts covering 22 2/3 innings. He lost three straight decisions to close out April and had a pair of no-decisions in his first two starts in May.	Acuna backed Teheran with a terrific leaping grab at the fence in center field to rob Brandon Belt of extra bases in the third.	PUT ME IN (ANYWHERE) COACH	Vogt made his second career start in left field. The 34-year-old Vogt has logged 370 games behind the plate. Wednesday marked his fifth appearance in left field and first since 2014 when he was with the Oakland Athletics.	ROSTER MOVE	The Giants placed pitcher Travis Bergen on the 10-day injured list because of a left shoulder strain. Bergen is 2-0 with a 4.24 ERA in 18 games this season. Infielder Donovan Solano was recalled from Triple-A Sacramento before the game, one day after being sent down to make room for pitcher Andrew Suarez.	UP NEXT	Braves lefty Max Fried (6-2, 2.86 ERA) makes his fifth road start Wednesday. Fried pitched two-hit ball over six scoreless innings against Milwaukee on May 17. RHP Jeff Samardzija (2-2, 3.69) makes his first start against Atlanta since 2017. Samardzija threw a season-low 68 pitches in 5 1/3 innings in his most recent start against Arizona on May 17.	--	More AP MLB:https://apnews.com/tag/MLBandhttps://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Marwin Gonzalez keeps coming through for the Minnesota Twins. The designated hitter homered and drove in three runs as the Twins rallied for an 8-3 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Tuesday night.	Gonzalez's two-run shot in the sixth tied the game at three. Minnesota then broke it open with four in the seventh off Luke Bard (1-2). Gonzalez's two hits extended his hitting streak to 11 games, which is the second-longest active streak in the majors.	The Twins have won five of six on their road trip and at 32-16 have a seven-game lead in the AL Central.	"We have one of the best offenses in the league. We can change a game in one inning and that is basically what we did today," said Gonzalez, who is batting .378 with three home runs during his hitting streak. "We're not depending on two or three guys. Everyone is capable to do good things and it is working right now."	Minnesota's first four hitters in the order combined to go 8 for 18 and drove in seven runs.	AL batting leader Jorge Polanco and Eddie Rosario each had two hits and drove in two runs while Max Kepler added two hits.	"Eventually we got to the middle of the game, able to kind of settle in and started driving the ball around the ballpark a little bit," Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said.	Luis Arraez, who made his major league debut last Saturday, had two hits, including his first home run in the eighth.	The Angels' bullpen had another rough night as it allowed seven runs on eight hits, including two home runs. Starter Trevor Cahill came into the game with 14 home runs allowed but yielded just one run on two hits in five-plus innings.	"The bullpen has been an extreme strength of ours, so I'm not gonna, after two games, claim it's a weakness," Angels manager Brad Ausmus said. "It's a pretty good offensive club we're playing against in the Twins. I'm not gonna read too much into it so we'll come back tomorrow."	Minnesota's Michael Pineda (4-3) allowed three runs the first two innings but only one hit in his final four innings.	"The first two innings I tried just attack everybody with my fastball. After that, I threw my changeup more," Pineda said.	David Fletcher had three hits for Los Angeles, which has dropped three straight. Mike Trout hit his 11th home run , a solo shot to left in the first inning off Pineda's fastball.	The Angels added a pair of runs in the second when Fletcher's single drove in Brian Goodwin and Luis Rengifo scored on a wild pitch by Pineda.	Minnesota rallied to tie it in the sixth. Max Kepler's double to right chased Cahill and Polanco followed with an RBI double. Gonzalez then drove Justin Anderson's slider down the right-field line for his fifth home run of the season.	GOING DEEP	The Twins have homered in 14 of their last 15 games and have 90 on the season, which is second in the majors. Seattle leads with 93.	NICE DEBUT	Arraez has hit safely in all four games in the majors. He has hits in 20 of his last 21 games over three levels -- Double-A Pensacola, Triple-A Rochester and the Twins.	REED TO BE RELEASED	Minnesota chief baseball officer Derek Falvey said pitcher Addison Reed will be released once he clears unconditional waivers. The right-handed reliever was designated for assignment last Thursday.	The 30-year-old Reed is getting $8.5 million the second season of a $16.75 million, two-year contract. He went 1-6 with a 4.50 ERA in 55 appearances last season.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Twins: C Mitch Garver (high left ankle sprain) took some light swings off a batting tee and some light jogging in Minneapolis.	Angels: C Kevan Smith was hit in the mask by a foul tip during the fourth inning. He was replaced by Jonathan Lucroy in the fifth.	UP NEXT	Twins: LHP Martin Perez (6-1, 2.89 ERA) has 30 strikeouts in May, which is the fifth among American League starters.	Angels: RHP Matt Harvey (1-2, 6.69 ERA) has been charged with two or fewer runs in four of his last five starts.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

SAN DIEGO --  Eric Hosmer didn't wait to jump on Zack Greinke when he got a pitch to hit.	Hosmer's two-run, opposite-field home run off Greinke highlighted the three-run sixth inning that carried the San Diego Padres to a 3-2 victory against the Arizona Diamondbacks on Tuesday night.	Greinke (6-2), who recorded his 2,500th career strikeout in the fourth, was working on a one-hit shutout when he ran into trouble in the sixth. Ian Kinsler singled with one out, advanced on Franmil Reyes' groundout and scored on Manny Machado's single. Hosmer then drove Greinke's next pitch to left field to give the Padres the lead. It was Hosmer's seventh.	"He's a guy you don't want to fall behind," Hosmer said. "We were aggressive early. We didn't miss those pitches. Ian got things going, Manny did a good job of being aggressive early and then I got a pitch to hit early in the count as well and didn't miss it. Outer half, that's where I'm always looking, trying to get something where I can get a little bit of extension going. Didn't miss it, that's that fortunate part."	The Padres won their second straight to pop back above .500. The Diamondbacks lost their fourth straight.	"It felt good to win," Hosmer said. "We're facing a team that's ahead of us right now in the division. Anytime we're playing these games we know how important they are. Against a guy like Greinke you know you're not going to have many opportunities, so it was big for us to get it going that inning."	Said Greinke: "First pitch fastball to Hosmer, probably a little bit higher than I wanted. Good swing, hit it really good and bad results."	Overall, though, he felt good about his command.	"Even the hits they got were located pretty well. Their best hitters got the hits and did a good job."	Left-hander Matt Strahm (2-3) allowed two solo homers among his four hits in six innings. He struck out two and walked none.	Kirby Yates struck out the side in the ninth for his 19th save.	Greinke allowed three runs and four hits in seven innings, struck out five and walked one. He was trying for his third win against the Padres this season. He beat them 8-5 at Petco Park on April 2, when he struck out 10 and hit two home runs.	He got Franmil Reyes swinging leading off the fourth for career strikeout 2,500.	"Haven't thought about it at all," Greinke said about the milestone strikeout. "Didn't even know it happened. A lot of times you guys can find records in every game if you try hard enough."	Manager Torey Lovullo was impressed.	"Zack was once again outstanding. He got his 2,500th strikeout. That's hard to do," the manager said. "I think we all need to sit back and appreciate exactly what that means and who's throwing for us every fifth day. He's a very special pitcher and he had everything working today. It just was a really, really good outing for him and it all blew up quickly there. He doesn't give up many home runs. He keeps a lot of balls in the ballpark."	The Diamondbacks took a 2-0 lead on long balls. Eduardo Escobar homered with one out in the fourth, his 11th, and John Ryan Murphy connected with two outs in the fifth, his fourth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: Left fielder David Peralta came out of the game with right shoulder soreness. ... INF Wilmer Flores was placed on the 10-day injured list with a bruised right foot, retroactive to Monday, and Ildemaro Vargas was recalled from the Triple-A Reno.	Padres: C Francisco Mejia (left knee strain) started a rehab assignment with Triple-A El Paso.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: RHP Merrill Kelly (4-4, 4.21) is scheduled to start the series finale Wednesday afternoon. He won his MLB debut at Petco Park on April 1.	Padres: LHP Eric Lauer (2-4, 5.24) is scheduled to make his club-leading 10th start.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

MILWAUKEE --  Yasmani Grandal's home run helped the Brewers get back in the game. But it was a bizarre double play the Milwaukee catcher started on a pitch that got past him that really saved the day.	The Brewers overcame an early five-run deficit and outlasted the Cincinnati Reds 11-9 Wednesday, with Grandal in the thick of things.	In the sixth, Grandal hit a tying, two-run homer. The Brewers then tacked on three more runs in the inning for an 11-8 lead.	The Reds scored once in the seventh and had the bases loaded with one out. Reliever Jeremy Jeffress struck out Phillip Ervin swinging, but the ball zipped past Grandal. Fortunately for the Brewers, the ball caromed off the back wall and right back to Grandal.	"The ball gets past the catcher and a lot of times as a runner, you just react," Reds manager David Bell said.	Curt Casali took off from first, assuming all the runners would advance. Derek Dietrich, however, stayed at third, seeing the ball ricochet to Grandal.	Grandal threw down to first and Casali was tagged out after a rundown.	"That's a play we work on every day," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said, laughing. "We caught a break there, 100 percent."	The game had been set up as a pitching duel between the Brewers' Zach Davies and Luis Castillo. They entered with the second-lowest (Davies, 1.54) and third-lowest (Castillo, 1.90) ERAs in the National League.	It turned out to be the shortest outing of the season for both, as Davies gave up six runs in three innings and Castillo allowed four in 2 2/3.	"They were pretty aggressive," Davies said. "That's where my pitch execution comes in and I just didn't have it today."	Castillo said he couldn't execute his changeup.	"I didn't trust that pitch today. I was using it, but more like in fastball counts," he said.	In all, Cincinnati and Milwaukee both used six pitchers. Josh Hader finished it, earning his 12th save in 12 chances.	The Brewers, shut out for the first time this season in a 3-0 loss to the Reds on Tuesday, played their second straight game without Christian Yelich. The 2018 NL MVP was out with back spasms, and it isn't known yet when he'll return.	Tucker Barnhart's fourth homer, a second-deck drive to right field, capped a five-run second that put the Reds up, 5-0. Dietrich hit his 12th in the third for a 6-1 lead.	The Brewers made it 6-all in the fourth on a two-run single by Eric Thames. Keston Hiura and Mike Moustakas also homered for Milwaukee.	Milwaukee reliever Junior Guerra (2-0) earned the win. Wandy Peralta (0-1) took the loss.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: Yelich will "go through a bunch of treatments today and see how he is," Counsell said before the game. "He's had some muscle issues in his back but they've been short-term, five-day injuries. That's not a chronic characterization, for me."	Reds: OF Yasiel Puig, who suffered a sprained right shoulder after making a catch in right field and crashing into the padded wall in Cincinnati on Sunday, didn't play Wednesday for the second straight game. Bell said he expects Puig to return to the lineup Friday after an off-day for the team on Thursday.	HITLESS AND ON BASE	Brewers LF Ben Gamel got on base four times without getting a hit, being walked twice and hit by a pitch twice.	STRUCK `EM OUT	Reds LHP Amir Garrett has recorded his last nine outs by strikeout, most recently retiring the side that way in the eighth inning on Tuesday against the Brewers. "It may not be the ninth (inning), but he's pitching in situations that are as important as they get," Bell said.	UP NEXT	Reds: The Reds head to Chicago to open a three-game series against the Cubs on Friday. Anthony DeSclafini (2-2, 4.60 ERA) faces Cubs RHP Kyle Hendricks (4-4, 3.21).	Brewers: Open a three-game series at home against the Philadelphia Phillies on Friday. The Brewers will put RHP Chase Anderson (2-0, 2.66) against RHP Jerad Eickhoff (2-2, 3.23).	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

CLEVELAND --  After making stops in three cities over 10 days on the road, Frankie Montas and the Oakland Athletics are headed home.	And they're bringing the longest active winning streak in the majors with them.	Montas pitched six scoreless innings, Mark Canha homered and drove in three, and the Athletics extended their winning streak to six with a 7-2 victory over the Cleveland Indians on Wednesday.	Oakland completed a 6-2 road trip and has won 10 of 14. Those numbers don't include a game last weekend that was suspended in Detroit with the Athletics leading 5-3 in the seventh.	"I feel like we're getting there as a team, but I'm ready to go home," Montas said, smiling. "I just want to chill and play with my son."	Nick Hundley had three hits, including a solo homer and two RBI. Robbie Grossman also drove in a pair of runs as Oakland swept the three-game series and reached the .500 mark for the first time since April 26.	"This is the type of baseball we expect to play and this is the team we envisioned being," Hundley said. "We're getting great pitching and Frankie did a real good job keeping this tough lineup off-balance."	Montas (6-2), who struck out nine mixing fastballs and sliders, has not allowed more than three earned runs in his 10 starts this season. The right-hander gave up five hits, four of them over the first two innings, in lowering his ERA to 2.40.	"Frankie has come a long way in a short period of time," Athletics manager Bob Melvin said. "He's still learning, but he's got a pretty good idea what he wants to throw in every situation, not just waiting for the sign from the catcher."	The 26-year-old said the Indians' aggressive approach played into his hands, noting, "If I threw a ball close to the zone, they were going to swing. They were swinging early, which I like."	Canha, filling in for injured designated hitter Khris Davis, homered for the second day in a row and has nine RBI in his last six games. He drove in five runs over his first 20 appearances this season.	Davis underwent an MRI on his ailing left hip but has not been put on the injured list while the team awaits the results. Melvin said he would update his status Friday.	Right-hander Jefry Rodriguez (1-4) allowed four earned runs in a season-low four innings. Cleveland's three starters racked up 317 pitches in the series -- and none lasted longer than six innings -- as Oakland belted seven home runs.	"You're certainly trying to take care of your starter, but you also know you've got to cover a certain amount of innings with your bullpen," Indians manager Terry Francona said. "I'd be lying if I said there wasn't a bunch of anxiety about it."	Cleveland's Jake Bauers hit a two-run homer off Fernando Rodney. The 450-foot shot into the visiting bullpen was the Indians' longest since 2017.	NO ANSWERS	The Indians stranded 11 runners and have the third-lowest batting average in the AL at .224. Cleveland scored nine runs in the series, dropping its season average to 3.9.	"If I had the magic potion, believe me, I'd give it to everybody," Francona said. "The best thing I know is to not drag our heads, to not feel sorry for ourselves, because nobody cares. Especially the teams we're playing. They're probably thrilled."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: LHP Brett Anderson (cervical strain) will make his next scheduled start Sunday. The 31-year-old awkwardly twisted his neck in the fifth inning Monday while avoiding both pieces of a broken bat and a baseball hit by Indians catcher Roberto Perez.	Indians: RHP Corey Kluber (right arm fracture), who was struck by a line drive on May 1 at Miami, will have an X-ray taken Thursday. The two-time AL Cy Young winner could have his hard cast replaced with a removable splint if the test reveals healing.	UP NEXT	Athletics: RHP Daniel Mengden (1-1, 3.65 ERA) takes on Mariners LHP Wade LeBlanc (2-1, 7.36 ERA) in the Friday opener of a three-game series.	Indians: RHP Adam Plutko (1-0, 1.50 ERA) makes his second start of the season Thursday in the first game of a four-game set against Tampa Bay.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ST. LOUIS --  Brad Keller snapped out of his slump for the Kansas City Royals and kept the Cardinals in their funk.	Keller threw seven-plus innings of two-hit baseball, Jorge Soler hit a three-run homer and the Kansas City Royals beat St. Louis 8-2 Wednesday in the first game of a doubleheader. The Cardinals have lost 10 of 12.	Severe storms around St. Louis forced Tuesday night's game to be postponed and created the day-night twinbill.	Keller (3-5) ended his six-start winless streak. He worked around leadoff walks in the first, second and fourth innings and had retired 12 of 13 batters before Matt Carpenter walked and Paul Goldschmidt singled to start the eighth, ending Keller's day.	"Definitely felt a lot better," said Keller, who had given up 17 earned runs in his previous five starts covering 27 1/3 innings. "More comfortable in my delivery, especially in innings three to seven. I was able to get ahead of those guys and just go after them."	After starting the season with a 20-10 record, St. Louis fell back to .500.	"We got to look at it," Cardinals manager Mike Shildt said. "Clearly, I don't want to be knee-jerk right now, but we can't continue, just in total, something's got to change."	"I can't alibi it. Got reasons, got sound reason, but reality is we're not getting it done right now. Ultimately, it's a group that we'll all take ownership, but I've got to take ownership, too. I've got to figure out something and I've got to lead better, evidently," he said.	Keller matched his longest outing of the season. He struck out three, walked four and hit two batters.	Control was Keller's biggest issue during his struggles as he walked 20 batters in his previous five starts. Though he gave up four free passes to St. Louis, the lack of contact helped him.	"Didn't allow any of that to kind of fester into trouble for him, just came back and made good pitches after that," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "Really did a good job of managing his pitch count. Really had good stuff, had the good two-seamer, had everything working for him today."	Kevin McCarthy relieved Keller and gave up a two-run double to Marcell Ozuna. The Cardinals finished with four hits, two by Matt Wieters.	Soler's drive into the left field seats off Michael Wacha (3-2) capped a six-run third and made it 7-0.	"Any time you get runs support like that you basically just go out there and say, `here it is,' and just try to get as deep into the game as possible," Keller said.	Wacha has allowed 18 earned runs and 30 hits in 25 1/3 innings in five starts since returning from the injured list with left knee patellar tendinitis.	"The way I've been pitching, it's unacceptable," Wacha said. "It's tough. You've got to be able to pitch well to stay in this league and right now I have not been pitching well. I have to do a better job."	Whit Merrifield had two hits, drove in a run and scored once. Adalberto Mondesi had two hits, drove in two and scored. Nicky Lopez reached three times and scored twice and Hunter Dozier hit a pair of sacrifice flies.	ROSTER MOVES	Royals: McCarthy, a right-hander, was recalled from Triple-A Omaha after RHP Heath Fillmyer was optioned on Sunday. RHP Jake Newberry will be the 26th man for the second game.	Cardinals: RHP Luke Gregerson cleared waivers and was given his unconditional release, making him a free agent. OF Lane Thomas will be the 26th man for the second game.	UP NEXT	RHP Homer Bailey (4-4, 5.36 ERA) will get the start for the Royals in the nightcap against RHP Adam Wainwright (3-4, 4.75 ERA). Bailey is 5-16 with a 5.56 ERA against St. Louis. Wainwright will be facing Kansas City for the first time since 2016.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

ARLINGTON, Texas --  Adrian Sampson and the Texas Rangers like the results of these delayed lengthy pitching appearances, with the right-hander entering after an "opener" gets through the first few batters.	Sampson allowed one earned run over 5 1/3 innings after taking over in the second inning Wednesday, getting his second big league victory in a 2-1 win over the Seattle Mariners. That is the same way he got his first victory five days earlier against the St. Louis Cardinals.	"As long as we get wins, everyone's happy," Sampson said.	"Whether he likes it, I don't know fully because I don't think he'll tell me like I hate this," manager Chris Woodward said. "It's so nice to have a guy like that, who's willing to come in in the middle of the inning, can come in in the middle of an inning and pitch six innings."	Hunter Pence homered for the Rangers (24-23), who completed a three-game series sweep. They have won seven of eight to get back over .500 for the first time since April 28.	The Mariners have lost 27 of 37 games to fall to the bottom of the AL West standings since starting the season 13-2.	Marco Gonzalez (5-4) limited Texas to one earned run over seven innings, but dropped to 0-4 with a 4.56 ERA in five starts in May. The lefty was 5-0 after his first seven starts this season, but this was one of his sharpest games.	"Doesn't matter. We lose, it doesn't matter. I'm not OK with it," Gonzalez said. "It's hard to be OK with it when we lose."	Pence put the Rangers up 2-0 in the sixth when he went deep on a changeup, his 10th homer of the season. Texas got an unearned run in the first when Pence reached on an error by first baseman Edwin Encarnacion and scored on a double by Nomar Mazara .	Jesse Chavez got the first five outs for the Rangers. Shawn Kelley worked the ninth for his fourth save in five chances, his second in less than 24 hours since coming off the injured list following the removal of two lumps from his throat that were determined to benign.	In five starts this season, Sampson is 0-2 with a 7.66 ERA and hasn't gone more than five innings. Pitching in relief, he is 2-1 with a 1.48 ERA. His first appearance was allowing one run over six innings in relief against Houston on April 1.	"I feel like I'm just finding comfort in pitching lately," Sampson said. "Whether I'm starting or coming out of the bullpen, I just feel good out there right now."	MAZ HIGHLIGHTS	Mazara was 6 for 12 with four doubles in the series. The right fielder also had an impressive leaping catch near the wall in the fourth of the finale. "I knew where it was and I did a good job of timing it," Mazara said.	SHORT HOPS	Seattle turned five double plays. ... Pence has at least 10 homers for the 11th time in his career. He went deep only four times last season with San Francisco. ... Chavez has pitched 11 scoreless innings in his last eight games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: C Omar Narvaez left the game with a bruised left knee. He took a foul tip off his knee in the bottom of the third, and is day-to-day. "Omar got smoked good. He got hit about a week ago in the same spot," manager Scott Servais said. ... 3B Kyle Seager, who had surgery to repair the tendon of his left middle finger during spring training, is on track for his season debut Saturday. That is when is eligible to come off the 60-day injured list. Servais said Seager felt good physically during his rehab assignment and isn't having any issues with his hand.	Rangers: OF Willie Calhoun was placed on the 10-day injured list because of a left quad strain. He hurt it as a baserunner in Tuesday night's game. ... SS Elvis Andrus (right hamstring strain) hit a solo homer in a rehab game with Double-A Frisco. He is eligible to return to the Rangers' lineup Saturday.	UP NEXT	Mariners: Seattle will be in Oakland on Friday night for the opener of a weekend series.	Rangers:  Texas starts a series Friday night at the Los Angeles Angels. LHP Drew Smyly (0-3, 6.51) is still looking for his first big league victory since 2016, before Tommy John surgery and missing the last two seasons.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.

SAN DIEGO --  With Greg Garcia having a big day for his hometown team, the San Diego Padres' offense jumped on Arizona early and helped left-hander Eric Lauer win for the first time in seven starts.	Garcia had three hits, scored twice and drove in a run while Lauer pitched seven strong innings as the Padres beat the Diamondbacks 5-2 Wednesday for a three-game sweep.	While the Padres needed sixth-inning rallies in winning the first two games of the series, they jumped on rookie Merrill Kelly early, which allowed Lauer to go a season-high seven innings.	"We weren't in desperate need to see him do that, but if the offense gives the starting pitcher a cushion it's a lot easier to give him some leash to pitch," manager Andy Green said. "Our offense did that today so you could roll with Eric through the seventh even if the matchup's not the most ideal matchup in the world."	Lauer (3-4) held the Diamondbacks to one run and four hits, struck out seven and walked none to win for the first time since April 8 at San Francisco. Since then he had three losses and three no-decisions. He allowed Eduardo Escobar's RBI double in the sixth before striking out the side in the seventh.	"That's exactly what every starter wants," Lauer said of the big early lead. "You want to pitch with the lead, you want to go out there and be comfortable, knowing that your guys are behind you scoring runs for you."	Kirby Yates got the final three outs for his major league-leading 20th save after Adam Warren allowed a run.	Eric Hosmer had a big two-run hit for the second game in a row, this time a single off rookie Merrill Kelly in the three-run first that gave Lauer all the support he needed. Garcia was aboard on a leadoff single. Rookie Ty France doubled in Hosmer.	Hosmer hit a two-run homer off Zack Greinke to help the Padres to a 3-2 victory Tuesday night.	Garcia also doubled in the second and scored on Manny Machado's sacrifice fly, and hit an RBI single in the third during a brief downpour that sent fans scurrying for cover.	"We have a great pitching staff and to give Eric some early runs was great," Garcia said. "We just kind of cruised from there and we just tried to keep adding on.	"More importantly it was just a good day for the Padres. The fact I'm from here is just kind of icing on the cake," he said. "First and foremost, winning for the Padres is the best thing ever."	Garcia went to Valhalla High in suburban El Cajon and is the grandson of the late Dave Garcia, who was a coach on the Padres' staff in the 1970s and later managed the Angels and Indians. He was claimed off waivers from St. Louis on Nov. 6.	Lauer appreciated Garcia's big game.	"It's awesome," the lefty said. "It's got to be great for him, too, to do it in front of his hometown and fans."	The Padres roughed up Kelly (4-5) for four runs and five hits in 1 2/3 innings. He walked four and struck out none.	"I think we got clipped early," manager Torey Lovullo said. "I thought Merrill just got jumped. He didn't get a chance to get into a really good rhythm and we were playing catch-up from the very beginning. We were fairly dormant for a couple of innings there. I thought the tone was definitely set in the first couple of innings."	Said Kelly: "I just didn't do my job. Coming off of some losses in a row it would have been big to get a nice quality start out of me today, and I just wasn't able to do that. Pretty much everything was off today."	Kelly beat the Padres 10-3 here on April 1.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: Lovullo said INF Wilmer Flores has a small fracture on the top of his right foot. He was placed on the injured list on Tuesday after being hit with a pitch on Sunday.	Padres: Green said he doesn't expect rookie SS Fernando Tatis Jr. to rejoin the team on its forthcoming road trip. Tatis has been out since straining his left hamstring on April 28.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: LHP Robbie Ray (3-1, 3.25) is scheduled to start Friday night in the opener of a three-game series at San Francisco.	Padres: LHP Joey Lucchesi (3-3, 4.28) is scheduled to start the opener of a three-game series at Toronto on Friday. The Blue Jays are expected to start RHP Trent Thornton (1-4, 4.41).	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

PITTSBURGH --  Another feat of strength from Josh Bell didn't do the Pittsburgh Pirates much good Wednesday night.	For the second time in two weeks, the switch-hitting slugger homered into the Allegheny River on the fly. Before then, only three balls had splashed into the river without bouncing since PNC Park opened in 2001.	The 454-foot drive with an exit velocity of 116 mph sent a buzz through the crowd, but netted just one run in the second inning of a 9-3 loss to the Colorado Rockies. It was reminiscent of May 8, when Bell hit a ball 472 feet into the water during a 9-6 loss to Texas.	"I was selling out over there tonight," Bell said. "I figured (Rockies starter Jon Gray) would kind of attack that way. It worked out in my favor."	Bell hit his 15th homer in 46 games after finishing with 12 last season, but Daniel Murphy and Tony Wolters outdid him with three-run shots in the first three innings for Colorado.	"Contributions from everybody," Rockies manager Bud Black said. "Sixteen hits, nine runs. On the attack all night."	Murphy's homer put Colorado ahead 3-0 in the first inning before Bell's titanic drive and a double from Kevin Newman cut it to 3-2 in the second. That ended the only sustained pressure against Gray (4-4), who went seven innings for the second time in 10 starts this year. He gave up three runs and seven hits with seven strikeouts.	Gray struck out Bell on three pitches in their second matchup, getting him to chase a curveball dipping out of the zone with an awkward swing leading off the fourth.	"It was another at-bat in another inning until I got to two strikes," Gray said. "Then I was kind of like, I'm going to pitch you away. I'm not going to make any mistakes here. So get ready to hit the best thing I got."	Montana DuRapau (0-1), serving as the Pirates' opener for the second time in five days, allowed Murphy's homer and lasted two outs. Nick Kingham entered and gave up six runs on nine hits in four innings.	"There's work to be done (with Kingham)," Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said. "We've seen better. We haven't seen as good lately. ... It's at a point now where he wants better, too."	Wolters broke the game open with his three-run homer with two outs in the third, extending the lead to 6-2. It was his first long ball since Aug. 27 last year.	"I'm just trying to have good at-bats," Wolters said. "I think the main thing is staying in my zone, not going out of my zone."	Brendan Rodgers doubled, and Charlie Blackmon and Raimel Tapia each singled to help tack on another three runs in the fifth.	Pittsburgh got a third run when Bryan Reynolds grounded into a fielder's choice to score Gregory Polanco in the sixth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rockies: RHP Jairo Diaz was selected from Triple-A Albuquerque. ... RHP Wade Davis was placed on the 10-day injured list with a left oblique strain. ... LHP Tyler Anderson was recalled from Triple-A and placed on the 60-day IL with a left knee chondral defect.	Pirates: RHP Keone Kela threw 21 pitches, mixing his fastball and curve, during a simulated game, Hurdle said. Kela hasn't pitched since May 4 because of shoulder inflammation. ... Polanco returned to the lineup after missing Pittsburgh's 5-0 loss Tuesday with finger discomfort in his left hand sustained against San Diego on Sunday.	UP NEXT	Rockies: RHP Antonio Senzatela (3-3, 4.89 ERA) will try to pitch Colorado to a series sweep Thursday. He's lasted more than five innings once in his past four starts, but allowed two runs (one earned) in five innings of a 2-1 loss to Philadelphia last time out.	Pirates: RHP Jordan Lyles (4-1, 1.97) has permitted one run or fewer in six of his first eight starts this season, including each of his past three.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

BALTIMORE --  Playing in a small ballpark against a struggling pitching staff, the New York Yankees went with their most obvious strength to pound out another victory.	Gleyber Torres hit two of New York's five home runs, and the Yankees beat the Baltimore Orioles 7-5 Wednesday night to secure their sixth straight series win.	New York has homered 33 times in 11 games against Baltimore this season, including 10 by Torres and nine by Gary Sanchez. The Yankees are 6-0 at Camden Yards with an astounding 25 home runs.	"We're going to hit the ball out of the ballpark," manager Aaron Boone said. "There's going to be games where we take advantage of some mistakes, and it's one of the ways we score runs. On a given night, when guys are locked in, that's something we're certainly capable of."	Torres homered leading off the third and fifth innings to help New York take a 7-2 lead. He has four multihomer games this season -- all against Baltimore.	"The ballpark is for hitters," he said.	Torres is the first player in major league history to hit 10 of his first 12 home runs in a season against the same team.	"Anytime you have that much success in a short stretch against someone, you just kind of shake your head at it a little bit," Boone said. "It's unusual and rare."	Sanchez , DJ LeMahieu and Thairo Estrada also connected for the Yankees, who lead the series 9-2 and will seek to complete a four-game sweep Thursday afternoon.	Baltimore has lost five in a row to sink to 15-34, the worst record in the majors.	CC Sabathia (3-1) allowed five runs and six hits, including two home runs, in five innings. Although his ERA climbed from 2.97 to 3.48, the lefty took advantage of New York's ample offensive display to win at Camden Yards for the first time in seven starts since June 2016.	Sabathia will likely miss his next start as he receives a cortisone shot and other medical attention for knee inflammation. Boone says the six-time All-Star could end up on the IL.	"It's like a shooting pain goes through every time that I land," Sabathia said. "So it makes it hard to finish my pitches."	Aroldis Chapman worked the ninth for his 13th save in 14 chances.	The Yankees took charge in the second inning when Estrada and LeMahieu hit two-run homers off Dan Straily (1-4), who gave up two more long balls before being pulled after four ineffective innings.	Asked to explain the success enjoyed by Torres and Sanchez, Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said, "There's definitely a pitching plan. It's definitely not to throw the ball in the middle part of the plate. We just continue to do it. When you don't do it, you get them out."	Torres hit Gabriel Ynoa's second pitch over the right field wall, the 105th home run yielded by Baltimore pitchers in 49 games. One night earlier, the Orioles broke the record held by the 2000 Kansas City Royals for quickest to allow 100 home runs (57 games).	Richie Martin hit his first big league homer and Renato Nunez added a two-run shot in the Baltimore fifth to make it 7-5.	PATIENCE REQUIRED	Orioles first-year general manager Mike Elias has no choice but to be patient while the team struggles to be competitive at the outset of a major rebuilding project.	"There have been good things this year so far. The win-loss record is not one of those good things," Elias said Wednesday. "If we're able to add a couple of guys and have them stick and be pieces here, that would make this year a huge success. But look, we've got a big effort on our hands. This is the beginning of it. That doesn't mean we're not going to push harder to get better, but it's where we're at right now."	ADDING AN OUTFIELDER	The Orioles bolstered their outfield defense by acquiring Keon Broxton from the New York Mets on Wednesday for $500,000 in 2019-20 international signing bonus pool allotment.	"He has speed, excellent center field ability, he's got some raw power," Elias said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: Giancarlo Stanton took a step back in his return from arm injuries and won't play in any rehabilitation games for seven to 10 days because of left calf tightness. ... SS Didi Gregorius (elbow) returned to the lineup in Tampa as a designated hitter in extended spring training after sitting out Tuesday due to dehydration suffered in Monday game. ... SS Troy Tulowitzki (calf), sidelined since April 3, could return to the field in some kind of game setting by this weekend. ... RHP Luis Severino (shoulder), who's yet to play this season, will likely start throwing soon.	Orioles: RHP Alex Cobb was (lumbar strain) was placed on the 60-day IL, which means he will likely sidelined until July.	UP NEXT	Yankees: Masahiro Tanaka (3-3, 3.09 ERA) returns to the mound after getting hit in the right shin by a line drive Saturday against Tampa Bay.	Orioles: Dylan Bundy (2-5, 4.66) faces the Yankees for the third time this season. The right-hander gave up three runs in 3 2/3 innings in each of his first two outings vs NY.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

TORONTO --  Michael Chavis got his team a win and his teammates some rest.	Rafael Devers joined an exclusive club of young Red Sox sluggers who have homered in three straight games, Chavis hit a tiebreaking homer in the 13th inning and Boston beat the Toronto Blue Jays 6-5 on Wednesday night.	The teams conclude their four-game series with an afternoon finale on Thursday. It's scheduled to start exactly 13 hours after Wednesday's game ended at 11:37 p.m.	No wonder Chavis was so happy about his tiebreaking homer.	"Thank goodness," he said of his reaction. "I knew it was getting late and I knew we had an early bus tomorrow for this day game. I got a lot of thank yous."	Among those expressing gratitude was fellow slugger Mookie Betts.	"Super happy," Betts said. "Try and get back and get some rest. Definitely good to get the win tonight."	Boston improved to 10-3 in its past 13 road games. The Red Sox are 4-1 in extra innings.	"This is a big win for us," Red Sox right-hander Rick Porcello said. "We've got a chance to win the series tomorrow and that's what we need to do."	Devers led off the eighth with a blast to left off Derek Law, his sixth. It made Devers the sixth player in Red Sox history aged 22 or younger to homer in three straight games. The others are Ted Williams, Babe Ruth, Carl Yastrzemski, Rico Petrocelli, and Jim Tabor.	But Marcus Walden couldn't hold a 4-3 lead for Boston in the ninth. Brandon Drury hit a one-out double and pinch-hitter Danny Jansen sent the game to extra innings with a two-out single.	Toronto used two singles and an intentional walk to load the bases against Walden with one out in the 10th. Red Sox manager Alex Cora brought Betts in to play as a fifth infielder before Walden fanned Freddy Galvis for the second out. After Betts returned to right field, Walden escaped the jam by getting Drury to fly out.	Betts put Boston back on top by connecting off Joe Biagini in the 12th, his eighth, but Rowdy Tellez tied it again with a two-out drive off Heath Hembree in the bottom half.	Chavis restored Boston's lead with a homer off Jimmy Cordero (0-1), making Hembree (1-0) the winner. Chavis has 10 homers and 25 RBI in 28 games.	According to the team, the last time the Red Sox hit multiple go-ahead home runs in extra innings of the same game was April 29, 1951, at Philadelphia, when Dom DiMaggio and Tom Wright did it in the 11th and 12th innings.	Cordero, who was claimed off waivers from Washington on May 15, was making his Blue Jays debut.	Toronto has not won back-to-back games since a three-game sweep of Oakland from April 26-28. The Blue Jays are 6-15 since.	"It was a really good game," manager Charlie Montoyo said. "I'm proud of my guys for the game we played today against one of the best teams in baseball."	Mitch Moreland had two RBI, and Jackie Bradley Jr. and Betts each scored twice for the Red Sox, who have won three of four.	Toronto rookie Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit his first home run at Rogers Centre, but that was all the Blue Jays got against Porcello, who allowed three hits in six innings.	"Rick was outstanding," Cora said.	Toronto right-hander Aaron Sanchez was forced to leave after three innings because of a blister in his previous start, May 17 against the White Sox, but said the blister didn't bother him against Boston. Sanchez, who is winless in five starts, allowed two runs and four hits in six innings.	"I can't wait for this finger issue to be behind me," Sanchez said.	Red Sox slugger J.D. Martinez was held out of the lineup because of a sore back. Martinez sat out the previous two games because of illness, but had been expected to return Wednesday. The two-time All-Star is hitting .308 with nine homers and 28 RBI.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: Chavis remained in the game after being hit on the helmet by a pitch from Sanchez in the sixth. ... INF Brock Holt (right eye) went 1 for 3 with a walk in his second straight rehab name for Triple-A Pawtucket. 2B Dustin Pedroia (left knee) went 0 for 3 with a walk and two strikeouts.	Blue Jays: Guerrero rolled his right ankle breaking out of the box on a bloop single in the sixth. He had the ankle taped between innings and remained in the game.	POWER SURGE	All five of Guerrero's home runs have come within the past eight days. The only other player aged 20 or younger to hit his first five homers within 10 days was Frank Robinson, who did it in 1956.	PUERTO RICAN PRIDE	When their teams met at Fenway Park last month, Montoyo and Cora became the first pair of Puerto Rican managers to oppose one another. Wednesday's game also featured another Puerto Rican, home plate umpire Roberto Ortiz. The three men posed for a pregame photograph.	UP NEXT	Red Sox: RHP Ryan Weber will make his first start for Boston in Thursday's series finale. Weber hasn't started since 2017, when he faced Toronto for Seattle. Weber left that start after 3 2/3 innings because of a sore shoulder.	Blue Jays: LHP Clayton Richard is expected to come off the injured list and make his season debut Thursday. Richard has not pitched this season because of a stress reaction in his right knee.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  It was a night of redemption for Kevin Kiermaier, who hit a three-run homer and made the biggest defensive play of the game to lead the Tampa Bay Rays past the Los Angeles Dodgers 8-1 on Wednesday.	One day earlier, Kiermaier's baserunning blunder took the Rays out of a 7-3 loss to the Dodgers.	"I don't think it had any carry-over," Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash said. "For him to do what he did on defense and then at the plate to really separate the game was big for us. We needed a little bit of breathing room. We haven't had much lately."	Avisail Garcia and Kiermaier each hit a three-run homer in the seventh inning to power the Rays. Kiermaier also made a rocket throw from center field to cut down Cody Bellinger at home plate, keeping the score tied 1-all in the sixth.	Bellinger, who was aboard on a fielder's choice, failed to reach base safely for the first time in 46 starts this season. He went 0 for 4, dropping his major league-leading batting average to .394.	Tommy Pham homered for the Rays, and Brandon Lowe singled in the go-ahead run to spark a seven-run seventh. Emilio Pagan (1-0) got four outs in relief.	Garcia's eighth homer came off Dylan Floro, who entered with a 0.44 ERA -- best among NL relievers. Floro (1-1) pitched to four batters and got none of them out.	"I know it's going to happen," said Floro, whose ERA spiked to 2.21. "I'm just disappointed to let the team down. I know I'm not going to be perfect every single time. This game is way too hard and it's not just a month long. You've just got to learn from it and move on."	Kiermaier capped the big inning with his fourth home run, which came off left-hander Caleb Ferguson. It was the first homer by Kiermaier off a lefty since June 25 last year.	"I always tell people it makes it even more special off a lefty. I haven't seen a whole lot lately," said Kiermaier, who has been held out of the lineup against some left-handers. "I want to be in there each and every day, and at-bats like that are going to make it tougher on them to keep me out of the lineup."	Pham led off the fourth with his sixth homer, an opposite-field shot off starter Rich Hill.	Max Muncy tied it with a home run in the sixth off Rays reliever Yonny Chirinos. It was Muncy's 10th of the season and eighth on the road.	Tampa Bay opener Ryne Stanek pitched 1 2/3 innings, giving up a hit and a walk while striking out two.	After Muncy's drive in the sixth, Bellinger kept the inning going by beating a throw to first base to prevent a double play. He tried to score the lead run on Russell Martin's two-out single, but Kiermaier threw him out.	Bellinger's 45-game on-base streak to start the season stands as the sixth-longest in major league history. The longest, 57 games, was accomplished by John Olerud of the New York Mets in 1999.	SHIFTING THOUGHTS	The first of five hits off Hill was Ji-Man Choi's bunt single down the third base line with nobody playing third. "In my opinion, I don't like to see the entire left side of the field left open," said Hill, who gave up one run in six innings. "I think hitters are getting better at understanding how to beat the shift. ... Guys are getting more savvy. We're trying to put our guys in position to have an optimal outcome. It's one of those things where you love it when it works and you hate it when it doesn't."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: RHP Pedro Baez is expected to be available Friday after being hit by a line drive just below the right knee Tuesday night. ... RHP Kenta Maeda (left adductor strain) will pitch Sunday at Pittsburgh, his first start since May 15.	Rays: 3B-1B Yandy Diaz, hit on the left hand by a pitch Sunday, was out of the lineup for the second straight game. ... INF Joey Wendle, out since April 26 with a broken right wrist, had his cast removed and will increase range of motion and strengthening drills. ... Rehabbing INF Matt Duffy aggravated his strained left hamstring and will be evaluated.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: RHP Walker Buehler (4-1, 3.83 ERA) will pitch Friday night's opener of a three-game series at Pittsburgh.	Rays: A four-game series starts Thursday night at Cleveland, where the Rays are 27-51 all-time.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

DETROIT --  For the second straight night, a Miami player celebrated his first major league homer.	Harold Ramirez hit his less than two weeks after his debut. Garrett Cooper had a much longer wait.	Cooper hit his first big league home run in the sixth inning, and that was the start of an impressive comeback by the Marlins, who rallied for their fifth straight victory, 6-3 over the Detroit Tigers on Wednesday night. Cooper played in the majors for parts of the 2017 and 2018 seasons as well, but this was only his 39th game.	"It was about time I got one," said Cooper, who has battled injuries throughout these past three seasons. "I've got a week of games under my belt right now, and finally get back to feeling how I felt the last 15 years of playing baseball, where you're playing every day."	Ramirez hit his first homer in a win Tuesday night. The Tigers led 3-0 on Wednesday before Cooper's solo shot. The Marlins then scored three runs in the seventh, and Brian Anderson added a two-run homer in the eighth.	Detroit has dropped eight in a row -- and Sunday's game was suspended with the Tigers trailing Oakland in the seventh inning.	"It's just a really rough stretch right now," Detroit manager Ron Gardenhire said. "We'll think back to this day somewhere down the road here and say, `Man that was brutal, let's not do that again.' But right now we're going through it."	Detroit starter Daniel Norris was solid, but with the Tigers up 3-1, he gave up a single to Ramirez to start the seventh. Buck Farmer (2-3) relieved him and allowed a single to Martin Prado. Then Neil Walker hit a two-run double to tie it.	One out later, Miguel Rojas put Miami ahead to stay with an RBI single. Anderson made it a three-run game with his home run in the eighth.	Jose Urena (2-6) allowed two earned runs in six innings for the Marlins. Austin Brice pitched a scoreless seventh, retiring Miguel Cabrera on a weak grounder with men on first and third for the final out. Tayron Guerrero handled the eighth, and Sergio Romo pitched a perfect ninth for his eighth save in nine chances.	Detroit scored a run in each of the first three innings. Niko Goodrum hit an RBI single, Gordon Beckham drove in a run with a groundout, and Christin Stewart added a run-scoring double.	PREGAME ANTICS	Detroit left-hander Daniel Stumpf and Miami righty Sandy Alcantara had a playful standoff before the game, standing several feet in front of their respective dugouts and not budging.	"I kind of just stand out there every time, make sure everyone walks off," Stumpf said. "It just so happened today I had someone that did not walk off. So I wasn't going to lose."	With the game about to start, an umpire eventually went over and got Alcantara to vacate his spot, and Stumpf did so, as well. Alcantara said an ump indicated he could be ejected if he didn't move, and Stumpf said the same.	"Third base umpire said get off the field or he's going to throw me out, so I was just standing there because the umpire was talking to (Alcantara). I saw him starting to move, so it looks like I'm going to hang in there," Stumpf said. "Everyone was yelling at me from the dugout saying you better not move. I wasn't going to give it up."	SEVERE WEATHER	Gardenhire expressed concern after the game about family in Oklahoma, which had dangerous weather Wednesday night.	"We're fixing to play a game and I'm watching the weather and got all my family there down in the pits that we have for them, so not much fun," Gardenhire said. "It's a pretty ugly storm going through and it's just nonstop. A lot of hail balls, you name it. But we made it through so far, so hopefully we can continue through the night."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: Something appeared to be bothering Romo on the mound during the game's final batter. Manager Don Mattingly went out to check on him, but Romo remained in the game. Mattingly said Romo has a knee issue he wears a brace for, and he was concerned about his landing area at the mound.	UP NEXT	Marlins: Trevor Richards (1-5) starts for Miami in Thursday's series finale.	Tigers: Matthew Boyd (4-4) takes the mound for Detroit. Boyd has a 3.41 ERA and an impressive 1.01 WHIP on the season.	---	Follow Noah Trister at www.Twitter.com/noahtrister	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

NEW YORK --  Rajai Davis took batting practice Wednesday afternoon in Allentown, Pennsylvania. The 38-year-old outfielder ended his night hitting a three-run homer that capped a thrilling eighth-inning rally for the New York Mets.	"It was a normal day when it started," Davis said after a memorable 6-1 win over the Washington Nationals.	Max Scherzer outpitched fellow Cy Young Award winner Jacob deGrom , who allowed Adam Eaton's home run on his fourth pitch.	Juan Lagares hit a three-run double off Nationals closer Sean Doolittle with two outs in the eighth and Davis added a three-run homer, his first in 134 career plate appearances as a pinch hitter.	New York, which had been 0-23 when trailing after seven innings, won its third straight following a five-game losing streak and a front office endorsement of oft-criticized manager Mickey Callaway. But star second baseman Robinson Cano left early with a left quadriceps injury that could send him to the injured list.	Signed to a minor league contract in the offseason, Davis had spent the season's first seven weeks at Triple-A with the Syracuse Mets, who played at Lehigh Valley on Wednesday. About 5 p.m., manager Tony DeFrancesco told Davis to get to New York -- after the Mets learned an MRI showed Brandon Nimmo had neck inflammation that would result in a stint on the injured list.	Davis originally thought DeFranceso was joking. Then he showered and called an Uber for the 112-mile trip to Citi Field that took 2 hours and, according to Davis, cost about $234. His driver, Jason, is originally from Brooklyn.	"Me and Jason, we got to know each other," Davis said. "But I'm not going to foot that bill."	Davis arrived in the third inning.	"I think I saw him in the fifth or the sixth for the first time," Callaway said.	Playing for his eighth big league team in 14 seasons, Davis couldn't find his way back to the Mets clubhouse and had to ask for directions	"I feel like I got lost for about a month and half, and two months," Davis said with a grin. "Now I'm fine."	Davis's 62nd longball made him the 11th player to homer in his first at-bat for the Mets. He and Callaway shared a dugout for another big home run -- his tying, two-run drive for Cleveland against Aroldis Chapman in the eighth inning of World Series Game 7 three years ago, a game the Chicago Cubs won in 10 innings.	"He remembers. I remember. I think they remember, too," Davis said.	Callaway was the Indians pitching coach. When it was pointed out the stakes were not quite the same, he laughed and quipped: "It felt like it to me."	Scherzer struck out nine, stranded seven runners in six innings and was removed after 109 pitches -- one shy of matching Cleveland's Trevor Bauer as the only hurlers since the start of the 2018 season to throw 110 pitches in five straight starts.	Washington's bullpen has a 6.89 ERA, and the Nationals have won just twice in 11 starts by Scherzer, who remained 2-5.	Adeiny Hechavarria doubled over left fielder Juan Soto with one out in the eighth against Kyle Barraclaugh (0-1) and Todd Frazier walked with two outs.	Doolittle hit Carlos Gomez with his first pitch, and Lagares, in an 0-for-12 slide, followed with a one-hop double to the left-center wall that made him 3 for 5 against the All-Star. Lagares is getting more playing time than expected with Michael Conforto and Nimmo on the injured list.	"I just keep working hard and stay positive and try to take advantage of every opportunity," Lagares said.	Wilson Ramos was intentionally walked, and the 38-year-old Davis, batting for Drew Gagnon (3-0), capped a nine-pitch at-bat with a drive over the left field wall. Doolitte's first 13 pitches were fastballs.	"In the context of how our season's going, it hurts even more," Doolittle said. "I'm really frustrated. I'm disgusted with myself. I let the team down, and it hurts."	Cano got hurt running to first base when he grounded out in the third following J.D. Davis' two-out double and was sent for an MRI.	"He took a few hard steps out of the box, got about halfway down the line and it grabbed on him," Callaway said.	An eight-time All-Star, Cano twice failed to run out grounders last weekend in Miami, both of them resulting in double plays.	"I'm sure that he was aware the needs to get going a little bit," Callaway said.	Four pitchers combined on a three-hitter for the Mets, who stretched their home winning streak to six.	"When you win, you have a different air about you, a different confidence and I'm definably feeling that part of it," Callaway said.	Washington has dropped to 19-30 and is 10 games under .500 for the first time since September 2011.	"It's going to turn around," manager Dave Martinez said, "but we have to believe that it will. We got to will it."	BYE	Nationals: LHP Dan Jennings, who had been designated for assignment, elected free agency.	Mets: RHP Paul Sewald was designated for assignment.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: 1B Matt Adams was 1 for 4 in his first game since May 4 after recovering from a strained left shoulder. To clear a roster spot, INF Adrian Sanchez was optioned to Double-A Harrisburg, leaving 3B Anthony Rendon as the backup shortstop. ... RHP Trevor Rosenthal, who last pitched for the Nationals on April 24 and was put on the IL with a viral infection, had an erratic one-inning appearance for Harrisburg on Tuesday, allowing two walks, a hit batter, a wild pitch and a two-run double. He likely will make another minor league appearance Thursday.	Mets: INF Jeff McNeil did not play because of a tight left hamstring.

ST. LOUIS --  Marcell Ozuna made Homer Bailey work. Then he made him pay.	Ozuna and Matt Carpenter went deep as part of a four-homer barrage and the St. Louis Cardinals split a doubleheader with the Kansas City Royals by winning the second game 10-3 on Wednesday night.	Brad Keller threw seven-plus innings of two-hit ball to snap a six-start winless streak and Jorge Soler hit a three-run homer as the Royals beat the Cardinals 8-2 in the first game.	Severe storms around St. Louis forced Tuesday night's game to be postponed and created the day-night twinbill.	Ozuna capped a 12-pitch at-bat by blasting a three-run homer off Bailey over the right field wall to give the Cardinals a 3-0 lead in the first. Carpenter set the tone against Bailey, who threw 42 pitches in the inning, with a nine-pitch walk.	"Just be ready and working hard and right now try not to do too much," Ozuna said. "I'm just trying to put the ball in play and make contact because that last two series I've struck out a lot."	Ozuna also doubled, walked and scored twice. He drove in the Cardinals' only runs in the first game, giving him five RBI on the day.	"It's more of a momentum game than maybe people realize," Cardinals manager Mike Shildt said. "We kept it going, finished out, which says something about the group. Finished out the first game, kept playing. And that's a good sign when you keep playing the game when it's not going your way. Good things will happen. Ozuna picked right up."	Dexter Fowler and Kolten Wong also homered as St. Louis had as many home runs in the second game as it did hits in the opener.	Getting the early lead was a jolt of positive energy for the Cardinals, who had lost 10 of their last 12 games entering the second game.	"After we lost that game before, we got an early shot and we put some (runs) on the board," Ozuna said. "That's pretty impressive."	Adam Wainwright (4-4) battled through control issues with 55 of his 103 pitches going for strikes. In five innings, he allowed three runs, six hits, walked four and struck out two.	"We had a 5-0 lead and I needed to go at least seven today to help this team out, help this bullpen, and I didn't go that way so I'm a little disappointed," Wainwright said.	John Gant, Andrew Miller, Carlos Martinez and John Brebbia combined for four scoreless innings of relief.	"They're interchangeable," Shildt said. "It's a strong bullpen. We obviously know that we want certain matchups with certain guys and it allows us to be able to do that."	Carpenter's two-run homer in the second inning landed in the right field bullpen. Fowler added a solo homer in the sixth as part of a three-hit night. Wong's three-run homer capped a four-run seventh.	Bailey (4-5) threw 66 pitches, but lasted just 1 2/3 innings and gave up five runs. The right-hander has allowed 10 earned runs in his last two starts (six innings) and he hasn't beaten St. Louis since 2014 (eight starts).	"They kept fouling pitches off, fouling pitches off," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "Ozuna I think had a 12-pitch at-bat. In that (first) inning I thought his stuff was pretty good, but the pitch count jumped up so quick, 42 pitches in the first inning. It just jumped up to the 65 mark after five outs. Just a lot of pitches."	Hunter Dozier's 10th home run of the year off of Wainwright in the fifth inning travelled 420 feet. Adalberto Mondesi had a pair of hits, scored and drove in a run.	ROSTER MOVES	Royals: RHP Kevin McCarthy was recalled from Triple-A Omaha after RHP Heath Fillmyer was optioned on Sunday.	Cardinals: RHP Luke Gregerson cleared waivers and was given his unconditional release, making him a free agent.	UP NEXT	Royals: RHP Jakob Junis (3-5, 5.69 ERA) kicks off a three-game series against the New York Yankees, who have not named a starter, on Friday night. Junis has lost his last three starts.	Cardinals: RHP Miles Mikolas (4-4, 4.88 ERA) will look to bounce back in the opener of a three-game set against the Atlanta Braves and RHP Mike Foltynewicz (0-3, 6.91 ERA). Miles gave up seven runs in a career-low 1 1/3 innings in his last start at Texas last Friday.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

CHICAGO --  Cole Hamels wasn't sharp. The Chicago Cubs compensated with power and a solid bullpen effort.	Hamels struggled in his first start against his original team, Albert Almora Jr. hit his first career grand-slam and the Cubs rallied from an early three-run deficit with three homers, beating the Philadelphia Phillies 8-4 Wednesday night.	With the game tied at 3 in the fifth, Almora launched Cole Irvin's changeup into the shrubs in the center-field batter's eye. The 25-year-old Almora popped out of the dugout for a curtain call and doffed his helmet to an ovation from the crowd of 39,246.	Irvin got Almora to ground out with the bases loaded and two outs in the first, but not a second time.	"I didn't want to leave six men out there (on base) just on myself," Almora said. "(Irvin) was good getting me out with the changeup. I saw everything else pretty well, so I told myself see the changeup."	Anthony Rizzo hit his 12th homer, a mammoth shot in the third inning that struck the neon beer sign atop the right field scoreboard, tying it at 3-all. That allowed Hamels to escape with a no-decision and remain unbeaten this season, despite allowing three runs on nine hits and two walks through four innings.	"It literally almost knocked out the sign," manager Joe Maddon said.  "He got the `D' (in the sign)."	Javier Baez added a solo shot in the seventh. He started at shortstop after being held out of the lineup for two games with a bruised right heel.	Tyler Chatwood (3-0) earned the win with four innings of one-run, three-hit relief. Steve Cishek worked around a single and got the final three outs.	Chatwood seems to be overcoming control problems that have haunted him in the past.	"Chatty came in and really was outstanding," Maddon said. "Great command. Great stuff. A lot of movement."	Andrew McCutchen had three hits, including a solo homer off Chatwood in the eighth. Jean Segura extended his hitting streak to 13 games with a single and a double as the Phillies dropped their second straight to Chicago in a four-game series between division leaders.	Irvin (2-1) was roughed up for seven runs on seven hits after winning his first two starts following his recall from Triple-A.	"Just wasn't executing what I needed to," Irvin said. "The off-speed I wasn't locating. Fastball I wasn't locating. That's a recipe for trouble when you're facing a lineup like that."	After 99 pitches on a warm night, Hamels was replaced by Chatwood to start the fifth.	Hamels was 114-90 for the Phillies from 2006-15 after they signed him as a first-round pick in the 2002 amateur draft. He helped Philadelphia win the 2008 World Series and the 2009 NL pennant before being traded to Texas in July 2015 and then to the Cubs last July.	The lefty said facing the Phillies wasn't a big distraction "because it had been so long and the team has kind of changed over."	Hamels has more pressing concerns.	"The past couple of weeks, I just haven't been able to really locate my fastball," Hamels said, "and with that everything else just doesn't have the same sort of sharpness behind it."	The left-hander labored through a 38-pitch first inning as the Phillies jumped out to a 1-0 lead on J.T. Realmuto's ground-rule double into the vines on the right-center wall.	Philadelphia tacked on two more runs in the third against their former ace. Segura led off with a double and Bryce Harper followed with a drag bunt single under Hamels' glove. Rhys Hoskins and Cesar Hernandez hit RBI singles up the middle.	Rizzo started Chicago's comeback with his homer to right. He crushed Irvin's 3-0 fastball following singles by Kyle Schwarber and Kris Bryant.	NO-NO MEMORIES	Hamels' threw a no-hitter against the Cubs at Wrigley Field in his final start for the Phillies on July 25, 2015.  He struck out 13 and walked two in the 5-0 victory, then was dealt to Texas days later.	A FIRST	Irvin stroked a single up the middle in the second for his first major league hit.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies:  RHP Vince Velasquez (right forearm strain) threw a bullpen session on Wednesday and is scheduled to throw another on Friday in Milwaukee.  The 26-year-old was 1-2 with a 3.86 ERA in six starts before going on the IL retroactive to May 8 and said he expects to be back in the starting rotation when he returns. "That's my spot," Velasquez said. "I believe that 100%." But manager Gabe Kapler said, "I don't see it as a right."	Cubs: Placed LHP Xavier Cedeno on the 10-day IL with left wrist inflammation and recalled RHP Rowan Wick from Triple-A-Iowa.  Wick was 0-0 with a 2.84 ERA in 13 relief outings for Iowa. . RHP Pedro Strop (strained left hamstring) threw a successful 25-pitch bullpen session on Wednesday and is expected to toss another this weekend.	UP NEXT:  Phillies RHP Aaron Nola (4-0, 4.47) faces Cubs LHP Jon Lester (3-2, 2.09) in the series finale on Thursday afternoon. Lester is 8-0 with a 1.49 ERA in 10 career starts against the Philadelphia.  Nola has allowed just one run in four of his last five starts and is 2-0 with a 2.30 ERA over the span.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

HOUSTON --  The Chicago White Sox used a rare combination to beat the Houston Astros on Wednesday night.	Charlie Tilson hit a grand slam for his first career homer and the White Sox turned the only triple play in the majors this season during a 9-4 victory.	It's the first time in franchise history the White Sox have smacked a grand slam and pulled off a triple play in the same game -- and only the fourth time a major league team has done it since 1979. The last club to accomplish the feat was the Detroit Tigers on Sept. 8, 2017.	"The guys today swung the bats very well," manager Rick Renteria said. "All around just a pretty good game with a few double plays and a triple play to boot."	Eloy Jimenez homered twice for Chicago, and Tilson's slam highlighted a six-run sixth inning.	A night after managing just one hit in a 5-1 loss, the White Sox got going early in this one, with Jimenez connecting in the second inning and Jose Abreu adding a solo shot in the fourth to give them a 2-0 lead.	The Astros got a homer from Alex Bregman in a three-run fourth to go on top before Chicago's big inning.	Leury Garcia got things started in the sixth with a single and went to second on an error by left fielder Michael Brantley. The White Sox tied it at 3 when Garcia scored on a single by Yoan Moncada.	Abreu singled before Gerrit Cole (4-5) was chased by James McCann's RBI double that put Chicago up 4-3. He was replaced by Josh James, who walked Yonder Alonso to load the bases. There were two outs when Tilson, who has played 58 games over three big league seasons, launched a 98 mph fastball into the right field seats to extend the lead to 8-3.	"It was very special," Tilson said. "A long time coming, but couldn't have asked for a better moment to do it."	Jimenez, who was 0 for 7 in his first two games after spending almost a month on the injured list with an ankle problem, added a second solo homer in the eighth for the rookie's second career multihomer game.	"It was a couple of tough days, especially yesterday," Jimenez said. "It was good for me because it was against one of the best pitchers, too. He's got really good stuff."	White Sox starter Ivan Nova (3-4) allowed 10 hits but just three runs in seven-plus innings to bounce back after giving up nine runs in his previous start. He was helped by a defense that turned four double plays and ended the third inning with Chicago's first triple play since July 2016 against Atlanta.	With runners on first and second, speedy Jake Marisnick hit a grounder down the third base line to Moncada. He stepped on the bag for the first out and threw to Yolmer Sanchez at second. Sanchez relayed to first, where the ball just beat Marisnick.	"It takes a perfect alignment of the stars," Astros manager AJ Hinch said. "It was not our night."	Because he was in the perfect spot to grab Marisnick's grounder, Moncada thought the White Sox might be able to get three outs as soon as he touched third.	"Honestly, yes," he said through a translator. "I just reacted and from there the play was easy."	Houston last hit into a triple play on April 19, 2018, against the Mariners.	Cole yielded seven hits and six runs while striking out seven in five-plus innings.	"I was just off," he said. "It wasn't a good night. I wasn't synced up enough in my delivery."	Abreu, who broke up Justin Verlander's no-hit bid with a homer in the seventh inning Tuesday night, went deep with one out in the fourth to make it 2-0.	Bregman cut the lead to one on his homer with one out in the fourth. Brantley followed with a single before scoring on a double by Carlos Correa to tie it. Correa, who reached third on the throw home, evaded a tag to score on a sacrifice fly by Aledmys Diaz that put Houston on top 3-2.	Bregman's homer extended Houston's streak of games with at least one to 19, which ties the longest run in franchise history. The Astros also homered in 19 straight games in 2017.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: OF George Springer took swings for the first time since leaving Sunday's game with stiffness in his lower back. Hinch said Springer is improving but still day to day. ... 2B Jose Altuve (hamstring) did extensive running and is moving closer to a rehab assignment.	THEY SAID IT	Hinch on all the double plays and the triple play the White Sox turned: "Four plus one. That's a lot of outs. They come fast ... it ends rallies. The craziest one when you have Jake up and he hits a bullet down the line. He's standing there, and that should have been a sign of bad things to come."	UP NEXT	White Sox: RHP Lucas Giolito (5-1, 3.35 ERA) pitches the series finale Thursday. Giolito allowed three hits and one run over five innings against the Blue Jays in his last start to extend his winning streak to a career-high four games.	Astros: RHP Corbin Martin (1-0, 3.86) is scheduled to make his third career start. The rookie yielded five hits and three runs in four innings last time out against the Red Sox.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Atlanta Braves left-hander Max Fried has received more run support this season than any other pitcher in the National League. Dansby Swanson and Freddie Freeman -- with some help from San Francisco's defense -- helped keep that trend going on a night when Fried wasn't his sharpest.	Swanson and Freeman hit back-to-back homers in the second inning, when Atlanta scored six unearned runs after San Francisco botched a double play, and the surging Braves beat the Giants 9-2 on Wednesday night.	"My off-speed stuff wasn't as sharp and I didn't throw strikes as much as I would have liked," Fried said. "But I was obviously picked up big time. The offense was incredible. It was just a good team win."	One day after closer Luke Jackson blew a two-run lead in the ninth inning of a 4-3 loss, the Braves jumped out to an early lead and coasted to their ninth victory in 12 games to pull within 1 1/2 games of first-place Philadelphia in the NL East.	Fried allowed two runs in six innings for his third straight win and NL-leading seventh overall. Fried (7-2) also collected his first career RBI with a bases-loaded fielder's choice as part of Atlanta's big inning.	Swanson also provided a spark with two hits, including his eighth home run, a three-run drive to center field. Freeman, who singled in the first, followed with his team-leading 12th. Freeman has gone deep in five of the last seven games.	The two home runs came after Giants starter Jeff Samardzija (2-3) extended the inning with a pair of tosses that went awry. Samardzija made a throwing error after fielding Ozzie Albies' sharp comebacker with one out. San Francisco was in a defensive shift, but third baseman Evan Longoria appeared to stop short of the bag at second when Samardzija made the throw.	"Just a weird play," Samardzija said. "There are a lot of great things about these shifts but sometimes it does take guys out of the double play position. That's kind of what happened. It was just a freak thing."	Three batters later, Ronald Acuna Jr. struck out but reached on a wild pitch by Samardzija. Swanson and Freeman followed with the second set of back-to-back home runs for the Braves this season.	"That's what good teams do," Freeman said. "They have to capitalize on the mistakes and that's what we did tonight."	Braves manager Brian Snitker was pleased to see his team pounce on the mistakes.	"The extra outs in an inning are huge," Snitker said. "It always worries me when you score like that early because there's so much time to come back. That's why I credit Max. He went to work and he didn't let them back in the game."	Fried had only two clean innings and walked two with five strikeouts. Newly acquired reliever Anthony Swarzak retired three batters. Dan Winkler and Josh Tomlin pitched one inning apiece.	Austin Riley also homered for the Braves, hitting a three-run homer off Derek Holland in the seventh.	Acuna helped out on defense with a pair of tough catches at the center field wall.	Buster Posey had an RBI single for San Francisco but was thrown out trying to reach second. Atlanta right fielder Nick Markakis made a barehanded grab after the ball caromed off the brick wall and made a strong throw to Swanson, who tagged Posey as he was sliding in.	Tyler Austin homered for the Giants.	Samardzija had seven strikeouts and gave up four hits and two walks in six innings.	"I know he gave up six but we gave them too many outs during that second inning," San Francisco manager Bruce Bochy said. "That was some of his best stuff, I thought."	POWERING UP	Atlanta has hit six home runs in the first three games of the series. The Braves began Wednesday tied for sixth in the NL with 66. "It's a new trait in our club, all the home runs," Snitker said. "It's good."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Braves: 3B Josh Donaldson had the night off.	Giants: 1B Brandon Belt was rested before pinch hitting in the ninth. ... 2B Joe Panik got the night off.	UP NEXT	Madison Bumgarner (3-4, 4.21 ERA) pitches Thursday for the Giants and has won seven consecutive decisions against the Braves. The big lefty last lost to Atlanta in 2012.

NEW YORK --  Turns out, the only thing Mets manager Mickey Callaway lost this week was his voice.	Days after New York's front office declared support for its criticized, second-year skipper, Callaway's players rallied for another startling victory Thursday and a four-game sweep of the division-rival Nationals.	Carlos Gomez slipped out of his shoe during an early dash, then hit a go-ahead, three-run homer in the eighth inning that helped the Mets overcome a comeback that started after Washington manager Dave Martinez's heated ejection for a 6-4 victory.	Gomez bolted around the bases, smacking himself in the helmet and letting out a few joyous shouts after his two-out shot against Wander Suero (1-4). Players jumped out of the dugout and danced on the warning track while he rounded the bases, greeting him with flying handshakes and hugs.	Callaway was already hoarse Thursday morning when he met with reporters. After Gomez's stunner, he could hardly get his pipes working.	"Sorry for the voice," he said. "I've been screaming and yelling (through) these crazy games."	Gomez delivered his first homer of the season in his seventh game. The 13-year major league veteran opened the year with Triple-A Syracuse, hoping to extend his playing days at Citi Field after breaking into the majors with the Mets as a 21-year-old in 2007.	"I'm blessed," Gomez said. "Came back here in this situation and play the way that we're playing right now with a lot of energy, you know, I'm enjoying every single time. You guys can notice when I'm in the dugout or playing defense like a little kid. I'm enjoying every single moment."	It was the third straight game New York beat Washington in its final turn at-bat.	The Nationals seemed as if they'd snapped from their funk after Martinez's ejection in the eighth. Plate umpire Bruce Dreckman rang up Washington's Howie Kendrick for a strikeout as he tried to check his swing leading off, then tossed the veteran infielder. Martinez charged from the dugout, spiked his hat and kicked dirt on home plate while barking relentlessly at Dreckman.	"I just didn't think he swung," Martinez said. "We just got into it. All I did was tell him to ask for help. That's why the first base umpire is there. He didn't like it."	Juan Soto then walked against Robert Gsellman (1-0), Victor Robles singled, and Yan Gomes brought in Soto with a double. Gerardo Parra followed with a pinch-hit, two-run single for a 4-3 Washington lead.	The Nationals have lost five straight and six of seven. Washington dropped to 19-31, a record better than only the Miami Marlins, Baltimore Orioles and Kansas City Royals.	Hardly the kind of start expected from an NL playoff hopeful.	"You can't put a blame on one thing," Martinez said when asked where culpability fell. "You really can't. This is a team thing."	The Mets swept the Nationals/Expos franchise over four games for the first time since July 1-4, 1991. It was the first four-game home sweep by New York in the series since May 15-18, 1972.	New York is 18-13 against the NL East and 24-25 overall. The Mets enter a three-game series against Detroit hoping to climb over .500 for the first time since May 2.	"Now we're winning ballgames, there's definitely a different air because of that," Callaway said. "But these guys have not quit one time. They're tremendous. That's an unbelievable comeback right there."	Edwin Diaz retired the side in order in the ninth for his 12th save.	Mets starter Steven Matz allowed 10 hits over six innings of one-run ball. Washington starter Stephen Strasburg allowed two runs and five hits over seven innings.	Starting with an unusual 12:10 p.m. first pitch, both teams looked short on caffeine. New York had two errors, Washington had one and both teams had players thrown out on the bases.	SHOE FLY DON'T BOTHER	Gomez stole second in the fifth inning and took third on catcher Gomes' throwing error, and his left shoe flew off in the process.

PITTSBURGH --  After scoring just three runs in the first two games of their series with the Colorado Rockies, the Pittsburgh Pirates' offense broke out in a big way on Thursday, setting new season highs for runs scored and margin of victory in a 14-6 win.	The offensive explosion was needed after the Rockies came back from an 8-0 deficit with a six-run sixth to make things interesting. But Josh Bell, Bryan Reynolds and Starling Marte all homered in the seventh to lead the Pirates to victory.	Bell continued his torrid May by leading off the seventh with a solo home run, his 16th of the season and 10th of the month. He finished with three hits, including a double, a walk and two RBI and is slugging .718, third-best in the majors.	"I've seen some pretty special things," Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said of Bell's hot stretch. "This would be right in that category. . It's been fantastically fun to watch."	Reynolds followed Bell's shot with a three-run homer to right-center field, his first career pinch-hit homer. Marte then hit a two-run shot to left, with all three homers coming against Colorado reliever Carlos Estevez.	?"It was a good day to hit. Everybody up and down was crushing the ball," Reynolds said. "To bounce back and put some runs back on them and get a little cushion, it's big."	The Pirates got out of the gate hot, scoring four runs in the first. Gregory Polanco hit a two-run home run, Melky Cabrera hit a run-scoring double and Colin Moran drove him in with a single.	In the third, Moran hit another RBI single and after Kevin Newman worked a 10-pitch walk to load the bases, Lyles helped his own cause with a ground ball down the first-base line that scored two more runs and made it 7-0.	Rockies starter Antonio Senzatela (3-4) allowed eight runs over 3 1/3 innings and struck out two.	"He just couldn't seem to get any momentum going as far as stringing pitches together," Colorado manager Bud Black said. "It was a tough day."	With two outs in the sixth, seven straight Rockies reached base against Lyles and reliever Geoff Hartlieb. Brendan Rodgers had a two-run single that chased Lyles and pinch-hitter Daniel Murphy drove in two more to draw the Rockies to within two.	"I think that's the good thing about our team," Rockies third baseman Nolan Arenado said. "We're pretty resilient. We're always going to fight. Try to have good quality at bats up there. We never gave up."	Lyles had worked a two-hitter through five before the Rockies' big sixth inning. He finished with seven strikeouts.	"They made me have a sour taste in the sixth inning to end my outing," Lyles said. "Pretty free and easy going one through five, but I wasn't able to close the door."	TURNING POINT	With the Pirates clinging to a two-run lead in the seventh, Trevor Story and David Dahl started the inning with singles off reliever Kyle Crick, bringing up Arenado with no outs.	Crick induced a ground ball that came right back to the mound and pivoted to second to start a 1-4-3 double play. He then struck out Raimel Tapia to strand Story.	"I was just trying to get him to hit in on the ground," Crick said. "Nolan is not the fastest guy. I knew if I could get (Adam) Frazier a good throw, he could turn it."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rockies: RF Charlie Blackmon was removed from the game in fourth inning with a right calf injury.	Pirates: C Francisco Cervelli (chest contusion) missed his second consecutive game after being hit with a foul tip on Tuesday.	UP NEXT	Rockies: Colorado is expected to recall RHP Jeff Hoffman (0-1, 7.20 ERA) from Triple-A Albuquerque to start a three-game series at home against Baltimore.	Pirates: Pittsburgh has not announced a starter for Friday's game against the Los Angeles Dodgers.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

BALTIMORE --  Perhaps figuring that Gleyber Torres and Gary Sanchez were worn out from circling the bases, Yankees manager Aaron Boone wrote out a starting lineup without both sluggers in the finale of a four-game series against the Baltimore Orioles.	The benefit of such a move was that both were available when Boone really needed them.	Torres and Sanchez fueled a ninth-inning uprising that featured a bases-loaded walk, and New York pulled out a 6-5 victory Thursday to complete a sweep of the Orioles, who found yet another way to lose.	After combining to hit 19 home runs against Baltimore this season, Torres and Sanchez watched from the dugout following a quick turnaround from a game on Wednesday night. Boone finally called for the duo after Mychal Givens struck out the first two batters in the ninth with the score tied.	Torres drew a walk and Sanchez singled before Givens walked DJ LeMahieu to load the bases. After going 3-0 on Aaron Hicks, Givens got two strikes before missing badly outside .	That sent Torres to the plate for the pivotal run and moved Sanchez to third.	"Obviously, you always like when they're in the lineup but to have them sitting over there in that spot was nice," Boone said. "They were up hitting getting ready, getting prepared for that at-bat right there, and they went up and had good ones."	Clint Frazier and Luke Voit homered for the Yankees, who went deep 13 times during the series. New York has hit 35 home runs in going 10-2 against the Orioles, outscoring Baltimore 86-50.	Down 4-1 in the eighth, the Orioles mounted a surprising comeback. Two walks and an RBI single by Trey Mancini brought in Tommy Kahnle (2-0) from the bullpen, and Renato Nunez tied it with a three-run drive .	That merely delayed the inevitable -- another Baltimore loss at the hands of New York. Some have been blowouts, others close, but the past nine have all had the same result.	"We're just not there yet," manager Brandon Hyde said.	In many of the previous defeats, the Yankees bludgeoned the Orioles into submission. In this one, Hicks didn't have to take the bat off his shoulder.	"I was looking to do damage (but) in those situations you've got to stay within yourself and do what you can to help the team," Hicks said.	Zack Britton worked the ninth for his second save.	Baltimore has lost six straight. The Orioles own both the worst record in the majors (15-35) and at home (6-19).	"We're in a mode right now of `let's see what we have' and the next thing is developing to win and winning close games," Hyde said.	Yankees starter Masahiro Tanaka gave up one run and five hits in six innings. Coming off a start against Tampa Bay in which he took a line drive off the shin, Tanaka was hit by a comebacker off the bat of Rio Ruiz in the second. Boone said the ball hit the pitcher's hand, and drove it back into his chest.	Tanaka picked up the ball and threw wildly to first to help Baltimore take a 1-0 lead.	The Yankees were far more concerned about his health than the run. Fortunately, the right-hander needed only a few practice throws before resuming his domination of the Orioles.	A solo shot by Frazier in the fifth inning evened the score, and Gio Urshela chased Orioles starter Dylan Bundy with a two-run single in the sixth.	ROSTER MOVE	The Orioles optioned OF Joey Rickard to Triple-A Norfolk after the game and will probably activate OF Keon Broxton on Friday. Broxton was acquired from the Mets on Wednesday in a trade.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: LHP CC Sabathia was placed on the 10-day IL with right knee inflammation. Boone hopes treatment and rest will solve the issue and cost the pitcher just one start. ... RHP Dellin Betances (shoulder) threw 120 feet from flat ground before the game. ... SS Troy Tulowitzki (calf), sidelined since April 3, is gearing up for game action and Boone said he will likely know where and when that should be by this weekend. ... SS Didi Gregorius (elbow) had six errorless chances in the field Thursday during an extended spring training game against the Phillies.	UP NEXT	Yankees: Having won six straight series, New York takes aim at the Royals in a three-game set that begins Friday with the Yankees' starting pitcher yet to be named.	Orioles: John Means (5-4, 2.68 ERA) helps Baltimore launch interleague play with a matchup in Colorado on Friday night.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

TORONTO --  Red Sox manager Alex Cora was hoping to get four or five decent innings out of spot starter Ryan Weber.	The unheralded right-hander gave Boston a whole lot more.	Weber pitched six impressive innings to earn his first career win as a starter, Steve Pearce homered and had three RBI and the Red Sox beat the Toronto Blue Jays 8-2 on Thursday.	"Just giving the team a chance to win and saving the bullpen was really my main goal," Weber said. "I'm excited and proud of what I did."	Weber's only other big league win came with Atlanta in 2016.	Cora, whose team won a 13-inning game Wednesday and has a weekend series with AL West leaders Houston looming, was happy to give his overworked bullpen a breather.	"Those are the games that set you up for the rest of the week," Cora said.	Weber (1-0) allowed one run on three hits, walked none and struck out four.	Weber, who had made three relief appearances for Boston this season, started for the first time since May 13, 2017, when he pitched for Seattle against Toronto. Weber left that game after 3 2/3 innings because of a nerve problem in his arm.	"It felt like I got shot," Weber said.	Thursday's start gave Weber a chance to wipe that bad memory away.	"Getting back out there at Rogers Centre and going six and getting a win, that was big for me," he said.	This was Weber's ninth career big league start. He was 0-4 with a 5.40 ERA in the previous eight.	Pearce had three hits. He singled in the fourth and sixth innings and hit a two-run shot off Ryan Feierabend in the ninth, his first of the season. Pearce was last year's World Series MVP, but has struggled for most of this season after starting the year with a calf injury.	"He's in a good place," Cora said of Pearce, who has six hits in his past four games after collecting seven hits in his first 20 games.	"It feels good to get the ball rolling in the right direction," Pearce said. "I've put in a lot of work this season and I'm glad to finally start seeing the results."	Rafael Devers had two hits, two RBI and scored twice as Boston improved to 11-3 in its past 14 road games. The Red Sox have hit 29 home runs over that span.	The struggling Blue Jays lost for the third time in four games, and fell 10 games below .500 for the first time this season. Toronto is 6-15 in May.	Toronto opened the scoring on an RBI double by Freddy Galvis in the third. Weber responded by setting down the next six straight, and 15 of the next 16, before turning it over to Travis Lakins.	"Things could have got out of hand early in the game and he buckled down and got out of the big jam," Pearce said. "Hats off to him, he did a terrific job."	Lakins, Ryan Brasier and Hector Velazquez each worked one inning.	Blue Jays left-hander Clayton Richard was activated off the injured list to make his first start of the season. Limited to 60 pitches, he allowed one run and two hits in four innings, walked two and struck out two.	"Physically I felt great," Richard said. "Clearly, mechanically, there were some issues. I didn't command the ball as well as I would like to."	Boston tied it on an RBI groundout by Michael Chavis in the third, then took a 3-1 lead with a two-run sixth against Sam Gaviglio (3-1).	Red Sox outfielder Jackie Bradley Jr. had two hits and scored a run. Bradley went 6 for 18 with two homers in the four-game series.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: Boston put RHP Tyler Thornburg (right hip) on the 10-day injured list and recalled Lakins from Triple-A Pawtucket.	Blue Jays: Richard went on the injured list March 29 because of a stress reaction in his right knee. ... OF Randal Grichuk got the day off.	ROSTER REPORT	Toronto optioned right-hander Jimmy Cordero to Triple-A Buffalo to make room for Richard. Cordero took the loss in Tuesday's 13-inning defeat, his Blue Jays debut. During the game, Toronto claimed left-hander Zac Rosscup on waivers from Seattle and designated Cordero for assignment.	SWITCHED FOR STANLEY	The Red Sox have moved up the start time of their May 29 game against Cleveland by one hour, from 7:10 to 6:10 p.m. The change was made so fans could also watch Game 2 of the Stanley Cup finals, which begins at 8 p.m.	UP NEXT	Red Sox: LHP Chris Sale (1-5, 4.31) looks for his first win in four outings when he starts the opener of a three-game series in Houston. LHP Wade Miley (4-2, 3.51) starts for the Astros.	Blue Jays: RHP Trent Thornton (1-4, 4.41) starts the opener of a three-game interleague series against San Diego. LHP Joey Lucchesi (3-3, 4.28) will pitch for the Padres.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

DETROIT --  A day after hitting his first major league home run, Garrett Cooper connected again.	In grand fashion, too.	Cooper hit a grand slam with two outs in the ninth inning and the Miami Marlins won their sixth in a row, rallying past Detroit 5-2 Thursday to finish a terrible homestand for the Tigers.	Cooper jumped up and down up the first base line as his ball sailed into the left field seats.	"Probably one of the better feelings, I think I pimped it a little bit," Cooper said. "As soon as I got it off the bat, I knew I got it pretty good."	The Marlins, who had the worst record in the majors last week, extended the longest active winning streak in the big leagues.	The Tigers wrapped up an 0-9 stay at Comerica Park against Houston, Oakland and the Marlins. That record doesn't include a suspended game in which Detroit trails Oakland in the late innings.	Cooper homered off Shane Greene (0-2), who had been 15 for 15 on save chances this season.	"I just got to pitch better," Greene said. "It's my job to close the door there and I couldn't do it."	Instead, Cooper homered on an 0-1 pitch.	"As I walked in and told those guys, this is really hard," Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire said. "We have to stick together, we have to have each other's backs. There's kids in there that are really upset. They know how the game went, they know what happened. We have to have their backs and I have their backs."	The mistakes were made by third baseman Dawel Lugo and second baseman Ronny Rodriguez, who made their debuts last season and have 124 big league games between them.	It was 2-0 when Harold Ramirez opened the inning with a grounder that Lugo misplayed for an error. Ramirez scored on Neil Walker's single.	Greene later induced a double-play ball to Rodriguez that would've ended the game. But Rodriguez bobbled it and Miguel Rojas was called safe at first, which was held up on replay.	"The only person I'm pointing the finger at today is myself," Greene said. "I just got to make a pitch and pick up the team there and I couldn't do it."	After an intentional walk to pinch-hitter Curtis Granderson loaded the bases, Cooper took Greene deep.	On Wednesday, Cooper hit a home run in the sixth inning to spark a 6-3 comeback win in his 39th career game.	"It's been an up-and-down roller coaster this past year and a half," he said. "Just to play every day, that's what I've been doing my whole life and doing in the minor leagues."	Miami finished off its second straight sweep, having beaten the New York Mets last weekend.	"The club is gaining a little confidence, but it goes back to our starting pitching giving us a chance," Marlins manager Don Mattingly said.	Marlins starter Trevor Richards struck out six over 5 2/3 innings, allowing eight hits and one run.	Tyler Kinley (1-0) gave up one run in the eighth and got the win. Sergio Romo earned his ninth save with a perfect ninth.	For Detroit, right-hander Matthew Boyd threw six scoreless innings and Miguel Cabrera continued moving up the all-time lists.	Cabrera had an RBI single in the eighth. It was his second hit of the game and moved Cabrera into 60th place on baseball's career hit list with 2,727, one more than Chipper Jones.	With the bases loaded in the sixth inning, Rodriguez hit a flyball to left field. Austin Dean made a sliding catch on the sacrifice fly for a 1-0 lead.	MIGGY MILESTONE	Cabrera went into the game tied with Carlos Beltran for 61st on the hits list.	STREAKY STRETCH	After beating the Chicago Cubs 6-5 on May 6, the Marlins dropped three straight at Wrigley Field to open a seven-game losing streak, which included two-game sweeps against the New York Mets and Tampa Bay. Then, Miami swept the Mets and Tigers, taking three in Detroit by a combined six runs.	"Just as bad as it looks one day, it looks great six days later," Mattingly said. "Stay humble, keep working and just try to ride this as long as we can."

CHICAGO --  Jean Segura and the Philadelphia Phillies think they learned a little more about themselves during a wild four days in Chicago.	They liked what they found out, too.	"We got enough talent here to beat (anybody) in the league," Segura said.	Segura and J.T. Realmuto homered off Jon Lester, and the Phillies beat the Cubs 9-7 on Thursday for a split of the four-game series between division leaders.	Andrew McCutchen added two hits and two RBI as Philadelphia won for the fifth time in seven games. Aaron Nola (5-0) pitched 5 1/3 innings of three-run ball in his second straight victory.	The Phillies won 5-4 in 10 innings in the series opener Monday night. They also held the lead each of the previous two days, only to falter down the stretch. But they managed to hold off the Cubs in the finale behind Hector Neris' adventurous four-out save.	"He had the gutsiest performance possible out there," Philadelphia manager Gabe Kapler said.	After pitcher Tyler Chatwood's pinch-hit double got Chicago within two in the ninth, Neris struck out Addison Russell and retired Victor Caratini on a fly ball to left to close out his eighth save in eight chances. Neris entered with runners on first and second in the eighth and retired Javier Baez on a deep fly ball to left.	"He stayed in there and battled and got the outs that we needed," McCutchen said. "That's all you can ask for from a closer."	Anthony Rizzo and Kyle Schwarber homered for Chicago, which had won three of four. Rizzo finished with four hits and three RBI, but the NL Central-leading Cubs were unable to overcome a second consecutive shaky performance by Lester (3-3).	Realmuto gave Philadelphia a 4-0 lead in the third when he belted a solo drive over the bleachers in left for his seventh homer. The Phillies added three more in the fourth, taking advantage of some shoddy fielding by Chicago.	With Sean Rodriguez aboard after a one-out single, Nola successfully bunted a two-strike pitch from Lester and catcher Willson Contreras threw wildly to first for an error. McCutchen then hit a bouncer up the middle that looked like a possible inning-ending double play, but second baseman Daniel Descalso's throw pulled Rizzo off the bag at first.	Rodriguez scampered home to make it 5-0 Philadelphia. Segura followed with a long drive into the bleachers in left-center for his fifth homer for the NL East leaders.	"We had a couple of mistakes early, but the intensity of our guys is outstanding," Cubs manager Joe Maddon said.	That was the last inning for Lester, who was charged with four earned runs and seven hits in his second straight loss. The ace left-hander has allowed nine earned runs and 17 hits in his last two outings after yielding five earned runs and 35 hits in his first seven starts combined.	Lester was 8-0 with a 1.49 ERA in 10 career starts against the Phillies before Thursday.	"Something just doesn't feel right," Lester said. "The last two starts kind of speak for themselves. We've just got to figure it out."	Segura also doubled in the third to extend his hitting streak to 14 games. The shortstop is batting .325 in his first season with the Phillies.	RESTING	Cubs star Kris Bryant was out of the starting lineup for rest. He walked as a pinch hitter in the sixth.	WORTH NOTING	The Phillies optioned left-hander Cole Irvin to Triple-A Lehigh Valley and recalled right-hander Drew Anderson from their top farm club. Irvin started Wednesday's 8-4 loss and allowed seven runs in 4 2/3 innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: RHP Pedro Strop (left hamstring strain) is scheduled for another bullpen session Saturday. The Cubs haven't decided if Strop will go out on a minor league rehab assignment before returning to the team. "If they ask me, I'm going to say I don't need it," Strop said.	UP NEXT	Phillies: Jerad Eickhoff (2-2, 3.23 ERA) takes the mound Friday night for the opener of a weekend series at Milwaukee. The right-hander allowed five runs in four innings in a 6-1 loss to the Brewers on May 14. Chase Anderson (2-0, 2.66 ERA) pitches for Milwaukee.	Cubs: Kyle Hendricks (4-4, 3.21 ERA) pitches Friday in the opener of a three-game series against Cincinnati. The right-hander is 3-0 with a 1.47 ERA in four May starts. Anthony DeSclafani (2-2, 4.60 ERA) gets the ball for the visiting Reds.	---	Jay Cohen can be reached at https://twitter.com/jcohenap	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Austin Riley has been at the center of Atlanta's recent power surge and did it again with his fifth home run in nine games to set a modern-day franchise record.	Riley's single five innings later was equally pivotal and helped the Braves keep rolling.	Riley hit a game-tying home run in the eighth inning then drove in the go-ahead run in the 13th with a two-out single off Reyes Moronta, lifting the Braves to a 5-4 victory over the San Francisco Giants on Thursday.	"That was a great at-bat," Braves manager Brian Snitker said. "It was a great approach by him. He's been very impressive so far."	Atlanta hit eight home runs in the four games with San Francisco, the most the Braves have hit in one series at the Giants' waterfront ballpark. They hit seven in a four-game series at Oracle Park in 2012.	Riley had three in this series. The 22-year-old became the fastest player in Braves history during the live-ball era to hit his first five home runs.	"That's cool," Riley said. "To be able to do that is an honor. The last hit was even more special to me because it put the team ahead and got the job done."	Riley already had one hit before his two-run homer off Tony Watson with two outs in the eighth.	The Braves had only one baserunner over the next four innings before Dansby Swanson singled against Moronta (1-4) leading off the 13th. After Freddie Freeman flew out, Swanson stole second base. One out later, Riley lashed a single to right field and Swanson scored easily.	Riley and Ozzie Albies both had three hits for Atlanta and Tyler Flowers homered. The Braves have won 10 of 13.	"Mentally he's in a good spot," Flowers said of Riley. "He's into his approach, he trusts himself. He doesn't panic on pitches in, out, up, down. He doesn't let that dictate what he's trying to do."	Luke Jackson (3-1), who blew his fourth save on Tuesday, retired six batters to win. The Braves closer called Riley "a human cheat code" and said the rookie has made a quick impression on his teammates.	"You expect it now," Jackson said.	San Francisco got the tying run on base with one out in the bottom of the 13th but Jackson struck out Mac Williamson before third baseman Josh Donaldson made a barehanded grab on Donovan Solano's short chopper, throwing to first for the final out.	Tyler Austin hit his first career pinch-hit home run, and Brandon Belt scored on a wild pitch for San Francisco.	"We let this one get away," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "We just couldn't get the bats going later on against their bullpen."	Atlanta's win overshadowed a strong outing by Giants starter Madison Bumgarner. The big lefty allowed two runs on six hits, walked two and left with a 4-2 lead. Bumgarner has a 2.12 ERA in nine games against the Braves since his last loss to them on Aug. 25, 2012.	Braves starter Kevin Gausman allowed three runs in six innings. Gausman has one win in his last nine starts.	CONSECUTIVE K'S	Will Smith's swinging strikeout of Charlie Culberson leading off the ninth was the left-handed reliever's 11th consecutive out to come via strikeout, a San Francisco record.	MORE STRIKEOUT CHATTER	Williamson was hit by a pitch in his first at-bat then struck out the next five times he came to the plate. "Maybe I can go talk to Riley a little bit and get his opinion and get some pointers from him," the Giants left fielder said.	WATCH OUT FOR THE BIRDS	Riley got his first look at the seagulls that soar over Oracle Park late in games. "Stuff's coming out of the air and I'm like, `I gotta get out of here," Riley said. "It was a lot of birds. There was a foul ball that almost hit one."	TRAINERS ROOM	Giants: Brandon Crawford was held out of the lineup because of conjunctivitis (pink eye). The three-time Gold Glove shortstop is likely to sit out Friday as well, although Bochy said Crawford is available to pinch hit.	UP NEXT	Braves: RHP Mike Foltynewicz (0-3, 6.91 ERA) will start Friday in St. Louis. Foltynewicz is winless in six outings and has allowed two or more home runs in five of them.	Giants: LHP Drew Pomeranz (1-4, 5.66) faces Arizona on Friday in his second start since coming off the injured list. Pomeranz is winless in nine career games (six starts) against the Diamondbacks.	---	More AP MLB:https://apnews.com/tag/MLBandhttps://twitter.com/AP-Sports	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- C.J. Cron said during spring training he believed that the Minnesota Twins were going to have a good offense this season. Their hitting hasn't just been good, it has been powerful.	The Twins tied a franchise record with eight home runs and beat the Los Angeles Angels 16-7 on Thursday to complete a three-game sweep. The Twins, who also went deep eight times earlier this season at Baltimore, joined the 2005 Texas Rangers as the only teams in MLB history to have multiple games in a season with eight or more home runs.	"It's all just kind of clicked and hopefully there's no stopping," said Cron, who had five hits, including a home run against his former team. "When you are hitting like this it is contagious. If you look at this lineup you are going to see a lot of power. We have the ability to do that and it is nice to show it."	Miguel Sano and Jonathan Schoop went deep twice for Minnesota. Max Kepler, Jorge Polanco and Eddie Rosario also homered.	It was the third time in franchise history, dating to their days as the Washington Senators, that Minnesota homered eight times.	The Twins have an MLB-best 98 home runs through their first 49 games this season, putting them on pace for 324 homers. That would shatter the 2018 New York Yankees' record of 267 home runs.	The 98 homers are tied for the second-most homers through a team's first 50 games in MLB history, according to ESPN Stats & Information research. The 1999 Seattle Mariners had 102 homers in their first 50 games.	"It's pretty amazing. Our guys continue to go up there and not give up at-bats," manager Rocco Baldelli said. "We've had some games this season where we have hit a lot of homers. It's not as if our guys go up there swinging for the fences."	Schoop drove in four runs and Sano three as the Twins won six of seven on a road trip that began in Seattle and wound up with their first sweep in Anaheim since 1996. Minnesota, which leads the American League Central by eight games at 33-16, hit 22 homers against the Mariners and the Angels.	There were a total of 11 home runs in this game, which was originally set for Wednesday but postponed because of unplayable field conditions following a pregame storm.	The eight home runs also tied the Angels' mark for most allowed. It previously happened twice, with the most recent coming in 2005 vs. Texas.	Four of the seven hits Matt Harvey (2-4) allowed in 2⅔ innings went over the wall as the right-hander gave up eight runs for the second time this season. Noe Ramirez and Cody Allen gave up two long balls apiece.	"The long balls were killing us. It's hard, like I've said times, to tell where on the plate it is, but they came out swinging," manager Brad Ausmus said.	Tommy La Stella hit his first grand slam in the ninth for the Angels, who have dropped four straight. David Fletcher and Brian Goodwin also homered for Los Angeles.	Minnesota broke open the game in the second inning with six runs, which included a three-run shot by Schoop and two-run drive by Polanco. Harvey was chased in the third after solo homers by Cron and Sano.	The Twins hit three home runs in the seventh to extend their lead to 14-2. Sano's two-run shot and Schoop's solo homer marked the sixth time the Twins had gone back-to-back this season. Kepler added a two-run drive.	Twins starter Martin Perez (7-1) went five innings and yielded two runs and five hits.	ROAD WARRIORS	Minnesota is 18-8, batting .292 and averaging 6.96 runs on the road, which are all the best in the majors.	The Twins batted .326 (89-for-273) with 37 extra-base hits against the Mariners and Angels while outscoring them 67-27.	"We've played well on the road. We don't get distracted," Baldelli said. "I don't see any difference in how we prepare here compared to home."	TOUGH DAY	Angels right fielder Kole Calhoun came up twice with the bases loaded but was unable to get a hit. He struck out in the third and grounded into a force out to end the fifth.	LATE RELIEF	Angels first baseman Jared Walsh, who made five relief appearances at Triple-A Salt Lake this season, pitched for the first time in the majors. He gave up a run, two hits and a walk in the ninth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Twins: Kepler bruised his right knee when he hit the wall while chasing Goodwin's home run in the ninth inning. Baldelli didn't think it was serious. ... DH Nelson Cruz (left wrist sprain) returned to Minneapolis. He is eligible to come off the injured list Friday, but Baldelli said they are still seeing how he is swinging during batting practice.	Angels: SS Andrelton Simmons (left ankle sprain) saw a foot and ankle specialist Wednesday and expected to remain in a walking boot for at least two weeks. ... LHP Andrew Heaney (elbow) had a bullpen session before Thursday's game and could make his season debut Sunday.	UP NEXT	Twins: Return home and open a three-game series against the Chicago White Sox. RHP Jose Berrios (6-2, 3.39 ERA) has seven or more strikeouts in his past four starts.	Angels: Conclude their homestand with three games against Texas. RHP Griffin Canning (2-3, 3.80 ERA), who became the second Angels starter to go seven innings last Saturday against Kansas City, gets the call on Friday.

CLEVELAND --  As he sprinted madly around the bases, Kevin Kiermaier wondered when he'd stop.	He never did.	Kiermaier legged out a three-run, inside-the-park homer when Cleveland outfielders Oscar Mercado and Leonys Martin collided, and Ryan Yarbrough handled the Indians' struggling lineup into the eighth inning of his first start this season to lead the Tampa Bay Rays to a 7-2 win Thursday night.	With the Rays ahead 3-0 in the sixth, Kiermaier hit a sinking liner to left-center. Mercado and Martin converged on the ball before slamming into each other as they each made an all-out attempt at catching it.	Mercado took the worst of the crash as Martin's left knee drove hard into his right hip. As the two Indians players lay helplessly in the grass, the ball ricocheted toward the left field corner and Kiermaier easily circled the bases for the first inside-the-parker allowed by Cleveland since 2008.	"I never saw the ball -- at all," said Kiermaier, who feared he'd get thrown out. "I was just running to run. At the time, I didn't know what was going on. I was so confused running the bases. I don't know what the heck happened."	Once he rounded third, Kiermaier stopped worrying. But even back in the dugout, he was puzzled.	"I asked my teammates, `Is that a homer? What just happened?" he said.	Tommy Pham, Avisail Garcia and Willy Adames hit solo homers off Adam Plutko (1-1) as the Rays improved baseball's best road record to 16-7.	Yarbrough (3-1), recalled before the game after a stint at Triple-A Durham, allowed two runs and four hits in a career-high 7 1/3 innings. The left-hander began the year in Tampa Bay's bullpen, but struggled and was sent down April 24 to work on his mechanics.	He looked fine-tuned against the Indians, who dropped their fourth straight and nearly lost two more players to injury on a freakish play in the sixth.	The collision between Mercado and Martin sums up the Indians lately. Nothing is going right.	Mercado was down for several minutes before getting to a crouch and finally standing. He did some jogging as manager Terry Francona looked on and remained in the game only to be further tested in the inning as he had to race in to catch a short fly and a line drive.	"It couldn't have been placed any (more) perfectly," Mercado said. "We both went at it full speed and it's just one of those things where it's tough to call, because you don't know if you're going to get to it and it's just, like, a last-minute -- we both reacted and dove. Unfortunately, it resulted in that, but it's a learning experience."	Mercado singled in the sixth before being lifted for a pinch-hitter. Martin jammed his knee, but stayed in.	Kiermaier hoped both Mercado and Martin were OK.	"It's not fun," he said. "After watching the replay, they hit really good. I hit that ball in a perfect spot. Both of them could not make the play, but they ran into each other. As an outfielder, that's never what you want to do."	BANG, BANG, BANG	The Rays didn't waste any time getting to Plutko, as three of Tampa Bay's first six batters homered.	Plutko allowed just one hit -- a homer -- while winning his season debut against Baltimore on May 18. But the right-hander wasn't nearly as effective this time, yielding eight hits in the first four innings and 12 in 5 1/3.	"Clearly, they were better than I was today," Plutko said. "They got to me early. Hung with them for a bit and they delivered the knockout blow there in the sixth. Not my best day."	ALLERGIC REACTION	Rays third baseman Daniel Robertson was replaced in the fifth after suffering an allergic reaction. He has a severe nut allergy and was affected after eating a sweet-potato dish in the clubhouse that contained pecans.	ROAD CREW	The Rays improved to 8-1 in road series openers.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: INF Yandy Diaz won't get to face his former team after being placed on the injured list with a badly bruised left hand. He was hit by a pitch Sunday against the New York Yankees and sat out two games before the Rays decided to give him extended rest. Diaz, batting .256 with nine homers and 22 RBI, was acquired from Cleveland in a three-team trade in December.	Indians: C Roberto Perez sat out his second game in a row with a head injury suffered when he was hit in the mask by a foul ball Tuesday.	UP NEXT	Rays: LHP Blake Snell (3-4, 3.31 ERA) took a no-hitter into the seventh inning of his previous start against Cleveland on Sept. 12. The reigning AL Cy Young Award winner has 30 strikeouts in his last three starts.	Indians: RHP Shane Bieber (3-2, 3.22) fanned 15 in a shutout last week against Baltimore. His outing was just the 15th since 1908 in which a pitcher had 15 strikeouts without a walk.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

HOUSTON --  Lucas Giolito was forced to speed up his pace near the end of his last start for the Chicago White Sox because of rain. The results were so good he decided to try it again Thursday night against the Houston Astros, even though there was no need to rush in the climate-controlled confines of Minute Maid Park.	The tactic certainly paid off.	Giolito pitched a four-hitter for his first major league shutout, rookie Eloy Jimenez hit his third homer in two games and the White Sox beat the Astros 4-0.	"In the last game in the fifth inning, I really picked up the tempo because it started raining," he said. "I was like, why not just try and do that every time? So I was just getting in attack mode early, filling up the zone, and luckily I had my good stuff and we were able to mix sequences really well. It was a good one."	Chicago manager Rick Renteria was asked what superlative he would use to describe Giolito's performance.	"Every one that's in your book that you can put on a page," he said. "If there was 1,000 of them, use all 1,000."	Yoan Moncada had an RBI double and Tim Anderson added a run-scoring single for the White Sox, who earned a four-game series split by handing Houston its first set of consecutive losses since May 1-2.	Giolito (6-1) struck out a season-best nine and walked one in winning his fourth start in a row and fifth straight decision.	"He was doing really anything he wanted to," Houston manager AJ Hinch said. "He was really good, so hats off to him for coming in and throwing all of his pitches for strikes. He's changed his delivery, his arm action a little bit. He came in and really commanded the game from the very beginning."	It was the first nine-inning complete game by a White Sox pitcher since Chris Sale beat Kansas City 7-4 in September 2016, and their first complete-game shutout since Sale threw a two-hitter in a 1-0 win at Tampa Bay on April 15, 2016.	In his previous outing last Saturday, Giolito was credited with his first career complete game when he beat Toronto 4-1 in a game called after 4 1/2 innings because of rain. After that one, the 24-year-old right-hander said he didn't consider it a complete game until he went nine innings.	Didn't take him long to check that box, too.	Giolito threw 82 of his season-high 107 pitches for strikes against a first-place team that began the day leading the majors with an .860 OPS and had homered in 19 consecutive games.	All the hits Giolito allowed were singles. Previously, his longest start was 7 1/3 innings.	"The Astros are a team I always look forward to facing," Giolito said. "A lot of good hitters in that lineup. It's always a fun challenge. They won a World Series a couple of years ago so when you do well against them, it makes you feel pretty good about yourself."	Jimenez, who was 0 for 7 in the first two games of the series before hitting two homers in a win Wednesday night, connected off fellow rookie Corbin Martin (1-1) for a solo shot in the fourth inning that made it 4-0.	Martin gave up six hits and four runs over 3 1/3 innings in his third career start.	Yolmer Sanchez, who had three hits, doubled to start the third before Martin walked Charlie Tilson. Moncada followed with an RBI double to put Chicago up 1-0. A single by Anderson came next to score Tilson. Moncada scored on an error by Martin when his pickoff attempt to first was high.	Missing injured sluggers Jose Altuve and George Springer, the Astros couldn't get anything going on offense. Their streak of 19 straight games with at least one home run was tied for the longest stretch in franchise history.	Michael Brantley hit his second single for Houston with two outs in the sixth. Giolito retired Carlos Correa to end that inning and pitched a perfect seventh before Max Stassi singled to start the eighth. Giolito struck out Jake Marisnick and Josh Reddick before Alex Bregman lined out to end the inning.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: Springer, who has missed the last four games with stiffness in his lower back, took batting practice on the field and will likely return Friday night, Hinch said. ... Altuve (hamstring) continues to make improvement but there still isn't a target date for his return.	TOUGH ON RIGHT-HANDERS	Anderson had two hits and a walk and is batting .344 against right-handers, which leads the AL.	THEY SAID IT	Jimenez on hitting three home runs in two games: "It's been good. It means a lot. It's more fun coming (to the park). It's just the beginning of something good."	UP NEXT	White Sox: RHP Reynaldo Lopez (3-4, 5.14 ERA) starts Friday when Chicago opens a three-game series against the AL Central-leading Twins. Lopez has been strong in his last three starts, posting a 2.29 ERA.	Astros: LHP Wade Miley (4-2, 3.51) is scheduled to start Friday in the opener of a three-game series with Boston. He didn't factor in the decision last time out when he allowed seven hits and three runs -- two earned -- in five innings of a 4-3 loss to the Red Sox.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

CHICAGO --  Steve Cishek missed with his pitch location. Eugenio Suarez didn't miss with his swing.	Suarez hit a two-run homer in the ninth inning off Cishek, one of the Cubs' more reliable relievers, to rally the Cincinnati Reds over Chicago 6-5 on Friday.	Joey Votto drew a leadoff walk from Cishek (1-2) and Suarez hit the next pitch for his 14th home run.	"That was a big hit right there," Suarez said. "I got to enjoy that one.	"Everybody knows (Cishek) is a tough pitcher, with his sidearm (motion), he's got a really good sinker. But at that time, he missed that ball right down the strike zone and I was ready for his fastball."	Cishek said he missed with a sinker as he blew a save for the second time in six chances. It landed deep in Wrigley Field's left-center bleachers.	"I was locked in today," Cishek said. "It was really just a lack of execution. It was a sinker, a two-seamer. It was supposed to be down-and-away. Who knows where it ended up, right into his barrel."	Yasiel Puig hit a two-run homer and an RBI single for the Reds after missing two games with a sprained right shoulder.	Last-place Cincinnati came back twice in this this one to beat the NL Central-leading Cubs for the third time in four games this season.	"It doesn't get much better than that, a lot of things have to go right, guys came through," manager David Bell said. "I think it's right up there in the top couple (wins of the year) for sure."	Anthony Rizzo homered for the third straight game, and Kyle Schwarber and Kris Bryant also went deep to help Chicago take an early 4-0 lead.	Pinch-hitter Willson Contreras singled home Rizzo in the eighth to put Chicago ahead 5-4. Jesse Winker's double off Brad Brach in the Reds seventh tied it at 4.	David Hernandez (1-2) got one out and the win despite giving up Contreras' RBI single.	Raisel Iglesias pitched a perfect ninth for his 11th in 13 chances as the Reds bullpen allowed just one run on three hits in 5 1/3 innings.	"We put a lot on them and they came through," Bell said.	Kyle Hendricks retired the first 10 batters, then allowed three runs on six hits in a six-inning no-decision. After 99 pitches, the right-hander was replaced by Brach to begin the seventh.	Anthony DeSclafani was roughed up for the fourth straight start, yielding four runs on five hits and three walks in 3 2/3 innings.	Schwarber hit his first career leadoff homer, a 449-foot drive bounced on the rear aisle of the right-field bleachers and on to Sheffield Avenue.	After Schwarber walked with two outs in the third, Bryant lifted his 12th homer to right-center. Rizzo followed with his 14th, striking the right field scoreboard for the second time in three games to make it 4-0.	Votto's bloop double to center with one out in the fourth gave Cincinnati its first hit and baserunner. After Hendricks hit Winker with a pitch, Puig lined an RBI single.	Puig's two-run shot off Hendricks to left-center in the sixth closed it to 4-3. The Reds tied it 4-all in seventh off Brach on three straight hits, capped by Winker's double, with two outs.	10K	Amir Garrett entered with one out in the seventh and notched his 10th straight out by strikeout (over four appearances) when he got Schwarber looking. Bryant ended Garrett's string with a comebacker to the 6-foot-5 Reds left-hander to close out the inning.	NICE MONTH	Hendricks was 3-0 in five May starts with a 1.96 ERA. His run started with a four-hit, complete-game shutout of St. Louis on May 3.	LEADOFF MAN	Schwarber batted first for the ninth time this season and 50th time in his career.	ROSTER MOVES	The Reds recalled RHP Matt Bowman from and optioned OF Phillip Ervin to Triple-A Louisville. Bowman entered in the sixth and retired all four hitters he faced.	The Cubs recalled RHP James Norwood and returned RHP Rowan Wick to Triple-A Iowa. Norwood is 1-0 with a 4.95 ERA and three saves with Iowa. Wick was called up on Wednesday and gave up one run in one inning in Chicago's 9-7 loss to Philadelphia on Thursday.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: Puig played right field and batted fifth. He injured his shoulder making a catch and crashing into the wall in Cincinnati on Sunday. ... Bell said INF Scooter Gennett (60-day IL, severe groin strain) took fielding drills and swung bat this week. There's no timetable for his return.	Cubs: RHP Pedro Strop (left hamstring strain) is scheduled for another bullpen session Saturday. Manager Joe Maddon considers Strop's return as key to shoring up the Cubs' inconsistent bullpen. "The (Cubs') biggest weakness -- it's no big secret -- the bullpen, we've had different issues with that," Maddon said. "Getting Stropy back is huge."	UP NEXT	Reds RHP Tyler Mahle (1-5, 3.51) faces Cubs RHP Yu Darvish (2-3, 5.06) on Saturday. Darvish doesn't have a decision in four previous starts, but in his last two has struck out 18 while trimming his walks to three. Mahle got his first win a week ago against the Dodgers after starting the season with five losses.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

WASHINGTON --  The Washington Nationals have endured early season struggles, yet manager Dave Martinez keeps reiterating that his team never gives up.	The Nationals proved their manager right Friday night, battling back from three- and four-run deficits to snap a season-worst five game losing streak with a 12-10 win over the Miami Marlins in a game that included 29 total hits and seven homers.	"I'm proud of these guys for not quitting," Martinez said. "They could've folded early."	Earlier Friday, National GM Mike Rizzo said it was too early in the season to pull the plug on the Nationals plans for the season and that the second-year manager's job was safe.	Juan Soto and Matt Adams hit back-to-back home runs in the eighth inning in what felt like a must-win situation -- even in May	Soto's three-run blast off Marlins reliever Tayron Guerrero was his eighth homer of the season and put the Nationals ahead for the first time at 11-9. Adams provided insurance with his fourth homer of the season, and 100th of his career.	"I fell behind and threw fastball and he put a swing on it," Guerrero said after falling behind 3-1 before Soto's blast.	Soto, who said he saw Guerrero's 99 mph fastball closer to 94 mph, has 15 hits in his last 30 at-bats.	"Every time, every inning we try to fight," Soto said. "We just try to keep going because we know we're good, so we're going to keep going until the last out."	Adam Eaton and Anthony Rendon drew one-out walks off Nick Anderson (1-2) before Soto's homer.	Sean Doolittle gave up a homer to Jorge Alfaro in the ninth before earning his ninth save.	Starlin Castro's two-out, RBI single off Kyle Barraclough (1-1) in the eighth gave Miami a 9-8 lead. But it wasn't enough as the Marlins had their six-game winning streak snapped.	"If you had told me before the game we were going to get 10 runs and lose I would have said `hmm, probably not'," Marlins manager Don Mattingly said. "But it was one of those nights."	Brian Anderson got the offense going early with a two-run homer to left field, his fifth of the season.	Eaton cut the Nationals' deficit in half with his fifth homer in the bottom half of the inning.	Washington tied it in the third on Rendon's two-run homer, his 10th of the season.	Granderson's sixth homer of the season -- a solo shot into the second deck in right field -- put the Marlins back on top, 5-4, in the fourth.	Miami scored three runs in the fifth against Washington reliever Joe Ross, extending the lead to 8-4.	The Nationals entered Friday's game with a MLB bullpen-worst 7.02 ERA.	Washington had four errors in the game, while Miami had one.	TURNER TIMES TWO	Trea Turner had two errors in the third inning. The shortstop was charged with a throwing error to lead off the inning that allowed Brian Anderson to reach first base. Three batters later Turner bobbled a Harold Ramirez grounder. Turner entered Friday with one error in 11 games.	FAST START	Marlins centerfielder Harold Ramirez's RBI double in the fifth inning gave Miami a 6-4 lead. Since making his MLB debut on May 11 against the New York Mets, Ramirez has reached base safely in eight off nine games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: Placed C Chad Wallach (concussion) on the 10-day injured list (retroactive to May 22) and selected catcher Bryan Holaday from Triple-A New Orleans. . RHP Riley Ferrell (right biceps tendinitis) is scheduled to pitch two innings for New Orleans on Saturday. . RHP Julian Fernandez (recovering from Tommy John surgery) will pitch an inning in extended spring training on Saturday.	Nationals: Anibal Sanchez (left hamstring strain) threw a simulated game with 41 pitches on Friday. Nationals manager Dave Martinez said that it went well, and that Sanchez also ran afterward. Martinez wasn't sure if Sanchez would make his next scheduled start; he might want to see him throw a rehab assignment.	UP NEXT	Marlins: Marlins: RHP Sandy Alcantara (2-4, 4.25), coming off his first career shutout in a win against the Mets, makes his third career start against Washington. He's 0-2 with a 10.13 ERA against the Nationals.	Nationals: LHP Patrick Corbin (4-2, 3.25 ERA) is 1-1 with a 4.62 ERA in six career starts against the Marlins.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

PITTSBURGH --  David Freese stepped into the batter's box, heard the polite applause from the crowd at a ballpark he once called home and was surprised when the familiar strains of Tool's "Stinkfist" blasted through the speakers at PNC Park.	The Pittsburgh Pirates played the song as a token of respect for the veteran infielder, who spent two-plus seasons in black-and-gold before being traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers last summer. Freese took in the moment and relaxed. But only briefly. The cheers that greeted him Friday night were quickly replaced by a groan after he turned on a Michael Feliz fastball for a first-inning grand slam that powered the Dodgers to a lopsided 10-2 win.	"They played my walk-up song, maybe that's why I'm pumped," Freese said. "It fired me up."	The Pirates gave Feliz his first major league start in 157 career appearances in an effort to address their injury-riddled starting rotation. The opener strategy backfired for the second time in three days. Feliz (2-1) -- who learned he was getting the ball first when he showed up for work four hours before the first pitch -- recorded just one out and exited after Freese's third career grand slam.	The surprise decision to start Feliz initially threw Los Angeles manager Dave Roberts off balance. He switched his platoon-heavy lineup three times before settling on one he hoped would be effective against the right-handed Feliz and left-handed Steven Brault, who Roberts correctly figured would come in whenever Feliz exited.	That exit came earlier than Pittsburgh anticipated when Freese belted his first grand slam since May 17, 2013, for the St. Louis Cardinals.	"We understood with the opener you get a guy who has pitched a lot," Roberts said. "This was three out of four (days) for Feliz. His pitch count was up in that first inning and for David to stay out over it -- get to a 3-2 count, see a ball up and out over and go to his strength which is right-center field. He put a really good swing on it and obviously right there changed the game."	Staked to a five-run lead before he threw a single pitch, Walker Buehler (5-1) cruised through six innings, allowing one run and five hits. Buehler threw 74 of his 99 pitches for strikes and credited catcher Austin Barnes for calling breaking balls early in counts in an effort to challenge Buehler and keep him mentally sharp.	"I think when you pitch with a lead, sometimes you can get a little careless and just throw fastballs to get ahead," Buehler said. "You've got to tip your cap to (Barnes) for keeping me in there and keeping me engaged. So, it was a tricky deal pitching with a lead like that, but we'll take it every time."	Cody Bellinger, whose 45-game on-base streak ended Wednesday, kick-started another one by hitting a two-run shot in seventh off Geoff Hartlieb for his 18th home run of the season. By then the Dodgers had things well in hand. Bellinger finished 1 for 5, and his major league-leading batting average dipped to .389.	Kevin Newman had an RBI double for Pittsburgh. First baseman Josh Bell, who began the day leading the majors with 47 RBI, went 1 for 4.	OPEN-SHUT CASE?	Injuries to Jameson Taillon and Trevor Williams and the decision not to bring a starter up from the minors led the Pirates to use an opener three times in a week. Montana DuRapau took the first two turns before Feliz got a shot, something Hurdle said "wasn't one of our first thoughts breaking camp because of the depth of our rotation and the things we had in play."	Whether the Pirates will use an opener again is uncertain. A doubleheader in Cincinnati looms on Monday and the team has yet to announce a starter for either game. The results so far have been mixed at best.	"Can some guys do it? Some other people have done it in other places," Hurdle said. "Our two guys here, I think it was something different for him. More opportunities. Maybe they get better. Unfortunately up here everything's magnified when it doesn't work."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: RHP Joe Kelly was placed on the bereavement list, and OF Kyle Garlick was recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma City. Kelly is expected to rejoin the team on Monday. ... RHP Pedro Baez (right leg contusion) went through a pregame workout and could return to action over the weekend after getting hurt against Tampa Bay on Tuesday.	Pirates: LF Corey Dickerson (strained right shoulder) went 0 for 4 with two strikeouts in a rehab start for Triple-A Indianapolis. ... RHP Chris Stratton left after throwing six pitches in the seventh inning. Stratton grimaced after firing a strike to Joc Pederson and motioned for the trainer before exiting with right-side discomfort.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: Hyun-Jin Ryu (6-1, 1.52 ERA) will look for his fifth straight win on Saturday. The 32-year-old left-hander has allowed just four walks in 59 1/3 innings this season.	Pirates: Joe Musgrove (3-4, 3.67 ERA) is winless in two career starts against the Dodgers.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

TORONTO --  When Hunter Renfroe has a chance to give the San Diego Padres a lead, he tends to make the most of the opportunity.	Friday night was no different.	Renfroe hit a tiebreaking, three-run home run in the eighth inning, Greg Garcia and Austin Hedges also went deep, and the Padres beat the Toronto Blue Jays 6-3 for their fourth straight win.	It's the ninth time this season Renfroe has homered to give his team a lead, tying him with teammate Franmil Reyes for second-most in the majors. Only Milwaukee's Christian Yelich (10) has done it more often.	"He loves those situations," manager Andy Green said of Renfroe. "It's been really, really impressive."	Toronto became the first team to start two players with Hall of Fame fathers after calling up Cavan Biggio -- son of Craig -- for his big league debut. Biggio started at second and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was at third.	Renfroe snapped a 3-3 tie by homering on an 0-2 pitch from right-hander Daniel Hudson (3-2). It was his 12th home run of the season, the fifth with two strikes.	"He threw two fastballs right down the middle, and I was a little upset at myself for not swinging at them," Renfroe said. "I was able to get my two-strike approach down and battle and able to hit a ball enough on the barrel to get it out."	Matt Wisler (2-1) got one out for the win and Craig Stammen finished for his second save in six opportunities.	Freddy Galvis hit a two-run homer and Lourdes Gurriel Jr. had a solo shot, but Toronto lost its fourth straight. The Blue Jays are 6-16 in May.	Padres left-hander Joey Lucchesi was perfect through four innings, striking out eight, including six straight.	"I felt locked in," Lucchesi said.	Lucchesi has allowed three earned runs or fewer in four straight starts.	"I would have loved to see him get a win today," Green said. "He pitched really well."	Lucchesi walked Randal Grichuk on four pitches with one out in the fifth, and Galvis followed with a homer that bounced off the top of the wall in left, his seventh. Two pitches later, Gurriel tied it with his first home run of the season. Gurriel was called up along with Biggio.	Biggio went 0 for 3 and struck out twice.	Lucchesi allowed three runs and three hits in 6 2/3 innings. He walked one and struck out a career-high 11.	"He had us off-balance the whole time," Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said.	Blue Jays right-hander Tyler Thornton allowed three runs and four hits in six innings. He walked three and struck out a career-high 10.	"My stuff was probably the best it has been all year," Thornton said. "I made two mistake pitches."	Those mistakes were the two homers Thornton allowed. Hedges opened the scoring with a solo drive in the third, his fifth, and Eric Hosmer made it 2-0 with a two-out RBI single.	Garcia extended the lead to 3-0 with a leadoff blast in the fifth, his second.	The Padres promoted slugging prospect Josh Naylor, who hit 10 homers in 45 games with Triple-A El Paso this season. Naylor is from Mississauga, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto. He went 0 for 4 with two strikeouts.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: OF Alex Dickerson (right wrist) was placed on the 10-day injured list, retroactive to May 20. ... Left-hander Aaron Loup (elbow) was transferred to the 60-day injured list.	JOY OF SIX	Lucchesi is the eighth Padres pitcher to strike out six straight since tracking began in 1974. The last to do it was Andrew Cashner, against Houston on April 29, 2015.	STREAK WATCH	San Diego won a season-high five straight from April 21 to 27.	ROSTER REPORT	Toronto also recalled left LHP Thomas Pannone. The Blue Jays optioned OF Billy McKinney and INF Richard Urena to Triple-A. Left-handed knuckleballer Ryan Feierabend was designated for assignment and right-hander Elvis Luciano was placed on the bereavement list.	UNHAPPY AT HOME	The Blue Jays have lost nine of 11 at home. They're 9-17 overall at Rogers Centre. Toronto entered with an MLB-worst .201 home batting average.	UP NEXT	Padres: RHP Cal Quantrill (0-2, 5.40) makes his fourth big league start in the stadium where his father Paul pitched for the Blue Jays from 1996 to 2001.	Blue Jays: RHP Edwin Jackson (0-1, 6.30) makes his third start for Toronto. He's 1-6 in 16 career games against San Diego.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

NEW YORK --  Winless for almost two weeks, the Detroit Tigers finally busted loose for nine runs and needed every last one of them.	JaCoby Jones homered and had a career-high four RBI , including a go-ahead double in the seventh inning, and Miguel Cabrera also connected as the Tigers halted their nine-game losing streak Friday night with a wild 9-8 victory over the New York Mets.	"We had early work, trying to get all of that other bad stuff out of our system, and they just played. This is the way we know how to play -- we just haven't done it in a few days," said Detroit manager Ron Gardenhire, who spent his major league playing career with the Mets from 1981-85.	"We've had a lot of struggles and it's kind of beat us down a little bit. But like I said, this is the kind of game we've been waiting for."	In a back-and-forth slugfest between two teams swept by lowly Miami within the past week, Detroit blew an early 4-0 lead and then rallied three times from one-run deficits to win for the first time since May 12 at Minnesota.	"We've been grinding, been through tough games, and to have a tough game tonight like that and to come away with a W, that's huge for us," Jones said.	New York hit five home runs at windy Citi Field, including a tiebreaking shot by pinch-hitter Aaron Altherr off winner Buck Farmer (3-3) in his first plate appearance with the Mets.	Amed Rosario, Adeiny Hechavarria, Pete Alonso and Wilson Ramos also went deep for New York.	"It was a crazy game," Altherr said. "A lot of home runs hit, momentum swings."	Cabrera reached base safely four times, delivered a sacrifice fly and went the other way for his 467th home run and second this season. The two-time MVP had gone 81 at-bats without a long ball since April 26 before connecting off an ineffective Noah Syndergaard to tie it 5-all in the fifth.	Jones laced a two-run double with two outs in the seventh against Drew Gagnon (3-1) to put Detroit ahead 8-7. Pinch-hitter Brandon Dixon followed with an RBI single.	Jones, batting eighth, also hit a two-run homer in the second off Syndergaard, who gave up six runs and 10 hits in 5 1/3 innings against an offense that was ranked 29th out of 30 teams in runs.	"I take full responsibility for this loss," he said. "I just didn't get the job done."	It was the most earned runs allowed by Syndergaard since he yielded seven in four innings at San Diego in June 2015. The right-hander has served up 10 homers in 69 1/3 innings this season after permitting only nine in 154 1/3 innings last year.	"I think tonight, he felt like his mechanics were a little off," Mets manager Mickey Callaway said.	Shane Greene got three quick outs for his AL-leading 16th save in 17 chances, bouncing back nicely after giving up a go-ahead grand slam in the ninth inning of a 5-2 loss to the Marlins on Thursday that capped Detroit's 0-9 homestand.	The stretch also included a suspended game against Oakland that the Tigers are losing in the late innings. It will resume in September.	The Mets were coming off a four-game sweep over NL East rival Washington and had won seven straight at home. They have lost seven of eight against Detroit dating to June 2011.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: SS Jordy Mercer (strained right quadriceps) felt fine after running the bases and taking swings during early batting practice. He is expected to begin a rehab assignment at Triple-A Toledo in the next day or two.	Mets: OF Michael Conforto was eligible to come off the seven-day concussion list, but wasn't activated. The team is waiting for Conforto to be cleared by Major League Baseball and hopes that will happen this weekend. Conforto said it appears Sunday is most likely, and he's ready to get right back in the lineup. He took batting practice on the field before the game and has been feeling good after going through baseball activities. Conforto took a concussion test early in the game, administered by Mets doctors, and the results will be passed along to MLB. "It's pretty difficult," he said. "It's really thorough."	MAKING IT LOOK EASY	Detroit got four hits from the No. 9 spot in the lineup. Most stunning were two singles -- one of them a rocket up the middle -- by Tigers rookie pitcher Gregory Soto on 95-plus mph pitches from Syndergaard.	The 24-year-old Soto had never batted in the minors or majors before. He said his last competitive at-bat came when he was 15 and still a position player in the Dominican Republic.	"I was ready for the fastball," Soto said through a translator.	RIGHT OFF THE BAT	Altherr stopped an 0-for-26 slide and became the 12th player to homer in his first at-bat with the Mets. Rajai Davis and Robinson Cano also did it this season.	"Some kind of magic going on around here," Altherr said.	ROSTER MOVE	After the game, Detroit optioned RHP Sandy Baez to Toledo.	UP NEXT	Tigers: LHP Ryan Carpenter (0-2, 13.00 ERA) will be recalled from Triple-A to make his third major league start of the season Saturday afternoon.	Mets: LHP Jason Vargas (1-2, 5.92 ERA) is expected to come off the injured list to make his first big league start since May 5, when he was removed with a strained left hamstring in Milwaukee. Vargas is 4-6 with a 6.38 ERA in 13 career starts against the Tigers.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

CLEVELAND --  Not pretty or polished, but perfect for the Indians.	With their confidence sagging, they had to end a season-high losing streak if it meant battling, scratching or clawing their way to a win.	They did all of that.	Roberto Perez's crawling infield single scored Francisco Lindor with the go-ahead run with two outs in the eighth inning as the Cleveland snapped a four-game losing streak with a 3-1 win over the Tampa Bay Rays on Friday night.	"It was big," said starter Shane Bieber, who matched Cy Young winner Blake Snell for five innings. "It was just a really good game, a really tough game and just to be able to come out on top I think is gonna prove big for us going down the stretch."	With the bases loaded, Perez, who returned to the lineup after missing two games with a concussion, hit a slow roller off Jose Alvarado (0-4) that third baseman Daniel Robertson charged but couldn't field with his bare hand.	Alvarado then walked Jake Bauers to force in Carlos Santana, giving the Indians a 3-1 lead. Alvarado, who replaced Snell in the seventh, walked three in the eighth.	"I thought I was throwing the ball good," Alvarado said. "Sometimes in this game, it's not going to go your way. I thought I threw a good pitch on ball three to Bauers, but I didn't get it. Sometimes, things go your way. Sometimes, they don't."	A.J. Cole (2-1) struck out the side in the eighth and Brad Hand worked the ninth for his 13th save in 13 tries.	Jordan Luplow homered in the fourth off Snell for the Indians, who have been in an offensive funk for months and have been searching for something -- or someone -- to get them going.	Maybe it's Luplow, who's batting .333 (13 of 39) with six homers and 10 RBI against lefties.	In the fourth, Luplow drove a high fastball out of the strike zone from Snell over the wall in right-center.	"I had no business swinging at that pitch, I'm going to be honest," Luplow said. "I was just trying to be aggressive. Because when you get to two strikes with a guy like that, it's going to be a real tough at-bat. Luckily I got a hold of one."	Other than allowing Luplow's homer, Snell had little trouble with the punchless Indians, who came in batting .222.	The left-hander gave up just four hits in 6 2/3 innings. He had issues with his command while walking three, striking out seven and throwing a season-high 104 pitches before manager Kevin Cash gave the ball to Alvarado.	"I was frustrated with a few walks and some outcomes, but for the most part, I thought I did OK," Snell said. "I was upset with how I started and how I finished."	BATTLING BIEBER	Bieber, who fanned 15 in a complete-game shutout against Baltimore on Sunday, worked his way out of one-out, two-on jams in three innings. But he threw too many pitches -- 111.	"They made Bieber work so hard and fortunately for us he was up to it," Francona said. "Every inning, every at-bat, he even said to me, `Man, their at-bats. They didn't chase.' But he also hung in there. I thought he really battled."	LINEUP CHANGE?	Francona has considered moving Lindor out of the leadoff spot to shake up his club's lethargic lineup. He's also spoken to the All-Star about it.	For now, nothing will change.	"He said, `I'll hit wherever you want me to," Francona said. "I think there has to be a reason that makes you better and I don't know if I could say that that would make us better. He's a great player. But then who's leading off?	"We're probably taking maybe the best leadoff hitter in baseball, man that's a pretty good thing to have. We have to find a way to lengthen our lineup. I think it's going to be more with our guys' approach and the guys we have just picking it up a little bit."	WALK ON THE WILD SIDE	Santana has drawn a walk in a career-high 10 games, the majors' longest streak. It's the longest run by a Cleveland player since Victor Martinez walked in 10 straight in 2006.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: 3B Robertson (allergic reaction) didn't start after leaving Thursday's game early. He has a nut allergy and ate sweet potatoes containing pecan. "By the second inning, his color and skin tone changed," manager Kevin Cash said. "We've seen it before, but not like this."	Indians: RHP Mike Clevinger threw a 35-pitch bullpen session and will now head to the team's year-round training complex in Arizona to continue to rehab from an upper back strain. Clevinger's quick recovery has been a huge plus for the Indians, who feared he might be out several more months.	UP NEXT	Rays: RHP Charlie Morton (4-0, 2.65 ERA) has a 17-start unbeaten streak, going 7-0 with a 3.21 ERA since last August 17.	Indians: RHP Carlos Carrasco (4-4, 4.30 ERA) lost both starts against Tampa Bay last season. He leads the AL in strikeout-to-walk ratio (7.33).	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

HOUSTON --  Thrust into an everyday role because of injuries, Jake Marisnick is making the most of his opportunity with the Houston Astros.	Marisnick homered early off Chris Sale, then made two dazzling defensive plays in center field to help the Astros beat the mistake-prone Boston Red Sox 4-3 on Friday night.	"There's not much not to like (about him) in a game like that," manager AJ Hinch said. "When you're a bench player ... you just want an opportunity. You just want a chance to show it. And he's doing great things on the field. It's pretty impressive."	It looks like Marisnick could get more chances for consistent playing time after George Springer injured his left hamstring sliding to try and catch a foul ball in the eighth inning in his first game back after missing four games with a stiff back. Hinch said they'd know more on Saturday, but it looks as if he'll be headed to the injured list.	"I'm not looking forward to the diagnosis, it doesn't look good," Hinch said. "He never pulls himself out of the game like that. He was limping from the very beginning."	In a matchup of the last two World Series winners, the Red Sox committed three errors, not looking nearly as sharp as they did in their last visit to Minute Maid Park when they captured the pennant with a 4-1 win in Game 5 of the AL Championship Series in October. The Astros took two of three last weekend at Fenway Park.	The Red Sox did end Ryan Pressly's MLB-record streak of 40 straight scoreless appearances when Jackie Bradley Jr. launched the first pitch from the Houston reliever for a home run in the eighth inning.	Wade Miley (5-2) yielded four hits and two runs in six innings, striking out a season-high eight to win his fourth straight decision.	All of Boston's errors came in the first four innings to help the Astros build a 4-0 lead.	"You've got to play clean against them," manager Alex Cora said. "They do more than hitting. They run the bases well, they're very athletic. It was a weird one. It was one of those that, if we played better defense, we'd have a chance."	Xander Bogaerts hit a solo homer in the sixth and Bradley made it 4-2.	Christian Vazquez homered off Roberto Osuna with two outs in the ninth, but the Houston closer struck out Bradley for his 13th save. It was his 25th consecutive converted save, a franchise record.	Sale (1-6) gave up three hits and four runs, but only two of them were earned, in six innings. He struck out five after fanning 10 or more in each of his last four starts -- he struck out 10 against the Astros in his previous outing, getting a no-decision in a game Boston eventually won.	Sale was asked about having just one win this season.	"I don't really care whether I'm 6-1, 1-6 or 0-0 for the whole year, I just want to win the games that I pitch in," he said. "Obviously, you want to be on the other end of it and I'm not the biggest fan of coming in here to a quiet clubhouse. It's on me. It's on my shoulders and I've got to find a way to win."	Marisnick robbed Andrew Benintendi of a hit with a diving catch in the fifth. Marisnick got him again for the first out of the ninth when he sprinted to make a nifty, over-the-shoulder catch at the wall.	"Anytime you get a chance to get in there and get consistent reps and see pitching consistently it makes it a little bit easier to make adjustments," Marisnick said. "When you're not playing every day and you're trying to make adjustments and make things work it's hard. So it's been nice to play every day."	Boston's J.D. Martinez also returned to the lineup after missing the previous four games because of a back problem.	The defensive struggles for the Red Sox began in the second inning. Aledmys Diaz singled with one out and reached second on a wild pitch by Sale. He scored when Josh Reddick reached on a throwing error by first baseman Steve Pearce.	Marisnick hit a solo homer in the third. Houston added two runs in the fourth on a wild throw home by shortstop Bogaerts and a sacrifice fly by Springer.	Miley retired the first 10 batters, striking out six. He got Martinez to ground into an inning-ending double play in the fourth with two runners on, and escaped a bases-loaded jam in the fifth by striking out Bradley and retiring Michael Chavis on a lineout.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: INF Brock Holt (shoulder) moved from Triple-A Pawtucket to Double-A Portland on Friday to continue his rehabilitation assignment. Manager Alex Cora said there is a possibility that he could join the team sometime this weekend.	Astros: 2B Jose Altuve (hamstring) continued to ramp up his activity on Friday and Hinch said he is nearing a rehabilitation assignment.	THEY SAID IT	Hinch on taking advantage of Boston's mistakes: "We win a lot of games, but very rarely do we win (where) we get outhit. We just played a cleaner game than they did."	UP NEXT	Red Sox: LHP David Price (2-2, 3.29 ERA) will start for Boston when the series continues on Saturday. Price has a 2.17 ERA with 33 strikeouts in his last five starts.	Astros: RHP Brad Peacock (8-1, 2.24 ERA) is scheduled to start for Houston on Saturday after striking out nine in five scoreless innings against the White Sox for his third straight win in his last start.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

MILWAUKEE --  The Philadelphia Phillies needed a big performance from their bullpen after Jerad Eickhoff struggled.	Vince Velasquez and company delivered.	Five relievers combined for six scoreless innings and Andrew McCutchen hit a tiebreaking double to help Philadelphia beat the Milwaukee Brewers 6-4 on Friday night, overcoming Christian Yelich's major league-leading 20th homer.	"Our bullpen was really good tonight," manager Gabe Kapler said. "As good as they've been all year and through a lineup like this."	Velasquez (2-2), who was reinstated from the injured list earlier in the day, pitched two innings for the win. The usual starter struck out four and walked one.	Velasquez had been sidelined by a right forearm strain.	"I haven't thrown in a while, but it seemed like everything kind of somehow found its groove," he said.	McCutchen's two-hit hit drove in Scott Kingery for a 5-4 lead. Rhys Hoskins added his 12th homer in the seventh, and Hector Neris struck out the side in the ninth for his ninth save in nine tries.	Yelich returned after missing two games with back spasms and went deep in the third. Orlando Arcia also homered, but Milwaukee was hurt by some shaky relief.	Freddy Peralta (2-2) allowed two runs and three hits in two innings. Matt Albers also permitted a run while recording three outs.	Kingery's RBI double made it 2-1 Phillies in the second, but the Brewers tied it in the bottom half on Arcia's fifth homer. After Yelich connected, Yasmani Grandal made it 4-2 with an RBI double off Eickhoff.	Maikel Franco got one back for Philadelphia when he singled in Hoskins in the fourth. Bryce Harper tied it up in the fifth with an RBI double.	Philadelphia had a chance to go in front, but Lorenzo Cain hauled in Cesar Hernandez's shot to deep center as he crashed into the wall.	The Phillies cut down the potential go-ahead run in the fifth when Yelich was thrown out at the plate on a failed double-steal attempt.	"We were trying to steal a run there," Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said. "I'd do it again, frankly."	Neither starter fared well. Milwaukee's Chase Anderson gave up three runs and six hits in four innings, while Eickhoff surrendered four runs and five hits in three innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: RHP Pat Neshek likely will be placed in the injured list after experiencing shoulder pain when throwing earlier on Friday. He has been sent to Philadelphia for further tests, Kapler said. ... RHP Drew Anderson was optioned to Triple-A Lehigh Valley to make room on the roster for Velasquez. ... OF Odubel Herrera fouled a ball off his right shin in the eighth but remained in the game after being checked by a team trainer.	Brewers: C Manny Pina, on the 10-day IL with a right hamstring strain, ran and caught a bullpen session. He could take batting practice on Saturday. ... RHP Jimmy Nelson was reinstated from the injured list and optioned to Triple-A San Antonio. Nelson hasn't appeared in a major league game since having shoulder surgery in September 2017. ... INF Travis Shaw (right wrist strain) continued a rehab assignment at Triple-A San Antonio.	FAST TRACK	Yelich got his 20th homer in his 45th game this season, making him the fastest in team history to reach the mark. Prince Fielder had been the fastest to 20 homers when he reached the number in his 58th game in 2007.	"All those honors are cool, but the focus is always on winning games," Yelich said.	BREWS BROTHERS	Yelich attracted attention at the Raptors-Bucks NBA playoff game Thursday night in Milwaukee when he appeared on the videoboard chugging a beer. Green Bay Packers offensive lineman David Bakhtiari earlier guzzled three beers during a timeout.	"When I saw (Yelich) doing that, I was pretty sure he was going to play today," Counsell said. "He's not in the professional beer-drinking league. I think Bakhtiari might be, at least he should be."	Yelich said he dodged the challenge until the fourth quarter. "I didn't know if I was going to be able to do it," he said.	SEGURA STREAK	Phillies shortstop Jean Segura extended his hitting streak to 15 games.	UP NEXT	Phillies: Jake Arrieta (4-4, 3.77 ERA) pitches on Saturday. He is 8-7 with a 3.38 ERA in 18 career starts against Milwaukee.	Brewers: Jhoulys Chacin (3-5, 4.65 ERA) is 4-1 with a 2.59 ERA in nine career games (seven starts) against Philadelphia.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Though they're not yet one-third of the way through the season, the Minnesota Twins have been putting on quite the show.	These first 50 games were packed with big hits and broken records.	Eddie Rosario went 4 for 5 with three RBI and one of three home runs in another powerful romp by the major league-leading Twins, who beat the Chicago White Sox 11-4 on Friday night for their ninth win in their last 10 games.	Max Kepler was 3 for 4 with four RBI and a homer and Miguel Sano also went deep for the Twins (34-16), who reached double-digit runs for the fourth time in their last eight games and became only the second team in baseball history to reach 100 homers by the 50-game mark. They're at 101. They also have the most runs (300) in the majors, the first team to get there in 50 games since the Toronto Blue Jays in 2003.	"We would never want to put any limitations on ourselves. Our guys, every night, from top to bottom, compete very well," rookie manager Rocco Baldelli said, adding: "We don't get caught up in a lot of the things going on. It's good it's being talked about, because it has been impressive and guys are doing a great job. But in the clubhouse, it's more about how do we do it again the next game."	Jose Berrios (7-2) was the latest beneficiary of the big swings, after falling behind 4-1. Rosario tied the game in the third with his 15th homer. Two batters later, Sano swatted a 2-2 changeup from Reynaldo Lopez (3-5) into the seats for his fifth long ball in seven games this season since coming off the injured list.	"I don't think it really fazes us. We know runs will be scored on this team. That's a given," said Kepler, who has 11 homers. "We kind of just stay in the present within each at-bat and within each pitch and just try to make the most out of it."	By outscoring their opponents 67-29 during a seven-game West Coast road trip, the Twins built an eight-game lead in the American League Central over three-time defending division champion Cleveland. The Indians won Friday to keep pace.	Back home, the Twins played in front of their third-largest crowd of the season (29,683). From the frequent "Ed-die! Ed-die! Ed-die!" chants for Rosario to the loud roars for each long fly ball, the buzz about this surging team has begun to build.	"Everybody's having fun. Everybody's happy when you're hitting a lot of bombas," Rosario said, smiling as he switched from English to Spanish.	HOMER HAPPY	The Seattle Mariners, with 600 home run club members Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez in the lineup in 1999, were the only team in history to reach triple-digit homers in 50 games, with 102, until the Twins joined them. The major league season record was set by the New York Yankees last year with 267.	The Twins have a plus-41 home run differential and a plus-97 run differential, both the best in the majors.	EARLY TROUBLE	Tim Anderson went 3 for 3 and Yonder Alonso drove in two runs for the White Sox, who scored three unearned runs in a four-run second after shortstop Jorge Polanco sidearmed an overthrow to first base off a routine grounder to start the inning. The last three starts by Berrios have been his worst three of 11 turns, with 29 hits and 13 runs allowed over 17 innings, but he retired 14 of his last 19 batters, allowing only five singles.	STRUGGLING STARTERS	Lucas Giolito's four-hit shutout that beat powerhouse Houston on Thursday, his first career complete game, didn't create any momentum for Lopez. The right-hander failed to finish the fourth inning, allowing eight runs for the second time this season and pushing his ERA to 6.03.	Lopez allowed only two earned runs over his last two turns, but Giolito has been a tough solo act to follow. Even factoring in his 6-1 record and 2.77 ERA, White Sox starters entered the game with the second-worst ERA and the second-most walks in the American League.	"It was just a bad day," Lopez said through an interpreter. He added: "They're going to do damage to your mistakes."	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox: Catcher Welington Castillo took a foul ball that broke the top of his helmet in the eighth inning and was removed from the game, but manager Rick Renteria said he was clear of any concussion symptoms.	Twins: DH Nelson Cruz was eligible for reinstatement from the injured list, but the Twins opted for caution with his strained left wrist.	UP NEXT	White Sox: LHP Manny Banuelos (2-3, 7.26 ERA) was slated to come off the injured list and start on Saturday afternoon after the minimum 10-day stay. He was shelved with a strained left shoulder. RHP Thyago Vieira was sent to Triple-A after the game to clear a roster spot.	Twins: RHP Kyle Gibson (4-2, 4.47) will take the mound in the middle game of the series. He's 7-4 with a 2.93 ERA and 84 strikeouts in 92 innings over 14 career starts against the White Sox.	---	More AP MLB coverage: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ST. LOUIS --  A little lineup tweak is working out quite well for Dansby Swanson and the Atlanta Braves.	Swanson homered twice and Freddie Freeman also connected, helping Mike Foltynewicz and Atlanta beat the St. Louis Cardinals 5-2 on Friday night.	The Braves improved to 11-3 since manager Brian Snitker put Swanson in the No. 2 slot ahead of Freeman on May 10.	"I think we help each other a lot," Swanson said. "I would like to think that I help him, especially if I'm on base, that he would be able to get pitched differently. But having him hit behind me is fun."	Swanson drove Miles Mikolas' first pitch of the sixth inning over the wall in left, giving Atlanta a 2-1 lead. Freeman then hit his 13th homer, giving Atlanta its third set of back-to-back homers this season.	"Completely different than last year," Freeman said about Swanson, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2015 amateur draft. "He's staying on pitches a lot longer, seeing balls a lot longer, and putting the barrel on the ball. He's been huge for us."	Swanson and Freeman also hit consecutive homers in the second inning Wednesday night in San Francisco.	Foltynewicz (1-3) allowed an unearned run in six innings in his first win since Sept. 28. The right-hander struck out seven and walked none.	"I think that's the biggest thing right now is confidence, just throwing the ball with conviction," Foltynewicz said. "We kept them off balance just enough the whole night."	Swanson helped put it away with a two-run drive off Giovanny Gallegos in the eighth for his 10th homer. It was his second career multihomer game.	"It's really fun to watch," Snitker said. "He's a confident kid. He's been in the league another year. I sound like a broken record, but it's the truth. He's playing with a lot of confidence and knows he belongs here."	Mikolas (4-5) matched his career high with nine strikeouts in seven innings. He was charged with three runs and seven hits while exceeding his number of losses from all of last season.	"I had a couple games early in the season last year where I gave up four or five runs and we scored eight or nine and a couple tough ones like this," Mikolas said. "That is baseball. Things tend to even out, and I think that's why myself and a lot of the guys around the clubhouse aren't too worried."	Atlanta grabbed the lead when Brian McCann scored on Ronald Acuna Jr.'s double play in the third. St. Louis tied it in the bottom half.	Kolten Wong reached second on rookie Austin Riley's error. Harrison Bader then tripled to center off Acuna's glove, but he was tagged out after being caught in a rundown between third and home when Foltynewicz cut off the throw to the plate.	"That was a huge confidence point right there, just to get him out," Foltynewicz said.  "I could have had a guy on third, no outs, and it could have been a big battle. But we got that guy out there and now we just, with no one on, now we go."	RUN PRODUCER	Cardinals slugger Matt Carpenter got his 500th career RBI when he hit a 442-foot home run to right field off Sean Newcomb in the ninth.	BULLPEN-BOUND	The Cardinals announced struggling right-hander Michael Wacha is going to work out of the bullpen. Wacha is 2-2 with a 6.39 ERA in his last five starts.	Wacha last pitched in relief on Sept. 26, 2016, versus Cincinnati.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Braves: OF Matt Joyce was placed on the bereavement list following the death of his uncle. Snitker says Joyce will miss all three games against St. Louis and return for Tuesday's home game against Washington. RHP Kyle Wright was recalled from Triple-A Gwinnett.	Cardinals: RHP Ryan Helsley was optioned to Triple-A Memphis. OF Lane Thomas remains with the club after being recalled to serve as the team's 26th man for Game 2 of Wednesday's split-doubleheader versus Kansas City.	UP NEXT	Braves RHP Mike Soroka (5-1, 1.01 ERA) faces Cardinals RHP Dakota Hudson (3-3, 4.30 ERA) on Saturday night. Soroka allowed three hits in seven scoreless innings in his only previous outing versus St. Louis on May 15.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

DENVER -- Trevor Story did a little fist pump after his seventh-inning shot. Just a way to commemorate becoming the fastest shortstop to reach 100 homers.	His 101st in the ninth? Now that was celebrated with a lot more gusto.	"I love that one," Story said of his 100th, "but I'll take the ninth-inning one."	Story hit a game-ending drive for his second two-run homer Friday night, helping the Colorado Rockies beat Baltimore 8-6 in the Orioles' first visit to Coors Field since 2004.	Nolan Arenado also went deep twice in the opener of a season-long 10-game homestand. Scott Oberg (2-0) had two strikeouts in a scoreless ninth to earn the win.	Story lined a 2-2 slider from Mychal Givens (0-3) over the wall in right field to ignite the festivities at home plate. It was Story's second career game-ending homer.	With his long ball in the seventh, Story became the quickest shortstop in major league history to reach 100 homers (448 games). He bettered Alex Rodriguez, who reached 100 homers in 470 games.	"It's pretty special to me," Story said.	Trailing 6-3 in the seventh, the Rockies tied it up when Story and Arenado hit back-to-back drives off Shawn Armstrong. Story's homer got the crowd fired up -- and Arenado, too. Arenado belted the next pitch for his second solo homer of the game. He let out an exhilarated roar.	"Trevor got me going," Arenado said. "He can do some things that I wish I could. I wish I could run like him, and I wish I could flip the ball to right-center with power. He does those things that are crazy."	Keon Broxton made an instant impact with a two-run homer on the first pitch he saw in his Baltimore debut. His blast off Jeff Hoffman in the second inning traveled an estimated 474 feet and landed on the left-field concourse.	The Orioles acquired Broxton from the New York Mets on Wednesday for $500,000 in 2019-20 international signing bonus pool allotment. Broxton was designated for assignment last week by the Mets after batting .143 in 34 games with no homers and two RBIs.	"I was actually going to bunt," Broxton said. "Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Arenado back, and then a couple of seconds before the pitch came, I saw him creeping up; I thought, 'I'm swinging right here.'"	Dwight Smith Jr. and pinch hitter Renato Nunez also homered for Baltimore.	Baltimore's bullpen allowed five runs after a solid start by John Means.	"It's concerning," manager Brandon Hyde said. "It's a little bit of a rough patch for our bullpen."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rockies: OF Charlie Blackmon remains day-to-day with a tender right calf. "He's feeling better but is still sore," manager Bud Black said.	GRADUATION TIME	The Orioles will be missing a few coaches this weekend while they attend graduation ceremonies for their children. Pitching coach Doug Brocail was scheduled to miss Friday, while bullpen coach John Wasdin is expected to miss the weekend series.	HOMECOMING	Rookie infielder Brendan Rodgers played his first game at Coors after making his major league debut on the road.

Rodgers had about 22 family members and friends at the park. He had two hits, including a run-scoring single, and made a catch along the right-field railing before flipping into the stands.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  With six home runs in his last nine games, Mark Canha is trying to do his best impression of Oakland teammate Khris Davis. That's going to be critical in the coming weeks while Davis continues to recover from a sore left hip.	Canha went deep for the third consecutive game as part of back-to-back home runs with Matt Olson in the fourth inning, and the Athletics beat the slumping Seattle Mariners 6-2 on Friday night for their seventh straight win.	Davis, the majors' home run leader in 2018, was placed on the 10-day injured list with a left hip/oblique contusion before the game.	"If you're looking for a replacement for Khris, that's the guy," A's manager Bob Melvin said of Canha. "He feels good at the plate, he's getting good swings, seeing some pitches, taking some walks. Really good."	Stephen Piscotty also homered and singled twice to extend his on-base streak to 22 games, the longest active streak in the majors. Ramon Laureano added two hits.	Lou Trivino, the fourth of five pitchers used by the A's, retired four batters to win after starter Daniel Mengden matched his career high with five walks.	Oakland, which had a game Sunday in Detroit suspended in the seventh inning due to weather, beat the Mariners for the first time this season after losing twice in Tokyo and twice in Seattle.	"We're riding a high right now," Canha said. "When that happens you have to ride the wave, and we're doing a good job of that."	The A's combined to issue seven walks but only one of the free passes was costly. The Mariners left the bases loaded three times and stranded 15 runners overall.	"We did exactly what we wanted do against Mengden but we couldn't get the big hit," Mariners manager Scott Servais said "A lot of really good things offensively but you have to get hits with runners in scoring position and that's the name of the game."	Domingo Santana had three hits and an RBI for Seattle, which has lost four straight and seven of eight.	Olson hit his fifth home run with two outs in the fourth, a three-run drive to right-center field. Canha followed with his eighth homer two pitches later. Canha has homered in three straight games for the first time in his career.	"I guess you could say it's timely," Canha said. "It's good that I'm like filling his shoes, trying to be Khris Davis now. This is my best version of it. It always helps when somebody gets on a hot streak."	Both home runs came against Wade LeBlanc (2-2), who allowed four runs and five hits in five innings.	"They caught a couple of mistakes and those didn't come back," LeBlanc said. "I have to make better pitches. Two mistakes left the yard."	The A's scored an unearned run in the seventh on Seattle catcher Omar Narvaez's throwing error. Piscotty homered off Connor Sadzeck in the eighth.	Mengden allowed one run and five hits. He threw 99 pitches in four innings.	ROSTER MOVE	The A's recalled outfielder Skye Bolt from Triple-A Las Vegas.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: Sadzeck was removed for unknown reasons after getting checked on by the team trainer in the eighth. ... 3B Kyle Seager is set to come off the 60-day disabled list and is expected to start on Saturday. Seager underwent surgery to repair a tendon in his left hand he injured while diving for a ball in spring training.	Athletics: Davis as injured May 5 chasing a foul ball in Pittsburgh when he ran into the railing near left field at PNC Park and has been in and out of the lineup since.	UP NEXT	Mariners LHP Yusei Kikuchi (3-1, 3.43 ERA) faces Oakland for the third time in a third different stadium this season. Kikuchi previously pitched against the A's in Tokyo and Seattle, taking a no-decision each time. RHP Mike Fiers (3-3, 5.05) pitches for Oakland and has two wins in 10 career starts against the Mariners.	---	More AP MLB:https://apnews.com/MLB andhttps://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Drew Smyly has had a long road back from Tommy John elbow surgery, and the Texas left-hander put together a quality start on Friday night that helped earn him his first win in three years.	Smyly went a season-best six innings and kept the Los Angeles Angels offense in check long enough for the Rangers to rally for a 4-3 victory.	"I know it has been a real long time with the surgeries and two years off but it feels like the monkey is off my back and I can move forward," said Smyly, who got his first win since Sept. 13, 2016 -- 32 months -- when he was with Tampa Bay.	Smyly (1-3), who allowed three runs on five hits, missed the last two seasons after injuring his elbow in spring training while with Seattle in 2017. He underwent Tommy John surgery in July 2017 and spent last season rehabbing while with the Chicago Cubs.	Hunter Pence had two hits and drove in two runs for the Rangers, who have won eight of nine to move two games over .500 for the first time since April 23. Shin Soo-Choo also had two hits and led off the game with a home run to center.	Smyly allowed all three of his runs in the second on home runs by Jonathan Lucroy and Brian Goodwin. The Angels looked as if they were going to add to their 3-1 lead in the fifth when David Fletcher's single and Mike Trout's ground-rule double put runners on second and third with no outs, but Smyly retired the next three hitters, including striking out Albert Pujols.	"I really wanted to get him the win today. He's been battling a lot of things and fought through it. He kept us in the game," Rangers manager Chris Woodward said. "I told him after the sixth that we were going to get him a win and it worked out."	The Angels committed two errors in the seventh that led to the go-ahead run. Choo led off the inning by reaching on an error by shortstop Zack Cozart and advanced to second when Logan Forsythe walked. After the runners advanced on a ground ball, they scored on Pence's line-drive single to center off Cam Bedrosian (1-3) that Trout misplayed, allowing Pence to advance to second. It was Trout's first error since 2017.	"We just got a little sloppy defensively, and it hurt us," Angels manager Brad Ausmus said. "I think Mike was caught in between diving and not diving and the ball took a hop. We don't see errors like that a lot from him, but it just happened to come at a tough time."	Trout had a chance to tie it with Goodwin on second and two outs in the ninth, but Shawn Kelley struck him out to get his fifth save.	Griffin Canning allowed one run and three hits in six innings for the Angels, who have dropped their last five and are six games under .500. The right-hander has allowed only one run and six hits over 11 innings in his last two starts.	The Angels' bullpen lost their third straight game when it has been tied or they have inherited the lead. They have allowed 12 runs -- 11 earned -- and 15 hits in 10 innings during that span.	After Choo put the fifth pitch of the game over the wall in center field for his eighth homer of the season, Los Angeles countered with three runs in the second.	Lucroy led off the inning with a solo shot to center for his seventh to tie it at 1. Tommy La Stella singled and scored three batters later when Goodwin sent Smyly's fastball down the right-field line for a two-run shot. It was Goodwin's sixth homer of the season, with three coming against Texas.	Asdrubal Cabrera's double in the sixth scored Pence to bring the Rangers within 3-2.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: SS Elvis Andrus (hamstring) is with the team and remains on track to be activated Saturday, which is the first day he is eligible to come off the injured list. OF Delino DeShields was optioned to Triple-A Nashville after the game.	Angels: LHP Andrew Heaney (elbow) will get his first start of the season in Sunday's series finale after his bullpen session went well Thursday. ... OF Justin Upton (turf toe) has been cleared to take batting practice and is fielding ground balls.	UP NEXT	Rangers: LHP Mike Minor (5-3, 2.64 ERA) is sixth in AL in ERA, seventh in innings pitched (64 2/3) and tied for eighth in strikeouts (67).	Angels: LHP Tyler Skaggs (4-4, 5.01 ERA) has won his last three starts against the Rangers and has allowed only two earned runs in 17 1/3 innings.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

SAN FRANCISCO -- The Arizona Diamondbacks took out a week of frustrations on San Francisco's pitching staff.	Ildemaro Vargas had five hits and a home run, Adam Jones added four hits and a homer, and the Diamondbacks broke out of a slump in a big way, beating the Giants 18-2 on Friday night in the highest-scoring game in 20 seasons at San Francisco's waterfront ballpark.	"We needed it," said bench coach Jerry Narron, who filled in for manager Torey Lovullo. "Everybody knew we were going to break out at some point and someone would pay for it. Tonight was the night. Hopefully everybody can relax a little bit and swing the bat more aggressively."	Arizona had been held to 12 runs during a five-game losing streak before unleashing its bats on Drew Pomeranz (1-5) and an overmatched Giants bullpen.	Robbie Ray (4-1) was the beneficiary of the big offensive night, giving up two runs in 5 1/3 innings to win his fourth straight decision. Ray even got into the act on the offensive side with a two-run single in the third inning for his first hit of the year. He retired 13 in a row at one point with eight strikeouts in that span.	"That was me at my best today," Ray said.	Ray had plenty of help. Vargas homered in the first inning, and the Diamondbacks turned it into a laugher against reliever Nick Vincent with three-run homers by Jones in the fifth and Eduardo Escobar in the sixth inning.	Ketel Marte added a three-run homer off Derek Holland in the seventh, prompting cheers of "Let Pablo Pitch!" from the few fans remaining who were hoping that Giants infielder Pablo Sandoval could get his second appearance on the mound this season. But manager Bruce Bochy didn't oblige because he plans to start Sandoval at third base Saturday and didn't want him to have a sore arm.	Every member of the Diamondbacks' starting lineup either scored or drove in a run in Arizona's highest-scoring game of the season following a team meeting in San Diego after the latest loss Wednesday and a day off.	"It grinds on you," catcher Carson Kelly said. "When that happens, you want to be the guy to do too much. We just said, 'You know what, let's slow things down. We know we're a good team. Let's pick each other up.'"	Tyler Austin hit a two-run homer in the first inning for San Francisco, his third straight game with a home run. The Giants managed nothing else against Ray and fell to 1-4 on the homestand.	"Occasionally, you're going to have a game like this," Bochy said. "Trust me, they're not fun, especially at home. Started out rough, gradually got worse."	Zack Godley pitched three innings for his second save.	Pomeranz had another rough outing against an NL West opponent, giving up the solo homer to Vargas in the first, RBI singles to Marte and Vargas in the second, and then the two-run single to Ray in the third that ended his night. Pomeranz gave up five runs and eight hits in 2 2/3 innings, falling to 4-18 with a 5.34 ERA in his career against NL West teams.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: LF David Peralta was put on the injured list because of an injured right shoulder. 1B Kevin Cron and OF Tim Locastro were called up from Triple-A Reno. Arizona had an open spot on the 25-man roster after sending pitcher Jimmie Sherfy to the minors.	Giants: SS Brandon Crawford missed his second straight game because of pink eye. ... C Buster Posey was held out of the lineup a day after catching 13 innings.	BALL MAGNET	Locastro was hit by pitches three times in the game. Pomeranz hit him in the third inning, Vincent in the sixth and Holland in the seventh. Locastro has been hit seven times this season in only 29 plate appearances.	FILLING IN	Lovullo missed the game to attend the high school graduation of his youngest son, Connor. Narron filled in as manager, and Luis Urueta took over as bench coach. Lovullo is expected back Saturday.	UP NEXT	The Diamondbacks will call up RHP Taylor Clarke (0-1) from Reno to start Saturday's game against Andrew Suarez (0-1). Arizona will need to make a roster move before the game to make room for Clarke.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Kyle Gibson knew he didn't have to do too much to give his slugging teammates a chance to win on Saturday, but the Minnesota Twins starting pitcher went out and threw a gem anyway.	Gibson pitched seven strong innings, C.J. Cron and Ehire Adrianza each drove in four runs and the Twins beat the Chicago White Sox 8-1 for their 10th win in 11 games.	Gibson (5-2) gave up five hits and walked none while striking out nine. Only four White Sox batters reached second base on the day, and he retired 10 of the last 11 batters he faced.	The veteran right-hander said with the Twins' offense leading the majors in runs and homers, the starting pitchers know they can be the key to making this a special season in Minneapolis.	"Rarely are we going to have three or four games in a row where we only score one or two runs," Gibson said. "So it's going to be up to the starting pitching to be consistent."	His only blemish was Jose Abreu's leadoff homer in the fourth inning, but the Twins immediately tacked on three more runs in the bottom half of the inning. Cron drove in two runs with a single and Adrianza drove him home with a base hit to hand Gibson a 5-1 lead.	"That always makes a big difference, and that's what really creates that feel in the locker room," Gibson said. "When we show up knowing there's going to be six or seven runs on the board, it gives everybody confidence."	Adrianza capped the scoring with a three-run homer to right in the eighth inning. It was Minnesota's 102nd home run of the season, tops in the major leagues.	BLOWN FLY BALL	White Sox starter Manny Banuelos (2-4) was back after missing his last turn in the rotation with a sore shoulder. He got into trouble quickly by walking two straight batters with two outs in the first, and was then hurt by a costly defensive miscue.	Cron hit a high, short fly ball on a 3-0 pitch, but the ball drifted on right fielder Charlie Tilson, who staggered under it until it fell just out of his reach in the alley. The gift double gave Cron two RBI and the Twins a 2-0 lead.	"I don't intend to make an excuse," Tilson said. "I've got to make that play. You know going into the game the ball is moving a lot and as outfielders, we know we've got to keep our feet moving. Unfortunately, I just got caught in a bad position and couldn't make up."	Banuelos wasn't blaming his defense.	"I know the wind was crazy today. I understand that," Banuelos said. "There's some games where they make great plays for us. There's sometimes when that happens."	BUZZ IS GROWING	With the weather warming up in Minnesota and the Twins holding the best record in the major leagues, their fans are showing some appreciation. After a 6-1 road trip last week, the Twins have drawn some of their best crowds of the season for the first two games of the series. Saturday's attendance of 39,139 was the first sellout since opening day, and the players noticed it.	"It's been fun the last couple of nights for sure," Cron said. "It seems when we do something well they get excited, they cheer for us and we definitely feel it as players.  We have a good ballclub. I think there's reason for them to come out, I think we definitely feed off that.	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox: SS Tim Anderson was a late scratch with a sore right wrist. He was hit there while swinging at a pitch on Friday night. C Wellington Castillo was placed in the 7-day concussion protocol after he took a foul tip off the mask in Friday night's game. The team called up C Seby Zavala from Triple-A Charlotte to replace him.	Twins: Though DH Nelson Cruz (wrist) is eligible to return from the 10-day DL, the Twins have decided to give him more time before activating him.	UP NEXT	White Sox: RHP Dylan Covey (0-3, 5.31 ERA) is scheduled to face the Twins Sunday in the series finale. Covey, who made his major league debut at Target Field in a win over the Twins two years ago, is 0-2 with a 5.30 ERA in four appearances against Minnesota.	Twins: RHP Jake Odorizzi (6-2, 2.38) had won six consecutive starts before taking a no-decision last Monday at Anaheim. He gave up three hits and two walks over five scoreless innings in a game the Twins won 3-1.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Luke Voit put on quite a power show for his big rooting section at Kauffman Stadium.	With 60 family members and friends in the stands, the Missouri native hit a 470-foot, go-ahead home run in the seventh inning that sent the New York Yankees past the Kansas City Royals 7-3 Saturday in the first game of a split doubleheader.	Voit grew up near St. Louis, was drafted by the Royals out of high school, went to Missouri State and made his major league debut with the Cardinals.	"To hit the farthest home run I've probably ever hit in front of them is pretty surreal," Voit said.	Voit's two-run drive helped the Yankees win their sixth in a row.	Friday night's game was postponed because of severe thunderstorms, forcing the split twinbill.	J.A. Happ (4-3) threw six strong innings, striking out 10. He allowed only a single hit until a familiar problem showed up in the sixth when Whit Merrifield hit a tying, three-run homer. It was the 14th homer Happ has allowed, tied for second most in the majors.	But unlike past home runs, Happ threw a good pitch, and Merrifield simply put a good swing on the ball.	"You tip your cap. He hit a ball at his shoulders," Happ said.	But Yankees manager Aaron Boone won't let one swing take away from Happ's effort.	"It was a dominating effort," he said. "He had swings and misses all day on the fastball. I thought he was just locked in from a focus standpoint, getting the ball and executing pitches all day long."	Voit quickly restored the Yankees' lead when he connected off Scott Barlow (1-1). Voit also singled and scored in the first inning, scoring from first base on Clint Frazier's two-run double.	"It doesn't matter if I'm hitting, Gary (Sanchez), Gleyber (Torres), whoever. Everybody calls us the Baby Bombers, so I feel like someone will hit a home run or get a big hit," Voit said.	Thairo Estrada added some insurance in the eighth with a double into the right field corner that scored Brett Gardner and Frazier. Gardner had three hits and scored twice.	Adam Ottavino and Luis Cessa combined to throw three scoreless innings in relief of Happ.	After Billy Hamilton reached on an infield single and Nicky Lopez singled, Merrifield connected for his seventh home run of the season. Merrifield didn't hit his seventh homer last year until Aug. 5.	"Whit's put himself in a position to be a run producer," Royals manager Ned Yost said.	Barlow had his second straight shaky outing for the Royals. His ERA sat at 2.01 after a scoreless outing against the Los Angeles Angels on Sunday, but got tagged for four runs in 1 2/3 innings on Wednesday in St. Louis and gave up four more runs Saturday in 1 1/3 innings.	"We gave up six runs on three hanging sliders today and Barlow threw two of them," Yost said.	Jakob Junis threw six innings, giving up six hits, three runs and striking out seven, giving up little else after the two-run first.	"Good thing I settled in after that," Junis said. "It could've been a long day, but settled in, locked in. Me and (Martin Maldonado) had a good game plan and we executed for the remainder of the game."	Lopez had a couple of hits in his first game as the Royals' leadoff hitter and Adalberto Mondesi stole his major league-best 18th base.	CONSECUTIVE TWINBILLS	The Royals were back in action for the first time since playing a doubleheader against St. Louis on Wednesday, which also was caused by stormy weather. Kansas City is playing consecutive doubleheaders for just the eighth time in franchise history, and first time since August 13-14, 1983. It's just the second time Kansas City has played consecutive doubleheaders against two different opponents, the other time occurring on April 19 and 22, 1972, against Oakland and the Chicago White Sox.	ROSTER MOVES	Royals: Kansas City recalled LHP Brian Flynn from Triple-A Omaha and optioned RHP Richard Lovelady. Lovelady remained with the team as the 26th player for the second game of Saturday's doubleheader. Flynn hasn't pitched yet this season after spraining the UCL in his throwing arm late in spring training. The 29-year-old lefty appeared in six games for Omaha, allowing 10 runs in 22 2/3 innings pitched. He had a 2-2 record with a 3.57 ERA.	Yankees: Chance Adams was recalled Saturday to serve as New York's 26th player in Game 2 of the doubleheader. Adams threw three scoreless innings in a 13-5 win over Tampa Bay on May 19, his only appearance this season.	UP NEXT	The Royals and Yankees will play Game 2 of their doubleheader Saturday night with a first pitch scheduled for 7:15 p.m. Jorge Lopez (0-5) will start for Kansas City and Chad Green (0-2) will be the opener for the Yankees.	---	More AP MLB:https://apnews.com/tag/MLB andhttps://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

CHICAGO --  Addison Russell delivered an impressive all-around performance on a wild day.	The Chicago Cubs needed every last bit of it, too.	Russell homered at Wrigley Field for the first time since he was suspended for violating baseball's domestic violence policy, leading Chicago to an 8-6 victory over the Cincinnati Reds.	With the wind blowing out on a warm afternoon at the iconic neighborhood ballpark, Albert Almora Jr. and Jason Heyward also connected to help the NL Central-leading Cubs rebound from a disappointing loss in the series opener Friday.	Russell finished with three hits and scored twice. The second baseman also made a nice stab and tag to retire Jose Iglesias when he attempted to steal second in the eighth.	"I'm getting there," Russell said. "It's still a process right now. I think whenever the right time is here, I'm gonna be able to bloom."	Russell was optioned to Triple-A Iowa after completing his suspension this month, but he was recalled May 8 and hit his first homer of the season May 15 at Cincinnati.	He hit a two-run homer in the fourth inning Saturday, giving the Cubs a 3-2 lead. He also had a timely bunt single and scored a big insurance run in the eighth.	Tucker Barnhart hit a two-run homer for the last-place Reds, who finished with 14 hits. Yasiel Puig and Derek Dietrich also went deep.	"I think it was a hitter's day today," Reds manager David Bell said. "You don't really try to change your approach too much, but it seemed like any ball that got up into the air had a chance to get out."	Dietrich's 13th homer tied it in the eighth. But the Cubs went ahead to stay on David Bote's RBI double against Jared Hughes (2-2) in the bottom half, and Kyle Schwarber added a sacrifice fly.	Dillon Maples (1-0) got two outs for the win after he was recalled from the minors before the game. Tyler Chatwood gave Chicago's weary bullpen a lift by working the ninth for his first save since 2017.	The Cubs also got some important length from Yu Darvish, who allowed six runs and 12 hits in seven-plus innings. Manager Joe Maddon was concerned about the bullpen coming into the day, and Darvish pitched past the sixth for the first time this season.	Cincinnati had a chance for another late rally after Eugenio Suarez hit a two-run homer in the ninth in Friday's 6-5 victory.	The Reds scored twice in the fifth to trim the Cubs' lead to 5-4. Suarez had an RBI single and Puig belted a long solo shot over the left-field bleachers.	After Heyward led off the fifth with a drive into the basket in left-center, Reds rookie Nick Senzel hit a two-out RBI single in the sixth to make it a one-run game again.	Cincinnati put its first two batters on in the ninth, but Chatwood got Jesse Winker to bounce into a 3-6-1 double play and Puig flied out to right to end the game. It was Chatwood's third career save, continuing a nice comeback season for the right-hander.	STRETCHING OUT	After striking out Puig to end the seventh, Darvish had 100 pitches and appeared finished. But Maddon let the right-hander go back out for the eighth.	"He had his quickest inning the inning before," Maddon said. "I think it was a six-pitch inning and I thought he looked really sharp. With the shorter bullpen, I thought, `Let's give it a roll."	Although it didn't work out, Darvish was pleased and considered the performance a positive.	"After the (eighth), I was frustrated, but the team won, so I'm so happy right now," he said.	ROSTER MOVES	The Cubs recalled left-hander Tim Collins and Maples from Triple-A Iowa to bolster their bullpen. Right-hander James Norwood and outfielder Mark Zagunis were optioned to Iowa following Friday's game.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: RHP Pedro Strop (strained left hamstring) was scheduled to throw a bullpen on Saturday, followed by another session on Monday or Tuesday. "He's getting very close," Maddon said. "Hopefully by the end of next week ... whether he's gonna go out (on rehab assignment), we should know by then."	UP NEXT	Reds righty Tanner Roark (3-3, 3.51 ERA) faces lefty Jose Quintana (4-3, 3.30 ERA) Sunday in the finale of the three-game series. Roark, who is from nearby Wilmington, Illinois, is 4-1 with a 3.03 ERA in six games at Wrigley Field. Quintana allowed three runs in five innings at Cincinnati on May 16.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

TORONTO -- Austin Hedges connected for a grand slam and the San Diego Padres hit a franchise-record seven home runs to romp past the Toronto Blue Jays 19-4 Saturday for their fifth consecutive victory.	Wil Myers and Hunter Renfroe each hit two home runs and Ian Kinsler and Eric Hosmer also homered. The previous team record was six, set at Cincinnati on July 17, 1998.	Hedges hit his first career slam and drove in five runs. Myers went 2-for-2, drove in four and scored four times, and Renfroe had four hits, scored four and drove in three.	Myers hit the team-record seventh homer in a five-run eighth that included homers by Hosmer and Renfroe off Sam Gaviglio.	The Padres nearly matched the franchise record of 20 runs, done twice and most recently at Montreal in 2001.	San Diego put two on with two out in the ninth against Luke Maile, a catcher who pitched the final inning. Hedges, the San Diego catcher, took three strikes to end the inning. Maile began the inning by getting Renfroe to look at strike three.	Rookie Cal Quantrill (1-2), from nearby Port Hope, Ontario, and the son of former Blue Jays and Padres pitcher Paul Quantrill, went six innings to earn his first major league win in his fourth career start.	The 24-year-old right-hander struck out a career-high nine, while surrendering three earned runs on homers by Lourdes Gurriel Jr. and Justin Smoak, the only hits Quantrill allowed.	Myers and Kinsler hit back-to-back home runs in the second. Hedges launched San Diego's first slam of the season in the fourth.	Rookie Josh Naylor, from nearby Mississauga, Ontario, had given the Padres a first-inning lead with his first big league hit in his second career game, an RBI double. Naylor and Hosmer each had three of the Padres' 20 hits.	In his third start of the year, Edwin Jackson was roughed up for the second straight game. After surrendering six runs over five innings to Boston on Monday, the right-hander lasted just four innings, giving up seven earned runs on seven hits.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: OF Franmil Reyes, San Diego's leading home run-hitter with 15, was given the day off Saturday to rest his knees. He tore his meniscus back in November in the Dominican Winter League and manager Andy Green opted to play it safe on the artificial turf of Rogers Centre. Naylor replaced him in right field.	UP NEXT	Padres rookie RHP Chris Paddack (4-2, 1.93) faces Blue Jays RHP Marcus Stroman (2-6, 2.81) on Sunday. Paddack makes his second interleague start, having picked up the win April 24 against Seattle. Stroman makes just his second start against San Diego, taking a no-decision after 6⅔ innings in July 2016.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Ildemaro Vargas was adamant that he scored before the Giants completed an inning-ending double play in the first, quickly calling for Arizona manager Tory Lovullo to ask for a replay.	Vargas' headfirst dive into home plate in the third wasn't nearly as close and highlighted another big day by the Diamondbacks offense.	Ketel Marte homered for the second consecutive day, Adam Jones had two hits and an RBI, and Arizona beat San Francisco 10-4 on Saturday.	"You put up runs like that in this ballpark that's fairly challenging offensively, you're doing some things right," Lovullo said. "It was just one thing after another. We built some innings and we executed, we swung at good pitches. Those are the ingredients that we're looking for."	The Diamondbacks' second straight lopsided win over the Giants got rolling early when Arizona benefited from an overturned call in the first after San Francisco right fielder Kevin Pillar made a spectacular diving catch to rob Kevin Cron of a one-out hit.	Pillar got up and threw to first base to double up Jones just as Vargas scored. Umpire Mark Ripperger initially ruled that the third out was made before Vargas crossed home but Vargas believed otherwise.	"I was running hard and I was checking," Vargas said through a translator. "I knew when I stepped (on the plate). I looked again, and I knew it was before the ball got to first."	Lovullo asked for a review and the call was changed. And while it ultimately wasn't a pivotal play, it was big at the time.	"There was a lot of craziness and I didn't really get a lot of the necessary information. But I was looking at Vargas and he told me that he beat the throw," Lovullo said. "Instinctually I know that the players see things a little bit crisper than everybody else. I trusted what he said and went ahead and challenged it."	Vargas drove in two runs and scored twice for Arizona -- the second coming in the third when he scored from first on Eduardo Escobar's RBI double. Cron added a double and two RBI in his major league debut.	The Diamondbacks have outscored the Giants 28-6 in the first two games of this series.	One day after setting a season-high with 21 hits, Arizona had another big day at the plate with 13 hits. Every starter except pitcher Taylor Clarke had at least one, and six players drove in runs.	"It's fun to watch," Clarke said. "Between yesterday and today, the runs they keep piling up, it makes it a little bit easier to pitch. You have a little more comfort room. Just go out there and attack hitters the way you want to."	Clarke (1-1) pitched into the seventh and allowed three runs for his first career win. The right-hander struck out four and walked three in his second career start after being called up from Triple-A Reno before the game.	Pablo Sandoval singled in a pair of runs for San Francisco. Mike Yastrzemski, the grandson of Hall of Famer Carl Yastrzemski, went 0-for-3 with two strikeouts and scored a run in his major league debut with the Giants.	"It's something you dream about your whole life," Yastrzemski said. "It was surreal and awesome."	Marte tripled and scored leading off the game before homering off starter Andrew Suarez (0-2) leading off the third.	Leading 6-1, the Diamondbacks scored four in the fifth to pull away. Cron and Tim Locastro had RBI-doubles and two more scored when Alex Avila's sharp grounder rolled under the glove of first baseman Brandon Belt for an error.	The Diamondbacks made their own defensive gem in the sixth. Right fielder Blake Swihart bobbled Pillar's double but made a strong throw to third baseman Eduardo Escobar, who came off the bag and tagged a sliding Pillar well short of the base.	"I know it looks bad, and it's hard to put a positive spin on this," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "It's just bad baseball. There's no getting around it."	Suarez allowed nine runs in four innings. Suarez also collected his first RBI with an infield single in the second.	MARTE LIKES ORACLE	The Diamondbacks leadoff hitter is quite comfortable playing at Oracle Park. In 13 career games at the waterfront ballpark, Marte is batting .365 (19 for 52) with nine RBI.	TWO FIRSTS	The RBI by Cron and Suarez are the first of their careers.	MOVES	San Francisco recalled right-hander Dereck Rodriguez from Sacramento. Mac Williamson was designated for assignment. Williamson struck out five times on Thursday and three times Friday.	Arizona catcher John Ryan Murphy was designated for assignment to make room for Clarke.	TRAINERS ROOM	Giants: Reliever Trevor Gott was placed on the 10-day injured list with a right forearm strain.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks RHP Luke Weaver (3-3, 3.14 ERA) pitches Sunday and has 55 strikeouts over his last eight starts. Weaver has two wins in three career starts against San Francisco. RHP Shaun Anderson (0-0, 3.60) takes the mound for the Giants.	--	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

WASHINGTON --  Washington's bullpen has been a problem all season. Thanks to Patrick Corbin, it wasn't needed on Saturday.	Corbin pitched a four-hitter, Yan Gomes hit a three-run double and the Washington Nationals beat the Miami Marlins 5-0.	"He picked us up," Nationals manager Dave Martinez said of Corbin's timely performance. "Well-needed rest for our bullpen, for sure."	Corbin (5-2) faced the minimum through five innings while allowing two singles. The left-hander retired 10 straight from the end of the second until allowing a leadoff single in the sixth to Miguel Rojas.	He struck out five and walked one, needing 116 pitches to get through nine innings.	Corbin, who threw a career-high 118 pitches on May 4 at Philadelphia, said it didn't take much convincing on his part for Martinez to send him back out for the ninth while reliever Wander Suero warmed up in the bullpen.	"I felt good, I thought I could get three more," Corbin said about his mindset heading into the ninth. "So, I said I'll get the next three."	The Nationals bullpen had blown three consecutive games in the last series at the New York Mets.	After getting pinch-hitter Rosell Herrera to strike out looking, Corbin got Austin Dean to fly out to right field before Garrett Cooper grounded out to third base.	Corbin last pitched a complete game on April 17, 2018 while with Arizona.	Gomes' three-run double to right field capped a five-run fourth inning for the Nationals, who have taken the first two of the four-game series against Miami. Washington has yet to win three straight games this season.	Juan Soto's RBI single to right-center field scored Anthony Rendon and gave the Nationals a 1-0 lead. Soto scored two batters later on a throwing error by Brian Anderson to put the Nationals up 2-0. Soto later singled in the fifth and has a nine-game hitting streak.	Miami starter Sandy Alcantara (2-5) surrendered five runs -- four earned -- on six hits while striking out two in five innings.	Harold Ramirez had two of Miami's four hits on a single in the second and a double in the eighth and was the only Miami player to get into scoring position.	ROUGH WEEK	Although available, Washington closer Sean Doolittle wasn't needed Saturday. After one of the worst outings of his career Tuesday in New York, things didn't go much better on Friday when he allowed a leadoff home run and two singles before earning his ninth save. Doolittle's ERA more than doubled this week, jumping from 1.71 to 3.68.	Martinez said Doolittle's recent issues are not health-related.	"He knows what he needs to do," Martinez. "When you have a closer like that, they know how to work out their struggles ... The biggest thing is I don't want him to think something's wrong with him. He's good."	STREAK ENDED	The Marlins had their seven-game streak of hitting at least one home run snapped on Saturday. Miami's streak was its longest since a nine-game stretch in July 2017. Before the recent power surge, Miami had hit just 12 homers in the previous 27 games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: Called up RHP James Bourque from Double-A Harrisburg and optioned RHP Joe Ross -- who allowed three earned runs on Friday and has a 9.22 ERA -- to Triple-A Fresno. This is Bourque's first time on a major league roster. Recalled outfielder Andrew Stevenson (back spasms) from a rehab assignment and optioned him to Triple-A Fresno. RHP Anibal Sanchez (left hamstring strain) felt good after throwing a simulated game Friday and is expected to throw a bullpen session Sunday and then make a rehab start Wednesday.	UP NEXT	Marlins: LHP Caleb Smith (3-1, 2.38) has at least six strikeouts in all nine starts -- a Marlins club record to open a season. Smith earned the win against the Nationals on April 19 after allowing one run on five and striking out eight in six innings.	Nationals: RHP Erick Fedde (0-0, 2.87 ERA) makes his second start of the season in place of Sanchez. Fedde pitched a season-high five innings in his previous start on May 21 against the Mets while allowing one run on four hits.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  The Oakland Athletics are on a roll again, much like a year ago when they took off in mid-June and used a sensational second half to return to the playoffs for the first time in four years.	Mike Fiers won in his first start at the Coliseum since pitching a no-hitter earlier this month and the A's beat Seattle 6-5 on Saturday for their eighth straight win, a streak that has suspended game in the middle.	Matt Chapman homered and Ramon Laureano doubled in his fifth straight game, matching Miguel Tejada for the Oakland record not accomplished since 2003.	The A's keep winning and doing just enough even with reigning majors home run leader Khris Davis sidelined by a bruised left hip and side.	"We have a lot of good depth and we know we have really good players, some guys on the bench who would have been starting on any other team," Laureano said. "We feel pretty confident. Everything is clicking right now and it's fun. We've got to keep it rolling."	Domingo Santana hit two home runs and Mitch Haniger also connected for Seattle, which has lost five in a row.	Mariners third baseman Kyle Seager doubled and singled in his season debut after recovering from surgery to repair a tendon in his left hand that he hurt diving for a ball during spring training.	"It feels good to be out there. It was a lot of fun being around the guys and competing," Seager said. With his 1,156th appearance for Seattle, he moved past Harold Reynolds into seventh place in club history for games played.	Fiers (4-3) received a warm welcome when introduced before the game, his first at home since throwing a no-hitter against Cincinnati on May 7. He went six innings against Seattle, allowing three runs and five hits.	Blake Treinen gave up Santana's home run in the ninth before finishing for his 10th save in 12 tries.	On June 15 last year, the A's trailed Seattle by 11 games then wound up with 97 wins and a wild card. They certainly hope this current run might lead to another surge.	Yusei Kikuchi (3-2) faced Oakland for the third time in as many different ballparks this season. The Japanese lefty previously pitched against the A's in Tokyo and Seattle, taking a no-decision each time. He was done after 3 1/3 innings, giving up five runs and 10 hits -- matching his most surrendered this year.	Marcus Semien hit an RBI single that broke a 3-all tie in the fourth and Chad Pinder followed with a two-run double. Laureano, who has an eight-game hitting streak and also stole a base, provided an insurance run with a sacrifice fly in the eighth.	"He's swinging the bat great. He's feeling pretty confident, too," A's manager Bob Melvin said. "I think we're about ready to see him start to heat up."	ROSTER MOVES	The A's designated veteran right-hander Fernando Rodney -- with 582 career appearances over 17 big league seasons -- for assignment with his 0-2 record and 9.42 ERA in 17 outings. Melvin said he expects him to land with another club. Oakland selected the contract of Taiwanese left-hander Wei-Chung Wang from Triple-A Las Vegas. He was a non-roster invitee to spring training.	The Mariners optioned infielder Dylan Moore to Triple-A Tacoma after Friday night's game and transferred right-hander Sam Tuivailala to the 60-day injured list.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: 2B Dee Gordon saw a specialist in Orlando, Florida, on Friday for his bruised right wrist. The Mariners medical staff planned to discuss the injury later Saturday. ... On Friday in Seattle, RHP Felix Hernandez (stiffness in his pitching shoulder) played catch for the first time, throwing from up to 60 feet. "He feels good," manager Scott Servais said.	Athletics: Right fielder Stephen Piscotty was scratched with a stomach bug.	UP NEXT	Mariners: RHP Mike Leake (3-5, 4.73 ERA) beat the A's for his last win May 14. He is 0-2 lifetime with a 3.48 ERA in five starts at the Coliseum.	Athletics: LHP Brett Anderson (5-3, 4.14) is 8-5 with a 2.38 ERA in 20 matchups with 19 starts for his career vs. Seattle -- his most victories against any opponent.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

NEW YORK --  Needing to play catch-up yet again, the New York Mets got their biggest swings from backstops Tomas Nido and Wilson Ramos in another dramatic win.	Nido homered against Buck Farmer leading off the 13th inning, Ramos went deep twice and the Mets beat the Detroit Tigers 5-4 on Saturday for another comeback victory during this wild homestand.	Nido -- Ramos' backup who entered as a pinch-hitter in the 11th -- drove a 2-0 pitch from Farmer (3-4) just beyond leaping center fielder JaCoby Jones at the wall in right-center, ending a game full of wasted chances for both teams. Nido was doused with water at home plate, and Noah Syndergaard dumped a jumbo bag of popcorn over his head during an on-field postgame interview following the 25-year-old's third career homer.	It was Nido's first walk-off hit since high school.	"That was an unbelievable feeling," he said.	New York has won five of six at Citi Field this week despite trailing in all but one of those games. That came after the front office spoke up Monday to defend embattled second-year manager Mickey Callaway. The Mets (25-26) can climb back to .500 with a win Sunday.	Ramos drove in four and had New York's only three hits through eight innings, including a go-ahead, two-run shot in the sixth. He has three homers in two days, bringing his total to five for the season.	"I've been working really good in the cage right now," he said. "I'm getting my timing back."	It's only the second time in franchise history two catchers homered in the same game, following Gary Carter and Ed Hearn in 1986.	"It was like Mike Piazza back there or something," Callaway said.	Ramos also picked off Gordon Beckham at first base in the 11th. Ramos walked with one out in the bottom of the inning and was pinch-run for by pitcher Steven Matz.	All-Star closer Edwin Diaz entered with New York leading 4-3 in the eighth seeking his first four-out save of the season -- his first stab at one since Callaway changed his tune on using Diaz for more than three outs days earlier. Diaz replaced Robert Gsellman with a runner on third and quickly allowed a tying single to Jones for his first blown save as a Met. Diaz had converted 22 straight save chances dating to last season, including 12 this year.	Wilmer Font replaced Diaz to start the ninth and pitched through the 10th, freezing Jones with a 3-2 curveball to strand two runners.	Detroit left-hander Daniel Stumpf pitched out of a one-out, bases-loaded situation in the 11th, and New York's Hector Santiago (1-0) escaped an identical jam in the 12th with a strikeout and a flyout.	Detroit was 1 for 13 with runners in scoring position and stranded 14.	"We had our opportunities," manager Ron Gardenhire said.	Gardenhire used 20 players for the second time in his 13-season managerial career. He also used 20 while leading Minnesota over Milwaukee 6-5 in 14 innings on May 28, 2013.	"We don't get involved in stuff like this too often," Gardenhire said.	Dawel Lugo had a career-high four hits for Detroit, which has dropped 10 of 11 after ending a nine-game skid Friday.	Brandon Dixon put the Tigers ahead 3-2 in the sixth with his first career pinch-hit homer, a two-run shot against Tyler Bashlor.	Tigers left-hander Ryan Carpenter threw five efficient innings, allowing two runs and two hits over 56 pitches in his third career start, but he left trailing thanks in part to consecutive balk calls against him in the fourth. The balks advanced J.D. Davis from first to third after he reached on Lugo's error at third, and Davis then scored on Ramos' single.	Carpenter was initially confused by what triggered the infractions, and Gardenhire argued with crew chief Jerry Meals and second base umpire Ron Kulpa before having words with Carpenter. The issue was that Carpenter was coming to the set position twice.	"I had to explain to him, you just have to fix it right now or they're going to keep calling balks," Gardenhire said. "He didn't really understand it at first, but then he got it and did fine."	Gardenhire said Carpenter will remain in the rotation, with Gregory Soto going to Triple-A Toledo to make his next start.	Mets starter Jason Vargas navigated trouble effectively throughout his return from the injured list with a strained left hamstring. He had a runner on base in each of his five innings but limited Detroit to a run and five hits.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: INF Jordy Mercer was set to begin an injury rehab assignment with Toledo. Mercer has been out since May 9 with a right quad strain.	Mets: OF Michael Conforto again participated in baseball activities, and New York hopes he'll clear Major League Baseball's concussion protocol to return Sunday. ... INF Luis Guillorme was sent to Triple-A Syracuse to make room for Vargas, leaving New York with just 12 position players.

MILWAUKEE --  Philadelphia Phillies ace Jake Arrieta was terrific in his first win in a month.	The Milwaukee Brewers felt he got some help from plate umpire Mike Estabrook.	Arrieta pitched eight effective innings, Andrew McCutchen homered and the Phillies beat the Brewers 7-2 on Saturday.	"A really solid performance by Jake, who was absolutely cognizant of getting in the zone and giving us length," manager Gabe Kapler said. "It's exactly what our club needed."	Arrieta (5-4) allowed two runs and five hits, struck out eight and walked one in his first win since April 27. The 2015 NL Cy Young Award winner was 0-2 with a 4.30 ERA in his previous four starts.	It looked as if the right-hander was headed for his first complete game since 2016 before he ran into a bit of trouble in the eighth. Philadelphia had a 4-2 lead, but Milwaukee had a runner on third with two down and Lorenzo Cain at the plate.	Cain was ahead 3-1 in the count when Arrieta threw a pitch that the speedy leadoff man felt was a ball, which would have brought NL MVP Christian Yelich to the plate. Instead, Estabrook called a strike and Cain grounded out on the next pitch.	Counsell began arguing with Estabrook from the dugout and was ejected. The usually mild-mannered Counsell then came onto the field and engaged in a heated face-to-face shouting match with Estabrook.	"It's two pitches. It's Yelich on-deck. It's the tying run," Counsell said. "It's an enormous part of the game. They were just clear balls. They have to get those ones right."	Cain felt Estabrook missed two pitches in his crucial at-bat.	"I definitely should have walked there," Cain said. "But it'll do me no good (complaining) about umpires because nothing's going to happen. It definitely could have been a game-changer if I walk there and bring (Yelich) to the plate."	Arrieta said his plan throughout the game was to throw pitches with movement that were down in the zone.	"After I let the ball go, whatever happens is out of my control," he said. "There might have been some borderline pitches there, but it happens every game."	Andrew McCutchen, Cesar Hernandez, Rhys Hoskins and J.T. Realmuto homered in Philadelphia's third consecutive win. Hoskins finished with three hits and two RBI.	Milwaukee lost for the fifth time in its last seven games. Mike Moustakas hit his 13th homer in the seventh, but the Brewers finished with just five hits.	McCutchen drove Jhoulys Chacin's second pitch off the center-field scoreboard at Miller Park. McCutchen is batting .414 (12 for 29) with two homers and nine RBI during his last seven games.	The Phillies added a run in the second when Jean Segura walked with the bases loaded. Hernandez homered with two out in the third and added a run-scoring single in the fifth to extend the lead to 4-0.	Hernan Perez's run-scoring groundout got Milwaukee within two in the eighth. But Hoskins hit a two-run homer in the ninth and Realmuto followed with his eighth homer.	Chacin (3-6) allowed seven hits, struck out six and walked three in five innings.	Estabrook also tossed Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun in the fourth after the slugger struck out and complained to Estabrook as returned to the dugout.	"Jake Arrieta is really good. His stuff is really good. Today, he was really good. He didn't need extra help," Braun said.	Braun was walking to the dugout when he was ejected.	"I've said far worse and not gotten thrown out," Braun said. "I was very surprised that I was thrown out in that situation. Usually, if you get thrown out it's more confrontational."	Braun said he remained in the clubhouse after being ejected.	"I sat here and watched the game and saw a lot of pitches that were balls called strikes," Braun said.	Umpire crew chief Paul Emmel wouldn't allow a pool reporter to speak with Estabrook. Emmel declined to directly address comments made by the Brewers.	"I'm not going to react to somebody else's comments," Emmel said. "We have our system that we're graded on. We have our technology and we go off that. We're held accountable for our mistakes."	Emmel said he couldn't tell who the aggressor was in the confrontation between Estabrook and Counsell.	"They were touching each other," Emmel said. "The league will handle that."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: RHP Pat Neshek was placed on the 10-day injured list with a right shoulder strain. RHP David Robertson (right elbow) was transferred to the 60-day IL, and RHP J.D. Hammer was brought up from Triple-A Lehigh Valley.	Brewers: C Manny Pina, on the 10-day IL with a right hamstring strain, will accompany the team to Minnesota for a two-game series against the Twins that begins Monday. He'll then likely be sent on a rehab assignment. "The last step will be running the bases and we'll do that in Minnesota," Counsell said. ... INF Travis Shaw (right wrist strain) remains on a rehab assignment at Triple-A San Antonio. "We're going to let him play for a while, that's what's important," Counsell said. "We'll let him just play and see what's going on." Shaw was hitting .163 with four homers and eight RBI in 135 at-bats this season when he went on the IL.	UP NEXT	Phillies: Zach Elfin (5-4, 2.76 ERA) will make his second start of the season. He is 2-1 with a 3.94 ERA in three career starts against the Brewers.	Brewers: Brandon Woodruff (6-1, 3.51 ERA) pitched a career-high eight innings on Sunday at Atlanta. He hasn't allowed a run in two career starts (10 innings pitched) against the Phillies.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

CLEVELAND --  Charlie Morton returned to the clubhouse Saturday afternoon and waited. Then he waited some more, anticipating the arrival of thunderstorms that never materialized.	The delay didn't faze him, nor did it stop his career-best unbeaten streak.	Morton struck out a season-high 10 and allowed one run over six innings -- his 18th straight start without a loss -- as the Tampa Bay Rays beat the Cleveland Indians 6-2 in a game that began nearly three hours late because of an incorrect weather forecast.	"Well, it turned out to be a 7 o'clock game, so it wasn't bad," he quipped. "Saturday 7 o'clock games are fine, just fine. I wasn't out there (during the delay), but I heard the wind was really bad, so we just kind of hung out and stayed ready and it turned out all right."	Morton (5-0), who gave up three hits and threw a season-high 106 pitches, hasn't lost since last Aug. 11 with Houston. The right-hander is 8-0 with a 3.10 ERA during his streak, which is the second-longest in the majors behind the 19 by the Dodgers' Clayton Kershaw.	The first pitch was postponed from 4:10 until 6:58, but the conditions remained dry and warm throughout, except for a several-minute spell of light rain.	"I'm not a weatherman, but when you get those lake effect and storms rolling in here, sometimes they nail you and pop out of nowhere," Rays manager Kevin Cash said. "We totally understood the situation.	"Charlie didn't let it bother him and he made some big pitches. What that breaking ball is on, that really is a big equalizer for him like you saw tonight."	Ji-Man Choi and Tommy Pham each hit two-run homers and Brandon Lowe added a solo shot for Tampa Bay, which is in the midst of playing 34 games in 34 days through June 23. Pham upped his hitting streak to 11 and Lowe had two RBI.	Choi's blast to left gave the Rays a 3-1 lead in the fifth, while Pham's rocket to center in the seventh made it 6-1 and chased Indians starter Carlos Carrasco (4-5).	Carrasco dropped his second straight start, giving up five earned runs in 6 1/3 innings. The righty has surrendered nine homers in 31 innings during five May outings.	"See the fastball and hit it, that's what they've been looking for," he said. "I feel a little bit disappointed about those pitches because I didn't locate them."	Carlos Santana went 2 for 4 with a homer and double for Cleveland, which has lost five of six and fell to 4-6 on its season-high 11-game homestand.	TERRY TOSSED	Indians manager Terry Francona was ejected in the sixth by third base umpire Eric Cooper for arguing that Jose Ramirez did not swing at a pitch that hit him. It was his first ejection since 2016.	"I thought it was a poor call and I told him I thought he had an even poorer night (behind the plate) the night before," Francona said. "Sometimes their attitude has just as much to do with ejections."	COMING, GOING	The Indians recalled LF Greg Allen and selected the contract of LHP Josh D. Smith from Triple-A Columbus. RHP Adam Plutko and C Eric Haase were optioned to the Clippers. The 29-year-old Smith made his big league debut with 1 2/3 scoreless innings. Francona said Allen's stay could be brief as Cleveland needs a starting pitcher Tuesday in Boston.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: 3B Matt Duffy (left hamstring tightness) has not returned to his rehab assignment at Triple-A Durham since aggravating his injury Wednesday at Norfolk.	Indians: OF Tyler Naquin (left calf strain), who has been on the 10-day injured list since May 11, ran the bases without any issues Friday at Progressive Field.	UP NEXT	Rays: RHP Ryne Stanek (0-1, 3.38 ERA) will be the opener in the four-game series finale. Eleven of his 13 starts this year -- all two innings or fewer -- have been scoreless.	Indians: RHP Trevor Bauer (4-3, 3.95 ERA) takes on Tampa Bay for the first time since June 22, 2016. In five home appearances this season, he is 1-2 with a 6.14 ERA.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

ST. LOUIS --  This time, the St. Louis Cardinals made a couple of big plays down the stretch.	Hasn't happened very much in May.	Pinch hitter Jedd Gyorko connected for a three-run homer during St. Louis' four-run eighth inning, helping the Cardinals top the Atlanta Braves 6-3 on Saturday night.	"That's a big win for us," said Gyorko, who has seen limited action this season. "We've been struggling, this has been a tough month. Hopefully, we can look later this month and going into next month and this is a win that got us going."	Paul Goldschmidt and Matt Carpenter each had three hits as St. Louis improved to 7-15 in May. The Cardinals (26-25) were in danger of falling below the .500 mark for the first time since April 7.	Andrew Miller (2-2) worked a scoreless eighth for the win, and Jordan Hicks got three outs for his 10th save.	"That is a representation of how we do when we put it all together," Cardinals manager Mike Shildt. "It's pretty special when you see it there. It was hard fought across the board. Guys scratched, clawed, believed, and dug in, and got it done."	The Braves wasted another solid performance by Mike Soroka, who allowed two runs, one earned, and five hits in six innings. The rookie right-hander has allowed one earned run or less in his first eight starts this season.	"I just know he's pitching really good," Braves manager Brian Snitker said. "I just sit and watch him out there and how he just keeps pitching. You don't know if he's five up or five down, he's just there making pitches. He's fun to watch."	Nick Markakis had two hits and scored a run for the Braves, who had won four of five. Austin Riley, Tyler Flowers and Ozzie Albies each had a run-scoring double.	Atlanta right-hander Dan Winkler was charged with four runs in one inning. He seemed to be in good shape until a 2 minute, 19-second review overturned what would have been a double play. That allowed Paul DeJong to stay at first and helped fuel the Cardinals' rally.	DeJong scored on Carpenter's single before Gyorko hit a drive to left-center for his first homer of the season. It was Gyorko's second career pinch-hit homer.	"It just spun," Winkler said. "It was a cutter that didn't move, right down the middle. It spun, it stayed middle and he hit it a long way."	St. Louis grabbed a 2-1 lead on Goldschmidt's RBI single in the fifth. But Flowers and Albies each drove in a run after Carlos Martinez relieved Dakota Hudson with one out and a runner on third in the seventh.	Hudson was charged with two runs and five hits in the longest outing of his career.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Braves: OF Ender Inciarte (lumbar strain) hasn't thrown or hit yet, and the Braves hope more work in the pool and some rest will get him ready for a return.	CIVIC PRIDE	The Cardinals get a rare Memorial Day off Monday, marking just the second time since 2000 that St. Louis hasn't played on the holiday. But the team pointed out in its pregame notes that the St. Louis Blues play Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Final that day at the Boston Bruins.	STAYING THE COURSE	The Braves have three of the next nine days off, allowing the starters to get some extra rest. They'll stick with their current rotation.	`'We'll just continue through and give everybody the extra days and take advantage of that," Snitker said.	UP NEXT	Braves: RHP Julio Teheran (3-4, 3.67 ERA) goes for his second win in a row after suffering a three-game losing streak. He has made it past the sixth inning just once this year, going seven in a 4-3 loss to San Diego on April 30.	Cardinals: RHP Jack Flaherty (4-3, 4.19 ERA) has surrendered four or fewer hits in seven of his last eight starts. However, St. Louis is only 4-4 in those games, including getting shut out twice.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

HOUSTON --  With the bases loaded in the ninth inning, Carlos Correa had a straight-forward approach.	"I'm thinking, `I've got to finish this game," Correa said.	He did, hitting an RBI single to give the Houston Astros a 4-3 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Saturday night.	After Boston tied it in the top of the inning, Aledmys Diaz led off the bottom with a double to left off Matt Barnes (2-1). Following walks to Alex Bregman and Michael Brantley, Correa hit a blooper down the right-field line over a five-man infield.	"I didn't really want to give the at-bat to Yuli (Gurriel)," Correa said. "A walk or a sac fly would get the job done. I'm not trying to do too much, I'm just trying to put the ball in play to right-center field and it happened to fall for a hit."	Barnes said the issues in the ninth were on him.	"I just stunk," Barnes said. "Flat out. I couldn't command stuff. ... I just didn't execute enough pitches. I left stuff over the middle of the plate or I wasn't around the plate enough."	The winner was Correa's first since June 23, 2018, against the Royals	"Once I hit it, I knew it was going to stay fair," Correa said. "It was on a line over the first baseman. That's why I started celebrating right when I hit it."	After Roberto Osuna (3-0) loaded the bases, Christian Vazquez hit a two-run single for Boston to tie it at three.	Osuna recovered to strike out Steve Pearce and got Andrew Benintendi on a popup and a Mitch Moreland groundout to end the inning.	"That's situational hitting," Boston manager Alex Cora said. "We have to put the ball in play there. First and third, we have to put the ball in play, and we didn't at least drive the ball through the infield. We didn't do the job, and we paid the price."	The blown save ended a streak of 28 straight converted saves for Osuna.	"It's one of those days they attacked me early, but I was able to make the adjustment late in the inning and keep the leading run on third," Osuna said.	Josh Reddick and Tyler White hit RBI singles in the sixth for Houston, and Benintendi cut the lead to 2-1 with RBI single in the seventh.	The Astros answered with Gurriel's RBI single in the bottom of the seventh.	"Certainly a big win for us and the way we came back," Houston manager AJ Hinch said. "It's again proof that they're never out of a game. They're always in the game."	Brad Peacock yielded four hits and struck out eight in six scoreless innings.	David Price lasted three batters and 15 pitches before leaving with two out in the first due to flu-like symptoms. Price said he had been feeling sick for three or four days, with achiness all over, but he was trying to make pitches.	"I could have just ducked this start from the get go," Price said. "I didn't want to do that. I didn't want to put us in that position. I went out there and tried to take the ball and (Cora) didn't like what he saw, so he took me out of the game. I wanted to stay in the game when he came out there. That's that."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: INF Brock Holt (shoulder) was scheduled to arrive in Houston prior to the game Saturday and could be activated from the injured list as early as Sunday. ... 2B Dustin Pedroia (knee) did not play Saturday and would not play in a rehabilitation assignment on Sunday, Cora said, adding that the Red Sox would check him out Monday. "It's another red flag, Cora said. "He didn't feel right yesterday. He's not going to push it. He's not going to make it worse," Cora said. ... RHP Nathan Eovaldi (elbow) threw a bullpen session Saturday that Cora characterized as "really good".	Astros: OF George Springer was placed on the 10-day injured list with a left hamstring strain. Hinch said he expected Springer will be out longer than the 10 days but no timetable was given. The Astros recalled OF Derek Fisher from Triple-A Round Rock to take Springer's spot on the roster. ... 2B Jose Altuve (hamstring) will start a rehabilitation assignment with Round Rock on Sunday. ... C Max Stassi left in the fifth with left knee discomfort.	UP NEXT	Red Sox: LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (4-3, 5.43 ERA) starts Sunday in the finale of the three-game series.	Astros: RHP Justin Verlander (8-1, 2.24) makes his 12th start Sunday 11 strikeouts shy of tying Cy Young for 21st on the all-time strikeouts list.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PITTSBURGH --  Hyun-Jin Ryu knew his scoreless streak wouldn't last forever. So when it finally came to an end at 32 innings against Pittsburgh, the Los Angeles Dodgers' veteran pitcher shrugged.	"I wasn't really thinking about the streak to begin with," Ryu said.	There were more pressing matters on Saturday night anyway. Namely trying to find his way on a night when he admittedly didn't have his best stuff. Though he lacked the crispness that marked the best stretch of his injury-marred six-year career, Ryu found a way anyway in a 7-2 victory.	Ryu (7-1) allowed a season-high 10 hits but managed to clamp down when necessary to get through six innings as the Dodgers beat the Pirates for the 10th straight time.	"They were pretty aggressive at the plate and some of my pitches weren't as sharp as I wanted them to be," Ryu said after his ERA ticked up to 1.65. "At the end of the day I did give up a lot of hits and it hurts to give up that many hits but I was able to limit damage."	And do a little damage at the plate in the process. Ryu gave the Dodgers the lead for good in the fourth when he turned a full-count fastball from Joe Musgrove (3-5) into a double to the gap in right-center field that scored Chris Taylor to put Los Angeles up 3-2.	"I think it was the first time this year I made hard contact at the plate and it just happened to be a good hit," Ryu said.	Asked if he felt it was a home run, the 32-year-old joked "it was hit well but I have to work on my launch angle."	Maybe Ryu was just trying to fit in. His double was one of eight by the Dodgers on the night, the most by any team in the majors this season. Cody Bellinger and Corey Seager both doubled and drove in two runs.  Bellinger finished 2 for 4 to boost his major-league leading batting average to .391. Max Muncy added two doubles of his own as Los Angeles won for the eighth time in 10 games.	"We're very dynamic," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. "We don't discriminate against the double."	Ryu's scoreless streak that began on May 1 against San Francisco ended at 32 innings -- the 10th longest in franchise history -- when Pittsburgh's Josh Bell led off the second with a double then raced home when Los Angeles catcher Russell Martin threw wide of third base trying to cut down Bell after Melky Cabrera's swinging bunt. Cabrera scored later in the inning on an RBI single by Cole Tucker to tie the score at 2.	It was all the Pirates would get against Ryu. Though Starling Marte had three of Pittsburgh's 11 hits while Bell and Kevin Newman chipped in two hits apiece the Pirates lost for the fourth time in five games after going 2 for 15 with runners in scoring position and leaving eight men on base.	"We pushed a guy that nobody's pushed for a while," Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said. "Nine hits through the first five innings (but) ... we weren't able to add on."	URIAS RETURNS	Dodgers reliever Julio Urias pitched two scoreless innings in his first appearance since returning from administrative leave following his arrest for investigation of misdemeanor domestic battery earlier this month. There was a small smattering of boos when Urias was introduced.	"With Julio nothing surprises us," Roberts said. "Hadn't pitched in a major league game in quite some time. Ball was coming out good ... I thought two innings was perfect for him."	BANGED UP BUCS	Pittsburgh catcher Francisco Cervelli left in the fourth inning with concussion-like symptoms shortly after getting hit by Bellinger's bat. Cervelli, who has dealt with concussions each of the last two seasons, will be re-evaluated on Sunday. If he heads to the injured list, he'd push Pittsburgh's total number of players who have been put on the list to 21, the most in the majors.	"I think there's a part of (Cervelli) that doesn't ever want to come out of games," Hurdle said. "There's a part of him that also thinks, `You know what, I'm not going to do myself any good by continuing, either.' He's had enough experienced through it all by now that he knows when it's time to back away."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: 3B Justin Turner was held out of the lineup as a preventative measure due to discomfort in his left shin. ... RHP Pedro Baez (upper right leg contusion) was given a third straight game off.	Pirates: RHP Chris Stratton (right side discomfort) was placed on the 10-day injured list and moved Lonnie Chisenhall (fractured right index finger) to the 60-day injured list, though Chisenhall is eligible to return next week. Pittsburgh recalled RHP Dovydas Neverauskas from Triple-A Indianapolis and selected the contract of RHP Rookie Davis. Davis and Neverauskas both pitched in relief of Musgrove in an effort to help out Pittsburgh's overtaxed bullpen.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: Kenta Maeda (5-2, 3.51 ERA) returns from a stint on the injured list with a left adductor contusion on Sunday. Opponents are hitting just .220 off Maeda in nine starts.	Pirates: Chris Archer (1-4, 5.55 ERA) looks for his first victory since April 7 in the series finale.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Chance Adams didn't get to Kauffman Stadium on Saturday until midway through the first game of a day-night doubleheader.	He had an early flight out of Syracuse, New York, then caught a connecting flight in Chicago before finally getting to the stadium around 1 p.m.	Adams, called up as the 26th player for the New York Yankees, took advantage of his opportunity in the nightcap.	Adams (1-0) threw four innings to earn his first major league victory as the Yankees held on to beat the Kansas City Royals 6-5 Saturday night, completing a sweep of a doubleheader for their seventh straight win.	After Chad Green threw one inning as the Yankees' opener, Adams allowed three runs and five hits, with a couple of misplayed balls in the outfield leading to two runs in the fourth inning.	"I'm just going out there and trying to make my pitches and give the team a chance to win, but I feel good about my performance," Adams said.	Adams threw three shutout innings in his first appearance this season on May 19 against Tampa Bay to earn his first career save.	"Hopefully, it's something that's a building block for him," Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. "He's been throwing the ball well in Triple-A, you can tell he's pitching with more confidence up here. He'll be back and he'll help us at some point this year, especially if he continues to throw the ball like that."	Austin Romine and Cameron Maybin, the No. 8 and 9 hitters in the lineup, each drove in two in New York's five-run second inning.	"It's been like that much of the year for us, we've gotten contributions up and down the lineup," Boone said. "We've hit guys in different spots a lot and it's kind of come from a different place on most nights and we needed all of it."	Romine finished with three hits and Maybin also had an RBI single in the third as New York won both games after severe thunderstorms postponed Friday night's contest.	Luke Voit hit a go-ahead home in the seventh inning and Thairo Estrada added a two-run double in the eighth inning of the opener to power the Yankees to a 7-3 victory.	Jonathan Holder, Tommy Kahnle, Zach Britton and Aroldis Chapman each threw one inning in relief to close out the win in the second game. Chapman allowed a run on a walk, error and sacrifice fly, but was still able to notch his 250th career save, and 14th this season.	"I'm excited about it," Chapman said. "My objective and desire is to have many, many more, but you have to be excited about this night and excited for the number it is."	The Yankees jumped all over Royals starter Jorge Lopez (0-6) in the second inning. The first seven batters all reached base, scoring five runs along the way. DJ LeMahieu capped the scoring in the inning with an RBI single, chasing Lopez from the game after facing just 10 batters.	The Royals' bullpen held the Yankees down after the big second inning, allowing one run and four hits in eight innings of work.	"It was pretty special to be a part of that," said Glenn Sparkman, who threw 3 1/3 innings.	Hunter Dozier doubled twice after going hitless in the opener, driving in Adalberto Mondesi in the first inning and coming around to score on Jorge Soler's double in the fourth inning.	J.A. Happ (4-3) threw six strong innings in the opener, striking out 10. He allowed only a single hit until a familiar problem showed up in the sixth when Whit Merrifield hit a tying, three-run homer. It was the 14th homer Happ has allowed, tied for second most in the majors.	But unlike past home runs, Happ threw a good pitch, and Merrifield simply put a good swing on the ball.	"You tip your cap. He hit a ball at his shoulders," Happ said.	Voit quickly restored the Yankees' lead when he connected off Scott Barlow (1-1) for a 470-foot home run and New York's bullpen closed out the win.	"It doesn't matter if I'm hitting, Gary (Sanchez), Gleyber (Torres), whoever. Everybody calls us the Baby Bombers, so I feel like someone will hit a home run or get a big hit," Voit said.	Voit grew up near St. Louis, was drafted by the Royals out of high school, went to Missouri State and made his major league debut with the Cardinals.	Mondesi stole his major league-best 18th base in the opener.	Barlow had his second straight shaky outing for the Royals. His ERA sat at 2.01 after a scoreless outing against the Los Angeles Angels on Sunday, but got tagged for four runs in 1 2/3 innings on Wednesday in St. Louis and gave up four more runs Saturday in 1 1/3 innings.	"We gave up six runs on three hanging sliders today and Barlow threw two of them," Royals manager Ned Yost said.	CONSECUTIVE TWINBILLS	The Royals were back in action for the first time since playing a doubleheader against St. Louis on Wednesday, which also was caused by stormy weather. Kansas City is playing consecutive doubleheaders for just the eighth time in franchise history, and first time since Aug. 13-14, 1983. It's just the second time Kansas City has played consecutive doubleheaders against two different opponents, the other time occurring on April 19 and 22, 1972, against Oakland and the Chicago White Sox.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: SS Didi Gregorius, recovering from Tommy John surgery last October, went 0 for 3 and played seven errorless innings at Bradenton in his first injury rehabilitation game for Class A Tampa.	ROSTER MOVES	Royals: Kansas City recalled LHP Brian Flynn from Triple-A Omaha and optioned RHP Richard Lovelady. Lovelady remained with the team as the 26th player for the second game. Flynn hasn't pitched in the majors yet this season after spraining the UCL in his throwing arm late in spring training.	UP NEXT	The Royals and Yankees will close out their three-game set on Sunday.	Royals LHP Danny Duffy (3-1) will try for his fourth straight win in the finale of the three-game series Sunday. RHP Domingo German (9-1) will pitch for New York, seeking his major league-best 10th win.	---	More AP MLB:https://apnews.com/MLB andhttps://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

DENVER --  Andrew Cashner tried to give the tired Baltimore bullpen a breather, but fatigue ended his night early. Josh Lucas rescued him and his fellow Orioles relievers with a strong performance in a tough environment.	Lucas threw three shutout innings for his first career save and was backed by homers from Jonathan Villar and Renato Nunez in Baltimore's 9-6 win over the Colorado Rockies on Saturday night.	Villar and Nunez both finished with three hits and Pedro Severino had four hits to help the Orioles end a seven-game skid and overcome Nolan Arenado's big night. Nunez has homered in four straight games.	"The biggest thing tonight was Josh Lucas and how he did coming out of the bullpen," said Cashner, who came into Saturday 0-2 with a 7.94 in five career starts in Denver. "Three innings, his first save in the big leagues."	Lucas came through on a night Baltimore manager Brandon Hyde said only three relievers were available because of the amount of innings the bullpen has thrown of late. Miguel Castro gave up a solo home run in his lone inning but Lucas shut the door to help Cashner (5-2) get a rare win at Coors Field.	Lucas gave up a hit and walked one.	"Trying to pound the zone, trying to give the guys a rest," he said. "They've been taxed heavily this last week. Trying to eat innings."	Arenado had three hits, including his 200th career home run, and drove in the first five runs for Colorado. Chris Iannetta also homered for the Rockies.	Rockies starter Kyle Freeland (2-6) failed to pitch beyond the fourth inning for the second straight game and continued his rough start to the season. He won 17 games in 2018 but after starting this year with a win on opening day he is 1-6 and hasn't recorded a victory in more than five weeks.	Things started badly for the left-hander. Baltimore scored twice in the first and led 3-1 after Nunez's solo homer in the third. After Arenado's three-run shot in the bottom of the third gave Colorado a 4-3 lead, Villar answered with a three-run homer of his own on a full count to put the Orioles ahead 7-4 in the fourth.	"He's just not making a critical pitch at critical times," Rockies manager Bud Black said of Freeland "The backbreaker, the crusher, was the three-run homer. The 3-2 pitch was a breaking ball, Villar stayed back enough, got it airborne and hit it out."	Arenado continued his hot stretch in May. He didn't hit his first home run this season until April 14, in Colorado's 12th game, but he has hit eight this month, including two Friday night, to give him a team-high 14.	"I feel real good. I'm slowing the game down and slowing my body down," said Arenado, who raised his average to .333. "I'm putting together quality at-bats. I am trying to think too much into it."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rockies: Charlie Blackmon was out of the lineup for the second straight game with a calf strain but Black said the outfielder is making progress. "He went through some activity in the training room and weight room and our trainers are encouraged," Black said. "No timetable but we're all encouraged that Charlie's feeling better and his activity level stepped up (Saturday)."	CELEBRATING GOOD TIMES	The Orioles had lost 12 of 14 with half of those losses by two or fewer runs so getting a rare win was a reason to celebrate despite the 16-36 record.	"I want the guys to enjoy every win because it's so hard to do," Hyde said. "It's hard to win in the big leagues, period, so I want the guys to enjoy it."	The dugout didn't relax until Trevor Story grounded out to end the game.	"Man, here in Colorado there's never enough runs," Cashner said. "Even if you have 15 runs on the board. I've seen them score nine runs with two outs before. There's never enough runs in this ballpark."	UP NEXT	Baltimore RHP David Hess (1-6, 6.75) is looking for his first win since April 1st when he goes against Rockies righty German Marquez (5-2, 3.38) in the final of the three-game series on Sunday.	---	More AP baseball coverage: www.apnews.com/MLB and www.twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Jared Walsh has seemingly done it all in his short major league career. The rookie has hit and pitched, and now added his first RBI and game-ending hit to his accomplishments.	Walsh's pinch-single to left field in the ninth inning landed between two Rangers to score Kole Calhoun as the Los Angeles Angels rallied for a 3-2 win over the Texas Rangers.	Calhoun drove in the tying run earlier in the inning with an RBI double and then scored the winner on Walsh's hit.	"It's fun. I get to play baseball every day," said Walsh, who was engulfed by teammates in an emotional on-field celebration. "It's the stuff you dream about as a little kid and here we are with an awesome group of guys that have been grinding it out the last few days. I couldn't be more happy."	Walsh only has 10 at-bats, but the 25-year-old is making the most of them. The two-way player even pitched in a lopsided game earlier this week. Nothing could compare to this clutch hit and that ball, which was authenticated, will hold a special place in his collection, he said.	"That was awesome," Walsh said. "I hadn't gotten to play in a few days, so any way I can contribute, I'm really happy with. Luckily, I got the knock when my name was called."	Neither Rangers left fielder Hunter Pence nor shortstop Elvis Andrus were able to make the play on Walsh's hit off Shawn Kelley (3-1) and the ball dropped, allowing Calhoun to score and give the Angels a wild victory in which they led most of the way and snapped a five-game losing streak.	"That's a play (Andrus will) tell you he should make," Rangers manager Chris Woodward said. "He is one of the best in the league at going back on balls. It's obviously a tough play if he didn't make it."	Calhoun, who finished 3 for 3 with two RBI and two runs scored, also homered in the third inning to give Los Angeles a 1-0 lead that they held until the ninth.	Ronald Guzman doubled to deep center field to score pinch-runner Danny Santana to tie it with one out in the ninth. Rougned Odor, given a rare start off, then had a pinch-single to right field off Hansel Robles (2-0) to drive in Guzman with the go-ahead run.	It was the first time Robles allowed a run at Angel Stadium this season.	Calhoun tied it back up in the bottom of the inning to drive in Luis Rengifo, who ran through a stop sign by Angels third base coach Mike Gallego and dove headfirst safely at home. Calhoun then scored the winner to end Texas' five-game win streak.	"I saw (the sign) but after I touched third base, I saw it after," Rengifo said with a smile. "I can't stop."	Mike Minor had another solid outing, allowing just one run and five hits in six innings but didn't figure into the decision. He struck out five and walked two. Calhoun's 10th homer of the season was the first hit Minor allowed after retiring the first six batters.	Tyler Skaggs pitched well and was in line to get the win until Robles blew the save opportunity. Skaggs allowed just three hits in 5 2/3 shutout innings and struck out seven using 93 pitches.	"That's all we've been working on, just being aggressive early in the count," Skaggs said. "Just continue to pound the strike zone. That's going to help me out a lot."	Andrus, just reinstated from the injured list Saturday, reached base four times, picking up where he left off. He was 2 for 3 with two singles, a walk and reached on an error.	SHO THEM	Shohei Ohtani reached base on an infield single in the fourth inning. He was called out on a close play at first base but the play was overturned upon review. He has reached base safely now in 13 of his last 15 games since coming off the injured list.	REMEMBERING FRALEY	The Angels had a moment of silence before Saturday's game for Gerry Fraley, a longtime baseball writer at The Dallas Morning News. Fraley, 64, died Saturday after a two-year battle with cancer.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: OF Justin Upton (surgery turf toe) took batting practice for the first time since surgery. He's still probably a few weeks away from a return, according to manager Brad Ausmus. ... C Kevan Smith (7-day Injured List, concussion) has been cleared to do activity in the weight room and feels 100 percent, Ausmus said ... RHP Luis Garcia (back) was reinstated from the IL.	UP NEXT	Rangers: RHP Ariel Jurado (1-2, 2.20 ERA) is starting on three days' rest after recording his first career hold in a relief appearance in Texas' 2-1 win over Seattle on Wednesday. This will be just his second start of the season but 11th appearance.	Angels: LHP Andrew Heaney (0-0, 0.00 ERA) will make his first start of the season. He has been on the injured list all season with elbow inflammation sustained in spring training. He made a career-high 30 starts last year and was 7-3 with a 3.22 ERA in 14 starts at Angel Stadium.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

TORONTO --  Blue Jays rookie Cavan Biggio grew up watching his Hall of Fame dad, Craig, hit home runs for the Houston Astros.	On Sunday, father and son reversed roles.	Biggio had three hits, including his first career home run, Lourdes Gurriel Jr. had four hits and homered for the third straight game, and Toronto beat the San Diego Padres 10-1 Sunday to avoid a three-game sweep.	With his famous father and more than 10 other friends and family watching from the stands, Biggio got his first hit with a ground ball single through the right side in the second. He hit a solo home run into the fourth deck off left-hander Matt Wisler in the fourth, then added an RBI single in Toronto's four-run fifth.	"I've always wanted to do what my dad did, ever since a young age, and finally here we've kind of switched roles," the younger Biggio said. "He's in the seats now and I'm on the field. So that's pretty cool because it's everything I ever wanted."	Recalled from Triple-A Buffallo Friday slog with Gurriel Jr., Biggio had started 0 for 6 before his single.	"After I got that first hit, I felt like I could finally exhale and finally just play the game," Biggio said. "It was a big relief."	Biggio's big crowd was waiting for him as he left the clubhouse following the game, admiring a pair of souvenir balls from his milestone game.	Toronto's Justin Smoak hit two home runs, a two-run blast off Luis Perdomo in the fifth and a three-run drive off Adam Warren in the eighth. The homers were his 10th and 11th of the season.	The Blue Jays, who came in having lost four straight and 10 of 12 at home, finished with a season-high 17 hits.	Toronto rookie Vladimir Guerrero Jr. snapped an 0 for 14 slump with a double in the first. He finished 3 for 5, the second three-hit game of his brief career.	Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said he got chills watching Gurriel Jr. and Biggio go back-to-back in the fourth. Biggio, Gurriel Jr. and Guerrero Jr. combined to finish 10 for 13 with four RBI.	"It felt like that's what's coming here," Montoyo said. "That's the future."	BIggio also turned an unassisted double play in the seventh, catching Manuel Margot's liner and stepping on second base to retire Austin Allen, who had strayed too far off the bag.	Gurriel Jr. had the first four-hit game of his career. He singled and scored in the second, homered off Wisler immediately before Biggio's blast in the fourth, doubled and scored in the fifth, and singled in the seventh.	Right-hander Marcus Stroman (3-6) pitched five innings to win consecutive starts for the first time this season. He allowed one run and five hits, walked one and struck out two.	Wil Myers hit a leadoff homer off Stroman in the fifth, his 10th, but that was all for the Padres, who scored 19 runs and hit a team-record seven homers Saturday.	It was the first home run off Stroman by a right-handed batter since Boston's Xander Bogaerts hit one on July 15, 2018.	"We kind of dug a hole we couldn't dig ourselves out of," manager Andy Green said.	San Diego saw its five-game winning streak snapped, and lost an interleague game for the first time this season. The Padres are 4-1 against AL opponents.	Left-hander Robbie Erlin started for San Diego in place of rookie right-hander Chris Paddack, who was scratched because of a stiff neck. Paddack's next start is expected to be Wednesday at Yankee Stadium.	Erlin (0-1) allowed one run and three hits in two innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: OF Franmil Reyes (left shoulder) sat for the second straight game.	Blue Jays: LHP Tim Mayza was placed on the 10-day injured list because of a nerve issue in his left elbow. To replace Mayza, the Blue Jays recalled RHP Jacob Waguespack from Triple-A Buffalo.	SHOWING SOLIDARITY	Stroman and Giles came up with the idea to have the entire team dress in Raptors t-shirts for the flight to Tampa after Toronto clinched a berth in the NBA Finals Saturday night. Many players wore red shirts bearing the Raptors' `We the North' slogan, while Stroman opted for a red Fred VanVleet replica jersey.	UNLIKELY ARRIVAL	Waguespack went undrafted in 2015, later signing with Philadelphia. This is his first time on a big league roster. "It's a dream come true," he said. "Guys like me aren't supposed to be here."	UP NEXT	Padres: LHP Matt Strahm (2-3, 306) starts the opener of a three-game series at Yankee Stadium. Strahm has allowed two earned runs or fewer in eight straight starts. The Yankees have not named a starter.	Blue Jays: RHP Aaron Sanchez (3-4, 3.79) starts the opener of a three-game series in Tampa Bay. Sanchez has a 1.97 ERA in 15 career games against the Rays. Tampa Bay has not named a starter.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

NEW YORK --  Todd Frazier is known for longballs more than small ball. Yet without even taking a full swing, he swung things in the New York Mets' favor.	Frazier cleverly came up with a push bunt and the Mets took off from there, beating the Detroit Tigers 4-3 Sunday for their sixth win in seven games.	"Perfect opportunity," Frazier said.	Down 3-0, the Mets put runners at the corners with one out in the fourth inning for Frazier. Instantly, he saw the Tigers shift and leave the right side of the infield virtually vacant.	The longtime pro took advantage, pushing a sharp bunt that easily rolled into right field for an RBI single.	"I think it sparked us," Frazier said, adding, "I looked into the dugout, everyone was fired up."	A former All-Star Home Run Derby champ, Frazier has four sacrifice bunts in nine seasons as a big leaguer, but none since 2016.	So how long had he been waiting to pull off this kind of play?	"My whole life, to be honest with you. My whole career," he said.	One out later, Adeiny Hechavarria hit a three-run homer for a 4-3 lead.	Zack Wheeler pitched into the eighth inning as the Mets reached the .500 mark -- they trailed in all but one of these recent victories.	Nicholas Castellanos homered and drove in three runs for the Tigers, who have lost 11 of 12.	Edwin Diaz escaped his own jam in the ninth, striking out John Hicks with runners at first and third, then fanning JaCoby Jones with runners at second and third for his 13th save in 14 chances. Jones hopped up and shouted at plate umpire Jerry Meals after being called out on a 3-2 pitch that appeared a touch outside.	"These guys are playing, they're trying. These are tough losses, but you know what? I've got to believe that they'll come out fighting again tomorrow," Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire said.	"That's what they're doing right now, they're having some fun doing it. It's fun in the dugout. They're into it and that's all you can ask for," he added.	Wheeler (4-3) had retired 13 batters in a row before Jones led off the eighth with a single. Wheeler struck out pinch-hitter Miguel Cabrera and was pulled after walking Niko Goodrum.	Jeurys Familia relieved and Dawel Lugo thought he had struck out, mistaking the count after a swing-and-miss and walking back toward the Detroit dugout. Lugo returned to the plate and fanned for real, and Familia struck out Castellanos to end the inning.	Wheeler also singled twice, boosting his batting average to .308.	Rookie starter Spencer Turnbull (2-4) breezed through the first three innings for Detroit. Dominic Smith opened the fourth with a fly to center field and Jones took an odd route, with the ball falling just beyond his glove for a double.	Wilson Ramos singled to put runners at the corners, bringing up Frazier. Detroit left only first baseman Brandon Dixon on the right side, and he was holding Ramos.	Frazier pounced on Turnbull's first pitch and the ball was placed so well, the slow-footed Ramos cruised into third.	"That was awesome," Mets manager Mickey Callaway said.	ROSTER MOVES	Tigers: Claimed RHP Austin Adams off waivers from Minnesota. He gave up five runs over 2 2/3 innings in two games for the Twins. ... LHP Matt Hall, who had been called up from Triple-A Toledo before the game, was sent back down.	Mets: RHPs Tim Peterson and Paul Sewald cleared waivers and were outrighted to Triple-A Syracuse.	GOTTA HUSTLE	Jones hit a broken-bat popup in front of the mound in the fifth and didn't initially run out of the batter's box. Wheeler had trouble seeing the ball in the sun and dropped it, but had time to throw out Jones.	Gardenhire said he spoke to Jones after the play.	"Got to run the ball out. That's a pretty simple, basic thing is you don't take anything for granted and you run and don't give a chance to get yourself embarrassed. And he did a little bit there and he knows it," Gardenhire said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: Cabrera didn't start for a day of mostly rest.	Mets: OF Michael Conforto was activated from the seven-day concussion list. He went 0 for 3 and was nicked by a pitch. Conforto was hurt May 16 when he collided with teammate Robinson Cano chasing a pop fly.	UP NEXT	Tigers: LHP Daniel Norris (2-2, 4.30 ERA) starts Monday afternoon at Baltimore vs. RHP Gabriel Ynoa (0-1, 5.60).	Mets: Aces meet at Dodger Stadium on Monday when Mets RHP Jacob deGrom (3-5, 3.72) faces LHP Clayton Kershaw (4-0, 3.33).	---	More AP baseball coverage: www.apnews.com/MLB and www.twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

CLEVELAND --  Austin Meadows made sure the Tampa Bay Rays kept flying high Sunday.	Meadows led off the game with a home run and was 4 for 4 with three RBI, leading the Rays over the reeling Cleveland Indians 6-3.	Tampa Bay (31-19) is a season-high 12 games over .500 after taking three of four in the series.	"Being able to set the tone early with the home run first inning was big," Meadows said. "That's kind of what we have been doing all year is getting runs on the board early. We feel good."	The Indians (26-26) fell to .500 for the first time since April 4, when they were 3-3, and trail Minnesota by 10 games in the AL Central. Cleveland has dropped six of seven and finished 4-7 on its longest homestand of the season.	The Indians are struggling in several areas. Their offense is near the bottom in numerous categories in the AL, and the rotation -- thought to be the team's strength -- has been hampered by injuries and subpar performances.	Manager Terry Francona believes there's only one solution to his team's problems.	"Quitting is not an option, man," he said. "You have to keep playing. ... Nobody likes to lose. Guys don't like making outs, guys don't like giving up hits, but you have to play through that. I think that kind of can define who you are at the end of the season is how you fight through frustration."	Cleveland scored twice in the ninth to cut into a 6-1 lead, but Jose Alvarado struck out Oscar Mercado and retired Carlos Santana on a ground ball with two on for his sixth save.	Jalen Beeks (4-0), who took over after Ryne Stanek recorded the first five outs, gave up two hits in 4 2/3 scoreless innings.	Trevor Bauer (4-4) allowed four runs in six innings and hasn't won since April 30.	Meadows got the Rays off to a fast start by driving a 3-1 pitch to center for his 10th homer of the season.	Meadows was hit on the right knee by Bauer's pitch in the fifth but remained in the game and had an RBI single in the seventh. He was credited with an RBI ground-rule double in the ninth when the ball boy seated down the right field line picked up his base hit over first.	Mercado hit his first major league home run in the seventh. The rookie outfielder returned after being out Friday and Saturday. Mercado bruised his right hip after colliding with Leonys Martin while diving for a fly ball Thursday.	Tommy Pham's RBI single and Ji-Man Choi's sacrifice fly added two runs in the third. Pham has a hit in 12 straight games, the longest active streak in the AL.	Rain began falling steadily in the third inning and continued throughout the game.	PUPROSE PITCH?	After his first-inning homer, Meadows scored on Pham's hit in the third and made contact with catcher Kevin Plawecki's glove with his foot as he slid. Meadows said the inside pitch may have been in response to the slide.	"He got me pretty good on the knee, kind of squared me up actually 95 (mph) on the knee," he said. "That's part of the game, but luckily I'm OK."	TOUGH STRETCH	Bauer has given up 15 earned runs, including four homers over 17 innings in his last three starts. He said he's been dealing with issues in his delivery, but thought he showed positive signs Sunday.	"It was just nice to feel like myself physically again," he said. "Feel free with no restrictions and stuff. I'm happy with it. With that part of it. Obviously not happy with the team loss."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rays: RHP Tyler Glasnow (sore forearm) was moved to the 60-day injured list to make room for RHP Oliver Drake on the 40-man roster. Glasnow has been out since May 11. Drake's contract was selected from Triple-A Durham. RHP Casey Sadler was optioned to Durham.	Indians: RHP Mike Clevinger (strained muscle in upper back) will throw to hitters in Arizona on Monday.	UP NEXT	Rays: RHP Yonny Chirinos will serve as Tampa Bay's "opener" for Monday's home game against Toronto.	Indians: RHP Jefry Rodriguez (1-4, 4.08 ERA) will start against Boston at Fenway Park in the opener of a three-game series on Monday.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

WASHINGTON --  Even at age 35 and with a history of hamstring injuries, Howie Kendrick keeps making it tough for his manager to keep him out of the lineup.	Kendrick answered the call again Sunday with three hits and three RBI, including his eighth home run, in Washington's 9-6 victory over the Miami Marlins.	"You want to put him out there every day," Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. "But I've got to make sure that he's rested and he stays healthy throughout the whole year."	Injuries have forced Kendrick into more early action than expected, and without him Washington's struggles so far could've been even worse. After 43 games -- 25 starts -- he's batting .303, sits tied for second on the team in home runs and is third with 28 RBI.	"There's a reason why he's been playing for so long," teammate Anthony Rendon said. "The man is a bulldog out there."	Brian Dozier doubled in two during a four-run rally against Caleb Smith (3-2) with two outs in the third, his final inning.	"I didn't think I had command of any of my pitches," Smith said after his shortest outing this season "They capitalized on it."	Juan Soto drew a key two-out walk in the inning. He added a sacrifice fly in a four-run sixth against Wei-Yin Chen and extended his hitting streak to 10 games with an eighth-inning single.	Michael A. Taylor doubled home a run in the sixth and Rendon added a two-run triple to help the Nationals build a 9-0 cushion. Washington has scored 28 runs while winning three straight in a four-game set that wraps Monday.	The Nationals entered the series on a five-game losing streak.	"It's good knowing that we can string together some wins to get the confidence back in here of knowing we're a really good ballclub," Dozier said.	Erick Fedde (1-0) worked five scoreless innings for his first win since Sept. 11 last year. He made his second start in place of injured Anibal Sanchez.	"I think Fedde doing what he did really got us going," Martinez said. "He came out smoking right from the first inning. And the guys fed off of that."	Miami scored all its runs in the last two innings against Washington's NL-worst bullpen. Neil Walker homered in the eighth and hit an RBI single in the ninth after Brian Anderson's three-run triple chased James Bourque from his big league debut.	"We got some hits there to at least make it look better," Marlins manager Don Mattingly said. "But honestly, it probably wasn't as close as it looked."	HOW THE THIRD INNING TURNED	After Kendrick's solo homer in the second, it was still 1-0 in the third when Soto fought back from an 0-2 hole against Smith to draw a walk and load the bases. Kendrick followed with a two-run single, and Dozier's double off the out-of-town scoreboard knocked in two more.	The rally came after Fedde escaped a bases-loaded jam unscathed in the top half, striking out Walker on a 2-2 curveball.	"Those are the moments when you find out who you are," Fedde said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: OF Garrett Cooper was held out of the starting lineup, but pinch-hit in the ninth inning. "It's just a day for Coop," Mattingly said before the game. "He looked a little beat up yesterday."	Nationals: Martinez said he'd like to see RHP Trevor Rosenthal (viral infection) throw on back-to-back days before making a return to the majors. Rosenthal is scheduled to pitch Monday for Double-A Harrisburg after tossing a scoreless inning Saturday.	UP NEXT	Marlins: RHP Jose Urena (2-6, 4.30 ERA) starts Monday's series finale. He has won three consecutive starts against Washington and has a 2.80 ERA over 45 innings during his last seven outings.	Nationals: Three-time Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer (2-5, 3.41) makes his final start of a frustrating month. He has a 2.53 ERA in five outings in May, but has won only one of his three decisions.	---	More AP baseball coverage: www.apnews.com/MLB and www.twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

PITTSBURGH --  Dodgers manager Dave Roberts' decision to give Justin Turner a breather Saturday paid off nicely.	Not that the Pirates were putting up much of a fight.	Turner had five hits after taking a rest, Joc Pederson homered during a six-run sixth inning that featured consecutive bases-loaded plunkings and Los Angeles beat Pittsburgh 11-7 Sunday to complete a three-game sweep.	Turner had a perfect day at the plate, bouncing back nicely after taking a day to deal with discomfort in his left shin.	"He just does so many things to help us win the ballgame," Roberts said. "I thought he was recharged. His legs were under him today."	Matt Beaty had four RBI and Corey Seager drove in two for the Dodgers, who got five innings of three-run ball from Kenta Maeda (6-2) in his return from the injured list. Los Angeles has won nine of 11.	Chris Archer (1-5) lost his fifth straight start. He allowed six walks and six hits over five innings of four-run ball, striking out just three while throwing 105 pitches.	"Way too many free passes," Archer said. "Playing with fire the whole game and finally it all caught up to me in the fifth inning."	Max Muncy led off the fifth with a 12-pitch walk.	"It was just, go to work," Muncy said. "At that point, you just try to grind out the at-bat and then hopefully force something to happen there. I didn't realize it was 12 pitches, but in the moment, you just kind of focus on trying to get the job done."	The Dodgers scored three runs in the inning to end Archer's day.	"The at-bat that Max put on completely flipped the game," Roberts said. "It stressed (Archer), and you could see he was frustrated. Getting ahead in the count, spoiling pitches. It was four, five, six pitches he spoiled with two strikes. We broke open right there."	Los Angeles poured it on against Montana DuRapau and Dovydas Neverauskas in the sixth. Two batters after Pederson's leadoff homer, Turner singled and went to third on Cody Bellinger's double, then scored on Adam Frazier's error at second base. DuRapau walked Seager, then plunked Kike Hernandez with a 3-2 pitch to put LA ahead 7-3.	Neverauskas relieved and hit Austin Barnes with a bases-loaded pitch while giving up three more runs.	Barnes was injured running the bases and left the game with left groin soreness.	Bryan Reynolds had a two-run homer for Pittsburgh in the second inning, the rookie's fifth. Colin Moran added three hits.	Los Angeles tallied 12 hits and outscored Pittsburgh 28-11 during the series to improve to 6-0 against the Pirates this season.	KELLER COMING	Top pitching prospect Mitch Keller will make his major league debut for the Pittsburgh Pirates in a doubleheader Monday against the Cincinnati Reds.	The 23-year-old Keller is being called upon to help a depleted rotation that has struggled without injured Jameson Taillon and Trevor Williams. He'll start the nightcap after Nick Kingham pitches the opener.	The Pirates have been reluctant to rush Keller to the big leagues. He struggled in spring training but regained some confidence in Triple-A, where he's 5-0 with 47 strikeouts in his last seven starts after adding a slider/cutter to his pitch arsenal.	"In a perfect world, we would've given him some more time," Pirates general manager Neal Huntington said. "We're not in a perfect world. We feel like he's ready to come up here and compete."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: C Francisco Cervelli was placed on the 7-day concussion list. C Jacob Stallings and utility man Jose Osuna were recalled from Triple-A Indianapolis, while utility man Jake Elmore was designated for assignment.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: Return to Los Angeles for a four-game series against the Mets starting with an intriguing matchup between Clayton Kershaw (4-0, 3.33) and Jacob deGrom (3-5, 3.72).	Pirates: Kingham (1-1, 8.76) will pitch the afternoon game followed by Keller's major league debut at night.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

HOUSTON --  Boston Red Sox manager Alex Cora was asked after a 4-1 win over the Astros if he uses the two recent series against Houston as a measuring stick for how good his team is.	"No, I don't," Cora said with a grin. "If I say that, then they've got bragging rights."	Rafael Devers homered off Justin Verlander, and the Red Sox capitalized on two Houston errors to avoid a three-game sweep Sunday.	The banged-up Astros lost for just the fifth time in 22 games and finished the regular season 4-2 against the Red Sox, who beat them 4-1 in the ALCS last season on the way to a World Series championship.	"You see the scores," said Cora, the Astros' bench coach for their 2017 title before heading to Boston. "I know it's early and I know where they're at and I know where we're at. We just both match up well. There are no secrets. It's all execution. There were certain days where we didn't execute, and today, they made some errors and we took advantage of that."	Eduardo Rodriguez (5-3) held Houston to one run and four hits in six innings, improving to 5-1 in his last eight starts.	It was exactly the bounce-back outing he was hoping for after allowing six runs over five innings in a loss to Toronto last time out.	"It feels really good," Rodriguez said. "I've been working these past four days on how I'm going to pitch, the game plan and everything, and it worked pretty good."	Devers' solo shot to center field in the fourth gave the Red Sox a 2-1 lead. It was Devers' seventh homer of the season and fourth in six games.	Boston extended its lead to 3-1 during a sloppy fifth inning for the AL West leaders. A one-out double by Eduardo Nunez was followed by errors from second baseman Yuli Gurriel and third baseman Alex Bregman on back-to-back plays, allowing Nunez to score.	"We didn't play well, and we missed an opportunity to sweep those guys and really just misfired on a day where (Verlander) pitched well enough to keep us in the game and win," Houston manager AJ Hinch said. "I think we allowed ourselves to play a little mentally tired, a little physically tired. We're beat up a little bit, so it wasn't our day."	Verlander (8-2) permitted three runs and six hits in seven innings, striking out six and walking none. He got his 2,800th career strikeout in the fourth against Michael Chavis and finished his day five strikeouts shy of Cy Young's 2,806 for 21st all-time.	Verlander also threw two wild pitches, both in the third inning, after entering with none in 72 1/3 innings this season.	"Against a lineup like that, you've got to limit baserunners, so when they get a couple guys on with infield hits, that makes it really tough," Verlander said. "I was pleased to be able to keep the damage to a minimum but not happy with the results, obviously. We play this game to win, and we weren't able to do that."	Houston went up 1-0 in the first when Aledmys Diaz scored from second on a single by Carlos Correa that deflected off Devers' glove at third base into shallow left field. Christian Vazquez couldn't handle Nunez's bouncing throw to the plate.	After the play, Diaz left the game with left hamstring discomfort. Gurriel moved to second base and Tyler White entered at first.	Hinch said after the game Diaz is likely headed to the injured list.	The Red Sox tied it in the second on a sacrifice fly from Andrew Benintendi that scored Steve Pearce.	Boston added an insurance run to make it 4-1 in the ninth. A walk to Jackie Bradley Jr. was followed by a balk from Framber Valdez, a passed ball and a groundout from Nunez that scored Bradley.	Marcus Walden pitched a scoreless inning for his second major league save and first this season.	ROSTER REPORT	Boston recalled top pitching prospect Darwinzon Hernandez from Double-A Portland and optioned RHP Colten Brewer to Triple-A Pawtucket. Hernandez, a 22-year-old left-hander, made his major league debut April 23 against Detroit, throwing 2 1/3 innings with one walk, four strikeouts and four hits allowed.	ANOTHER CLOSER	Walden's save made him the fifth Red Sox pitcher to earn one this season. Cora said the diversity in the approach to relief pitching without a traditional closer is a testament to the leverage reliever Matt Barnes gives him in often facing the meat of the opposing lineup regardless of the inning.	"It's all because of Barnes," Cora said. "He can do cool stuff, pitching in the eighth and the ninth and the heart of the order. We've got some guys stepping up to help take care of him."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: LHP David Price (illness) could start Tuesday or Wednesday against Cleveland after lasting just three batters and 15 pitches before leaving Saturday's start against Houston. ... INF Brock Holt (shoulder) went through a full workout and will likely be activated and available on Monday against Cleveland.	Astros: C Max Stassi (left knee soreness) was placed on the 10-day injured list. Garrett Stubbs was recalled from Triple-A Round Rock to back up Robinson Chirinos and could make his first major league start Tuesday, Hinch said. ... 2B Jose Altuve (hamstring) was set to start a rehab assignment with Triple-A Round Rock on Sunday night.	UP NEXT	Red Sox: RHP Rick Porcello (3-4, 4.45 ERA) will face the Indians when the Red Sox return home to Fenway Park on Monday. Boston is 6-1 in Porcello's last seven starts. RHP Jefry Rodriguez (1-4, 4.08) goes for Cleveland.	Astros: RHP Gerrit Cole (4-5, 4.11) pitches Monday against the Cubs, looking to improve on his 9-3 career record versus Chicago and add to his MLB-leading 100 strikeouts. LHP Cole Hamels (4-0, 3.38) gets the ball for the Cubs.	---	More AP baseball coverage: www.apnews.com/MLB and www.twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.

MILWAUKEE --  Brandon Woodruff was one pitch away from perfection over eight innings, and he didn't exactly regret the one that went awry.	Woodruff allowed a solo homer but was otherwise perfect before being lifted, Christian Yelich hit his major league-leading 21st home run and the Milwaukee Brewers went deep five times in a 9-1 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Sunday.	Woodruff (7-1) retired his first 15 batters before Andrew Knapp opened the sixth with his first homer on a low changeup.	"He did a good job on it," Woodruff said. "Maybe I could have went with a different pitch, a different selection. But I went in and asked where the pitch was, if it was down, and they said it was down. So, he did a really good job with it. Going back, you always can say you (wish you could) take it back, but at that moment I was convicted with throwing a changeup. So, you just tip your cap."	Ben Gamel had two homers for the Brewers, and Hernan Perez and Yasmani Grandal also went long.	Woodruff struck out a career-high 10, fanning the final batter in each of his innings. Woodruff has won 6 of 8 starts since his only loss on April 10. He also pitched a career-high eight innings in his previous start against Atlanta, making him the first Brewers pitcher with consecutive starts of at least eight innings since Taylor Jungmann in 2015.	"Thank goodness for Knappy," said Bryce Harper, who struck out all three at-bats. "A lot of us thought he had stuff to be perfect today. I thought he went out there and did a good job. Sometimes it's going to be like that."	Woodruff also drove in two with a single and double, raising his average to .370.	Woodruff, who said his only no-hitter was in high school, wanted to pitch the final inning, but manager Craig Counsell opted for Matt Albers, who finished with a perfect ninth.	"I tried to," Woodruff said. "It's a long season. I asked him if I could go back out, and I asked him if he was sure. I pleaded with Craig to try to let me go back out, but I understood the decision."	Yelich opened a four-run fifth with a drive to left off Vince Velasquez. Perez added his fifth homer, and Woodruff capped the inning with an RBI single to put the Brewers up 7-0.	Velasquez, activated off the injured list Friday and moved to the bullpen, allowed four runs, five hits and a walk in two-thirds of an inning.	Gamel hit his third homer to open the third off Zach Eflin (5-5), who allowed three runs and six hits in 3 2/3 innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: Eflin was bothered by a stomach bug before the game. "I woke up fine this morning and about two hours before the game it kind of hit me pretty hard and didn't feel right," he said. "I felt good enough to compete. It had nothing to do with me missing my spots or having bad command."	Brewers: C Manny Pina, on the 10-day IL (right hamstring strain) will not accompany the team to Minnesota as originally planned due to a chance of inclement weather. Pina will remain in Milwaukee, then is expected to begin at rehab assignment at Class A Wisconsin on Tuesday. He could rejoin the Brewers later in the week in Pittsburgh.	HAMMER TIME	Hard-throwing right-hander JD Hammer made his debut with a perfect sixth for the Phillies. Hammer -- a striking figure with big glasses and long, curly hair -- opened the season at Double-A, then made one relief appearance at Triple-A Lehigh Valley before being called up Saturday.	MOUSTAKAS EJECTED	Third baseman Mike Moustakas was ejected in the seventh inning by third base umpire Mike Estabrook, who tossed Ryan Braun and Counsell as the home plate umpire Saturday. Moustakas said he was asking about a checked swing call his previous at-bat.	"I used no profanity, just wanted to have a discussion and see what was going on," Moustakas said. "It was kind of that, and he threw me out of the game."	UP NEXT	Phillies: After a day off Monday, RHP Nick Pivetta (2-1, 8.35 ERA) will be called up from Triple-A Lehigh Valley to make his first start for Philadelphia since April 16.	Brewers: LHP Gio Gonzalez (2-1, 2.39 ERA) opens the two-game series at Minnesota on Monday. Gonzalez is making his sixth start since being signed as a free agent on April 27.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Jake Odorizzi was at 93 pitches, had struck out the last four batters he faced and retired eight in a row when Minnesota Twins manager Rocco Baldelli surprisingly emerged from the dugout to pull his starter one out into the sixth inning.	The pitcher, along with Max Kepler where dealing with an illness. It was hard to tell as Odorizzi dazzled again and Kepler hit a three-run homer an estimated 429 feet into the wall of juniper bushes in center field to help the Twins win 7-0 over the Chicago White Sox on Sunday.	"Sometimes you see some of the best performers play at their best when they're sick," Kepler said. "Michael Jordan, when he was sick in that playoff game. I don't know what it is. Maybe, just calmer. I don't know."	Eddie Rosario hit his 16th home run -- which is second in the American League to Houston's George Springer -- for three runs to cap a four-run third inning against Chicago starter Dylan Covey. Kepler's 12th homer was No. 104 for the Twins, which leads the majors. They also own the top home run differential at plus-43.	Minnesota has won 11 of its past 12 games and swept a series for the seventh time this season. The Twins swept eight series all of last season.	Odorizzi (7-2) allowed one hit in 5 1/3 scoreless innings to win his seventh straight decision, and he finished without allowing a run for the fifth time in his past six starts. He combined with four relievers for Minnesota's sixth shutout of the season.	"It just kind of caught up with me in about the fourth inning on, getting the breathing going and my throat has a little mucus, that sort of thing," Odorizzi said. "I was having trouble just getting a deep breath and then felt like I was choking afterwards because of all the drainage going on. It's been like this way for a few days, so I think I'm on the uphill part of it."	The Twins' surge to the best record in the majors has been powered by the best offense in baseball, but Odorizzi and the team's starters have done their part. Minnesota entered the day with a 3.57 ERA from its starters, the third-best mark in the majors.	"I think their pitching staff is doing a fine job," Chicago manager Rick Renteria said. "Some of the arms they're throwing in the back of the pen right now and in the middle of games, they've got some pretty good arms. They're kind of running hot, but it's a talented group."	Odorizzi has given up three runs in his past 35 2/3 innings for a 0.76 ERA and he's struck out 38 batters over that span. In six starts at home this season, the right-hander has given up five runs in 36 1/3 innings.	He struck out nine batters on Saturday, while the White Sox tied a season high with 16 strikeouts. They were outscored 26-5 in the three-game series.	ONE TOUGH INNING	Covey (0-4) allowed four runs in six innings on three hits and two walks. The only runs he surrendered came in the third, including an RBI double by Kepler over the head of center fielder Charlie Tilson that Tilson misjudged.	"I felt really good today," Covey said. "Just that one inning I just made a mistake to a really good hitter with a man on base and he didn't miss it. Other than that, it was kind of smooth sailing for me."	GET TO KNOW THEM	Minnesota's success didn't translate much to Target Field attendance in the early going, possibly due to unseasonably cool weather. A return home after a strong West Coast road trip coupled with warmer temperatures brought the fans out for the weekend series.	Sunday marked the team's second straight sellout and second since Opening Day. It's the first time Minnesota has had back-to-back sellouts since June 20-21, 2015 against the Chicago Cubs. The crowd of 39,913 was the most at Target Field since Opening Day 2016. The Twins reported walk-up sales of 2,593 on Sunday.	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox: SS Tim Anderson was a late scratch from the lineup for the second straight day as he deals with a laceration on his right hand and right wrist soreness. Anderson was hit in the hand by a pitch on Friday. He said prior to the game that he was ready to go but was later scratched. . OF Leury Garcia was also a late scratch on Sunday due to right shoulder soreness.	UP NEXT	White Sox: RHP Ivan Nova (3-4, 6.96 ERA) starts Monday as Chicago returns home against Kansas City. Nova is 0-2 and has allowed 20 earned runs in 11 innings pitched at home this season. He's coming off a win at Houston when he gave up three runs in seven innings. The Royals counter with RHP Homer Bailey (4-5, 6.13).	Twins: RHP Michael Pineda (4-3, 5.43) draws the start Monday as Minnesota opens a two-game series with Milwaukee, which sends LHP Gio Gonzalez (2-1, 2.39) to the mound. Pineda has won his last two starts and has three quality starts in a row, giving up three runs in each start over that span.	---	For more AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  The Royals have been waiting to catch a few breaks. They got one Sunday.	Whit Merrifield got a fortunate hop on an RBI single in the 10th inning, and the Kansas City Royals beat the New York Yankees 8-7 despite blowing a six-run lead.	"I was saying better lucky than good," Merrifield said. "It just worked out for us today. The hop went our way."	Merrifield hit a sharp, two-out grounder toward third baseman Gio Urshela with speedster Billy Hamilton at second. The ball skipped over the head of Urshela -- considered a strong defender at the hot corner -- giving Hamilton time to race home.	"I just pounded it right in the ground. It was a pretty poor swing, but I'll take it," Merrifield said.	Hamilton had walked against Jonathan Holder (3-2) and stolen second to set up the play.	Hunter Dozier and Jorge Soler homered on back-to-back pitches in the fifth inning and Martin Maldonado and Ryan O'Hearn also went long as Kansas City hit four home runs in a game for the first time this season. All four had multihit games, with Dozier matching a career high with four hits.	New York's Aaron Hicks tied it in the ninth with a two-run single off Ian Kennedy as the Yankees scored three runs, all with two outs, to make it 7-7.	Kevin McCarthy (2-1) threw a scoreless 10th to earn the win.	Kansas City once again hit around Domingo German, who leads the majors with nine wins. German gave up a career-high seven runs on nine hits in five innings.	"This is definitely a bad day for me today," German said through a translator. "I couldn't command my pitches today. I missed on location and that's what happens when you miss on location."	In 11 innings against Kansas City this season, German has given up 10 runs and six homers, taking losses in both games. The 26-year-old has allowed 16 runs and three homers in 49 1/3 innings in his 10 other appearances, nine starts.	"This guy, who's every bit as good as anybody in the league, we've had two really, really good ball games with him and had him in line for another loss today," Royals manager Ned Yost said.	Danny Duffy pitched six innings, allowing four runs, one earned, and five hits. A throwing error by shortstop Adalberto Mondesi extended the Yankees' sixth inning, and Gleyber Torres hit a three-run shot to center two batters later.	"I felt really bad about that. I got to pick up my boys," Duffy said. "I got to do a better job of that and really bearing down when it matters most."	After the Yankees took a 1-0 lead in the second, Maldonado belted a three-run homer in the bottom of the inning. O'Hearn added a solo shot in the fourth.	Nestor Cortes Jr. threw four shutout innings in relief of German.	"Coming into the game, we were down, I knew I had to eat up innings because the bullpen is a little shot and that's exactly what I did," Cortes said.

CHICAGO --  Nick Senzel showed why he is considered one of baseball's top prospects.	If the rookie can provide a consistent presence at the top of Cincinnati's lineup, he could give the last-place Reds a big lift.	Senzel had three hits, scored four times and cut down a runner at the plate, helping Tanner Roark and Cincinnati beat the Chicago Cubs 10-2 on Sunday.	"It makes a difference, especially with what he can do when he's on base," manager David Bell said.	Led by Senzel, the top third of Cincinnati's lineup collected seven of the Reds' season-high 17 hits. Joey Votto singled twice in his third consecutive multihit game, and Eugenio Suarez finished with two hits and three RBI.	"I was not really good the last couple of days, the first two games of the series and the last game in Milwaukee," Senzel said. "I wasn't seeing it very well and I wasn't doing my job as a leadoff man. I just tried to simplify the game -- get on base and let them score me."	The Reds also got five scoreless innings from Roark (4-3) in the rubber game of their weekend set against the NL Central leaders. Cincinnati lost 14 of its previous 19 series against Chicago.	The Cubs were hurt by a shaky performance by Jose Quintana (4-4), and their dreary afternoon got even worse when Kris Bryant departed with an injury after colliding with center fielder Jason Heyward in the sixth inning.	"He's doing OK. He's still under evaluation," manager Joe Maddon said. "We don't know exactly what we're doing with this whole thing yet. But we're trying to talk with the docs and find out exactly where we're at."	With two outs and Senzel on first, Heyward and Bryant converged on Suarez's fly ball toward the gap in right-center. It looked as if Heyward and Bryant both called for it before running into each other , and the ball went off Heyward's glove.	Bryant, a natural third baseman who occasionally plays the outfield, stayed down as Senzel scored and Suarez hustled into third. Maddon and a trainer ran out to take a look, and the 2016 NL MVP gingerly walked off the field after a short conversation.	Maddon said he hadn't watched the replay, but he was told Bryant was hit in the head/neck area. Bryant was cleared to fly with the team to Houston for the start of its six-game road trip.	"We both were going hard to make a play and we ran into each other," Heyward said.	Senzel singled and scored in the first and third innings. He was nearly picked off in the third, but second baseman Daniel Descalso dropped a throw during the rundown. The rookie was shaken up when he collided with David Bote as he got into second, but he stayed in and scampered home on Suarez's sacrifice fly.	The Cubs strung together three consecutive singles with two out in the bottom half of the third, but Senzel threw out Anthony Rizzo when he attempted to score from second on Willson Contreras' liner to center.	Contreras and Javier Baez homered for Chicago. But it wasn't nearly enough on a tough day for Quintana, who allowed five earned runs and a career-high 12 hits in 5 1/3 innings.	Backup catcher Victor Caratini worked the ninth for the Cubs and surrendered Curt Casali's first homer of the season, a two-run drive to left.	HOME STATE FUN	Roark allowed six hits, struck out nine and walked one while improving to 5-1 in seven career appearances at Wrigley Field. The right-hander is from Wilmington, Illinois, about 60 miles south of Chicago, and played college ball at the University of Illinois.	"I love pitching here," Roark said. "The atmosphere is always phenomenal, there's always a sellout and there's family and friends all over."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: 2B Scooter Gennett (right groin) is taking ground balls and swinging the bat. Bell said there is no timetable for his return, but thought it might be two to three weeks before he starts playing in rehab games. "I think it's one of those injuries where when he's good to go, it might be best to take one more week just to be sure," Bell said.	UP NEXT	Reds: RHPs Luis Castillo (5-1, 2.38 ERA) and Sonny Gray (1-4, 3.78 ERA) start Monday in a day-night doubleheader at home against Pittsburgh. Gray is coming off his first win with Cincinnati, pitching six effective innings in a 3-0 victory at Milwaukee.	Cubs: LHP Cole Hamels (4-0, 3.38 ERA) faces Astros RHP Gerrit Cole (4-5, 4.11 ERA) on Monday in the opener of a three-game series at Houston. Hamels pitched a season-low four innings in Wednesday night's 8-4 victory over Philadelphia.	---	Jay Cohen can be reached at https://twitter.com/jcohenap	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

DENVER --  Tony Wolters had three singles but it was his flyout that gave the Colorado Rockies a much-needed victory.	Wolters hit a game-ending sacrifice fly with the bases loaded and Colorado scored twice in the bottom of the ninth inning to rally past the Baltimore Orioles 8-7 on Sunday.	Nolan Arenado homered for the third straight game and pitcher German Marquez tripled and drove in three runs for the Rockies.	"It was an important win. We've got to start winning series and it was a good series win," Arenado said. "It would have hurt losing this series."	It appeared Baltimore would win a series for the first time in a month before Colorado came back in the ninth. The Rockies loaded the bases on two singles and a walk, and Ian Desmond battled Mychal Givens in a nine-pitch plate appearance before drawing a walk to tie it.	"He kept fouling pitches off," Givens said. "I thought I can get him on a 3-2 slider, but he laid off of it."	Wolters jumped on the first pitch and hit a fly to left to score pinch-running pitcher Jeff Hoffman with the winning run.	"I was praying, blowing air at it a little bit," Wolters said. "I knew Hoff was pretty fast. I knew he could get there in time."	Wolters' three hits tied a career high and helped the Rockies take two of three in the interleague series -- a rare Baltimore visit to Coors Field. The major league-worst Orioles (16-37) have dropped eight of nine and haven't won a series since April 22-24 against the White Sox.	"We put ourselves in position and we had the lead and we just didn't get it done," Baltimore manager Brandon Hyde said.	Trey Mancini gave the Orioles a 7-6 lead with a two-run triple in the eighth off winner Scott Oberg (3-0).	Baltimore scored three runs in the seventh and three more in the eighth to rally from a 5-1 deficit.	Arenado's two-run shot gave Colorado a 3-1 lead in the sixth and set the table for Marquez's two-run triple. With two outs, Desmond and Wolters singled and Marquez hit a ball off the wall in right-center against a pulled-in outfield. He trotted into third without a throw for the first triple of his career.	Marquez also was credited with an RBI on a sacrifice bunt in the fifth.	Baltimore strung together five hits in the seventh to get to 5-4. Mancini's error in right field in the bottom of the inning made it 6-4.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Orioles: 1B-OF Chris Davis was placed on the 10-day injured list with left hip inflammation, retroactive to Saturday. The team recalled RHP Evan Phillips from Triple-A Norfolk.	Rockies: OF Charlie Blackmon did some on-field activities but was out of the lineup for the third straight game with a calf strain. Blackmon was removed from Thursday's loss at Pittsburgh after fouling a ball off his calf.	SILVER SLUGGER	Marquez has a hit and an RBI in four straight games and became the 11th Colorado pitcher to hit a triple. He thought he hit it out and had to speed up around second to get to third.	"I thought it was gone but I had to run," he said.	He is hitting .227 this season and has impressed his teammates with his batting style.	"His head barely moves," Arenado said. "It never moves. It looks like he has all this movement but his head never moves. As hitters, you watch that."	CLIMBING THE LIST	Arenado's home run was the 201st of his career and tied him with Dante Bichette for fifth in club history. Arenado hit four home runs in the series, including two on Friday night.	"When Nolan's swinging well he carries the torch," Rockies manager Bud Black said.	UP NEXT	Orioles: RHP Gabriel Ynoa (0-1, 5.60 ERA) is scheduled to make his first start of the season Monday afternoon when Baltimore returns home for a three-game series against Detroit.	Rockies: RHP Jon Gray (4-4, 4.62) gets the start to begin a four-game series against Arizona on Monday.	---	More AP baseball coverage: www.apnews.com/MLB and www.twitter.com/AP-Sports	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

SAN FRANCISCO --  The Arizona Diamondbacks' feel-good weekend ended on a sour note with injury concerns over starting pitcher Luke Weaver.	Ketel Marte homered for the third time in three games, Eduardo Escobar had three hits, and the Arizona Diamondbacks tied a franchise record for scoring in a three-game series as they beat the San Francisco Giants 6-2 Sunday to finish a sweep.	Weaver (4-3) left the game in the sixth inning with right forearm tightness after pitching five-plus innings of six-hit ball. He struck out six and walked two.	Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said the severity of Weaver's injury wasn't immediately known.	"We're going to obviously continue to evaluate him," Lovullo said. "He may be potentially a little banged up right now. If that's the case, it'll be an opportunity for somebody else to step up."	Mike Yastrzemski, the 23-year-old grandson of Hall of Famer Carl Yastrzemski, had the first three hits of his career for the Giants, who lost their fifth straight and finished a 1-6 homestand.	The Diamondbacks outscored the Giants 34-8 in the series, matching a franchise mark they set at home Sept. 12-14, 2016, against Colorado. It eclipsed the previous mark for a three-game road series -- 32 against the Rockies on June 3-5, 2014.	"What we did here in the past three days, scoring as many runs as we did, walking into a venue that's very, very, challenging for a lot of teams to win three games in a row, it's something that will be on my mind," Lovullo said.	Weaver said he left the game for precautionary reasons. He felt the cold weather may have been a factor in the injury. Arizona had a 6-1 lead when he left the game.	"With the conditions, and how the game was shaping up, I just felt like in my best interest going forward, play it safe," Weaver said.	The 25-year-old right-hander said he experienced discomfort throwing his changeup. He felt his mechanics were a bit off.	"I felt like I was rushing, so sometimes you just put your arm in a spot that's just a little bit funky," Weaver said.	Arizona's outburst in this series came after they'd lost five straight and combined for seven runs in their previous four games.	Marte went deep in the first inning off Giants starter Shaun Anderson (0-1). His 12th homer started a two-run inning. Marte was 7 for 15 with three homers, a triple and six RBI in the series and is 9 for 19 over his last four games.	Arizona swept the Giants in San Francisco for the first time since taking a four-game set April 18-21, 2016.	"That's the worst series of the year, I can't remember one where we had three consecutive games with that kind of baseball we just played," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said.	Anderson, making his third major league start, gave up six runs -- four earned -- and nine hits, with a walk and two wild pitches in five innings.	Nick Ahmed sparked a three-run second inning in which the Diamondbacks had three hits and a walk and capitalized on a wild pitch and an error.	Diamondbacks closer Greg Holland notched his ninth save in 10 chances. He came into the game after pinch-hitter Stephen Vogt's one-out double to left off Matt Andriese.	Posey and Joe Panik each had two hits including a double and one RBI for San Francisco.	Yastrzemski, who was called up from Triple-A Sacramento on Saturday, was playing in his second major league game.	"It was better than I could have expected," Yastrzemski said. "Just hoping to put a `W' on there now."	ROSTER MOVES	The Giants recalled RHP Sam Coonrod from Triple-A Sacramento. The 22-year-old pitched a scoreless eighth in his major league debut. LHP Andrew Suarez was optioned to Sacramento, one day after giving up a career-high nine runs -- seven earned.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: 1B Christian Walker was hit by a pitch on his right thumb in the seventh but stayed in the game.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks: RHP Zack Greinke (6-2, 2.89 ERA) will pitch Monday's series opener in Colorado. The five-time All-Star is 4-1 with a 1.49 ERA with 39 strikeouts and five walks over his last seven starts.	Giants: RHP Jeff Samardzija (2-3, 3.27 ERA) will pitch Tuesday's series opener in Miami. The 34-year-old is 5-2 with a 3.62 ERA in 18 games (nine starts) against the Marlins.	--	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

ANAHEIM --  Mike Trout is feeling better in the batter's box than he has all year.	The two-time MVP homered and drove in two runs to help the Los Angeles Angels erase a four-run deficit Sunday in a 7-6 victory over the Texas Rangers.	"At the plate I felt great today," Trout said. "I haven't felt like that all season. Just got to keep doing the same thing and take it into tomorrow."	The Angels have a day game Monday in Oakland. They headed to Northern California on the heels of two comeback wins after a five-game losing streak.	Trout went 2 for 3 with a walk and his 12th home run, tied with Tommy La Stella for the team lead.	"Last few weeks I've just been battling and thinking too much," Trout said. "Today I just went up there and hit it and felt the best. It's a crazy game. ... Just keeping it simple."	Trout hit a solo homer in the first inning to give the Angels an early lead. Later, he and Kole Calhoun scored on wild pitches to cap a six-run seventh.	Shohei Ohtani tied it at 5 with a sacrifice fly off reliever Jeffrey Springs (2-1). Trout and Calhoun then dashed home in consecutive plate appearances, with Trout's run giving the Angels the lead and Calhoun, diving headfirst, extending it to 7-5.	Luis Rengifo contributed to the rally with a two-run single.	With runners at the corners, pinch-hitter Nomar Mazara grounded out against Justin Anderson to end it. Anderson allowed an RBI double to Shin-Soo Choo but earned his first save of the season.	Choo and Hunter Pence each hit a solo homer for Texas. But the bullpen faltered, with Springs allowing four earned runs and Kyle Dowdy one. Springs gave up four hits in the seventh and didn't get an out.	"That falls on me," Rangers manager Chris Woodward said. "Those guys have to get engaged more. We have had a lot of close games where we haven't been able to get those guys in. They are out there competing. Springs did the best he could. I don't expect his command to be perfect. Part of that falls on me, not getting them in there enough."	Andrew Heaney pitched well in his season debut for Los Angeles. Heaney, bothered by elbow inflammation in spring training, struck out 10 and allowed two hits -- both home runs -- in five innings. He threw 85 pitches.	David Fletcher had three hits for the Angels. Luis Garcia (1-1) worked a scoreless inning for the win.	Pence had two hits and two RBI, including a broken-bat RBI double in a three-run sixth that gave Texas a 5-1 lead. Logan Forsythe and Rougned Odor had run-scoring singles.	Rangers starter Ariel Jurado didn't run into much trouble until the seventh. He was charged with two earned runs and six hits in 6 1/3 innings.	Rain started to fall in the second but it was never enough to cause a delay.	HARVEY SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS	After one of the worst starts of his career, Angels right-hander Matt Harvey landed on the injured list with a back strain. He took a couple of days off but said he would resume throwing Monday. He is not expected to get an MRI.	"It's all right. It's getting better," Harvey said. "The last thing I wanted to do was be on the (IL) again. Clearly, it wasn't something I could work through. It was kind of hurting performance. It's something we've got to make sure is better, whether it was 10 days or a little bit longer. It will be something we have to figure out."	Harvey, who gave up eight earned runs and seven hits -- four of which were homers -- in 2 2/3 innings against the Twins, said he didn't tell anyone about his back issue because it was "a little bit me being stubborn and trying to fight through things."	Harvey is 0-1 with a 7.50 ERA.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: OF Justin Upton (turf toe) will accompany the team on its eight-game road trip, but won't be activated. ... C Kevan Smith (seven-day concussion list) was cleared to resume baseball activities.	UP NEXT	Rangers: RHP Lance Lynn (6-3, 4.67 ERA) pitches Monday at Seattle. Lynn had a season-best 11 strikeouts Tuesday against the Mariners. He is 2-0 with a 1.93 ERA in two starts versus Seattle this season.	Angels: Felix Pena was expected to start Monday in Oakland but was used in relief on Sunday, so the Angels had not yet announced a starter.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  Brett Anderson initially looked a little lost covering first base to take a throw from shortstop Marcus Semien on the back end of a 3-6-1 double play, taking several stabs at the bag with his foot.	Like most everything these days for the Oakland Athletics, it ultimately worked out just fine.	Matt Chapman homered for the second consecutive day, Josh Phegley also went deep and had three RBI, and the streaking A's won their ninth straight, beating the Seattle Mariners 7-1 to complete a three-game sweep Sunday.	"We're playing good defense, we're getting timely hits, we're getting good pitching, bullpen, the whole bit," Oakland manager Bob Melvin said. "Everybody's picking each other up a little bit better in the different facets than earlier in the year."	Anderson allowed one run in 6 1/3 innings to win after being forced out of his previous start with a cervical strain. Anderson (6-3) struck out four and walked four, but got the Mariners to hit into double plays in three straight innings.	The first double play was capped by Anderson, even though it took him a few seconds to find the bag with his foot.	"I got over there and didn't really know where the base was," Anderson said. "I felt like I had like a hot foot. I was kind of tap-dancing around the base. Luckily I was able to finally get a foot on it."	The A's streak is their longest of the season but comes with a caveat. Their game against Detroit on May 19 was suspended due to bad weather and won't be resumed until Sept. 6. Oakland has won six consecutive games since the postponement.	Seattle's Jay Bruce hit his 300th career double in the second then hit his 299th homer in the seventh. Bruce needs one more home run to become the eighth active player with 300 doubles and 300 home runs.	The Mariners finished winless on their six-game road trip, the franchise's worst since going 0-7 from July 26-Aug. 1, 2010.	"It was a bad road trip," manager Scott Servais said. "All different games. Some we didn't pitch well, defense not that good, or not getting hits. When that happens you can't put a good game together."	Seattle's frustrations boiled over in the seventh inning when Servais was ejected. Servais had called for a replay after Mark Canha's hard slide into second base upended shortstop J.P. Crawford and prevented a throw to first. Umpires conferred for several moments then went to replay before upholding the call.	Servais came out of the Mariners dugout and argued with crew chief Mike Everitt for several moments before getting tossed. Servais continued to argue until bench coach Manny Acta came out and escorted him off the field.	"Clearly J.P. got taken out on the play," Servais said. "He couldn't finish the play. They thought differently in New York than what I thought. When you argue replay it's not going to go well."	Chapman homered off Mike Leake (3-6) in the first, a liner to right-center. Chapman leads Oakland with 13 home runs.	Phegley homered in the second then added a two-run double in the seventh. Both hits came with two outs. Phegley has six home runs in 41 games this season hitting five in 96 games over the previous two seasons.	"I've been fortunate that guys are on base a lot when I'm up there," Phegley said. "When I get a hit guys are scoring. I tip my cap to the rest of the team for setting the table for me like that."	Leake allowed five runs in 6 2/3 innings. He allowed four hits and retired 13 straight before the A's scored twice in the seventh. Leake has won win in his last nine starts.	FLASHING THE LEATHER	A's second baseman Jurickson Profar sparked one of the A's double plays with a diving stop on Mitch Haniger's liner up the middle in the fifth. From the ground, Profar flipped the ball to shortstop Marcus Semien who threw to first to complete the double play. Profar entered the day leading all second baseman with eight errors.	TRAINERS ROOM	Athletics: Jharel Cotton will make his second rehab start with Single-A Stockton on Tuesday. Cotton is expected to throw 60 pitches. If all goes well, the right-hander will make his next start with Triple-A Las Vegas.	UP NEXT	Mariners: LHP Tommy Milone (0-1, 3.60 ERA) will oppose Lance Lynn (6-3, 4.67) and the Texas Rangers on Monday in Seattle.	Athletics: RHP Chris Bassitt (2-1, 2.48) pitches the opener of a three-game series against the Angels on Monday.	--	More AP MLB:https://apnews.com/tag/MLBandhttps://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

The Atlanta infielder finished a 10-pitch at-bat by singling in the tying run in the ninth inning to kick-start the Braves to a 4-3, 10-inning come-from-behind win over the St. Louis Cardinals on Sunday.	Brian McCann drew a bases-loaded walk off reliever Tyler Webb for the go-ahead run in the 10th.	Albies forced extra innings by fouling off five consecutive 3-2 pitches rom Andrew Miller before ripping a one-out hit to right to tie the score at 3-3.	"The same way he was trying to get me out, I was trying to get my knock," Albies said. "I got the hit, we got the run. It was a huge win for us."	Atlanta, which trailed 3-0 before scoring three in the ninth to tie it, has won 12 of 16 and captured its fifth successive series by winning two of three from St. Louis.	"As he kept fouling off more and more pitches, you could tell his confidence kept growing," Atlanta infielder Freddie Freeman said. "He was throwing everything he had up there and he kept fouling it off. We were feeling pretty good in the dugout."	Braves' infielder Josh Donaldson also saw Albies' confidence growing with each pitch.	"He relished that moment against a guy that's got swing-and-miss stuff," Donaldson said.	The Braves won for only the second time in 19 games when trailing after eight innings.	"We were dead in the weeds for eight innings," Atlanta manager Brian Snitker said. "This is a resilient group. They played 27 outs. This was a good one."	Freeman reached on an infield single with one out and moved to second on a walk to Donaldson and advanced to third on Nick Markakis' fly ball to center field. After Austin Riley was intentionally walked to load the bases, McCann drew a five-pitch walk from Tyler Webb (0-1) that brought in Freeman with the go-ahead run.	Jacob Webb (3-0) picked up the win with a scoreless ninth and Luke Jackson got the last three outs for his seventh save in 11 tries.	Ronald Acuna Jr. had two hits for Atlanta.	The Cardinals have lost four of six and have not won back-to-back games since May 1.	Donaldson and Riley's run-scoring hits in the ninth came off closer Jordan Hicks.	St. Louis starter Jack Flaherty gave up three hits and struck out seven in a 91-pitch outing over six scoreless innings.	The Cardinals scored two unearned runs against Atlanta starter Julio Teheran in the fourth. Kolten Wong reached on a two-base error by Riley, who dropped a line drive in left field. Harrison Bader followed with a run-scoring single to right. He eventually scored on a wild throw to the plate by Donaldson at third.	Yadier Molina pushed the lead to 3-0 with a sacrifice fly in the fifth.	"This one stings a little more than most," St. Louis manager Mike Shildt said. "When you get to that point in the game, we've just got to be able to figure a way to bring it home."	Teheran gave up just two hits and three runs -- one earned -- in five innings. He walked four and struck out one.	Molina suffered a bruise on his right thumb in the fifth inning. He stayed in the game.	"Just a bruise, no damage," Molina said.	ROTATON CHANGE	The Cardinals announced that rookie LHP Genesis Cabrera will start on Wednesday at Philadelphia. He is replacing RHP Michael Wacha, who has been sent to the bullpen. Cabrera was 2/3 with a 6.35 ERA in seven starts at Triple-A Memphis.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Braves: Optioned RHP Chad Sobotka to Triple-A Gwinnett. Sobotka had been on the injured list since April 29 with a left abdominal strain.	UP NEXT	Braves: LHP Max Fried (7-2, 2.88) will start the opener of a two-game set at home against Washington on Tuesday. He will be opposed by RHP Stephen Strasburg (4-3, 3.25). Fried has won his last three starts and allowed five earned runs over 17 innings.	Cardinals: RHP Adam Wainwright (4-4, 4.82) will start against Philadelphia RHP Nick Pivetta (2-1, 8.35) in the first of a three-game series on Tuesday in Philadelphia. Wainwright is 7-2 with a 2.90 ERA in 13 career starts against the Phillies.	---	More AP baseball coverage: www.apnews.com/MLB and www.twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

WASHINGTON --  This time, the Nationals beleaguered bullpen wasn't alone in blowing yet another lead.	Jose Urena pitched seven solid innings, Washington again fell apart late behind ace Max Scherzer and the Miami Marlins beat the Nationals 3-2 Sunday to avoid a four-game sweep.	After Scherzer went six innings and left leading 2-1, Tanner Rainey allowed the tying run in the seventh for the Nationals' 11th blown save, matching the Chicago Cubs for most in the majors.	Kyle Barraclough (1-2) then allowed Miguel Rojas' go-ahead sacrifice fly in the eighth.	The bullpen blues weren't helped by shoddy defense. First baseman Matt Adams dropped Urena's bunt in the seventh trying to apply a tag, and shortstop Trea Turner sailed a ball over Adams in the eighth.	"We (gave up) two unearned runs today," Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. "Those guys came in and threw the ball very well. ... We just didn't make two plays, and it cost us two runs."	The Nationals loaded the bases in the bottom of the inning but could not push the tying run across against the relief duo of Nick Anderson and Adam Conley.	Sergio Romo pitched a scoreless ninth inning for his 10th save, dropping Washington to 22-32.	The Nationals fell to 2-10 in games started by Scherzer, who allowed seven hits and struck out six. He logged six scoreless innings in his previous start against the Mets, but New York rallied against Barraclough and closer Sean Doolittle for a 6-1 victory.	"I was able to pound the zone and throw a ton of strikes," said Scherzer, who also had the go-ahead RBI on Sunday, hitting an RBI single for a 2-1 lead in the fifth inning.	"They did a great job of grinding me and just fouling balls off to run the pitch count up. They just made me work."	The Marlins (16-35) finished 4-3 on their seven-game trip through Detroit and Washington. They swept the Tigers before salvaging one out of four in the nation's capital.	"Jose was good all day, and we were able to scratch some runs in there," Marlins manager Don Mattingly said. "It wasn't easy, but we got enough to get it done."	Conley has not allowed a run in his last five appearances. He came on with two outs in the eighth to face Juan Soto, the Nationals' hottest hitter, and got him to fly out to left and end the threat.	Neil Walker had three hits, including an RBI single in the third to stake Urena to an early lead.	Urena (3-6) allowed two earned runs and four hits to improve to 5-2 against the Nationals, including an earlier win this season.	"It's a random thing. It happens," he said of his success against Washington. "They are a pretty good team. That is the game sometimes. With those hitters, you have to be aggressive because they are aggressive, too."	INSTANT IMPACT	OF Harold Ramirez singled in his first at-bat and has reached safely in 11 of 12 games since making his major league debut on May 11.	SOTO HOT RIGHT NOW	Soto extended his hitting streak to a career-high 11 games with a double to right in the fourth. He is 19 for 41 with 11 RBI during that span.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: OF Garrett Cooper was back in the lineup after getting a day off Sunday. He went 2 for 5 with a double in the third inning.

Manny Machado shakes off the boos he received at Yankee Stadium by saying it happens everywhere. (0:33)	NEW YORK -- Yankees fans drubbed Manny Machado with the same intensity Clint Frazier, Brett Gardner and Gary Sanchez pounded the baseball.	The $300 million infielder was greeted with loud boos and chants of "Over-rated!" on Monday in his first visit to New York since free agency. Machado went 1 for 4 with a too-little, too-late leadoff double in the ninth inning during the Yankees' 5-2 victory over the San Diego Padres, the eighth win in nine games for the AL East leaders.	"You're in New York. I get booed everywhere I go," Machado said. "Great players get booed."	Machado struck out, popped out and hit into a double-play grounder in his first three at-bats, pleasing the Bleacher Creatures. He wouldn't judge whether the salutation was louder than elsewhere.	"How can you compare? A boo's a boo," he said during a sometimes terse 3 1/2-minute postgame media session.	A four-time All-Star with division rival Baltimore before he was dealt to the Los Angeles Dodgers last summer, Machado was interested in playing for the Bronx Bombers after becoming a free agent last fall and dined with Yankees officials in December in hopes of becoming their third baseman. New York did not bite, and Machado signed a $300 million, 10-year contract with the Padres in late February.	New York's third basemen have 30 RBI this year, four more than Machado. Yankees manager Aaron Boone thought the reception was predictable.	"More a tribute to what a good player Manny is," he said.	San Diego became the last opposing team to play at new Yankee Stadium, which opened in 2009, and quickly gained firsthand knowledge of its homer-friendly dimensions	Matt Strahm (2-4) struck out a career-high 10 in six innings but wasted a 2-0 lead in the Yankees' three-run second.	Frazier tied it with his 10th homer, a no-doubt drive over the left-field scoreboard. Gio Urshela walked and Gardner hit a 352-foot fly over the right field short porch, leading Strahm to slam his glove against a thigh in anger. Sanchez added his 16th homer off Craig Stammen in a two-run eighth, an opposite-field shot measured at 353 foot over the short porch.	"I think everybody kind of knows Yankee Stadium, how short right field is," Machado said. "You definitely saw that today with Gary. That was what, 300 feet?"	Short on starting pitching with Luis Severino, James Paxton and CC Sabathia on the injured list, New York used Chad Green as an opener for the third time, and he struck out the side in a perfect first as Machado swung under a slider.	"That's overpowering, dominating Greeny when he's at his best," Boone said. "He set the tone."	David Hale (1-0) allowed RBI doubles by Josh Naylor and Austin Hedges in the second, then started pitching more quickly and retired his last 10 batters for his first win since September 2015 with Colorado.	"It's felt like a while," Hale said.	Adam Ottavino, Tommy Kahnle, Zack Britton and Aroldis Chapman followed with an inning each, combining for three-hit relief in a six-hitter. Chapman got his 15th save in 16 chances.	"It's borderline textbook, six, seven, eight, nine, what they're going to," Padres manager Andy Green said.	San Diego lost its second straight following a five-game winning streak. At 27 the oldest starter in a young rotation, Strahm entered with eight straight outings allowing two runs or fewer. He gave up four hits and three walks.	"I didn't have my changeup but I made the adjustment and finished strong," Strahm said.	SLUGGING	Frazier has four homers and 10 RBI in seven games after getting one RBI in his first 10 games following a sprained ankle. He made a mechanical adjustment after seeing a fan video posted on Instagram by koid24 on Instagram of an at-bat against Boston's Heath Hembree on April 17, even though Frazier took a called third strike.	"Just the swivel of my hand, If you see the circular movement that I'm repeating in the box. I'm trying to have that as done as early as I can before the pitcher comes at me. It helps my pitch recognition somehow," he said. "Kind of just like a `dig-me' video that I saw."	STREAKING	New York is trying to win nine straight series for the first time since 1998. San Diego has lost six straight games in the Bronx dating to 2004.	SEATS	A crowd of 46,254 was just New York's second home sellout.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: INF Fernando Tatis Jr. (strained left hamstring) is hitting at extended spring training, and San Diego will decide in the next few days whether he needs a minor league rehab assignment. ... RF Franmil Reyes returned after missing two games with an injured shoulder sustained on a checked swing Friday. He allowed Cameron Maybin's eighth-inning single to skip off his glove for an error as Gleyber Torres scored.	Yankees: After going 2 for 7 with a home run in two games for Class A Tampa, SS Didi Gregorius is set to move to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on Tuesday as he nears a return from Tommy John surgery. ... Paxton (left knee inflammation) was cleared to pitch and could start Wednesday or Thursday in his first appearance since May 3. ... Sabathia (fluid drained from right knee) could start Sunday's series finale against Boston. ... Severino (right rotator cuff inflammation, strained lat muscle) planned to throw off flat ground Tuesday for the first time since April 6. ... RHP Dellin Betances (right shoulder impingement) threw off a mound for the first time since March 17, a 20-fastball bullpen session.	UP NEXT	RHP Masahiro Tanaka (3-3) has allowed one run or none in three straight starts going into Tuesday's outing for the Yankees against San Diego LHP Eric Lauer (3-4).	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

BALTIMORE --  In a matchup of struggling teams, Baltimore prevailed because of its ability to hit the long ball and its opponent made more mistakes than it did.	It was a welcome change for the Orioles.	Renato Nunez and Jonathan Villar homered, and Baltimore took advantage of several misplays by the skidding Detroit Tigers in a 5-3 victory Monday.	It has been a rocky season for the rebuilding Orioles, who have settled into last place in the AL East by putting together a series of losing streaks. On this occasion, however, Baltimore ran into a team with a similar identity.	Detroit has dropped 12 of 13. In addition to making two errors, one of which led to a pair of unearned runs, the Tigers allowed Hanser Alberto to scoot to second on a grounder up the middle because no one was covering the base.	Detroit also committed a baserunning gaffe: Nicholas Castellanos was doubled off second base in the fifth inning on a fly ball to right field.	"Yeah, we definitely benefited from a couple of their mistakes today," Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. "Teams have benefited from ours. So it was nice to be on the other end."	This wasn't the first time this season that Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire watched his team fumble away a game.	"We gave them runs again. We can't do that," Gardenhire said. "We made a key mistake and it cost us."	The most significant miscue was a throwing error by shortstop Ronny Rodriguez, who was trying to start a double play in the third inning and instead threw the ball into right field. The runner on first came around to score, and Baltimore went up 4-1 when Pedro Severino followed with a sacrifice fly.	Nunez hit a two-run homer off Daniel Norris (2-3) and Villar added a solo shot against Victor Alcantara in the seventh, sending Baltimore to its third win in 14 games.	Despite the victory, the Orioles still own the worst record in the AL at 17-37 and the poorest home mark in the majors at 7-19.	Just two games under .500 on May 12, Detroit is now 19-32.	"Nobody likes losing," Norris said. "We won't lay down. I think the tide is going to turn soon."	After Gabriel Ynoa pitched four innings for Baltimore, Dan Straily (2-4) allowed one run in four innings to earn the win after several poor starts earned him a demotion to the bullpen.	"I've had five days to sit in the bullpen and kind of think about this, do a lot of self-evaluation," the right-hander said. "It's been frustrating. It's been a frustrating month."	Shawn Armstrong got three outs for his first save. Detroit got runners to second and third with two outs in the ninth before Christin Stewart popped out .	TRADE WINDS	The Orioles dealt right-hander Yefry Ramirez to Pittsburgh for a player to be named or cash. Ramirez was designated for assignment by Baltimore last week.	RETURN ENGAGEMENT	Obtained last week in a trade with the Mets, Orioles center fielder Keon Broxton made his Camden Yards debut. It was, however, his second appearance at the stadium.	As a high school senior, Broxton was given a tryout with Baltimore.	"They wanted to see my talent and see what I had," he recalled. "This was the first major league stadium I played in, so it's cool to be able to come back and be on a team."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: SS Jordy Mercer (right quad strain) showed no ill effects after playing five innings at shortstop in a rehab assignment with Triple-A Toledo. "He did fine. He's making progress," Gardenhire said. ... RHP Jordan Zimmermann (right elbow sprain) is scheduled to pitch a simulated game Friday.	Orioles: DH Mark Trumbo has ended a stint in extended spring training and will continue his quest to return from knee surgery by playing for Double-A Bowie on Tuesday. Making an appearance in the Orioles clubhouse Monday, Trumbo said, "My mindset has been that this is a pretty serious deal that's going to require some patience and mental toughness. It's going as well as it can." ... There is no timetable for the return of 1B Chris Davis, who went on the 10-day IL on Monday with a hip injury. "I have no idea. It's pretty sore," Hyde said.	UP NEXT	Tigers: Matthew Boyd (4-4, 3.11 ERA) faces the Orioles on Tuesday night after throwing six shutout innings against Miami on Thursday.	Orioles: Dylan Bundy (2-5, 4.67) has shaved two runs off his ERA in May, and will seek to continue the trend in his second career start against Detroit.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Tampa Bay's plan to use an opener was derailed by recent heavy bullpen use.	Yonny Chirinos showed that fill-in starters, even on a pitch count, can be an excellent replacement.	Chirinos was pulled after five no-hit innings and the Rays went on to beat the Toronto Blue Jays 8-3 on Monday.	"It wasn't (hard) at all," Rays manager Kevin Cash said of taking Chirinos out. "We're going to prioritize the guy's health and be responsible with them."	Chirinos (6-1) made his 11th appearance and fifth start this season. Oliver Drake relieved to begin the sixth and gave up a leadoff single to Luke Maile.	"I don't even think I knew he had a no-hitter until the fans starting booing after Drake gave up a hit," Cash said.	In addition to his starts, Chirinos sometimes comes in after an opener and is averaging five innings an outing. He struck out seven and walked two during a 69-pitch outing, one short of his projected limit.	"I've always been most comfortable as a starter," Chirinos said through a translator. "But this team has confidence in me to come in the (reliever) role and I've just got to prepare accordingly."	Five Rays relievers completed a four-hitter.	Austin Meadows homered and drove in three runs for the Rays, who remain two games behind the AL East-leading New York Yankees despite going a season-high 13 games over .500.	Aaron Sanchez (4-4) gave up one run and six hits before leaving after the third inning because of a problem on the fingernail on his right middle finger. The oft-injured right-hander left his start on May 17 in the fourth inning with a right middle finger blister.	"Hopefully it's nothing too serious," Sanchez said. "Obviously it affected me today. I couldn't really grip the ball, but I don't think it's going to be anything big."	Jonathan Davis hit his first major league homer that got the Blue Jays within 4-2 in the seventh.	Toronto, which has lost 19 of 26, also got a ninth-inning solo homer by Freddy Galvis.	Meadows, who had three hits, had an RBI single in the second and added a two-run homer during a four-run eighth. He has seven hits over his last two games.	Jacob Waguespack made his major league debut after replacing Sanchez and allowed Tommy Pham's RBI double and Ji-Man Choi's run-scoring single during a three-run fourth that made it 4-0.	Choi circled the bases on his hit after catcher Maile's attempt to throw him out trying to advance to second sailed into center field.	Waguespack allowed three runs, three hits and struck out seven in four innings. Plans to have him finish the game were shelved because of shoulder stiffness.	Charlie Montoyo, who was on Cash's coaching staff the previous four seasons, returned to Tropicana Field for the first time as Blue Jays manager.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: Rookie Cavan Biggio is among those impacted by a flu bug working its way around clubhouse and was the DH. 1B Justin Smoak is also ill.	Rays: RHP Tyler Glasnow, 6-1 before straining his right forearm earlier this month, admits he was "frustrated" when moved from the 10- to 60-day IL Sunday. He resumed playing catch but now is not eligible to return until July 10. ... C Mike Zunino (strained left quadriceps) is nearing a rehab assignment. ... INF Joey Wendle (broken right wrist) is hitting off a tee and playing catch at 90 feet.	GOLD GLOVE	Rays CF Kevin Kiermaier took an extra-base hit away from Rowdy Tellez with a leaping catch into the wall in the fourth.	"Another day at the office," Cash said. "You get spoiled because if it stays in the park you think he's going to catch it."	MINOR MATTERS	Rays two-way prospect Brendan McKay is scheduled to make his first pitching start with Triple-A Durham Tuesday night. The lefty went 3-0, striking out 62 and walking nine, over 41 2/3 innings with Double-A Montgomery. He struggled offensively, hitting .167 (13 for 78).	UP NEXT	Blue Jays LHP Clayton Richard (0-0) will make his second start since returning from a knee injury against Tampa Bay opener Ryne Stanek (0-1) Tuesday night.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

CINCINNATI --  After producing five outs in his first four at-bats, Bryan Reynolds was looking for a way to salvage his day.	He found one.	The rookie outfielder hit a tiebreaking two-run triple in Pittsburgh's four-run eighth inning, and the Pirates beat the Cincinnati Reds 8-5 on Monday in the opener of a day-night doubleheader.	Reynolds' one-out liner off David Hernandez (1-3) got into the gap in left-center and drove in Cole Tucker and Adam Frazier. Starling Marte followed with a shot to center for his sixth homer, lifting Pittsburgh to an 8-4 lead.	"A runner on second, late in the game, you want to do something to drive him in," Reynolds said of his first career triple. "It's always nice to mark things off your list."	Hernandez felt he was close to escaping the situation.	"I thought I had Reynolds struck out," Hernandez said. "I didn't get the call. I didn't think he swung, but I thought I caught the bottom of the zone. I haven't looked at it again, but it looked good to me. You still have to make pitches after that. Marte was a flat slider, middle away. If I throw him a good one down and away, it's not a home run."	Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle credited Reynolds with not getting down.	"Toward the end of the day, you could see he wasn't happy with the results with the opportunities he had," Hurdle said. "You show up, and you keep fighting."	Josh Bell also went deep for the Pirates, who snapped a three-game losing streak. Kyle Crick (2-1) got four outs for the win.	Felipe Vazquez replaced Crick with the bases loaded in the eighth and struck out Nick Senzel, ending the inning. Vazquez then worked the ninth for his 14th save, yielding a sacrifice fly to Curt Casali before coaxing Yasiel Puig into a game-ending groundout.	Joey Votto had three hits for Cincinnati in his fourth consecutive multihit game. Eugenio Suarez finished with three hits and two RBI.	Coming off a successful weekend series in Chicago, the Reds grabbed a 3-1 lead in the fifth on consecutive two-out RBI doubles by Senzel, Votto and Suarez, whose drive to center was inches away from being a home run.	But Gregory Polanco hit a tying RBI single in Pittsburgh's two-run sixth, and Bell made it 4-3 when he connected for his 17th homer in the seventh. It was Bell's 11th homer in May, tops in the majors.	Cincinnati right-hander Luis Castillo allowed three runs and six hits in 5 1/3 innings. He struck out four and walked four.	Votto's error on Elias Diaz's potential double-play ball turned into an unearned run in the sixth.	Nick Kingham pitched 4 2/3 innings for Pittsburgh in his third start of the year. He permitted three runs and seven hits.	The doubleheader was created when the Pirates-Reds game on March 30 was rained out.	RIGHT AT HOME	Marte's homer extended his hitting streak at Great American Ball Park to eight games. He is 15 for 40 with four homers in that stretch.	MAKING MOVES	The Pirates brought up right-handers Alex McRae and Richard Rodriguez from Triple-A Indianapolis. They also acquired Yefry Ramirez in a trade with Baltimore for a player to be named or cash, and then assigned him to Indianapolis.	McRae was 0-1 with a 5.68 ERA in two games with Pittsburgh last season. Rodriguez served as the 26th man for the doubleheader.	Right-hander Dovydas Neverauskas was sent down to Indianapolis, and outfielder Corey Dickerson was transferred to the 60-day injured list. Minor league right-hander Jesus Liranzo was designated for assignment.	Dickerson has been out since April 4 with a right shoulder strain.	NO. 26	The Reds added lefty Cody Reed as their 26th player for the doubleheader.	HIT AWAY	Pirates right fielder Melky Cabrera was hit in the right elbow by a Castillo pitch with one out in the fourth inning. Cabrera angrily flung his bat in the direction of the Pittsburgh dugout, but he stayed in the game.	Hernandez plunked Frazier on the right foot with a pitch in the eighth. Frazier stayed in the game.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: LHP Alex Wood has rejoined the team after spending the season at extended spring training in Arizona working out tightness in his lower back. He has started a throwing program that eventually will lead to bullpen sessions, followed by a rehab assignment.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

HOUSTON --  Less than two weeks ago Jack Mayfield flew to Boston because the Houston Astros told him he was going to make his long-awaited major league debut after seven seasons in the minors.	When he arrived, they didn't need him after all after an injury to  Aledmys Diaz wasn't so bad. So and he had to hop on a plane and head right back to Triple-A.	The undrafted free agent got the call again on Sunday night, and on Monday after more than 600 games and 2,500 plate appearances in the minors, Mayfield made his major league debut, getting a hit and driving in a run to help Houston to a 6-5 win over the Chicago Cubs.	"It just delayed my debut," Mayfield said of his jaunt to Boston. "But everything happens for a reason and I got to make it here in Houston, so it was still special."	Manager AJ Hinch beamed when asked about Mayfield's performance Monday.	"It's a long journey for these guys and his story is one to be told because it's improbable and he never thought he'd get the opportunity," he said. "We teased him a little bit last week with almost an opportunity, and I can only imagine the emotions that someone (goes) through."	Gerrit Cole tied a season high with 12 strikeouts in six solid innings and the Astros reached Cole Hamels early and held on for the victory in the opener of an interleague series.	Anthony Rizzo hit a two-run homer in the first inning, but Cole (5-5) dominated after that, allowing two singles and striking out 10 over the next five innings.	Playing without injured stars Jose Altuve and George Springer, and Carlos Correa, who got a day off, the Astros cut the deficit to one in the second and scored five times off Hamels (4-1) in the third to take a 6-2 lead.	Yuli Gurriel had three hits and an RBI and Derek Fisher and Alex Bregman added two hits each as the Astros won for the third time in four games.	Hamels, who had allowed just six runs combined in his last three starts, yielded seven hits and a season-high six runs in four innings for his first loss.	"He wasn't sharp, but this has been going on for about a week -- the ball is just missing our defense by a bounce here or a ball down the line there," manager Joe Maddon said. "But he wasn't sharp and he'll be the first one to admit that. Cole was not typical Cole Hamels."	The Astros sent eight to the plate as they built their lead in the third. Bregman singled before Michael Brantley drew a walk. Houston tied it when Bregman scored on a single by Gurriel. A double by Robinson Chirinos scored Brantley.	Mayfield's RBI groundout made it 4-2 before Tyler White walked. Chirinos and White both advanced a base on a wild pitch by Hamels, which led to the pitcher calling catcher Willson Contreras to the mound for a chat.	But a run-scoring single by Fisher came next and Jake Marisnick pushed the lead to 6-2 with an RBI groundout.	The Cubs got going again at the plate after Cole exited, cutting the lead to 6-3 on an RBI single by David Bote in the seventh to chase Hector Rondon. Will Harris who got out of the inning when White stretched to make a tough catch on a line drive by Kyle Schwarber with two men on base.	Albert Almora Jr., homered off Roberto Osuna to start the ninth. Addison Russell added a solo shot with one out and Bote singled before Osuna struck out Schwarber. He got his 14th save when he struck out Javier Baez to end it.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: The Cubs were without Kris Bryant and Jason Heyward after the two were involved in an outfield collision Sunday against Cincinnati. Maddon said Heyward would likely return on Tuesday but that he doubted that Bryant would play. ... Chicago called up OF Jim Adduci from Triple-A Iowa with Bryant and Heyward both out Monday. ... Reliever Pedro Strop (hamstring) will play a rehabilitation game at Iowa on Tuesday. Maddon said that he might need just one appearance before returning to the roster. ... LHP Mike Montgomery came on to relieve Hamels in the fifth but left without throwing a pitch because of discomfort on his left middle finger.	Astros: 2B Altuve (hamstring) was 1 for 4 in the second game of a rehabilitation assignment with Triple-A Round Rock on Monday. ... Houston placed INF Diaz on the 10-day injured list with a strained left hamstring on Monday and selected the contract of Mayfield to the major league roster.	RIZZO'S MONTH	Rizzo's homer on Monday was his 15th this season and is the earliest he's had that many homers in a season, besting 2017 when he got to 15 on June 14. He has nine home runs and 24 RBI in 21 games this month.	THEY SAID IT	Hinch on Houston's work in the third inning: "We've done that before against Hamels where you look up and it's 70-plus pitches in three innings or into the mid-80s into the fourth inning. That means we're being disciplined."	UP NEXT	Cubs: LHP Jon Lester (3-3, 2.68) is scheduled to start for Chicago on Tuesday night. Lester has a 9.72 ERA in his last two starts after posting a 1.16 ERA in his first seven starts this season.	Astros: Rookie RHP Corbin Martin (1-1, 4.97) will start for Houston. Martin allowed six hits and four runs, three earned, in 3 1/3 innings of a 4-0 loss to the White Sox in his last start.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

CHICAGO --  Yolmer Sanchez provided the closing act in his two-day performance, hitting an RBI single in the ninth inning that sent the Chicago White Sox over the Kansas City Royals 2-1 Tuesday in the resumption of a suspended game.	Getting the field into shape was quite a chore after play was stopped Monday in the bottom of the fifth with a runner on second and two outs following two long rain delays totaling about four hours. The game resumed at 5:40 p.m. EDT, ahead of the regularly scheduled night matchup.	With a handful of fans in the stands, Sanchez came through again in the ninth against Kevin McCarthy (1-2) with the bases loaded.	On Monday, Sanchez hit a tying single in the fifth inning between the breaks.	Sanchez also kept the crowd and his teammates entertained during the delays, doing jumping jacks on the bench. The 26-year-old second baseman also poured a beverage bucket over his head as he stood in the rain, then flapped his arms at third base to make mud angels.	"I've worked so hard in my life to play in the big leagues, I'm going to enjoy it," he said before Tuesday's action. "It's as simple as that."	Sanchez blasted the decision to resume the game Monday night, saying the conditions were "awful" and dangerous. Manager Rick Renteria felt the effects, showing up with a cold he said was brought on by the bad weather.	Jake Diekman (0-2) hit Yonder Alonso leading off the ninth. Kevin McCarthy relieved and James McCann hit a double over right fielder Whit Merrifield's head and Charlie Tilson was intentionally walked to load the bases.	After a forceout at the plate, Sanchez lined a single to center on a 1-0 pitch for his fifth career game-ending hit.	Ivan Nova gave up a run and six hits in five innings. Aaron Bummer worked two scoreless innings. Evan Marshall retired all three batters in the eighth.	Alex Colome (2-0) worked a perfect ninth. The White Sox picked up the win after dropping six of eight.	Hunter Dozier had two hits and an RBI for the Royals. Adalberto Mondesi doubled and scored. Homer Bailey went 4 1/3 innings, allowing three hits and one run. But Kansas City lost for the eighth time in 11 games.	Longtime groundskeeper Roger Bossard and his 24-person crew stayed at the ballpark until about 10:15 p.m.  Monday after 1 3/4" of rain equaling about 112,000 gallons drenched the field. They used 121 bags of quick dry -- about three tons' worth. And Bossard was back at the ballpark at 7:05 a.m.	"I got to tell you, this is my 53rd year here," Bossard said. "And you know what? I've seen a lot of bad weather. Nothing like this year. It's really been amazing."	He also said crew chief Bill Miller made the correct decision to try to continue the game Monday based on the information that was available.	The clubs waited through a 2-hour, 55-minute delay Monday with the White Sox batting in the fifth. The game resumed for only five minutes, long enough for Sanchez to hit an RBI single, before play was halted again. The suspension was announced an hour later.	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox:  SS Tim Anderson (sore right wrist) and OF Leury Garcia (sore right shoulder) entered the game as pinch-runners. Anderson came in to run after Alonso was hit by a pitch, after being held out of the lineup for the third straight game. Garcia, who was held out Sunday and Monday, ran for Eloy Jimenez in the eighth and remained in the game in center field. ... The White Sox placed RHP Ryan Burr (strained right elbow capsule) on the 10-day injured list and recalled RHP Jose Ruiz from Triple-A Charlotte. The team said Burr will be reevaluated in two weeks.	UP NEXT	Royals: RHP Brad Keller (3-5, 4.43 ERA) goes for his second straight win after tossing seven solid innings against St. Louis last week. He was 0-4 in his previous six starts.	White Sox: Coming off a four-hitter for his first major league shutout, RHP Lucas Giolito (6-1, 2.77 ERA) looks to keep his dominant run going Tuesday. He has won four straight starts and is 5-0 with a 1.98 ERA in his past seven outings.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

DENVER --  Raimel Tapia twirled his head to shake the water from his hair.	Turns out, it was Tapia's turn to get soaked in celebration.	Tapia singled in the winning run in the 11th inning to give the Colorado Rockies another dramatic victory, 4-3 over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Monday.	It was Colorado's third walk-off win in four games. The Rockies won two of three over the weekend against Baltimore in their final at-bat.	"You can't discount what we're doing. It's real," manager Bud Black said. "These are good at-bats late in the game."	Ian Desmond set up Tapia's clutch swing with a double that hit the top of the right-field fence and bounced into play. After a quick review to see if it was a homer, Desmond remained at second.	On the next pitch from Matt Andriese (3-3), Tapia hit a grounder through the middle for his second career game-ending RBI. He had barely taken one tiny step out of the batter's box when he lifted his right hand. Then he was doused in water and chalk, which he brushed from his uniform.	"I couldn't be any happier passing it on to Tapia, to get that situation," Desmond said. "This team has a lot of grit. We're grinding."	Tapia also made a diving catch of a sinking liner in the sixth that prevented some runs.	Seunghwan Oh (2-1) earned the win with a 1-2-3 11th inning.	Colorado trailed 3-1 before Nolan Arenado's two-run single off Archie Bradley with two out in the seventh. Arenado is hitting .419 this month.	Just the sort of situation Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo was hoping to avoid.	"You get the wrong guy up in the wrong situation who's very hot right now," Lovullo said. "You're going to suffer and he made us pay."	The Diamondbacks dodged a dicey situation in the 10th after Ryan McMahon and Brendan Rodgers drew walks. Arizona escaped when McMahon was thrown out at third trying to advance on a pitch in the dirt.	Jarrod Dyson led off the 10th with a triple off the glove of Colorado's Ian Desmond, who had just entered in center. Bryan Shaw worked his way around it courtesy of three grounders.	"We're very frustrated," Lovullo said. "We thought we had that game."	The Rockies spoiled a stellar outing for a clean-cut Zack Greinke, who allowed one run and four hits over six innings after ditching his long locks. With Greinke gone, the Rockies capitalized on the bullpen.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: RHP Luke Weaver has a strained forearm, Lovullo said, and will get a second opinion. He was placed on the 10-day injured list before the game. "We're remaining hopeful," Lovullo said.	Rockies: OF Charlie Blackmon was placed on the 10-day injured list with a strained right calf. The move is retroactive to May 24.	IN GOOD STANDING	When asked if Memorial Day provided a good gauge of where a team is in the standings, Black cracked: "The standings always give you a pretty good read of where you are in the standings."	THIS & THAT	Rockies outfielder Yonathan Daza picked up his first major league hit with a blooper to right in the seventh. ... Rockies reliever Jairo Diaz surrendered Ahmed's homer on his 28th birthday. ... Rockies OF David Dahl lined a solo shot to center in the fourth for first homer since May 2. ... SS Nick Ahmed had a solo homer for the Diamondbacks, who were coming off a sweep in San Francisco where they matched a franchise mark for a three-game series by scoring 34 runs.	HOT SPOT	Colorado right-hander Jon Gray had a solid outing in his 100th career start. He went 5 1/3 innings and surrendered two runs before leaving with a hot spot on his middle finger.	"We want to be careful with it," Gray said.	NEED FOR SPEED?	Greinke had his full repertoire of pitches working, especially his off-speed offerings. He struck out McMahon on a 68 mph curve and Tony Wolters on a 66 mph pitch in the second. Greinke has 49 strikeouts on pitches 70 mph or slower since 2018, tops in the major leagues.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks right-hander Merrill Kelly (4-5, 4.75 ERA) will make his first career appearance against Colorado on Tuesday. The Rockies will throw righty Antonio Senzatela (3-4, 6.21 ERA), who is coming off the shortest start of his career. Senzatela allowed eight runs in 3 1/3 innings at Pittsburgh last week.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

BOSTON --  Cleveland reliever Oliver Perez broke a spike loose on his shoe, and three batters later, the Boston Red Sox broke the game open.	Sandy Leon hit a three-run homer off Perez after he caused an odd stoppage asking for new footwear, J.D. Martinez homered twice and the Red Sox beat the Indians 12-5 Monday.	Perez put Fenway Park into a strange delay when he relieved during Boston's six-run fifth inning. The 37-year-old left-hander noticed something amiss with his spikes while warming up and signaled for a replacement pair, leaving him milling about the mound in his socks while a trainer fetched fresh Nike's from the clubhouse.	He said after the game that the toe spike came loose when he was grooming the mound getting ready for the first batter he faced.	"It never happened to me before," he said. "It's kind of funny. It's part of the game."	Boston socked it to him after that. Jackie Bradley Jr. hit an RBI double to make it 6-3 after Perez retired the first batter, and Leon followed with his drive into the Green Monster seats.	"I heard he busted out of `em," said Bradley, who was on-deck. "I've never seen anything like that. I didn't actually see it, still. I was still trying to do my homework on him."	Rafael Devers and Xander Bogaerts had RBI doubles earlier in the inning against starter Jefry Rodriguez (1-5).	Leon, who is known for his defense and calling games behind the plate, came in hitting just .167 with one homer and five RBI.	"He can say all he wants about the defense and calling games, that's what he cares about," Red Sox manager Cora said. "But not really, he wants to contribute offensively and today he did."	Bradley added another RBI double, and Mookie Betts and Bogaerts each had two hits and scored twice for the Red Sox, who have won 18 of 26.	Boston held a moment of silence and showed highlights of former player Bill Buckner, who died Monday. He was 69.	Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia revealed before the game that he will take an indefinite leave in his long struggle to recover from knee trouble, putting in doubt whether he'll play again in the majors.	The Indians have lost seven of eight.	Oscar Mercado had two hits and three runs for Cleveland, but he's also likely to end up on blooper reels from Martinez's first home run. The drive banked off the top of the right field wall, hit Mercado in the glove and then fell into the bullpen.	Boston starter Rick Porcello (4-4) gave up five runs, three earned, on eight hits in 6 2/3 innings.	Cleveland, which won the AL Central the last three seasons, entered the day 10 games behind surprising Minnesota. The Red Sox, who have three straight East crowns, began 6  1/2 behind the first-place Yankees.	Brock Holt's RBI single tied it in the fourth before Boston put up its big fifth.	"They're a good lineup, they started making their adjustments," Cleveland manager Terry Francona said. "Some things happened."	Making his seventh career start, Rodriguez was tagged for seven runs, six earned, in 4 1/3 innings, and dropped his third straight start.	STANLEY CUP FEVER	Chants of "Let's go Bruins!" and "We want the Cup!" broke out late in the game. The Bruins were set to host St. Louis in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Final on Monday night.	NICE GRABS	RF Betts and Indians CF Leonys Martin each made a diving catch.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: Francona said RHP Corey Kluber was with the team because he lives in the area during the offseason and was doing "range of motion" exercises as he works his way back from a broken forearm suffered at the beginning of the month.	Red Sox: Pedroia was transferred from the 10- to 60-day injured list. His surgically repaired left knee has limited him to nine games the last two seasons. "Time will give me the right answer if my knee can do this," he said. ... Holt was activated from the 10-day IL before the game.	UP NEXT	Indians: RHP Zach Plesac will make his major league debut Tuesday.	Red Sox: LHP David Price (2-2, 3.24 ERA) is scheduled to start. He left his previous one Saturday after throwing just 15 pitches due to illness.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

OAKLAND, Calif. --  The Oakland Athletics are riding the long ball to their longest winning streak in 13 years.	Matt Chapman homered for the third straight game, Jurickson Profar and Josh Phegley went deep off former Oakland starter Trevor Cahill, and the Athletics rolled to their 10th straight win, 8-5 over the Los Angeles Angels on Monday.	"We've been playing our kind of baseball," Chapman said. "This season kind of started slow for us. There have been some ups and downs and injuries. ... It just feels good to find ways to win. We haven't let anything get us down and we keep rolling."	Profar tied the game with a two-run homer in the fourth against Cahill (2-5), and Phegley gave the A's the lead for good with a leadoff shot in the fifth. Stephen Piscotty added a two-run single that inning to help Oakland to its first 10-game winning streak since 2006, with a caveat.	The A's had a suspended game in the middle of this streak on May 19 at Detroit. Oakland is leading that game 5-3 in the bottom of the seventh and if the A's hold on and win when it's resumed Sept. 6, the streak will be at 11 games. If the Tigers rally to win, this current streak will officially only be considered a seven-gamer.	"We're just a little bit relentless right now with how we're going about out our business," manager Bob Melvin said. "We're doing some good things right now."	Chapman tacked on a solo shot in the seventh. Robbie Grossman had two doubles and an RBI in support of Chris Bassitt (3-1), who allowed five runs and six hits in five-plus innings.	"People were kind of freaking out about our offense and now it's like, `Here it is," Bassitt said. "We have one of the best offenses in the league. We knew this was coming. It's just a matter of time. It's here, so keep riding the wave."	Albert Pujols hit his 642nd career homer, and Kole Calhoun and David Fletcher each had RBI doubles for the Angels, who have lost six of eight games.	The Angels couldn't get anything done against the A's bullpen as five relievers held them scoreless over the final four innings. Blake Treinen pitched the ninth for his 11th save in 13 chances.	"If the A's have a lead late in the game it's going to be tough to get back in the game," manager Brad Ausmus said. "They run those three guys out there, (Lou) Trivino, (Joakim) Soria, Treinen. You're trying to have a lead through six to keep those guys out of the game because you know it's an uphill battle. Today they did what they normally do when those three come in."	TRAINERS ROOM	Angels: C Jonathan Lucroy was scratched with a stomach virus. ... OF Justin Upton, who has been out all season with turf toe in his left foot, traveled with the team so he could work with the hitting coaches during the road trip. Upton hasn't worked in the outfield yet.	Athletics: C Chris Herrmann (knee) did running drills and is getting closer to being able to start a rehab assignment.	ROUGH START	Cahill allowed six runs and six hits in 4 1/3 innings. He has just one win in his last eight starts with an 8.66 ERA in that span.	"Today I felt like I threw better than six runs," Cahill said. "Just kind of been the story of the season. I just have to figure out how to, when I have my good stuff, to get through it, a good quality outing."	BY THE NUMBERS	Phegley has homered in consecutive games, giving him seven in 42 games this year after having just six in 121 games the previous three seasons combined. ... Piscotty has reached safely in 23 straight games, matching his career best set last year.	UP NEXT	Frankie Montas (6-2, 2.40 ERA) starts the middle game of the series for the A's. The Angels will use an opener before turning the game over to Nick Tropeano, who will be called up from Triple-A Salt Lake to make his 2019 debut.	--	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

MINNEAPOLIS --  The Minnesota Twins have built the best record in the major leagues, fueled by a massive power surge.	Their six-game winning streak was stopped, fittingly, by the Milwaukee Brewers with a big swing from Orlando Arcia.	Arcia drove in three runs, including a go-ahead homer in the eighth inning , before Josh Hader struck out Miguel Sano on three pitches with two runners aboard Monday night to preserve a 5-4 victory for the Brewers.	"I was just trying to find a way to get the runner over, and thankfully I was able to get my hands through and get good contact on the ball," Arcia said through a translator.	The Twins, who fell to 19-7 in May, had a one-run decision for the first time in 11 games. They outscored their opponents 53-16 during their six-game streak.	"Even when you play pretty well, you're not going to win every game, especially when you run into a good, talented team," Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said.	After an RBI single by rookie Luis Arraez and a three-run homer by Byron Buxton , both with two outs in the second inning against Brewers starter Gio Gonzalez, the Twins stopped scoring. Gonzalez settled down and retired the last six batters he faced. Then the bullpen finished with 4 1/3 scoreless innings, scattering three singles.	Jeremy Jeffress, Junior Guerra and Corbin Burnes (1-3) bridged the gap to Hader, who notched his 13th save with a two-inning appearance.	The crowd of 29,167 included at least an even split with Brewers fans, the local contingent likely lessened by an all-day downpour that dampened the Memorial Day holiday and didn't stop until shortly before first pitch.	During a brief return by the rain, Keston Hiura had the first of three straight hits against Michael Pineda in the third, the only hits allowed by the Twins starter in six innings. Arcia doubled to put the Brewers on the board , and Lorenzo Cain and Christian Yelich followed with sacrifice flies to bring them to 4-3.	"When you score three, you feel like, with that long to go in the game, you're essentially tied," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said.	In the eighth, Arcia took Taylor Rogers (1-1) deep for a two-run shot after pinch-hitter Hernan Perez led off with a double, the first homer allowed by Rogers in 17 appearances since April 2.	"Off the bat, I knew it was gone," Rogers said.	Gonzalez failed to finish the fifth for the first time in six starts with the Brewers and gave up a season-most four runs.	"I just want to get past this," he said. "That second inning was a head-scratcher."	LOOK OUT!	Jeffress, who relieved Gonzalez after 102 pitches, ran quite the gauntlet to get the final out of the fifth. After issuing a walk, he was directed by the umpires -- after Baldelli inquired -- to change his pull-off sleeves from light gray to navy blue to match his teammates and comply with baseball's uniform rules. Then after giving up a single, Jeffress snagged a screaming line drive hit by Willians Astudillo with his glove right in front of his face.	Jeffress bent awkwardly backward as he fell with the momentum from making the catch. After lying flat on his back in front of the mound in shock and discomfort, Jeffress walked gingerly off the field on his own after being checked by the team.	"I just reacted. That's all I could do," he said.	GOING, GOING, GONE	The Brewers lead the National League with 90 home runs, buoyed by Yelich's major league-best 21. They're fourth in the majors, with the Twins (105) on top. Buxton's shot to the bullpen behind left-center field matched the Minnesota record for most homers in one month (55), first set in May 1964.	GETTING STRONGER	Pineda, in his comeback season from Tommy John surgery on July 18, 2017, allowed exactly three earned runs in each of his five May starts. He logged 30 innings this month, finishing the sixth in each of his last four turns while lowering his ERA from 6.21 to 5.34.	"I consider this a very positive start. That's a tough lineup," Baldelli said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: Backup catcher Manny Pina (strained right hamstring) went through a workout in Milwaukee and will start a rehab assignment Tuesday with Class A Wisconsin. He has missed the last 10 games.	Twins: Backup catcher Mitch Garver (sprained left ankle) headed out for a rehab assignment with Double-A Pensacola. "I've passed every agility test that they've wanted me to pass. As far as I'm concerned, the training staff is concerned, my ankle is healthy and we're ready to go," Garver said.	UP NEXT	Brewers: RHP Zach Davies (5-0, 2.43 ERA) starts the finale of the two-game series, coming off his worst start of the season. Davies gave up six runs on six hits and one walk over three innings last week in an 11-9 win over Cincinnati.	Twins: LHP Martin Perez (7-1, 2.95 ERA) takes the mound Tuesday night having won six of eight turns with one no-decision since joining the rotation after a bullpen stint when the Twins began the season with four starters. With a victory, Perez would match Houston's Justin Verlander for the second-most in the majors.	---	More AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

CINCINNATI --  Jose Iglesias has been drawing rave reviews all season for his nifty glove work.	He contributed nicely at the plate Monday, too.	The slick-fielding Iglesias hit his first career grand slam off Mitch Keller in the right-hander's major league debut, and the Cincinnati Reds beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 8-1 Monday for a split of their day-night doubleheader.	"Every time you get such a lead, it doesn't hurt," Iglesias said. "I put a good swing on it to put my team in position to win the game. It feels good. I did it with the bat this time."	Iglesias' homer was part of a six-run first. Derek Dietrich and Yasiel Puig added back-to-back homers in the seventh against Alex McRae.	Pittsburgh rallied for an 8-5 victory in the opener, going ahead to stay when Bryan Reynolds hit a tiebreaking two-run triple in the Pirates' four-run eighth inning.	Kyle Crick (2-1) got four outs for the win, and Felipe Vazquez earned his 14th save.	The doubleheader was scheduled after the Pirates-Reds game March 30 was rained out.	Cincinnati jumped all over Keller (0-1). Nick Senzel walked, Jesse Winker singled and Eugenio Suarez walked to load the bases with no outs in the first.	After Dietrich struck out, Puig singled in a run and Iglesias hit a drive to left-center for his fourth homer this season. Senzel also had an RBI single in the inning as the Reds sent 11 batters to the plate while Keller was throwing 41 pitches.	"We knew we had an opportunity in the first inning," Reds manager David Bell said. "The grand slam was huge. Their pitcher settled down and actually did a good job for them."	Keller, one of Pittsburgh's top prospects, allowed seven hits, struck out seven and walked two in four innings.	"The first inning didn't go the way I wanted it to, but I thought I responded well," the 23-year-old said. "The first inning, I was a little amped up and my offspeed pitches weren't as crisp as they were in the second, third and fourth innings."	"He got punched hard early," Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said. "The hole he dug was awful deep. He got better as he went on. He held his poise and stayed aggressive."	Cincinnati's fast start was more than enough support for Sonny Gray (2-4), who pitched six innings of one-run ball. The right-hander struck out seven and walked two in his second straight win.	The doubleheader opener was tied at 4 before Reynolds' one-out liner off David Hernandez (1-3) drove in Cole Tucker and Adam Frazier. Starling Marte followed with a shot to center for his sixth homer, lifting Pittsburgh to an 8-4 lead.	"A runner on second, late in the game, you want to do something to drive him in," Reynolds said of his first career triple. "It's always nice to mark things off your list."	Hernandez felt he was close to escaping the situation.	"I thought I had Reynolds struck out," Hernandez said. "I didn't get the call. I didn't think he swung, but I thought I caught the bottom of the zone."	Josh Bell hit his 17th homer for Pittsburgh in Game 1. He has 11 this month, tops in the majors.	Vazquez replaced Crick with the bases loaded in the eighth and struck out Senzel, ending the inning. Vazquez then worked the ninth, yielding a sacrifice fly to Curt Casali before coaxing Puig into a game-ending groundout.	Joey Votto had three hits for Cincinnati in his fourth consecutive multihit game. Suarez finished with three hits and two RBI in the opener	CLIMBING	Votto's three hits in the opener left him tied with Brandon Phillips for eighth on Cincinnati's career hits list with 1,774. His double left him tied with Johnny Bench for fourth on the franchise's career doubles list with 381.	WORTH NOTING	Cincinnati had lost six in a row against Pittsburgh before taking the nightcap.	MAKING MOVES	The Pirates brought up right-handers McRae and Richard Rodriguez from Triple-A Indianapolis. They also acquired Yefry Ramirez in a trade with Baltimore for a player to be named or cash, and then assigned him to Indianapolis.	McRae pitched three innings in Game 2. Rodriguez worked a scoreless ninth while serving as the 26th man for the doubleheader.	Right-hander Dovydas Neverauskas was sent down to Indianapolis, and outfielder Corey Dickerson was transferred to the 60-day injured list. Minor league right-hander Jesus Liranzo was designated for assignment.	Right-hander Montana DaRapau was optioned to Indianapolis before the nightcap to make room for Keller.	NO. 26	The Reds added lefty Cody Reed as their 26th player for the doubleheader. He tossed two innings in Game 2.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: LHP Alex Wood has rejoined the team after spending the season at extended spring training in Arizona working out tightness in his lower back. He has started a throwing program that eventually will lead to bullpen sessions, followed by a rehab assignment.	UP NEXT	Pirates: RHP Jordan Lyles (5-1, 2.81 ERA) will try to improve to 5-1 in his 16th career game and ninth start against the Reds on Tuesday.	Reds: RHP Lucas Sims will be recalled from Triple-A Louisville to start on Tuesday.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

LOS ANGELES --  Cody Bellinger is not only producing runs for the Los Angeles Dodgers, he's preventing opponents from scoring them.	The slugger hit his 19th homer and threw out two runners from right field, leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 9-5 victory over the New York Mets on Monday night.	"It was a fun day," said Bellinger, who leads the NL with seven outfield assists. "You don't have many opportunities to affect a game from both sides, so when you do it is special."	In a marquee pitching matchup between Cy Young Award winners Jacob deGrom and Clayton Kershaw, the teams combined for 14 runs and 32 hits. Kershaw (5-0) allowed three runs and 10 hits over six innings.	Bellinger's throw to get Carlos Gomez at third and complete a double play in the eighth might be one of the plays of the year. Gomez tagged up when J.D. Davis' bases-loaded fly ball was caught by Bellinger 30 feet in front of the warning track. He fired perfectly on the fly to third baseman Justin Turner, who applied the tag just before Gomez's hand touched the bag -- stopping a run from scoring.	"You're going to see that on highlights for the next 30 years. They're going to be playing that over and over," Mets manager Mickey Callaway said. "They played great defense tonight. When you swing the bats like they do and play great defense, they are going to be tough to beat."	The Mets got four of their first five hitters on base but took themselves out of a big first inning when Michael Conforto was cut down at home on a great throw from Bellinger while trying to score from second on Todd Frazier's single.	Two innings later, Bellinger hit a solo homer off deGrom to put the Dodgers up 2-1.	The Dodgers nailed two runners at home plate and had three outfield assists. The last time they had three outfield assists and a player with two in the same game was Sept. 15, 1993, vs. San Diego. Raul Mondesi had the pair of assists.	"The arm strength is one thing, but the arm accuracy is another. We saved ourselves an inning of baseball with those plays," manager Dave Roberts said.	Chris Taylor and pinch-hitter Kike Hernandez also homered for the Dodgers, who have won 10 of 12. Kenley Jansen entered with the bases loaded and pitched 1 2/3 scoreless innings for his 15th save.	Davis and Adeiny Hechavarria each hit a two-run homer for the Mets, who were coming off a 6-1 homestand.	Los Angeles trailed 3-2 before scoring six runs in the sixth. Taylor tied it with a solo shot off Tyler Bashlor (0-2), and Hernandez gave the Dodgers the lead with a three-run drive to right-center off Daniel Zamora.	Amed Rosario led off the game with a bloop double and scored on Pete Alonso's one-out single.	Joc Pederson began the Dodgers first with the first of three straight singles and tied the game when he came in on Corey Seager's grounder. The run originally didn't count because Seager was ruled out at first to complete a double play, but the call was overturned after a replay review.	After Bellinger's home run, Davis put the Mets back on top 3-2 in the fifth with a two-run drive off Kershaw.	ANOTHER OUTFIELD GEM	Bellinger wasn't the only Dodgers outfielder to make a big defensive play. In the fifth, Tomas Nido was on first when Rosario doubled to left-center. Nido tried to score when the ball went to the wall, but Pederson made a strong throw to Seager, and the shortstop relayed home to catcher Russell Martin for the out.	KERSHAW'S STREAK	The Dodgers have won 16 straight regular-season games started by Kershaw, which ties his career best from two years ago. Los Angeles also won 13 consecutive Kershaw starts in 2014, making him the only pitcher since 1920 with three separate streaks of 13 or more.	Kershaw's record is 9-0 during the current span. The left-hander has gone at least six innings in all eight of his starts this season, but Roberts said Monday's outing was his toughest yet.	"Grind is a good way to describe it," Roberts said. "He didn't have a feel for his mix but he still gave us a quality start."	Kershaw is 9-0 with a 2.14 ERA in 14 regular-season starts against the Mets.	TOUGH OPPONENT	After allowing two runs in five innings, deGrom is 0-4 with a 3.23 ERA in nine regular-season starts against the Dodgers. They are the only team the right-hander has faced in the regular season three times or more and has not defeated. He did beat Kershaw 3-1 in Game 1 of the 2015 NL Division Series, and also won the decisive Game 5 in Los Angeles.	"I didn't have my best stuff tonight but I was able to battle," deGrom said.	GOING EXTRA	Jansen got his first regular-season save of five or more outs since July 4 last year against Pittsburgh. It was his fifth career save of at least 1 2/3 innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: 2B Robinson Cano (quad) is on the road trip and doing some baseball activities. ... LF-INF Jeff McNeil (hamstring) and OF Brandon Nimmo (neck) are back in New York working with the training staff.	Dodgers: C Austin Barnes (groin) was placed on the 10-day injured list. Will Smith was called up from Triple-A Oklahoma City and is expected to be in the lineup Tuesday.	UP NEXT	Mets: LHP Steven Matz (3-3, 3.63 ERA) is still searching for his first win this month. He is 0-2 with a 3.52 ERA in three May starts.	Dodgers: LHP Rich Hill (1-1, 2.67) is 2-0 in five starts against the Mets since joining Los Angeles in 2016.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

SEATTLE --  Daniel Vogelbach provided a preview of what was to come Monday when he launched a batting practice home run into the upper deck in right field at T-Mobile Park.	Batting practice is one thing. Doing it in a game is a rare accomplishment at the 20-year-old stadium.	"He did it in BP, third deck, and then followed it up in the game," Mariners teammate Mallex Smith said. "He's not a 5 o'clock hitter."	Vogelbach's mammoth two-run homer in the seventh inning was the highlight of a 6-2 win over the Texas Rangers that snapped Seattle's six-game losing streak.	Kyle Seager drove in his first run of the season and Smith stole four bases, including three in the eighth -- capped by his second career steal of home. Seattle also got solid pitching from Tommy Milone as the Mariners rebounded after being swept by Texas and Oakland on the road.	But what everyone wanted to talk about was Vogelbach's towering homer off reliever Jose Leclerc that found a rare landing spot, one of the few home runs to reach that part of the stadium.	Everyone except Vogelbach.	"It was just a curveball out over the plate and I was able to ride it out and keep it fair. I was just happy I could drive two runs in," he said.	According to team records through the 2015 season, only two homers had reached that level of the stadium and it was uncertain if any had in the past four seasons. It was Vogelbach's 15th homer of the season and while it was close to being a foul ball, the home run call stood following a replay review.	"For the ball to go over the top of the foul pole like that, that's some kind of special power," Seattle manager Scott Servais said.	Seager, activated off the 60-day injured list last weekend, blooped a single to score Smith in the third when Seattle scored a pair. Smith came through an inning later with a sharp single to score J.P. Crawford.	Milone (1-1) pitched into the sixth. Logan Forsythe missed a home run by inches and settled for an RBI double in the fourth, and Ronald Guzman homered on a 1-2 pitch in the fifth. Those were the only costly mistakes by Milone, who allowed four hits and struck out seven.	Rangers manager Chris Woodward said he thought an early start time and shadows on the field were a factor.	"I think more so for him (Milone) because he is an off-speed guy. He changes speeds, he moves the ball around. Our hitters had a tough time seeing that changeup," Woodward said.	Texas starter Lance Lynn (6-4) struck out 10 and yielded three earned runs in six innings.	"I gave up three runs and we lost, so it doesn't matter how many strikeouts," Lynn said.	SPEED RACER	Smith stole home in the eighth when Kyle Bird tried to pick off Mitch Haniger at first base. Smith stole second and third earlier in the inning and had a stolen base in the third. The four steals were a career high and matched a club record.	Seattle's last steal of home was by Dustin Ackley in 2012.	ROSTER SHUFFLE	Rangers: Texas recalled Bird from Triple-A Nashville and designated RHP Jeanmar Gomez for assignment. Gomez had an 8.22 ERA in 16 relief appearances for the Rangers.	Mariners: Seattle claimed RHP Jimmy Cordero off waivers from Toronto and transferred RHP Gerson Bautista to the 60-day injured list to clear a spot on the 40-man roster. Cordero, 27, was designated for assignment by Toronto last week.	INJURY REPORT	Servais had a long list of injury updates and most of them were positive. Second baseman Dee Gordon was diagnosed with a deep bone bruise in his right wrist and not a fracture after seeing a specialist in Florida. Servais said Gordon's return will likely be determined by how well the wrist can handle swinging and hitting. Gordon said he aggravated the wrist by returning too soon from the initial injury after being hit by a pitch earlier this month.	"I thought I was invincible. I am not," Gordon joked.	Mariners infielder Ryon Healy (lower back inflammation) should resume baseball activities in the next few days.	Seattle pitchers Hunter Strickland (lat) and Felix Hernandez (shoulder) could be throwing off a mound by the end of the week, or early next week. Both have been tossing from beyond 100 feet in recent days, Servais said. Strickland has been out since March 30, and Hernandez has been sidelined since May 12.	UP NEXT	Rangers: RHP Adrian Sampson (2-3) was listed as the starter for Tuesday, although the Rangers plan to use Jesse Chavez (0-1) as an opener. Sampson has followed an opener in each of his past two outings.	Mariners: LHP Marco Gonzales (5-4) hasn't won since April 25 and is 0-4 with a 4.56 ERA in his last five starts.	---	More AP baseball coverage: www.apnews.com/MLB and www.twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

CHICAGO --  Yolmer Sanchez provided the closing act in his two-day performance, hitting an RBI single in the ninth inning that sent the Chicago White Sox over the Kansas City Royals 2-1 Tuesday in the resumption of a suspended game.	Getting the field into shape was quite a chore after play was stopped Monday in the bottom of the fifth with a runner on second and two outs following two long rain delays totaling about four hours. The game resumed at 5:40 p.m. EDT, ahead of the regularly scheduled night matchup.	With a handful of fans in the stands, Sanchez came through again in the ninth against Kevin McCarthy (1-2) with the bases loaded.	On Monday, Sanchez hit a tying single in the fifth inning between the breaks.	Sanchez also kept the crowd and his teammates entertained during the delays, doing jumping jacks on the bench. The 26-year-old second baseman also poured a beverage bucket over his head as he stood in the rain, then flapped his arms at third base to make mud angels.	"I've worked so hard in my life to play in the big leagues, I'm going to enjoy it," he said before Tuesday's action. "It's as simple as that."	Sanchez blasted the decision to resume the game Monday night, saying the conditions were "awful" and dangerous. Manager Rick Renteria felt the effects, showing up with a cold he said was brought on by the bad weather.	Jake Diekman (0-2) hit Yonder Alonso leading off the ninth. Kevin McCarthy relieved and James McCann hit a double over right fielder Whit Merrifield's head and Charlie Tilson was intentionally walked to load the bases.	After a forceout at the plate, Sanchez lined a single to center on a 1-0 pitch for his fifth career game-ending hit.	Ivan Nova gave up a run and six hits in five innings. Aaron Bummer worked two scoreless innings. Evan Marshall retired all three batters in the eighth.	Alex Colome (2-0) worked a perfect ninth. The White Sox picked up the win after dropping six of eight.	Hunter Dozier had two hits and an RBI for the Royals. Adalberto Mondesi doubled and scored. Homer Bailey went 4 1/3 innings, allowing three hits and one run. But Kansas City lost for the eighth time in 11 games.	Longtime groundskeeper Roger Bossard and his 24-person crew stayed at the ballpark until about 10:15 p.m.  Monday after 1 3/4" of rain equaling about 112,000 gallons drenched the field. They used 121 bags of quick dry -- about three tons' worth. And Bossard was back at the ballpark at 7:05 a.m.	"I got to tell you, this is my 53rd year here," Bossard said. "And you know what? I've seen a lot of bad weather. Nothing like this year. It's really been amazing."	He also said crew chief Bill Miller made the correct decision to try to continue the game Monday based on the information that was available.	The clubs waited through a 2-hour, 55-minute delay Monday with the White Sox batting in the fifth. The game resumed for only five minutes, long enough for Sanchez to hit an RBI single, before play was halted again. The suspension was announced an hour later.	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox:  SS Tim Anderson (sore right wrist) and OF Leury Garcia (sore right shoulder) entered the game as pinch-runners. Anderson came in to run after Alonso was hit by a pitch, after being held out of the lineup for the third straight game. Garcia, who was held out Sunday and Monday, ran for Eloy Jimenez in the eighth and remained in the game in center field. ... The White Sox placed RHP Ryan Burr (strained right elbow capsule) on the 10-day injured list and recalled RHP Jose Ruiz from Triple-A Charlotte. The team said Burr will be reevaluated in two weeks.	UP NEXT	Royals: RHP Brad Keller (3-5, 4.43 ERA) goes for his second straight win after tossing seven solid innings against St. Louis last week. He was 0-4 in his previous six starts.	White Sox: Coming off a four-hitter for his first major league shutout, RHP Lucas Giolito (6-1, 2.77 ERA) looks to keep his dominant run going Tuesday. He has won four straight starts and is 5-0 with a 1.98 ERA in his past seven outings.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

NEW YORK --  Sorry, Yankee fans. Padres manager Andy Green didn't want to be out in the rain, either.	Eric Hosmer hit a three-run homer during a big first inning against Masahiro Tanaka, Green burned through his bullpen during a soggy seventh and the Padres held off the New York Yankees 5-4 Tuesday night.	New York tried to rally in the rain, getting three runs in the seventh during a stretch when Green used six pitchers to face eight batters -- not exactly endearing himself to onlookers huddled under ponchos and umbrellas. San Diego escaped the seventh on Gary Sanchez's flyout, Craig Stammen pitched a perfect eighth and former Yankee reliever Kirby Yates closed out the ninth for his 21st save in 21 chances.	Green said seventh-inning setup man Trey Wingenter was unavailable after pitching Monday -- he's still building back up after a stint on the injured list for a right shoulder strain.	"Clearly didn't work out well for us today, so that's what I take the heat for," Green said. "But ultimately, I think we look at that situation and want to see guys rise up and claim that situation. Haven't quite had that since Wing's been banged up."	The game ended when video review overturned a safe call on DJ LeMahieu's grounder, giving the Padres a double play.	"First walk-off on a replay," first baseman Hosmer said with a laugh. "That was nice."	Hosmer's shot came during a four-run first, and Greg Garcia legged out a hit on a perfect safety squeeze in the sixth -- one of two bunt singles for San Diego. Garcia's squeeze followed a successful hit-and--run by Austin Hedges.	Sanchez hit a solo homer in the fourth for the AL East-leading Yankees, who lost for the third time in 15 games. It was Sanchez's 17th homer, one shy of his total from an injury-spoiled 2018.	Eric Lauer (4-4) pitched one-run ball over 5 1/3 innings for San Diego. The Padres stopped a two-game slide that followed a five-game winning streak.	Tanaka (3-4) ended a string of solid starts, giving up five runs in six innings.	"I think a testament to Masa, on a night when he had to search for it a little bit, he was able to navigate through six innings," Yankees manager Aaron Boone said.	Lightning struck nearby shortly after Matt Wisler relieved Lauer and put out a fire in the sixth, and a burst of showers sent fans scrambling for cover during the seventh.	That's when Green opened the bullpen floodgates.	Brad Wieck started the inning for San Diego, walked one and got a strikeout, then handed off to Phil Maton. He walked a batter and was replaced by Robbie Erlin, and Erlin allowed a single to load the bases before Green signaled for Stammen. The last change was met by boos echoing from the Yankee Stadium concourses, where fans hid from the downpour.	LeMahieu greeted Stammen with a two-run single, Voit grounded a single off the third base bag to reload the bases and Hicks made it 5-4 on a fielder's choice before Sanchez cut comeback short with a harmless fly to left.	"I think the walks probably led to some of that decision making," Green said. "You walk leadoff batters, first guys you face, we went into that seventh inning hoping Wieck could just take that inning and run with it.	"Didn't play out well for us, but ultimately got the job done."	Major League Baseball plans to institute a rule change for 2020 mandating that pitchers face at least three batters each or pitch until the end of an inning.	FAMOUS FRIENDS	Japanese pop group Momoiro Clover Z was at Yankee Stadium to watch Tanaka. The Japanese right-hander has walked out to music from the four-woman idol group since coming to the major leagues in 2014. From seats behind San Diego's dugout, the quartet sang and danced along to its own music while Tanaka warmed up.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: Green did not have any update on rookie SS Fernando Tatis Jr., who is hitting in extended spring training as he works back from a strained left hamstring.	Yankees: OF Aaron Judge (left oblique) hit off a tee Monday and is also throwing and running. He hasn't had any issues yet and will continue to ramp up. "Slow, steady progress," Boone said. ... SS Didi Gregorius (Tommy John surgery) was set to play for Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, but the RailRiders' game was postponed amid tornado warnings in the area. ... New York optioned RHP Joe Harvey to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre after the game.	UP NEXT	Yankees LHP James Paxton (3-2, 3.11) will return from the injured list Wednesday to start against breakout Padres rookie Chris Paddack (4-2, 1.93).	---	Follow Jake Seiner: https://twitter.com/Jake-Seiner	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

CINCINNATI -- Derek Dietrich was describing his three-homer game for the media when Scooter Gennett walked past and put it in a slightly different perspective.	"Anybody can hit three, Derek,'' said Gennett, who did him one better in 2017.	No, Dietrich's latest big game didn't set any records. But it extended one of the most unexpected home run tears by a Cincinnati Reds player in recent years. Dietrich hit three homers -- all two-run shots -- and the Pittsburgh Pirates suffered yet another injury to their rotation Tuesday night as Cincinnati pulled away to an 11-6 victory.	"This is more than just a hot streak,'' Reds manager David Bell said.	Dietrich grounded out in his first at-bat and connected in the fourth off Jordan Lyles (5-2), who left after the inning with discomfort in his left hamstring. Dietrich then connected off Geoff Hartlieb in the fifth and again in the seventh for his first three-homer game.	After the third homer, the 13,824 fans at Great American Ball Park demanded a curtain call. Still holding his batting helmet, Dietrich emerged from the dugout and raised both arms.	He didn't get another at-bat to try to match Gennett, who tied the major league record with four homers at Great American Ball Park on June 6, 2017.	Signed to a minor league deal in February with a chance to compete for a spot off the bench, Dietrich has received playing time with Gennett sidelined since spring training due to a groin injury. Dietrich's 17 homers already has set a career high, and 12 of his past 17 hits have been home runs.	It only took Dietrich 118 at-bats to get to 17 homers, the seventh fewest at-bats by a player with 17 homers since 1961, behind luminaries such as Barry Bonds (116), Albert Pujols (112) and Mark McGwire (93).	"They let me be myself,'' Dietrich said. "They believe in me. They gave me an opportunity. That's all I've ever needed along the way.''	Most of the damage has been against the Pirates, who have allowed eight of his homers.	"He's hitting our mistakes extremely well,'' Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said. "The balls are not where we wanted them, and he's clobbered them.''	Lyles had an awkward follow-through on a pitch in the fourth but completed the inning. The Pirates already are missing starters Jameson Taillon and Trevor Williams. They've had 22 players on the injured list this season, with starter Chris Archer also missing time because of a sore thumb.	Now, there's a chance Lyles will have to miss time, as well.	"We've got the injury bug so far this year,'' Lyles said. "Everybody knows it.''	With its seventh loss in nine games, Pittsburgh fell to 26-27, the first time the Pirates have been below .500 since May 3.	Lucas Sims (1-0) was called up pregame and struck out a career-high nine in 7⅓ innings, the longest outing of his career. He gave up Kevin Newman's grand slam in the eighth, the rookie's first major league homer.	The Associated Press contributed to this report.

BALTIMORE --  For the first time in weeks, the Detroit Tigers played the game of baseball the way it's supposed to be performed.	They pitched well. They didn't make an error. Not only that, but the Tigers even added a notch to their AL-low home run total.	Matthew Boyd took a five-hitter into the seventh inning, Niko Goodrum homered and Detroit interrupted a prolonged slump by defeating the Baltimore Orioles 3-0 Tuesday night.	JaCoby Jones had two doubles and an RBI for the Tigers, who won for only the second time in 14 games since May 12.	"Winning is everything. That's all anyone in here cares about," catcher Grayson Greiner said. "It's been a rough stretch. I don't know how many games in a row that I've caught that we lost. It felt really good to get a win."	Boyd (5-4) struck out eight and allowed six hits in six-plus innings . The lefty permitted only two runners to reach second base until he gave up a walk and a single to open the seventh.	That ended his night with Detroit leading 3-0. Buck Farmer and Daniel Stumpf kept the runners in place, Joe Jimenez needed 31 pitches to get out of the eighth and Shane Greene got three straight outs for his 17th save in 18 tries.	"I kind of beat myself at the end, and they did their job," Boyd said. "Buck and Stumpf did a great job of picking me up that inning."	It was Detroit's second shutout of the season, and the fourth time Baltimore has been blanked.	"Just a tough time offensively tonight against a real good starter who's throwing the ball really well right now," Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. "Just had a tough time mustering rallies, and didn't hit many balls hard all night."	The game drew a crowd of 8,106, the seventh time in 27 games the Orioles have attracted fewer than 10,000 fans to Camden Yards. Baltimore has lost 16 of 20 and owns the worst record in the majors (17-38).	Boyd and the Detroit bullpen outpitched Orioles starter Dylan Bundy (2-6), who gave up three runs and seven hits. He struck out eight, the last one giving him 500 for his career.	"I found out about that after the game," Bundy said of No. 500. "That's pretty neat. Definitely a ball I can hold onto and a start that I can keep building on."	Recalled from Triple-A Norfolk earlier in the day, DJ Stewart had three hits and a stolen base for Baltimore.	Detroit went up 1-0 in the first inning when Miguel Cabrera singled in a run , his 69th RBI in 70 career games against Baltimore.	Jones hit a run-scoring double in the second, and Goodrum made it 3-0 in the fifth with his first home run in 23 games since April 30.	ROSTER MOVES	Tigers: RHP Spencer Turnbull was placed on the bereavement list and replaced by INF Jeimer Candelario, who was recalled from Triple-A Toledo. The Tigers also signed RHP Carlos Torres to a minor league contract and assigned him to Toledo. The 36-year-old Torres has 358 major league appearances, most recently with Washington last year.	Orioles: Stewart was summoned from Norfolk after batting .456 with five homers in May. The 25th overall pick in the 2015 draft, Stewart made his major league debut last year, hitting .250 with three homers in 17 games with Baltimore.	MANCINI OR BUS(T)	Hyde is pushing for 1B-OF Trey Mancini (.300, 17 doubles, 10 homers) to make the AL All-Star squad. "I'm on the Trey Mancini for All-Star Game bandwagon. I'm driving the bus," Hyde said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: INF Josh Harrison (left hamstring tendon strain) was placed on the 10-day injured list. Harrison is hitting .176 with a homer and eight RBI in his first season with the Tigers. Detroit recalled OF Victor Reyes from Toledo, where he was hitting .242 with four homers and 30 RBI. ... SS Jordy Mercer (right quad strain) went 1 for 2 with Toledo in his fourth rehab game, leaving after three innings after feeling tightness in his quad. "This is definitely a setback," manager Ron Gardenhire said. "Hopefully it's nothing serious and just fatigue."	Orioles: DH Mark Trumbo (knee surgery) launched his rehab assignment by going 0 for 4 with two strikeouts for Double-A Bowie.	UP NEXT	Tigers: LHP Ryan Carpenter (0-2, 9.00 ERA) makes his fourth start of season Wednesday night, still in search of his second career win. It will be his first appearance against Baltimore.	Orioles: LHP John Means (5-4, 2.96) has allowed three runs over five innings in each of his last two outings after giving up a total of two runs in his previous two starts.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

PHILADELPHIA --  Nick Pivetta has no plans for a return trip to the minors.	Cesar Hernandez hit a go-ahead two-run homer, Pivetta threw five tough innings and the Philadelphia Phillies beat the slumping St. Louis Cardinals 4-3 Tuesday night.	Pivetta (3-1) allowed three runs and three hits, striking out six in his first start since a demotion to Triple-A after posting an 8.35 ERA in his first four starts.	"I think anyone would grow from something like that," Pivetta said of his stint in the minors. "I want to start again in five days and I want to be here the rest of the year."	Paul Goldschmidt and Marcell Ozuna hit homers in the first inning, but the Cardinals wasted a 3-0 lead and lost for the 11th time in 15 games.	"I'm not going to say we're not playing well because we haven't played poorly," Cardinals manager Mike Shildt said. "This group is only getting tighter. Ultimately, it'll be a blessing."	Hernandez gave the NL East-leading Phillies a 4-3 lead in the fourth when he launched his sixth homer of the season off the facing of the second deck in right field.	Cardinals starter Adam Wainwright (4-5) gave up four runs and eight hits in six innings with a season-high 10 strikeouts.	Edgar Garcia got five outs, Seranthony Dominguez retired all four batters he faced and Hector Neris finished for his 10th save in 10 tries.	The Cardinals quickly jumped ahead following a 50-minute rain delay during which Pivetta got soaked jogging in from the bullpen.	Goldschmidt slammed a hanging slider into the left-field seats for his 11th homer. After Paul DeJong was hit by a pitch, Ozuna ripped a two-run shot the opposite way to right for his 15th homer.	"A real gutsy performance in those conditions. Some of those rain drops were big," Phillies manager Gabe Kapler said of Pivetta's outing. "He really showed up when he needed to. He stayed tough."	Pivetta helped himself with a one-out single in the third. Andrew McCutchen also singled and Bryce Harper lined a two-run double with two outs to cut the deficit to 3-2.	Harper hit another double in the fifth, but was thrown out by center fielder Harrison Bader trying to score on Rhys Hoskins' single.	Harper also struck out twice and leads the majors with 75.	"He's relaxed, confident, seeing the ball well," Kapler said. "Those doubles were blistered."	BEEN A WHILE	Wainwright recorded his 10th career double-digit strikeout performance and first since May 25, 2014 at Cincinnati. It was his third career start with no walks and 10 or more strikeouts.	FASTER PACE	Ozuna did not hit his 15th homer until his 120th game last season on Aug. 18.	STREAKING	Neris converted his 13th consecutive save, dating to last season.	ROSTER MOVE	The Phillies recalled OF Nick Williams from Triple-A Lehigh Valley after CF Odubel Herrera was placed on administrative leave by Major League Baseball following his arrest in a domestic violence case at an Atlantic City casino.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: OF Roman Quinn, on the injured list since April 25 with a right groin strain, could start a rehab assignment by the weekend. Kapler said Quinn "looks great, looks strong."	UP NEXT	LHP Genesis Cabrera makes his major league debut for the Cardinals on Wednesday night against Phillies RHP Aaron Nola (5-0, 4.53 ERA). Nola is 3-2, 2.59 in five career starts vs. St. Louis.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

BOSTON --  The Cleveland Indians had plenty to celebrate despite the late hour.	Zach Plesac delivered a solid start in his major league debut and the bottom of Cleveland's lineup led a wild ninth-inning rally as the Indians scored five and beat the Boston Red Sox 7-5 on Tuesday night.	"I was proud of the whole group. We've had a tough, tough week, and they kept on playing and they kept on having energy," Cleveland manager Terry Francona said. "I don't care what time it is. We get to go home with a win."	The Indians didn't score at all until the eighth inning and trailed 5-2 entering the ninth, when Boston's bullpen imploded and Cleveland rallied behind some unlikely sources.	Roberto Perez led off the ninth with a homer off Ryan Brasier and Greg Allen hit a two-run shot to tie it at 5-all. Jordan Luplow added a two-run double to give Cleveland its first lead and Brad Hand survived a bit of a shaky ninth for his 14th save, completing a rare come-from-behind win for the Indians on a rough night for relievers.	Plesac pitched 5 1/3 innings, holding Boston to one run on four hits after being interrupted by a one hour and nine minute rain delay in the middle of the second inning.	"I thought he accounted for himself really well," Francona said. "There was a lot thrown at him. He's making his debut at Fenway. It's raining. He doesn't know if we're going to start on time, then there's a delay. . He wasn't scared. He didn't back down from anybody."	Nick Wittgren (2-0) got the win despite allowing two runs on three hits in the eighth, his only inning.	Ryan Brasier blew a save opportunity and a 5-2 lead in the ninth. Perez started the rally with a leadoff homer to center, Jake Bauers walked and Allen -- who was hitting .091 entering the game -- homered to right and tied it at 5-all.	"No excuse right there," Brasier said. "A three-run lead, it should be in and out but I made a few bad pitches and they made me pay for it."	Boston wasn't quite done imploding. Travis Lakins (0-1) took over for Brasier and hit Mike Freeman with a pitch and loaded the bases with a pair of walks, before Luplow hit a drive deep to right that bounced off the top of Mookie Betts' glove at the wall.	Luplow said Allen's homer, his first of the season and fourth of his career, was what really put Cleveland over the top.	"He was due for something big. He's been swinging the bat well since he came back, and he finally got his," Luplow said. "It's big for us. It shows that we fight for every out and every at-bat, every pitch."	The wild ending spoiled strong starts by Boston's David Price and Plesac, who carried a shutout into the sixth inning of his major league debut.	Price allowed only three hits and struck out six in six innings.	NICE JOB, KID	Plesac threw 86 pitches and got a round of pats on the back from his teammates and Francona on the mound after Rafael Devers' triple with one out in the sixth.	Xander Bogaerts followed with a single up the middle and Plesac appeared on the hook for a loss until the ninth.	Plesac, called up from Triple-A Columbus earlier in the day, said he stayed warm during the delay by riding a stationary bike in the clubhouse, helping keep his mind occupied, too.	"I was just trying to stay slow motion and kind of play it by ear," Plesac said. "I didn't know when the tarp was coming off, didn't know what the rain looked like. I just stayed loose, stayed ready and was ready for game time."	HIGHER GROUND	The light rain that fell in the first picked up and the grounds crew replaced the tarp over the infield after the top of the second. The PA system chimed in with "Gimme Shelter" by the Rolling Stones as poncho-clad fans scrambled for cover in the concourse. The game was delayed one hour and nine minutes by rain.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: Optioned LHP Josh Smith to Triple-A Columbus to clear roster space for Plesac. . RHP Danny Salazar (shoulder surgery) threw live batting practice Tuesday in Goodyear, Ariz. . RHP Mike Clevinger (shoulder) is scheduled to throw a simulated game Saturday in Goodyear. ... OF Tyler Naquin (left calf strain) continued a rehab assignment with Triple-A Columbus.

UP NEXT	Indians: RHP Shane Bieber (3-2, 3.11 ERA) gets the start in the series finale, which was moved up to a 6 p.m. start to alleviate some of the congestion with the Bruins hosting the St. Louis Blues in Game 2 of the Stanley Cup Finals. Bieber has 25 strikeouts in his last two starts.	Red Sox: RHP Ryan Weber (1-0, 1.29) picked up his first career victory as a starter Thursday at Toronto, holding the Blue Jays to one run on three hits in six innings.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  The Tampa Bay Rays keep winning -- and drawing sparse crowds at home.	Austin Meadows homered for the third straight game and five Tampa Bay relievers combined to throw a six-hitter and beat struggling AL East rival Toronto 3-1 on Tuesday night.	The second-place Rays have won fourth straight, improving to a season-best 14 games over .500 before an announced crowd of just 5,786 -- smallest ever for a Rays home game at Tropicana Field.	"I noticed it during the anthem, and I was like: `Oh it's still early, maybe people will still file in," opener Ryne Stanek said after Tampa Bay's sixth win in seven games moved them within one game of the division-leading New York Yankees.	"It's tough, especially when we're playing well and we're playing a fun brand of baseball that's fun to watch," Stanek added. "We don't play boring baseball. We don't play sloppy."	The Rays, who routinely rank at or near the bottom of the major leagues in attendance, began the night averaging an AL-worst 14,578 per game.	There have been only two smaller crowds for big league games played in the domed stadium -- both in 2017, when Hurricane Harvey forced relocation of a Rangers-Astros series from Houston and attracted 3,485 on Aug. 29, 6,123 on Aug. 30 and 3,385 on Aug. 31.	Meadows hit his 12th homer of the season, a solo shot to right field off reliever Thomas Pannone in the seventh inning. He also homered Sunday at Cleveland, as well as Monday during an 8-3 victory over Toronto and has nine hits and seven RBI in the past three games.	Avisail Garcia had an inside-the-park homer off Clayton Richard (0-1) in the third and also scored on a first-inning sacrifice fly.	Meanwhile, the Rays bullpen -- beginning with opener Ryne Stanek -- limited the Blue Jays to four singles and a pair of doubles.	Ryan Yarbrough (4-1) pitched 3 2/3 innings for the win, working out of a jam after Justin Smoak singled and Rowdy Tellez doubled to begin the Toronto fourth. Chaz Roe, Emilio Pagan and Diego Castillo, who yielded two hits and Brandon Drury's sacrifice fly in the ninth inning, finished up.	The Blue Jays have dropped six of seven and fell to 0-8-1 in their series against Tampa Bay, dating to August 2017.	The Rays used an opener for the 17th time this season. Stanek has made 15 of those starts, holding opponents scoreless in 13 of those outings.	Yarbrough, meanwhile, continued to prosper in what's become his customary role of following an opener. The 27-year-old left-hander led major league rookies with 16 victories last season, 14 of them as a reliever.	Richard, acquired from San Diego in an offseason trade, made his second start for Toronto after beginning the season on the injured list (right knee). He allowed two runs, three hits and four walks over four innings -- the biggest blow Garcia's routine fly that dropped behind right fielder Randal Grichuk and rolled to the wall.	Garcia, who singled in the first and scored on Travis d'Arnaud's sacrifice fly, circled the bases for the first inside-the-park homer of his career.	"He said that he got disorientated," Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said of Grichuk, who broke in on the ball before realizing it was going to land well behind him.	"He was looking up, looking up and then he was like, it was weird," the manager added. "He felt bad about it, too."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: RHP Aaron Sanchez, who left Monday's series opener with a finger injury, will throw a side session Thursday or Friday before a decision is made on whether he'll go on the injured list or remain in the rotation. ... A flu bug has affected several Blue Jays the past week, including INF Cavan Biggio, who was not in the lineup Tuesday.	Rays: C Mike Zunino (left quadriceps strain) started a rehab assignment with Class A Charlotte and will have his status evaluated this weekend. ... INF Matt Duffy, out all season with a strained left hamstring, will see a specialist Wednesday. ... INF Yandy Diaz still felt some discomfort in his bruised left hand during his first batting practice session. He plans to hit again Wednesday.	MCKAY'S DAY	Rays two-way prospect Brendan McKay allowed three hits and struck out four over five scoreless innings in his first start with Triple-A Durham against Louisville. The lefty went 3-0 in eight games, striking out 62 and walking nine over 41 2/3 innings with Double-A Montgomery. He struggled offensively at Double-A, hitting .167 (13 for 78).	UP NEXT	Reigning AL Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell (3-4, 3.07 ERA), who's received a combined two runs of support over his last three outings, starts the finale of the three-game series Wednesday night.

MIAMI --  Runs were tough to come by for the Miami Marlins until their recent turnaround, and now they're scoring several at a time.	Jorge Alfaro and Garrett Cooper hit Miami's first three-run homers of the year Tuesday in an 11-3 win over the San Francisco Giants, who lost their sixth game in a row.	Trevor Richards (2-5) gave up a homer to Joe Panik on the game's first pitch but blanked San Francisco thereafter. He allowed two hits and one run in seven innings for the Marlins, who earned their eighth victory in 11 games but still have the worst record in the National League.	The Marlins are last in the majors in runs, doubles, homers, walks, slugging and OPS. But the offense has been much improved lately.	"You're not hitting three-run homers if guys don't get on base," manager Don Mattingly said. His team totaled 14 hits against four San Francisco pitchers.	It was another dismal all-around effort by the Giants (21-32), who have been outscored 45-11 in the past four games and are 11 games below .500 for the first time.	"You can't get off to a better start -- your leadoff hitter hits the first pitch out of the ballpark," manager Bruce Bochy said. "You think momentum is going to swing over and get the bats going, but it's just the opposite."	Meanwhile, Miami kept adding on. Alfaro hit his eighth homer in the fifth to make the score 7-1, and Cooper added his third homer in the sixth.	When asked about the three-run homer as a weapon, Mattingly smiled. The Marlins had none in their first 51 games.	"I don't mind it," Mattingly said. "We just don't use it enough, right? It's good to see. They change the game quick."	Starlin Castro's two-out, two-run double in the third put Miami ahead to stay. Rookie Harold Ramirez had three hits to hike his average to .413 in 13 games.	"Sometimes I don't believe I'm here," Ramirez said. "But my mother and my wife told me believe it."	Pinch hitter Rosell Herrera hit his first homer of the year in the eighth to make the score 11-1.	Jeff Samardzija (2-4) lost his third start in a row. He allowed a season-high five earns runs in four-plus innings, matching his shortest outing of the year.	"Obviously everyone's aware of what's going," Samardzija said. "As a starting pitcher, you get that one day, you're chomping at the bit to get out there and throw up a bunch of zeroes and get a big win. Unfortunately it didn't roll that way today."	The Marlins' first seven runs scored with two out. They went 5 for 13 with runners in scoring position.	Miami improved to 10-4 against the Giants since 2017.	GOPHER BALLS	Alfaro hit a 1-2 fastball from Nick Vincent for his homer. Cooper homered on an 0-2 knuckle curve from Derek Holland.	"Ahead in the count ... that's just poor concentration and execution," Bochy said. "There's no excuses for that."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Giants: Vincent (right pec) will go on the injured list, Bochy said. The right-hander left the game in the sixth inning accompanied by a trainer. ... RHP Trevor Gott (strained forearm) will soon throw a bullpen and is expected to be activated next week.	Marlins: RHP Riley Ferrell (sore lat) has been sidelined while on a rehab assignment.	UP NEXT	Giants: LHP Madison Bumgarner (3-4. 4.10), who will start the second game of the series Wednesday, has 70 strikeouts and only 13 walks this season. He's 2-0 in five starts in May.	Marlins: RHP Pablo Lopez (3-5, 5.40) will start against the Giants for the first time. He is 2-1 with a 1.93 ERA in four home starts this year.	---	Follow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve-Wine	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

ATLANTA --  The Washington Nationals are in obvious need of a momentum-changing win as they approach the end of May. Much closer to last place than first in the NL East.	Adam Eaton hopes overpowering performances by Stephen Strasburg and closer Sean Doolittle will start that turnaround.	Strasburg matched his season high with 11 strikeouts in seven innings and the Nationals took the lead on three straight walks to beat the Atlanta Braves 5-4 on Tuesday night.	"It was a great team win, something we can build on," said Eaton, who drew the first of back-to-back, bases-loaded walks in Washington's three-run sixth.	Howie Kendrick had three hits, including his ninth homer , and scored two runs for Washington. Trea Turner also had three hits.	Braves rookie Austin Riley's two-run homer off Kyle Barraclough in the eighth cut Washington's lead to 5-4. Riley had three hits. His sixth homer in his 13th game cleared the center field wall.	Doolittle protected the one-run lead in the ninth for his 10th save in 12 chances. Dansby Swanson singled with two outs before Doolittle struck out Freddie Freeman . It was his third strikeout of the inning and 16th of the game by Washington pitchers.	"A great win," Eaton said. "We needed that bad. I'm pretty fired up about it."	Strasburg (5-3) gave up an RBI single to Nick Markakis in Atlanta's two-run fourth but otherwise faced no trouble. He struck out two Atlanta batters in each of the first three innings and gave up only five hits and two runs.	"Stephen Strasburg set the tone," said Washington manager Dave Martinez. "Another great outing by him. He was awesome."	Atlanta led 2-1 through five innings before back-to-back doubles by Kendrick and Kurt Suzuki to open the sixth tied the game.	Max Fried (7-3) hit Victor Robles with a pitch and issued two walks in Washington's three-run sixth. Fried, who gave up four runs in 5 1/3 innings, left the game after walking Eaton with the bases loaded, giving the Nationals a 3-2 lead.	Anthony Swarzak, making his Atlanta debut after he was acquired from Seattle on May 20, walked Anthony Rendon to force in another run.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: RHP Anibal Sanchez will come off the 10-day injured list to start Wednesday night. Sanchez is returning from a left hamstring injury. He has had no setbacks and was confirmed as the starter following the game. Martinez waited until a final update on Sanchez, who tested the hamstring by running on Tuesday, before officially announcing plans for the second game of the series.	Braves: There is no word on when OF Ender Inciarte will start baseball activities in his rehab from a lumbar strain. Inciarte was placed on the 10-day IL on May 15 and has missed 13 games.	PICKOFF ARTIST	Fried's pickoff move produced two outs. Fried threw to second to pick off Turner in the first. After Eaton was grazed by a pitch from Fried in the fifth, the left-hander's pickoff to first fooled Eaton, who reacted too late. "For a team like Washington that likes to run, I felt he did a very good job of controlling their running game," said Braves third baseman Josh Donaldson.	STREAKING	Juan Soto led off the fourth with a single up the middle for a 12-game hitting streak. Soto advanced to second on Suzuki's single and scored on a two-out single by Robles. Rendon had three walks and has reached base in 15 consecutive games.	FINALLY WE MEET	It was the season's first meeting of the NL East rivals. This was the latest the teams have opened their season series since 2005 -- the Nationals' first year. "It seems like we've played the Mets every other day," Martinez said. "It's kind of weird."	UP NEXT	Nationals: Sanchez (0-6, 5.10) will look for his first win in his 10th start of the season. He is 5-11 with a 4.99 ERA in 18 career starts against the Braves.	Braves: LHP Kevin Gausman (2-3, 4.33) is 4-1 with a 4.41 ERA in six career starts against Washington.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.
