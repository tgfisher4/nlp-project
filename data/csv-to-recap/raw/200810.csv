PHILADELPHIA --  Brett Myers stood on first base, shaking his head and shrugging his shoulders. He couldn't explain his hitting success, and no one ever expected it.	Myers did better at the plate than on the mound, going 3-for-3 with three RBIs, and Shane Victorino drove in four runs as the Philadelphia Phillies overcame another homer by Manny Ramirez to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 8-5 Friday for a 2-0 lead in the NL championship series.	"I'm not a very good hitter," said Myers, who became the first pitcher to get three hits in an NLCS game. "I just get lucky occasionally. I'm baffled by it. I would've rather pitched better."	A grieving Charlie Manuel was in the dugout with the Phillies, hours after the manager's mother died. Players and coaches from both teams offered condolences before the game. Manuel didn't speak to reporters.	"I know Charlie told me he talked to his mom on a regular basis and her only concern was for him to go out and win ballgames," Dodgers manager Joe Torre said.	The Phillies rallied around their skipper, and now they'll have to do the same for their spark-plug center fielder. Victorino was told after the game that his grandmother died Friday morning.	Victorino hopes to attend the funeral in Hawaii without missing any games. No arrangements had been made yet, but Tuesday is a scheduled off day in the series.	Victorino made a clutch catch with two on to end the seventh, and Brad Lidge hung on in the ninth for his second save of the series. He walked Ramirez and James Loney, then struck out Matt Kemp and Nomar Garciaparra to end it.	"We really wanted to win today for Charlie," Lidge said.	The series shifts to Los Angeles for Game 3 on Sunday night, with 45-year-old Jamie Moyer pitching for Philadelphia against Hiroki Kuroda.	The Phillies said Manuel would travel with the team for Game 3 and was expected to attend Saturday's workouts in Los Angeles.	Myers wasn't sharp on the mound, allowing five runs and six hits in five innings. Good thing for the Phillies that he's suddenly become a pesky batter after hitting .069 with one RBI in the regular season.	In Game 2 against Milwaukee in the first round of the playoffs, Myers drew a two-out walk from CC Sabathia and Victorino hit a grand slam two batters later in a 5-2 win.	"He had four hits all year and three today. That's tough to count on and defend against," Torre said.	Myers was surprised, too. At one point, he stood in the dugout, covered his eyes with one hand and feigned a swing with the other, showing a teammate how he did it.	The Phillies, appearing in their first NLCS in 15 years, are two wins from the World Series. They've won just one championship (1980) in the franchise's 126 years.	"We're not comfortable until we're finished with this whole thing," Myers said. "We're going to keep fighting."	A title-starved crowd waved its "Fightin' Phils" rally towels and chanted "Beat LA!" These long-suffering fans haven't celebrated a championship since the NBA's 76ers won it all in 1983. If the Phillies keep playing like this, they just might give them that parade down Broad Street in a few weeks.	Ramirez did his best to spoil the party.	After grinning when a pitch from Myers sailed behind his back in the first inning, he lined a three-run shot into the flower bed just beyond the left-field wall to pull the Dodgers to 8-5 in the fourth.	Ramirez has hit a record 27 homers in the postseason. His 71 RBIs are second only to Bernie Williams' 80.	"I'd want to have a guy like that on my team," Ramirez said of Myers. "He's going to go out there and battle."	Myers left after tossing a scoreless fifth, and four relievers kept the Dodgers off the scoreboard the last four innings. Chad Durbin, J.C. Romero and Ryan Madson combined for nine outs.	Lidge finished for his fourth postseason save and his 45th in 45 chances this year.	Dodgers starter Chad Billingsley allowed eight runs -- seven earned -- and eight hits in 2 1/3 innings. The 24-year-old right-hander pitched 6 2/3 strong innings in a win over the Cubs in Game 2 of the division series.	Myers had a go-ahead RBI single with two outs in a four-run second inning, and his two-run single chased Billingsley in the third. Myers was 4-for-58 in the regular season and is a lifetime .116 hitter.	"It's crazy," he said.	Billingsley struck out four of the first six batters he faced, but quickly ran into trouble after fanning Pat Burrell and Jayson Werth in the second.	Greg Dobbs hit a soft single up the middle and scored when Carlos Ruiz hit a double to left-center. Myers lined the next pitch to right-center to drive in Ruiz and give the Phillies a 2-1 lead.	Jimmy Rollins bounced a single up the middle and Myers chugged toward third. Kemp misplayed the ball in center field or he could've thrown Myers out to end the inning. Rollins hustled into second on the play.	Victorino followed with a two-run single to left-center to make it 4-1. The Flyin' Hawaiian slapped his hands after rounding first and the fans went wild.	Victorino made a leaping catch of Casey Blake's drive at the center-field fence to end the seventh.	"He hit it well," Victorino said. "I just told myself, try to get back."	Loney's two-out RBI single to center cut it to 4-2 in the third. The Dodgers loaded the bases when Kemp reached on third baseman Dobbs' fielding error, but Myers escaped the jam by striking out Blake DeWitt on a slow curve.	Pumped up by his pitching, Myers came through at the plate again. The Phillies loaded the bases with no outs. After Ruiz's grounder forced Burrell at home, Myers slapped a liner past first baseman Loney down the right-field line to give the Phillies a 6-2 lead.	Chan Ho Park came in and struck out Rollins, but Victorino tripled to right-center to make it 8-2. Los Angeles used two more pitchers to get out of the inning.	Before he rattled Billingsley, Myers unnerved some of the Dodgers' hitters. He threw some high-and-tight fastballs in the first inning and the one really wild pitch that sailed behind Ramirez.	Myers knocked down Russell Martin with a fastball right before he struck out on a slow curve. That brought up Ramirez with two outs and nobody on.	Myers' first pitch was in and the next one, a 94 mph fastball, was several feet behind the Ramirez. Never shy to tell a pitcher he doesn't appreciate getting brushed back, Ramirez didn't say a word and ended up striking out on a 3-2 slider.	As he walked to the dugout, Myers had some words with Dodgers first-base coach Mariano Duncan.	"He said, 'You're going to get somebody hurt out here,' " Myers said. "The ball slipped out of my hand. I don't want to hurt their best player."	Game notes	 Hall of Fame pitcher Sandy Koufax sat one row in front of Hall of Fame manager Tommy Lasorda behind the Dodgers dugout. Lasorda got a nice ovation when he walked up the steps during the fourth inning. ... Ramirez struck out and popped out his first two at-bats and was 3-for-21 off Myers before he connected.	Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Daisuke Matsuzaka's brilliant escape act bewildered Tampa Bay and put the Boston Red Sox on top in the AL championship series.	Matsuzaka took a no-hit bid into the seventh inning and worked out of trouble all game, pitching the defending World Series champions past the Rays 2-0 Friday night in the ALCS opener.	Dice-K wiggled out of trouble in the first and seventh, then got help from his bullpen to rebuff one more threat in the eighth as the Red Sox taught the young Rays about dominant postseason pitching.	"It's amazing. We always joke how he gets out of these innings," Boston's Kevin Youkilis said. "He'll have bases-loaded, nobody out; or first and third, nobody out, and he gets out of jams. We wish he wouldn't put himself in those jams, but it's amazing how he does it and shows how great of a pitcher he is."	Jed Lowrie snapped a scoreless tie in the fifth with a sacrifice fly against James Shields, and Youkilis drove home another run with a seventh-inning double off left fielder Carl Crawford's glove as the playoff-savvy Red Sox beat baseball's best home team on its own turf.	Jonathan Papelbon closed out Boston's team-record sixth straight postseason road win. Now the upstart Rays, who held off the Red Sox for the AL East title, are the ones doing the chasing.	Game 2 is Saturday night at Tropicana Field, with Josh Beckett pitching for Boston against All-Star Scott Kazmir.	"This is probably how it's going to be," Youkilis said. "It's going to be a battle every game."	Crawford singled leading off the seventh for Tampa Bay's first hit and raced to third when Cliff Floyd followed with a single. But Dice-K, who was unbeaten on the road this season, was equal to the task.	Dioner Navarro flied to shallow left, Matsuzaka fanned Gabe Gross for the last of his nine strikeouts and Jason Bartlett grounded into a force play to end the threat.	"You have to tip your cap to Dice-K and the way he got out of jams," Shields said. "He was the better man tonight."	The Rays, who thrived on timely hitting in winning a franchise-record 97 games this season, missed another opportunity in the eighth after Matsuzaka, who allowed four hits in seven-plus innings, gave up two more singles.	Hideki Okajima relieved and Carlos Pena flied out on a 3-0 pitch. Justin Masterson took over and got All-Star rookie Evan Longoria to ground into a double play.	"Listen, it happens," Rays manager Joe Maddon said. "When you're facing very good pitching at this time of the year, they can stifle you even with nobody out. We can do the same thing to them."	Papelbon pitched the ninth for Boston, extending his career postseason scoreless streak to a major league-record 20 2-3 innings over 13 appearances. Joe Niekro held the old mark of 20 scoreless innings.	The Rays finished 1-for-7 with runners in scoring position. They wasted a big chance in the first, too, after Matsuzaka walked the bases loaded.	"He doesn't give in," Boston manager Terry Francona said. "He throws all his pitches, so hitters have to respect, even in tight situations, he doesn't become a one-pitch pitcher."	Much was made before the best-of-seven series about previous scuffles between the teams, a history both sides tried to play down. But the opener did turn a bit testy in the eighth when Grant Balfour hit J.D. Drew in the right shoulder with a high fastball, prompting a few Red Sox to holler from the bench.	Jason Bay drew a leadoff walk in the fifth and went to third when Mark Kotsay doubled down the left-field line for the third hit off Shields, who also started Game 1 for Tampa Bay in its first-round playoff series against the Chicago White Sox.	Lowrie, who drove in the winning run with a ninth-inning single in Boston's division series-clinching victory over the Los Angeles Angels, followed with a sacrifice fly.	Shields avoided further damage when Jason Varitek grounded to second and Jacoby Ellsbury popped to shortstop Bartlett, who made an over-the-head catch in shallow center field.	"I'm not discouraged in any way," Maddon said. "We played well, and we just have to hit better tomorrow, that's it."	The Rays breezed into the ALCS by beating the White Sox in their first-ever playoff series, while the Red Sox are playing for the pennant for the fourth time in six years after beating the Angels in the other ALDS.	With fans clanging cowbells and standing and cheering every strike, Shields fanned Ellsbury to start the game, then quickly slipped into a tight spot when Dustin Pedroia walked on a 3-2 pitch and Youkilis hit a drive to right that landed just inside the line and bounced over a short fence in foul territory for a ground-rule double.	Pedroia, who would have scored easily if the ball had not gone into the stands, rounded third and headed home where plate umpire Tim McClelland waited a few feet up the line. Shields escaped by striking out Drew.	Matsuzaka, 18-3 overall, also got off to a shaky start, walking leadoff man Akinori Iwamura and two of the next four batters to load the bases with two outs.	Opponents were hitless in 14 at-bats against the right-hander with the bases loaded during the regular season, and he got out of another jam by retiring Floyd.	"He just missed on a few pitches," Varitek said of the rocky first. "He did settle into his rhythm and found his arm slot more."	Tampa Bay won the season series between the AL East rivals 10-8, including eight of nine at Tropicana Field.	The Red Sox were 7-2 against the Rays at Fenway Park. Both of Tampa Bay's victories there came during a 10-day, confidence-building stretch in which the Rays took four of six from the World Series champions to hang onto first place.	Floyd, one of veterans brought in last winter to provide leadership in Tampa Bay's clubhouse, expects the talented Rays to rebound.	"We've come back from much worse situations than this," he said. "That's a good team. You've got to make sure that you capitalize when you have chances. When you don't, you're going to settle into an unfortunate situation like this."	Game notes	 Boston hasn't lost on the road in the postseason since losing at Cleveland in Game 4 of the 2007 ALCS. ... Since becoming the second player in major league history to homer in his first two playoff at-bats, Longoria is 2-for-14 with eight strikeouts. One of those hits also came in Tampa Bay's Game 1 victory over Chicago in the ALDS. ... Youkilis was 0-for-17 lifetime against Shields before his first-inning double.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  B.J. Upton and the Tampa Bay Rays won a game of home run derby with a shallow fly ball.	Pinch-runner Fernando Perez dashed home on Upton's sacrifice fly in the 11th inning and the Rays outlasted the Boston Red Sox 9-8 early Sunday, evening the AL championship series at one game each.	The teams combined for seven home runs, tying a postseason record. The Rays wound up winning a game that lasted 5 hours, 27 minutes when the speedy Perez tagged up on Upton's one-out fly and beat right fielder J.D. Drew's throw home.	"Like I said, in a straight-up race, I've got him over Seabiscuit," Rays manager Joe Maddon said. "I'm dating myself a bit. I'm sorry, but that's the first horse that came to my mind."	The series shifts to Fenway Park for Game 3 Monday, with left-hander Jon Lester pitching for Boston against Matt Garza.	"We did not want to go to Boston down 0-2," said Evan Longoria, who homered for Tampa Bay. "It's 1:30 in the morning and we pulled it out."	Dustin Pedroia homered twice for Boston, and scored his fourth run on a wild pitch in the eighth that made it 8-all.	Red Sox reliever Mike Timlin walked Dioner Navarro and Ben Zobrist to begin the 11th and Jason Bartlett grounded out, moving runners to second and third, and Akinori Iwamura was intentionally walked.	Upton, who had homered earlier, followed with his fly ball down the right-field line.	"The main thing there is not to strike out," Upton said.	Drew settled under the ball, but rushed and a two-hop throw up the third-base line. Perez scored easily, showing off his best asset -- he stole 43 bases in Triple-A this season, and went 5-for-5 on steal tries with Tampa Bay.	Another rookie, David Price, earned the win. He entered with a runner on first and one out in the 11th and walked Drew, but struck out Mark Kotsay and retired Coco Crisp on a grounder.	"It's been like that all year, someone stepping up," Longoria said. "There's different heroes every day."	Jonathan Papelbon pitched 1 2/3 scoreless innings, getting the defending World Series champion Red Sox to the 11th. He extended his career postseason scoreless streak to a major league-record 22 innings over 14 appearances, despite getting struck by Carl Crawford's liner.	Cliff Floyd, Longoria and Upton homered for Tampa Bay off struggling Josh Beckett. The wild-card Red Sox homered three times in the fifth inning, with Pedroia and Kevin Youkilis connecting off Scott Kazmir and Jason Bay tagging Grant Balfour.	"It's very frustrating any time you get eight runs for you and you can't win the game," Beckett said.	After Boston won the ALCS opener 2-0, the teams came out swinging for the fences. All seven homers came in the first five innings.	The Red Sox and Ray matched the postseason record for homers set in the 1989 World Series and tied in the NLCS in 2003 and 2006.	Down 8-6, the Red Sox rallied within a run in the sixth on an RBI single by Bay.	Pedroia led off the eighth with a single against Chad Bradford and reliever Trever Miller walked David Ortiz.	Dan Wheeler took over and got Youkilis to ground into a double play. With Bay at the plate, Wheeler threw a pitch over the glove of Navarro that went to the backstop. The All-Star catcher retrieved the carom, but made an off-target, underhand toss to Wheeler covering the plate that allowed Pedroia to score.	Boston threatened again in the ninth when Crisp hit a two-out double that sailed over Upton's head in center field. Wheeler struck out Jacoby Ellsbury to end the inning.	Longoria, the All-Star rookie who homered twice in his playoff debut against the Chicago White Sox, snapped an 0-for-13 drought with a two-run homer in the first inning. Upton launched a solo shot in the third and Floyd homered in the fourth for Tampa Bay.	After Pedroia, Youkilis and Bay homered to put the Red Sox ahead 6-5 in the fifth, the Rays answered with three runs in the bottom half off Beckett, who allowed eight runs and nine hits in 4 1/3 innings. A year after becoming the first Red Sox pitcher to win four games in the same postseason, the big right-hander has struggled through the two shortest playoff starts of his career. He allowed four runs on nine hits in five innings against the Los Angeles Angels in Game 3 of the ALDS.	"We wanted Beckett to get through that fifth and set up our bullpen, and it didn't work," Boston manager Terry Francona said.	Carlos Pena's RBI single and Longoria's run-scoring double finished the Boston starter. Crawford's single on reliever Javier Lopez's first pitch drove in Longoria to make it 8-6.	Bay, also had a two-run double in the first, was 3-for-5 with four RBIs for the Red Sox. Youkilis also had three hits and has now hit safely all nine of his career ALCS games.	Despite having their team-record six-game postseason road winning streak snapped, the Red Sox were happy to be returning to Fenway Park with the series tied 1-all.	"Why not?" Ortiz said. "Return to the house. Good things happen over there."	Game notes	 Kazmir allowed five runs and six hits in 4 1/3 innings. ... Youkilis' hitting streak in the ALCS is the longest to start a career since Darin Erstad hit safely in his first nine games for the Angels from 2002-05. ... Pedroia was 2-for-21 in the postseason before homering off Kazmir in the third and fifth innings. Including playoffs, he's 16-for-28 with three home runs lifetime against the Rays ace. ... The Red Sox also hit three home runs in an inning at Cleveland in Game 4 of last year's ALCS.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

LOS ANGELES --  Manny Ramirez and the Los Angeles Dodgers were tired of getting brushed back in the NL Championship Series, so they came out ready to fight back against Philadelphia.	Blake DeWitt's bases-loaded triple off Jamie Moyer capped a five-run first inning, and the feisty Dodgers beat the Phillies 7-2 in a testy game Sunday night to trim Philadelphia's lead to 2-1 in the best-of-seven series.	The benches and bullpens emptied in the third inning, moments after Los Angeles starter Hiroki Kuroda threw a pitch over Shane Victorino's head, with an angry Ramirez barking at the Phillies during the fracas.	But there were no punches or ejections, and the Dodgers played with poise all night.	"We just want to play the game right," Ramirez said. "We're a team and we need to protect each other. I wasn't trying to get anybody. I was there just in case anything happened. I just wanted to go out there and protect my teammates. I don't fight nobody. I'm a lover."	Kuroda pitched effectively into the seventh for the Dodgers, who will try to even the series Monday night. Game 1 loser Derek Lowe, working on three days' rest, will face Philadelphia's Joe Blanton.	"We're not back yet," Ramirez said. "They won two games, we've got one. The game tomorrow is going to be real important, so that's the game that counts."	Kuroda buzzed Victorino in an apparent attempt to retaliate for Brett Myers throwing behind Ramirez in Game 2. Plate umpire Mike Everitt immediately warned both teams, and Victorino shouted at Kuroda while pointing at his own head and upper body.	"Someone was bound to get hit. The situation called for it," Victorino explained. "Just don't throw at my head."	Victorino grounded out to first baseman Nomar Garciaparra, then exchanged words with Kuroda near the bag. Both dugouts cleared and the bullpens followed.	Kuroda said afterward through a translator that he tried to throw inside, but the ball slipped out of his hand.	Dodgers third base coach Larry Bowa and Phillies first base coach Davey Lopes appeared to be two of the angriest participants in the near-scuffle, yelling at each other before the teams cleared the field. Ramirez also came in from left field and had to be restrained by teammates, manager Joe Torre and an umpire.	"The ball just got a little bit away from Kuroda," Dodgers catcher Russell Martin said. "The last thing we're trying to do is hit somebody in the head. We were just trying to get him uncomfortable up there a little bit.	"Those guys have been swinging the bats pretty well. It's just baseball. They've been throwing up and tight on us, and it got us a little uncomfortable. So it was just a good time to do that."	Myers threw behind Ramirez in the first inning of Game 2 on Friday, and Martin was brushed back as well. The soft-tossing Moyer hit Martin with a pitch in the first inning Sunday night, and reliever Clay Condrey knocked down the Dodgers' catcher in the second.	Martin was hit by another pitch in the seventh, a breaking ball from Chad Durbin, drawing boos from the crowd and prompting Ramirez to climb to the top step of the dugout. But Martin took first base without any trouble.	Crew chief Mike Reilly said the warning was issued to protect the players.	"That's the toughest thing for an umpire to read -- intentional," Reilly said. "But we absolutely had a situation, we had a batter hit and then the retaliation, pitch up high. And we figured at that point that we should put a warning in to stop any further retaliation from the other side coming back out again."	The Phillies and Dodgers don't have a recent history of animosity, unlike Boston and Tampa Bay, the ALCS participants. The Red Sox and Rays have played two peaceful games in their series after a nasty brawl in June.	"I think it's over. I'll squash it," Victorino said.	Torre thought the warning from umpires was proper.	"With the passion that goes on in this postseason, I mean, you work all year to get here, and I think the umpires just basically tried to do the safe thing," he said. "And I can't fault them in that.	"Nobody wants to get hit in the head," he added. "That's certainly frightening. I've been hit a couple of times. I'm not sure that that was the intention, even though the pitch was there. Again, you try to throw a ball inside and sometimes it gets away. But certainly there was no intent on hurting somebody in that area. That I can tell you for sure."	The Phillies and Dodgers have played 11 times this year, including eight in the regular season, with the home team winning every game. And the Dodgers' 23-9 record at home after the All-Star break was the best in the majors.	Kuroda, a 33-year-old rookie making the second postseason start of a career that includes 11 years in the Japanese Central League, gave up five hits and two runs before being relieved by Cory Wade with two on and nobody out in the seventh. Wade retired the next three batters.	The 45-year-old Moyer, who became the oldest pitcher to start a league championship series game, lasted only 1 1/3 innings for his shortest outing since July 4, 1998. He gave up six hits and six runs.	"He had a tough time tonight," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said. "They came out swinging on him. They were not taking very many pitches. And they hit some balls hard and also seemed like everything they hit went through for a hit."	The Dodgers had a 1-0 lead by the time Moyer had thrown five pitches on singles by Rafael Furcal, Andre Ethier and Ramirez. Casey Blake singled in another run before DeWitt lined a 2-2 pitch into the right-field corner to clear the bases and send the towel-waving, blue-clad fans at Dodger Stadium into a frenzy.	The announced attendance of 56,800 -- 800 more than listed capacity -- was the largest in Dodger Stadium history. Tiger Woods was a guest in owner Frank McCourt's box, wearing a Dodgers cap and NL West division champions T-shirt.	The Phillies got a run in the second on Ryan Howard's leadoff double and a two-out RBI single by Pedro Feliz, but Furcal hit Moyer's first pitch over the left-center wall in the bottom half to make it 6-1.	Garciaparra, making his first start of the postseason, hit a two-out RBI single off J.A. Happ in the fourth to extend the Dodgers' lead to 7-1.	The Phillies didn't have a baserunner after Feliz's second-inning hit until Chase Utley doubled to start the seventh. Howard and Pat Burrell followed with singles to make it 7-2 and chase Kuroda.	Game notes	 Moyer, who turns 46 next month, became the second-oldest pitcher to start a postseason game, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. The oldest was Jack Quinn, who was 46 years, 99 days when he started Game 4 of the 1929 World Series for the Philadelphia A's.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

BOSTON --  B.J. Upton, Evan Longoria and the rest of the Tampa Bay Rays have quickly become a playoff monster.	Upton hit a three-run home run and Longoria also homered off a suddenly shaky Jon Lester, then Rocco Baldelli and Carlos Pena cleared the Green Monster later Monday to give the Rays a 9-1 victory over the Boston Red Sox and a 2-1 lead in the AL Championship Series.	Matt Garza held Boston scoreless through six innings as Tampa Bay put the defending World Series champions in a postseason hole for the first time since they overcame a 3-1 deficit in last year's ALCS against Cleveland. Now the Rays right-hander, who thought he was sent to baseball purgatory when he was traded from Minnesota to Tampa Bay last offseason, has brought them within two wins of their first AL pennant.	"When I first got traded, yes, there was a doubt. But walking into the clubhouse in spring training, it was like, 'We could actually pull this thing off,'" said Garza, the only Tampa Bay pitcher to lose in the first-round series against the White Sox.	"Everybody was on that one mission, and that was to win. We want to win now. We don't want to be the team that waits for later, we want to win now," he said.	Andy Sonnanstine will try to win Game 4 for the Rays when he faces knuckleballer Tim Wakefield in Game 4 of the best-of-seven series on Tuesday night.	Fenway Park has batting practice baseballs older than the Rays franchise, and the 37-foot wall that looms over left field is the signature feature of the major leagues' oldest ballpark. But Tampa Bay, which climbed past the Yankees and Red Sox in the regular season, treated the Monster like just another old-fashioned obstacle to overcome.	Upton, whose shallow sacrifice fly in the 11th inning won Game 2, hit a three-run homer in the third that sailed completely out of the park. Longoria added a solo shot later in the third -- also off Lester, who pitched a no-hitter at Fenway in May and was 11-1 at home this year.	Baldelli added on a three-run shot in the eighth and Pena made it 9-1 in the ninth, both off Paul Byrd. A lifetime Ray, Baldelli had never appeared in the postseason before; Pena is well-traveled -- this is his fifth team, including the Red Sox -- but he somehow managed to avoid appearing in a playoff game until arriving in Tampa Bay.	The four homers in a game tied the ALCS home run record last matched by Boston in Game 2 against Tampa Bay on Saturday.	"Solo home runs are good, but three-run homers mean so much more. It put us up 4-0 and gave us all the confidence in the world," said Upton, who has five homers in the playoffs after hitting just nine during the regular season. "We feel the sky's the limit for us all year. To beat [Lester], and to beat him at Fenway, hopefully it'll have a snowball effect."	The Rays also hit hard on the basepaths. Carl Crawford bowled over Boston catcher Jason Varitek on a play at the plate. There was no immediate reprisal in a matchup between teams that have tangled in the past.	The Red Sox put two on with nobody out in the seventh to chase Garza, then J.P. Howell gave up a sacrifice fly. Howell pitched two innings and Edwin Jackson closed out the victory.	Lester, who hadn't allowed an earned run in four previous postseason outings -- including last year's World Series clincher against Colorado -- gave up four earned runs on eight hits in 5 2/3 innings. He gave up an unearned run on Varitek's passed ball in the second, then caused his own problems in the third.	"I think some people come to expect you to go out there every single day and be a robot and do it," outfielder Jason Bay said. "Unfortunately, that's not the case."	Jason Bartlett singled and Akinori Iwamura doubled off the Monster before Upton hit a towering shot that cleared the wall and the Monster Seats atop it -- his fifth homer of the playoffs. One out later, Longoria hit his fourth home run of the postseason, tying a rookie record set by Miguel Cabrera in 2003.	"They come equipped with all the bells and whistles," manager Joe Maddon said. "They feel like they belong here, and that's a big reason why they've been able to perform with calm and permit everybody see how good they are. ... Knowing them on a daily basis, it does not surprise me."	Game notes	 Lester needed just four pitches to get through the first inning, then he walked Longoria to lead off the second. After not allowing a leadoff runner in his previous two playoff starts, he let the leadoff man on in three consecutive innings. ... Boston SS Alex Cora and RF Baldelli started Monday for the first time in the ALCS. ... Upton has hit safely in six consecutive playoff games. ... Byrd made his first relief appearance since the 2004 playoffs, when he was with Atlanta. ... Upton hit three homers against Chicago in the first round and one against Boston on Saturday. Longoria also homered in Game 2, when the upstart Rays evened the series.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

LOS ANGELES -- Shane Victorino and the Philadelphia Phillies struck back with long balls rather than beanballs to move within one win of the World Series.	That's the way they've played it all year.	After ducking a pitch thrown over his head the previous day, Victorino and much-traveled pinch-hitter Matt Stairs delivered two-run homers in the eighth inning Monday night, lifting the Phillies to a 7-5 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers for a 3-1 lead in the NL Championship Series.	Lefty ace Cole Hamels, who won the series opener, can pitch the Phillies to their first World Series since 1993 in Game 5 on Wednesday night. He'll be opposed by Game 2 loser Chad Billingsley.	"This was the biggest game we've won so far," Philadelphia manager Charlie Manuel said. "But the next one is even bigger. That's kind of how we look at it."	Brad Lidge got his first four-out save for the Phillies, remaining perfect this season. It was the first time the visiting team has won a game in 12 meetings between the clubs this year.	After squandering a pair of leads, Manny Ramirez and the Dodgers have a tough task ahead. Only 11 teams in major league history have come back from 3-1 deficits to win a best-of-seven postseason series -- two in the NLCS.	There were no brushback pitches or other trouble Monday night, unlike Game 3 when the benches and bullpens emptied in the third inning, moments after Dodgers starter Hiroki Kuroda threw a pitch over Victorino's head in retaliation for Philadelphia's high-and-tight pitches earlier in the series.	Victorino was one of seven people fined Monday for their conduct during the near-scuffle.	With a runner at first and one out in the eighth, Victorino lined Cory Wade's first pitch into the right-field bullpen to tie the game at 5.	"My emotions obviously kind of got to me last night," the plucky Victorino said. "But going into today's game you turn the page and you forget about it. It was just going out there, trying to get a win and getting one step closer to the World Series. But it's still far from over."	After a two-out single by Carlos Ruiz, manager Joe Torre called on closer Jonathan Broxton, the seventh Los Angeles pitcher. Broxton tried to throw a 3-1 fastball past Stairs, and the 40-year-old left-handed hitter drove it more than halfway up the right-field pavilion to put the Phillies ahead.	That was just what Stairs intended.	"My whole career, even back in the early days, my approach was try to hit the ball out of the ballpark," he said. "And it's something I enjoyed doing. In batting practice, I try to hit every ball out of the ballpark. I'm not going to lie, it's fun. I try to hit home runs and that's it. I'm not going to hit a single and steal second base. So I think the biggest thing is to get up there, swing hard and elevate."	Broxton allowed only two homers in 69 innings during the regular season. This one was a no-doubter the moment it left Stairs' bat.	"I fell behind in the count and made a mistake over the plate and he cashed in," Broxton said. "He's a home run hitter. You've got to wipe it out and get ready to play them again."	Stairs has played for 11 teams in his career. Philadelphia picked him up from Toronto on Aug. 30.	The Phillies hit an NL-leading 214 homers during the regular season and have nine in eight playoff games, good for 17 of their 35 runs.	Lidge, the Phillies' sixth pitcher, earned his fifth postseason save in five chances -- but it wasn't easy.	A perfect 41-for-41 in save opportunities during the regular season, Lidge entered a game in the eighth in a save situation for the first time this year when he came in with two outs and nobody on. Ramirez greeted him with a double, and Russell Martin struck out but reached first on a wild pitch before James Loney flied out.	Lidge retired the side in order in the ninth, making the Phillies 85-0 when leading after eight innings this year, including six wins in the postseason.	"It's amazing," Lidge said. "That speaks a lot about our hitters and how much they believe in themselves and the talent they have to come back."	Torre said he wouldn't have handled his bullpen any differently.	"We just didn't get the job done," he said. "Cory Wade's numbers against left-handed hitters this year have been really good. He threw a breaking ball and it stayed up and Shane just knocked the hell out of it."	Torre canceled the Dodgers' workout on Tuesday.	"These guys are fighting their hearts out, and just I told them to be back here on Wednesday to be ready to play baseball," he said. "We have to win the remaining games. We can only do it one at a time. I sense we'll be back right here with the right attitude."	The Dodgers scored twice in the sixth for a 5-3 lead. Casey Blake, who struck out in his first two at-bats, greeted reliever Chad Durbin by hitting a 1-2 pitch over the left-field wall for his first postseason homer.	Juan Pierre, making his first start of the postseason, followed with a double and pinch-hitter Matt Kemp walked. Scott Eyre relieved and first baseman Ryan Howard threw wildly past first on Rafael Furcal's sacrifice bunt, allowing Pierre to score and putting runners at second and third.	Andre Ethier lined to first and, after Ramirez drew his second intentional walk of the game to load the bases, second baseman Chase Utley snared Martin's liner and turned it into a double play.	The Dodgers took a 3-2 lead in the fifth, scoring twice with Ramirez delivering a tying single. He is 7-for-8 with a homer and seven RBIs with runners in scoring position during the playoffs.	The Phillies tied it in the sixth when Howard scored from third on Chan Ho Park's two-out wild pitch.	Lowe, pitching on three days' rest for the fifth time in his career, allowed six hits and two runs in five innings. Blanton also went five innings, giving up seven hits and three runs.	Game notes	Orel Hershiser, one of the Dodgers' stars in the 1988 World Series, threw out the ceremonial first pitch to son Jordan. ... Ramirez extended his record streak of getting at least one RBI in league championship series games to eight. He reached base in all five plate appearances on a single, double and three walks -- two intentional.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

BOSTON --  They fluttered in and rocketed out: three more homers sent sailing over the Green Monster, and Tampa Bay was on its way to another blowout in Boston.	Suddenly, the upstart Rays are one win from their first AL pennant.	Evan Longoria hit his rookie-record fifth home run of the playoffs, and Carlos Pena and Willy Aybar also homered off aging knuckleballer Tim Wakefield on Tuesday night to give Tampa Bay a 13-4 victory over the Red Sox that left the defending champions on the brink of elimination.	"We know we're real close now to going to the World Series," said Carl Crawford, who tied an AL Championship Series record with five hits. "A lot of guys won't say it: There's a nice vibe right now."	Aybar had four hits and five RBIs, and Andy Sonnanstine pitched 7 1/3 sharp innings as Tampa Bay took a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven playoff. After an off day, James Shields will have a chance to pitch the Rays to the Series when he faces Game 1 winner Daisuke Matsuzaka on Thursday night at Fenway Park.	"They're dangerous, they play loose and have good chemistry. Sometimes it's an advantage when there aren't a lot of expectations," said Red Sox pitcher Paul Byrd, who was on the Indians when they blew a 3-1 lead over Boston in last year's ALCS. "I don't think anybody thought we would go back to our place and get beat up like this."	Tampa Bay had never even approached a .500 record during its first decade in the majors before edging wild-card Boston for the AL East title by two games. But the Rays were poised and powerful against a Red Sox team that has made the playoffs in five of the last six years, advancing to the ALCS four times and winning it all twice.	Facing the 42-year-old Wakefield, the oldest pitcher to start an ALCS game, the league's newest team homered three times in the first three innings to take a 5-0 lead. The Rays scored another in the fifth and blew it open with five more in the sixth when seven straight batters reached base to make it 11-1.	"Sitting through that wasn't a whole lot of fun," Red Sox manager Terry Francona said. "We've been on the other side. When it happens to you, you've got to get through it the best you can, and we'll need to regroup as quickly as we can."	Fans lined up for the exits after the Red Sox went down 1-2-3 in the sixth -- the third inning in a row they were retired in order; TV showed horror-master Stephen King reading a book in the stands, bored.	On the field, it was twice as scary.	One night after the Rays hit four homers to beat Boston 9-1, they hit three more and totaled 14 hits against five Red Sox pitchers.	"Last night was nice," said Crawford, who rushed back from hand surgery to be ready for the playoffs after missing most of the last two months of the regular season. "But tonight was even better."	Wakefield, who was making his first appearance in 16 days, lasted just 2 2/3 innings, giving up five runs, including Longoria's fifth postseason homer to break the rookie record set by Florida's Miguel Cabrera in 2003. Red Sox reliever Justin Masterson allowed another run; Manny Delcarmen gave up five more while getting just one out; 42-year-old Mike Timlin gave up two more in the eighth.	"Right now it's kind of contagious," Rays manager Joe Maddon said. "I don't want to see us do anything different."	Sonnanstine retired 12 consecutive batters in all after Kevin Cash's homer to lead off the third and make it 5-1. The Rays right-hander, who pitched 13 shutout innings against Boston in a pair of September no-decisions, allowed just two hits before David Ortiz's leadoff triple in the seventh.	Ortiz, who had been hitless in his first 12 at-bats in the series, scored on a groundout to make it 11-2, and Boston chased Sonnanstine while adding two more in the eighth.	Game notes	 Timlin made his record-tying 25th appearance in the ALCS. ... Longoria committed two errors at 3B on a single play in the second inning, bobbling Jason Bay's grounder and then throwing it away. Those were the first two errors committed by the Rays in the postseason. Center fielder B.J. Upton also made an error. ... There were no fisticuffs between the teams that had a bench-clearing brawl in June. Masterson threw a pitch behind Longoria in the fifth. ... Cash became the first Red Sox player to homer in his first postseason at-bat since pitcher Jose Santiago in the opener of the 1967 World Series against St. Louis. ... Wakefield's outing was the shortest postseason start by a Boston pitcher since Bronson Arroyo lasted two innings in Game 3 of the 2004 ALCS against the New York Yankees. Also that night: Yankees outfielder Hideki Matsui went 5-for-6 -- the last player with five hits in the ALCS before Crawford. The Red Sox lost the first three games of that series, then won the next four before sweeping St. Louis in the World Series.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

LOS ANGELES --  The losingest team in pro sports history was soaked in champagne and whooping it up Wednesday night.	Next stop for these Philadelphia Phillies: the World Series.	Jimmy Rollins got them rollin' with a leadoff home run, Cole Hamels pitched his third gem of the playoffs and Philadelphia beat the bumbling Los Angeles Dodgers 5-1 to win the NL championship series 4-1 for its first pennant since 1993.	"After hearing about the '93 team over and over and over again, we finally have a chance to make our mark," Rollins said. "This was an organization that I felt when I got here I wanted to try to change. And I had my opportunity to. You know, we had been used to losing."	Now, the Phillies will go for their second World Series title beginning next Wednesday night at Tampa Bay or Boston. The Rays lead the Red Sox 3-1 in the ALCS, which resumes Thursday night at Fenway Park.	Last year, the Phillies became the first professional team to lose 10,000 games. This season, the ball is bouncing their way.	The NL East champions, who didn't clinch a playoff berth until the final weekend of the season, took advantage of three errors by shortstop Rafael Furcal in the fifth inning and shrugged off another homer by Manny Ramirez.	Brad Lidge closed it out for the Phillies, who won their lone championship in 1980 by beating Kansas City in six games. They also reached the World Series in 1915, 1950, 1983 and 1993, when they lost to Toronto in six games on Joe Carter's ninth-inning homer off Mitch Williams.	Now they're headed back, carrying the hopes of a championship-starved city that hasn't had a title to celebrate since the NBA's 76ers won it all in 1983.	"This is for the city for Philadelphia," manager Charlie Manuel said. "We have one more step, one big step -- then we're going to make a grand parade."	You can bet your last cheesesteak, Broad Street is primed for a party. And those Philly fans, who always expect failure, can relax -- at least for a week.	"These guys are going crazy right now," slugger Ryan Howard said. "I can only imagine how it is in Philadelphia."	Back home, jubilant Phillies fans poured into the city streets, jumping on cars and celebrating.	Ramirez homered in the sixth to end Hamels' shutout bid in what might have been his final game with the Dodgers. The slugging left fielder, who hit .520 with four homers, 10 RBIs and 11 walks in eight playoff games, can become a free agent after the World Series. He batted .396 with 17 homers and 53 RBIs in 53 regular-season games for the Dodgers after being acquired July 31 from Boston.	On the bench, Joe Torre came up short in the postseason again. He won four World Series in his first five years as manager of the New York Yankees from 1996-2000, but hasn't won one since. This was his first year as the Dodgers' skipper after 12 with the Yankees.	"I was proud to be their manager," Torre said. "This was an up-and-down year. I think they learned a lot. They learned to come together. This game tonight got a little ugly in the middle with the defense, but they never stopped plugging away. And that's what John Wooden taught me a long time ago, that it's not always the club that wins that you're proudest of. And I certainly was satisfied with what I saw here."	For Manuel, it was an emotional night. His 87-year-old mother died Friday, shortly before the Phillies won 8-5 in Game 2.	"I guarantee you my mom's watching right now," he said after Wednesday's victory.	Rollins, last year's NL MVP who dropped off considerably this year, also hit a leadoff homer in the first-round clincher at Milwaukee.	"This is definitely the first step," he said. "We've taken a lot of steps, but this is definitely the biggest step and the first step in the right direction. We've just to go out there and find a way to win four more."	Hamels, the series MVP, limited the Dodgers to five hits in seven innings. The 24-year-old lefty has allowed three runs in 22 innings during the postseason, with two wins over Los Angeles and another over the Brewers in the first round. He'll have ample rest to pitch Game 1 of the World Series.	"We were able to enjoy this moment," Hamels said. "To get an award like this is something surreal."	Ryan Madson worked a scoreless eighth and Lidge blanked Los Angeles in the ninth.	Ramirez is one of several high-profile free agents who might have played their final game for the Dodgers, along with Furcal, Nomar Garciaparra, Jeff Kent, Casey Blake, Derek Lowe and Greg Maddux.	Furcal, who missed 125 games with back problems this year before being activated in late September, tied a postseason record by committing three errors in the fifth, leading to two unearned runs.	"It's very frustrating the last game of the series at home to play like that," Furcal said. "It's very disappointing to me."	In the first, Rollins drove a full-count pitch from loser Chad Billingsley over the right-center fence. The switch-hitter came to the plate with only two hits in 17 at-bats in the series.	"They lived by the homer and they died by the homer," Torre said. "They got us this time. That was huge."	Billingsley walked Rollins, who stole second, and Chase Utley in the third before Howard and Pat Burrell hit RBI singles with two outs to make it 3-0. Chan Ho Park relieved with the bases loaded and worked out of trouble.	Billingsley, 6-0 with a 1.60 ERA in his last seven regular-season starts at home, lasted just 2 2/3 innings. The 24-year-old right-hander, who went 16-10 with a 3.14 ERA this season, gave up a career-high eight runs in 2 1/3 innings in Game 2, won by the Phillies 8-5.	The Phillies made it 5-0 in the fifth against Maddux thanks to the errors by Furcal. The first two came on one play, when he booted Burrell's potential inning-ending double-play grounder and then threw the ball away, allowing one run to score. The second came when Furcal made another throwing error on Carlos Ruiz's two-out grounder, drawing boos from the disappointed Dodger Stadium crowd of 56,800.	The only other player to commit three errors in one inning in the postseason, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, was Dodgers center fielder Willie Davis, who did so in the fifth inning of Game 2 in the 1966 World Series against Baltimore.	The crowd came alive in the bottom of the fifth after a leadoff single by Blake when Hall of Famer Tom Lasorda, who managed the Dodgers from 1977-96, stood near the team's dugout waving a white towel, with the image shown on the video board. Matt Kemp followed with a single, but rookie Blake DeWitt grounded into his second double play of the game and Kent struck out as a pinch hitter.	Ramirez hit a 1-2 pitch over the right-field wall with two outs in the sixth, but Russell Martin took a called third strike to end the inning.	Hamels walked Kemp and pinch-hitter Garciaparra with two outs in the seventh before throwing a called third strike past Kent -- the last of his 104 pitches.	Game notes	 The 81-year-old Lasorda, now a member of the Dodgers' front office, threw out the ceremonial first pitch. His granddaughter, Emily, threw one as well. ... Ramirez has at least one RBI in nine straight LCS games. ... Including the playoffs, the Phillies are 86-0 when leading after eight innings.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

BOSTON --  Fenway Park fell silent, and the Boston Red Sox were on the verge of going down without a whimper.	Then baseball's comeback kings did it again.	Trailing by seven runs with seven outs left in their season, the Red Sox pulled off the biggest postseason rally since 1929. Boston staved off elimination in the AL championship series with an 8-7 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays on Thursday night when J.D. Drew singled home the winning run with two outs in the ninth.	"The first six innings we did nothing. They had their way with us every way possible," Red Sox manager Terry Francona said after a draining 4-hour, 8-minute thriller. "And then this place came unglued, and we've seen that before. But because of the situation we're in, it just -- that was pretty magical."	The Red Sox, who twice this decade rallied from 3-1 deficits to win the pennant and then the World Series, have a chance to do it an unprecedented third time in five years when the series resumes in Tropicana Field. Josh Beckett is scheduled to face James Shields in Game 6 on Saturday night.	The cowbells will be clanging again for the home team. The tarps will come off the upper deck to accommodate the Rays' newly found fans. And the catwalks are definitely in play for another game.	The AL winner faces Philadelphia in the World Series starting Wednesday night.	"There's a lot of fight in that dugout," Drew said. "And a lot of guys knew as soon as we got some runs on the board, we could get something going."	Boston trailed 7-0 with two outs in the seventh, then rallied when Dustin Pedroia hit an RBI single and David Ortiz added a three-run homer against Grant Balfour. Drew hit a two-run homer in the eighth, and Coco Crisp tied it with a two-out RBI single off Dan Wheeler.	The Red Sox have won eight consecutive ALCS games when facing elimination.	"It was pretty much the most amazing thing I've ever been a part of," Crisp said, "to be down 7-0 in an elimination game and be able to come back."	In the ninth, Kevin Youkilis reached on an infield single with two outs when he grounded to Evan Longoria and wound up at second as the throw bounced in front of first baseman Carlos Pena and into the stands for an error.	Jason Bay was intentionally walked, and Drew lined a single to right off J.P. Howell over the outstretched glove of Gabe Gross and over the fence as Youkilis scored.	"Hopefully, there'll be time when we can sit back and think 'This is what got us over the hump," Francona said. "But we're still climbing."	No team has repeated as World Series champion since the New York Yankees won three straight from 1998-2000. That mark is still in jeopardy.	Others already are gone.	Pena tied an ALCS record by homering in his third straight game, then Longoria broke it five pitches later with his sixth postseason homer. Tampa Bay's 13 homers set an ALCS record, breaking Boston's mark of 12 against the Yankees in 2003. B.J. Upton and Longoria became the first teammates in AL history with at least six homers apiece in the postseason.	Tampa Bay took the first two at Fenway by a combined 22-5, then Upton pounced on Daisuke Matsuzaka for a two-run homer on the game's ninth pitch. Carlos Pena and Longoria hit back-to-back homers for the second straight game, and Scott Kazmir held Boston to two hits over six innings, never allowing a runner past second base.	Then the Red Sox sprung to life.	A hero of Boston's 2004 and '07 titles, Ortiz had just one hit and no RBIs in the series heading into Game 5.	"There goes Papi and there goes Drew, I mean that can happen at any time," Rays manager Joe Maddon said. "We're just going to have to go back home and get it going again. We played a great game. They just came back and beat us. That happens."	The seven-run deficit was the largest overcome in a postseason game since Game 4 of 1929 World Series, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. In that one, the Philadelphia Athletics trailed by eight before a 10-run seventh inning powered them past the Chicago Cubs 10-8.	The Red Sox fell behind the Yankees in the 2004 ALCS before becoming the first major league team to rally from a 3-0 postseason deficit. Once in the World Series, they swept the St. Louis Cardinals for their first title in 86 years.	Three seasons later, Boston trailed the Cleveland Indians 3-1 in the ALCS before winning three straight and sweeping Colorado in the Series for their second title in four seasons.	"We all felt we couldn't let it end here, and we all believed we could come back," Matsuzaka said through a translator.	Akinori Iawmura led off the game with a single, then Upton homered onto the ledge atop the Green Monster to make it 2-0. Pena and Longoria went back-to-back in the third and it was 5-0. Manny Delcarmen walked two batters to start the seventh before closer Jonathan Papelbon, pressed into early service to save the season, gave up Upton's two-run double to make it 7-0.	Then came the Rays' big collapse.	"If you dwell on something like that and you get your mind in a negative mode," Maddon said, "nothing good is going to happen after that."	Game notes	 The top three batters in Tampa's order reached base 10 times. ... Upton has 10 RBIs in the series. ... Carl Crawford went 0-for-4 after going 5-for-5 in Game 4. ... Ortiz had been 1-for-17 in the series before his homer. ... Curt Schilling, the bloody-socked hero of the team's angst-ending 2004 championship, threw out the ceremonial pitch -- his only appearance on the Fenway mound this season. He bounced it about 8 feet in front of the plate. ... Matsuzaka allowed five runs in four-plus innings.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Now look who's one win away from the World Series.	The Boston Red Sox, playing like the defending champs they are, came out swinging and beat Tampa Bay 4-2 Saturday night to force a Game 7 in an AL championship series the Rays all but wrapped up two days earlier.	Slumping Jason Varitek hit a tiebreaking home run in the sixth inning as Boston evened the ALCS at 3-all. No late drama needed by the Red Sox this time -- they rallied from seven runs down with only seven outs left to win Game 5.	Now Jon Lester starts Game 7 for the Red Sox on Sunday night against Matt Garza in a rematch of Game 3, won by the Rays 9-1 at Fenway Park. Last year, the Red Sox trailed Cleveland 3-1 before winning three in a row, then sweeping Colorado for their second Series title in four seasons.	"It's great to get to Game 7, to battle like this," said Kevin Youkilis, who homered and drove in two runs. "We went out there and played like it was our last game. It was awesome."	The pennant winner hosts the World Series opener Wednesday night against the well-rested Philadelphia Phillies, who won the NL pennant over the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games.	"It's all about how we react to the moment, and it's a seventh game," Rays manager Joe Maddon said. "It's a great learning experience. For us to win that game would be something special for us, also. So it's not about looking into the past. It's about looking into the future right now."	Red Sox ace Josh Beckett, who struggled in his first two starts of the playoffs, allowed two runs and four hits in five innings despite reduced velocity, and Hideki Okajima, Justin Masterson and Jonathan Papelbon combined for hitless relief.	"It's probably pretty appropriate. We come down to the last game, and whoever plays better gets to move on," Red Sox manager Terry Francona said.	B.J. Upton tied an AL record with his seventh home run of the postseason. After Boston went ahead 2-1, Tampa Bay tied it on Jason Bartlett's fifth-inning homer. But the Rays didn't get another hit, and the Red Sox improved to 9-0 in ALCS elimination games under manager Terry Francona.	Varitek, the Red Sox captain, had been 0-for-14 in the series before his homer in the sixth finished Shields, who allowed four runs and nine hits in 5 2/3 innings.	"He wears a 'C' on that jersey for a lot of different reasons, but none more important than how much respect everybody in that clubhouse, including players, coaches, upper management, has for him," Beckett said.	The Red Sox, trying to become the first repeat champions since the 1998-00 Yankees, were jubilant.	"We'll take runs any way we can get it," Francona said. "But the way it happened, and as hard as he's worked, it meant a lot to everybody. "	David Ortiz added an RBI single off J.P. Howell to pad the lead.	Boston bounced back from a 3-1 ALCS deficit in 1986 against the Angels, then in 2004 became the first major league team to win a postseason series when trailing 3-0, beating the Yankees for the pennant before sweeping St. Louis in the World Series. Then came last year's comeback.	It was a strange night in different ways. The first 20 minutes of the game weren't shown on television because TBS had an equipment failure.	And plate umpire Derryl Cousins left with a bruised collarbone after three innings, causing a 15-minute delay. Cousins was struck by a foul ball hit by Varitek in the second, but remained in the game until the delay. He was replaced by crew chief Tim McClelland, who had been working first base.	"The delay didn't really bug me that much. I had just come out," Beckett said. "I think James Shields probably had the worst end of that deal."	Upton, who only hit nine homers in 531 regular-season at-bats, homered in the first inning off Beckett, driving the ball off one of the catwalks at Tropicana Field. He tied Troy Glaus (2002) with his seventh homer in a single postseason, one behind record-holders Barry Bonds (2002) and Carlos Beltran (2004).	Right after that, the television broadcast began.	Youkilis led off the second inning with his drive into the left center-field seats off Shield, then gave the Red Sox a 2-1 lead in the third when he grounded out after Dustin Pedroia walked and raced to third on Ortiz's double down the right-field line.	Bartlett's homer tied it in the fifth.	Okajima pitched two scoreless innings, and Masterson got out of a potential tight situation in the eighth. He hit Bartlett with a pitch leading off and went to a 2-0 count on Akinori Iwamura when pitching coach John Farrell visited the mound. Papelbon struck out Iwamura, got two straight outs, and then Papelbon pitched a 1-2-3 ninth, extending his major league-record career postseason scoreless streak to 25 innings over 16 appearances.	"The important thing is we found a way to win this game," Varitek said. "It was a big win for us."	Game notes	 Youkilis has hit safely in 12 of 13 career ALCS games. ... Upton has seven homers in 42 postseason at-bats after hitting nine in 531 at-bats during the regular season. ... Bartlett hit one homer during the regular season. ... Papelbon earned his third save of this postseason.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Down to their last chance, the Tampa Bay Rays left no doubt they were World Series-worthy, after all.	Believe it: Baseball's doormats have arrived.	Going from worst to first, the young Rays completed a stunning run to their first pennant, holding off the defending champion Boston Red Sox 3-1 Sunday night behind Matt Garza's masterful pitching in Game 7 of the AL Championship Series.	"It's unbelievable," center fielder B.J. Upton said. "We battled a lot of adversity this year. We stuck together as a team."	And, they showed a bit of Boston-like resolve when they needed it.	The Rays nearly let the series slip away when they blew a seven-run lead late in Game 5 and lost meekly Saturday night. But when rookie David Price struck out J.D. Drew with the bases loaded to end the eighth inning, the Rays were on their way.	Price, who didn't make his major league debut until late September, also worked the ninth, walking Jason Bay and striking out Mark Kotsay and Jason Varitek before getting pinch-hitter Jed Lowrie ground into a game-ending force play.	Tampa Bay's worst to first saga was the feel-good story of this season, and it probably was fitting that Price -- the least experienced of the young Rays -- was on the mound at the most critical point of the ALCS.	"Minimal experience, but I was not hesitant," manager Joe Maddon said.	When it was over, players and coaches streamed out of the dugout and mobbed Price, eventually falling to the ground in a cluster that continued to grow when others began leaping on the pile.	Music blared and the crowd of 40,473 stood and cheered.	The party moved inside briefly before players returned to the field, racing up and down the right field stands spraying fans with champagne before settling down for the presentation of AL championship trophy.	"It's not what we expected to happen," Boston slugger David Ortiz said. "You have to give them credit. They pitched well. They've got good hitters."	The Rays were a 200-1 shot to win the World Series before the season started. Now, they'll host the Philadelphia Phillies in Game 1 Wednesday night.	Garza beat Boston twice in a week and was picked as the MVP.	"As a kid I think everybody pictures this night," he said. "Usually it's Game 7 of the World Series but I'll take Game 7 of the ALCS."	Willy Aybar homered and Evan Longoria and Rocco Baldelli also drove in runs to support Garza. Acquired in an offseason trade with Minnesota, Garza limited the Red Sox to Dustin Pedroia's first-inning home run.	Four more wins and Maddon's bunch will become the first team to go from worst in the majors to World Series champion in just one season.	The Red Sox were hoping to win their third crown in five years.	"We didn't get as far as we wanted," Boston manager Terry Francona said. "We came out to win and go to the World Series and we didn't accomplish that."	Longoria's fourth-inning double off Jon Lester tied it at 1-all. Baldelli's RBI single put the Rays ahead in the fifth after Aybar doubled and Dioner Navarro reached on an infield single.	Garza took the mound for the biggest game of his life with something, perhaps cotton balls, stuffed in his ears to help drown out the noise at sold-out Tropicana Field.	The 24-year-old right-hander struck out nine before shortstop Jason Bartlett booted Alex Cora's ground ball for an error, leading off a tense eighth.	Boston went on to load the bases when Kevin Youkilis drew a two-out walk. Price, the No. 1 pick in the 2007 draft, became the fifth Tampa Bay pitcher of the inning -- quite a spot for someone who started the year in Class A.	Drew, who capped the Game 5 rally with a ninth-inning single, struck out with a check-swing on a 97 mph fastball to end the threat. Price worked around a leadoff walk in the ninth and when pinch-hitter Lowrie grounded out, the celebration began.	"I wanted the ball," Price said. "I think everybody down there in the 'pen wanted the ball tonight."	The Rays dropped the "Devil" from their name before the season and came out with a new identity: Gone were the laughable losers who finished last in the AL East in nine of their first 10 seasons, the snowbird specials whose quirky Tropicana Field filled with transplanted Bostonians whenever the Red Sox visited.	After splitting the first two games of the series at home, though, it was Tampa Bay that made itself at home in an opponent's ballpark, with the Rays sending shot after shot sailing over the Green Monster. In all, the Rays outscored the Red Sox 29-13 in the three games at Fenway Park, hitting 10 home runs.	But the young Rays' postseason inexperience showed in Game 5, when a normally reliable bullpen blew a 7-0 lead over the last three innings, allowing Boston to save its season with an 8-7 victory.	The Red Sox were the eighth team to rally from a 3-1 deficit to force Game 7 of an LCS, and they're the only club to do it more than once. The Red Sox also battled back in 1986, 2004 and 2007, and went on to win the World Series the last two times.	With the tarps covering nearly 5,800 seats in the upper deck removed for the second straight night, more than 40,000 fans packed the domed stadium for a rematch of the starting pitchers from Game 3, won by Tampa Bay 9-1 at Fenway Park.	Many fans wore Red Sox gear and were even more noticeable when they stood and cheered as Pedroia circled the bases after lining a pitch into the left-field stands. But there would be little for the Boston faithful to cheer the rest of the night.	No team has repeated as World Series champion since the New York Yankees won three straight from 1998-2000. That mark is safe for another year.	"We played as hard as we could. Just kind of ran out of magic," Pedroia said. "I'm proud of everybody, but it's obviously a tough loss."	Game notes	 Rays senior adviser Don Zimmer, a former Red Sox manager who has six World Series rings, threw out the ceremonial first pitch. ... Ortiz said after the game that he's not planning to have surgery on his left wrist during the offseason.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  The waiting game turned into a winning game for Cole Hamels, Chase Utley and the Philadelphia Phillies.	Hamels escaped trouble to win his fourth postseason start, Utley hit a two-run homer in the first inning and the Phillies beat the Tampa Bay Rays 3-2 in the World Series opener Wednesday night.	The worst-to-first Rays flopped in their first game in baseball's ultimate event, managing just five hits -- none after the fifth inning.	For now, this puts an end to the rest vs. rust debate.	"I don't think it threw off our timing too much," Utley said of the six-day layoff. "I think tomorrow we should definitely be more back on track."	Philadelphia will try to make it two in a row at Tropicana Field when Brett Myers pitches against James Shields in Game 2 Thursday night.	The team that won the opener has captured the Series 63 of 103 times, including 10 of the last 11. But the team with home-field advantage has taken 18 of the last 22 titles.	"It's huge," Phillies closer Brad Lidge said. "You try and downplay it, but obviously you're coming into a place like this, you want to make sure you get the first game, especially because you got your ace on the mound. It's really important to do that."	Hamels, MVP of the NL championship series, improved to 4-0 with a 1.55 ERA this postseason. He had only a pair of 1-2-3 innings, but the composed 24-year-old left-hander allowed two runs and five hits in seven innings.	He benefited from the extra rest.	"I think for a starter it's almost better sometimes, just because it gives you more time to heal up," Hamels said.	Ryan Madson pitched a perfect eighth. Lidge worked the ninth for his 47th save in 47 chances this year, silencing the Rays and their cowbell-clanging fans.	"If you want to take the wind out of the sails," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said, "you shut the cow bells up and get some home runs. That will do it -- except in Citizens Bank Park. If you hit enough there, they ring a bell. They ring the Liberty Bell."	Manuel could crack the jokes. Not much to yuck about for the Rays and their fans. While Carl Crawford homered, playoff stars B.J. Upton and Evan Longoria went a combined 0-for-8.	Scott Kazmir, selected two picks ahead of Hamels in the first round of the 2002 amateur draft, struggled with his control and gave up three runs, six hits and four walks in six innings.	"It wasn't an easy night, and I felt like I had to battle every single inning," Kazmir said.	Philadelphia could have romped but went 0-for-13 with runners in scoring position and stranded 11 runners. Their other run even scored on an out, an RBI grounder by Carlos Ruiz.	"It's better to come up empty with a lot of guys in scoring position than not have any at all," Utley said.	Seeking the city's first major title since the NBA's 76ers in 1983, Philadelphia had six days off after beating the Los Angeles Dodgers for the NL pennant, while the Rays didn't finish off the Boston Red Sox until Game 7 on Sunday night.	Jimmy Rollins, Philadelphia's leadoff batter, flied to right fielder Ben Zobrist, who has made just two regular-season career appearances at the position. But then Jayson Werth walked and Utley, after fouling off a bunt attempt, homered on a 2-2 pitch, sending the ball into the right-field seats and becoming the 34th player to homer in his first Series at-bat.	Only 13 of Utley's 33 homers during the regular season were against lefties, and Kazmir allowed just one homer to a left-handed batter in 131 at-bats, with Boston's David Ortiz connecting Sept. 15.	"Fastball, middle of the plate," Utley said. "I was just trying to put the ball into play."	Mitch Williams, an analyst for Comcast SportsNet, started pumping a fist and cheering. The Phillies' last World Series appearance ended when Williams allowed Joe Carter's game-ending homer in Game 6 at Toronto.	Philadelphia had a chance to pad the lead in the second following two walks, but Upton, the center fielder, made a nifty one-hop throw to the plate on Rollins' fly to short center, and catcher Dioner Navarro applied the tag on Shane Victorino for the inning-ending out.	Tampa Bay loaded the bases with one out in the third on two singles around a walk. But third baseman Pedro Feliz went to his left for an impressive pickup on Upton's grounder and started an inning-ending 5-4-3 double play.	"Definitely the kind of momentum swing into our favor," Hamels said. "If they can load the bases with less than two outs and not be able to score, then you definitely have the upper hand."	Ruiz hit an RBI grounder in the fourth following Victorino's leadoff single, but Crawford's homer on a hanging breaking ball cut the lead to a 3-1 in the bottom half.	Akinori Iwamura reached down for an outside 3-2 pitch and drove an opposite-field RBI double to left-center in the fifth, and Upton followed with a foul pop that Ryan Howard reached into the stands to grab -- veteran fans at places such as Fenway Park and Yankee Stadium likely would have not allowed the first baseman to make the play.	Carlos Pena reached leading off the sixth when Howard allowed his grounder to pop off his glove and midsection for an error. But Hamels froze Pena with a pickoff throw and he was easily thrown out at second. Rays manager Joe Maddon screamed unsuccessfully for a balk call, maintaining Hamels' foot landed too far toward the plate.	"I thought it was clearly a balk, and obviously you can't argue a balk," Maddon said. "You get kicked out arguing a balk. What I did was even inappropriate."	Said Hamels: "Yeah, he was out. That's all I can say. "	Utley singled with one out in the seventh, stole second and took third on a wild pitch. But J.P. Howell fanned Howard and, after Pat Burrell walked, Grant Balfour struck out Victorino.	"It's never easy when you're down 0-1," Shields said. "But I think we've been pretty resilient all year long."	It was the first Series game on artificial turf since 1993 -- the Phillies' previous one. ... The Rays played an exaggerated shift on Utley and Howard, often putting three infielders on the right side. ... The Phillies also won the opener in 1980 against Kansas City, starting them to their only title since beginning play in 1883. Philadelphia also started the Series with wins in 1915 and 1983, but dropped the first game in 1950 and 1993.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Big Game James. That's quite a nickname for a pitcher with 32 major league wins.	James Shields definitely deserved it Thursday night.	Shields stymied the slumping Philadelphia Phillies, rookie David Price got the final seven outs and the plucky Tampa Bay Rays rebounded from a rare home loss with a 4-2 victory that tied the World Series at 1-all.	"It was kind of a joke at first," Shields said. "I ended up pitching a couple of good games in the minor leagues and they say my whole organization is calling me 'Big Game.' They don't call me by my first name anymore."	After dropping the opener to ace Cole Hamels and the Phillies, the young Rays earned their first World Series win with help from a squeeze play and a checked swing.	Tampa Bay never really got a huge hit, but neither did the Phillies as Jimmy Rollins & crew fell to 1-for-28 with runners in scoring position.	"That might be one of our sloppiest games all year," manager Charlie Manuel said. "I'm concerned about us hitting with guys on base, because it looks like at times we might be trying a little too hard. But we can fix that."	The series shifts to Philadelphia for Game 3 on Saturday night, though rain is in the forecast. ALCS MVP Matt Garza is scheduled to pitch for Tampa Bay against 45-year-old Jamie Moyer, making his World Series debut.	"We came in here knowing it's going to be a tight series," Rays outfielder B.J. Upton said. "Both clubs are a lot alike."	The Rays scored on Jason Bartlett's safety squeeze and built another rally when Rocco Baldelli walked on a checked swing that seemed to confuse players and umpires alike.	Shields pitched shutout ball into the sixth, working out of trouble just as Hamels did for a 3-2 win Wednesday night. Tampa Bay is 5-3 at home in the postseason after going a major league-best 57-24 during the season.	"I didn't feel too much pressure," Shields said. "The guys in the clubhouse were real relaxed before the game."	The 23-year-old Price, called up in September after he was the top pick in last year's draft, struck out slugger Ryan Howard with two on to end the seventh.	The hard-throwing lefty gave up a pinch-hit homer to Eric Bruntlett in the eighth, then stayed on to close it out against Philadelphia's big boppers.	Carlos Ruiz led off the ninth with a double, and a pitch from Price appeared to graze Rollins' jersey. But it was not called a hit batter, and a frustrated Rollins soon popped out.	Ruiz scored when third baseman Evan Longoria booted Jayson Werth's grounder for an error, but Price fanned Chase Utley and got Howard on a game-ending grounder.	"I was nervous -- very," Price said. "I usually don't even sweat out there and my hat looks like I went swimming with it."	Philadelphia's lone hit with runners in scoring position was Shane Victorino's infield single in the fourth, and that didn't even produce a run.	Living up to his catchy monicker, Shields outpitched Brett Myers. Baldelli thwarted a potential Phillies rally with a strong throw, and Tampa Bay took advantage of two costly mistakes by Werth.	Shields usually flourishes at home, where he was 9-2 with a 2.59 ERA during the season. All four of his postseason starts have come at Tropicana Field, including a win over the Chicago White Sox in Tampa Bay's first playoff game and two tough losses to Boston in the ALCS.	"You feel pretty comfortable when he goes out there under those circumstances," Rays manager Joe Maddon said. "It's kind of a misconception. We're starting to play our first big games now, and he's pitching the same now as when the big game was trying to prevent somebody else from getting to the playoffs."	A 14-game winner during the season, Shields looked surprised when he was pulled in the sixth after 104 pitches. He doffed his cap to the crowd, and Dan Wheeler retired Pedro Feliz on an inning-ending grounder with runners at the corners.	The Phillies had a chance to rally in the fifth after putting two on with one out. Utley hit a looper to right that was caught on the run by Baldelli, who fired to first behind Werth for an inning-ending double play.	Back from two seasons derailed by injuries and mitochondrial disorder, a condition that slows muscle recovery and causes extreme fatigue, Baldelli also was involved on a confusing call in the second that helped Tampa Bay make it 3-0.	He checked his swing on a full-count pitch and plate umpire Kerwin Danley immediately raised his right arm as if to call strike three. But then Danley pointed to first base for an appeal, and umpire Fieldin Culbreth signaled safe.	"It was his intention to go to first base for help on a half-swing that he had as ball four," said Mike Port, Major League Baseball's vice president for umpiring. "He just gave a confusing mechanic. But he had called it a ball, and it was ruled no half-swing anyway. So it was just that particular mechanic that caused confusion."	Myers and several Phillies infielders were puzzled, along with Manuel, who took a few steps out of the dugout but didn't argue long.	"I thought he called the guy out," Manuel said.	Port said the umpires would not be available for comment.	With the bases loaded and two outs, Upton hit an RBI single to right. Werth made a strong throw to cut down Baldelli, who crashed into Ruiz but couldn't dislodge the ball.	Before the next inning started, Baldelli rested on one knee in right field.	In the fourth, Bartlett, the No. 9 hitter, drove in Cliff Floyd with a safety squeeze -- one pitch after fouling off a suicide squeeze attempt. Rays fans clanged their cowbells, just as they were instructed on the scoreboard in a campy "public service announcement" before the game.	Demoted to the minors in July, Myers was in trouble from the start. He issued a leadoff walk to Akinori Iwamura in the first before Upton sliced an opposite-field single to right. Werth booted the ball for a key error that gave both runners an extra base, and Upton clapped his hands after sliding into second.	Carlos Pena drove in a run with a groundout and the Phillies kept their infield back for Longoria, who made it 2-0 with another grounder.	Shields gave up leadoff doubles in the second and third, but escaped both times.	Notes	 Werth made two errors all season. ... Philadelphia's 0-for-19 skid with runners in scoring position was the second-longest drought to start a World Series since the 1966 Los Angeles Dodgers finished 0-for-22 against Baltimore, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.

PHILADELPHIA --  This was midnight madness, and then some, at the World Series.	"Freak things kind of happened there," Eric Bruntlett said after scoring the winning run for the Philadelphia Phillies at 1:47 a.m.	Carlos Ruiz finished off a wacky ninth inning with an infield single with the bases loaded, and the Phillies outlasted the Tampa Bay Rays 5-4 early Sunday in Game 3 for a 2-1 lead.	Ruiz, Chase Utley and Ryan Howard homered for the Phils, but it took three kooky plays to win it on a bases-loaded trickler with no outs.	"It might have took a little squib roller down the third-base line, but at the same time it's better to be lucky sometimes than to be good," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said.	The end was almost as bizarre as the 10:06 p.m. start, the latest in Series history. Baseball waited out a rainstorm that chased most fans out of their seats and delayed Jamie Moyer's first pitch for 91 minutes.	The matchup of Philadelphia's power vs. Tampa Bay's speed left it at 4-all going to the bottom of the ninth.	Then it all came down to this: Rays reliever J.P. Howell hit Bruntlett with a pitch to start the inning. Enter Grant Balfour, who threw a wild pitch that caromed off the backstop to catcher Dioner Navarro, whose throw trying to get Bruntlett skipped into center field.	With Bruntlett on third, the Rays issued two intentional walks and brought in right fielder Ben Zobrist for a five-man infield.	"It looked like they were about to blitz," Howard said.	Ruiz followed with a nubber down the line and third baseman Evan Longoria charged. He dived for the ball, and rushed an underhanded flip home that sailed over Navarro's head.	"You couldn't place a ball better than that. Lucky swing, perfect bounce," Zobrist said.	The single was just the Phils' second hit in 33 chances with runners in scoring position this Series.	The Phillies rushed from the dugout to congratulate Bruntlett at the plate and Ruiz at first base. The giant Liberty Bell in center field clanged in celebration -- no cowbells here at Citizens Bank Park.	"You know what, it's crazy," Howard said. "It's a little nerve-racking but to come out with a victory like that, it's great."	Game 4 is Sunday night and the weather forecast is fine for the matchup between the Phils' Joe Blanton and Andy Sonnanstine.	The Phillies built a 4-1 lead for Moyer on an early home run by Ruiz and consecutive shots by Utley and Howard in the sixth. But it was the little hit that was the biggest of all.	J.C. Romero wound up with the win.	Minus Moyer, the Rays sped back to tie as B.J. Upton became the first AL player to steal three bases in a Series game.	Upton beat out an infield single to open the eighth, swiped second and third on consecutive pitches, and dashed home on a wild throw by Ruiz to make it 4-all.	Tampa Bay's rally dampened the moment Moyer waited for his whole life. The 45-year-old lefty finally got to pitch in the World Series and threw a game that defines his career, bedeviling the Rays with his slo-mo repertoire.	"I think it exceeded every expectation or thought or dream," Moyer said.	Moyer, already a pro before Rays stars Longoria and Upton were born, demonstrated exactly how he's earned 246 major league victories. He struck out both All-Stars with 74 mph changeups, and made the entire lineup look foolish with tentative swings.	Moyer became the second-oldest player in Series history -- Jack Quinn was 47 when he pitched for the Philadelphia Athletics in 1930 -- yet showed he was still spry. He belly-flopped along the first-base line to field Carl Crawford's bunt, and flipped the ball with his glove.	And while millions of people may have switched the TV channel to watch "Saturday Night Live" open with one of their popular political skits, surely baseball fans all over were laughing at watching Moyer pitch a game for the aged.	Hit hard in two losses in the NL playoffs, Moyer left in the seventh with a 4-2 lead after an RBI grounder by Gabe Gross. He tipped his cap toward plate umpire Fieldin Culbreth and then to the crowd that gave him a rousing standing ovation.	Chad Durbin relieved and gave up Jason Bartlett's RBI grounder that pulled the Rays within a run.	Steady rain and gusty wind threatened to postpone the first Series game at Citizens Bank Park. Fans huddled underneath the overhangs and crowded the concourses to watch No. 3 Penn State play No. 10 Ohio State.	Ruiz hit a solo home run in the second off Matt Garza that put the Phillies ahead 2-1.	Utley led off the sixth with his second home run of the Series and the slumping Howard followed with a drive into the right-field seats.	Garza, who beat Boston in Game 7 to win the MVP award of the ALCS, never seemed comfortable and kept fidgeting with the rubber.	Jimmy Rollins got his first hit of the Series, leading off the first with a single. He later scored on Utley's groundout.	Crawford doubled off the sliding Pat Burrell's glove in left field in the second and scored on Gross' sacrifice fly.	Game notes	 The previous latest starting time in the Series was 9:24 p.m. in 1993, also at Philadelphia, after a 72-minute rain delay. ... Phillies Hall of Famer Steve Carlton threw out the ceremonial first ball. In Moyer's major league debut with the Chicago Cubs in 1986, he beat Carlton.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

PHILADELPHIA --  Ryan Howard knows this place will go nuts with one more win.	"It will be absolute bedlam," he said. "It will be one of the craziest places on earth. It's kind of scary to imagine."	Then again, who would've guessed Phillies pitcher Joe Blanton would shut his eyes, take a huge swing and sock a ball into the seats?	Blanton became the first pitcher in 34 years to homer in the World Series, Howard drove in five runs with two homers and Philadelphia romped over the Tampa Bay Rays 10-2 on Sunday night to move within one win of its first title since 1980.	The team of 10,000 losses could give title-starved Philadelphia its first champion in any of the four big sports since the NBA's 76ers in 1983.	"A championship is the only way to fully reverse that thought of how the Phillies are portrayed," said Jimmy Rollins, who sparked the Phillies with three hits and three runs. "If we get that game, I believe we will be happy, the city will be happy, there will be a big parade."	Jayson Werth also homered as the Phillies took a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven Series and thrilled their frustrated, long-suffering fans.	"I didn't really buy into the whole thing about the city and the drought and all that kind of stuff," Howard said.	Cole Hamels will try to close out the Phillies' second Series title on Monday night against Scott Kazmir in a rematch of Game 1 starters. Hamels (4-0) is trying to become the first pitcher to win five postseason starts in one year.	Of the 42 teams to take 3-1 World Series leads, 36 have gone on to win the crown. After splitting the first two games in Florida, the Phillies improved to 6-0 at Citizens Bank Park this postseason. That includes a wacky, rain-delayed 5-4 win in Game 3 that ended at 1:47 a.m. Sunday.	"Cole looks for these moments. I call him Hollywood, because when the lights are on, that's when he's at his best," Rollins said. "And tomorrow night, the lights will definitely be on."	Rollins made a great escape from a rundown in the first inning -- perhaps with the help of an umpire's blown call -- energizing the Phillies and rattling the Rays.	A day after hitting his first homer of the Series, Howard connected twice. The major league leader in homers and RBIs hit a three-run drive off Andy Sonnanstine that made it 5-1 in the fourth and sent screams through a whooped-up crowd of 45,903. Howard added a long, two-run shot against Dan Wheeler in the eighth.	Blanton, with a Greg Luzinski body type that's a throwback to an era of pudgy pitchers, gave up four hits -- including solo homers to Carl Crawford and pinch-hitter Eric Hinske -- struck out seven and walked two in six-plus innings.	Just 2-for-33 (.061) with one RBI in his career to that point, Blanton homered in the fifth off Edwin Jackson. It was just the 15th home run by a pitcher in the Series, and the first since Oakland's Ken Holtzman in 1974. No NL pitcher had homered since the Cardinals' Bob Gibson in 1968.	"I just close my eyes and swing hard in case I make contact," said Blanton, who thought he hadn't homered since high school. "Better to be lucky than good, I guess."	Even when Jason Bartlett's grounder up the middle caromed off him in the fifth, the ball went straight to third, where Pedro Feliz threw to first for the out. The pinball wizard defense was fitting -- The Who gave a concert across the street at the Wachovia Center on Sunday night.	Rays manager Joe Maddon came out midgame to complain to plate umpire Tom Hallion about a spot on Blanton's cap.	"It was rather dark," Maddon said. "I was concerned about that early on."	Blanton pleaded not guilty.	"They rub the balls up with whatever they rub them up with, and you rub it up and get it on your hand," he said. "It's nothing sticky. Anybody can go touch it. It's just basically just dirt from the ball."	The middle of Tampa Bay's lineup kept fizzling as if it had been zapped by a Ray-gun, with No. 3 hitter Carlos Pena and cleanup man Evan Longoria combining to go an A-Rod-like 0-for-29 with 15 strikeouts in the Series.	"My plan is to just keep swinging," Longoria said.	Second baseman Akinori Iwamura made two errors that led to unearned runs, and a frustrated Longoria -- again taunted by chants of "E-va! E-va!" in reference to the actress of the same last name -- struck out three times and swiped a hand through the air when a call went against him at third base.	"We know what's going on, we're just not reacting very well yet, but there is time," Maddon said. "We have to not give them four outs in an inning. We have to have better at-bats."	Had the Phillies come up with more timely hits -- a familiar story -- Philadelphia could have blown open the game earlier. The Phillies were 4-for-14 with runners in scoring position and are 6-for-47 in the Series.	Sonnanstine struggled with his offspeed stuff and needed 89 pitches to get through four innings. He allowed five runs -- three earned -- six hits and three walks.	After Rollins escaped the rundown in the first -- umpire Tim Welke signaled safe, although Longoria appeared to swipe him on the backside -- Pat Burrell walked on five pitches, forcing home the first run. Before that, Sonnanstine had never walked a batter in 18 career situations with bases loaded. Chase Utley reached leading off the second when Iwamura allowed his leadoff grounder to bounce off him for an error and scored with two outs on a single by Feliz, just the third hit for the Phillies in 40 at-bats with runners in scoring position in the Series.	Crawford's homer cut it to 2-1 in the fourth, but Rollins reached on another error by Iwamura starting the bottom half, when his grounder rolled under the second baseman's glove in the hole near first base. Werth walked and, one out later, Howard drove a 72 mph pitch into the lower deck in left for a 5-1 lead. Howard had been 0-for-6 with five strikeouts in the much-focused on runners in scoring position stat.	Tampa Bay never recovered.	"It's win or go home. It's simple, and no one in here wants to go home and wonder what if," Cliff Floyd said.	Game notes	 If the Phillies win Monday, it would mark the first time the Series has gone five straight years without reaching a Game 6. The only other four-year stretch without a Game 6 was 1913-16. ... Lenny Dykstra (1993) is the only other Phillies player with a multihomer Series game. ... With 25 postseason homers, the Rays trail only San Francisco (27 in 2002) for most in one postseason.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

PHILADELPHIA --  Save the jokes, the taunts and all those insults about the losingest team in sports.	The Philadelphia Phillies just won themselves a World Series.	If that sounds strange, it was strange.	Nearly 50 hours after Game 5 started but was stopped by rain, Brad Lidge and the Phillies finished off the Tampa Bay Rays 4-3 in a three-inning sprint Wednesday night.	"It was a crazy way to win it with a suspended game, but we did and it's over," 45-year-old Phillies pitcher Jamie Moyer said. "It has been a long wait, but it's worth it."	Left in limbo by a two-day storm, the Phillies seesawed to their first championship since 1980. Pedro Feliz singled home the go-ahead run in the seventh and Lidge closed out his perfect season to deliver the title Philly craved for so long.	Cheesesteaks, on the house.	"Who's the world champion?" manager Charlie Manuel asked the gleeful crowd during a 90-minute postgame ceremony that lasted longer than Wednesday night's action.	White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said that President Bush talked to David Montgomery, the Phillies' president, on Thursday morning. She said he "offered his congratulations and said how exciting it must be for him, the team, and for all of the fans."	Perino said that Bush also noted that Manuel had brought some of the players by the White House last year, and said he was "really impressed" by them. She said Bush asked Montgomery "to give Charlie and the entire organization his best."	Bundled in parkas and blankets, fans returned in force to Citizens Bank Park and saw the city claim its first major sports championship in 25 years. No more references needed to those sad-sack Phillies teams in the past and their 10,000-plus losses.	"They could taste it just as much as we could," Series MVP Cole Hamels said.	It was among the wackiest endings in baseball history, a best-of-seven series turned into a best-of-3 1/2 showdown when play resumed in the bottom of the sixth inning tied at 2.	How bizarre? Hamels was a star in Game 5 -- and the ace never stepped on the mound Wednesday night; Two Rays relievers warmed up to start, and there was a pinch-hitter before a single pitch; "God Bless America" was sung rather than the national anthem, and it was quickly followed by the seventh-inning stretch.	All because the game was suspended Monday night after rain made the field into a quagmire, washing out the foul lines, creating a puddle at home plate and turning every ball an adventure. Commissioner Bud Selig eventually called it -- fans booed loudly when he presented the MVP trophy to Hamels.	For Philly, it was more than a World Series win. Got the whole city off the hook, actually.	Finally, long after Julius Erving led the Sixers to the 1983 NBA title, something to celebrate.	How much did Philly fans want a champion to call their own?	Well, the sports hero they point to with the most pride isn't even a real person -- Rocky Balboa.	Yo, Adrian ... the Phillies did it!	"It's over," shortstop Jimmy Rollins said. "It's over, man."	Lidge went 48-for-48 on save chances this year, including two this week. He retired two batters with a runner on second, striking out pinch-hitter Eric Hinske to end it.	Lidge jumped in front of the mound, landing on his knees with arms outstretched. Catcher Carlos Ruiz ran out to grab him, and teammates sprinted to the mound to join them as towel-waving fans let loose.	"At first, I couldn't believe it. And then the gravity of what happened hit me," Lidge said.	A generation ago, it was Tug McGraw who went wild when the Phillies won their first title. A few days after country singer Tim McGraw scattered his dad's ashes on the mound, it was Lidge's turn to throw the final pitch.	Popular broadcaster Harry Kalas, in his fourth decade of doing Phillies games, serenaded the festive fans with a chorus of "High Hopes."	Despite low TV ratings and minus the majors' most glamorous teams, fans will always remember how this one wrapped up. And for the first time in a long while, kids saw a World Series champion crowned before bedtime.	"I believe this firmly, our guys are not going to be satisfied without playing in October from now on," Rays manager Joe Maddon said. "And that's a good thing. And that's all because of this group of people this year."	Reliever J.C. Romero got the win, his second of the Series.	Hamels went 4-0 in five postseason starts, beating the Rays in Game 1 and pitching six sharp innings in the rain during Game 5. He was set to be the first batter when the game resumed, and was immediately pulled for a pinch-hitter.	While former NL MVPs Ryan Howard and Rollins drive the Phillies, it was their less-heralded teammates who helped win it on this chilly night.	Tied at 3, Pat Burrell led off the seventh with a drive off the center-field wall against J.P. Howell. Chad Bradford relieved and one out later Feliz singled home pinch-runner Eric Bruntlett.	Rocco Baldelli's solo home run off Ryan Madson made it 3-all in the top of the seventh. The Rays almost got more, but All-Star second baseman Chase Utley alertly bluffed a throw to first on a grounder over the bag and instead threw out Jason Bartlett at the plate.	Pinch-hitter Geoff Jenkins, the first batter Wednesday night, doubled and later scored on Jayson Werth's bloop single.	In all, there were six new pitchers, three pinch-hitters and two pinch-runners when play restarted.	Manuel, whose NL East champions clinched a playoff spot in the final week, guided the Phillies' second overall championship in six World Series tries. The Phils helped themselves by going 7-0 at home this postseason, beating Milwaukee and the Dodgers in the NL playoffs and then defeating the Rays.	"I always thought we'd win the World Series. I knew we could beat anyone in the league," Manuel said.	Once known as a city of champions, Philadelphia saw its sports teams fall on hard times after Erving and Moses Malone led the Sixers to that 1983 title.	Since then, the Phillies, Eagles, Sixers and Flyers made it to the championship game or round -- seven times, in total -- and lost all of them.	The city became so starved for a crown that it was ready to throw a parade down Broad Street for a horse. But local colt Smarty Jones lost, too, in his bid for the Triple Crown.	Now, all those people can gather for the celebration Friday -- it's Halloween, and fans can dress up as champions for Halloween.	"People enjoy being associated with winning and a world championship is the ultimate," Mike Schmidt, MVP of the Phillies' other championship, wrote in an e-mail to The Associated Press this week. "It unites a town behind one team."	Tampa Bay did itself proud, too, until this final week. Baseball's best success story this season, the worst-to-first Rays played like the downtrodden Devil Rays from the past decade.	Even so, the gap between the Phils and Rays wasn't enormous. Had Evan Longoria's late, long drive off Moyer in Game 3 not been blown back by the wind, the teams might still be playing.
