ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- — Brandon Lowe is finding his form heading into the All-Star break.	Lowe homered twice and Mike Zunino also connected, helping the Tampa Bay Rays beat the Toronto Blue Jays 5-2 on Saturday for their sixth consecutive win.	Ryan Yarbrough (6-3) pitched five innings of two-run ball, improving to 5-0 in his last 12 appearances. The left-hander is 8-1 in 16 appearances against Toronto.	Matt Wisler (one hit in 1 2/3 innings) and Pete Fairbanks (1 1/3 innings) combined for three innings before Diego Castillo finished the six-hitter for his 13th save. Rays relievers have given up two hits over 16 scoreless innings in the past three games.	Lowe has four career multihomer games, including May 21 against the Blue Jays.	“B-Lowe is really turning his season around,” Rays manager Kevin Cash said.	After hitting under .200 for a large part of the season, Lowe went 2 for 3 and raised his average to .208.	Marcus Semien hit his 22nd homer for the Blue Jays, who have lost four of five.	“Anytime he is at the plate he's got a chance to hit one out,” Toronto manager Charlie Montoyo said. “He's got power to all fields so that's been fun for me to watch.”	Toronto led 2-1 before Tampa Bay scored three times in the third. Zunino led off the inning with his 19th homer. Kevin Kiermaier then doubled and Lowe made it 4-2 with a two-run shot off Ross Stripling (3-5).	Lowe opened the scoring with his 19th homer, connecting on the first pitch leading off the first. He has gone deep six times over his last eight games.	“I feel normal,” Lowe said. “I don't think that I'm on a tear or hot as I can be, I definitely feel better at the plate. Hopefully keep trending in the right direction.”	Randy Arozarena added an eighth-inning RBI single for the Rays.	Semien's two-run shot off Yarbrough gave the Blue Jays a 2-1 lead in the third.	“He competed with what he had,” Cash said of Yarbrough, who threw 104 pitches. “I don't think it was coming easy for him the first couple innings. Give Yarbs a ton of credit just for fighting through some of the stuff.”	Toronto had runners on the corners with two outs in the first when Zunino, an All-Star catcher, picked Vladimir Guerrero Jr. off first base.	Stripling allowed four runs and four hits in 3 2/3 innings. The right-hander had allowed 12 earned runs over 46 innings in his previous eight appearances.	“Today he didn't have his best stuff,” Montoyo said. “That's going to happen.”	ALL STAR SPECIAL SESSION	Rays infielder Joey Wendle found out after a 7-1 win over Toronto on Friday night that he was being added to the AL All Star team.	Cash surprisingly called a postgame meeting.	“Got everybody together after the game and just told the guys, he said ‘Hey, Mike Trout was selected for the All-Star Game but he can’t come so they wanted the next best player in the league, Joey Wendle,’” Wendle said. “It was pretty fun.”	It is Wendle’s first All-Star selection.	LONG RUNS	Blue Jays shortstop Bo Bichette tracked down Austin Meadows' first-inning foul ball near the third-base wall in front of the bullpen after starting in a defensive shift position. He nearly duplicated the feat on Meadows in the third on a foul in the bullpen area.	NUMBERS	The Rays are a majors-best 34-17, including 21-4 at home, since May 13. … Tampa Bay has allowed three or fewer runs an AL-leading 50 times.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Blue Jays: LHP Ryan Borucki (left forearm flexor strain) was scheduled to make his second appearance Saturday with Triple-A Buffalo. He may have another minor league outing on Tuesday.	Rays: RHP Chris Archer (right forearm tightness) will start a rehab assignment Monday with Florida Complex League Rays. … RHP Nick Anderson (right elbow strain) had a bullpen session and remains on target to return next month.	UP NEXT	Toronto LHP Robbie Ray (6-4) and Rays LHP Rich Hill (6-3) are Sunday’s starters.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

MINNEAPOLIS -- — Jorge Polanco hit a go-ahead three-run homer in the seventh inning and the Minnesota Twins rallied from a four-run deficit to beat the Detroit Tigers 9-4 Saturday.	Alex Kirilloff also homered for Minnesota to put the Twins on the board in the sixth. Luis Arraez drove in two insurance runs with an eighth-inning single.	“We play hard," Arraez said. "That’s why we won the game today."	The Twins have won the first three games of the series against the Tigers, with one remaining before the All-Star break.	For the second straight day, it took until the sixth inning for Minnesota to get on the scoreboard against Detroit. The Twins had a four-run sixth on Friday, then on Saturday they scored two in the sixth, three in the seventh and four in the eighth.	“It’s a beautiful thing when you stay at it and you continue to have the at-bats you’re looking for and you put some runs across the board,” Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. “There’s different ways to do it. Today, we went deep and brought some runs in and made it happen.”	After Andrelton Simmons snapped an 0-for-19 slump with a base hit and Arraez followed with a single, Polanco took reliever Joe Jimenez (2-1) deep to right to give Minnesota a 5-4 lead in the seventh.	Detroit threatened in the eighth with the tying run on third and one out, but Twins reliever Alex Colomé struck out Eric Haase and Jeimer Candelario to escape the jam.	“That would have changed the game more than necessarily even the Jimenez homer,” Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said of the eighth inning. “The back half of this game was a mess. We didn’t do a lot right.”	Kyle Funkhouser started Saturday’s bullpen game for the Tigers. Funkhouser gave up just two first-inning singles in 2 1/3 innings of work. Detroit used seven total pitchers Saturday.	Niko Goodrum and Zack Short hit back-to-back solo homers in the second inning off Twins starter Bailey Ober to put Detroit up 2-0. It was the third time this year the Tigers have gone back-to-back.	Ober surrendered four runs in just 3 1/3 innings, matching the shortest of his eight starts in his debut season. Danny Coloumbe (1-0) earned his first win since 2018 with 1 1/3 scoreless innings of relief.	Nelson Cruz stole his second base of the year. It’s the first time since 2016 that the veteran slugger stole multiple bases in a season.	GETTING HITCHED	Twins manager Rocco Baldelli has big plans for next week’s All-Star break: he’s getting married.	Baldelli and his fiance, Allie, will tie the knot on Tuesday in a small ceremony. He said the couple has plans for a bigger celebration eventually, possibly during the offseason.	“We’ve been together a long time,” Baldelli said. “I probably should have been on this and gotten this done a little while ago, but it’ll be great.”	TRAINERS ROOM	Tigers: RF Nomar Mazara was scratched from the lineup Saturday after feeling under the weather. He was replaced in the lineup by SS Zack Short, with Niko Goodrum moving from shortstop to the outfield.	Twins: Baldelli said C Mitch Garver is “meeting some thresholds” as he works his way back from a groin contusion. Garver remains on track to join Triple-A St. Paul next week to begin a rehab assignment.	UP NEXT	RHP José Berríos (7-3, 3.36 ERA) will get the start for Minnesota in Sunday’s series finale. Berríos allowed just one earned run and struck out 10 in seven innings his last time out in a loss against the White Sox. Detroit will counter with RHP Wily Peralta (2-1, 2.14 ERA), who is making his fifth start of the year. Peralta threw seven scoreless innings against Texas in his most recent start.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BALTIMORE -- — Brian Goodwin matched a career high with four hits, including a solo homer, and drove in three runs as the Chicago White Sox beat the Baltimore Orioles 8-3 Saturday for their fourth straight win.	Chicago has won nine of its last 12 and has taken seven in a row from the Orioles dating to 2019, its longest streak against Baltimore since winning eight straight in 1989-90. The White Sox have outscored the Orioles 38-11 in six games this season.	Goodwin hit cleanup for the sixth consecutive game after drawing three starts there in his first 375 career appearances. He’s fit splendidly with the White Sox --- regardless of his spot in the order --- since his call-up last month.	“It’s really simple,” said Goodwin, who was released by Pittsburgh May 3 and signed with the White Sox a day later. “When you take one look at the lineup and look at the guys on the scorecard, you know what they bring to the table. We have a good lineup. Looking one through nine, it’s a lot of hitters in there. Just having confidence in them and them having confidence in me, it never feels like I have to do too much. I can just be myself.”	Baltimore has lost three in a row and is 1-6 in July.	Lucas Giolito (7-6) struck out nine while allowing two runs in 5 1/3 innings to beat the Orioles for the second time this season.	Liam Hendriks struck out Ryan McKenna on three pitches upon entering in the eighth to escape a bases-loaded jam, then worked a perfect ninth for his AL-leading 23rd save.	Goodwin homered in the second, and the White Sox did more damage against Baltimore starter Thomas Eshelman (0-2) the following inning. Jake Burger lined a comebacker off the inside of Eshelman’s left shin to lead off, though the pitcher remained in the game --- though not for long.	After a walk, freshly minted All-Star Tim Anderson doubled in a run and Yoán Moncada followed with a two-run double. Eshelman’s day ended after another walk. He gave up four runs in two-plus innings and has not completed five innings in any of his five starts.	“It kind of swelled up on me after the last batter I walked a little bit,” Eshelman said. “I just wanted to grind through it and hopefully get through the third and give the bullpen a break.”	Goodwin’s RBI single and Leury García’s run-scoring double in the fifth bumped the White Sox lead to 6-1. Goodwin singled in a run against a drawn-in infield in the seventh, then scored on another double by García.	“I’ve seen guys get 100 RBI and hit less than 10 home runs,” manager Tony La Russa said of Goodwin. “He’s got some power, as he’s shown. He hit a home run today. He hits rights well and hangs in there against lefts. He’s done an outstanding job for us, no matter where he hits.”	Domingo Leyba had RBI singles in the fourth and sixth for Baltimore.	TRAINER’S ROOM	White Sox: La Russa said he is optimistic LHP Aaron Bummer (strained right hamstring) should be ready to come off the injured list Friday against Houston. Bummer hasn’t pitched since June 27. … OF Eloy Jiménez (left pectoral) homered Saturday for Class A Winston-Salem in his first rehabilitation assignment game.	Orioles: Manager Brandon Hyde said LHP John Means (shoulder strain) will make his next rehab appearance next week for Triple-A Norfolk after allowing four runs (two earned) in three innings Friday at Double-A Bowie. “He said he threw the ball well and he made a couple mistakes and they hit them for homers,” Hyde said. “But besides that, he’s healthy and ready to make his next start.”	SEEING STARS	Anderson was named to the American League all-star team, replacing Houston shortstop Carlos Correa. Anderson, who is making his first All-Star appearance, joins pitchers Lance Lynn, Carlos Rodón and Hendriks representing the AL Central-leading White Sox on Tuesday in Denver.	GATHERING CROWDS	Baltimore announced a crowd of 26,391, its largest attendance since drawing 26,998 on June 29, 2019. The Orioles’ previous season high was 14,917 on June 20.	UP NEXT	White Sox: RHP Dylan Cease (7-4, 4.14 ERA) gave up one run in six innings while striking 10 on May 27 in his lone career outing against Baltimore.	Orioles: RHP Spenser Watkins (1-0, 1.50) is coming off his first career victory after allowing a run in five innings Tuesday against Toronto.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- — Jed Lowrie hit a tiebreaking RBI single in the 11th inning after an earlier home run and the Oakland Athletics went on to beat the Texas Rangers 8-4 on Saturday.	“Ride the wave,” Lowrie said. “We had a big inning, and I think that was good for everybody in the dugout.”	Lowrie singled to right with one out in the 11th off Spencer Patton (0-1), who then threw a wild pitch that allowed another run before Stephen Piscotty added a two-run homer.	After both teams scored a run in the 10th, the A’s won for only the third time in their last nine games. They have to win the rubber game Sunday to avoid going winless in their last seven series before the All-Star break.	The A's had their most runs since a 13-6 win at Texas on June 22. The five runs just in extra innings were more than they scored in eight of their previous 10 games.	“We got some big hits that we’ve been missing here recently,” manger Bob Melvin said.	J.B. Wendelken (2-1), the sixth Oakland pitcher, worked both extra innings.	There were five solo homers before the game went to extra innings, with both teams having back-to-back shots.	“It seemed like every ball that was hit in the air was a homer early on,” Rangers manager Chris Woodward said. “We had our opportunities. We couldn't get the big hit to win it."	Texas led 2-0 when All-Star sluggers Adolis Garcia and Joey Gallo homered in a span of three pitches in the first. Garcia hit his 22nd homer and Gallo his 24th, the 11th in 12 games for the right fielder who will participate in MLB’s Home Run Derby on Monday night.	Sean Murphy and Seth Brown went back-to-back in the A's second. Murphy hit a 438-foot homer into the second deck of seats in left-center, then Brown followed with one that went even farther — 472 feet over the Texas bullpen in right-center, the longest ever hit at Globe Life Field.	“Obviously the home runs makes you feel a little bit better about yourself, because that’s typically what we do from time to time," Melvin said.	Lowrie went deep in the fourth for a 3-2 lead. The Rangers got even in the eighth when Jake Diekman, the third Oakland reliever, walked two batters before Jonah Heim’s RBI single.	Elvis Andrus, who started the second extra frame at second base, came home on Lowrie's third hit of the game before Matt Olson, who walked leading off the inning, scored on the wild pitch. Piscotty hit his fifth homer, his first since May 14.	Piscotty pinch-hit and reached leading off the 10th, with Murphy going to third, when Nick Solak misplayed a grounder for his first error since April 13. That ended his 71-game errorless streak that was the longest ever by a Rangers second baseman. Ramon Laureano  had an two-out RBI infield single, and Texas got even on an RBI grounder by Heim.	SHORT HOPS	Oakland is 4-3 in extra innings; Texas is 7-6. ... The blast by Brown surpassed a 464-footer by Murphy last September, and came three days after Gallo hit one 462 feet for what is now the third-longest in the stadium that opened last season. ... The only runs allowed by the starting pitchers were via solo homers. Oakland rookie right-hander James Kaprielian, who had been ill for a couple of days, left with a 3-2 lead after four strikeouts and four walks in five innings. Mike Foltynewicz struck out six without a walk over 6 1/3 innings but all five hits allowed were for extra bases (three homers, two doubles).	DERBY PREP	Gallo did some practice for the Home Run Derby before the game with Tony Beasley throwing to him in the same setup that will be used Monday night, a three-minute round with a catcher behind the plate and no batting cage. That session was planned, but led to an impromptu segment by A’s 1B Matt Olson. Olson took some swings from assistant hitting coach A’s Eric Martins, who will throw to him in Denver.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Athletics: RHP Mike Fiers (sprained right elbow) is still not comfortable throwing and isn’t yet playing catch again. “Still having problems,” manager Bob Melvin said. Fiers last pitched May 6, and had an injection in his elbow 2 1/2 weeks ago after feeling discomfort when he first tried to resume throwing.	UP NEXT	Oakland right-hander Chris Bassitt (9-2, 3.04 ERA), a first-time All-Star after being added to the AL team Saturday, starts the series finale. He is 9-0 over his last 16 starts for the longest winning streak in the majors this season, and that includes consecutive wins over Texas in late June when he allowed one run over 14 innings. Texas lefty Kolby Allard (2-5, 3.45) is 1-5 in his seven starts since moving into the rotation May 27, and the Rangers have scored a total of five runs in those losses.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN FRANCISCO -- — All-Star Brandon Crawford had three hits, including his 18th home run, and the San Francisco Giants ensured themselves the best record in baseball at the break by thumping the Washington Nationals 10-4 on Saturday.	Anthony DeSclafani had six strikeouts and pitched three-hit ball over six scoreless innings to win his 10th for the Giants. Thairo Estrada added four hits and two RBI. Darin Ruf doubled and scored twice.	San Francisco is 56-32, assured of the major leagues' top record at the All-Star break in a season when it was expected to lag behind the Padres and Dodgers.	“So far in this series we’ve fought for every pitch,” San Francisco manager Gabe Kapler said. “That’s a huge factor, and we’re not letting our foot off the gas at any point. That’s also important.”	Named to his third All-Star team last week, Crawford had a sacrifice fly in the first inning, singled in a run as part of San Francisco’s five-run third, doubled in the fourth and homered off Kyle McGowin in the sixth.	The 18 home runs by Crawford ties Jose Valentin’s mark for most before the All-Star break by a shortstop 34 years or older. Crawford’s career high for home runs in a season is 21.	“We all feel good as a team,” Crawford said. “We feel good about being in first place. What we’ve done a really good job of is going game by game and not worrying about other teams. Just focusing on what we need to do as a team to win games.”	DeSclafani (10-3) walked one and only allowed two runners past first base while setting a career high for wins. DeSclafani got Juan Soto to strike out looking twice and got help from right fielder Mike Yastrzemski, who made a sliding catch in foul territory to end the sixth.	Washington’s Starlin Castro singled to extend his hitting streak to 13 games. Alcides Escobar added a two-run triple.	The Giants batted around twice in the first three innings to chase starter Jon Lester (2-4).	“It was tough but his pitch count got way up there.” Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. “We had to do something. He’s definitely frustrated. I believe in him, we all believe in him. We need him.”	Lester had won five of his six career starts against the Giants before Saturday. The five-time All-Star retired eight batters and allowed nine hits and eight runs — three earned. It’s the second time in his last four starts that Lester failed to make it out of the third.	“Kind of the same song and dance as the last couple here,” Lester said. “Seems like I can’t minimize the bad. I’m OK with the hits and runs but when it’s consistently two and three innings, it’s putting the team in a bad position.”	WILD FIRST	The Giants scored three unearned runs in the first after left fielder Gerardo Parra dropped Ruf’s deep fly ball. San Francisco batted around and had three infield singles, including one by Joey Bart, who hit a line drive that Lester fielded between his legs but couldn’t hold on to.	“We were especially fortunate in the first couple of innings,” Kapler said. “I’d also say we smoked some balls that on other days may have been home runs. Early in the game the air felt a little dead.”	ROSTER MOVES	Bart went 2 for 5 after being called up from Triple-A Sacramento by the Giants. RHP Logan Webb was optioned to the River Cats. Webb started for San Francisco on Friday after a lengthy stay on the injured list.	Washington called up Jakson Reetz from Triple-A Rochester after Yan Gomes was put on the IL. Reetz doubled in the ninth for his first major league hit. Kyle Lobstein was designated for assignment. Lobstein had a 20.25 ERA in three games as a reliever with the Nationals.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Nationals: Gomes had an MRI on Saturday after coming out of Friday night’s game because of the injury.	UP NEXT	Right-handers Kevin Gausman (8-3, 1.74 ERA) of the Giants and Erick Fedde (4-5, 4.53) of the Nationals face off the second time this season in the series finale Sunday. Gausman, San Francisco’s All-Star ace, suffered his first loss of the season in the first matchup on June 12.	----	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MIAMI -- — Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. will have season-ending surgery to repair a completely torn ACL in his right knee after he was injured during Atlanta's 5-4 win over the Miami Marlins on Saturday.	An MRI showed the severity of the injury and the Braves made the announcement shortly before midnight that their three-time All-Star will be out until at least next year.	Acuña landed awkwardly on his right leg after jumping on the warning track in right field to try to catch a drive from Jazz Chisholm Jr. in the fifth inning. The 23-year-old slammed into the outfield wall and crumbled on the warning track, immediately grabbing his right knee while Chisholm sprinted out an inside-the-park homer.	Acuña tried to walk off but dropped back to the ground in shallow right field. A trainer tended to him while a cart was retrieved, and concerned teammates gathered quietly around him.	Tears welled in his eyes as he waited. When the cart pulled around to the nearby warning track, he had to be helped over and did not put any weight on his right leg.	Braves manager Brian Snitker said immediately after the game that Acuña was undergoing evaluation and the team didn't expect to have news until Sunday morning.	“He’s in a lot of pain, I can tell you that. It’s a tough break for the team and for him,” he said.	Max Fried gave up three straight hits but settled down to retire the side with two strikeouts after the injury.	“You never like to see one of your teammates come up injured after trying to make a great play,” Fried said. “It’s obviously very unfortunate, but you have to stay with the task at hand and finish the game.”	Chisholm at first thought Acuña was going to make the catch and didn’t realize the severity of the injury until after he crossed home plate.	“A guy like that, him getting injured, the baseball world is going to miss him if he’s out for a long time,” Chisholm said. “Hopefully he gets better.”	Acuña was slated to start in the outfield for the NL All-Star team in Tuesday’s game. He is hitting .283 with 24 home runs and 52 RBI for the three-time defending NL East champions, who started the day in second place behind the New York Mets.	Freddie Freeman had a two-run homer and an RBI single, while Dansby Swanson and Austin Riley ripped doubles as the first three Braves reached base off All-Star pitcher Trevor Rogers (7-6) in the fourth inning. Atlanta has won three straight over Miami.	Acuña doubled in the top of the fifth and scored on Freeman’s shot over the right-field wall.	Max Fried (6-5), who went five innings with five strikeouts while surrendering nine hits, had to compose himself quickly after the injury.	“I was just trying to find my rhythm again; it was huge being able to get those last two strikeouts,” Fried said. (The injury) is tough, but you have to get your focus back.”	Rogers lasted four innings and gave up three runs, two earned, while striking out four and walking two.	Rogers’ own miscue led to an unearned run in the third. After walking Jonathan Lucroy, the lefty threw wildly past first baseman Jesus Aguilar. Lucroy later raced home from second on Freeman’s single.	Prior to leaving the game in the fifth with mild intercostal soreness, Adam Duvall continued to be a nemesis to his former team. The Marlins slugger lined a two-out double in the first inning and followed that with a two-run single in the third.	The Marlins loaded the bases with one out after Acuña’s injury, but Fried struck out Jon Berti and Jorge Alfaro to maintain Atlanta’s two-run advantage. Miami left runners on second and third in the first inning, too.	Chisholm’s RBI single accounted for the Marlins’ final run in the ninth inning.	CAREER FIRST	Chisholm’s inside-the-park home run was not only the first of his career but the first by the Marlins since JT Riddle accomplished the feat on May 29, 2018 in San Diego. It was also the first for the Marlins at home since J.T. Realmuto on Sept. 8, 2015.	ROSTER MOVES	Marlins: LHP Shawn Morimando, who pitched five scoreless innings on Friday, was designated for assignment. RHP Preston Guilmet was recalled from Triple-A Jacksonville as a long-relief option.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Braves: C Travis d’Arnaud (torn ligaments in left thumb) continues to make strides and is swinging a bat with both hands, and RHP Huascar Ynoa is progressing with long tosses and will throw off the mound in a couple days.	UP NEXT	RHP Ian Anderson (5-4, 3-27) gets the start for the Braves, while the Marlins counter with RHP Pablo López (4-5, 2.94) in the finale for both teams prior to the All-Star break.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

BOSTON -- — Jean Segura and Alec Bohm homered, and the Philadelphia Phillies snapped Boston's nine-game home winning streak with an 11-2 victory over the Red Sox on Saturday.	Segura opened the game with a drive over the Green Monster, and Bohm made it 3-0 with a two-run shot against Martín Pérez (7-5) in the second. The Phillies then broke it open with eight runs in the eighth, earning their fourth win six games.	Segura finished with three hits and three RBI. Rhys Hoskins and Bryce Harper each hit a two-run double, and Bailey Falter (1-0) pitched two hitless innings for his first major league victory.	“We have everyone back, which is nice, and we had contributions from everyone up and down the lineup,” Phillies manager Joe Girardi said. “Two guys can't carry a team. When you score runs, it's nice.”	Xander Bogaerts hit a solo homer for Boston, which lost for just fourth time in 15 games. It was the team's longest win streak at Fenway Park since 2011.	After Sunday’s series finale, Boston will enter the All-Star break atop the AL East a year after posting its second-worst winning percentage in 88 years. The Red Sox were just 24-36 in last season’s pandemic-reduced season.	Segura's 10th career leadoff homer left the ballpark. Bohm's sixth homer of the season also went over the Monster, a drive that bounced off a billboard near the left-field foul pole and led to loud cheers of “Let’s Go Phillies!” from the right-field corner.	The Phillies can go into the break at .500 with a victory on Sunday.	“I can tell you what: It can feel a lot better than being two games below,” Hoskins said.	Ronald Torreyes had three hits for Philadelphia, including a run-scoring single in the eighth.	“To me what's most impressive is to hold them to two runs,” Girardi said. “That's not an offense that usually doesn't score runs.”	Red Sox reliever Josh Taylor's streak of scoreless appearances ended at 26 games.	“We haven’t seen that in a while, right?’” Red Sox manager Alex Cora said of the eighth. “We had the right guy on the mound. Hard to stop it right there, one bad inning.”	Taylor gave up four runs and recorded just one out.	“I wasn’t locating today. I was all around the zone," he said. "I’ve got to go back and watch video and figure it out.”	Bogaerts homered into the Monster seats in the second.	SHORT WORK	Pérez lasted just 3 2/3 innings, giving up three runs and six hits. Phillies starter Matt Moore went a bit longer, going 4 1/3 and allowing two runs.	OOPS!	Boston’s Alex Verdugo singled down the left-field line. As he was rounding first for a sure double, he stumbled to the ground and had to settle for an embarrassing single.	THAT’S GOTTA CHANGE	The Phillies’ starters have a 5.16 ERA on the road and a solid 3.06 mark in Citizens Bank Park.	PRACTICE IT	Boston second baseman Christian Arroyo was practicing turning double plays along with backup Michael Chavis nearly 90 minutes before the game. The first ball hit to Arroyo turned into a 4-6-3 DP for the first two outs of the game.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Phillies: RHP Sam Coonrod, on the injured list since June 24 with right forearm tendinitis, pitched off the mound about an hour before the game to Travis Jankowski, who was batting.	Red Sox: Placed RHP Matt Andriese on the 10-day injured list with a right hamstring injury and selected RHP Austin Brice from Triple-A Worcester.	UP NEXT	Phillies right-hander Aaron Nola (6-5, 4.53 ERA) is slated to face right-hander Nick Pivetta (7-3, 4.09) on Sunday. Pivetta struck out a season-high 10 in seven shutout innings in his last start Sunday in Oakland.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

NEW YORK -- — Tyler Anderson pitched five innings and helped himself with a tiebreaking homer, leading the Pittsburgh Pirates to a 6-2 victory over Marcus Stroman and the New York Mets on Saturday in the first game of a doubleheader.	All-Star Bryan Reynolds also connected as last-place Pittsburgh bounced back from a 13-4 loss in the opener of the four-game set on Friday. John Nogowski had two hits and two RBI.	Anderson (5-8) won consecutive starts for the second time this season, allowing two runs and six hits. He went winless in an eight-start span from May 15-June 28.	The game was tied at 2 when Anderson went deep with two out in the fifth, driving a 1-1 cutter from Stroman (6-7) over the wall in right-center. It was Anderson’s second career homer in 152 at-bats and first since July 9, 2016, for Colorado against Philadelphia.	“As soon as I hit it, I was hoping it got over the outfielder’s head,” Anderson said. “And then they were catching home runs earlier in the game. So, once it looked like it had a chance, I was hoping it wouldn’t get caught too.”	It was Pittsburgh’s first homer by a pitcher since Steven Brault on Sept. 1, 2019, and the first go-ahead homer by a Pirates pitcher since Gerrit Cole on Aug. 26, 2017.	“Really good swing,” Pittsburgh manager Derek Shelton said. “He got it out front, got it up in the air. Big swing at the time, 2-2 game, so yeah that was kind of cool to see.”	It also was the second game-winning RBI by a Pittsburgh pitcher this year. The Dodgers are the only other team with multiple game-winning RBI from pitchers.	Reynolds was robbed of a home run when Mets center fielder Brandon Nimmo made a terrific leaping catch at the wall in the first. But Reynolds easily cleared the fence in right-center on his two-run homer off Trevor May in the sixth.	“Bryan could have had two homers today, a really good play,” Shelton said. “But I give credit to our guys. We had a situation where we played a really close game for six innings last night and the game gets broken open. That happens in the first, Stro looked really good through three. We came right back.”	Nogowski continued his impressive start with the Pirates, hitting a two-run double in the fourth and a single in the sixth. He has 12 hits in five games since being acquired from St. Louis last weekend.	Ke’Bryan Hayes padded Pittsburgh’s lead with an RBI double in the sixth off Drew Smith.	Jonathan Villar homered for the Mets, who are playing their 10th doubleheader and third this week. Kevin Pillar had an RBI single.	Stroman lost his third straight decision. He was charged with three runs and five hits in five innings.	“I threw a slider that didn’t slide,” Stroman said of Anderson’s homer. “If I execute that pitch, he probably swings over it.”	Stroman retired his first nine hitters on 29 pitches. Adam Frazier got Pittsburgh’s first hit with a clean single to left and the Pirates had second and third for Nogowski, who doubled down the left-field line just past the diving attempt of Villar at third base.	TRAINER’S ROOM:	Mets: RHP Carlos Carrasco (strained right hamstring) threw three innings and about 30 pitches in a simulated game. Manager Luis Rojas was particularly impressed with Carrasco’s changeup and said he could start a rehab assignment next week. ... 3B/OF J.D. Davis (sprained left hand) is continuing his rehab assignment with Triple-A Syracuse and could rejoin the team next weekend.	UP NEXT	Max Kranick (1-0, 0.00 ERA) started the second game for Pittsburgh. Tylor Megill (0-0, 3.77 ERA) got the ball for New York.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CLEVELAND -- — César Hernández and Óscar Mercado each hit a three-run homer, and the Cleveland Indians beat the struggling Kansas City Royals 14-6 on Saturday night.	Hernández's 15th homer capped a six-run fourth inning against Mike Minor (6-8). Mercado's drive highlighted a four-run seventh that put the game away.	Cleveland staggered into the series on a nine-game losing streak, but won the first two games on ninth-inning homers by Franmil Reyes on Thursday and Bobby Bradley on Friday. The Indians have beaten the Royals eight straight times this season.	Mercado thinks the momentum from the back-to-back walk-off wins carried over into Saturday's game.	“That’ll light a fire in any ballclub,” he said. "Everyone wants to win, but just the fact that the last two nights you get to go out and win in walk-off fashion with home runs, that really just sets the tone and brings the energy life back into the clubhouse.”	The Royals have dropped 15 of 18 to fall a season-worst 17 games under .500. Salvador Pérez hit a two-run homer in the fourth, but the Royals' All-Star catcher was removed in the sixth with back tightness. Kansas City manager Mike Matheny said the tightness was the result of a diving play Pérez made catching a foul bunt in the third.	“It was aggravated, we'll get him in there and have (the trainers) take a look at him, but we're going to have to see how he feels tomorrow,” Matheny said.	Mercado had three hits and drove in four runs. José Ramírez and Roberto Pérez also homered for Cleveland, which totaled 17 hits.	Cal Quantrill (1-2), one of several pitchers trying to give Cleveland’s injury-riddled rotation a boost, allowed three runs in six innings.	Cleveland finally had success against Minor in the bottom half. Bradley hit an RBI double and Mercado’s run-scoring single tied the game. Bradley Zimmer’s hard grounder off Minor’s leg went for an RBI single.	Hernandez followed with a drive to left-center, giving Cleveland a 6-2 lead.	Minor had dominated the Indians in his career, going 3-0 and allowing four earned runs in 28 2/3 innings over nine appearances. The left-hander gave up six runs and nine hits in four innings.	Perez warmed up for his matchup in Monday’s All-Star Home Run Derby against Pete Alonso of the New York Mets with his 21st of the season. Alonso won the most recent derby in Cleveland in 2019.	Royals reliever Kyle Zimmer struck out his brother, Bradley, in the seventh in the first major league matchup between the two which came following Mercado's home run. Several members of the Zimmer family were at Progressive Field for the game.	“They were all here,” Bradley said. “I'm sure I'll hear all about it."	Kyle Zimmer was the fifth overall pick in 2012 while Bradley was the 21st overall pick in 2014. The two faced each other in a Triple-A game this season with Bradley getting a single. Bradley Zimmer said their parents have always looked forward to when then brothers would face off.	“They talk about it non-stop, and try to play out the scenarios of how it's going to happen,” he said. “I’m sure they’re beside themselves that it finally happened in the major leagues.”	BIEBER UPDATE	Indians manager Terry Francona said right-hander Shane Bieber felt some “crankiness” in his sore shoulder while throwing with weighted balls Friday.	“The hard part right now with it is, is the amount of work they do with their shoulder is obviously intense and a lot,” Francona said. “Then when you take some time off, some of the muscles can get a little cranky. So now you’re starting up again and it’s like OK what’s cranky — so trying to determine that. But then today he came in and he felt like he was gonna have a better day, which is good.”	Bieber, the reigning AL Cy Young Award winner, has been sidelined since June 14.	WHIT’S A STAR	Royals second baseman Whit Merrifield, who was voted in by the players ballot, will replace Jose Altuve in Tuesday’s All-Star Game in Denver.	“It’s an incredible honor to be voted in by my fellow players,” Merrifield said. “It means the most, frankly. The fan vote is great and we appreciate all the support we get from the fans but nobody knows what this game is like more than the players.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Royals: 1B Carlos Santana injured his left wrist in the first inning but remained in the game. Third baseman Hunter Dozier’s throw on a bunt hit pulled Santana into the path of Hernández. Santana was checked by a trainer.	UP NEXT	Rookie RHP Eli Morgan (1-3) will start the final game before the All-Star break for the Indians. RHP Carlos Hernández (1-0) will start for the Royals.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

NEW YORK -- — Pete Alonso homered, Jeff McNeil drove in two runs and the New York Mets beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-2 on Saturday night for a doubleheader split.	Alonso gave the Mets a 3-1 lead when he connected on a 1-1 fastball from Max Kranick (1-1) with two outs in the third inning. Alonso’s 428-foot solo drive hit a glass window on a club area just inside the left-field foul pole.	It was the 17th homer for Alonso, who is defending his All-Star Home Run Derby title on Monday night in Colorado. Alonso won the competition in 2019, and it was canceled last year because of the pandemic.	Alonso helped the Mets to the victory in front of 31,924 fans, the club’s largest home crowd since Sept. 28, 2019, when the first baseman hit his 53rd homer to break the rookie record set by Aaron Judge.	The Pirates won the opener 6-2 behind five innings and a tiebreaking homer by Tyler Anderson off Marcus Stroman.	New York got off to a fast start in the second game when McNeil hit a two-run double in the first. Billy McKinney added a pinch-hit RBI single in the sixth.	It was McNeil’s first extra-base hit since he doubled against Tyler Glasnow on May 14 at Tampa Bay. Before giving the Mets a 2-0 lead, McNeil’s previous 16 hits were singles.	“I think it’s just getting comfortable at the plate,” McNeil said. “I’m starting to see the ball better and my barrel awareness is back and I’ve been able to shoot some balls all over the field.”	The Mets played their 10th of 13 doubleheaders this season. It is their most doubleheaders since playing 13 in 1979.	New York is the first team to play at least 10 doubleheaders before the All-Star break since the Toronto Blue Jays in 1978.	All-Star Bryan Reynolds hit a two-run homer in the opener and an RBI single in the nightcap for the Pirates, who were trying to sweep a doubleheader from the Mets in New York for the first time since Sept. 10, 1969. Jacob Stallings connected for Pittsburgh in the second game.	Mets right-hander Tylor Megill allowed one run and four hits in 3 2/3 innings in the nightcap. Jeurys Familia (4-1) got the final out of the fourth, and Seth Lugo allowed Stallings’ homer in the sixth.	Edwin Díaz struck out the side in the seventh for his 19th save in 20 chances. He threw just 10 pitches.	“For me this is the best outing I’ve seen him have as a Met,” New York manager Luis Rojas said.	Kranick allowed three runs and four hits in three innings. He was Pittsburgh’s 27th man for the doubleheader and was optioned to Triple-A Indianapolis after the game.	In the opener, Anderson (5-8) won consecutive starts for the second time this season, allowing two runs and six hits. He went winless in an eight-start span from May 15-June 28.	The game was tied at 2 when Anderson went deep with two out in the fifth, driving a 1-1 cutter from Stroman (6-7) over the wall in right-center. It was Anderson’s second career homer in 152 at-bats and first since July 9, 2016, for Colorado against Philadelphia.	“As soon as I hit it, I was hoping it got over the outfielder’s head,” Anderson said. “And then they were catching home runs earlier in the game. So, once it looked like it had a chance, I was hoping it wouldn’t get caught too.”	It was Pittsburgh’s first homer by a pitcher since Steven Brault on Sept. 1, 2019, and the first go-ahead homer by a Pirates pitcher since Gerrit Cole on Aug. 26, 2017.	Reynolds was robbed of a home run when Mets center fielder Brandon Nimmo made a terrific leaping catch at the wall in the first. But Reynolds easily cleared the fence in right-center on his two-run homer off Trevor May in the sixth.	Jonathan Villar homered and Kevin Pillar hit an RBI single for the Mets in the opener.	Stroman lost his third straight decision. He was charged with three runs and five hits in five innings.	TRAINER’S ROOM:	Mets: RHP Carlos Carrasco (strained right hamstring) threw three innings and about 30 pitches in a simulated game. Rojas was particularly impressed with Carrasco’s changeup and said he could start a rehab assignment next week. ... 3B/OF J.D. Davis (sprained left hand) is continuing his rehab assignment with Triple-A Syracuse and could rejoin the team next weekend.	UP NEXT	RHP Chase De Jong (1-3, 5.08 ERA) starts Sunday for Pittsburgh.

MILWAUKEE -- — Eugenio Suárez hit a leadoff home run in the ninth inning against All-Star closer Josh Hader and the Cincinnati Reds beat the Milwaukee Brewers 4-3 Saturday night in a game that included three ejections.	Suárez hit a 2-0 pitch from Hader (3-1) into the second deck of the right-field bleachers for his 18th homer.	“It was a big moment for me and for the team,” Suárez said. “Big win, man, before the All-Star break. Everybody knows that Hader has a really good fastball. He's one of the best closers in the game. In my mind, I was like, 'don't let him beat you.'"	Prior to the go-ahead homer, Suárez was hitless in his previous 10 at-bats and is 3 for 38 (.079) against the Brewers in 2021.	“It was a game-winner,” Reds manager David Bell said. “And, it came against one of the best in the game.”	Heath Hembree took care of Milwaukee in the bottom half for his second consecutive save and sixth overall, helping the Reds pull within five games of the NL Central-leading Brewers.	Josh Osich (2-0) got one out in the eighth for the win.	Tyrone Taylor hit a two-run homer off Reds reliever Brad Brach in the eighth to tie it at 3.	Milwaukee starter Freddy Peralta, who will be replacing teammate Brandon Woodruff on the NL All-Star team, held Cincinnati hitless until All-Star Nick Castellanos connected in the sixth for his 18th homer, a three-run shot that made it 3-1.	Brewers manager Craig Counsell then came out to get Peralta and was ejected by plate umpire Gabe Morales for arguing about the 2-2 pitch to Castellanos.	“That was the pitch,” Counsell said about what got him tossed. “I feel like it's been a rough series for the umpires. So, yeah, there's a lot of guys upset, both teams.”	Counsell was ejected for the third time this season and for the 21st time overall.	Milwaukee star Christian Yelich was ejected by first base umpire John Libka in the bottom of the sixth after reaching on a wild throw by pitcher Vladimir Gutiérrez. Yelich turned toward second just enough that second baseman Jonathan India slapped a tag on him, Libka signaled out, and Yelich became irate, tossing his helmet.	“In the umpire's judgment, there was something,” Counsell said of Yelich's inadvertent twitch. “That's just a clear case of an umpire kind of making something up or thinking he sees something that has no influence on the game, and then making a call. It was a poor call, and it cost us a baserunner."	Third base umpire Doug Eddings ejected Joey Votto in top of the eighth after the Reds star struck out swinging.	Gutiérrez allowed one run on five hits in six solid innings.	This is the third of seven consecutive games between these divisional foes. They’re playing a four-game series in Milwaukee this week and meet the Reds again in a three-game series in Cincinnati immediately after the All-Star break.	The Brewers won the opener of this series 5-3 on Thursday. The Reds got a measure of revenge Friday thanks to Wade Miley and his 2-0 gem.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Reds: RHP Michael Lorenzen came out of his recent rehab start in good shape. Manager David Bell said that Lorenzen would stay with Triple-A Louisville, pitch on consecutive days and possibly be activated on Friday. He hasn’t pitched all season due to a right shoulder injury. … INF Mike Moustakas has made a slight improvement as he recovers from a right-heel injury.	Brewers: C Manny Piña got crossed up on a pitch and barehanded the ball in a freak play Friday night. He played through considerable pain and even managed to get a base hit. “It didn’t bother him catching or throwing,” Counsell said. “It was a little bothersome hitting. He’s going to be OK.”	REDS STATS	With tonight’s 4-3 win, the Reds have taken five of six games from the Brewers at American Family Field and lead the season series 7-5. They improve to 24-13 against NL Central opponents. Their 25 come from behind victories are third most in MLB, trailing only Boston (29) and Tampa Bay (26).	BREWERS MAKE IT THREE STRAIGHT	Catcher Omar Narváez joined Peralta as a first-time All-Star when it was announced before the game that Narváez was named as a replacement for the Cardinals’ Yadier Molina, who replaced the Giants’ Buster Posey.	With the late addition of Narváez, the Brewers now have a franchise record five All-Stars (pitchers Peralta, Woodruff, Hader and Corbin Burnes) for the third consecutive time (2018, 2019 and 2021).	UP NEXT	RHP Luis Castillo (3-10, 4.81 ERA) starts for the Reds and faces RHP Brandon Woodruff (7-4, 2.10 ERA) and the Brewers in the first-half finale for both teams.	------	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

HOUSTON -- — Two days ago, when a nasty illness had Gerrit Cole hooked up to an IV, New York Yankees manager Aaron Boone hardly imagined he'd get an earful from his ace as he campaigned to get the final out Saturday night against the Houston Astros.	Boone didn't even know if Cole would be able to make the start.	Not only did he start — he finished, spinning a three-hitter in a 1-0 victory over Houston.	Cole demanded on the mound that Boone let him get the final out, then struck out Yordan Alvarez with a 99 mph fastball on his career-high 129th pitch to cap victory.	“I said the f-word a lot and I kind of just blacked out," Cole said about the mound meeting. “I don’t really remember what I told him, to be honest."	Boone gave the edited version of the conversation and added that Alvarez would have been Cole's last hitter regardless of the outcome.	“He just wanted it," Boone said. “He was like, ‘Let’s go.'"	Aaron Judge hit a solo homer and Cole did the rest for his fifth career complete game and third shutout. His only other nine-inning shutout was May 4, 2018 against Arizona while he pitched for Houston.	“Probably one of the great ones I’ve ever seen, certainly in a regular-season setting," Boone said.	The AL West-leading Astros, who entered this series having been shut out just once all season, were blanked for a second straight game after losing 4-0 in the opener Friday night.	Houston manager Dusty Baker said Cole reminded him of a certain Hall of Famer as he closed it out.	“He reached back at the end," Baker said. “That was like Tom Seaver. At the end, he ditched the rest of his pitches and relied on his fastball, the high fastball."	Cole (9-4), who pitched for the Astros from 2018-2019, tied a season low in hits and struck out 12. His 129 pitches are the most in the majors this season, surpassing Trevor Bauer's 126, and the most since Oakland's Mike Fiers needed 131 in his no-hitter against Cincinnati on May 7, 2019.	Cole's performance came after he battled an unspecified illness this week that left him “miserable." When asked to provide details, he warned against it.	“You don’t want to know what I was going through," he said. “It was gross. Leave it at that."	Cole beat Houston for the first time in his third career try, giving him at least one win against every team in the majors.	All-Star closer Aroldis Chapman began warming for the Yankees during the eighth inning but never got in the game.	Jose Altuve singled to start the ninth for Houston, and Michael Brantley battled through a 10-pitch at-bat before flying out. Yuli Gurriel struck out on what he thought was a checked swing, and Boone visited the mound contemplating a pitching change with Cole at 126 pitches.	Cole berated Boone when he got to the mound, shouting that he wanted to face Alvarez. Boone relented, Cole punched out Alvarez on three pitches and then the Yankees All-Star let out an enormous holler.	“I just felt like he was our best chance to get through there at the end," Boone said.	There were two outs in the third when Judge connected off Zack Greinke (8-3) on his soaring shot to left field. The slugger then provided a bit of entertainment on his trip around the bases.	Judge pulled his jersey together with both hands as he rounded third. It was a gesture that some interpreted as a reference to Altuve gripping his jersey to keep teammates from ripping it off during the celebration after his game-ending homer in Game 6 of the 2019 AL Championship Series against the Yankees.	After Houston’s sign-stealing scandal was uncovered, some speculated that Altuve didn’t want his jersey pulled off because he was concealing a buzzer that helped in the plot. The allegation was never proven, and Altuve said he did it because he was shy and that he got in trouble with his wife when his jersey was ripped off before.	Judge, who finished second to Altuve in AL MVP voting in 2017, was asked if he was sending a message to the opposing dugout with the move.	“No, whenever they keep the roof closed here it’s a little chilly," he said with a smile. “I was just telling my teammates to button up a little bit."	When asked directly if he was referencing Altuve, he laughed and said: “Everyone’s welcome to their own opinion."	Cole bounced back after permitting four runs in 3 1/3 innings for his shortest start since 2016 against the Mets his last time out. That came after he yielded eight hits and six runs — both season highs — in five innings of a 9-2 loss to Boston on June 27.	Greinke lasted just four innings, allowing three hits and one run in his first loss since May 25, snapping a four-game winning streak. Baker said he pulled him early because of a sore right shoulder.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Yankees: Boone said LHP Zack Britton (left hamstring strain) is expected to be activated on Thursday after being out since June 26. ... INF/OF Miguel Andújar was placed on the 10-day injured list, retroactive to Wednesday, with a strained left wrist. ... RHP Jonathan Loaisiga was added to the injured list due to health and safety protocols. ... RHP Albert Abreu and RHP Booke Kriske were recalled from Triple-A Scranton-Wilkes-Barre to take Andújar and Loaisiga’s spots on the roster.	Astros: Baker said SS Carlos Correa, who was placed on the injured list due to health and safety protocols on Friday, was still ill on Saturday. “He’s not good,” Baker said. “He’s sick.” Baker said he didn’t have any other details about his illness but said that he was resting at home. ... 3B Alex Bregman (strained left quadriceps) took batting practice on the field Saturday and should be ready for a rehabilitation assignment next week.	UP NEXT	New York RHP Jameson Taillon (4-4, 5.05 ERA) will oppose LHP Framber Valdez (5-1, 2.86) when the Yankees look to complete the sweep Sunday.	------	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

CHICAGO -- — Paul Goldschmidt, Paul DeJong and Tommy Edman homered in the fifth inning, and the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Chicago Cubs 6-0 on Saturday night.	Kwang Hyun Kim struck out seven in six innings, helping St. Louis bounce back from Friday’s 10-5 loss in the series opener. The Cardinals had dropped four of six overall.	The sputtering Cubs lost for the 13th time in 15 games. Javier Báez had two of the team’s six hits.	“I feel like everybody was off,” Cubs catcher Willson Contreras said. “Everybody was distracted. I don’t know why, probably because the All-Star break is really close.”	The Cardinals homered off three pitchers during their five-run fifth inning.	Goldschmidt led off with his 13th homer, a drive to left against Zach Davies (5-6) that traveled an estimated 441 feet.	“I’ve had games here that have been good, and I’ve had games where they struck me out three times,” Goldschmidt said. “It’s just how it goes. I’m just trying to do my job, go up there and compete and help us win.”	Tyler O’Neill singled with one out before Edman, hitting for Matt Carpenter, greeted Adam Morgan with a two-run shot to left. It was Edman’s second career pinch-hit homer.	DeJong capped the scoring with a two-run shot off Dan Winkler for a 6-0 lead.	The Cardinals improved to 2-6 against the Cubs this season, their worst start against their division rival since dropping the first 12 in 1978.	Kim (4-5) extended his scoreless streak to 15 innings. He permitted five hits and walked one.	“Slider was really good. He was just in control, good rhythm, good pace,” Cardinals manager Mike Shildt said.	Davies gave up three runs and seven hits in 4 1/3 innings. He held the Cardinals scoreless in 11 2/3 previous innings this season.	Davies has yielded seven runs in 13 1/3 innings since the right-hander and three relievers combined to no-hit the Dodgers on June 24, when the Cubs were tied for first in the NL Central.	The Cardinals jumped in front on Carpenter’s RBI single in the first. Davies walked two in the inning.	Chicago (44-46) will enter the All-Star break below .500 for the first time since it was 43-45 in 2017. The Cubs were a season-high 11-games over .500 on June 13.	“We have to win as a team. But I cannot ask everybody to play like I do or to play like Báez and I play,” Contreras said. “Everybody’s different. I know they might be tired, but I’m here to win.”	THE WEATHER	Light rain fell throughout the game, which wasn’t delayed.	MOLINA SAYS NO	Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina was selected to his 10th All-Star Game to replace the Giants’ Buster Posey, who has a thumb injury. But Molina said he’ll skip due to a foot injury.	“I want to take those four days and rest and try to do it for the team,” he said. “I think that’s a smart decision.”	Brewers catcher Omar Narváez will instead go to the All-Star Game.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Cardinals: RHP Miles Mikolas (right forearm tightness) threw a bullpen and could go on a rehab assignment late this month. ... RHP Jordan Hicks (right elbow inflammation) has resumed playing catch.	Cubs: As a precaution, Báez was removed in the top of the ninth after jamming his thumb, manager David Ross said. …INF/OF Kris Bryant (right hamstring) returned to the lineup after not starting the previous two games. ... INF Matt Duffy (low back strain) and INF David Bote (dislocated left shoulder) are expected to begin rehab assignments the week of July 18.	UP NEXT	RHP Adam Wainwright (7-5, 3.58 ERA) is scheduled to start Sunday’s series finale for St. Louis against RHP Trevor Williams (3-2, 5.51 ERA).	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SEATTLE -- — Chris Flexen pitched three-hit ball for seven innings in another home win, Luis Torrens added an RBI triple and the Seattle Mariners beat the Los Angeles Angels 2-0 on Saturday night.	David Fletcher of the Angels extended his hitting streak to 23 games.	Flexen (8-3), signed out of the Korea Baseball Organization following last season, struck out six. He improved to 6-2 in 10 starts at home as the Mariners won their third straight game.	“He's a great man on the mound,” Torrens said of Flexen. “He's the man of the moment right now.”	Flexen had multiple suitors in the U.S. in the offseason and even considered staying in Korea. Midway through the season, he's now Seattle's top starter.	“I 100% made the right decision,” Flexen said. “I love being here. I love this organization.”	Drew Steckenrider struck out the side in the eighth and Paul Sewald got Shohei Ohtani to strike out swinging on the way to his second save and a combined three-hitter.	Torrens tripled off Patrick Sandoval (2-3) with two outs in the sixth for a 2-0 lead. He was also instrumental in the fourth inning when he moved Mitch Haniger from first to third with a single, setting up Jake Fraley's RBI grounder.	Torrens has eight hits, two home runs, six RBI and his only two career triples during Seattle’s current eight-game homestand. He’s also drawn a walk in six straight games, something no other Mariners player has done since 2015.	Torrens credits his recent surge on “my mentality,” he said. “I'm starting to believe in myself and I've started to give all my effort when I'm playing.”	Sandoval struck out six and gave up six hits over seven innings, but got no run support. In his last two games against the Mariners, he has struck out 16 over 13 innings, but is 0-2.	“I think Sandoval was outstanding,” Angels manager Joe Maddon said. “That may have been his all-time high for pitches and innings thrown. I think it was important to stretch him out mentally more than physically.”	FLETCHER’S STREAK	Fletcher singled in the fourth inning to move into a tie with Garret Anderson and Jim Edmonds for the third-longest Angels hitting streak. He needs hits in two more consecutive games to tie Rod Carew for second.	Fletcher fielded Ty France’s ground ball by second base in the sixth and made the forceout on Mitch Haniger, then got wiped out by shortstop José Iglesias as he made the pivot to first. He was checked by trainers for an apparent leg injury, but stayed in the game.	OHTANI’S SCHEDULE	Angels manager Joe Maddon said he hasn’t set the post-break pitching rotation. He does know now what role dual star Ohtani will play in the All-Star game, “but I’m not permitted to tell you.” Maddon did say he thinks Ohtani’s role in the second half will be very similar to the first half with one caveat: “I also believe we might want to be more vigilant with hitting and pitching on the same day. … The conversations will occur.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Mariners: 3B Kyle Seager (right shin) was a late scratch with a bone bruise he got in a collision on Thursday night against the Yankees. He played Friday, but trainers were unable to reduce the swelling for Saturday's game. He's day-to-day and might not go on the injury list due to the All-Star break. “It was one of the worst ones I've ever seen,” Servais said. “... It's like a bruised banana. It's bad."	RHP Casey Sadler threw live to hitters before Saturday’s game in the next step of his recovery from a shoulder injury. Sadler has been on the injured list since May 2. “From what I understand he felt good coming out of that, so he’ll continue to build upon that as he gets closer to rejoining our bullpen,” manager Scott Servais said. Sadler was 0-1 with a 1.64 ERA in 11 games before landing on the injured list.	UP NEXT	Angels: LHP José Suarez (3-2, 2.37) makes his second start of the season in 11 appearances. He lost on Monday in his first start after giving up two earned runs in three innings.	Mariners: LHP Hector Santiago (1-1, 3.38) will get the start while his 10-game suspension for tampering is under appeal. The bullpen start is necessary due to injury to regular starter Justus Sheffield (left forearm strain).	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

LOS ANGELES -- — Justin Turner and Mookie Betts hit grand slams, Albert Pujols and AJ Pollock each homered twice and the Los Angeles Dodgers matched a franchise record by connecting eight times in all, routing the Arizona Diamondbacks 22-1 on Saturday night.	Cody Bellinger and Zach McKinstry also homered as the Dodgers matched a Los Angeles mark for runs, last scoring 22 in 2001 at Colorado. This was their highest-scoring game ever at Dodger Stadium, which opened in 1962.	“That is a sign of a really good club that regardless of the score, we just keep trying to win pitches and not give at-bats away,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. “When you do that, some good things can happen.”	The Dodgers won for just the second time in their last six games. They scored in just four different innings, but broke loose in a big way — five runs in the first, four more in the second, seven runs in the seventh and six in the eighth.	The 22 runs marked the most allowed in a game by the Diamondbacks.	Los Angeles led 9-0 after two innings and breezed behind the pitching of Walker Buehler, who was chosen as an All-Star Game replacement Saturday.	Buehler (9-1) went six scoreless innings, allowing three hits and striking out seven.	“I know it was nice to have Walker come out and throw the ball well,” Roberts said. “Obviously we took a lot of good at-bats and hit a lot of balls out of the ballpark just up and down the lineup. AJ had a huge night, Justin, everyone.”	The Dodgers started pulling starters out of the game in the fourth inning, starting with shortstop Chris Taylor.	“It was good to get some guys off their feet early and get some other guys at-bats and just get to the next day,” Roberts said.	It was yet another low point in a season full of them for the Diamondbacks. The mood was so bleak during a 17-game losing streak, another 13-game skid and a record 24-game road drought this season that this debacle was not considered rock bottom.	“Nah … that ought to tell you the type of season we’ve had,” manager Torey Lovullo said. “You lose 20-plus (consecutive) games on the road, you’re fighting a 16-, 17-game losing streak, whatever that number was.	“I think for me, we’re on the rise. We’re in a different spot. I think we are well beyond our worst days here," he said.	Turner, added earlier in the day to the All-Star team, hit his first career grand slam in the second inning off starter Caleb Smith (2-6). Smith never recorded an out in the second before departing, giving up nine runs on six hits with three walks while recording just three outs.	Betts hit his fifth slam in the seventh. The Dodgers top the majors with nine grand slams this year.	Pujols connected in the seventh and eighth, giving him 675 career home runs. His last homer came off Arizona outfielder Josh Reddick, who got the last two outs.	“It was great. It’s always fun watching Albert,” Pollock said. “Every time he hits a homer, you’re watching history. The guy has been doing it for so long. He’s hit a lot of homers and every one is special.”	Bellinger and Pollock hit back-to-back home runs in the first. McKinstry and Pujols went back-to-back in the seventh.	The Dodgers sent eight batters to the plate in the first inning against Smith, taking a 2-0 lead on Max Muncy's double that scored Betts and Taylor.	Muncy, Taylor and Betts already had been named National League All-Stars, with Betts bowing out of Tuesday’s game because unspecified injuries.	The Dodgers improved to 8-1 against the Diamondbacks this season.

SAN DIEGO -- — German Marquez pitched seven dominant innings, limiting the Padres to three hits and leading the Colorado Rockies over San Diego 3-0 on Saturday night.	“My fastball was good today. My two-seam was working well today and that was the key,” said Marquez, who added right now he's pitching the best he ever has in his career. “I have spent a lot of time on my delivery.”	Colorado is a major league-worst 8-34 on the road. The Rockies are 2/3 on their current swing, the first time they've won more than one game on a trip this season.	“That was a really good outing against a good team at a packed house at Petco,” Rockies manager Bud Black said. “This was a good one (win). German put the team on his back tonight.”	The Rockies had lost nine in a row at Petco Park before Marquez (8-6) took over.	“German’s breaking ball was pretty consistent all night. But he got outs with every pitch. The fastball had good life and movement,” Black said. “He has a presence and poise with being a pitcher in his fifth year....When it gets hot he is able to handle it.”	Marquez struck out nine and threw an economical 86 pitches, 58 for strikes. The Padres had only one runner reach as far as second base against him -- Eric Hosmer doubled in the second.	“Marquez got in a pretty good grove,” Padres manager Jayce Tingler said. “We weren't able to string enough hits together. ... We couldn't get his pitch count up either, to get him out early.”	Prior to the Padres batting the fourth, it was announced over the public address system that third baseman Manny Machado had been added to the NL All-Star team, eliciting a huge cheer and chants of “Manny” from the crowd and prompting his teammates to mob him in the dugout. Machado replaced the injured Ronald Acuña Jr. of the Atlanta Braves on the NL squad.	“Honestly, it is a great honor," he said. “To be able to go there with the San Diego Padres for the first time with my teammates we have here, it is an exciting moment.”	“Obviously, it is an unfortunate situation with someone going down with a terrible injury,” he said.	With San Diego trailing 3-0 in the eighth, Hosmer doubled to lead off against reliever Carlos Estevez and Victor Caratini singled him to third with one out. But the Padres couldn't do any more damage, and Daniel Bard pitched a scoreless ninth to earn his 13th save.	Padres starter Joe Musgrove (5-7) was cruising until the fifth inning when he loaded the bases with one out and surrendered a two-run single to Charlie Blackmon that skipped under the glove of a diving Hosmer at first base. Hosmer committed a fielding error earlier in the inning leading to an unearned run.	While the Padres' bats were silent, San Diego make some sparkling plays with their gloves.	Left fielder Tommy Pham made a diving catch to take away a hit from Garrett Hampson, second baseman Jake Cronenworth made a nice stop to rob Blackmon and center fielder Trent Grisham charged full speed to make a spectacular diving catch to steal a hit from Colorado’s Dom Nunez.	“I got a lot of help from my teammates early on. They made some really nice plays in the first inning,” Musgrove said. “Hosmer makes that play (Blackmon's hit) nine out of 10 times. I know he is thinking about that.”	Rockies leadoff hitter Raimel Tapia got a hit and walked twice, stole two bases and scored two runs.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Rockies: 1B Matt Adams (elbow) was activated from the from the 10-day injured list. ... LHP Austin Gomber (left forearm tightness), who is on the 10-day IL, threw in a simulated game at Petco Park. He threw around 35 pitches over two innings. He is scheduled to throw a session on July 14 in Denver and could be headed toward a rehab assignment as early as July 16.	Padres: LHP Matt Strahm (right patellar tendon surgery) pitched a simulated inning at Petco Park. He rejoined the team in June and has been throwing regular bullpen sessions. The next step would be a rehab assignment, an Tingler said a late-July return is “very realistic.” Strahm hasn’t pitched at all this season. … C Austin Nola (left knee sprain), who landed on the IL in late May, was sent on a rehab assignment with Triple-A El Paso beginning on Friday.	UP NEXT	Rockies: RHP Jon Gray (5-6, 3.94) starts the final game of the series.	Padres: LHP Ryan Weathers (4-2, 3.02) pitches Sunday.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

BALTIMORE -- — Adam Engel hit a three-run homer in the 10th inning and the Chicago White Sox rolled into the All-Star break Sunday with a 7-5 victory over Baltimore to complete a season sweep of the Orioles.	Andrew Vaughn homered twice for the White Sox, who have won five in a row and 10 of 13 overall. Chicago leads the AL Central by eight games over Cleveland.	“I think we’ve won games in a bunch of different ways this year with a bunch of different guys,” Engel said. “Guys are figuring out what it takes to win. Being the better team isn’t going to guarantee any wins and being the lesser team doesn’t mean you’re going to lose.”	The White Sox went 7-0 against Baltimore this season. It is the first time in franchise history Chicago has swept a season series of at least seven games against any team, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.	Pinch-hitter Trey Mancini’s two-out, two-run homer in the Orioles ninth made it 4-all. He’ll take part in the All-Star Home Run Derby on Monday night at Coors Field in Denver.	Baltimore has lost four in a row and is 1-7 in July. The Orioles have dropped eight consecutive games to the White Sox dating back to 2019, their longest skid in the series since another eight-game slide in 1989-90.	“It’s just a tough loss because you like to see guys battle back and win those type of games,” Baltimore manager Brandon Hyde said.	Chicago swept a series at Camden Yards for the first time since 2005.	Yoán Moncada led off the Chicago 10th with a walk to join automatic runner Tim Anderson on base. Tyler Wells (2-1) retired the next two batters, but Engel went deep to left-center to make it 7-4.	“I kind of called it --- I’m not going to lie,” Vaughn said. “If you ask (bench coach) Miguel Cairo, I said, ‘Here comes a three-run homer,’ and it happened. It was pretty cool. I just felt it. I don’t know why. I felt it the bones. He’s been super clutch for us this year and that was a big swing.”	Matt Foster recorded two outs for his first career save.	Chicago was poised to close it out in the ninth after closer Liam Hendriks (4-2) struck out his first two hitters before Ramón Urías’ single. Mancini, perhaps warming up for his Derby appearance, connected for his second career pinch-hit homer and first since 2017.	Vaughn put the White Sox ahead 4-2 in the sixth. After reliever Paul Fry hit Engel and walked Leury García, Vaughn greeted Cole Sulser with a three-run drive.	Austin Hays’ two-run homer in the first was Baltimore’s only damage against Chicago starter Dylan Cease, who struck out six in five innings.	Baltimore starter Spenser Watkins allowed one run --- Vaughn’s homer in the fourth --- in 4 1/3 innings. He struck out four before being lifted after completing two turns through the White Sox order.	Anderson extended his hitting streak to 12 with a fifth-inning single.	TRAINER’S ROOM	White Sox: OF Eloy Jiménez (torn left pectoral tendon) went 1 for 3 with a walk and a run and played seven innings in left field Sunday for Class A Winston-Salem in the second game of his rehabilitation assignment. He served as the DH in the first game of a doubleheader Saturday.	Orioles: 1B Ryan Mountcastle left the game with a bruised left forearm after being hit by a pitch from Cease in the first. X-rays were negative. Hyde said he is optimistic Mountcastle will be ready after the All-Star break. … SS Freddy Galvis (right quadriceps strain) and RHP Hunter Harvey (right lat strain) could both return by the end of July. Galvis will begin rehab work in Florida this week.	O’S PITCHING WOES	Orioles starting pitchers have logged at least six innings in just seven of 58 games since lefty John Means’ no-hitter on May 5. Means, who has been on the injured list since June 6, has three of those outings. Baltimore starters have gone 16 games in a row without a six-inning stint, and made it through five just twice in that span.	The Orioles are 13-45 since Means’ no-hitter.	“We threw the ball well the first month and kind of hung around .500ish, and since the Means no-hitter we haven’t been able to stay in games on the mound,” Hyde said. “Our rotation is beat up. We don’t have good numbers. Our bullpen is taxed because of it, so a lot of concern there. We somehow have to get our starting pitchers to go a little bit longer.”	UP NEXT	White Sox: Chicago returns home after the All-Star break on Friday for a three-game series against the Astros. The White Sox suffered a four-game sweep at Houston last month.	Orioles: Baltimore begins a six-game road trip Friday at Kansas City. The Orioles have not faced the Royals since 2019.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

MIAMI -- — Marlins right-hander Pablo López set a major league record by striking out the first nine batters to start a game, pitching Miami past the Atlanta Braves 7-4 Sunday.	A day after the Braves lost star outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. to a season-ending knee injury, their hitters had no answers for López’s early dominance.	López set the mark on the one-year anniversary of his father’s death.	“There were a lot of emotions and mixed feelings out there today. My dad meant so much to me in my progression,” López said. “Being able to perform and get (that accomplishment) was really cool and really special.”	López struck out Ehire Adrianza, Freddie Freeman and Ozzie Albies each swinging in the first inning. He then fanned Austin Riley, Orlando Arcia and Dansby Swanson also all swinging in the second inning.	In the third, Guillermo Heredia looked at strike three, Kevan Smith went down swinging and Ian Anderson was called out on strikes.	The 25-year-old López broke the mark of eight straight strikeouts to begin a game set by Jim Deshaies in 1986 and matched by Jacob deGrom in 2014 and German Marquez in 2018.	”(Pablo) was on a little bit of a mission today,” said Miami manager Don Mattingly, who admitted not knowing that his starting pitcher was making history. “All I knew is that he punched out nine guys and really stuck with me at the time.”	Mattingly knew López was having a special day the first time he glanced over at the left-field scoreboard, where the pitch count was posted.	“I look up there and he has 11 strikes in 11 pitches,” he said. “That’s when you kind of know something big is starting to happen.”	López (5-5) threw 30 of his first 35 pitches for strikes. The Venezuelan began the day with 102 strikeouts over 95 innings in 18 starts this season.	“I wanted to execute and not leave anything out over the plate to those guys,” he said “I just wanted to get ahead in the count and use my purpose pitches to set up other pitches.”	Adrianza became the first Atlanta hitter to put a ball in play when he grounded out on an 0-1 pitch to begin the fourth. Freeman doubled for the Braves' first hit, setting up RBI singles by Albies and Arcia.	López gave up three runs in six innings — after his sensational start, he didn't strike out anyone in his final three innings.	López gave up five hits and walked two, with 65 of his 83 pitches for strikes.	Jesus Aguilar hit a three-run homer in the first inning off Anderson (5-5) as the Marlins ended a three-game losing streak. Jesus Sanchez tripled, doubled and singled and Miguel Rojas had three hits for Miami.	Sanchez, who enjoyed his first career three-hit game, could only marvel at López’s historic performance with the rest of the fielders.	“Playing in left, I’m kind of looking over at the other outfielders and shaking my head like what is going on in there with Pablo,” Sanchez said. “It was a lot of fun, for sure.”	Dansby Swanson hit his 14th and 15th home runs for Atlanta.	“We had a little run there (after the first three innings) and I thought we might get back in it, but it didn’t happen,” Atlanta manager Brian Snitker said.	Anderson lasted only 2 1/3 innings, giving up four runs on six hits and five walks.	UPPER DECK DOGS	Along with the 9,456 fans in attendance, there were 388 pooches on hand as part of the Miami Marlins’ first “Bark At The Park” promotion since 2019.	ROSTER MOVE	Braves: Recalled INF/OF Johan Camargo from the Triple-A Gwinnett and placed Acuña on the 60-day injured list with a torn ACL in his right knee.	UP NEXT	Braves: Return to action after the All-Star break by hosting Tampa Bay on Friday night.	Marlins: At Philadelphia on Friday night to start the second half.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BOSTON -- — Ronald Torreyes hit a three-run homer, Philadelphia used six pitchers after losing its scheduled starter to COVID-19 contact tracing, and the Phillies hung on to beat the Boston Red Sox 5-4 on Sunday.	The Phillies took the last two of the three-game series at Boston and enter the All-Star break at 44-44 — Philadelphia’s first time at .500 since being 34-34 in late June.	“This is a resilient group. We’ve probably had as many tough losses as any team in baseball and we have found a way,” manager Joe Girardi said. “Two weeks ago we were kind of in a nightmarish week. The last 10 days, we’ve played extremely well. We've beat some good teams, taken some series from good teams. We've had a winning road trip — extremely proud.”	Torreyes had three of Philadelphia’s six hits and J.T. Realmuto had an RBI single in the third.	Philadelphia had to scratch starter Aaron Nola and place the right-hander and three teammates on COVID-19-related injured reserve on Sunday. Brandon Kintzler started the group effort with one-plus inning, Cristopher Sánchez (1-0) got the win after taking over in the second, and Ranger Suárez finished it, striking out two in the ninth to earn his second save after 2 1/3 scoreless innings.	“We felt like if we could get Kintzler and Sánchez through at least three we’d be OK,” Girardi said. “I give Sánchez a ton of credit because he threw a light side yesterday. I don’t think he was supposed to pitch until Monday. To get as many outs as he did was huge for us.”	The Red Sox lost their second straight at Fenway Park, where they had a nine-game winning streak before Philadelphia’s 11-2 rout on Saturday night.	Boston enters the All-Star break leading the AL East at 55-36.	“We’re in first place in the East. Nobody can take that away from us,” Boston manager Alex Cora said. “I’m a little disappointed that we lost the last two series, but good teams get disappointed when that happens. We expect better than this.”	Xander Bogaerts homered for Boston, which outhit Philadelphia 11-6 but could not overcome a 5-1 deficit after Torreyes’ homer in the fourth. Boston was 1-for-9 with runners in scoring position and left 10 runners on base.	“It was the bullpen overall. They all did a great job. Each guy that came into the game, kept the game close,” Torreyes said through a translator.	Philadelphia scored five runs, four earned, off Nick Pivetta (7-4), who worked four innings against the team that traded him to Boston last summer.	“I have a lot of respect for those guys over there. It’s exciting to compete against them. I came up with quite a few of those guys. I think that’s the biggest thing,” Pivetta said.	Rhys Hoskins had a two-out double in the fourth and Brad Miller walked to set up Torreyes, who belted Pivetta's 3-2 fastball into the top row of seats above the Green Monster.	“It felt very good. It’s always good to put the team ahead,” Torreyes said.	Torreyes also singled in the third and scored on Realmuto’s two-out single, which led to another run on a throwing error by right fielder Hunter Renfroe.	Pivetta pitched four innings, allowing five runs — four earned — on four hits. He walked two and struck out four.	The Red Sox scored twice in the sixth on Bobby Dalbec's RBI single and Christian Arroyo's run-scoring double, but were blanked after that.	SHORT START	Forced into the role of an opener, Kintzler threw one pitch in the second, and Bogaerts drove it out of Fenway for his 15th homer. The Phillies went to the bullpen for Sánchez, who lasted until Arroyo led off the fifth with a double off the wall in right-center.	“It’s wasn’t like it was sprung on us at 9 o’clock this morning. We pretty much knew yesterday after the game that this was the likely scenario, so you’ve got to deal with it,” Girardi said.	SOLID IN CENTER	Kiké Hernández made a diving grab on a fly ball that was sinking quickly in center field in the fifth. Segura gambled that the ball would drop and ran from first all the way to third before Hernández got up and threw to first to complete the double play.	Hernández made another diving catch in the sixth on a sinking liner by Andrew McCutchen.	EARLY BREAK	Brad Miller was ejected in the ninth after arguing a called third strike from Brandon Workman. Torreyes restrained Miller until Girardi took over as Miller shouted and pointed at umpire Jansen Visconti.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Phillies: Nola was placed on the COVID-19 list because of contact tracing after 3B Alec Bohm tested positive. RHP Connor Brogdon and LHP Bailey Falter were placed on the list because of contact tracing.	Red Sox: 1B Marwin González left the game after two innings because of tightness in his right hamstring. Dalbec replaced him.	UP NEXT	Phillies: Host the Miami Marlins for a doubleheader on Friday to open a four-game series including the makeup of a game rained out on July 1.	Red Sox: Return from the All-Star break Thursday and open a four-game series at the New York Yankees.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- — Robbie Ray took a no-hitter into the seventh inning and the Toronto Blue Jays beat Tampa Bay 3-1 Sunday, ending the Rays' six-game winning streak.	The left-hander’s bid ended with one out when Yandy Díaz was awarded a double after a fan reached over the left-field fence and tried to catch his drive. If the ball had not been interfered with, it would have struck the wall and not been catchable by left fielder Lourdes Gurriel Jr.	“I felt good on the mound, I felt really good with my pitches,” Ray said. “About maybe the fifth inning where I was like, ‘OK it’s a possibility.’ Just felt like my fastball was really good today. I felt like I was able to pretty much put where I wanted to.”	Díaz's hit underwent a video review to confirm it was a double and not a homer.	“It was a double, and thankfully a hit at that time,” Rays manager Kevin Cash said.	Ray (7-4) allowed one hit and one walk, while striking out 11 in seven innings. It was his ninth game this season of nine or more strikeouts, tying New York Mets ace Jacob deGrom for most in the majors."	Ray threw 71 of 103 pitches for strikes, mixing in mid-90 mph fastballs and an upper 80's slider.	“Oh man, Robbie Ray was bringing it today,” said Blue Jays catcher Danny Jansen, who hit a solo homer.	“It was awesome,” Toronto manager Charlie Montoyo added. “It was fun to watch.”	Ray enters the All-Star break with 130 strikeouts. Only Roger Clemens, with 140 in 1997, had more in Blue Jays history at the break.	Tim Mayza worked a perfect eighth. Jordan Romano gave up Brandon Lowe's solo homer and a single to Díaz before getting his seventh save in the final game for both teams before the All-Star break.	The AL champion Rays are second in the AL East, 1 1/2 games in back of Boston. Toronto is eight games behind the Red Sox.	Lowe has seven homers in his last nine games, and a career-high 21 overall.	Jansen put the Blue Jays up 1-0 during the third with his fourth homer.	Santiago Espinal had an RBI single and Cavan Biggio hit a sacrifice fly as the Blue Jays took a 3-0 lead in the fourth.	Rich Hill (6-4) gave up three runs and four hits in five innings.	Toronto shortstop Bo Bichette had an infield single in four at-bats in his 162nd MLB game. Through that many games, Bichette leads the franchise in hits (203), runs (121), RBI (101) and extra-base hits (79).	ENCOURAGING NEWS	Rays minor leaguer Tyler Zombro, struck in the head by a line drive June 3 while pitching for Triple-A Durham, said on his Twitter account this weekend that he continues making progress in his recovery.	“To everyone who continues to reach out about my progress, thank you! Over the last couple of weeks my cognitive function has improved greatly, and I have tested out of both speech and occupational therapy. I continue PT sessions with concussion specialists at Duke.”	PITCHING ENFORCEMENTS	The Rays entered Sunday with an AL-best ERA of 3.51 and will be adding depth over the next month.	RHP Chris Archer (right forearm tightness) will pitch for the minor league FCL Rays Monday, with RHP Oliver Drake (right flexor tendon strain) following him on Tuesday.	RHP Ryan Thompson (right shoulder inflammation) is nearing a rehab assignment, and RHP Nick Anderson (right elbow strain) is throwing off a mound.	STEALTH SNAG	The Blue Jays’ first ended on a double-play that started when first baseman Ji-Man Choi made a nifty grab on a low and hard liner off the bat of Vladimir Guerrero Jr. The slugger stood silently near the plate for a few seconds afterwards glancing down the first-base line with a look of disbelief.

MILWAUKEE -- — Nick Castellanos hit a tiebreaking two-run single off All-Star closer Josh Hader with two outs in the ninth inning, and the Cincinnati Reds beat the Milwaukee Brewers 3-1 on Sunday.	The Reds took three of four in the series to pull within four games of the NL Central-leading Brewers. The teams begin a three-game set in Cincinnati on Friday night.	The Brewers (53-39) and Reds (48-42) are the only teams in the division with winning records at the All-Star break.	Ryan Hendrix (5-1), the fourth of five Reds relievers, got two outs for the win. Josh Osich worked a perfect ninth for his first career save in his 246th appearance.	“We're so excited that we finished like this,” Reds starting pitcher Luis Castillo said.	Reds manager David Bell applauded the effort of his team during the four-game series.	“It’s been a pleasure just to be around these guys, watching them go about their business," Bell said.	It's especially rewarding, Bell said, winning the final three games of the series after dropping the opener.	“That says a lot,” Bell said.	He added that the team is looking forward to returning home after the break for a rematch against the Brewers.	“We sense a real positive energy there. It’s been important for us all year," Bell said. “Our players love playing in Cincinnati.”	Hader (3-2) came in to pitch the ninth after he surrendered a game-winning homer to Eugenio Suárez on Saturday night. He hit Suárez on Sunday, and Kyle Farmer followed with a pinch-hit single.	After a strikeout, Hader walked Jonathan India to load the bases before Castellanos laced a hit up the middle.	Brewers manager Craig Counsell said he isn't concerned about Hader, who has pitched four of the last five days and surrendered runs for the third time in his last four outings.	“It just hasn’t gone his way the last few outings. He was perfect up until then essentially," Counsell said. "The other team is trying to get him. There’s nothing to note. They just got him, unfortunately.”	Milwaukee starter and fellow All-Star Brandon Woodruff also offered support for his teammate.	“When you are so good, people expect you do to do crazy things every time you go out and pitch," Woodruff said. “He’s unbelievable. He’s the best closer in the game."	The Reds jumped in front in the first against right-hander Woodruff. Joey Votto singled in Jesse Winker, but Tyler Stephenson grounded into an inning-ending double play.	The Brewers loaded the bases against Castillo in the fourth, but Castillo struck out Woodruff to end the threat.	Milwaukee threatened again in the fifth, putting two runners on with one out. But Castillo snagged Omar Narváez’s liner and doubled Willy Adames off first.	“My heart stopped for a second,” Castillo said.	Castillo departed after issuing a one-out walk to Jace Peterson in the sixth. Amir Garrett then struck out pinch-hitter Keston Hiura, but Peterson stole second and scored on Jackie Bradley Jr.'s single to right.	Castillo allowed three hits, but he issued a career-high six walks.	Woodruff gave up a season-high nine hits in six innings. He struck out four and walked none.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Reds: Reliever Art Warren was removed with one out in the seventh while pitching to Christian Yelich. Warren sailed a pitch to the backstop during Yelich’s at-bat and left after a quick visit by a team trainer. ... Farmer didn’t start for a second consecutive game as he deals with body soreness. Bell said he hopes that the rest, combined with four days off for the All-Star break, will provide adequate time for Farmer to heal. Farmer had a pinch-hit single in the ninth and remained in the game at shortstop.	Brewers: 2B Kolten Wong, who is on the 10-day IL with left calf soreness, ran the bases prior to the game.	BREAK TIME	The Brewers are in first place at the All-Star break for just the sixth time in the 51-year history of the franchise. The Brewers, who moved to Milwaukee for the 1970 season after playing one season as the Seattle Pilots, previously held down the top spot in their division in 1982, 2007, 2011, 2014 and 2017.	PLAY BALL	The Reds head into the All-Star break having played 33 games in 34 days, including games on 18 consecutive days to end the stretch.	OUT BY A FOOT	After reaching on a bloop single with two outs in the seventh, Willy Adames easily beat a throw to second on an attempted steal. After a review, Adames was ruled out as it appeared as though he slid into the foot of Reds second baseman Jonathan India and not the base.	FAMILIAR FACES	The Reds and Brewers are in the midst of facing off in seven consecutive games. The Reds haven’t faced the same opponent seven times in a row since 1953 when they went 4-3 against the Milwaukee Braves.	UP NEXT	The Brewers and Reds will square off again after the All-Star break in a three-game series beginning Friday in Cincinnati.	----	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

MINNEAPOLIS -- — Jorge Polanco hit a game-ending three-run homer in the 10th inning, and the Minnesota Twins completed a four-game sweep of the Detroit Tigers with a wild 12-9 victory on Sunday.	Polanco hit a full-count pitch from Derek Holland (1-2) to left field for his 12th homer of the season.	Catcher Jake Rogers had given the Tigers a 9-8 lead with a grand slam in the top of the ninth, but Twins catcher Ben Rortvedt tied it with a solo shot in the bottom half.	Tyler Duffey (1-2) pitched a scoreless 10th. Holland intentionally walked Nelson Cruz and retired Alex Kiriloff on a pop fly before Polanco ended it.	"There was a lot going on today, and it ended in a big moment for (Polanco) and the rest of our team," Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said.	Rogers seemingly had given the Tigers an unlikely win with his blast off Twins reliever Taylor Rogers, who allowed two hits and a walk to load the bases. Jake Rogers hit the first pitch an estimated 421 feet to straightaway center for his first career grand slam.	But Rortvedt took Holland deep, his second career homer, with one out in the ninth.	Polanco had three hits and five RBI, while Alex Kiriloff and Max Kepler each had two hits and drove in two runs as the Twins came from behind to win for the third time in the series.	“That was a real character game," Baldelli said. “You learn little bit about yourself, you deal with a lot. There were a ton of different things that came up in that game, a lot of them made life difficult for our guys, and we fought through it.”	Akil Baddoo homered and drove in three runs for the Tigers, who had won four of their previous five series and were 10-5 in their last 15 games before coming up empty in Minneapolis.	Trailing 4-0, the Twins began their first comeback with Kepler’s 10th homer of the season in the fifth and Polanco's RBI single in the sixth.	In the seventh, the Twins scored four runs against three relievers to take a 6-4 lead. Gregory Soto, the Tigers’ lone All-Star representative, gave up Kiriloff’s RBI single to tie the game with two outs. Polanco and Kepler each followed with run-scoring base hits.	“We thought the seventh inning was the critical inning, and that was just the beginning," Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said. “The back end of that game again was disappointing, but we fought back and gave ourselves every chance to win it. We just couldn’t get the last out.”	Baddoo led off the eighth with a home run off reliever Jorge Alcala, but Josh Donaldson’s RBI double and another run-scoring single by Kiriloff put the Twins back up 8-5.	Twins starter José Berríos lasted seven innings, allowing four earned runs on three hits with four walks and eight strikeouts on a season-high 108 pitches.	The Tigers didn’t have a hit until there were two out in the fifth, but by the end of the inning they led 4-0.	Harold Castro’s two-out single broke up Berríos' no-hit bid. Zack Short and Jake Rogers drew walks to load the bases before Baddoo dumped an 0-2 pitch into left field for a two-run single.	Baddoo advanced to second on the throw home and, one pitch later, he and Rogers scored on Jonathan Schoop’s soft single into right field.	Tigers starter Wily Peralta allowed one run over five innings but was pulled after throwing 97 pitches. Six Detroit relievers combined to allow seven runs over the next three frames.	COMEBACK KIDS	The Twins completed their sweep of the Tigers by defeating them in much the same way as they had in the previous three games — by wearing out their bullpen.	On Thursday, Minnesota trailed 2-0 in the fifth and won 5-3.	On Friday, the game was scoreless in the sixth and the Twins won 4-2.	On Saturday, the Twins trailed 4-0 in the sixth and won 9-4.	Including Sunday's rally, the Twins scored 29 runs after the fifth inning.	“Our lineup has really lengthened out and guys have been having good at-bats one through nine,” Baldelli said. “Guys are just coming up big, and it’s not the same guys every single night. We have some guys having good years but it’s not the same guys right now. And when you have nine spots in the order contributing like this ... it really keeps you going because you know the next guy might do something.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Tigers: OF Nomar Mazara, who was scratched from Saturday’s lineup due to illness, was feeling better and available off the bench. ... IF Niko Goodrum was scratched on Sunday due to a sore left calf.	Twins: C Ryan Jeffers left in the fifth inning after fouling a ball off his left knee.	UP NEXT	After the All-Star break, the Twins and Tigers will meet for another four-game set, this time at Detroit. The series begins with a doubleheader on Friday. The Tigers are scheduled to start RHP José Ureña (2-8, 6.43 ERA) in Game 1 and are planning a bullpen game for the nightcap. The Twins have yet to name a starter for Game 1.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

HOUSTON -- — Thousands of fans left Minute Maid Park with replica No. 27 Jose Altuve jerseys from a giveaway on Sunday.	The Houston Astros star didn't make it off the field with his.	Altuve hit a three-run homer to cap a startling six-run rally in the bottom of the ninth inning, getting his shirt yanked off in a frenzied celebration and lifting the Astros over the New York Yankees 8-7.	“It was a miracle," manager Dusty Baker said.	The Astros had been shut out by the Yankees the previous two games, highlighted by ace Gerrit Cole’s three-hitter in a 4-0 win on Saturday night.	But in a series where the teams took turns trolling each other after lingering ill will over the years — including Yankees star Aaron Judge seeming to mock Altuve — the Astros and their dynamic second baseman had the final say.	“It was pretty amazing how Altuve did it again," catcher Martin Maldonado said. “He’s a guy with a big heart and is the face of this team. He got to the plate we knew something big was going to happen."	Big league teams are 493-2 this season with a lead of at least four runs going to the ninth — the Yankees wasted an 8-4 advatage in an 11-8 defeat to the Los Angeles Angels on June 30, making this the first season the Yankees twice lost games when leading by four runs entering the ninth.	New York led 7-2 after a three-run homer by Gary Sanchez in the eighth inning and was poised for a sweep before the Astros broke loose and dealt the Yankees another aching last-inning loss.	“It’s the ultimate gut punch," manager Aaron Boone said. “You’ve got a five-run lead in the ninth against a great team with a chance to earn the sweep and they come back to win. We’ve got some things to get better at and make sure all hands are where they need to be."	It was the first time the Astros won after trailing by five or more runs in the ninth inning since also being down 7-2 before rallying to beat the Montreal Expos 9-8 on July 25, 1980, according to information provided by the Astros from the Elias Sports Bureau.	After the first two Astros reached base against Domingo Germán in the ninth, Chas McCormick hit a two-run double off Chad Green (3-5). Abraham Toro followed with an RBI double to make it 7-5, still with no outs.	Pinch-hitter Jason Castro singled and one out later, Altuve launched his soaring shot to left field. His teammates greeted him at the plate and ripped off his jersey in the celebration, leaving him shirtless as he hugged Baker on his way off the field.	“It was 100% coming off after that home run," McCormick said of Altuve's jersey.	Added Baker: “That was the most wonderful thing I’ve seen in years."	Altuve was not available for a postgame interview. The Astros said his father was in the hospital and he rushed to be with him.	Boone was asked why he didn't go to slumping closer Aroldis Chapman in the ninth.	“I’m trying to get him into (positive) situations," he said. “It’s critical we get him back to where we need to be. I want him to pitch those situations where he gets through with a clean outing under his belt."	Ralph Garza Jr. (1-2) pitched 1 2/3 scoreless innings for the win. He allowed three walks on a day the Astros won despite walking a whopping 14 batters.	Maldonado homered in the Houston third off Jameson Taillon, making it 1-all and giving Houston its first run in the series.	Maldonado pulled his jersey down on the left side, revealing his bare chest as he rounded third base.	“It was a little hot," he said with a smile. “Trying to get some air inside my shirt."	The move came a day after Judge pulled his jersey together with both hands as he rounded third on a home run. It was a gesture that some interpreted as a reference to Altuve gripping his jersey to keep celebrating teammates from ripping it off after his winning homer in Game 6 of the 2019 AL Championship Series against the Yankees.	After Houston’s sign-stealing scandal was uncovered, some speculated that Altuve didn’t want his jersey pulled off because he was concealing a buzzer that helped in the plot. The allegation was never proven, and Altuve said he did it because he was shy and that he got in trouble with his wife when his jersey was ripped off before.	Altuve was not made available early to discuss Judge's display, but Baker weighed in on it Sunday.	“I noticed what he did,” Baker said. “That was wrong.”	Sanchez also pulled at his jersey very much like Judge did as he trotted home on his homer. He was greeted at the dugout steps by Rougned Odor, who draped him in a heavy Yankees coat — perhaps a reference to Judge saying he did what he did because it gets “pretty chilly" at Minute Maid Park when the roof is closed.	Boone was in no mood to talk about all the back and forth between the players after the loss.	“I really don’t have any interest," he said. “We coughed up a 7-2 lead. I don’t think it had anything to do with the extra stuff people are talking about."	TRAINER’S ROOM	Yankees: Boone said RHP Luis Severino was feeling good after throwing a second bullpen on Saturday and that he would likely face live batters soon. Severino hasn’t played in the majors since 2019 after having Tommy John surgery and his return was slowed because of a groin injury he sustained last month.	Astros: Baker said SS Carlos Correa, who is on the injured list due to health and safety protocols, was still sick on Sunday but didn’t have any other details.	CHANGE OF PLANS	Cole planned to pitch in Tuesday’s All-Star game but won’t be able to after throwing a career-high 129 pitches Saturday night. Boone called Rays manager Kevin Cash, who will manage the AL All-Star team, Sunday morning to let him know Cole wouldn’t be available.	UP NEXT	Yankees: Play the opener of a three-game series against the Boston Red Sox on Thursday night.	Astros: Visit the Chicago White Sox for a three-game series starting Friday night.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- — Matt Olson prepped for the Home Run Derby by hitting two of Oakland’s four homers, Chris Bassitt allowed one run in seven innings, and the Athletics beat the Texas Rangers 4-1 on Sunday.	Olson homered leading off the fourth inning and with one out of the sixth, giving him 23 longballs this season. Jed Lowrie and Sean Murphy hit back-to-back homers in the second inning for the A’s, who won consecutive games for the first time since mid-June and took two of three at Texas.	Olson, a first-time All-Star who will participate in Monday night's derby at Coors Field, came into Sunday with one homer in his last 18 games.	“There’s going to be ups and downs throughout the season,” Olson said. “In the past we’ve been a home run-hitting team. It was good to get back and see some leave the yard.”	Said Texas manager Chris Woodward: “There’s a saying solo homers don’t beat you, but you give up four, they do.”	Bassitt (10-2) gave up four hits, struck out three and walked one to win his career-best 10th straight decision and tie for the AL lead. The All-Star has won his past four starts against the Rangers, including three in the past 18 days. He was coming off a six-run outing at Houston.	“It was more getting back to myself,” Bassitt said. “Didn’t feel too good in Houston.”	Lou Trivino stranded two runners in the ninth inning for his 14th save in 16 opportunities.	Oakland hit eight homers in two days, with back-to-back homers in the second inning of both games. Lowrie’s drive to straightaway center was nearly caught at the wall by a leaping Eli White, and Murphy followed by blasting an 0-2 pitch to left-center.	The Rangers’ Nick Solak, in a 10-for-55 slump and batting ninth for only the second time this season, hit a one-hop double off the wall in right-center with two out to score David Dahl.	Kolby Allard (2-6) allowed all four homers, striking out three and walking none. He has lost to Oakland three times in 18 days, twice to Bassitt, and has dropped his last five starts against the A’s.	CLOSE PLAYS	The top of the eighth inning was busy for first base umpire Bruce Dreckman.	Frank Schwindel reached when Dreckman ruled Texas first baseman Nathaniel Lowe’s foot barely came off the bag, and the call stood following a challenge.	Woodward went out to speak with Dreckman after his challenge failed.	“If there isn’t clear view down the line, maybe we need to install a camera for that,” Woodward said. “It was more like a millimeter off the base. ... That’s not what instant replay’s designed for.”	On Ramón Laureano’s subsequent grounder to second, Dreckman called a double play, but Oakland successfully challenged the out at first. Laureano then got caught in rundown between first and second and made it back to first, but was ruled out by Dreckman for leaving the baseline.	SHORT HOPS	It was the Athletics’ first series win since sweeping the Los Angeles Angels from June 14-16. ... Rangers RF Joey Gallo, with 11 home runs in his last 12 games and 24 this season, was given the day off. Gallo will also participate in the Home Run Derby. ... Dahl matched a season high with three hits, doing it twice in the past week.	TRAINER’S ROOM	A’s: Manager Bob Melvin said he’s unsure whether OF Mark Canha (strained left hip) or DH Mitch Moreland (undisclosed) will be ready when the team resumes play after the All-Star break on Friday. Canha played most recently on June 24, Moreland on July 3.	Rangers: C Sam Huff (knee surgery) will begin a rehab assignment with Double-A Frisco on Tuesday.	UP NEXT	The A’s will begin a six-game homestand on Friday with the first of three against the Indians.	Rangers RHP Jordan Lyles (5-5, 4.86) will start on Friday against Toronto at Buffalo, New York, as Texas begins a season-long 10-game road trip. Lyles has won his last three starts after winning two of his first 14 this season.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

SAN FRANCISCO -- — Kevin Gausman worked six-plus innings of one-run ball and Curt Casali hit a three-run homer as the San Francisco Giants beat the Washington Nationals 3-1 on Sunday to complete a three-game sweep.	San Francisco heads into the All-Star break with the best record in the majors at 57-32, a huge surprise for a team that wasn’t expected to contend in the NL West.	Gausman (9-3), a nine-year veteran headed to his first All-Star Game, struck out nine and held Washington to four hits as he lowered his ERA to 1.73, second in the majors to the Mets’ Jacob deGrom (1.08).	“It’s pretty impressive,” Casali said. “I don’t know what his ERA ended up, it’s sub-2. That’s kind of incredible. To kind of back up what he started last year is even more impressive. I’m just really proud of him and happy.”	Casali, filling in for injured All-Star catcher Buster Posey, hit an 0-1 sinker from Erick Fedde (4-6) to left-center in the second to put the Giants ahead 3-0.	In nine career games against Washington, Casali is 12 for 23 (.522) with four homers.	“I think it’s worth noting that on this homestand we won games and did it without our No. 1 All-Star catcher,” Giants manager Gabe Kapler said. “We had four different catchers start games on this homestand. I think that’s just a good example of how we’ve stepped up for each other as a team.”	Gausman held Washington to three infield singles through the first six innings. But he left a dicey situation for his bullpen in the seventh as the Nationals loaded the bases with no outs.	Dominic Leone limited the damage to one run, striking out Victor Robles with runners at first and third to end the inning.	Starlin Castro doubled with two outs in the top of the ninth, but Giants closer Jake McGee retired Josh Harrison on a lineout to second baseman Donovan Solano to earn his 19th save.	Washington wobbles into the break having lost nine of its past 11 and trails the first-place Mets by six games in the NL East.	“We’ve still got a lot of season left, and I’m excited about that,” Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. “We’ll get some of our guys back, hopefully. We get that four days off, come back re-energized and try to creep back into this thing.”	ROSTER MOVES	Washington placed reliever Kyle McGowin on the 10-day injured list with right biceps fatigue after he left Saturday’s game early. Right-hander Andres Machado was recalled from Triple-A Rochester to take his spot.	The Giants optioned right-hander Tyler Beede to Triple-A Sacramento, a day after he gave up three runs in one inning of relief. He’ll return to starting duties in the minors, Kapler said. Lefty reliever Caleb Baragar was recalled.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Giants: Tommy La Stella (fractured thumb) played five innings at second base and went 0 for 2 Saturday in his first rehab appearance for Sacramento.	UP NEXT	After the All-Star break, the Nationals will host San Diego for a three-game series that starts Friday. The Giants open up the second half with a three-game series at St. Louis. Neither team has announced its starting pitcher.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SEATTLE -- — David Fletcher had four hits and four RBI to extend his hitting streak to 24 games, and the Los Angeles Angels beat the Seattle Mariners 7-1 on Sunday.	Fletcher homered in the third inning, drove in two runs with a single in the fifth and added another RBI in the seventh to snap the Angels’ two-game losing streak. The second baseman, who was left off the AL roster for Tuesday's All-Star Game, finished 4 for 5 after adding an infield single to start a three-run ninth.	“I don’t wish anyone ill, but I’d love to see him sneak into that game on Tuesday,” Angels manager Joe Maddon said.	Shohei Ohtani went 2 for 4 with a double and a walk ahead of his big two days at Coors Field in Denver, where the Angels' two-way superstar will participate in the Home Run Derby and play in the All-Star Game as both a hitter and pitcher.	José Suarez (4-2) allowed three hits over five innings to end Seattle’s three-game winning streak in an outing Maddon called “not great, but good.” It was his first win as a starter this season after being moved into the rotation on July 5. He struck out four and allowed an unearned run on Ty France’s first-inning sacrifice fly, which was set up by Kurt Suzuki's passed ball.	Three Angels relievers worked four innings to complete the four-hitter, with Raisel Iglesias picking up his 19th save to help LA avoid the series sweep.	“We didn't want to get swept,” Maddon said. “That hurts, especially with a team you're trying to catch.”	Yohan Ramirez (0-1), one of seven Seattle pitchers in a bullpen game, took the loss after hitting Taylor Ward to start the fifth inning, then walking Juan Lagares to set up Fletcher’s two-run single. It was a rare difficult outing this season for the bullpen, which had given up an earned run in just one of its last eight games.	“I don’t want it to overshadow a lot of really positive things that we have done here over the first few months of the season," Mariners manager Scott Servais said. "And we’ve put ourselves in a position to play some really meaningful games when we get back from the break and leading into the trade deadline, and we'll see what August and September have in store for us.”	Fletcher’s hitting streak began June 13 and is now the third-longest in Angels history. Rod Carew is second at 25 games and Garret Anderson's club record of 28 was set in 1998.	“It's exciting and, yeah, that's all I got,” said Fletcher, who is batting .309.	It’s the longest hitting streak in the majors since 2019, when the New York Mets’ Wilson Ramos hit safely in 26 straight.	“If you’re around this guy enough in the dugout, in the clubhouse, you’ll always be in awe,” Maddon said.	RALEIGH’S DEBUT	All-Star pitcher Yusei Kikuchi’s move to the injured list for undisclosed reasons allowed the Mariners to bring up touted catching prospect Cal Raleigh, who made his debut.	Raleigh arrived about two hours before game time and had quite the get-to-know-you session catching Seattle's bullpen day. The switch-hitter was 0 for 4 with two strikeouts.	“I told him to pretend you’re in high school and just go play,” Servais said.	The Mariners also recalled INF Donovan Walton from Triple-A Tacoma and optioned CF Taylor Trammell.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Mariners: 3B Kyle Seager was again out of the lineup with a bone bruise in his right shin, but was not moved to the 10-day injured list.	UP NEXT	Angels: LHP Andrew Heaney (5-6, 5.38 ERA) will face the Mariners coming out of the All-Star break on Friday at Los Angeles.	Mariners: Servais did not announce post-break starters.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

LOS ANGELES -- — Max Muncy slugged a three-run, walk-off homer in the ninth inning, rallying the Los Angeles Dodgers past the Arizona Diamondbacks 7-4 on Sunday.	After producing just one run through seven innings, the Dodgers tied the game at 4 with three runs in the eighth, then scored again to complete the comeback a day after their historic 22-1 win over the D-backs.	“You like to think it carries over, but it doesn't work that way,” manager Dave Roberts said. “Our guys were still grinding and trying to take good at-bats. Fortunately, we got some momentum in eighth inning.”	The World Series champion Dodgers head into the All-Star break at 56-35. They have the second-best record in the majors, and are two games behind San Francisco in the NL West.	“It was nice to end the first half on a high note,” Muncy said, “and have a little momentum going into the break.”	Albert Pujols led off the Dodgers' ninth with a pinch-hit single against J.B. Bukauskas (1-2), and pinch-runner Zach Reks took second on Zach McKinstry’s sacrifice bunt.	The D-backs intentionally walked All-Star Mookie Betts only to bring up All-Star Muncy, who hit his 19th home run.	“It was a logical move,” Muncy said. “Thankfully, I made them pay for it."	The Dodgers equaled a franchise record with eight home runs in their rout on Saturday night, the most runs allowed in a game by Arizona. They took two of three from the last-place D-backs heading into the break, but went 3-4 this week.	Los Angeles kept up the longball barrage when Betts hit his 13th homer leading off the first.	Kenley Jansen (1-2) pitched the ninth for the win.	The Dodgers loaded the bases in the eighth against Noé Ramirez on a walk to pinch-hitter McKinstry and singles by Betts and Muncy. Justin Turner singled to right, and Josh Reddick tried unsuccessfully to backhand the ball on the warning track, allowing McKinstry to score.	“It's all maddening, it’s all craziness,” Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said of the team's defensive miscues. “There were certainly some plays that I felt we should be able to make.”	After Cody Bellinger struck out, Will Smith tugged on the red number of his jersey, letting plate umpire Todd Tichenor know he’d been hit. Tichenor agreed, forcing in Betts. Chris Taylor singled to right-center, scoring Muncy to tie the game while Smith was thrown out at third in a base-running blunder.	Arizona got home runs from Stephen Vogt and Daulton Varsho.	The D-backs head into the break with a 26-66 mark. Their first half included a MLB-record 24-game road skid last month.	“Losing stinks and nobody likes it,” Lovullo said. “We’ve got to go out and finish the job.”	Varsho homered for the first time this season — and fourth time in his big-league career — in the seventh, a two-run shot off Scott Alexander that extended Arizona’s lead to 4-1. He drove in Vogt, who singled leading off.	Arizona trailed 1-0 when Josh Rojas hit a ground-rule double to right field off Darien Núñez in the fifth. He scored on Josh VanMeter’s single to left-center, giving Arizona a 2-1 lead, before VanMeter got thrown out at second.	Vogt tied the game 1-all in the fourth with a two-out, solo shot off Tony Gonsolin. He gave up one run and four hits in four innings on 83 pitches after the Dodgers had hoped he’d reach 90. The right-hander struck out six and walked one in his sixth start since making his delayed season debut on June 9 after right shoulder inflammation.	D-backs starter Merrill Kelly was cruising along in the sixth when he gave up a double to Muncy, and then left due to cramping in his right leg in the humid, 88-degree conditions. The right-hander allowed one run and four hits, struck out three and walked one.	STILL STRUGGLING	Cody Bellinger, the NL MVP in 2019, was hitless in four at-bats, dropping his average to .176. He struck out swinging during the Dodgers' rally in the eighth.	BIG AL	Pujols stroked his 3,283rd hit, tying him with Willie Mays for 11th on the career list. He had two home runs in the Saturday night rout, giving him 675 in his career.	TRAINER'S ROOM	D-backs: LHP Madison Bumgarner (left shoulder inflammation) will be re-evaluated during the break. He allowed seven runs (four earned) and nine hits in 4 1/3 innings in a start in the Arizona Complex League on Saturday. Lovullo said Bumgarner's next start could be with the D-backs.	Dodgers: SS Corey Seager (broken right hand) will report to Camelback Ranch after the break, taking at-bats and playing simulated games. He'll be re-evaluated after next weekend. Roberts is hopeful Seager could rejoin the team for its homestand beginning July 19. ... LHP Clayton Kershaw (left elbow inflammation) is playing catch, but will shut it down over the break. There's no timetable for his return. “We don't want any more soreness,” Roberts said. “When he comes back, it's going to be a sprint.”	UP NEXT	D-backs: Haven't announced their rotation coming out of the break.	Dodgers: LH Julio Urías (11-3) will start Friday at Colorado in the opener of a three-game set.	------	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

SAN DIEGO -- — There haven't been a lot of big moments for the Colorado Rockies to celebrate this season.	On Sunday, there were two.	Minutes after the Rockies won Bud Black's 2,000th career game as a manager, Charlie Blackmon draped the purple MVP chain around his skipper's neck. The 3-1 win over Black's former team, the San Diego Padres, also clinched the first road series of the season for the lowly Rockies.	Pinch-hitter Chris Owings hit a go-ahead home run in the seventh inning and Jon Gray had another strong start for the Rockies, who took two of three and have won five of six overall against the Padres, including a three-game sweep at Coors Field June 14-16.	“Today was an example of players playing hard," Black said. "Jon Gray pitched great, a couple of big swings from a couple of veteran players, which is good to see; proud of the group the way we’re battling. I’ll remember this one. I will."	The Rockies, who've been buried in fourth place in the NL West since late May, came in just 8-34 away from Coors Field. It took them until just before the All-Star break to finally win a road series.	“Well, our road record is what it is,” Black said. “It's not very good. We’re frustrated by that. We’re trying to find some answers to turn it around. We’re playing against a good team. They were putting it out there. We went toe-to-toe with them and we won two of three. The guys are playing hard and they’re trying to do the right things, and I appreciate that.”	Owings' homer off Craig Stammen (3-2) made a winner of Gray (6-6), who has pitched well in four starts since a stint on the injured list with a right flexor strain. Gray held the Padres to one run and three hits in six innings, struck out seven and walked three.	Jhoulys Chacín pitched two perfect innings and Daniel Bard pitched the ninth for his fourth straight save and 14th overall.	Gray didn't allow a hit after the second inning. He loaded the bases on a two straight singles and a walk opening the second but the Padres got only one run out of it, when Victor Caratini grounded into a double play.	“It was exactly what we needed, really,” Gray said. “We’ve been looking for road wins, especially series, all year long, and they’ve been hard to come by so it was nice to do it here in San Diego and everything worked out perfectly. It was a really good day for us.”	Owings homered with one out in the seventh, his first. C.J. Cron homered off Chris Paddack in the fourth, his 12th, to tie the game at 1. The Rockies added an unearned run in the ninth, when All-Star infielders Manny Machado and Jake Cronenworth each committed an error.	“To go where we want to go, this is unacceptable,” said manager Jayce Tingler, whose Padres won a wild-card series against the St. Louis Cardinals last year before being swept in the NL Division Series by the eventual World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers.	The Padres, who've been in third place since June 9 and lost seven of 11, lost rookie left-hander Ryan Weathers to an apparent knee injury in the third inning. Weathers fielded Gray’s sacrifice bunt and ran over to tag him, but landed awkwardly on his right leg and fell to the ground in pain, clutching at his right knee. After a few moments on the ground, he had to be helped off the field.	The ball popped loose on the tag attempt, putting runners on first and second with no outs, but the Rockies failed to score.	Tingler said afterward that Weathers was still having tests.	The Padres head into the break with four of their six starters injured. The only healthy starters are Chris Paddack, who pitched two innings Sunday, and Joe Musgrove.	All-Star Yu Darvish went on the 10-day injured list Sunday with left hip inflammation, retroactive to Friday. He came out of his start on Thursday night after just three innings, and the Padres said the next day that he wouldn't pitch in the All-Star game. Left-hander Blake Snell went on the IL on Friday with gastroenteritis, retroactive to Tuesday. Right-hander Dinelson Lamet has been on the IL since June 27 with right forearm inflammation.	Snell won't be eligible to return until the second game after the break, Saturday at Washington. Darvish won't be eligible until the fourth game after the break, July 20 at Atlanta.	The Padres haven't set a timetable for Lamet, who began the season on the IL and has been on it twice since, the first time with a UCL sprain and the second time with forearm inflammation.	2000 MAN	Black became the 62nd manager in history to reach the 2,000-game milestone. It was his 638th game with the Rockies. He managed the Padres from 2007 until halfway through the 2015 season. His overall record is 964-1,036.	“I feel good knowing that Bud’s back there making most of the decisions," Gray said. "He’s been a pitcher before. He can see what we’re reacting to in the game and he knows what’s going on. It’s nice having that. You don’t have to explain things. Bud’s right there with you. He’s on the same page.”	UP NEXT	Rockies: Open a three-game home series against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Friday night.	Padres: Open a three-game series at Washington on Friday night.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PHILADELPHIA -- — Travis Jankowski drove in four runs, Matt Moore struck out nine while pitching into the fifth inning, and the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Miami Marlins 5-2 in the first game of a doubleheader on Friday.	The Phillies have won eight of 11 to move within three games of the first-place New York Mets in the NL East.	“Any time you help the team win, it’s exhilarating,” Jankowski said.	Miguel Rojas had three hits and drove in a run for Miami.	Moore gave up two runs on six hits and didn’t issue a walk in 4 1/3 innings with temperatures in the mid-90s. Archie Bradley (4-1) tossed 1 2/3 scoreless innings of relief, and Ranger Suarez struck out the side in the seventh for his third save.	“I think I’m able to get to a different level, being able to execute pitches at a higher rate, trusting the target, trusting myself and trusting mechanics,” Moore said.	The Phillies jumped on Sandy Alcantara (5-9) for three runs in the first. Bryce Harper doubled with two outs and the next two batters walked. Jankowski followed with a broken-bat, bases-clearing double just inside the first-base bag.	“It’s a bit of relief,” Jankowski said. “Off the bat it doesn’t feel great. You’re praying for something to happen.”	Rojas’ RBI double in the second pulled Miami within 3-1, but Philadelphia extended its lead in the third with two more two-out runs.	Rhys Hoskins hit a routine grounder to the left of second base. But second baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr., playing there because of the shift, first charged and then backed up on the ball before booting it. Jankowski later singled home Hoskins, and Ronald Torreyes’ run-scoring single made it 5-1.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Marlins: 3B Brian Anderson (left shoulder) was scheduled to begin a rehab assignment at Triple-A Jacksonville on Friday. Anderson has been out since May 24. ... OF Jesus Sanchez was placed on the injured list.	Phillies: All-Star C J.T. Realmuto sat out the first game of the doubleheader. ... RHP Aaron Nola is scheduled to start on Tuesday in New York against the Yankees. The Phillies ace was scratched from his last start on Sunday in Boston due to contact tracing following 3B Alec Bohm’s positive COVID-19 test. Bohm is out until at least Wednesday. LHP Bailey Falter rejoined the club on Friday after also being sidelined on Sunday due to contact tracing. RHP Connor Brogdon is expected to rejoin the club on Saturday. ... INF Nick Maton was a late scratch after suffering a laceration of his right middle finger during batting practice. Torreyes started in his place at third base.	UP NEXT	Marlins LHP Ross Detwiler (1-0, 4.32 ERA) opposes Phillies RHP Zach Eflin (4-6, 3.88) in the nightcap.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

NEW YORK -- — The Yankees felt like they were hit by a truck this week.	“An invisible, microscopic truck,” ace Gerrit Cole said.	It wasn’t so hard to see what was missing Friday night.	Eduardo Rodriguez shut down short-handed New York into the sixth inning, Christian Arroyo and J.D. Martinez homered, and the Boston Red Sox three-hit their rivals 4-0 Friday night with slugger Aaron Judge and five other Yankees sidelined due to a coronavirus outbreak.	A day after the series opener was postponed for testing and contact tracing, Judge, third baseman Gio Urshela and catcher Kyle Higashioka were added to the COVID-19 injured list. They joined Yankees pitchers Jonathan Loaisiga, Nestor Cortes Jr. and Wandy Peralta, who have also tested positive over the past week.	Fourth-place New York was also without first baseman Luke Voit, who went on the injured list Friday with a bone bruise in his left knee.	“Every day is really important right now,” manager Aaron Boone said. “Today it was important we come out and play well and try to get a W and that didn't happen.”	Rodriguez (7-5) allowed two hits over 5 2/3 innings, retiring 10 straight during one stretch and finishing with eight strikeouts. Hirokazu Sawamura got the final out of the sixth, and Tanner Houck pitched the final three innings to close out Boston's three-hitter for his first big league save.	The AL East-leading Red Sox improved to 7-0 in the 19-game season series and beat New York for the eighth consecutive time, their best run in the rivalry since winning eight straight meetings from 2008-09.	“We have to have that focus walking in the ballpark every day, walking in those doors every day, and rinse and repeat,” Boone said. “The urgency has got to be absolutely there every single day.”	The Yankees were coming off a disappointing first half that ended Sunday when Houston’s Jose Altuve hit a walk-off homer in an 8-7 New York defeat. They’re now nine games back of Boston and likely to be without Judge and their other COVID-19-positive players for at least 10 days.	“The competitive side, yeah, of course we want to come here and win the series,” Boston manager Alex Cora said. “But the other stuff, it really sucks.	“It's not about competition," he added. "It's about human beings.”	Arroyo hit a two-run drive during a three-run second inning against starter Jordan Montgomery (3-5) and added a double off Domingo Germán in the seventh.	“When he's using the big part of the field, he becomes very dangerous,” Cora said.	Martinez connected against Justin Wilson in the eighth, lining his 19th of the season into the right field seats for a solo shot that made it 4-0.	Montgomery pitched three-run ball over six innings with three hits allowed, two walks and four strikeouts. New York failed to score with Montgomery on the mound for his fifth straight start, matching Bill Short in 1960 and Fritz Peterson in 1967 for the longest such streak in franchise history, according to STATS.	“I'm just doing my job,” Montgomery said. “Going out there, focusing on hitters, trying to get outs and keep us in it. I'm going to keep being a good teammate and supporting the hitters.”	Judge and Urshela have been among the few consistent performers in New York’s lineup this year. Judge is hitting .282 with 21 homers and a .901 OPS, and the slick-fielding Urshela is batting .275 with 11 homers and a .756 OPS.	New York promoted four hitters from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre: first baseman Chris Gittens, infielder Hoy Park, outfielder Greg Allen and catcher Rob Brantly. Outfielder Trey Amburgey was called up Thursday, when left-hander Zack Britton was activated from the 10-day injured list.	The 26-year-old Amburgey started in right field for his major league debut. He hit .312 with seven homers for the RailRiders this season, but he was 0 for 2 on Friday.	Allen pinch hit for Amburgey in the seventh and singled in his first at-bat this year. Park followed with a rally-killing groundout as a pinch-hitter in his first big league action.	Struggling Yankees closer Aroldis Chapman pitched a scoreless ninth, striking out one and walking one on 23 pitches.	OUT OF ACTION	At least one of Judge, Urshela and Higashioka was not vaccinated, the Yankees said. Boone said he expects each of the players who tested positive to be out at least 10 days from the time of their positive test. Some of the players are experiencing mild symptoms, but Boone said none has gotten seriously ill.	Players had another round of rapid testing Friday that revealed no other positives.	E-ROD'S RISE	Rodriguez missed the 2020 season due to complications stemming from COVID-19, including myocarditis. After a slow start this year, the left-hander has a 2.83 ERA in his past five starts, looking more like the pitcher who carried a 3.81 ERA over 203 1/3 innings two seasons ago.	“He’s the guy we saw in 2019,” Cora said.	THE WAIT CONTINUES	Boston had planned to start top prospect Jarren Duran in center field Thursday before that game was called off. The lefty-hitting Duran was formally promoted Friday but sat out against the left-handed Montgomery. He will instead get his first start Saturday versus Cole.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: Houck was called up from Triple-A. He's likely to join the rotation next week. ... INF/OF Marwin Gonzalez was placed on the 10-day IL with a right hamstring strain, and RHP Austin Brice was designated for assignment.	Yankees: Voit experienced swelling in his knee over the weekend and had it drained, but Boone said the slugger had lingering pain this week. The 2020 major league home run leader was expected to get a platelet-rich plasma injection Friday night, and there’s no timeline for his return. Voit had surgery on the same knee in March to repair a partially torn meniscus.	UP NEXT	Cole (9-4, 2.68 ERA) is set to face another AL All-Star on Saturday in Red Sox RHP Nathan Eovaldi (9-5, 3.66).	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

PITTSBURGH -- — Francisco Lindor left injured moments before Marcus Stroman and his New York Mets teammates got into a heated shoving match with Pittsburgh during the Pirates' rain-delayed 4-1 victory Friday night.	Coming off their first All-Star appearances, Bryan Reynolds homered and Adam Frazier hit a two-run single to lead the Pirates in a game delayed 39 minutes by showers in the bottom of the second inning.	Lindor exited in the fifth with soreness on his right side. Mets manager Luis Rojas had no further update following the game other than to say the star shortstop would be examined in the morning.	Lindor winced after grounding out to second base in the fifth. The four-time All-Star took a few steps out of the batter’s box but then peeled off toward the Mets’ dugout on the first base side.	“You never want to lose anyone in your lineup, but especially Francisco Lindor,” Mets catcher James McCann said. “That’s a guy you hope everything is OK and he’s back out there soon.”	In the bottom half, tempers flared and the benches cleared after Stroman jumped high in the air when John Nogowski lined out to first base to end the inning.	Nogowski began shouting and pointing at the New York starter, who walked toward him and barked back. It appeared no punches were thrown during a large scrum on the field, and there were no ejections.	McCann said the dustup was a “miscommunication” and that Stroman was initially upset with plate umpire Larry Vanover. Stroman, though, called Nogowski “a clown” following the game.	“That was uncalled for,” Stroman said. “I’ll never let any man talk to me like that. I’m not scared of anyone. Hitters get on first base and do the macarena when they get a broken-bat single. I don’t say anything. If he has a problem with it, I’m right here. I’m 60 feet, 6 inches away.”	Nogowski called it “no big deal.”	“That was a huge out for him to keep his team in the game,” Nogowski said. “Reynolds hit a big home run. Frazier had his big hit. That’s the focus for me.”	Reynolds’ homer came in the seventh and pushed the lead to 4-1. It was his 17th of the season, setting a career high.	Frazier’s hit in the second opened the scoring. He and Reynolds became the first Pirates teammates to start in an All-Star Game on Tuesday since Barry Bonds and Andy Van Slyke in 1992.	Chad Kuhl (3-5) got the win despite issuing five walks in five innings. He allowed one unearned run and two hits while striking out three.	“You just have to keep trying to execute pitches even when you’re walking guys,” Kuhl said.	NL East-leading New York managed only three hits and went 0 for 12 with runners in scoring position against the Pirates, who are last in the NL Central. The teams split four games last weekend in New York.	Stroman (6-8) gave up just the two runs on Frazier’s single in five innings while scattering eight hits. He struck out two and walked none.	Richard Rodriguez pitched a scoreless ninth for his 13th save in 15 chances.	Wilmer Difo also homered for Pittsburgh, a drive to the back of the right field stands in the sixth off Drew Smith that made it 3-1. Difo, Reynolds and Jacob Stallings each had two hits for the Pirates.	The Mets got their run in the fourth when Pete Alonso walked and scored on Jonathan Villar’s groundout. After winning his second consecutive All-Star Home Run Derby on Monday night, Alonso reached base four times on a double and three walks.	DeGROM UPDATE	The Mets have yet to determine when ace Jacob deGrom will make his next start.	He threw a light bullpen before the game, which would line him up to pitch Monday at Cincinnati. However, the Mets have not announced a starter for Sunday’s series finale with the Pirates and deGrom could get the nod.	DeGrom is 7-2 with a major league-leading 1.08 ERA in 15 starts this season despite being hampered by multiple ailments. He last pitched July 7 against Milwaukee.	“We want him to take the time off from a medical standpoint to come in fresher for the second half,” Rojas said.	ROSTER MOVES	Mets: Activated INF J.D. Davis from the injured list and designated OF Billy McKinney for assignment. Davis had been out since May 2 with a hand injury.	Rojas has no set plan on how he will divide playing time at third base between Davis and Villar, who started there Friday.	“When I get the opportunity, I’ll bang,” said Davis, who struck out in the seventh as a pinch-hitter.	McKinney hit .220 with five home runs in 39 games after being acquired from Milwaukee on May 26 in a trade.	LHP Stephen Tarpley was released. He allowed two runs without getting an out in his lone relief appearance.	Pirates: INF/OF Philip Evans was activated from the concussion IL and RHP Nick Mears was recalled from Triple-A Indianapolis, while INF/OF Cole Tucker was optioned to Indianapolis. Evans had been sidelined since July 6.	The Pirates had a roster spot open after placing LHP Sam Howard (right oblique strain) on the injured list Tuesday.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Mets: RHP Carlos Carrasco (strained right hamstring) is tentatively scheduled to make a rehab start Tuesday for a farm club to be determined. On the IL since the beginning of the season, Carrasco pitched two scoreless innings for High-A Brooklyn on Thursday in his first rehab outing, allowing one hit and striking out two. … RHP Corey Oswalt (right hamstring strain) is rehabbing at the spring training facility in Port St. Lucie, Florida, and had an injection to reduce swelling in his leg.	Pirates: RHP Duane Underwood Jr. (right side discomfort) threw a bullpen Thursday. … RF Gregory Polanco (bilateral adductor strain) has started running the bases.	UP NEXT	It will be a matchup of rookie right-handers Saturday night when the Mets’ Tylor Megill (0-0, 3.50 ERA) faces Wil Crowe (1-5, 6.05). Megill will be making his fifth career start. Crowe has given up a run in the first or second inning in 11 of his 12 starts this season.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

WASHINGTON -- — Jake Cronenworth hit for his first career cycle, Wil Myers had a grand slam and a two-run shot and the San Diego Padres set a franchise record for runs in a 24-8 blowout of the Washington Nationals on Friday night.	The Padres, who finished the first half by losing two of three to the Rockies, had 22 hits against seven pitchers. San Diego scored in every inning except the seventh as the Nationals allowed the most runs since the franchise moved to Washington in 2005 and tied for the most in D.C. history.	“That was just as relentless up and down the lineup I've seen our crew,” Padres manager Jayce Tingler said. “The discipline in the zone, just the grinding ability, making them come to the zone, laying off pitches out of the zone. That, for an extended period of time was as nasty as I've seen our group.”	Cronenworth had a two-run double in the second, an RBI triple in the third, a solo homer in the fifth and an infield single against the shift in the sixth. Jurickson Profar replaced him at second base in the bottom of the seventh.	“Just tried to put something in play hard,” Cronenworth said of his at-bat in the sixth. “I know I didn't put it in play hard, but I put in play and ... some luck involved and I guess that's how you put that one together.”	Cronenworth said he twice fell a single short of the cycle while in the minors.	Myers hit a grand slam to cap a seven-run second inning, and added a two-run homer in the sixth and an RBI single in the eighth.	Tommy Pham had four hits, including a homer, and scored five runs, and Jorge Mateo homered.	Padres starter Chris Paddack (5-6) allowed four runs in five innings.	Juan Soto had four hits, including two home runs, and Gerardo Parra had a three-run homer for Washington, which has lost five straight and 10 of 12.	Erick Fedde (4-7) allowed six runs in 1 1/3 innings.	Washington was without infielder Starlin Castro, who was placed on administrative leave Friday by Major League Baseball under its domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse policy.	“You know what, today was just a rough day all the way around,” Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. “I'm going to go home, shake this one off and be ready to play tomorrow.”	CYCLING	Cronenworth’s cycle was the third in Padres history, following Matt Kemp (2015) and Myers (2017). Charlie Blackmon of the Rockies (2018) is the only other player to hit for the cycle against the Nationals (2005-present).	ROSTER MOVES	Padres: Placed rookie LHP Ryan Weathers on the 10-day injured list, retroactive to July 13, with right ankle inflammation. Weathers was injured Sunday against the Rockies.	Nationals: Signed C René Rivera. The 37-year-old hit .236 with two homers and nine RBI in 21 games with Cleveland this season. ... C Jackson Reetz was optioned to Triple-A Rochester. … INF Jordy Mercer (strained right quad) was reinstated from the 10-day injured list.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Padres: Weathers, who suffered bruising in the back of the ankle, had been in a walking boot, but has since thrown without it. ... RHP Yu Darvish (left hip inflammation) is progressing and Tingler said the plan is for Darvish to start Monday at Atlanta. ... C Austin Nola (left knee sprain) caught five innings in a rehab start with Triple-A El Paso on Thursday.	Nationals: CF Victor Robles left the game in the second inning due to dizziness, according to Martinez. with an apparent illness. ... C Alex Avila (bilateral calf strains) took batting practice on Friday. Martinez said he's close to returning from the 10-day IL.	UP NEXT	Padres left-hander Blake Snell (3-3, 4.99 ERA) makes his first career start at Nationals Park. He won his only previous start against Washington in 2018 while with Tampa Bay, allowing one hit in seven innings. Nationals left-hander Patrick Corbin (6-7, 5.40) beat the Padres in his last start, on July 7 in San Diego.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

CINCINNATI -- — Willy Adames homered and drove in four runs as the Milwaukee Brewers rallied to beat the Cincinnati Reds 11-6 on Friday night.	Adames had a two-run shot in the fifth inning and then doubled home two more in a five-run eighth that buried the Reds.	After losing three straight to the Reds in Milwaukee before the All-Star break, the Brewers won the first of a three-game set in Cincinnati and pushed their lead in the NL Central back to five games.	“This team beat us three times in a row, so just getting a win against them, starting off the second half in a good way, starting off a big series in a big way, it was meaningful for sure,” Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said.	The Reds got a scare in the third inning when All-Star Nick Castellanos, the team's best hitter, was hit on the right wrist by a pitch. X-rays after the game showed no broken bones, but Castellanos could miss some time, manager David Bell said.	“It is not broken, so he’s pretty sore,” Bell said. “A little early to tell about tomorrow or this weekend. But great news that it’s not broken. It got him in a spot that it easily could have been broken.”	With the Reds leading 5-3 in the sixth, Luis Urías hit an RBI double against Tyler Mahle. Reliever Amir Garrett (0-3) came in and Jackie Bradley Jr. hit a bouncing ball deep into the shift that second baseman Jonathan India misplayed, allowing Urías to race home with the tying run.	Kolten Wong, playing his first game since coming off the injured list, singled home Bradley for the Brewers' first lead of the night.	Milwaukee reliever Brent Suter (9-4) allowed an unearned run in the fifth.	Urías hit a one-out homer in the eighth, Adames drove in two with a double, and two more runs scored on wild pitches by Ryan Hendrix to give Milwaukee a six-run lead.	“We took every advantage they gave us,” said Adames, who came over in a four-player trade with Tampa Bay in May.	“He’s getting huge hits,” Counsell said of the 25-year-old shortstop. “They come at big times, they change the complexion of games, and he’s doing it often. He’s been just incredible since we acquired him. He’s changed our team, and our team changed when he got here.”	Avisaíl García also homered for Milwaukee.	Tyler Naquin and Eugenio Suárez hit two-run doubles and Aristides Aquini homered for the Reds, who lost for the third time in the last 12 games.	“It was just poor,” said Mahle, who allowed five runs and six hits in 5 1/3 innings. “All I needed to do was keep the team in the game, and I didn’t do that.”	PERALTA GETS A REST	Milwaukee starter Freddy Peralta is sitting out the Reds series for rest, and Counsell said the 25-year-old right-hander likely won’t go again until next weekend’s series against the White Sox. A late addition to Tuesday’s All-Star Game roster, Peralta struck out Adolis García of Texas, Boston’s J.D. Martinez and Matt Olson of Oakland in the seventh inning, becoming the first Brewers hurler to strike out the side in an All-Star appearance. He’s has a 2.39 ERA at the break in 18 appearances (17 starts), with 135 strikeouts in 98 innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: LHP Antoine Kelly (shoulder) started a rehab assignment on Tuesday at the Arizona Complex League. RHP Dylan File (elbow) also is rehabbing there.	Reds: RHP Michael Lorenzen (shoulder) was activated from the injured list Friday. ... RHP Art Warren (left oblique strain) went on the 10-day injured list. ... RHP Jeff Hoffman (shoulder) is expected to wind up his rehab and could get a start next week against the New York Mets, Bell said. ... RHP Sonny Gray (rib cage strain) is expected to start Sunday after landing on the injured list July 8.	UP NEXT	The Brewers send All-Star right-hander Brandon Woodruff (7-4, 2.06 ERA) to face Reds right-hander Luis Castillo (3-10, 4.65) on Saturday night. The hurlers started against one another on Sunday but neither figured in the decision. Woodruff worked six scoreless innings and Castillo gave up a run in 5 1/3.	------	Follow Mitch Stacy at http://twitter.com/mitchstacy	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ATLANTA -- — Austin Meadows hit a single in the 10th-inning to score Brett Phillips from second base with the tiebreaking run, and the Tampa Bay Rays beat the Atlanta Braves 7-6 on Friday night.	With Phillips opening the 10th on second base, right-hander Jesse Chavez (0-2) walked Brandon Lowe before recording two outs. Chavez then gave up Meadows’ go-ahead single to right field, as Phillips slid across the plate and beat Abraham Almonte’s throw.	Freddie Freeman had four hits, including a two-run homer in the fifth. Austin Riley and Dansby Swanson also hit home runs for Atlanta.	Ji-Man Choi’s homer to lead off Tampa Bay’s fifth, an opposite-field shot he sliced just inside the left field foul pole, tied the game at 3-3.	Matt Wisler (1-1) had three strikeouts while allowing one hit in two scoreless innings. Pete Fairbanks pitched the 10th for his fourth save.	Charlie Morton, who won a combined 18 games for Tampa Bay the last two seasons before signing with Atlanta, allowed three runs on six hits and three walks in six innings. He had eight strikeouts.	The Rays tied the game at 6-6 in the eighth with two runs off Chris Martin. Joey Wendle’s infield hit drove in Wander Franco, who singled, from third base with the tying run.	After Rays starter Michael Wacha gave up a single to Almonte to start the bottom of the fifth, Freeman pulled a fastball from J.P Feyereisen over the right-field wall for his 20th homer and a 5-3 lead.	Wacha allowed four runs on five hits, including two homers, and two walks in four-plus innings.	The Rays cut the lead to 5-4 in the seventh. Wander Franco tripled to right field and scored on Austin Meadows' sacrifice fly.	Outfielder Joe Pederson, acquired from the Chicago Cubs on Thursday, did not arrive in Atlanta in time to be included in the lineup. He was activated and grounded out as a pinch-hitter in the 10th to end the game.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Rays: RHP Nick Anderson threw batting practice in Port Charlotte, Florida, for the first time since being told in March he has a partially torn ligament in his right elbow. Manager Kevin Cash said Anderson threw his fastball at 90 to 93 mph. “He came away from it feeling really good,” Cash said. ... RHP Chris Archer (right forearm tightness) is scheduled to make a minor league rehab start on Saturday.	Braves: RHP Touki Toussaint (right shoulder) was reinstated from the 60-day injured list and could make his 2021 debut on Tuesday against San Diego. ... RHP Ian Anderson (right shoulder inflammation) was placed on the 10-day IL. He won’t throw for seven to 10 days and then will be evaluated. ... IF Johan Camargo was optioned to Triple-A Gwinnett to clear a roster spot for Pederson.	UP NEXT	Braves LHP Max Fried (6-5, 4.71) will start in Saturday night’s second game of the series. He allowed one run in 6 2/3 innings in a 2-1 win over the Rays on July 30, 2020, at Truist Park. Tampa Bay hasn’t announced its starting pitcher.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PHILADELPHIA -- — Jesús Aguilar homered and drove in four runs, Starling Marte went deep with three RBI, and the Miami Marlins beat the Philadelphia Phillies 7-0 on Friday night to split a doubleheader.	Jordan Holloway (2-2), recalled from Triple-A Jacksonville on Friday as the 27th man, didn’t allow a hit in five innings of relief after Ross Detwiler opened with a scoreless first. Holloway stuck out six and walked two. Richard Bleier completed the two-hitter with a scoreless seventh.	In the opener, Travis Jankowski drove in four runs and Matt Moore struck out nine while pitching into the fifth inning to lead the Phillies to a 5-2 win.	Marte made it 2-0 two batters into the nightcap when he hit a 2-1 curveball from Zach Eflin (4-7) over the wall in right-center. Marte’s double to right-center made it 4-0 in the fourth.	“Marte gets us on the board early and then we were just consistently adding on,” Marlins manager Don Mattingly said.	Eflin then walked Garrett Cooper, ending his night. Aguilar followed with a three-run homer to deep left off Enyel De Los Sanos to make it 7-0.	“That’s a pretty good dagger when your guy is rolling good on the mound,” Mattingly said.	Eflin gave up six runs — five earned — on six hits in 3 2/3 innings.	“It doesn’t sit well with me,” Eflin said.	Philadelphia has won eight of 12.	Moore gave up two runs on six hits in the opener and didn’t issue a walk in 4 1/3 innings with temperatures in the mid-90s. Archie Bradley (4-1) tossed 1 2/3 scoreless innings of relief, and Ranger Suarez struck out the side in the seventh for his third save.	“I think I’m able to get to a different level, being able to execute pitches at a higher rate, trusting the target, trusting myself and trusting mechanics,” Moore said.	The Phillies jumped on Sandy Alcantara (5-9) for three runs in the first. Bryce Harper doubled with two outs and the next two batters walked. Jankowski followed with a broken-bat, bases-clearing double just inside the first-base bag.	“It’s a bit of relief,” Jankowski said. “Off the bat it doesn’t feel great. You’re praying for something to happen.”	Miguel Rojas’ RBI double in the second pulled Miami within 3-1, but Philadelphia extended its lead in the third with two more two-out runs.	Rhys Hoskins hit a routine grounder to the left of second base. But second baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr., playing there because of the shift, first charged and then backed up on the ball before booting it. Jankowski later singled home Hoskins, and Ronald Torreyes’ run-scoring single made it 5-1.	STARS SIT	Phillies All-Star catcher J.T. Realmuto sat out the opener, and Harper didn’t play in the nightcap after getting dehydrated in the first game.	OFF KEY	Chisholm followed his error in the opener with another in the nightcap on Luke Williams’ second-inning grounder behind the second-base bag.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Marlins: 3B Brian Anderson (left shoulder) was scheduled to begin a rehab assignment at Triple-A Jacksonville on Friday. Anderson has been out since May 24. ... OF Jesús Sánchez was placed on the injured list.	Phillies: RHP Aaron Nola is scheduled to start on Tuesday in New York against the Yankees. The Phillies ace was scratched from his last start on Sunday in Boston due to contact tracing following 3B Alec Bohm’s positive COVID-19 test. Bohm is out until at least Wednesday. LHP Bailey Falter rejoined the club on Friday after also being sidelined on Sunday due to contact tracing. RHP Connor Brogdon is expected to rejoin the club on Saturday. ... INF Nick Maton was a late scratch from the opener after suffering a laceration of his right middle finger during batting practice. Torreyes started in his place at third base.	UP NEXT	Marlins RHP Zach Thompson (2-2, 2.25 ERA) opposes Philadelphia RHP Vince Velasquez (3-4, 5.35) as the four-game set continues on Saturday night.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- — Nicky Lopez drove in four runs to lead the Kansas City Royals to a 9-2 victory over the Baltimore Orioles on Friday night.	Lopez cleared the bases in the second inning with a two-run single and again in the seventh with a two-run double out of the ninth spot in the batting order.	“It is a product of him getting over the stage of worrying about getting on the field every day, as everyone goes through,” Whit Merrifield said. “He can relax, play his game and it is perfect for what we are looking for at our nine-spot.”	The Royals built a 6-0 lead through the first three innings behind Lopez and the All-Star duo of Salvador Perez and Merrifield. Perez hit RBI singles in the first and third innings. Merrifield added an RBI double in the second and a sacrifice fly in the third.	"It was a good day all the way around," Royals manager Mike Matheny said. "I am really happy with the offensive production we had today and the aggressiveness on the bases."	Keegan Akin (0-5) gave up six runs on eight hits in three innings, with three walks and two strikeouts. Lopez did the bulk of the damage with a two-run single to highlight a four-run second inning.	“We didn’t have great pitch selection tonight,” Baltimore manager Brandon Hyde said. “Just poor pitch selection and didn’t miss many barrels.”	Merrifield went 4 for 5 with three RBI, including a run-scoring single in the seventh inning. Kansas City finished with 15 hits.	Danny Duffy tossed four innings of one-run ball, with a walk and three strikeouts. Josh Staumont (1-2) earned the win in relief.	Pedro Severino hit a solo homer in the eighth. Scott Barlow closed out the game for the Royals.	Trey Mancini put the Orioles on the board with an RBI groundout in the fourth. Cedric Mullins went 2 for 3. The Orioles finished with five hits and stranded six runners.	ROSTER MOVES	Royals: C Cam Gallagher was reinstated from the 10-day IL. C Sebastian Rivero was optioned in the corresponding move.	UP NEXT	Brady Singer (3-6, 4.52 ERA) will take the mound for Kansas City. Baltimore did not announce its starting pitcher.	------	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

CHICAGO -- — Lance McCullers Jr. and the Houston Astros have played their best against baseball's best teams this year.	Just ask the Chicago White Sox.	McCullers pitched seven crisp innings, and the Astros beat the White Sox 7-1 on Friday night in the opener of a weekend series between AL division leaders.	Michael Brantley homered and Myles Straw drove in three runs as the Astros improved to a big league-best 43-22 against teams with a .500 or better record — including a 5-0 mark against the White Sox. Yuli Gurriel added three hits and two RBI.	“It seems like they rise to the occasion,” Houston manager Dusty Baker said. “They know that we're facing good teams, and they love the competition, especially the good pitchers.”	McCullers (7-2) surrendered hits on each of his first two pitches: a leadoff triple for Tim Anderson that extended his hitting streak to 13 games, and an RBI double for Yoán Moncada. But that was it for Chicago against the right-hander, who struck out 10 and walked two.	“He was nasty tonight,” Baker said.	McCullers said he thinks he found something with his breaking ball during the All-Star break. He also showcased his confidence in his slider, especially against lefty batters.	“It's just become something for me. I honestly feel like I could throw it at will for strikes,” he said.	The White Sox won five in a row before the All-Star break, closing out a 6-3 road trip. But they were outplayed again by the Astros, who rolled to a four-game sweep in their first meeting of the season last month in Houston.	While the Astros have played well against baseball's best teams, the White Sox dropped to 16-25 against opponents that currently have a .500 or better record.	“I think they outpitched us, but I think we pitched better than seven runs,” manager Tony La Russa said. “You come out tomorrow and compete again.”	Dylan Cease (7-5) struck out 10 in 5 2/3 innings for Chicago. The right-hander permitted three runs and six hits in his first loss in nine home starts this season.	“It was solid. I kept us in it,” Cease said. “I don't want to say I handed them two runs, but I felt like I pretty much gave them the first two runs.”	Cease caught a bad break when Anderson looked to second on Jose Altuve's two-out grounder to shortstop with a runner on first in the third. Second baseman Leury García wasn't on the bag and Altuve was credited with an infield single.	After Brantley was hit by a pitch, Gurriel lined a two-run double into right field.	Brantley added a two-out solo drive in the fifth, and the Astros broke it open with four more two-out runs in the seventh. Straw had the big blow, a three-run double to right that made it 7-1.	“We had some guys have big nights,” Baker said.	MAKING MOVES	The White Sox reinstated reliever Aaron Bummer from the 10-day injured list and recalled right-hander Reynaldo López from Triple-A Charlotte. They also optioned relievers Matt Foster and Jace Fry to their top farm club.	Bummer, who had been sidelined by a strained right hamstring, recorded two outs in the seventh and was charged with four runs. López worked two scoreless innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: All-Star SS Carlos Correa was activated from the injured list. Correa was placed on the IL last week due to health and safety protocols. ... RHP Austin Pruitt was activated from the 60-day IL. Pruitt was acquired in a January 2020 trade with Tampa Bay, but he missed last season with an elbow injury. ... Baker said 3B Alex Bregman (strained left quadriceps) is progressing and could start a minor league rehabilitation stint soon. ... RHP Josh James (hip surgery) got two outs in a rehab appearance for Triple-A Sugar Land.	White Sox: INF/OF Jake Lamb (strained right quadriceps) was sent to Triple-A Charlotte to begin a rehab assignment.	UP NEXT	Right-handers Jake Odorizzi (3-4, 3.61 ERA) and Lucas Giolito (7-6, 4.15) pitch on Saturday night. Odorizzi is 2-1 with a 1.04 ERA over his last five appearances for Houston. Giolito struck out nine in 5 1/3 innings in Chicago's 8-3 win at Baltimore last Saturday.	------	Jay Cohen can be reached at https://twitter.com/jcohenap	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ST. LOUIS -- — Mike Yastrzemski hit a pair of home runs, Logan Webb pitched four strong innings as a spot starter, and the San Francisco Giants beat the St. Louis Cardinals 7-2 on Friday night.	Webb was a last-minute starter for the Giants after Kevin Gausman was placed on the Family Medical Emergency List. Gausman, a first-time All Star this season, left the team to be with his wife in Louisiana after she was hospitalized with pregnancy complications.	Webb, who was scratched from his start the day before at Triple-A Sacramento, allowed only a bloop RBI single by Tommy Edman in the fourth. He ended his outing by striking out Adam Wainwright with the bases loaded in the inning.	“I was just a little frustrated with some of the two strike opportunities I had, not moving the ball,” Webb said. “Other than that, I thought it went really well.”	Jay Jackson (1-0) earned the decision with 1 1/3 innings of scoreless relief in his debut with the Giants, including coming in to get the team out of a bases-loaded jam in the seventh. San Francisco won its 19th road game in its last 26 chances.	“It wasn’t the soft landing we were hoping for with Jackson,” Giants manager Gabe Kapler said. “We probably put him in the most difficult possible situation, both with the bases-loaded jam and then having to go back out and complete a whole additional inning.”	LaMonte Wade Jr. hit a three-run home run off Wainwright, breaking a 1-1 tie in the fifth. Yastrzemski’s three-run homer off T.J. McFarland broke the game open in the seventh. It was Yastrzemski’s third career multi-homer game and first since July 29, 2020, against San Diego.	“The production is a team event,” Kapler said. “A three-run homer is only a three-run homer because there are guys on base in front of them.”	Yastrzemski is now 9 for 10 with three homers against McFarland in his career.	“It’s just a guy that for some reason I’ve had success off, I can’t really explain why or how,” Yastrzemski said. “I think a lot of it is I’ve faced him in situations where I’m a little more locked in than at other times when it feels like big moments.”	Wainwright (7-6) had retired nine of the first 10 batters he faced before Yastrzemski’s leadoff home run in the fourth. He struck out seven and secured his ninth season with at least 100 strikeouts, second only in franchise history to Bob Gibson’s 14 seasons.	Wainwright said Wade’s homer changed the game.	“As soon as I gave that up, I knew we were going to have our work cut out for us,” Wainwright said. “So, it only takes a couple of moments like that to swing a ballgame, and tonight they got those moments, and we didn’t.”	Paul Goldschmidt extended his hitting streak to 11 games with a leadoff homer in the seventh.	St. Louis stranded 13 base runners and went 2 for 11 with runners in scoring position. The Cardinals have lost three out of their last four.	MOLINA MILESTONES	Yadier Molina’s single in the seventh moved him past Hall of Famer Enos Slaughter for fifth in Cardinals history with 2,065 career hits. He also played his 2,056th career game at catcher, tying Gary Carter for fourth-most in baseball history. He also made his 1,990th start at catcher, tying Jason Kendall for fourth-most in baseball history.	ROSTER MOVES	The Giants reinstated OF Mike Tauchman (right knee sprain) from the injured list and selected the contract of Jay Jackson. They optioned IF/OF Jason Vosler to Sacramento.	The Cardinals optioned LHP Brandon Waddell to Triple-A Memphis.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Giants: SS Brandon Crawford was removed from the game with a left hamstring cramp in the eighth after extending his hitting streak to 10 games with a single. C Buster Posey (left thumb contusion) resumed light baseball activities and is considered day to day, and IF Evan Longoria (left shoulder sprain) was transferred to the 60-day I.L.	Cardinals: RHP Miles Mikolas (right forearm tightness) threw a live batting practice on Friday, and RHP Jack Flaherty (left oblique strain) threw a bullpen session.	UP NEXT	The Giants will start RHP Anthony DeSclafani (10-3, 2.68 ERA) against the Cardinals and LHP Kwang Hyun Kim (4-5, 3.11 ERA) on Saturday night. DeSclafani is 7-4 with a 3.75 ERA in 17 career appearances against St. Louis. Kim pitched seven scoreless innings against San Francisco on July 5 and hasn’t allowed a run in his last two starts (13 innings).	----	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

DENVER -- — Julio Urías became the first 12-game winner in the majors, Will Smith drove in four runs and the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the coronavirus-compromised Colorado Rockies 10-4 on Friday night.	The Rockies were without manager Bud Black and five other team members due to health and safety protocols and contact tracing.	“Obviously they’re dealing with some things and for us to be nimble and be ready for whatever is thrown at us is important,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.	News of the outbreak came a day after Boston’s scheduled game in New York was postponed because of positive COVID-19 tests among Yankees players. Boston and New York did play Friday night.	In addition to Black, first base coach Ron Gideon and four Rockies players were not available Friday. Right-hander Antonio Senzatela was scheduled to start but was added to the COVID-19 injured list instead, along with fellow pitchers Yency Almonte and Jhoulys Chacín, and outfielder Yonathan Daza.	Bench coach Mike Redmond served as acting manager.	“What was craziest was we really didn’t know who was going to pitch, if we were going to play or not, what was going to happen,” Smith said.	Mookie Betts had three hits and scored twice, and All-Star Chris Taylor hit a three-run homer for the Dodgers. Every starter in the lineup had at least one hit and scored.	“Mookie got us started and guys behind him followed suit," Roberts said. "Julio set the tone early, attacking those guys. All the way up and down the lineup I thought we had good at-bats.”	Chi Chi González (3-6) was slated to start Saturday night but was informed Thursday he would be moved up to Friday. The Dodgers scored five runs off him in the first inning, three on Taylor’s 11th homer of the season, and two more in the fourth.	“I didn’t have much feel for my slider; that’s what he hit out, a hanging slider,” González said. “Feel for my pitches weren’t the best today.”	C.J. Cron hit a grand slam for Colorado in the third inning, but Urías (12-3) didn’t allow another run in 5 2/3 innings. He also had a single and scored.	“Just a first-pitch heater, kind of down and in. I dropped the head on it and it went out,” Cron said	Los Angeles added three runs in the fifth off reliever Justin Lawrence.	KERSHAW UPDATE	Los Angeles lefty Clayton Kershaw (left forearm) has been sidelined since July 7 and is likely going to remain on the injured list until mid-August. Roberts said it made sense to give Kershaw a respite.	“Not sure when he’s going to play catch again but we’re going to take this time to give him a breather,” Roberts said. “It made some sense to cut some of the season off and save some bullets for the rest of the season and throughout the postseason.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Dodgers: SS Corey Seager (right hand) will play a simulated game Saturday at Camelback Ranch, the team’s spring training site. Roberts said Seager will play five or six innings and get three at-bats.	Rockies: LHP Austin Gomber (left forearm tightness) made a rehab start for Triple-A Albuquerque, allowing three runs and five hits in four innings. Gomber was placed on the 10-day injured list June 20.	SHERFY ACTIVE	Los Angeles added reliever Jimmie Sherfy to the active roster and the right-hander pitched the ninth inning. Sherfy was claimed off waivers from San Francisco on Tuesday a week after he was designated for assignment.	The 29-year-old Sherfy was 1-0 with a 4.22 ERA in 10 games with the Giants.	UP NEXT	RHP Walker Buehler (9-1, 2.36 ERA) will make his second start of the season against Colorado and face Rockies LHP Kyle Freeland (1-3, 5.48) on Saturday.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- — Mitch Haniger didn't take much time off during the All-Star break.	Instead of resting to prepare for the second half of the season, the Seattle outfielder worked on his swing. After one game it appears the adjustments are working.	Haniger had three hits and Chris Flexen continued his mastery of the Angels as the Seattle Mariners held off Los Angeles 6-5 on Friday night.	Haniger said he worked on having better hand-hip coordination and allowing better separation between his hips. His two-run homer in the fourth inning helped extend Seattle's lead to 4-1.	“I feel excited for the second half of the season so that we can finish strong,” said Haniger, who finished a triple shy of the cycle and is 9 for 20 in his last five games.	Angels second baseman David Fletcher got two hits and extended his hitting streak to 25 games, tied with Rod Carew for the second-longest in franchise history.	Despite Flexen's strong showing, Seattle's bullpen nearly blew it. The Mariners held a 6-2 advantage going into the ninth inning before the Angels took advantage of a pair of errors, scoring three times to close within a run.	With runners at the corners and two outs, Paul Sewald got Phil Gosselin to line out to right field to preserve the win.	“The ninth inning was not really indicative of how we’ve played. We didn’t make plays behind him,” manager Scott Servais said. “It’s a tough spot for Sewald to come in but he got the job done.”	Kyle Seager also went deep for the Mariners, who have won four of five.	Flexen (9-3) went seven innings and allowed only one run on six hits with two strikeouts. In his last start against the Angels on July 10, he threw seven shutout innings.	Sewald earned his third save after Kendall Graveman gave up three hits and three unearned runs in two-thirds of an inning.	Flexen is 4-0 in his past six starts and has permitted one run or fewer in all but one. The right-hander threw only 79 pitches and got a lot of contact early in counts, but Servais decided to turn to the bullpen because Flexen had already gone through the order three times.	“It was a highly efficient outing. That’s where we want to be. I was able to make pitches when I needed them to make contact,” Flexen said.	Max Stassi hit his seventh home run of the season for the Angels.	The game was tied at 1 in the third before Seattle broke it open with three runs. Haniger lined a one-out double to the left field corner and scored on Ty France's RBI single. Seager then gave the Mariners a 4-1 advantage when he drove a fastball from Andrew Heaney (5-7) to right for his 17th homer.	Heaney went four innings and gave up four runs on six hits with four strikeouts.	“He didn’t have his best stuff. From the beginning he didn’t have that normal jump or carry on the ball,” Angels manager Joe Maddon said.	Seattle added a pair in the seventh when Haniger hit a two-run shot to left-center to extend the lead to 6-1.	The Mariners got on the board in the first when Luis Torrens' base hit drove in Haniger. The Angels evened it in the second when Stassi homered to right-center.	Los Angeles pulled to 4-2 in the eighth when Fletcher led off with a single, advanced to second on a wild pitch and scored on Jared Walsh's base hit.	The Angels took advantage of a pair of Mariners errors in the ninth to make it interesting.	Adam Eaton began the rally with a base hit with one out and advanced to second when Dylan Moore fielded Luis Rengifo's infield grounder but was wildly off target on the throw to shortstop J.P. Crawford. After Kean Wong struck out, Fletcher hit a line drive that went off Seager's glove at third base to drive in Eaton. Fletcher advanced to second when Crawford wasn't able to cleanly field the deflection.	Shohei Ohtani then lined a two-run single to bring the Angels to 6-5. Ohtani advanced to third on Walsh's single to right-center but both were stranded when Gosselin lined out to end the game.	NICE START	Eaton went 2 for 4 in his Angels debut, including a double in his first at-bat. The veteran outfielder was signed by Los Angeles on Wednesday after he was released earlier in the week by the Chicago White Sox.	THE SKID ENDS	Mariners prized prospect Jarred Kelenic, recalled from Triple-A Tacoma, snapped an 0-for-42 major league skid with an eighth-inning single.	Kelenic was called up in early May but was sent down last month after batting .096 in 23 games.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: 1B Evan White (strained right hip flexor) — who has been on the IL since May 14 — has elected to undergo season-ending hip surgery. Servais said the surgery is likely to take place next week. ... RHP Casey Sadler (right shoulder impingement) threw a scoreless inning with a strikeout during a rehab appearance for Triple-A Tacoma. ... RHP Ryan Weber was claimed off waivers from Milwaukee and will report to Tacoma. INF Wyatt Mathisen was designated for assignment to make room for Weber on the 40-man roster.	Angels: CF Mike Trout (calf strain) still does not have a timetable for when he can begin a rehab assignment because he still is not running at 100%. ... 3B Anthony Rendon will miss at least another two weeks as his hamstring strain is healing slower than expected.	UP NEXT	Angels RHP Alex Cobb (6-3, 4.23 ERA) has allowed only one earned run in 13 innings in his two July starts. He will be opposed by Mariners LHP Yusei Kikuchi (6-4, 3.48), who is ninth in the AL in ERA.	------	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

PHOENIX -- — Kyle Hendricks outpitched Madison Bumgarner in six effective innings for his 10th straight win and the Chicago Cubs opened the second half of the season with a 5-1 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Friday night.	Hendricks (12-4) allowed a run on six hits and struck out four to match the Dodgers’ Julio Urias for the major league lead in wins. He is the first Cubs pitcher to go at least 12 straight starts without a loss since Jon Lester in 2016.	“I wanted to set a good tone, obviously winning being the main goal,” Hendricks said. “It could have been a little better, I could have been a little more aggressive. I had a lot of long counts, a lot of baserunners, but made the pitches when I needed to.”	Pinch-hitter Jason Heyward hit a two-run homer, All-Star Kris Bryant had a solo shot and Patrick Wisdom added another for Chicago.	“These guys just came out and played nice baseball,” Cubs manager David Ross said. “We got the starting pitching, we got timely hitting, the big home run by Riz when they tied it up and obviously the pinch-hit home run by J-Hey was nice. It was just a good baseball game.”	Bumgarner (4-6) allowed two runs on two hits and struck out six over six innings in his return from the injured list. Josh Rojas doubled twice and had an RBI for last-place Arizona, which has lost four of five.	“It went about as well as we could have hoped,” manager Torey Lovullo said of Bumgarner. “He did a great job.”	Hendricks gave up Rojas’ run-scoring double in the third inning and worked out of a one-out, bases-loaded jam in the fourth after walking two. He was lifted for Heyward in the seventh inning, becoming the first Cubs pitcher with 12 wins before August since Lester in 2018.	Bumgarner was reinstated from the 10-day injured list after suffering left shoulder inflammation before the All-Star break.	The left-hander was sharp in his return.	Bumgarner gave up a run in the second inning on Javier Baez's sacrifice fly and Bryant, fresh off his fourth All-Star appearance, hit an 0-2 pitch out to right for a solo homer in the fourth.	Bumgarner also hit two batters.	“Overall, it felt good to get back out there,” Bumgarner said. “It was super comfortable being out five or six weeks, but I felt good.”	Wisdom hit a towering homer just inside the left field foul pole off Matt Peacock, and Heyward followed with his two-run shot to put Chicago up 5-1.	TIME CHANGE	First pitch for Saturday’s game between the Cubs and Diamondbacks has been pushed up to 1:10 p.m. due to Game 5 of the NBA Finals.	The Phoenix Suns and Milwaukee Bucks are tied 2-all in the series and play just a few blocks from Chase Field. Construction in downtown Phoenix also has led to multiple street closures, causing massive traffic jams during the NBA playoffs.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: INF Eric Sogard (left thumb) was activated off 10-day injured list and takes the roster spot of Joc Pederson, who was traded to Atlanta on Thursday.	LET'S MAKE A DEAL	After the game, the Diamondbacks traded veteran catcher Stephen Vogt to the Atlanta Braves for minor league first baseman Mason Berne.	The 25-year-old Berne was 3 for 12 with a home run and three RBI in five games in the low minors with the FCL Braves this season. He has a .231 batting average and .659 OPS with five homers and 27 RBI in 75 career minor league games. He was drafted by Atlanta in the 33rd round in 2018 out of the UNC-Wilmington.	The 36-year-old Vogt, a two-time All-Star with Oakland, batted .212 with five homers and 17 RBI in 52 games for the Diamondbacks this season.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks RHP Zac Gallen (1-4, 4.17 ERA) is expected to be reinstated from the 10-day injured list to face Chicago RHP Adbert Alzolay (4-9, 4.66) in Saturday's game. Gallen had been out since injuring his right hamstring on July 2.	------	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- — Jed Lowrie hit a game-ending, two-run homer in the bottom of the ninth inning to rally the Oakland Athletics past the Cleveland Indians 5-4 on Friday night.	It appeared the Indians were in line for a comeback win themselves after erasing a 3-0 deficit. But then Lowrie drilled a 1-1 pitch over the right field wall off Emmanuel Clase (3-5) with one out, after Elvis Andrus led off the ninth with a single.	Bradley Zimmer hit a go-ahead homer in the seventh for Cleveland, which had its three-game winning streak snapped. Roberto Perez also went deep for the Indians.	Lowrie’s walk-off drive added to an impressive bounce-back season for the veteran second baseman.	Injuries limited him to just nine games with the New York Mets over the past two seasons. But he signed with Oakland on a minor league deal this spring, and his 45 RBI are second on the team.	“I’m not going to put words on it yet because it’s not over,” Lowrie said of his season. “But I’m grateful for the opportunity for where I’m at right now.”	Mitch Moreland homered for Oakland in his first game back from the injured list. Matt Olson and Andrus each had three hits, but the A’s were mostly held silent at the plate after building an early 3-0 lead.	Sergio Romo (2-0) struck out two in a scoreless ninth to earn the win.	Zimmer, hitting ninth in Cleveland’s lineup, hadn’t homered since July 28 of last season. But he got an 0-1 changeup from Yusmeiro Petit and drilled it over the center field wall to snap a 3-all tie in the seventh.	Clase entered the night having allowed just one homer in 36 2/3 innings this season.	“It hurts, but I’ll take our chances when we have a lead going into the ninth,” Cleveland manager Terry Francona said.	A’s starter Sean Manaea, who hasn’t won since June 14, was charged with three runs over 5 1/3 innings.	CENTRAL STORY	The A’s are 13-2 against AL Central opponents this season, and 78-22 versus the division dating to June 23, 2017.	ELVIS ENTERTAINS	Along with his three hits, Andrus made an outstanding play at shortstop in the third, a backhanded diving catch of Cesar Hernandez’s liner and throw to second to double off Zimmer. That bailed Manaea out of a potential jam.	“I was sure it was going to be a hit,” Manaea said. “It was crazy, and then he just acts so casual with the throw to second.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Indians: OF Jordan Luplow, working back from a sprained left ankle, will continue his progression of minor league rehab assignments by joining Triple-A Columbus on Monday “if all goes well,” Francona said.	Athletics: OF Mark Canha went through an on-field workout and both manager Bob Melvin and Canha were optimistic he’ll be able to come off the injured list this weekend. He’s dealing with inflammation in both hips. ... The A’s reinstated Moreland from the injured list and designated 1B/DH Frank Schwindel for assignment. Moreland went on the IL on July 4. ... RHP Chris Bassitt, who pitched in relief during Tuesday night’s All-Star Game, is likely to start Sunday’s series finale.	UP NEXT	Cleveland RHP Cal Quantrill (1-2, 4.23 ERA), a first-round draft pick by the Padres out of nearby Stanford in 2016, makes his ninth start and 27th appearance of 2021 looking to win consecutive outings. RHP Frankie Montas (8-7, 4.41) pitches for Oakland.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

DETROIT -- — Robbie Grossman hit a leadoff homer and four Detroit pitchers combined on a two-hitter, leading the Tigers to a 1-0 victory over the Minnesota Twins in the opener of a split doubleheader on Saturday.	José Ureña started for the Tigers and pitched three innings of two-hit ball before departing due right groin tightness. Daniel Norris (1-3) then got six outs, Kyle Funkhouser struck out the side in the sixth and Gregory Soto worked the seventh for his eighth save.	“Obviously, we needed our bullpen to pitch well and I think they wanted to prove something,” Detroit manager A.J. Hinch said. “All three guys came in and were great.”	The Twins were shut out for the fourth time this season. They swept a four-game home series from Detroit prior to the All-Star break.	“If you look at what both teams did offensively today through seven innings of play, they’re probably not the types of at-bats we’re used to seeing from some of these guys lately,” Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. “I’ll bet some of that is from five days off.”	The teams were supposed to play a doubleheader on Friday, but it was postponed due to inclement weather.	“This was huge,” Norris said. “That series back before the break, that hurt. It stung a bit because we’d been playing so well and we wanted to finish the first half on a high note. But they play good ball and they battle. So today was big to get that win and stop the bleeding a little bit.”	Minnesota left-hander Charlie Barnes (0-1) pitched 4 2/3 innings of four-hit ball in his big league debut. He was promoted from Triple-A St. Paul.	Grossman connected for his third career leadoff homer.	“Got the first hitter out of the way,” Barnes said. “Couldn’t do much worse than that and then we went from there. ... I made a bad pitch. Good pitches get hitters out and I didn’t make a good one.”	Detroit put two runners on in the fourth and three in the fifth but failed to build on its lead.	WORTH NOTING	It was the first game in franchise history in which the Tigers hit a home run in their first at-bat of the game, and went on to a 1-0 win. The last time it happened in the majors was Nick Markakis for Baltimore against Seattle on Aug. 3, 2014.	ROSTER MOVES	Twins: RHP Derek Law was placed on the 10-day injured list IL with a right shoulder impingement and LHP Danny Coulombe was placed on the paternity list. RHP Beau Burrows and LHP Juan Minaya were recalled from Triple-A St. Paul.	Tigers: OF Nomar Mazara was designated for assignment and INF Willi Castro was optioned to Triple-A Toledo. OF Derek Hill and INF Isaac Paredes were recalled from Toledo. … RHP Will Vest, a Rule 5 draft selection, was returned to Detroit from Seattle.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Twins: LHP Devin Smeltzer, who had been sidelined due to left elbow inflammation, is now dealing with a back injury, according to manager Rocco Baldelli.	Tigers: SS Niko Goodrum was scratched due to left calf tightness. … RHP Michael Fulmer (right cervical spine strain) will throw a bullpen session this weekend.	UP NEXT	Twins RHP Kenta Maeda (4-3, 4.66 ERA) will oppose Tigers LHP Tyler Alexander (1-1, 4.31 ERA) in the second game of the doubleheader. Maeda is 2-2 with a 3.86 ERA in six career starts against Detroit. Alexander will be making his third start this season but hasn’t pitched more than three innings.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- — Franmil Reyes hit his 15th home run into a luxury suite in center field, and the Cleveland Indians beat the Oakland Athletics 3-2 on Saturday.	Cal Quantrill threw five effective innings to win his second consecutive start. Cesar Hernandez had an RBI double and Austin Hedges added two hits as the Indians won their fourth in five games.	James Karinchak retired Elvis Andrus with two on to save it.	Reyes crushed an 0-1 pitch from J.B. Wendelken high over the center field fence for a solo shot that gave Cleveland a 3-1 lead in the eighth. The ball traveled a projected 437 feet into an open window of a luxury suite where a handful of fans were sitting.	“I feel like I hit balls harder than that. That one just carried more than the other ones,” said Reyes, who had struck out twice and grounded out in his first three at-bats. “But it felt great running around the bases, getting the homer (at) a great time. One more run to add to the lead.”	It was the fourth home run by the Indians’ cleanup hitter since coming off the injured list July 2.	Quantrill (2-2) struck out five and allowed one run while pitching around traffic much of the game.	The right-hander, who began the season in Cleveland’s bullpen, worked out of a bases-loaded, no-out jam in the fifth after giving up an infield single to Tony Kemp and hitting the next two batters on consecutive pitches. Quantrill got Andrus to ground into a 5-2-3 double play, walked Matt Olson, and then retired Mitch Moreland on a flyout.	“He had a couple of tough innings but gets that double play and then pitches out of it,” Indians manager Terry Francona said. “It wasn’t easy all the time but he did it. Obviously that was huge.”	Nick Sandlin, Bryan Shaw and Emmanuel Clase retired three batters apiece. Karinchak pitched the ninth for his 10th save, allowing a run on two hits and a walk. After he got Andrus on a grounder for the final out, the play was reviewed and the call confirmed.	Hernandez hit a run-scoring double that set up Amed Rosario’s sacrifice fly in the fifth.	Olson doubled and scored on Moreland’s first-inning double for the A’s, who had won three straight. Pinch-hitter Sean Murphy had a sacrifice fly in the ninth.	“We have a lot more offensively,” Oakland manager Bob Melvin said. “Our potential’s more than we’re doing and have done right before the (All-Star) break. We got some runners on and had a chance to win. We just didn’t get a big hit there at the end.”	Oakland starter Frankie Montas (8-8) struck out seven in six innings. He gave up two runs and six hits.	LOVE TAPS	Before every at-bat Reyes taps each foot four times with his bat, a ritual he thought had gone mostly unnoticed.	“(For) my kids, my wife, my mom and my dad,” Reyes explained. “If you count, that’s eight.”	FAMILY TIES	Melvin was teammates with Quantrill’s father, Paul, with the Boston Red Sox in the 1990s. Paul Quantrill was a right-hander who split time as a reliever and starter during his 14-year career and had one complete game – a two-hitter against the Mariners on July 4, 1993. The catcher in that game? Melvin. “I don’t want to say it makes me feel like I’m old, but it does a little,” Melvin said. “I don’t even think (Paul) had a son back then. It wasn’t lost on me today that (his son) was pitching.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Indians: RHP Aaron Civale is throwing up to 105 feet as he works his way back from a sprained middle finger on his pitching hand. … RHP Shane Bieber (right subscapularis strain) is working with weighted balls but has yet to resume throwing.	Athletics: OF Mark Canha was activated off the injured list. Canha had been out since June 25 with a strained left hip. Skye Bolt was optioned to Triple-A Las Vegas.	UP NEXT	Athletics All-Star RHP Chris Bassitt (10-2, 3.28 ERA) takes a 10-game winning streak into Sunday’s series finale at the Coliseum. Bassitt’s streak is the longest by an Oakland pitcher since Mike Fiers won 12 straight in 2019. Indians RHP Zach Plesac (4-3, 4.11) has won three in a row.	------	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PHOENIX -- — A little rest did a lot of good for Willson Contreras.	The durable catcher capped Chicago's three-run ninth inning with a two-run homer, sending the Cubs to a 4-2 victory over the lowly Arizona Diamondbacks on Saturday.	Contreras had three hits and scored twice. He has played in 82 of Chicago’s 92 games this season, and manager David Ross said he benefitted from the All-Star break.	“He's carrying a heavy load for us this year,” Ross said. “For him to get his legs under him at the All-Star break and come through like he did tonight. That's the right-handed hitter he's capable of being. He's pretty good in the box.”	Chicago was down 2-1 before it rallied with two out in the ninth. Rafael Ortega doubled and scored on Robinson Chirinos' pinch-hit single off Joakim Soria (1-4). Contreras then hit a drive to left for his 14th homer.	Contreras said he took four days off during the break, and it "was really refreshing on my body. Of course I want to play every single day, but I also understand the body needs at least one off day.”	Rex Brothers (3-2) got three outs for the win, and All-Star Craig Kimbrel worked the ninth for his 21st save. It was career save No. 369 for Kimbrel, snapping a tie with Jonathan Papelbon for ninth on baseball's all-time list.	It was the Cubs' first win when trailing entering the ninth inning since Sept. 12, 2020, at Milwaukee.	Arizona wasted a strong performance by Zac Gallen, who threw 5 2/3 innings of one-run ball in his return from the injured list. Gallen had been sidelined by a strained hamstring.	“He was fantastic,” manager Torey Lovullo said. “Gave up one run. He was in control of every inning. ... Typical Zac stuff, a ton of swing and miss.”	Gallen said he wasn't surprised by his sharpness because he missed just one start.	“I felt pretty crisp once I got out there and was able to make some pitches,” he said. “I was able to shape pitches the way I wanted to. Overall I was happy with it.”	Gallen was visibly displeased when Lovullo pulled him in the sixth, and the two had a private conversation in the tunnel leading to Arizona's dugout.	“I felt like I still had more in the tank,” Gallen said. “In that sense we butted heads.”	Nick Ahmed and Josh Rojas each drove in a run for the last-place Diamondbacks, who have dropped five of six.	“It's like biting on an onion,” Lovullo said. “It's painful. It hurts.”	The Diamondbacks jumped in front on Ahmed's run-scoring groundout in the second, and Rojas made it 2-0 when he singled in Ahmed in the fifth.	Cubs right-hander Adbert Alzolay allowed five hits, struck out two and walked two in five innings.	The Cubs rallied in the sixth. Contreras singled with one out, advanced on a walk by Anthony Rizzo and scored on Javier Báez's double off the wall in center.	Chicago had a chance for more, but Kris Bryant to hit a ground ball to third baseman Eduardo Escobar, who threw Rizzo out at home. Gallen then was replaced by left-hander Joe Mantiply, who retired Jason Heyward on a line drive to center.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Diamondbacks: RHP Luke Weaver (shoulder) and RHP Taylor Clarke (shoulder) threw bullpen sessions. Lovullo said the coaching staff isn’t certain whether Weaver will rejoin the rotation or pitch out of the bullpen when returns. ... RHP Tyler Clippard (shoulder) threw 26 pitches in an inning of work for Triple-A Reno on Friday. His next step is uncertain, Lovullo said.	UP NEXT	RHP Zach Davies (5-6, 4.38 ERA) will take the mound for the Cubs against Arizona’s RHP Merrill Kelly (5-7, 4.46) in the finale of the three-game series.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PHILADELPHIA -- — J.T. Realmuto's two-run homer in the bottom of the 10th inning gave the Philadelphia Phillies a 4-2 win over the Miami Marlins on Sunday in a completion of a suspended game.	Saturday night's game was suspended just two pitches into the top of the 10th inning when severe thunderstorms rolled through the Philadelphia region and causing the second rain delay of the evening.	In the bottom of the 10th inning, Travis Jankowski started at second base and advanced to third on Jean Segura’s bunt. With the Marlins playing a five-man infield with one out, Realmuto powered an 0-2 fastball from Miami’s Yimi Garcia to the opposite field for his second career walk-off homer.	Jose Alvarado pitched a scoreless top of the 10th for Philadelphia on Sunday, stranding Miami’s runner at second base.	The game went to extra innings because of Jesus Aguilar's two-run homer off Phillies closer Ranger Suarez in the top of the ninth.	The regularly scheduled game is scheduled to begin close to 2 p.m. with the Phillies sending top starter Zack Wheeler to the mound against Miami's Braxton Garrett. Garrett is replacing the injured Pablo Lopez.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

DETROIT -- — Miguel Cabrera’s bloop single scored Jonathan Schoop from first base, and the Detroit Tigers beat the Minnesota Twins 5-4 on Saturday for a doubleheader sweep.	The second game was tied at 3 after seven innings, and the Twins went in front when pinch-runner Nick Gordon scored on a wild pitch by Joe Jiménez (3-1) in the eighth.	But the Tigers rallied in the bottom half. Schoop hit a tying RBI single off Taylor Rogers (2-4). After Robbie Grossman struck out, Cabrera dropped a hit into shallow center as Schoop raced around the bases.	“I knew they were playing deep,” said Schoop, who is not known for his speed. “I thought that I’m going to run as fast as I can, so if it drops, I’m going to score. I showed them that I’ve got some wheels when I need them.”	Detroit kicked off the doubleheader with a 1-0 victory. Grossman hit a leadoff homer, and four pitchers combined on a two-hitter.	José Ureña started for the Tigers and pitched three innings of two-hit ball before departing due right groin tightness. Daniel Norris (1-3) then got six outs, Kyle Funkhouser struck out the side in the sixth, and Gregory Soto worked the seventh for his eighth save.	“Obviously, we needed our bullpen to pitch well and I think they wanted to prove something,” Detroit manager A.J. Hinch said. “All three guys came in and were great.”	The Twins were shut out for the fourth time this season. They swept a four-game home series from Detroit prior to the All-Star break.	“If you look at what both teams did offensively today through seven innings of play, they’re probably not the types of at-bats we’re used to seeing from some of these guys lately,” Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. “I’ll bet some of that is from five days off.”	Akil Baddoo hit a three-run triple for Detroit in the second game. Tyler Alexander gave up two runs and four hits in 3 1/3 innings.	“We still felt fine (after allowing an eighth-inning run) with the extra-inning rule,” Hinch said. “Great job by our team to just hang in there. ... Miggy puts contact on with two strikes and I’ve said it time and time again, contact can be your friend.”	Josh Donaldson homered and drove in two runs for Minnesota. Nelson Cruz had two hits and drove in a run.	Twins right-hander Kenta Maeda struck out eight in five innings. He was charged with three runs and three hits.	Minnesota scored a two-out run in the first on Donaldson’s RBI single. The Tigers grabbed a 3-1 lead in the second on Baddoo’s two-out triple to right-center.	Donaldson led off the fourth with his 14th homer, and Cruz’s bases-loaded infield single tied it at 3 in the fifth.	ROSTER MOVES	Twins: RHP Derek Law was placed on the 10-day injured list IL with a right shoulder impingement and LHP Danny Coulombe was placed on the paternity list. RHP Beau Burrows and LHP Juan Minaya were recalled from Triple-A St. Paul.	Tigers: Ureña and INF/OF Niko Goodrum, who suffered a left calf contusion prior to Game 1, were placed on the 10-day IL. RHP Alex Lange and OF Victor Reyes were recalled from Triple-A Toledo prior to the nightcap.	UP NEXT	Twins LHP J.A. Happ (5-4, 5.90 ERA) will oppose Tigers RHP Wily Peralta (2-1, 2.08 ERA) on Sunday. Happ defeated the Tigers in his last start on July 8, striking out eight in seven innings. Peralta has allowed one earned run in his last four starts.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PITTSBURGH -- — Now this was Bucco Bizarro at its best.	The Pittsburgh Pirates swiped three runs Sunday when Mets pitcher Taijuan Walker mistakenly batted a fair ball into foul territory, prompting a wild argument in which New York manager Luis Rojas was ejected.	With the bases loaded and one out in the first inning, Kevin Newman hit a dribbler down the third base line. The ball started out in foul territory, but then began spinning back toward the line.	Walker swooped in and swatted at the ball, trying to make contact while it was still in foul ground. But TV replays showed the ball was touching the chalk when Walker hit it, and plate umpire Jeremy Riggs correctly called it a fair ball.	The ball rolled toward the Pirates dugout and the Mets did not react to retrieve it as all three Pittsburgh runners took off and came around to score.	Rojas immediately ran out to argue the call and was quickly ejected. Walker was charged with an error on the play, while Newman was credited with a single and one RBI.	Walker, in his first outing since pitching in the All-Star Game on Tuesday night, then walked pitcher JT Brubaker and was pulled from the game. He allowed six runs on four hit and four walks while recording just one out.	------	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

WASHINGTON -- — Being back on the field was normal for Ryan Zimmerman, even if the circumstances were far from routine for any of the Washington Nationals and San Diego Padres.	Four relievers combined to toss four scoreless innings and the Padres defeated Washington 10-4 Sunday in the completion of a game suspended the previous night because of a shooting outside Nationals Park.	“I think last night was obviously something none of us had ever experienced," said Zimmerman, the longtime Nationals star. "Coming to finish a game under those circumstances was a little bit weird for all us, but you have to move on and play the game. But it was definitely different.”	The game was halted Saturday night with the Padres leading 8-4 in the middle of the sixth inning. The teams were to play the regularly scheduled game later in the day.	When the shots were heard, it was not immediately clear where they were coming from. Star shortstop Fernando Tatis Jr. was one of several Padres who helped shepherd fans from the stands into the San Diego dugout for shelter in what became a chaotic scene as the crowd scrambled for safety.	The shooting, an exchange of gunfire between people in two cars, left three people injured, Ashan Benedict, the Metropolitan Police Department’s executive assistant police chief, said Saturday night.	“It doesn’t make the situation better, but someone shooting a firearm in the stadium would have been a completely different situation,” Zimmerman said. “Not that this situation is not bad. I’m not trying to say that this situation is not bad, but it kind of shows you hopefully that the stadium is secure.”	Tatis had his third four-hit game of the season and scored twice for the Padres, and Tommy Pham had three hits and two walks.	Pham singled in a run in the seventh after play resumed and a second scored on right fielder Juan Soto's throwing error on the play.	Zimmerman, who sat out the abbreviated 2020 season, hit his 10th homer season for the Nationals, who have lost six straight and 11 of 13.	Reliever Craig Stammen (4-2) pitched a scoreless fifth inning for the win. Starter Blake Snell, who missed his last start due to a digestive issue, was reinstated from the injured list Saturday and allowed four runs on six hits and four walks in four innings.	Nationals starter Patrick Corbin (6-8) gave up six runs on 10 hits and four walks in 5 1/3 innings.	Ha Seong-Kim’s two-run double gave Snell a 5-1 lead in the third, but in the bottom half Zimmerman snapped an 0-for-15 skid with a three-run homer to center.	San Diego got RBI singles from Tatis, Jake Cronenworth and Manny Machado in the sixth to push the lead back to four runs. Machado had three hits and two RBI.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Padres: RHP Yu Darvish (left hip inflammation) threw a bullpen session and remains on track to pitch Monday at Atlanta. … LHP Drew Pomeranz (forearm inflammation) was reinstated form the 10-day injured list.	Nationals: Manager Dave Martinez said RHP Stephen Strasburg (neck strain) felt some neck discomfort after throwing a simulated game July 9. After taking a few days off, Strasburg played long-distance catch on Friday and felt better. … RHP Joe Ross (right elbow inflammation) is still feeling discomfort and will not make his scheduled start on Tuesday.	UP NEXT	Padres right-hander Joe Musgrove (5-7, 2.93), who allowed five runs and seven hits over five innings July 5 against the Nationals, pitches the regularly scheduled series finale. All-Star Game starter Max Scherzer (7-4, 2.66) is looking to bounce back after allowing a season-high seven earned runs against the Padres on July 8.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- — Ryan Mountcastle and Ramón Urias each had two RBI, and the Baltimore Orioles ended a five-game losing streak by beating the Kansas City Royals 8-4 on Saturday night.	The Orioles got six consecutive hits in a five-run third inning as they chased starter Brady Singer and opened a 7-0 lead. It was only Baltimore’s second win in July.	“It’s nice to get those hits going together,” manager Brandon Hyde said. “That was our best game running the bases.”	Singer (3-7) gave up seven earned runs, the most in a start in his career. He lasted two-plus innings, allowing eight hits and one walk. His one strikeout matched his fewest in a start during his two seasons in the majors.	Kris Bubic pitched six innings in relief for the Royals, giving up just one run and two hits. He struck out five.	“He was terrific and everything we’d hoped for,” Kansas City manager Mike Matheny said. “That’s one for him to put in the memory bank of how he should be tagging the strike zone.”	Baltimore starter Jorge Lopez went 4 2/3 innings, allowing four earned runs and seven hits with four strikeouts. Paul Fry (3-3) worked 1 1/3 hitless innings for the win.	“It’s been happening since the beginning, but at the end of the day I need to (get) three outs,” Lopez said. “I have to find a way moving forward to get past the fifth inning.”	Carlos Santana had an RBI double for Kansas City.	Seven of the nine starters for Baltimore had at least one hit. DJ Stewart, Anthony Santander, Domingo Leyba and Pedro Severino all had RBI.	Lopez was pitching well into the fifth but was pulled after giving up three runs just one out from qualifying for the win. Whit Merrifield had a sacrifice fly and Salvador Perez hit an RBI single.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Royals: Reinstated RHP Wade Davis from the 10-day injured list and designated RHP Anthony Swarzak for assignment.	UP NEXT	Orioles RHP Matt Harvey (3-10, 7.70 ERA) faces his former team Sunday in the rubber game of the series. Carlos Hernandez (1-0, 4.98) pitches for Kansas City.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

CINCINNATI -- — Christian Yelich doubled home the go-ahead run in the 11th inning and the Milwaukee Brewers beat the Cincinnati Reds 7-4 Saturday night to widen their lead in the NL Central.	The Reds loaded the bases in the bottom of the 11th, but with an empty bench, manager David Bell sent pitcher Wade Miley up to pinch hit for reliever Ryan Hendrix. He grounded out to second to end the game.	After losing three of four to the Reds at home before the All-Star break, Milwaukee has opened this series with two straight wins to take a six-game lead.	“We fought back,” Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. “It's something we've done all year. I think we've been really good late in games, and the fight has been there all year.”	Both teams scored in the 10th. Yelich then began the 11th with a liner into the left-field corner off left-hander Sean Doolittle (3-1) to drive in automatic runner Kolten Wong.	An infield single by Avisail Garcia and a sacrifice fly by Jace Peterson drove in two more runs.	Jonathan India hit a leadoff homer in the Reds eighth to make it 3-all.	Yelich had an RBI grounder during a three-run rally in the seventh for a 3-2 Milwaukee lead.	The Reds scored on an error and Kyle Farmer had an RBI double off All-Star right-hander Brandon Woodruff, who gave up just two hits in 5 2/3 innings. He struck out eight and walked four.	Jandel Gustave (1-0), the sixth Milwaukee reliever, pitched the last two innings for the win.	“There no question there’s a lot on the line," Bell said. "It is tough to take loses, but we have no choice but to approach this the way we do — with toughness.”	WILLY SPARKS CREW	Willy Adames had three hits, scored twice and drove in a run. That’s after he had three hits and four RBI in the Brewers’ 11-6 win on Friday night. Since joining the team on May 22 in a trade with Tampa Bay, the 25-year-old shortstop leads the Brewers in hits (56), doubles (16), extra-base hits (26) and total bases. The team has gone 34-16 since his arrival.	BAD LUCK MIKE	Right-hander Michael Lorenzen, in his first action of the season after coming off the injured list with a shoulder strain, pitched the eighth inning for the Reds without giving up a run and played two outfield positions. But he injured a hamstring while scoring as the automatic runner in the 10th inning and likely will miss some more time. Bell said he'll know more Sunday.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: RHP Brad Boxberger left the game with shoulder stiffness after giving up the homer to India in the eighth. He is day to day. ... RHP Devin Williams was put put on the 10-day disabled list with elbow discomfort. ... 3B Travis Shaw (shoulder) will begin on-field batting practice on Tuesday. ... CF Lorenzo Cain (hamstring) is expected to continue his rehab assignment at Triple-A Nashville through the weekend.	Reds: All-Star right fielder Nick Castellanos wasn't in the starting lineup but isn't expected to miss significant time after being hit on the right wrist by a pitch Friday night. “It's not broken, but it doesn't feel good this morning,” he said before the game.	UP NEXT	Milwaukee sends All-Star right-hander Corbin Burnes (4-4, 2.36 ERA) against right-hander Sonny Gray (3-4, 3.19) in the finale of the series on Sunday afternoon. Burnes worked two innings and gave up two runs, taking the loss for the National League in Tuesday night's game. Gray is coming off a weeklong stay on the injured list after being bothered by a strained oblique before the All-Star break.	------	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP--Sports	------	Follow Mitch Stacy at http://twitter.com/mitchstacy	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.

NEW YORK -- — After a long night and a shortened game that was interrupted several times, the New York Yankees finally have a win over Boston this season.	Gerrit Cole struck out 11 and the Yankees beat the Red Sox 3-1 in a contest called after six innings because of heavy rain Saturday.	Gary Sánchez and Gleyber Torres hit back-to-back homers in the sixth off Hirokazu Sawamura (4-1) as the Yankees topped their longtime rivals for the first time in eight meetings this year. It was their first victory over Boston in nine tries since Sept. 19.	“I thought it was a big win,” Cole said. “I thought out of the seven losses to this point, there were a few games that we were in, maybe even could have finished off with a W."	Cole (10-4) followed up last Saturday's 129-pitch shutout in Houston by allowing one run and five hits in a six-inning complete game. His seventh double-digit strikeout game this season came nearly three weeks after he allowed three homers to the Red Sox at Fenway Park.	“He leaned on a little bit of everything,” Boone said. “I thought his fastball got really, really strong as the outing went on.”	The game began 52 minutes late due to a weather delay even though it wasn't raining and the tarp was not placed on the field.	“We started the game knowing that there was rain in the area,” plate umpire Jeff Nelson told a pool reporter. “There was not a 100% forecast either way of what was going to happen.”	Play also was halted before the Yankees took a 3-1 lead when a fan threw a ball at Boston left fielder Alex Verdugo and hit him in the back.	"It felt like it was targeted towards me and it don’t sit well with me,” Verdugo said.	Verdugo began yelling at fans and was restrained by first base coach Tom Goodwin. Red Sox manager Alex Cora briefly pulled his players off the field, and the game resumed after a discussion with umpires near Boston’s dugout.	“This is just a game,” Cora said. “It’s a game. It’s not life and death and it’s not this drama, and the fact that people come to the ballpark and they decided to throw a baseball (at) one of the players, I was in shock that that happened."	Verdugo said he threw the ball into the stands to a young Red Sox fan, but a Yankees fan intercepted it and threw it back onto the field and hit Verdugo.	“It’s awful, embarrassing, unacceptable,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said.	There also were four delays for replay reviews and another stoppage when Nelson took a 96 mph fastball from Cole off his mask in the sixth. Nelson was attended to by a Yankees trainer and stayed in the game after a few minutes.	As Nelson was getting checked, the rain significantly intensified and Cole paced the mound.	The game was delayed by rain for a second time moments after Cole took the mound for the seventh, and called following a 54-minute delay that included lightning and heavy showers.	“It got pretty bad there at the end,” Boone said. “I actually ended up walking out with Gerrit and just looked at the umpires like, what are we doing? And actually being out there, it was not good.”	Sánchez snapped a 1-all tie with his 16th homer, and the call was upheld via replay review after a fan in the right field seats appeared to reach over the wall. Torres made it 3-1 with his first homer since June 5.	DJ LeMahieu hit an RBI single for the Yankees, who were blanked in the first 13 innings of the series.	The rain began as Rougned Odor batted in the first inning and was hit by a pitch when Nathan Eovaldi appeared to struggle gripping the ball.	Eovaldi allowed one run and two hits in five innings. He struck out seven and walked one.	Eovaldi lost his no-hit bid on his 80th pitch when Greg Allen roped an elevated 98 mph fastball into the right-center gap for a double in the fifth. Allen scored when LeMahieu singled to left, but Eovaldi escaped by retiring Giancarlo Stanton for a third time.	Christian Arroyo hit an RBI single in the second for the Red Sox.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Red Sox: LHP Chris Sale threw a bullpen two days after pitching in a game for the first time since Tommy John surgery on March 30, 2020. Sale threw 39 pitches in three scoreless innings for the FCL Red Sox and will make his next rehab start Tuesday for Double-A Portland. … SS Xander Bogaerts (sore left wrist) was held out of the lineup but is expected to play Sunday night.	Yankees: RHP Luis Severino was scheduled to face hitters but it was postponed due to rain. Severino will face hitters Sunday and could start a rehab assignment shortly. He has not pitched in the majors since 2019 after having Tommy John surgery, and his return was slowed because of a groin injured sustained June 12 in a rehab appearance. … RHP Corey Kluber (right shoulder strain), who has been throwing from 120 feet, could throw a bullpen by the end of next week. … OF Clint Frazier (vertigo) will see an eye specialist Monday. ... LF Tim Locastro exited after the first inning and an MRI showed a torn ACL. He injured his knee crashing into the wall in foul territory to catch a fly ball by Verdugo.	UP NEXT	LHP Martín Pérez (7-5, 4.04 ERA) starts for Boston against RHP Jameson Taillon (4-4, 4.90) in the series finale Sunday night.	------	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

CHICAGO -- — Lucas Giolito said he wanted to “come out with a vengeance” in his first start after the All-Star break.	The Houston Astros felt the wrath of the Chicago White Sox ace right hander.	Giolito pitched a three-hitter, José Abreu launched a three-run homer and the White Sox beat the Astros 10-1 on Saturday night.	Tim Anderson, Zack Collins and rookies Gavin Sheets and Jake Burger also went deep as the White Sox broke out against the Astros after dropping the first five games in the season series by a combined 34-9 score.	“I didn't really like my first half,” Giolito said. "Today was really a good launching point for flipping the switch.	“I thought I was convicted behind each and every pitch tonight, even the ones that didn't go my way.”	Most did.	Giolito (8-6) struck out eight and walked none while throwing 107 pitches in his fifth career complete game. After Michael Brantley doubled with one out in the first, Giolito retired 22 in a row before Abraham Toro homered with two outs in the eighth.	None of Houston’s first 16 outs against Giolito came on grounders. All were on fly balls, popups or strikeouts until Jose Altuve chopped the ball to third baseman Yoán Moncada for the final out of the Houston sixth.	“Lucas, he was nasty, man,” manager Tony La Russa said. “I think from the first pitch his stuff was electric.”	Anderson had three hits in the matchup of AL division leaders, and Burger's seventh-inning solo shot was his first career homer.	And the White Sox wanted to make a statement after the Astros had manhandled them through their first five meetings.	“We definitely needed that one,” Anderson said. “For us to go out and put up 10, hopefully we started something up.”	Astros right-hander Jake Odorizzi (3-5) permitted four runs and six hits in 3 1/3 innings. He entered with a 1.04 ERA is his previous five outings, but was out of kilter in one.	“I just couldn't find a consistent slot today,” Odorizzi said. “Not establishing fastball command was really the reason today. Just one of those days.”	Collins and Anderson went deep on consecutive pitches from Odorizzi with one out in the third. Both homers may have been boosted from a steady breeze that was blowing out, but Odorizzi made mistakes on both pitches.	“He really got hurt on the first couple of homers,” manager Dusty Baker said. "They were up over the plate and they didn't miss them.	“I guess it was their night. We had beaten them five in a row.”	Sheets made it 6-0 with a two-run drive off Brandon Bielak in the fifth, and Abreu’s 16th homer was a three-run shot to left against Joe Smith in the sixth.	MOVING UP	Abreu’s homer was No. 214 for his career, moving him into a tie for fourth place with Carlton Fisk on the franchise list.	STAYING ON THE SOUTH SIDE	The White Sox and All-Star right-hander Lance Lynn agreed to a $38 million, two-year contract extension. The 34-year-old Lynn is 9-3 with an AL-best 1.99 ERA in 16 starts in his first season with Chicago.	“There’s no point in going into free agency if you know where you want to be,” Lynn said. “They’ve put together a winner here. That’s what I want to be part of and help to kind of push it over the top to get a championship.”	Lynn will make $18.5 million in each of the next two seasons. The White Sox have an $18 million option for 2024 with a $1 million buyout.	MOUNTAIN RECHARGE	Giolito said he and he wife took a trip to Lake Tahoe to get away from baseball during the All-Star break. Then the couple hung out with their pets and Giolito said he “came back here ready to go.”	Baker agreed.	“He was getting the ball and he was rushing us,” Baker said. “He had his tempo up and his timing together.”	TRAINER’S ROOM	Astros: Baker hopes RHP Zack Greinke (shoulder soreness) will be able to start Monday against Cleveland. Greinke was removed after four innings in his last start, on July 10 against the Yankees. ... INF Aledmys Díaz (fractured left hand) started a rehab stint in the rookie level Gulf Coast League on Saturday. ... RHP Pedro Báez (shoulder soreness) is scheduled to pitch Sunday at Houston’s Low-A affiliate in Fayetteville, North Carolina.	White Sox: Manager Tony La Russa said RHP Evan Marshall (strained right elbow) has resumed throwing the ball, but not off the mound or in the bullpen. There’s no timetable for his return.	UP NEXT	Houston LHP Framber Valdez (5-1, 2.98 ERA) faces Chicago LHP Carlos Rodón (7-3, 2.31 ERA) on Sunday afternoon. Rodón was on the AL All-Star team, but didn’t pitch Tuesday in Denver.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ST. LOUIS -- — Kwang Hyun Kim didn't necessarily need a translator. His smile said it all.	The St. Louis left-hander tossed six shutout innings, Tyler O’Neill and Paul Goldschmidt homered and the Cardinals beat San Francisco 3-1 on Saturday night, snapping the Giants' five-game winning streak.	The South Korean-born Kim (5-5) has not allowed a run over his last 21 innings, covering three-plus starts. He was pitching in front of his wife and two children for the first time in the United States, which made the performance extra special	“I tried to be calm, not to get too excited," Kim said through an interpreter.	St. Louis has won eight of its last 10 games at home against the Giants.	Kim allowed three hits in an 85-pitch outing. He struck out one, walked two and left with a 3-0 lead. Kim has allowed one run or less in six of his last seven starts. His wife, Lee Sang-Hee, and two children, Minjoo and Minjae, arrived in St. Louis earlier this week.	“I can't imagine how good a feeling that has to be," St. Louis manager Mike Shildt said. “It's wonderful to have his family here, his kids here. It's clearly good to see him pitch so well.”	Kim tossed seven shutout innings against the Giants on July 5. He was in total command again on Saturday.	“He's been huge for us,” Goldschmidt said. “He gives us a good chance to win any time he's on the mound.”	Kim planed on celebrating with some of his mother's home cooking, which includes his favorite dish of Kimchi Chigae, a fermented chili pepper cabbage soup.	“My mother and I use the same oven,” Kim said. “But somehow she makes it better than I do.”	Kim said his recent success stems from his ability to keep the ball down.	“I just pitch low and my control is getting better,” Kim said. “Even though (it might be) a mistake pitch, the pitch is low and they get singles, not extra base hits."	Kim's family will return to South Korea late next week, but will not likely get to see him pitch in his next start. He said it was important for his children to see him perform in front of a large crowd.	Anthony DeSclafani (10-4) gave up thee runs on five hits over six innings. He struck out four and did not issue a walk.	Alex Reyes recorded his 21st save in as many opportunities this season. He has 23 successive saves, dating to last season.	O’Neill hit his 16th homer of the season leading off second inning. It was his first since a two-homer game on June 9 against Cleveland.	Goldschmidt, who had three hits and extended his hitting streak to a 12-games, hit a two-run blast in the fifth. Dylan Carlson led off the inning with a double.	"It was a fastball kind of middle away and down," Goldschmidt said. "I was just trying to hit something hard there. Worst case get Dylan to third and I was able to get it out of there.'	The Giants, who scored an unearned run in the seventh, sport the best record in the majors at 58-33 despite the loss.	KING OF THE CUP	Tampa Bay winger Patrick Maroon, a native of St. Louis, was in attendance Saturday. He has captured three successive Stanley Cup titles, including one with the Blues in 2019. Maroon received a standing ovation from the crowd when he was shown on the scoreboard in the third inning.	THEY WILL COME	The game drew a season-high 40,489 fans at Busch Stadium	TRAINER’S ROOM	Giants: INF Brandon Crawford was held out of the starting lineup Saturday after leaving Friday’s contest with a hamstring issue. He walked as a pinch-hitter in the ninth.	Cardinals: RHP Miles Mikolas will throw another batting practice session on Tuesday. He felt fine after throwing to several hitters on Friday. Mikolas is hoping to begin a rehab session later this month. He has been out since May 23 with right forearm tightness.	UP NEXT	St. Louis LHP Wade LeBlanc (0-2, 4.78) takes on RHP Johnny Cueto (6-5, 4.15) in the final game of the three-game set on Sunday afternoon. LeBlanc gave up three runs in the first inning of his last start — a 10-5 loss to the Chicago Cubs on July 9. Cueto surrendered four runs in six innings of a 6-5 loss to the Cardinals on July 6.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

ATLANTA -- — Joc Pederson hit a two-run homer in his first start with Atlanta, Max Fried had a two-run double among three hits while throwing seven dominant innings, and the Braves shut out the Tampa Bay Rays 9-0 on Saturday night.	Fried (7-5) did not allow a baserunner to reach second. The left-hander gave up four hits with one walk and had seven strikeouts. Fried’s career-high three hits included the  two-run double in a six-run fourth inning.	“The dude rakes!” Pederson said of Fried. “... He had some pretty swings, too. It wasn’t luck.”	Fried is hitting .333. When it was suggested he is making hitting look easy, Fried said, “Hitting is one of the hardest things to do in sports. I just had a really good night.”	Pederson, acquired in a trade with the Chicago Cubs on Thursday, hit leadoff and started in right field, filling roles held by Ronald Acuña Jr. before his season-ending knee injury on July 10.	Pederson had two hits, including an infield single to a vacant third base against the Rays’ defensive shift in the eighth.	“He’s electric,” Fried said of Pederson. “He obviously has a lot of thunder in his bat and puts together good at-bats.”	Pederson’s homer landed in the Braves’ bullpen behind the right-center wall. It was the highlight of a six-run fourth inning off Rays left-hander Josh Fleming (7-5).	“You see what the guy can do,” Braves manager Brian Snitker said. “He can hit good pitching."	The big hits by Pederson and Fried in the fourth were made possible when umpires declined to overturn a ground-rule double by Guillermo Heredia that landed near the right-field line. The Rays asked for the review to determine if the ball landed fair or foul.	Fried had a game-winning, pinch-hit single in the 10th inning of an 8-7 win over Miami on July 4.	“Fried had a pretty good day all around, at the plate and on the mound,” Rays manager Kevin Cash said. “That was impressive.”	Freddie Freeman added to the lead with his 21st homer off Fleming in the fifth. Fleming gave up seven runs on eight hits in 4 1/3 innings.	Fleming blamed “inconsistency with my sinker” for his struggles in the fourth. “Left too many over the plate,” he said.	Edgar Santana and Tyler Matzek each pitched one inning behind Fried to finish the combined four-hit shutout.	One day after trading for Pederson, Braves general manager Alex Anthopoulos stayed active by acquiring catcher Stephen Vogt from Arizona following Friday night’s game. Vogt was in uniform but did not appear in the game.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Braves C Jonathan Lucroy was designated for assignment to clear a roster spot for Vogt, who will share time with Kevan Smith. Snitker said the goal is to “piece this thing together” until starter Travis d'Arnaud (torn ligaments, left thumb) returns from the injured list, possibly by mid-August. Snitker said d'Arnaud's rehabilitation is “going well.” Lucroy appeared in only two games with Atlanta following his recall from Triple-A Gwinnett on July 7.	VERSATILE ROOKIE	Tampa Bay rookie Wander Franco made his first start at second base after playing shortstop and third base in his first 16 games.	“We certainly are appreciative of his versatility and will continue to try to use that,” Cash said, adding he sees Franco as “just a real special player.”	NEW LOOK	Snitker juggled his lineup with Dansby Swanson and Freeman hitting second and third, respectively. Freeman moved down one spot in the lineup. Swanson had a run-scoring double off J.P. Feyereisen in the sixth.	SAVING THE BULLPEN	Cash used catcher Francisco Mejia to pitch the ninth and protect his bullpen. Mejia allowed one hit in a scoreless inning.	Speaking through a translator, Mejia said Cash “came up to me and asked if I’ve ever pitched and I said no, but I’d be willing to go and I can throw strikes. That was the first time I’ve pitched in my life.”	UP NEXT	Atlanta's Drew Smyly will face Tampa Bay's Rich Hill in a matchup of veteran left-handers in Sunday's final game of the weekend series. Hill is 5-0 with a 1.74 ERA in nine career appearances, including seven starts, against the Braves.	------	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

DENVER -- — Max Muncy had two home runs and four hits, Mookie Betts had a homer among his four extra-base hits before leaving with a hip problem, and the Los Angeles Dodgers won their fourth straight, beating the Colorado Rockies 9-2 on Saturday night.	Muncy homered is his last two at-bats and finished with five RBI.	Walker Buehler (10-1) pitched seven strong innings to reach double digits in wins. He set down the last 13 batters he faced after yielding a two-out double to Ryan McMahon in the bottom of the third. He recorded six of his eight strikeouts in that span.	A.J. Pollock also homered, and Justin Turner hit a two-run double in the ninth ahead of Muncy’s second homer of the night, off reliever Zac Rosscup. It was the Dodgers’ eighth straight win over the Rockies since dropping the season opener at Colorado.	McMahon had a run-scoring double and starter Kyle Freeland had a sacrifice fly for Colorado.	Betts was running out his third double of the game in the top of the seventh when he slowed his gait and gingerly ran to second base. A team trainer hustled onto the field to tend to him and then walked him off the field and into the clubhouse. The Dodgers later announced that Betts was removed from the game with a right hip irritation. “It’s kind of been nagging him all year,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. “I think a lot of the running on the bases kind of caught up to him and irritated him a little bit. But I’ll have him down (Sunday) and he’ll be ready for that (San Francisco) series on Monday."	Betts also figured he would be able to play through it.	“I’m good,” he said. “I’ve been dealing with it. I think I just made it a little more bad today than normal. But I’m fine.”	Muncy hit his second run-scoring single in the top of the sixth to put the Dodgers up 3-2. He connected for his 20th homer of the season in the eighth off Carlos Estévez. Muncy said he has been able to zero in on an array of pitches beyond fastballs this season, making his overall swing much more effective.	“I’ve always been a really good fastball hitter, but this year I feel like I’ve been able to react to a lot of different pitches and it’s not just selling out to the fastball anymore,” Muncy said. “I think it’s making me more of a complete hitter.”	Pollock hit his 13th homer of the season in the seventh off Mychal Givens, extending the Dodgers lead to 4-2.	Betts, who doubled and scored on Muncy’s first RBI single in the first, put the Dodgers up 2-1 in the top of the third when he drove Freeland’s 0-1 offering over the right-center field fence, into the Rockies’ bullpen, for his 14th home run of the season. Betts accounted for three of the hits off Freeland, including his home run.	“That’s how baseball goes sometimes,” Freeland said. “You’ve got some guy’s number for a little bit, then they turn around and got your number. … I think I really made one mistake to him — and that was the homer. Other than that, the other two pitches were quality pitches that he put swings on.”	Colorado evened the score at 2-all in its half of the third, getting a run-scoring double from McMahon.	Freeland (1-4) went six innings and allowed three runs on six hits. He struck out four.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Dodgers: SS Corey Seager, sidelined since suffering a right-hand fracture in mid-May when he was hit by a pitch, could be nearing a return. Last year’s World Series MVP has swung the bat well in recent simulated games. He’s expected to have his status re-evaluated after going through another simulated game on Monday. … Betts was replaced by Gavin Lux after leaving the game in the seventh with a hip problem.	Rockies: Manager Bud Black and first base coach Ron Gideon, along with pitchers Yency Almonte, Jhoulys Chacin and Antonio Senzatela and CF Yonathan Daza missed a second consecutive game under MLB’s COVID-19 and contact-tracing protocols. … C Dom Nunez fouled a pitch off his right knee in fourth inning at-bat and remained in the game after walking off the sting.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: LHP David Price (4-0, 3.23 ERA) is slated to start Sunday’s series finale, his fifth start of the season.	Rockies: RHP Jon Gray (6-6, 3.77 ERA) has gone 2-0 with a 2.35 ERA in four starts since returning from the injured list (right flexor strain).	------	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

PHILADELPHIA -- — J.T. Realmuto's two-run homer in the bottom of the 10th inning gave the Philadelphia Phillies a 4-2 win over the Miami Marlins on Sunday in a completion of a suspended game.	Saturday night's game was suspended just two pitches into the top of the 10th inning when severe thunderstorms rolled through the Philadelphia region and causing the second rain delay of the evening.	In the bottom of the 10th inning, Travis Jankowski started at second base and advanced to third on Jean Segura’s bunt. With the Marlins playing a five-man infield with one out, Realmuto powered an 0-2 fastball from Miami’s Yimi Garcia to the opposite field for his second career walk-off homer.	Jose Alvarado pitched a scoreless top of the 10th for Philadelphia on Sunday, stranding Miami’s runner at second base.	The game went to extra innings because of Jesus Aguilar's two-run homer off Phillies closer Ranger Suarez in the top of the ninth.	The regularly scheduled game is scheduled to begin close to 2 p.m. with the Phillies sending top starter Zack Wheeler to the mound against Miami's Braxton Garrett. Garrett is replacing the injured Pablo Lopez.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

WASHINGTON -- — Being back on the field was normal for Ryan Zimmerman, even if the circumstances were far from routine for any of the Washington Nationals and San Diego Padres.	Four relievers combined to toss four scoreless innings and the Padres defeated Washington 10-4 Sunday in the completion of a game suspended the previous night because of a shooting outside Nationals Park.	“I think last night was obviously something none of us had ever experienced," said Zimmerman, the longtime Nationals star. "Coming to finish a game under those circumstances was a little bit weird for all us, but you have to move on and play the game. But it was definitely different.”	The game was halted Saturday night with the Padres leading 8-4 in the middle of the sixth inning. The teams were to play the regularly scheduled game later in the day.	When the shots were heard, it was not immediately clear where they were coming from. Star shortstop Fernando Tatis Jr. was one of several Padres who helped shepherd fans from the stands into the San Diego dugout for shelter in what became a chaotic scene as the crowd scrambled for safety.	The shooting, an exchange of gunfire between people in two cars, left three people injured, Ashan Benedict, the Metropolitan Police Department’s executive assistant police chief, said Saturday night.	“It doesn’t make the situation better, but someone shooting a firearm in the stadium would have been a completely different situation,” Zimmerman said. “Not that this situation is not bad. I’m not trying to say that this situation is not bad, but it kind of shows you hopefully that the stadium is secure.”	Tatis had his third four-hit game of the season and scored twice for the Padres, and Tommy Pham had three hits and two walks.	Pham singled in a run in the seventh after play resumed and a second scored on right fielder Juan Soto's throwing error on the play.	Zimmerman, who sat out the abbreviated 2020 season, hit his 10th homer season for the Nationals, who have lost six straight and 11 of 13.	Reliever Craig Stammen (4-2) pitched a scoreless fifth inning for the win. Starter Blake Snell, who missed his last start due to a digestive issue, was reinstated from the injured list Saturday and allowed four runs on six hits and four walks in four innings.	Nationals starter Patrick Corbin (6-8) gave up six runs on 10 hits and four walks in 5 1/3 innings.	Ha Seong-Kim’s two-run double gave Snell a 5-1 lead in the third, but in the bottom half Zimmerman snapped an 0-for-15 skid with a three-run homer to center.	San Diego got RBI singles from Tatis, Jake Cronenworth and Manny Machado in the sixth to push the lead back to four runs. Machado had three hits and two RBI.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Padres: RHP Yu Darvish (left hip inflammation) threw a bullpen session and remains on track to pitch Monday at Atlanta. … LHP Drew Pomeranz (forearm inflammation) was reinstated form the 10-day injured list.	Nationals: Manager Dave Martinez said RHP Stephen Strasburg (neck strain) felt some neck discomfort after throwing a simulated game July 9. After taking a few days off, Strasburg played long-distance catch on Friday and felt better. … RHP Joe Ross (right elbow inflammation) is still feeling discomfort and will not make his scheduled start on Tuesday.	UP NEXT	Padres right-hander Joe Musgrove (5-7, 2.93), who allowed five runs and seven hits over five innings July 5 against the Nationals, pitches the regularly scheduled series finale. All-Star Game starter Max Scherzer (7-4, 2.66) is looking to bounce back after allowing a season-high seven earned runs against the Padres on July 8.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

PITTSBURGH -- — Michael Conforto hit a two-run homer in the ninth inning to complete a huge comeback and the New York Mets overcame an embarrassing gaffe by All-Star pitcher Taijuan Walker to beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 7-6 Sunday.	Trailing 6-0 in the first inning, the Mets rallied to salvage a rugged weekend at PNC Park. The NL East leaders lost stars Jacob deGrom and Francisco Lindor to injuries, then dropped Saturday night’s game when closer Edwin Diaz gave up a two-out grand slam in the ninth that capped Pittsburgh’s six-run comeback.	Conforto connected off closer Richard Rodriguez (4-2), who blew his third save in 16 opportunities. Dominic Smith led off the ninth with a single and Conforto followed with his fourth homer.	The Mets lost four of seven to Pittsburgh in a pair of series surrounding the All-Star break.	Walker, who pitched in the All-Star Game on Tuesday night, hurt himself with a huge misplay in the first inning that led to an argument and the ejection of Mets manager Luis Rojas.	Bryan Reynolds hit an RBI single and John Nogowski doubled for a quick 3-0 lead, and two walks loaded the bases with one out.	Kevin Newman hit a dribbler down the third base line and the ball started out in foul territory, but then began spinning back toward the line.	Walker swooped in and swatted at the ball, trying to make contact while it was still in foul ground. But TV replays showed the ball was touching the chalk when Walker hit it, and plate umpire Jeremy Riggs correctly called it a fair ball.	Walker turned to argue the call as the ball rolled toward the Pirates dugout, and no Mets reacted to retrieve it. The three Pittsburgh runners took off and kept running, and all came around to score.	Walker said he tried to swat the ball into the dugout.	“Obviously, I thought it was foul,” Walker said. "It was so close. ... I thought I flipped it in the dugout. I didn’t even realize it was still in play. It was just one of those plays that just happen. Crazy play.”	Walker was charged with an error on the play, while Newman was credited with a single and one RBI.	Rojas immediately ran out to argue the call and was ejected. He said he wanted the umpires to conference to make sure the correct call was made, even though the play was not reviewable.	“I didn’t wake up this morning to get thrown out in the bottom of the first inning,” he said.	Walker said Rojas’ passionate defense helped the team get back into the game after a lackluster start.	“He was fired up for, sure, and I think that got the whole team fired up, to have our backs,” Walker said.	After walking pitcher JT Brubaker, Walker was pulled from the game. He allowed six runs on four hit and four walks while recording just one out.	The Mets began to rally with Smith’s RBI single in the third. In the fourth, pinch-hitter Travis Blankenhorn hit his first major league homer, a three-run shot to the riverwalk beyond right-center field to make it 6-4.	Jeff McNeil scored on right fielder Gregory Polanco’s throwing error in the sixth to bring the Mets to within a run.	Jeurys Familia (5-1) pitched two innings. Trevor May worked around a leadoff walk in the ninth for his second save.	CONFORTO COMING AROUND?	Conforto’s home run gave him three extra-base hits in three games since the All-Star break. He had just two in 19 games after returning from a hamstring injury in late June, while his slugging percentage fell to .277. Conforto slugged .515 with nine home runs and 12 doubles in 2020.	“He’s one of the guys that we’re waiting to catch fire, because he can help our offense,” Rojas said.	ROSTER MOVES	The Pirates reinstated right-handed relief pitcher Duane Underwood Jr. from the injured list and optioned right-handed reliever Nick Mears to Triple-A Indianapolis. Underwood had been out since July 8 with right side discomfort. Mears has not appeared in the majors this season.	The Mets placed deGrom on the 10-day injured list with right forearm tightness. The ace had been scheduled to start on Sunday, but was scratched. An MRI revealed no structural damage.	UP NEXT	Mets: Jerad Eickhoff (0-1, 4.97 ERA) will start a three-game series in Cincinnati on Monday. Eickhoff has appeared in three games this season and made one start. He last pitched 2 2/3 innings of relief on July 11.	Pirates: Chase De Jong (1-3, 5.59) will start on Monday as the Pirates start a six-game road trip with three games against Arizona.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

BUFFALO, N.Y. -- — Hyun Jin Ryu threw a three-hitter for his third career shutout and Danny Jansen hit a home run for Toronto to lead the Blue Jays to a 5-0 win over the Texas Rangers in the first game of a doubleheader on Sunday.	Ryu (9-5) went the full seven innings, striking out four and walking one in his first shutout since May 7, 2019 with the Los Angeles Dodgers against Atlanta.	“During the bullpen sessions I had before the All-Star break, I talked with (pitching coach) Pete (Walker) and we discussed how my arm slot and release point had been dropping a bit," Ryu said through a translator. "Today I was able to get on top again and that resulted in the changeup and the rest of my pitches to be a little faster than normal.”	The Blue Jays, winners of three straight, took a 2-0 lead in the third inning on an RBI groundout by Marcus Semien and a run-scoring single by Bo Bichette. Jansen led off the fifth inning with his fifth homer and Randal Grichuk added a sixth-inning sacrifice fly to provide insurance.	Kolby Allard (2-6) allowed five runs, seven hits and a walk over 5 1/3 innings for Texas, which has lost four in a row and eight of its last 11.	Ryu escaped trouble in the second inning with the game still scoreless. He allowed a leadoff triple to Joey Gallo but struck out John Hicks and induced a soft infield popout by Eli White before fanning David Dahl to end the threat.	The game took 1 hour, 48 minutes, the shortest game this season in the major leagues. Detroit and the Chicago White Sox played a doubleheader opener in 1:50 on April 29.	TWO-WAY RELATIONSHIP	The Blue Jays, who received approval Friday from the Canadian federal government to return home later this month, changed the paint scheme on the dugouts at their temporary home to read “Thank You Buffalo” and include the logo of the Buffalo Bisons, the Triple-A affiliate they displaced this season.	While attendance hadn't been announced for the doubleheader, it appeared that the twin bill drew the largest crowd of the Blue Jays' tenure at Sahlen Field. The Jays' previous largest home crowd of the season was 10,100 on Friday night.	ROSTER MOVES	Rangers: RHP Demarcus Evans was called up from Triple-A Round Rock as the 27th man for the doubleheader.	Blue Jays: IF Breyvic Valera, who was batting .313 in 41 games at Buffalo, was selected to the major league roster. OF Jonathan Davis was optioned to Buffalo, but was the 27th man for the twin bill. LHP Nick Allgeyer, who appeared in 11 games for Buffalo and one with Toronto, was designated for assignment.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Rangers: C Jose Trevino (right forearm contusion) is 3 for 7 in two games so far in his rehab assignment at Double-A Frisco. Rangers manager Chris Woodward said Trevino is healthy enough to be activated in the next week, but needs to continue work on his timing. ... C Sam Huff (right knee surgery) was activated from the 60-day injured list and optioned to Round Rock. To make room on the 40-man roster, RHP Tyler Phillips, who was with Round Rock, was designated for assignment.	UP NEXT	Rangers RHP Mike Foltynewicz (2-8, 5.11 ERA) takes on Blue Jays LHP Steven Matz (7-4, 4.72) in the second game of the doubleheader.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CINCINNATI -- — Back from the All-Star Game, Corbin Burnes looked more like an All-Star.	Burnes returned to form, pitching sharply into the ninth inning Sunday as the Milwaukee Brewers cruised to an 8-0 win and finished a three-game sweep of the Cincinnati Reds.	The NL Central-leading Brewers won four of the seven games against Cincinnati spanning the All-Star break.	“To get our lead in the division up to seven games is huge, knowing we've only got three more against them (this season),” Burnes said. “We’ve got to keep playing good baseball. We've got a couple off days here this week, so we can keep everyone fresh and keep everyone feeling good going into August.”	Burnes (5-4) dominated in his first outing since he was the losing pitcher for the National League in Tuesday's All-Star Game, when he went two innings and gave up two runs, including a 468-foot homer by Vladimir Guerrero Jr.	Burnes struck out 12 while allowing five hits and a walk in 8 1/3 innings Sunday, and finished with a 2.16 ERA. He didn’t allow a runner past first base until Cincinnati loaded the bases with one out in the ninth on two singles and an error.	Reliever Angel Perdomo came on to strike out Eugenio Suárez and Kyle Farmer to preserve the shutout.	“He wasn’t quite in sync the first inning, but innings two through eight — really two through nine — he was on cruise,” Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said. “Just every pitch executed, ahead in the count, just really, really good.”	Burnes had superb control of his cutter and with his pitch count in the 70s in the seventh inning, started thinking he could get a complete game. He's never had one in 29 starts over four seasons in the majors.	“It wasn't something on the front of my mind to go as long as I could today, but whenever I can do that, it always helps,” he said.	Christian Yelich hit a solo homer in the seventh and Willy Adames added a two-run shot in the ninth. Tyrone Taylor and Jackie Bradley Jr. each drove in two runs in a four-run fifth.	Sonny Gray (2-5), who has been on and off the injured list with strained muscles around his rib cage, got the start and did fine until the Brewers got busy in the fifth.	"In the fifth inning, I missed on a couple close pitches and it continued to spiral,” Gray said.	CRITICAL STRETCH	After the sweep by the Brewers, the Reds open a series with the NL East-leading New York Mets on Monday. After that comes seven games against teams that are right behind them in the division, the Cardinals and the Cubs. General manager Nick Krall said the Reds “absolutely” will be buyers at the July 31 deadline, but this stretch could determine how aggressive he’s willing to be.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: There was no update on RHP Brad Boxberger, who had to leave Saturday night's game with shoulder stiffness after pitching to one batter in the eighth.	Reds: All-Star right fielder Nick Castellanos missed a second game since getting hit by a pitch on the right wrist. Manager David Bell said he's not expected to be out much longer. ... Right-hander Michael Lorenzen will go on the injured list Monday with a right hamstring strain. He pitched a scoreless inning on Saturday night in his first action of the year after nursing a sore shoulder, but pulled up lame while scoring the tying run in the 10th inning. ...	UP NEXT	Brewers: After an off day, Eric Lauer (3-4, 3.83) will be on the mound in the opener of a two-game series with the Royals in Milwaukee on Tuesday. Left-hander Mike Minor (6-8, 5.67) is scheduled to start for Kansas City. Lauer threw six innings of one-run ball in a 2-0 loss to the Reds July 9. Minor was tagged for six runs and nine hits through four innings in a 14-6 loss to the Indians July 10.	Reds: The Mets come to town Monday for a three-game set, with right-hander Vladimir Gutierrez (4-3, 4.29) going for the Reds. Gutierrez had a good outing in a win over the Brewers in Milwaukee on July 10, allowing just a run on five hits through six innings. The Mets are shuffling their rotation given the latest injury — a tight forearm — to ace Jacob deGrom.	------	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP--Sports	------	Follow Mitch Stacy at http://twitter.com/mitchstacy	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

DETROIT -- — Jeimer Candelario homered, drove in three runs and started two double plays as the Detroit Tigers finished a weekend sweep of the Minnesota Twins with a 7-0 win on Sunday.	The game was the seventh in a row between the teams. Minnesota swept a four-game series at home immediately before the All-Star break before losing three in Detroit. The series was originally scheduled for four games, but Friday's doubleheader was rained out. The Tigers swept a doubleheader on Saturday.	“This is a weird game at times,” Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said. “They beat us up at their place, and then we come home and get a sweep. You don't usually see any team twice in a row like this, plus we're going right back there in a little over a week.”	Wily Peralta (3-1) pitched seven shutout innings for the second time in three starts, allowing four hits and four walks while striking out four. Peralta, who was aided by four double plays, is 3-1 with a 0.34 ERA in his last five starts.	“I'm a groundball pitcher, so having that kind of defense behind me is a great feeling,” said Peralta, who is in a major league rotation for the first time since 2017. “I didn't really have a good feel for the ball in the first couple innings, and they made some big plays.”	J.A. Happ (5-5) took the loss, giving up seven runs on 11 hits and a walk in seven innings. He struck out four and allowed two home runs.	With a doubleheader on Monday, Happ had to pitch deep into the game despite not having his best stuff.	“Unfortunately, this is the position we're in right now,” he said. “It doesn't happen as often these days, but we needed innings. I just couldn't get out of a couple bad innings.”	Jake Rogers led off the third with a double and moved up on Derek Hill's bunt single. Akil Baddoo struck out, but Jonathan Schoop gave the Tigers the lead with a sacrifice fly. After Robbie Grossman walked, Miguel Cabrera made it 2-0 with an RBI single and Candelario's double gave Detroit a three-run lead.	Baddoo and Hill both stole bases in the game as Hinch continues to manage an up-tempo style.	“It's fun out there right now,” said Hill, who has stolen six bases in 11 games with the Tigers. “We've got a lot of guys who can be aggressive on the bases and we are all executing right now.”	Schoop made it 5-0 with a two-run homer in the fifth, his 17th, and Candelario hit a two-run homer of his own in the seventh.	“(Happ) pitches very efficiently, so we thought we could get seven innings out of him even with the score a little worse than we would like,” Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. "He got the second out in the seventh, but Candelario hits one out and makes it a frustrating finish for him.	“We just didn't play well in this series. We've got an inexperienced group right now and we need to learn from this.”	TRAINER'S ROOM	Twins: C Mitch Garver (groin) will join the team on Monday in Chicago and is expected to be activated during a four-game series against the White Sox.	GETTING CLOSER TO 3,000	Cabrera's RBI single in the third was his 2,929th hit, tying him with Al Simmons for 40th in major league history. Cabrera got a bigger cheer from the crowd in the ninth inning when he lifted teammate Harold Castro into the air as the Tigers' scoreboard displayed “Simba Cam.”	UP NEXT	Twins: Minnesota plays the White Sox in a doubleheader on Monday. Griffin Jax (1-1, 8.66 ERA) and Jose Berrios (7-3, 3.48) are scheduled to start for the Twins.	Tigers: Detroit hosts the Texas Rangers for a four-game series starting on Monday. Casey Mize (5-5, 3.59) is scheduled to start for the Tigers in the opener against Kyle Gibson (6-1, 2.29).	------	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ATLANTA -- — Tampa Bay is making the most of its knack for comebacks to stay close in the AL East.	Yandy Diaz homered during a four-run rally in the seventh inning and the Rays beat the Atlanta Braves 7-5 on Sunday.	The Rays trailed 3-0 after four innings and 4-3 before completing their 28th come-from-behind win to win two of three in the series. It is the second-most comeback wins in the majors to the 29 by the AL East-leading Boston Red Sox with 29, the team Tampa Bay is chasing.	“There’s no quit in us,” said Kevin Kiermaier, whose double in the seventh tied the game at 4. “Just don’t ever count us out, no matter what, until that 27th out is made.”	Kiermaier said he'd like to see the Rays start stronger in games to boost their chances of catching Boston.	“We’d much rather get out to a quicker start but that’s just kind of how it’s been as of late,” Kiermaier said. “It takes a few more innings for us to get our momentum going.”	Kiermaier caught a long drive by Dansby Swanson before crashing into the center-field wall to end the fourth. He also stole a base.	The Braves (45-47) have not been above .500 this season but trail the first-place New York Mets by only four games in the NL East.	“I still feel like we’re capable of winning the division, honestly,” manager Brian Snitker said. “We’re in it till we’re out of it. ... I’m still waiting to get on a run.”	Joey Wendle singled and scored on Kiermaier's double off A.J. Minter (1-4) to tie it at 4 in the seventh. After Kiermaier stole third base, Austin Meadows' sacrifice fly to gave Tampa Bay the lead.	Diaz added to the lead with his two-run homer  off Luke Jackson.	“That’s two big wins we pulled out of here,” Rays manager Kevin Cash said. “We just collectively as a group came back.”	Wander Franco’s third homer in the sixth off Braves starter Drew Smyly made it 3-all.	Tampa Bay starter Rich Hill allowed three runs in four innings. Left-hander Jeffrey Springs (5-1) gave up one hit while recording two outs. Pete Fairbanks pitched the ninth for his fifth save, including two in the series.	Ozzie Albies doubled home Freddie Freeman in the first to put Atlanta ahead 1-0.	The Braves added two runs in the fourth. Guillermo Heredia hit an RBI double and following an infield hit by Smyly when Hill didn't cover first base, Joc Pederson's bases-loaded groundout drove in a run for a 3-0 lead.	Meadows' sacrifice fly drove in one run in Tampa Bay's two-run fifth. Brandon Lowe led off the inning with a single and scored from third on a wild pitch from Smyly.	Pederson, traded to Atlanta from the Chicago Cubs on Thursday, drove in two runs with two hits in his second start as the Braves' right fielder and leadoff hitter.	TRAINER’S ROOM	Cash said RHP Chris Archer (right forearm tightness) showed encouraging velocity in Saturday's minor league rehabilitation appearance for Triple-A Durham. Archer allowed two runs on three hits in 1 2/3 innings. He had two strikeouts. “He had a good fastball, good velocity ... and he showed a slider at times that was a Chris Archer slider.”	VOGT SHINES IN DEBUT	Veteran catcher Stephen Vogt, acquired by Atlanta from the Arizona Diamondbacks late Friday night for minor league first baseman Mason Berne, drove in a run and got three hits in his Braves debut. He also threw out Franco trying to steal second in the seventh.	BULLPEN GRIND	Atlanta's second blown lead of the series again left the spotlight on the bullpen. Minter gave up a run while walking two batters in Friday night's 7-6 loss in 10 innings. He allowed two runs on two hits while recording only one out on Sunday, leaving his ERA at 4.86.	“I look there’s big chunks he’s been really, really good, too,” Snitker said. “... It’s not just him. It’s tough and he’s going through the grind right now.”	UP NEXT	Rays: LHP Ryan Yarbrough (6-3, 4.30) will try to extend his streak of 12 appearances, including nine starts, without a loss when the Rays open a home series against the Baltimore Orioles on Monday night. Yarbrough's last loss came on April 30 against Houston.	Braves: Rookie LHP Kyle Muller (1-2, 3.45) is expected to be recalled from Triple-A Gwinnett to start when Atlanta opens a three-game series against Yu Darvish (7-3, 3.09) and the San Diego Padres on Monday night.	------	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.
