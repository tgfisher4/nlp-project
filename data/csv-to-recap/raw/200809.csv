DETROIT -- Sean Gallagher wasn't sure what to expect in his first start after coming off the disabled list.	He ended up with one of the odder pitching lines of his short career.	Gallagher walked six in four hitless innings, Ryan Sweeney and Jack Cust hit back-to-back homers in the first and the Oakland Athletics beat the Detroit Tigers 5-2 on Wednesday.	Gallagher, who had been out since Aug. 20 with shoulder fatigue, struck out six and threw 44 of his 88 pitches for strikes.	"It was a little different out there with all those walks and strikeouts and no hits," he said. "I felt good and my arm didn't bother me at all. I missed the plate on a few pitches, but I was able to come back and make quality pitches to get outs."	Gallagher walked the bases loaded in the first and fourth but got out of both jams. The rookie right-hander struck out Jeff Larish to end the first and got Brandon Inge to fly out to end the fourth.	"He pitched pretty well, but he had to battle his command as you can see from the strange strikeout and walk totals," Oakland manager Bob Geren said. "He was able to make his pitches when he needed them -- he's going to be one of the good young pitchers in this league."	Fellow rookie starter Armando Galarraga (12-6) didn't fare quite as well for Detroit. He allowed five runs and eight hits in four innings, extending his winless stretch to four starts.	"He looks like he's starting to burn out a little bit," Tigers manager Jim Leyland said. "We'll see how it plays out -- he's going to get an extra day before his next start, but he might be running on empty."	Galarraga retired the first two batters before Sweeney and Cust went deep to start the A's toward their fourth win in five games.	"It's always good to get ahead early, and when you get homers, it feels even better," Sweeney said. "Gallagher gave us four good innings, we added some more runs and the bullpen kept us ahead. That's a positive win."	Oakland scored three runs in the fourth to take a 5-0 lead. Eric Patterson had an RBI single and Aaron Cunningham drove in a pair with a two-out base hit.	Huston Street (6-5) worked a scoreless seventh to get the win and Brad Ziegler pitched the ninth for his eighth save in eight tries.	"Getting the two homers in the first in a big ballpark was huge for us," said Geren, who used six relievers. "We got some key hits when we needed them and then the pen held them down."	Miguel Cabrera led off the sixth with a single for Detroit's first hit and scored on Ryan Raburn's two-out, two-run single. Alan Embree entered with two runners on and got Curtis Granderson to fly out to end the inning.	The Tigers got a runner on in the ninth against Ziegler, but Granderson was easily doubled off first to end the game after Magglio Ordonez's flyout to deep center.	"I thought the ball was way over the center fielder's head, but it is still a dumb mistake on my part," Granderson said. "My run didn't even mean anything, since we were down three, so I had no business doing that."	Game notes	 Granderson was the second Tigers player to be doubled off during the game. Oakland third baseman Jeff Baisley made a diving stop of Marcus Thames' liner with the bases loaded in the sixth and then threw to first in time to retire Mike Hessman. ... The teams combined to use 12 pitchers, who struck out 22 and walked 11.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

MILWAUKEE -- Mike Cameron sure hopes his clutch hit carries over to the sputtering Milwaukee Brewers' biggest road trip of the season.	"I tell you what, it was a good spark today leaving up out of here," Cameron said. "We got the fuse lit."	Cameron singled in the go-ahead run in the eighth inning Wednesday, and Milwaukee rallied to beat the Cincinnati Reds 4-3, avoiding a three-game sweep.	The NL wild card-leading Brewers, who have won just three of their last 10 games, looked destined for another loss against Cincinnati. They trailed 3-1 after six but their meager offense, which scored 28 runs in the 10-game homestand, did just enough.	"Yeah, there's a sigh of relief, and a change of scenery does people good, too," Brewers manager Ned Yost said. "We've been here 10 days, as much we like playing here, it's been a struggle. Now we'll go elsewhere and see if we can't get on a big roll."	Elsewhere is Philadelphia, where the Brewers will start a 10-game, 11-day trip Thursday night with four games against the Phillies, followed by three games against the Cubs.	"Some guys are playing for pennies, and some guys are playing for gold right now," Cameron said.	Milwaukee entered with a three-game lead over Philadelphia in the wild-card race with St. Louis and Houston close behind. The Brewers also were 4½ back of NL Central-leading Chicago. All four teams play later Wednesday, including the Cubs at St. Louis.	"This is horribly fun, if you can understand what I am saying. It's a lot, a lot of fun, but it's a grind and there's a lot of pressure that goes with it," Yost said. "We know what we're doing. We know what we're up against."	Cameron, one of the veterans brought in for exactly this reason after Milwaukee coughed up an 8½-game lead last summer, was at the center of the important rally. He drew a leadoff walk in the seventh, moved up on a groundout and scored on shortstop Jeff Keppinger's throwing error off Jason Kendall's infield single.	Reds starter Bronson Arroyo outpitched CC Sabathia and handed a 3-2 lead over to David Weathers (2-6), who couldn't hold on to the advantage.	"[It] would have been nice to bury him," Arroyo said of hanging Sabathia with his first NL loss. "But that is the way the game goes, keep it close and they made it happen in the eighth."	Milwaukee loaded the bases with no outs before Tony Gwynn Jr. hit into a double play that scored J.J. Hardy for the tying run. Cameron then singled in Ryan Braun to make it 4-3.	"When Cameron got that hit, I couldn't hear the rest of the players screaming because I was screaming," Yost said.	Cameron didn't hear anything, either.	"I was screaming myself," he said.	Guillermo Mota (5-5) tossed a perfect eighth to get the win and Salomon Torres struck out the side in the ninth for his 27th save in 34 opportunities.	Sabathia, who remains 9-0 in 13 starts, struck out eight and allowed eight hits in seven innings. He also drove an unearned run with a groundout in the third and added a double in the fifth.	Sabathia won't pitch against the Phillies, but will go in the opener against the Cubs on Tuesday.	"I was thinking about that today, we're going into that big series and not being able to pitch," Sabathia said. "But I do get to pitch in Chicago, which is going to be another big series. It's a big road trip."	Jerry Hairston Jr., activated from the DL on Tuesday, hit a three-run homer off the big left-hander to give Cincinnati a 3-1 lead, but the Reds' errors cost them a chance to sweep the Brewers in Miller Park for the first time in five years.	"The unearned runs, those are two runs you gave away, you can't give away runs," manager Dusty Baker said. "That was the difference in the game."	Hairston's fifth-inning homer appeared to be enough for Arroyo, who got out of a bases-loaded jam in the bottom half by getting J.J. Hardy to hit a hard grounder that third baseman Edwin Encarnacion turned into a nifty double play.	But Cameron delivered with the heart of the Brewers' order -- Ryan Braun, Prince Fielder and Corey Hart -- hitting a combined .208 (22-of-106) with no homers and six RBIs in the homestand.	"It's always good when you can get a big hit, especially where we've been the last few days, the highs and lows," Cameron said. "Everybody's been trying to maintain their composure, and just keep playing, keep grinding and try to compete. That's all you can do."	Game notes	 Brewers RF Gabe Kapler left with a strained right shoulder after making a hard throw to the plate in the sixth. ... Yost gave Hart the day off, saying he didn't remember the last time his All-Star right fielder got a hit. ... Milwaukee claimed RHP Todd Coffey off waivers from Cincinnati. The reliever left town immediately after being designated for assignment Tuesday and will join the Brewers in Philadelphia. ... The Reds' three-game winning streak was snapped.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Torii Hunter put on goggles, got on the clubhouse floor and began doing the butterfly and backstroke in a puddle of beer and champagne.	Hunter and the Los Angeles Angels had plenty to celebrate Wednesday.	They became the first team in the majors to clinch a playoff spot this season by winning their fourth AL West title in five years.	"I love it. I'm Michael Phelps," Hunter bellowed, invoking the Olympic swimmer who won eight gold medals in Beijing. "This is what it's all about."	Francisco Rodriguez earned his 56th save in closing out the Angels' 4-2 victory over the New York Yankees. Second-place Texas lost to Seattle 8-7 about an hour later, clinching the division for Los Angeles.	That set off mini-parties as the players emerged from the clubhouse to share their jubilation with several hundred fans who remained to cheer the final out in Seattle.	Hunter, who joined the Angels from Minnesota as a free agent during the offseason, began serving a two-day suspension Wednesday, so he wasn't allowed on the field or in the dugout. Pitcher Justin Speier wore Hunter's jersey on the field in his honor.	Stadium scoreboards flashed "2008 AL West champions" and fans held up their own signs, including one that read "I want to go to the World Series."	"It doesn't get old," longtime Angels star Garret Anderson said.	Team owner Arte Moreno came on the field, clapping his hands and repeatedly signaling thumbs-up to the red-clad fans. They responded with chants of "Arte! Arte!"	"Right now I'm more interested in how we finish up the season and get prepared to play in the playoffs," he said. "Obviously, you always like to have home-field advantage."	Pitcher Jered Weaver was the most exuberant, waving his cap and pumping his arms. A teammate poured beer into his mouth.	A couple players grabbed the hose behind the pitcher's mound and turned it on, spraying their teammates and fans gathered behind the Angels' dugout.	The Angels, with the best record in baseball, can now spend their final 17 games resting and setting up their rotation for the playoffs.	"There's no such thing as too soon to clinch," Hunter said. "We've been going hard to get to this point. It doesn't matter if we clinch early or late, as long as we clinched."	Los Angeles wrapped up the division without starters Chone Figgins (injured), Mark Teixeira (ill) and Hunter, who was suspended for helping trigger a bench-clearing scuffle with Yankees catcher Ivan Rodriguez on Monday.	The Angels will try to do something that none of their previous division-winning teams accomplished -- reach the World Series. They won their first and only World Series title as a wild-card team in 2002, the year they knocked Hunter's Minnesota Twins out of the playoffs.	Perhaps there might even be the first Freeway Series this year -- the Dodgers lead the NL West.	Like Hunter, Teixeira was thrilled to come to the Angels after years of playing with the Rangers in the same division.	"I've always been jealous of the Angels," he said. "Some great players play their entire careers without ever getting a taste of the postseason, and I'm going to have that opportunity this year."	Inside the clubhouse, manager Mike Scioscia grinned when pitcher Ervin Santana delighted in dumping more booze on his head. A couple players returned to the dugout, alternately spraying champagne on fans and chugging from the bottle.	"You can't minimize how important this is," Scioscia said. "It happened a little earlier than it has in other seasons, but it's not easy getting to that first step, so we're excited about going to the playoffs and we're going to keep going."	Robb Quinlan hit a go-ahead, two-run single in the fifth inning for the Angels.	Rodriguez pitched a scoreless ninth and moved within one save of Bobby Thigpen's 18-year-old major-league record. He threw a called third strike past Hideki Matsui with runners at first and third for the final out.	Dustin Moseley (2-4) allowed two runs and three hits in five innings while making a spot start for Weaver, whose injured fingers pushed him back to Thursday. Moseley struck out six and walked three in winning for the first time since April 9 against Cleveland.	Andy Pettitte (13-13) lost for the sixth time in his last nine starts. The left-hander gave up four runs and nine hits in 4 2/3 innings, tying his second-shortest outing of the season.	"It's a bad feeling, especially when you work so hard to prepare yourself for the season and really prepare yourself for October," he said. "Obviously, people think we're out of the playoffs and guys think they're out of the playoffs, but I'd hope they would play for some pride."	The Yankees finished 5-5 on their four-city trip, making it likely they'll miss the playoffs for the first time in 13 years. They head to New York for their final 10 games at Yankee Stadium.	"We started off the trip so well and we didn't finish very well. That's the frustrating part," manager Joe Girardi said. "You have pride in what you do, and there's no X by our name [in the standings], so there's still a lot to play for. I still think out guys believe we have something to play for."	Leading 2-1, Pettitte nearly got out of a bases-loaded jam in the fifth. After giving up consecutive singles to Gary Matthews Jr., Anderson and Vladimir Guerrero, he retired Juan Rivera and Kendry Morales on called third strikes.	Facing a full count, Quinlan lined a single to left, scoring two runs. Guerrero continued home on Xavier Nady's throw that sailed over the head of third baseman Alex Rodriguez and into the netting for an error, allowing the Angels to take a 4-2 lead.	"He worked the count on me and fouled off tough pitches that I felt I had a chance to get him with," Pettitte said. "I didn't want to walk him, and I just kind of tugged it a little bit more over the middle of the plate than I wanted to and gave up a hit to him."	New York scored both of its runs in the first on Jason Giambi's RBI single and a balk by Moseley that allowed Bobby Abreu to score from third.	The Angels scored their first run on Rivera's RBI groundout in the first.	Game notes	 First baseman Teixeira sat out because of an infection and a temperature. Figgins was not in the starting lineup for the second straight game because of a sore right elbow. He got hit by a pitch during Monday's game and Scioscia said Figgins was having difficulty throwing and swinging the bat. ... Weaver (10-10) was announced as Thursday's starter against Seattle, with cuts on the right middle and ring fingers of his pitching hand having healed. "I'll throw everything," he said. "It just depends on how sharp everything is." ... The Angels reached 3 million in attendance, making them and the Yankees the only teams to do so in each of the last six seasons.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Two weeks ago the Arizona Diamondbacks seemed a lock to make it to the postseason. Now just finishing the year with a .500 record may be a struggle.	One day after losing to San Francisco in the ninth inning, the Diamondbacks let another game slip away in the final at-bat when Eugenio Velez hit a two-out, two-run triple off Arizona's Brandon Lyon to lift the Giants to a 4-3 win on Wednesday.	It was the second straight walkoff hit for Velez and completed San Francisco's three-game sweep. It also sent the slumping Diamondbacks to their sixth straight loss overall and 10th consecutive on the road to fall three games behind the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West. Los Angeles plays at San Diego later Wednesday.	"That's the way it's going right now but it's to the point where sulking and getting down and pressing ... it's time to put an end to that stuff," Arizona catcher Chris Snyder said. "It's time to just go all out, play your hardest, lay your chips on the table and see what happens."	Not much has gone right for the Diamondbacks lately.	Arizona held a 4½ game lead over the Dodgers on Aug. 29 but has lost nine of 11 since then to fall to a season-high three games below .500 at 71-74. With at least five teams ahead of them in the chase for the wild card spot, the Diamondbacks' hopes of making the playoffs are fading fast.	They finished their road trip 0-6 and haven't won on the road since beating Houston 11-5 on Aug. 16. Arizona plays 10 of its final 17 games at Chase Field but has a final seven-game trip to Colorado and St. Louis later this month.	"It's just weird how things are going but at the same time we can't give up on ourselves," said center fielder Chris Young, whose two-run triple off San Francisco closer Brian Wilson in the top of the ninth gave Arizona a brief 3-2 lead. "It was a horrible road trip, no question about that. But we aren't going to give up. No matter what people expect we're going to still go out there and fight every day. That's all we can do."	The Diamondbacks might have fared better were it not for Velez. The Giants' infielder drove in the game-winning run in the ninth inning of Tuesday's 5-4 win over Arizona and knocked in San Francisco's first two runs off Diamondbacks starter Dan Haren on Wednesday.	Velez was down 0-2 to Lyon (2-5) when he drilled a fastball to the gap in right-center, scoring pinch-runner Ryan Rohlinger and Aaron Rowand as the afternoon crowd at AT&T Park roared.	"In that situation always I'm looking for a fastball," Velez said. "I'm a fastball hitter so I don't want to swing at something soft and hit a groundball or something like that. If I get a fastball in that situation with two strikes, I have to swing. I was waiting for it."	The Giants matched their season-high win streak of five straight.	Alex Hinshaw (2-1) got one out for the win after Wilson blew his fifth save of the year. Wilson, second in the NL with 37 saves, stood to take the loss before his teammates rallied off Lyon.	Bengie Molina started the comeback with a one-out single. Rohlinger entered to pinch run and moved to second when Rowand walked with two outs before Velez came through with his second straight game-winning hit.	"Same guy, same hero," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "He's a battler, I'll say that. He's still in the learning stage about the game ... but he's got great tools. He's done the things you want to see."	Young's two-run triple off Wilson prevented San Francisco starter Brad Hennessey from claiming his first win in more than two years but wasn't enough to keep San Francisco from sweeping the Diamondbacks at AT&T Park for the first time since April 20-22, 2007.	Hennessey, who was taking Kevin Correia's turn in the Giants' rotation, made his first start since Sept. 15, 2006. The righty spent the better part of two years in the bullpen but pitched well in a series of starts in the minors, convincing Bochy to use him against the Diamondbacks.	The plan worked better than expected until Arizona rallied against Wilson.	Hennessey pitched six strong innings, giving up four hits including a solo home run to Stephen Drew in the third, and pitched out of jams in the first and fourth. He retired nine of the final 11 batters he faced before giving way to reliever Jack Taschner to start the seventh.	That seemed to be enough against Arizona, which hadn't shown much life the past two weeks while tumbling out of first place in the NL West.	"We just couldn't finish it off," Diamondbacks manager Bob Melvin said. "It's the same as we were yesterday. We've just got to find a way to win some games, get one under our belt and hopefully roll off of that."	Drew homered off Hennessey in the third but the Diamondbacks couldn't get much else off the Giants' starter, who left with a 2-1 lead after Velez's bases-loaded double in the third.	Haren lasted only four innings to run his winless streak to four straight starts.	Game notes	 After the game the Giants announced that OF Fred Lewis will undergo season-ending foot surgery on Friday. Lewis, who started in left field and went 2-for-5 against Arizona on Wednesday, has been nursing a painful bunion on his right foot most of the year.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

PHILADELPHIA -- Brett Myers believes the Phillies are pressing. Charlie Manuel wants his team to start having fun again.	Whatever ails the Phillies, they need to fix it fast if they want to return the playoffs for the second straight season.	Ricky Nolasco struck out eight in 7 2/3 innings and Luis Gonzalez homered to help the Florida Marlins hinder Philadelphia's playoff push in a 7-3 win over the Phillies on Wednesday.	"We're just pressing so hard to make up ground in one game," said Myers, who took the loss.	Philadelphia fell three games behind the NL East-leading New York Mets, who played later Wednesday night.	The Phillies also dropped four games behind Milwaukee in the wild-card race. The Phillies hopes for a postseason return could get a boost -- or be thwarted -- when they open a four-game series with the Brewers on Thursday at Citizens Bank Park.	"It's going to be an exciting four games here, but we've got to start winning some games," Utley said.	At this point last season, the Phillies were six games behind the Mets and ended up winning the division on the final day. But there's a crucial difference between the NL East champions and this year's team.	"I think the difference is, last year we were hot," Manuel said. "We had enough pitching to get through. We were energetic. We had life. We really got after it."	There was little fun for the Phillies on Wednesday.	Reliever J.C. Romero and catcher Chris Coste appeared aggravated with each other on the mound after the lefty allowed a two-run double in the ninth. Jimmy Rollins shot a look at center fielder Shane Victorino after a lazy throw into the second base on the same play.	"We let it get away from us there at the end," Manuel said.	Josh Willingham snapped a 3-all tie with an RBI double in the eighth inning and helped the Marlins win the three-game series. Dan Uggla added a two-run double off Romero in the ninth.	"Nobody's giving up," said Nolasco. "We're not just coming in here and finishing out the season.	Nolasco (14-7) struck out Howard, Pat Burrell and Victorino in the fourth, and even had an RBI single. He hasn't allowed more than three runs in any of his last nine starts and is 4-1 over that span.	Ryan Howard hit his major league-leading 42nd homer for the Phillies. The Phillies didn't have a hit after the fifth inning.	"It's fun coming in here in September knowing you still have a mathematical chance," said Marlins manager Fredi Gonzalez.	Myers (9-11) had another solid outing -- nine strikeouts, four runs in 7 1/3 innings -- but lost for only the second time in 10 starts since he was recalled from the minor leagues on July 20.	Myers went from opening day ace to the minor leagues and back to arguably their second-half MVP as the defending NL East champs make another late-season playoff push. He retired 10 straight until Gonzalez touched him with a leadoff single in the eighth and the game tied at 3.	After another single put runners on the corners, Manuel saw enough of his tiring right-hander.	Willingham ripped a ground-rule double down the third-base line for a 4-3 lead. The ball was touched by a fan, likely preventing pinch-runner Robert Andino from scoring. After an intentional walk, Chad Durbin retired Paul Lo Duca on a double play to end the inning.	Myers said he'll take the ball Sunday on three days' rest against the Brewers, if needed.	"We were a little more relaxed last year," said Myers, who was their closer last year.	Nolasco struck out the side in the fourth and was staked to a 3-1 lead when he ran into trouble. Coste had an RBI double to center that made it 3-2. Coste, though, was stuck on third after a sacrifice bunt and Rollins popped up. Jayson Werth poked an RBI single to left that tied the score.	Myers gave the bullpen a breather a day after six pitchers combined to go 7 1/3 innings in a 10-8 loss. He started strong, striking out four of five batters he faced in one span, then allowed a two-run shot to Gonzalez in the third. Gonzalez's eighth homer of the year gave the Marlins a 2-1 lead.	Myers allowed Dallas McPherson's leadoff double in the fourth and the Marlins third baseman scored on Nolasco's RBI single to left for a 3-1 lead.	Howard put the Phillies ahead 1-0 in the second when his 42nd homer of the season smacked off the scoreboard in right.	Game notes	 The Phillies will start LHP Jamie Moyer (13-7, 3.64 ERA) on three days rest against Milwaukee on Thursday. Moyer pitched seven scoreless innings Sunday against the Mets in the first game of a doubleheader. ... The Phillies activated OF Geoff Jenkins from the 15-day disabled list. Jenkins was out for 2 1/2 weeks with a strained right hip flexor. ... Phillies INF Andy Tracy is out for the rest of the season with a broken hand. Tracy, a utility infielder with only two at-bats this season, was hit on the left hand by a line drive during batting practice.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

SEATTLE -- Ichiro Suzuki is hoping to reach at least one of his goals during the Seattle Mariners' lost season.	Suzuki and Raul Ibanez had four hits apiece to help Seattle beat the Texas Rangers 8-7 on Wednesday, handing the AL West title to the Los Angeles Angels.	Ibanez also had three RBIs and Suzuki moved within 10 of an eighth straight season with at least 200 hits. That would tie Wee Willie Keeler for the most 200-hit seasons to start a career.	"It's always been a clear goal for me," Suzuki said. "So there is not a reason that I wouldn't be motivated."	The second-place Rangers' loss coupled with the Angels' 4-2 win over the New York Yankees clinched the division for Los Angeles, which became the first team in the majors to wrap up a spot in the postseason.	"To be able to clinch with two weeks left in the season shows you they have been playing great baseball all year long," Texas shortstop Michael Young said. "They deserve it for sure."	The Mariners felt some relief with Los Angeles wrapping it up. They play their next four games in Anaheim so they avoid having the Angels celebrate in front of them as they did last season.	"You want to be the team celebrating but not the team they're celebrating on," Ibanez said. "They play an aggressive style of baseball. It's fun to watch on TV but not fun to play against. I have a lot of respect for that club and what they've done."	Roy Corcoran (5-0), the fifth of seven relievers used by the Mariners, worked 1 2/3 scoreless innings to get the win and J.J. Putz earned his 13th save in 21 opportunities.	Nelson Cruz, Taylor Teagarden and Hank Blalock each hit a two-run homer for Texas, which couldn't overcome a rough outing from Kevin Millwood (9-9). Chris Davis added a solo drive in the eighth.	Ibanez hit a tiebreaking RBI single off Kameron Loe in the sixth to make it 7-6 and added another run-scoring single with two outs in the seventh.	It was another nice day in a terrific second half for Ibanez, who is batting .310 with 23 homers and 105 RBIs on the year.	"I'm just glad I don't have to face him," Putz said. "Raul has been as hot as anybody in the game right now. It's really nothing new. He's been as consistent as anybody the past three or four years. It's been a pleasure to call him a teammate and watch what he has been doing."	Suzuki got the Mariners off to a fast start. He led off the first with an infield single, stole second on the next pitch and raced to third when catcher Teagarden's throw went into center field.	Yuniesky Betancourt then hit a grounder to shortstop, giving the Mariners a 1-0 lead.	Kenji Johjima hit a two-run single in the second, and Ibanez doubled in Betancourt in the third.	Cesar Jimenez worked three scoreless innings in his first major-league start for Seattle, which used a committee approach with its starting pitchers ailing. Cruz and Teagarden connected against Jared Wells in the fifth to tie it at 4.	The Mariners' first three hitters, Suzuki, Betancourt and Ibanez, went 10-for-14, scored five runs and drove in four.	Millwood allowed seven runs, five earned, and 11 hits in five-plus innings.	"I just wasn't good," he said. "I thought I made some good pitches; I just didn't make enough of them."	Game notes	 Mariners third baseman Adrian Beltre flew to Los Angeles to see a hand specialist about his injured left thumb. "He was really sore [Tuesday] so I know he'll shut him down a couple days, probably," manager Jim Riggleman said. "He'll talk with the doctor and decide what needs to be done at this time or later." There is concern that Beltre will need surgery, which would end his season. ... Texas' Milton Bradley, who came out of Tuesday's game with back pain, sat out Wednesday. Texas manager Ron Washington said it is not a serious issue and expects him to be ready for the four-game Oakland series beginning Thursday. ... Ranger catcher/DH Gerald Laird batted leadoff Wednesday for the first time in his career. He was 0-2 with a pair of walks.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ATLANTA -- James Parr has no complaints after his first two major league starts.	Well, except being denied his second win.	Parr pitched six scoreless innings for the second straight start, but the shaky Atlanta bullpen blew a 4-0 lead. Fortunately for the Braves, Kelly Johnson and Chipper Jones hit back-to-back homers that sparked them to a 9-5 victory over Colorado on Wednesday night, dealing another blow to the Rockies' fading playoff hopes.	"Honestly, at first, I wanted the win," said Parr, who allowed five hits, struck out five and didn't walk anyone. "But this is about the team. I want the team to win. I've got to go out there and keep us in the game so we can take some momentum into next year."	The streaking Johnson homered twice for the Braves, who won it with a five-run seventh after the Rockies scored four in the top half to tie the game.	"It feels good," Johnson said after extending his hitting streak to nine games with his first homer since July 27. "It's one of those stretches you go through. I just hope to keep it going."	Parr is on quite a roll. The 22-year-old right-hander allowed only one run in his last 17 innings at Triple-A Richmond, and he's yet to be scored on since coming up to Atlanta.	He become the first Brave since Kyle Davies in 2005 to pitch 12 scoreless innings at the start of his career, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. And he's the first Atlanta hurler since Larry McWilliams in July 1978 to go at least six scoreless innings in each of his first two big-league starts.	"This is pretty awesome," Parr said. "I couldn't ask for a better beginning."	He's also getting a head start on spring training, when the Braves are likely to be looking for one or two young pitchers to round out their rotation.	"I just like him because he throws his fastball, he works fast and he comes right at you," Jones said. "We like pitchers like that."	Johnson, who homered in the first, led off the bottom half of the seventh with a towering drive just inside the right-field foul pole against Luis Vizcaino (1-1). Jones followed with the 407th homer of his career, and Vizcaino was yanked without getting an out after Brian McCann doubled.	Atlanta poured it on against Steven Register. Brandon Jones had an RBI double and Josh Anderson singled up the middle to bring home two more runs. The Braves sent 10 batters to the plate.	"When you don't make good pitches, you have to pay," Vizcaino said. "I made bad pitches."	Jeff Bennett (3-6) got the win by pitching two-thirds of an inning.	Atlanta took its second straight from the Rockies, only the fourth time since the All-Star break the Braves have put together consecutive wins.	The Rockies, who hoped to pull off the sort of September charge that propelled them all the way to the World Series last season, appear done after their fought straight loss. They began the day seven games behind the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, and have only 16 games remaining.	"Our window of opportunity is pretty small now," manager Clint Hurdle said. "We need to win ballgames."	Johnson, the second batter of the game for Atlanta, homered off Livan Hernandez. Yunel Escobar added a run-scoring double in the fourth, and the Braves knocked out Hernandez with two runs in the fifth.	Parr escaped a couple of jams, one with a big assist from center fielder Anderson. Troy Tulowitzki led off the third with a double, and Hernandez moved him to third with a sacrifice bunt. Parr fanned Dexter Fowler, then gave up a long drive to Jeff Baker.	Anderson raced to the wall in left-center and stretched his glove to the yellow line, making the catch as he crashed into the wall. He tumbled onto the warning track, but quickly bounced up and showed the umpires that he, indeed, had the ball.	Parr pumped his fist as the out call was made, and waited outside the dugout to high-five Anderson.	But the Braves' bullpen couldn't hold the lead.	Blaine Boyer took over in the seventh and gave up a homer to Ian Stewart on his third pitch. A walk and a single sent Boyer packing without getting an out. Will Ohman took over and gave up Fowler's first big league hit. Jeff Bennett gave up a two-run single to Jeff Baker, and Brad Hawpe tied the game at 4 with a sacrifice fly.	Game notes	 Johnson had the fourth multihomer game of his career. ... Jones' homer tied him with Duke Snider for 42nd on the career list. "That just means I'm getting old," Jones quipped. ... Fowler grew up in suburban Atlanta.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

BALTIMORE -- Through all the countless hours he spent rehabilitating an assortment of injuries, Scott Lewis never abandoned hope of pitching in the major leagues.	The sacrifices he made over the past five years paid off Wednesday night, when Lewis allowed three hits over eight shutout innings in his major league debut to help the Cleveland Indians beat the Baltimore Orioles 7-1.	Lewis (1-0) struck out three, walked none and retired the final eight batters he faced in a 96-pitch performance -- 67 of which were strikes. He came three outs short of becoming the first Cleveland pitcher since Luis Tiant in 1964 to throw a shutout in his major league debut.	Being pulled with a 7-0 lead didn't bother him one bit.	"I can't be disappointed about anything today," he said. "I only pitched eight innings once before and that was a complete game loss."	Cleveland manager Eric Wedge said, "We thought about taking him out after seven, but he coasted through the seventh effortlessly. We wanted to keep him under 100 pitches."	Lewis underwent elbow ligament replacement surgery while at Ohio State in 2003 before being drafted in the third round by Cleveland in 2004. He was limited to six starts in 2005 because of biceps tendinitis, then spent most of the 2006 season on a limited pitch count before finally pitching a full season last year with Double-A Akron.	This spring training, however, Lewis strained a back muscle and was forced to stay in extended spring training until early June. He combined to go 8-4 with a 2.53 ERA for Akron and Triple-A Buffalo before finally making his way to the Indians.	The wait was well worth it.	"I always stayed positive. You can't get caught up in whether you are going to be hurt all of your career," he said. "I always had a vision in the back of my head and it came true. It was better than I had hoped. ... I never expected to do this well. I had hoped to get deep into the game and maybe only give up a few [runs]. I stayed pretty calm."	In his last minor league appearance, one week earlier, Lewis gave up three runs in 5 2/3 innings against Bowie, Baltimore's Double-A farm team.	He fared even better against the Orioles, allowing one runner past second base in becoming the first Cleveland pitcher to win in his debut since Fausto Carmona in 2006.	"I've never seen hitters look that bad against a young guy coming from Double-A," said Alex Cintron, who had one of the three hits against Lewis. "We were fouling a lot of pitches and we missed a lot. I was kind of surprised."	Masahide Kobayashi gave up three hits, including an RBI double to Aubrey Huff, in the ninth. Baltimore has lost 10 of 11, and has been outscored 89-31 in the losses.	Kelly Shoppach hit two solo homers and scored three runs for the Indians, who came in with a season-high six-game homerless drought. It was the catcher's third multihomer game of the season, and that was only half his contribution to the victory.	"I have two jobs to do: Take care of him and to hit, too," Shoppach said, referring to Lewis. "I am very happy for him to go out and handle the nerves the way he did."	The Indians helped Lewis with plenty of run support. Cleveland got a first-inning run off Chris Waters (2-3) on a sacrifice fly by Jhonny Peralta, then went up 4-0 in the fourth. With the bases loaded, Asdrubal Cabrera hit a two-run double and Grady Sizemore followed with a sacrifice fly.	Shoppach homered off Waters in the fifth, then connected off Randor Bierd in the seventh. Cabrera added a sacrifice fly in the seventh.	Game notes	 The Indians tied an AL record when Gutierrez was hit by a pitch in the fourth inning. It was the 92nd HBP for Cleveland, tying the mark set by Toronto in 1996. ... Baltimore has lost 15 of 17. ... Shoppach has seven homers in his last 17 games. ... Sizemore went 0-for-4 and is in an 0-for-19 skid.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

BOSTON -- Jason Hammel thought he'd do a little throwing in the bullpen to stay loose. He wound up being thrown into the tightest spot he could imagine.	Carlos Pena hit a three-run homer in the 14th inning, then Hammel escaped a major jam Wednesday night to give the AL East-leading Tampa Bay Rays a 4-2 win over the Boston Red Sox.	After playing more than five hours, the Rays increased their division edge to 2 1/2 games over the Red Sox. Boston's wild-card lead was cut to five games by Minnesota.	"I figured I'd just get some work in," said Hammel, who entered when closer Troy Percival left after his back tightened up. "I hadn't pitched in five days. I wanted to get up and keep the arm fresh. I figured Perc would close it out."	After Pena's homer, Boston loaded the bases with no outs in the 14th against Percival. Hammel took over with a 4-1 lead and retired three straight batters for his first save since he pitched at Class A Hudson Valley in 2002.	"You've got to give Jason Hammel a lot of credit -- my God," Tampa Bay manager Joe Maddon said. "Coming in with the bases loaded at that point of the batting order ... that was a truly tremendous performance."	Kevin Youkilis' sacrifice fly made it 4-2 before Jason Bay struck out and Alex Cora flied out.	"The adrenaline was obviously more than I've ever felt," said Hammel, still showing the effect from a celebratory shaving cream pie to the face.	Percival, who said warming up a few times likely led to his back trouble, was excited by Hammel's performance.	"When I'm the weakest link in the bullpen, its a pretty good bullpen," Percival said. "I'll get some treatment tomorrow and it'll be OK. It's nothing."	Tampa Bay was only 1-for-35 with runners in scoring position in this series before Pena homered.	The Rays, who led the division by 5 1/2 games last week, won the final two matchups at Fenway Park. Tampa Bay had its lead sliced to one-half game with its 3-0 loss to Boston on Monday.	"This team is obviously energized because of the way we won it," Pena said. "It's been exciting both days."	The teams meet again next week for three games at Tropicana Field, where the Rays are 6-0 against the Red Sox.	Tampa Bay had managed only one hit with runners in scoring position during this set -- Dioner Navarro delivered a go-ahead double against Jonathan Papelbon in the ninth inning of Tuesday's 5-4 comeback win -- before Pena hit Mike Timlin's pitch into the Green Monster seats.	"We didn't want Pena to hit in that inning because of what he can do," Boston manager Terry Francona said. "He didn't miss with that pitch. That was off the plate."	Timlin (4-4) tied Kent Tekulve for the most appearances by a right-handed reliever with 1,050. Akinori Iwamura and Rocco Baldelli singled with two outs before Pena hit his 28th homer.	"I was extremely surprised," Timlin said. "It was a good pitch. We pushed him off the plate and then went down and away."	Trevor Miller (2-0) pitched one hitless inning.	The Red Sox had runners on first and second in the ninth, 10th, 11th and 12th, but did not scored.	Josh Beckett, making his second start after being sidelined for nearly three weeks with an inflamed right elbow, gave up one run and six hits in six innings.	In the 12th, Dustin Pedroia was hit by a pitch leading off and David Ortiz, trying to bunt for a hit against an overshifted infield, wound up with his first sacrifice since 2001.	Chad Bradford got Youkilis on a double-play grounder and Bay bounced to short in the 10th. Jacoby Ellsbury, hitless in six at-bats before a 14th inning double, flied out to end the 11th. He also ended the ninth, grounding out.	Rays starter Andy Sonnanstine allowed one unearned run, fanned seven and didn't walk anyone in seven innings.	Willy Aybar's RBI triple over the head of right fielder Mark Kotsay moved the Rays ahead 1-0 in the second after Cliff Floyd reached on bad-hop infield hit.	Boston tied it 1-all on Pedroia's two-out RBI double in the third. Sonnanstine should have been out of the inning, but Iwamura dropped a throw to second on a play that would have been a forceout.	Game notes	 Pedroia's double was his 46th of the season, a club record for second baseman, breaking Jody Reed's mark of 45 set in 1990. ... The Red Sox activated RHP David Aardsma, on the 15-day DL since Aug. 21 with a strained right groin, before the game. ... Francona said RF J.D. Drew, sidelined with a strained lower back since Aug. 18, will see action this weekend. ... Red Sox CF Coco Crisp sat in favor of Ellsbury despite a season-high 11 game hitting streak when he's gone 22-for-43 (.518). "We needed to get Jacoby in there," Francona said. "Coco handled it. I think he wanted to play very badly. If I was Coco I'd want to play very badly, too." ... Maddon said 3B Evan Longoria, out since Aug. 7 with a fractured right wrist, might get into a game over the weekend.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

NEW YORK -- David Wright had an assortment of hits to choose from Wednesday night. There was the long two-run homer in the eighth inning. A sharp double down the left-field line in the first. A leadoff hit in the go-ahead seventh.	Nope. None of those worked for him as the hit that might be the elixir for solving his hitting woes.	Wright preferred the run-scoring blooper, a jammed shot to center in the third for his breakthrough at-bat in the New York Mets' 13-10 win over the pesky Washington Nationals after blowing a six-run lead.	"The at-bat that I drove in the run wasn't necessarily a great at-bat ... but you get the results. All of a sudden you get it in your head that you can relax a little bit," said Wright, who came in hitting .214 (6-for-28) for the month. "One of the biggest problems I've had with runners in scoring position is that it's been in my head that I'm putting too much pressure on myself."	Wright, who scored four runs, has worked hard the past few days in the cage, and on the field Tuesday, taking extra batting practice to work out his struggles, which he said was due to poor timing on his swing.	Well, his timing is back and the Mets couldn't have benefited more on the second straight night New York's starting pitcher -- this time, Mike Pelfrey -- couldn't hold down the lowly Nationals.	"The way that we continue to fight, continue to add on I think this is what championship teams are made out of," Wright said.	The NL East-leading Mets swept the two-game series against Washington and moved 3 1/2 games ahead of Philadelphia.	The Mets rode Carlos Delgado's second straight multihomer game Tuesday night for a 10-8 victory after blowing two leads. On Wednesday, Delgado hit a go-ahead sacrifice fly in the seventh inning, Carlos Beltran had three hits and Jose Reyes swiped a bag to became the Mets career leader for steals.	"I'll tell you what was good about the game was I felt we were going to continue to score," Mets manager Jerry Manuel said. "There have been times during the year where I felt we wouldn't come back."	The Mets began their embarrassing collapse at this point last year, wasting a seven-game lead in the division with 17 games to go. They have 17 games left after this victory over the Nationals, who won five of six against New York down the stretch last year to contribute to its fall.	"I don't think anybody in here is thinking about what happened last year," Wright said. "I just think we're going out and finding ways to win. Last year ... It seemed like everything went wrong. This year when a part of the game goes awry for a day or two another part of the game steps up and gets the job done and that's the big difference."	Delgado's sinking liner scored Wright and gave New York an 8-7 lead. Brian Schneider added had a two-run single off Saul Rivera (5-6) in the inning.	"This happens. We got a lot of runs. [Enough] to win, but they have a lot of good hitters over there," said Cristian Guzman, who homered twice and finished with five RBIs for Washington, which became the first team in the majors to lose 90 games.	Guzman's three-run drive in the eighth ended Brian Stokes' 12-inning scoreless streak and cut it to 11-10 but Wright went deep in the eighth to give New York some room.	Luis Ayala got three outs for his seventh save in eight chances.	The Mets blew a 7-1 lead, but Joe Smith stopped the surging Nats for the second straight night to give the Mets a chance.	Smith (5-3) entered after Aaron Heilman allowed a tying two-run homer to Guzman and pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings.	After the game Manuel said Heilman has been pitching with an injured knee all season. Heilman said he's had tendinitis in his left knee since spring training but it has only affected his pitching on a handful of occasions.	Reyes singled and swiped second in the third inning for his franchise-record 282nd steal, passing Mookie Wilson in only his fourth full season. Reyes then stole third for No. 49 this year and scored his 100th run on Wright's base hit off Odalis Perez for the first of six runs in the inning to go up 7-1.	On the first pitch of the fourth, Pelfrey threw belt-high and inside to Elijah Dukes, who homered over the left-field bleachers in the second. Dukes took several steps toward the pitcher's mound and shouted at Pelfrey. Catcher Schneider and plate umpire Doug Eddings stepped in front of Dukes as Pelfrey raised his hands, questioning Dukes' actions.	After a brief delay where Nationals manager Manny Acta and several coaches and on-deck hitter Kory Casto calmed Dukes down, both benches were warned. Dukes then singled and scored on Wil Nieves' hit to make it 7-2.	"Some people react different than other ones," Acta said of Duke. "It's very common after a homer to get pitched inside. ... I think we'll let it go at that."	In the fifth, Dukes was hit on the right forearm by a pitch from Pelfrey similar to the one that got him agitated an inning earlier. This time Dukes took a slow stroll to first.	Dukes ended his night by egging on the booing Mets fans by waving his arms and blowing a kiss to the crowd as he entered the dugout after grounding out in the ninth.	Game notes	 Mets closer Billy Wagner had elbow reconstruction surgery Wednesday in New York. ... Nationals catcher Jesus Flores jogged and threw for first time since spraining his left ankle in a collision at the plate with Philadelphia's Chase Utley on Sept. 2.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

HOUSTON -- Miguel Tejada has been able to be patient at the plate this season knowing who's hitting behind him.	Tejada's grand slam broke open a close game in the sixth inning and helped the surging Houston Astros beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 7-4 on Wednesday night.	The Astros shortstop is hitting in front of Lance Berkman, who is having a stellar season with 28 homers and 100 RBIs.	"I try to be the most relaxed I can be because I know I have the hottest player in baseball behind me -- Lance," Tejada said. "I have so much confidence in Lance right now, that I'm not looking for a walk or a base hit.	"That's why I'm taking pitches. Right now, I want him to come to the plate with the bases loaded. I was just trying to get one [run in]."	Houston has won five straight and 13 of 14 and remains four games behind Milwaukee in the wild-card chase. The Astros are now 12 games over .500 for the first time since the end of the 2005 season, when they finished 16 games over .500.	Brian Moehler (11-6) went six innings and allowed two runs on five hits.	"Moehler did a good job," Houston manager Cecil Cooper said. "He throws strikes. He was around the zone. I don't even think he had his best stuff but he was able to keep us close."	Jose Valverde pitched the ninth for his league-leading 42nd save in 48 tries. He stretched his franchise record for consecutive saves to 15.	Denny Bautista (4-3) pitched 1 1/3 innings and gave up five runs and three hits.	"Again, we're not hitting our spots when we need to," Pirates manager John Russell said of Bautista. "We put guys on the base against a good hitting team. His velocity is still there, he just didn't have his breaking ball tonight. It was still a good matchup [with Tejada] if he throws the ball the way he is capable."	With the score tied 2-2, Darin Erstad's bases loaded sacrifice fly drove in the go-ahead run in the sixth. A walk to Mark Loretta then set up Tejada's slam. It was Tejada's 11th career grand slam and 13th homer of the season.	Starter Tom Gorzelanny had to leave the game in the third inning with an irritation to his left middle finger. Gorzelanny went 2 1-3 innings and allowed two runs on three hits and two walks. He struck out two.	Houston took a 2-0 lead on Hunter Pence's two-run homer in the second inning. It was his 22nd home run of the season.	Pittsburgh cut the deficit to one on Adam LaRoche's 19th homer of the year in the fourth inning. The Pirates tied it in the fifth on Nyger Morgan's RBI double.	They closed to 7-4 on RBI doubles by Nate McLouth and LaRoche in the eighth inning.	Game notes	 The Astros are considering whether to change the time of their game with the Chicago Cubs Friday from 7:05 p.m. to 1:05 p.m. because of the possibility of Hurricane Ike heading toward the city. A final decision will be announced Thursday morning or afternoon. Officials say the possibility of moving Saturday's game for the same reason will be determined later. ... Tejada's double in the fifth inning gave him an 11-game hitting streak. ... Tejada's slam won $25,000 for Astros fan Linda LeBlanc, whose name was chosen at random to win the money if Houston hit a grand slam in the inning. ... Lance Berkman scored his 110th run of the season matching his career high set in 2001 and 2003. ... Reggie Abercrombie's three hits tied his career high for the fifth time, most recently Sept. 6 at Colorado. ... Valverde's 42nd save is tied for second in Astros history with Brad Lidge in 2005.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.
