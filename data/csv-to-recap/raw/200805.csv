NEW YORK (AP) -- The refrain was the same from almost everyone in the Mets' clubhouse: Offensively, we're coming together.	And how.	Carlos Beltran hit a bases-loaded triple and drove in five runs, and Carlos Delgado and Brian Schneider hit New York's first back-to-back homers of the season to back Johan Santana's first home win for the Mets, a 12-6 victory over the Cincinnati Reds in the opener of a day-night doubleheader Saturday.	David Wright broke out of a 1-for-13 slump with two hits and three runs, helping the Mets score 12 times for the second consecutive game. Moises Alou had two RBIs and New York began a seven-game homestand -- a day after rain postponed the opener -- against last-place teams with an all-around offensive effort despite being outhit 15-12 by the Reds.	"We got some contributions from everybody," manager Willie Randolph said. "We're a much better club than we've shown and played."	In the nightcap, Bronson Arroyo pitched eight dominant innings and Jeff Keppinger had a career-high five hits, lifting Cincinnati to a 7-1 victory.	Randolph started Santana in the opener instead of Mike Pelfrey, Friday's scheduled starter, because "I like to get my best going first," he said. Santana, who was bothered by allergies and didn't have his best changeup, matched a career high by giving up 10 hits, though he never was in serious trouble until the sixth, when he needed 38 pitches to get out of the inning.	"Allergies have been bothering me, but it's no excuse," Santana said. "My eyes, my nose, I battled through and we were able to win. ... When I see my team hitting balls and scoring runs you feel good."	Ken Griffey Jr. went 2-for-5, missing his 598th home run by inches when he hit a drive off the top of the wall in the eighth inning for a two-run double. He and Brandon Phillips, who bruised his left calf Wednesday, were in the lineup to face Santana rather than play in the nightcap because Reds manager Dusty Baker said, "When you're a star you face stars."	But Griffey's performance might have earned him a spot in the nightcap: "That's as good as I've seen him swing, so I think so," Baker said.	Santana (4-2) allowed Edwin Encarnacion's eighth homer in the fourth inning and scattered five other hits through five. But he gave up four hits in the sixth, including a leadoff triple to Phillips and RBI singles to Encarnacion and pinch-hitter Scott Hatteberg. Santana has allowed 10 hits in a game five times, most recently on Aug. 29 for the Twins at Cleveland. The left-hander walked one and struck out five.	"At one point when I looked up at the scoreboard and we had 10 hits and two or three runs, and they had 10 hits and 10 runs, or something like that. The game should have been a lot closer than it was," Baker said. "That's rare, it's real rare."	Alou scored the Mets' first run on Matt Belisle's wild pitch, and New York scored twice in the fifth to build a 6-1 lead after Belisle (1-3) committed a two-base throwing error on Luis Castillo's leadoff tapper.	"I looked up the line and Castillo was closer than I thought and I just kind of slung it from the side," Belisle said. "It was just an unacceptable bad error. There's nothing else I can say."	Beltran's triple off reliever Mike Lincoln in the sixth made it 10-3. The slugger had an RBI single in the third and a sacrifice fly in the fifth for his first RBIs since April 26.	"You can tell when a guy is ready to click. He was reacting short and quick -- two things I look for," Randolph said.	Beltran has noticed a big difference in his at-bats, saying that his approach at the plate is better now, keeping his hands in on his swings.	"Maybe two weeks ago I would have pulled the ball foul," Beltran said of his triple to right field.	Delgado homered off Lincoln with one out in the seventh, his fifth, and Schneider followed with his first of the season.	After beginning the day with a .216 average, Delgado had three hits from the No. 7 spot in the order, missing the cycle by a triple. It was the first time he batted that low since Sept. 30, 1995, with Toronto against the New York Yankees, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.	Delgado and Randolph didn't see his spot in the batting order as an issue or as the catalyst for his breakout game. Randolph said he has "seen this coming for a week and a half." Delgado, who has at least one hit in seven straight games, has been "feeling pretty good at the plate the last few days," he said.	Belisle gave up six runs -- five earned -- and seven hits in five innings.	Game notes	 The Mets and Reds last played a doubleheader on May 19, 1998, and the Mets won both games at Shea Stadium. ... Griffey hasn't homered in 55 at-bats. ... Delgado is 10-for-27 (.370) during his hitting streak. ... It's the first time the Mets have scored 24 runs in a two-game span since July 8-9, 2006, against Florida.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

DETROIT (AP) -- Darrell Rasner is giving the New York Yankees a reliable starter at the back of the rotation, something they've been looking for all year.	Rasner won his second consecutive start since coming up from the minors, Derek Jeter hit his first homer of the season and New York ended a six-game losing streak to the Detroit Tigers with a 5-2 victory Saturday.	After beating Seattle last Sunday, Rasner allowed two runs and four hits in six-plus innings against Detroit's powerful lineup.	"He's been a shot in the arm for us," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "No one says you have to be fancy or overpowering. He's figured out how to use his stuff and he's done it effectively."	Jeter hit a solo shot in the first inning off Jeremy Bonderman, ending his career-long drought of 128 at-bats without a homer to start a season.	"I could really care less," Jeter said with a smile. "I'm just kidding. I wanted at least one."	Rasner (2-0) departed after Magglio Ordonez's leadoff single in the seventh. He walked one -- his first free pass in 12 innings this season.	The right-hander was 4-0 with a 0.87 ERA in five outings at Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre before replacing injured Phil Hughes in New York's rotation. Hughes, Ian Kennedy (now in the minors) and Kei Igawa are winless for the Yankees this year, so Rasner has provided an important boost.	"Every chance I get is a great opportunity and I'm going to do my best to run with it," Rasner said. "I'm not going to strike a lot of guys out, so I can't walk a lot of guys."	Three relievers finished, with Joba Chamberlain pitching the eighth and Mariano Rivera the ninth for his 10th save in 10 chances.	"When you get three down and they've got Chamberlain and Mariano coming in, that's not going to work for you very often," Tigers manager Jim Leyland said. "You might get one, but you aren't going to get three too many times."	The Yankees had lost seven of eight against Detroit dating to last season.	"You don't like to lose to the same team over and over," Girardi said. "They've hit us pretty well, but Raz did a nice job against them."	Bonderman (2-4) lasted just four-plus innings in his shortest start of the year, giving up five runs, six hits and four walks. Bonderman has walked 29 batters in 45 innings this season.	"He didn't locate his pitches again," Leyland said. "It looks like he's dragging his arm, which he's done before. His release point isn't right."	Bonderman fell back into his pattern of first-inning struggles, allowing Jeter's homer before walking Melky Cabrera with the bases loaded.	The Tigers pulled to 2-1 in the bottom half on Matt Joyce's first career homer, although Joyce was initially confused when Yankees right fielder Bobby Abreu broke in on the ball.	"I thought I was going to have to start working out more, because I knew I got all of it, and here he's coming in," Joyce said. "Then I heard the crowd start cheering, so I knew it had gone out. He must have lost the ball, but that was strange."	Unfortunately for the Tigers, that was about all they could muster against Rasner.	"We'd never seen him before, which is tough, and he did a nice job against us," Leyland said. "I'm dumb, I guess, because I was really excited about our lineup against this kid."	The Yankees increased the lead to two on Wilson Betemit's RBI double in the fourth, then made it 5-1 with two in the fifth.	Jeter led off with a single and scored on Abreu's double. Hideki Matsui popped out, but Jason Giambi hit an RBI double to give New York a four-run edge.	After Ordonez chased Rasner to start the Detroit seventh, Miguel Cabrera singled off Kyle Farnsworth and Gary Sheffield hit a run-scoring double.	Edgar Renteria lined to second for the first out, and Farnsworth struck out Ivan Rodriguez before retiring pinch-hitter Placido Polanco to end the inning.	Game notes	 Betemit left after his fourth-inning double with a strained right hamstring and will go on the 15-day disabled list. He will be replaced on the roster by Triple-A infielder Alberto Gonzalez. The Yankees also placed reliever Jonathan Albaladejo (elbow) on the DL and recalled RHP Chris Britton from Triple-A. Britton was sent down Friday to make room for Igawa. ... Rivera has not allowed an earned run in 13 1/3 career innings at Comerica Park. ... Sheffield's RBI was the 1,584th of his career, moving past Al Kaline and into a tie with Harmon Killebrew and Rogers Hornsby for 33rd place. ... The game drew a crowd of 44,580, the second-largest in Comerica Park history behind 44,934 on opening day this season.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Eric Gagne no longer wants to be called the Brewers' closer. He's pitching his way out of that role, anyway.	The former NL Cy Young Award winner gave up a two-run single with two outs in the ninth inning to Ryan Ludwick, and St. Louis held on for a 5-3 victory over Milwaukee on Saturday that snapped a season-long three-game skid.	"I don't deserve that ninth inning right now. It's pretty simple," Gagne said.	The beleaguered reliever was slumped in his locker room chair with his eyes closed for several minutes before putting his hands on his head. After a clubhouse official asked if he wanted to talk, he told reporters he doesn't need a "mental break" like Cardinals counterpart Jason Isringhausen asked for on Friday night.	"I don't need breaks. I need to keep going out there. I need results," said Gagne, who has a major league-leading five blown saves along with Isringhausen. "I get myself in a situation, in a jam, every single time I'm out there. You can't pitch like that."	Prince Fielder hit a tying homer in the eighth for Milwaukee, but the slumping Brewers botched a squeeze play later in the inning and lost for the seventh time in eight games.	Gagne, who signed a one-year deal for $10 million this offseason, has nine saves, but has faltered in back-to-back games, this time in a non-save situation.	Gagne (1-2) gave up consecutive singles to start the ninth. After Aaron Miles hit a 15-foot grounder that advanced the runners, Gagne intentionally walked Albert Pujols to load the bases with one out for Rick Ankiel, who fouled out. Ludwick grounded a single just past shortstop J.J. Hardy to give St. Louis a 5-3 lead.	"I am never nervous in that situation. I love that situation. I have been blessed with that opportunity a lot since I've been here and have been fortunate to come through in a lot of the situations I've been in," Ludwick said. "I feel like that's what baseball is all about -- that situation, being in that moment."	Gagne said his struggles have been embarrassing for him.	"Every time we get a little momentum, I come out there and kill that rally," Gagne said. "It's a matter of going out there and executing your pitches -- not thinking results -- and I'm thinking results. I'm going out there thinking three outs before I can even get one."	Brewers manager Ned Yost refused to pull Gagne from the closer's role immediately after the game.	"I don't sit here and make decisions five minutes after a tough loss. I'll sit and think," Yost said. "You guys have known me long enough, I take a long time to analyze things and give everybody the benefit of the doubt and try to make the right decision."	Ryan Franklin, who took over the closer's role for the Cardinals on Saturday from Isringhausen, got three outs for his third career save and second this year. Still, Franklin said Isringhausen will return after a short break to refocus.	"He's the closer," Franklin said. "Hopefully, we can handle the ninth inning until he gets back."	Chris Duncan hit a two-run homer and the Cardinals built a 3-0 lead against Brewers ace Ben Sheets, who set a franchise record with 1,086 strikeouts.	But Milwaukee rallied for the second consecutive game. The Brewers scored two runs in the seventh on two walks by reliever Kyle McClellan and another in the eighth on Fielder's first homer in 42 at-bats.	Then Milwaukee cost itself a potential big inning. Russ Springer (1-0) relieved left-hander Ron Villone following Fielder's homer, walked two and allowed an infield single to load the bases with one out.	On Springer's first pitch to Jason Kendall, Bill Hall broke from third because the squeeze was on, but Kendall missed the sign. Hall was tagged out in a rundown and Kendall grounded out to end the inning.	"I missed a sign and it's unacceptable," Kendall said. "I cost us the game."	Cardinals starter Joel Pineiro was superb through six innings, allowing just two hits to Ryan Braun before falling apart in the seventh. After Pineiro left with the bases loaded and one out, McClellan walked in Milwaukee's first two runs to make it 3-2.	Sheets struck out six in seven innings. He fanned Pujols on an 0-2 breaking ball in the first to reach 1,082 strikeouts, breaking Teddy Higuera's club mark. Higuera pitched for Milwaukee from 1985-91 and 1993-94.	But there was no celebration in the wake of Gagne's performance.	"Closing is an emotional job," Gagne said. "It's a roller coaster. You do good, you're a hero. You do bad, you're a zero."	Game notes	 Pujols singled to extend his streak of reaching base safely in every game this season to 38. It's the longest run to start a season since Derek Jeter went 53 games in 1999. ... Cardinals 3B Troy Glaus (left triceps) pinch hit after being hit by a pitch Friday night. Glaus, who was still visibly swollen, said he felt "all right" and was expected to return to the starting lineup on Sunday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CHICAGO (AP) -- Alfonso Soriano's warming up, even if the weather isn't. He looked like his old self Saturday and hopes he's put his season-long struggles behind him.	The Cubs star had four hits, including a go-ahead double in a six-run seventh inning, and showed some flair on the bases to help Chicago beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 7-2.	"I feel very comfortable now at home plate. My hands stayed back a little more now and I wait for the ball," Soriano said. "I'm glad I have a big day, more important that we won this game."	Soriano's 4-for-5 performance raised his average from .191 to .223. And slowed earlier this season by a calf injury that landed him on the disabled list, he twice raced home and scored with good slides to send the largest crowd of the season at Wrigley Field (41,597) into a tizzy.	"It happened twice today. I don't like close plays because the catchers are very strong. I think I got safe on both plays," he said.	Kosuke Fukudome's first homer since Opening Day capped the seventh-inning rally as the Cubs won their second straight against the team that swept them in the first round of the playoffs last October.	After a strong performance by Diamondbacks' rookie Max Scherzer, the Cubs trailed 2-1 headed into the seventh when they got to Arizona reliever Chad Qualls (0-4), whose ERA jumped from 0.93 to 2.75 when he gave up four runs and four hits in one-third of an inning.	It was especially disappointing for Qualls after the way Scherzer pitched in just his second major league start.	"It's unbelievable to come out here in Wrigley Field and the environment and do as good as he did," Qualls said, adding he made one bad pitch to Soriano.	"I threw a bunch of good pitches to Soriano. The one mistake I made on him, he hit into the gap."	Mark DeRosa had a leadoff single, Reed Johnson sacrificed and pinch-hitter Daryle Ward dropped an RBI single down the left field line to tie the game.	Pinch-runner Jason Marquis moved to second on a wild pitch and scored on Soriano's double to left center that made it 3-2. When Ryan Theriot singled up the middle, Soriano -- obviously not at full speed -- was still sent home and slid under catcher Chris Snyder after a strong throw from center fielder Chris Young.	"I was a little scared because it is a little cold and I used my legs a lot today," Soriano said of the 47-degree day. "I have to play a little more and be comfortable with my leg."	Aramis Ramirez added an RBI single off Brandon Medders before Fukudome hit his second homer of the season.	In the third, Soriano scored all the way from first after a soft single to right by Theriot. When Diamondbacks' right fielder Justin Upton fumbled the ball for an error and then threw it in to second baseman Augie Ojeda, Soriano broke for home and scored when Snyder couldn't hang on to Ojeda's throw.	Scherzer allowed five hits and an unearned run in six innings. The Diamondbacks' first-round pick in the 2006 draft struck out six, walked one and hit two batters with pitches.	"That's one of the reasons we felt like he was ready for the major leagues. The game doesn't speed up for him," Arizona manager Bob Melvin said. "He's a confident kid and is confident in his stuff and a base runner or two doesn't affect him."	Cubs starter Ryan Dempster gave up only three hits and two runs in six innings. Scott Eyre (1-0), who just came off the disabled list Friday, pitched the seventh.	The Diamondbacks made several nice throws during the game that did catch runners at the plate.	Upton atoned for his earlier error when he caught Derrek Lee's bases-loaded fly ball in the fifth and unleashed a perfect peg to Snyder to easily get Johnson coming home from third.	The Cubs also had a run cut down in the second inning when Ramirez hesitated momentarily off third and then tried to score on Geovany Soto's grounder to second, but was out on a throw from Ojeda.	Arizona, the highest scoring team in the majors managed only one run Friday. On Saturday, they got two in the sixth, thanks to a pair of walks. The Diamondbacks had just four hits.	Ojeda and Stephen Drew opened with singles and one out later, Conor Jackson walked to load the bases. Dempster then walked Upton to force in the tying run before Mark Reynolds hit an RBI grounder to deep short for a 2-1 lead.	Game notes	 Ward was 0-for-14 with six walks as a pinch-hitter this season before his seventh-inning single. ... Arizona 2B Orlando Hudson sat out his fourth straight game with a sore hamstring. ... Eric Byrnes, batting just .225, got the day off for the Diamondbacks. ... It'll be Big Z vs. the Big Unit on Sunday when Carlos Zambrano faces Randy Johnson in a marquee matchup for the series finale.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Omar Vizquel energized the Giants just by being back on the field and playing the Gold Glove defense that so defines him. His three hits were merely a bonus.	It didn't hurt that Tim Lincecum threw strikes all day, either.	Randy Winn hit his first home run of the year, Aaron Rowand connected against his former club for the second time in just more than a week and San Francisco ended a season-worst five-game skid with an 8-2 win over the Philadelphia Phillies on Saturday.	"I hope if I can get hits and get on base that I can help get that energy back," said Vizquel, finally back on the field following Feb. 27 surgery on his left knee. "Overall, no pain so far. Let's see how I wake up tomorrow. I think it's going to be OK."	Lincecum (5-1) struck out eight in eight impressive innings to outpitch 45-year-old Jamie Moyer, and Vizquel had three hits and scored a run in a successful return from the disabled list.	Jose Castillo doubled and matched his career high with four hits, scoring twice for San Francisco. Dan Ortmeier hit a two-run double in the Giants' three-run third and Emmanuel Burriss added a sacrifice fly in the inning.	Vizquel went 3-for-5 batting in the No. 2 hole, part of a balanced attack by the Giants. Rowand followed his second-inning homer with a pair of singles and scored two runs, while Winn also had a solo shot and two base hits.	"You talk about Omar's defense, but he can do a lot offensively," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "He's going to be big in our lineup. He's going to really help us get production throughout the order."	Vizquel received a warm ovation for his first game of 2008, which generated much interest back home in Venezuela. The 41-year-old Vizquel began his 20th major league season about a month later than he'd planned -- becoming the first Venezuelan to play 20 seasons in the majors.	Dave Concepcion and Andres Galarraga each played 19 years in the big leagues, and Luis Aparicio 18.	"I feel honored I've had that chance and really proud that I've been playing this game for that long," Vizquel said.	Vizquel, an 11-time Gold Glove winner at shortstop, was cheered when he stepped into the batter's box in the first inning and again when he hit a sharp single to left.	"Vizquel's a good one, man," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said of his former star with the Cleveland Indians.	Vizquel made his two toughest plays of the day in the ninth inning. He had to scurry backward to make the catch on Chase Utley's popup, then fielded a sharp grounder by Ryan Howard moments later.	"I wanted them straight at me, every ground ball," Vizquel said with a grin.	Howard hit a leadoff homer on the first pitch from Lincecum in the second to give the Phillies a 1-0 lead, then Rowand tied it with his fourth homer leading off the bottom half. Chris Coste also homered for Philadelphia, a seventh-inning solo shot.	Moyer (2-3) faced a pitcher 22 years his junior for the second straight start. The 23-year-old Lincecum was born on June 15, 1984 -- eight days after Moyer signed his first contract. Lincecum grew up in the Seattle area and watched Moyer pitch for the Mariners. Moyer earned his first big league win one day after Lincecum's second birthday.	Moyer took his first road defeat and was done after four innings, his second-shortest outing of the season after going just 3 2/3 innings in his first start.	"It took me until the fourth inning to pick up my tempo," Moyer said. "I'm upset with myself. I had a good bullpen, but didn't maintain it."	Lincecum struck out the side in order in the first on 11 pitches, all on called third strikes. He hit 97 mph on the radar gun.	He retired Jimmy Rollins on three pitches, then set down Shane Victorino on four pitches and Utley on four more.	"I found my rhythm early throwing strikes and fed on that the rest of the game," Lincecum said.	Lincecum, who allowed two runs and four hits, gave himself the lead with an RBI single up the middle in the second. Of his 105 pitches, he threw 74 for strikes.	"You know you have to pick your pitches because you're going to score just one or two runs against him," Coste said.	Rollins was 0-for-4 in his second game back from the disabled list after hitting a two-run homer Friday night and missing the cycle by a triple. He had been sidelined for a month with a sprained left ankle.	Game notes	 Lincecum is 3-0 in four starts following Giants losses. ... Rowand, the Giants' CF, received his first Gold Glove award, for 2007, from Manuel before the game. "It was special to have all these teammates who I played with come up and congratulate me," he said. "If there was ever an individual award I coveted, it was that." Rowand played the past two seasons with the Phillies before signing with the Giants in the offseason. "He doesn't drift mentally out there," Bochy said.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

CLEVELAND (AP) -- Grady Sizemore gave Indians fans a couple of extra mementoes in addition to those they received at the turnstiles.	With all fans taking home a Sizemore souvenir blanket, Cleveland's center fielder sent two baseballs into the seats, too. He homered twice and drove in five runs to support Aaron Laffey's sharp pitching in a 12-0 win over Toronto on Saturday night that sent the Blue Jays to their fourth straight loss.	Sizemore had three hits, including a leadoff homer in a six-run first inning against Dustin McGowan (2-3). Sizemore added a three-run shot in the fifth off Jason Frasor to make it 12-0. Both came on 3-2 pitches and gave Sizemore his second career multihomer game.	"It's exciting to start a game that way, but all homers feel good, I guess," said Sizemore, who has hit six this year.	Cleveland won for the fourth time in five games and defeated the Blue Jays for the ninth straight time at home. Before the game, Toronto learned star center fielder Vernon Wells is expected to be sidelined six to eight weeks with a broken left wrist.	Laffey (1-2) made his third strong start since being recalled from Triple-A Buffalo on April 28. The left-hander allowed six hits, struck out two and walked one in seven innings, lowering his ERA to 1.83.	"It was great to get those runs, enabled me to relax a little," Laffey said. "But with the long innings, I went down in the runway and threw against the wall to stay loose."	He didn't crack any concrete, though.	"I don't throw hard enough to do that," said Laffey, adding that his goal is to pitch to contact and let his teammates field the ball.	That plan worked in the seventh when the Blue Jays got four hits but no runs.	"That's kind of the way things have been going," Toronto manager John Gibbons said. The Blue Jays have scored more than five runs only once in their past 24 games.	Laffey gave up a single, got a double play, then yielded three more singles in the seventh. Quick fielding and strong throws by Ben Francisco in right field on two of the hits kept the Jays from taking extra bases.	Then shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera preserved the shutout with a lunging backhand catch of a line drive off the bat of Jorge Velandia to end the inning.	"Asdrubal was outstanding," Indians manager Eric Wedge said. "He was all over the place at short."	Sizemore homered to open a game for the second time this year and 13th time in his career.	Cleveland had scored only eight first-inning runs in 35 games before sending 10 men to bat and getting six runs, five hits, a walk and sacrifice fly. McGowan also hit Travis Hafner with a pitch, and Brad Wilkerson's error in right field enabled two runners to advance during the rally.	Wilkerson played right field as Alex Rios moved to center in place of Wells. The two-time All-Star was placed on the 15-day disabled list after he was injured making a diving catch Friday night.	"I was erratic," said McGowan. "I couldn't hit a spot. If I was in the zone, it was up. If I tried to go in, I was missing away.	"It was terrible. I kept trying to pound [the zone] and they kept pounding it."	Victor Martinez had an RBI single and Francisco's sacrifice fly made it 3-0. With two outs, Cabrera broke a 1-for-25 slump by slapping a two-run single to left. Casey Blake's RBI single gave Cleveland a 6-0 lead.	Sizemore had an RBI double and Martinez lined a two-run double in the fourth for a 9-0 lead.	"When Grady goes, we go," Blake said. "Not to put pressure on him, but he gives us a jolt at the top of the order."	McGowan gave up nine hits and nine runs over 3 2/3 innings and fell to 5-13 on the road in his career. He became the first Blue Jays starter to fail to work six innings in 15 games -- since he lasted only four innings April 24 against Tampa Bay.	The right-hander had allowed only one run and eight hits over 14 2/3 innings in his previous two starts.	Game notes	 After the game, Indians RHP Tom Mastny was seen shaking hands with teammates. The reliever said he will be sent to Buffalo on Sunday, but the Indians did not announce a move. ... McGowan is 0-2 with an 11.85 ERA in three career starts against Cleveland. ... Martinez went 2-for-3 off McGowan and is 7-for-9 with six RBIs against him. ... Cleveland RHPs Joe Borowski (triceps) and Jake Westbrook (back) threw off the mound Saturday. Borowski, whose 45 saves last season led the AL, has been out since April 15. He could throw a simulated game next week, which would be followed by a minor league rehab assignment. Wedge said he hopes Westbrook, sidelined since April 22, can rejoin the rotation by the end of May.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Proof that baseball is indeed a very funny game: The Atlanta Braves suddenly can't win on the road. And Jason Bay, usually a good road hitter, is discovering a power stroke at home.	Tom Gorzelanny shook off Mark Teixeira's two-run homer in the first inning to shut out Atlanta during the rest of his 7 1/3 innings, Bay homered and the Pittsburgh Pirates extended the Braves' road woes with a 5-2 victory Saturday night.	Bay doubled and scored in the second inning, then followed Jason Michaels' leadoff single with a go-ahead, two-run homer to left-center in the fourth off Chuck James (2-2). Ronny Paulino added a two-run double in the sixth and drove in three runs during Pittsburgh's fifth consecutive victory.	Bay, bothered by a sore knee the last two seasons, is healthier and it shows. He has six homers in PNC Park, where he hit only seven of his 21 homers last season, and is running and fielding much better.	"It's nice when you see the ball well in your own ballpark, where you play 81 times," Bay said. "I don't have an answer for it, but I'm not going to question it."	Going into this season, 72 of Bay's 118 career homers were on the road.	Almost as important to Bay as the homer that put the Pirates up 3-2 was his steal of third in the second inning, the front end of a double steal. The stolen base allowed Bay to score on Paulino's sacrifice fly.	"I didn't have a first step last year or the last part of the year before that, and that's the biggest thing out there running and playing defense," Bay said. "The last two years, I'd get on base and never think about it [running]."	The Braves, who came to Pittsburgh after sweeping a six-game homestand against San Diego and Cincinnati, lost their sixth in a row away from home and are a major league-worst 4-13 on the road. Their home record is 14-4.	Teixeira felt Atlanta caught a bad break in the fourth when James appeared to pick off Michaels at first, only to have umpire Mike Estabrook call him safe. Bay then hit his seventh homer.	"It was a terrible call, he missed it," Teixeira said. "Umpires miss calls. It didn't cost us the game, it hurt, but at the same time they're going to miss calls."	Gorzelanny (3-3), skipped over for a start because of a lower back problem, cruised after a difficult first inning in which Omar Infante doubled and, after a pair of force-play grounders, Teixeira hit an 0-1 pitch deep into the left-field seats for his fifth homer.	Gorzelanny allowed only five singles after that, never allowing a runner past first base as the Pirates' defense turned three double plays. The Pirates turned a fourth double play after Franquelis Osoria replaced him with one on and one out in the eighth.	"In the first, I was trying to prove to myself I was feeling good," Gorzelanny said. "That [homer] was an eye-opener. I was trying to do too much and I left a pitch over the heart of the plate and anybody can hit that. I told myself after that to keep the ball down and let them hit it into the ground."	Gorzelanny struck out four and walked two, following up on a 13-1 win over the Mets on April 30 in which he gave up one hit over five shutout innings until leaving because of the back problem.	Gorzelanny, who walked 12 in his previous two starts and 27 in his first 27 1/3 innings this season, was much sharper while throwing 60 of 92 pitches for strikes.	Matt Capps pitched the ninth for his ninth save in as many opportunities and his 27th in 29 chances since becoming the Pirates' closer last June 1.	James, recalled from Triple-A Richmond to make his fourth start this season, struck out seven but walked four while giving up five runs and five hits over six innings. He pitched 13 shutout innings in two starts against Pittsburgh last season.	"I went back and looked at all the hits I gave up," James said. "They were belt high down the middle. It's tough to win that way. To be successful up here, I have to hit my spots and put the ball on the corners."	Game notes	Chipper Jones went 0-for-3 with a strikeout and a double-play grounder against Gorzelanny after previously being 4-for-5 against him. ... Bay went 2-for-4 and has seven hits in his last 13 at-bats. ... Michaels, acquired in a trade Thursday with Cleveland, went 3-for-4 with three singles and scored twice in his first Pirates start. Nate McLouth, hitting .315, didn't start in center field for the first time this season. ... The Braves placed reliever Buddy Carlyle on the 15-day disabled list with a strained neck.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Has Daisuke Matsuzaka's mythical gyroball finally made an appearance stateside?	The Japanese right-hander had a pitch slip out of his hand in the third inning and land about five feet from the mound before rolling to the plate, one of the few things he did wrong in Boston's 5-2 victory over the Minnesota Twins on Saturday night.	"That's that gyroball," manager Terry Francona cracked. "It's finally emerged. That was interesting."	With help from an unexpected power surge at the bottom of the lineup, Matsuzaka (6-0) remained undefeated, giving up two runs and six hits in seven innings with seven strikeouts.	When he came over from Japan before last season, there were reports that he had a gyroball -- a pitch that spins like a football and can break more than a foot from top to bottom -- among at least four other pitches in his repertoire.	Matsuzaka even released an album of his favorite songs last summer with an original track dubbed "Gyro Ball," but that was the closest anybody came to seeing one in his rookie season in Beantown.	Maybe Dice-K was just waiting for the right moment.	On Saturday night, he twice fanned Joe Mauer, who entered the game with an AL-leading .343 batting average, and used that gyroball to "set up" the first strikeout. After the ball trickled to catcher Jason Varitek, Matsuzaka came right back with a fastball to strike Mauer out.	"Nice changeup, huh?" Matsuzaka quipped.	After walking eight in his previous start against Detroit, Matsuzaka walked three in the first two innings on Saturday night, including one to Carlos Gomez with the bases loaded.	But he didn't issue another walk in his last five innings, keeping his team in the game until the offense finally came through in the seventh inning, albeit in improbable fashion.	Coco Crisp and Jed Lowrie led off with back-to-back homers -- Crisp's first since Sept. 6 and Lowrie's first of his career -- to give the Sox a 3-2 lead and they never looked back.	"I kind of forgot how to run around the bases," Crisp joked. "They were getting on me because I was running too slow."	Mike Lowell and Kevin Youkilis also hit solo homers for Boston and Jonathan Papelbon bounced back from two straight blown saves to get his 11th of the season.	Lowrie went 3-for-4 and finished a triple shy of the cycle. Manny Ramirez went 0-for-5 and remains stuck on 497 career home runs.	In his first big league start, Glen Perkins (0-1) had little trouble with big boppers David Ortiz, Ramirez and Lowell in the middle of Boston's lineup. They combined to go 1-for-9 with a single and no RBIs against the lefty, but the Red Sox got a big boost from hitters No. 8 and 9 in the order.	Perkins took a 2-1 lead into the seventh inning before the light-hitting duo of Crisp and Lowrie spoiled his evening. He gave up three runs and nine hits with three strikeouts in six-plus innings.	Not bad for a guy who was pitching in teammate Nick Punto's cleats and with a glove his wife brought him from home after his equipment never arrived from Triple-A Rochester.	"It is a little ironic. You've got those two guys and got them to ground out a few times, got them to strike out," Perkins said of Ortiz and Ramirez. "And then the eight, nine hitters, those are the guys you don't want to hurt you. You expect the other guys that might do the damage, but that is the game of baseball."	Justin Morneau went 2-for-4 with an RBI for Minnesota and Mike Lamb had three hits, including a popup that hit off a support wire near the Metrodome roof and fell in front of the mound in the ninth.	But the Twins couldn't manage much more against the mystifying Matsuzaka.	"We just couldn't figure out how to get runs off the guy," manager Ron Gardenhire said.	Game notes	 Red Sox RHP Curt Schilling threw from 60 feet as he continues his rehabilitation of a shoulder injury. Schilling said he felt good and will throw again on Monday. ... Red Sox RHP Bartolo Colon made a rehab start on Saturday for Triple-A Pawtucket, allowing one run and four hits in three innings with two strikeouts. ... Twins 2B Brendan Harris (hamstring) missed the game, as did Red Sox SS Julio Lugo (concussion).	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Florida Marlins aren't shocked by their fast start.	"You don't hear anybody saying 'We're in first place,' " catcher Matt Treanor said after Florida routed the Washington Nationals 11-0 on Saturday night for its sixth straight win. "We're not surprised at all."	Dan Uggla drove in five runs and Andrew Miller allowed two hits in seven innings for the NL East-leading Marlins (22-14), who are eight games over .500 for the first time since Sept. 18, 2005. Their winning streak is their longest since they won nine in a row from Aug. 20-29, 2005.	"I think we have a lot of talent," Uggla said. "I think we've got a long ways to go. I think we can continue to get better."	Florida chased Mike O'Connor (1-1) -- making his first start since Sept. 28, 2006 -- during a seven-run fourth inning highlighted by Uggla's second career grand slam.	Miller (3-2) gave up singles in the first to Cristian Guzman and sixth to Felipe Lopez. He struck out seven and walked one. He equaled career highs in innings pitched and strikeouts in winning his third straight decision.	"I think we're pretty good," Miller said. "All the guys in here think we're pretty good. I think we're pretty balanced -- especially if the starting pitcher keeps it up. I pitched pretty poorly early in the year."	Taylor Tankersley worked the eighth and Matt Lindstrom got three outs to complete the three-hitter.	O'Connor's woes started on his very first pitch when Cody Ross drilled his second home run of the year deep into the left-field stands.	"It's good to get on them early and give Andrew some run support," Ross said. "That's all he needed -- just one."	The Marlins scored two runs in the third. Ross scored on a wild pitch and Uggla hit a sacrifice fly to drive in Hanley Ramirez, who is close to finalizing a new contract with the team.	Wes Helms led off Florida's big fourth with his second home run of the year to make it 4-0. Jeremy Hermida singled in a run, Ross scored on reliever Joel Hanrahan's wild pitch and Uggla went deep for his ninth homer of the season.	"After the second inning I felt like I was on track," O'Connor said. "I went up for the fourth inning and I just kind of lost it."	O'Connor gave up nine runs and walked six in 3 1-3 innings.	"Not a very pretty outing," Washington manager Manny Acta said. "He just didn't have it. Just a very poor start."	Hermida also had an RBI single in the eighth.	Game notes	 Marlins OF Josh Willingham, on the 15-day disabled list with a strained lower back, will begin a rehab assignment in the next few days, manager Fredi Gonzalez said. ... Florida 1B Mike Jacobs missed his third straight game with a strained left quad. Gonzalez said he may play Sunday. ... Marlins OF Luis Gonzalez hit the 575th double of his career -- good for 18th place on the career doubles list. ... Nationals 1B Dmitri Young, who's been out since early April with a back injury, will start a rehab assignment early next week at Double-A Harrisburg, general manager Jim Bowden said.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Strong starting pitching, stellar defense and just enough offense to win close games. After a decade of life at the bottom of the AL East, the Tampa Bay Rays are beginning to get things right.	Scott Kazmir pitched six scoreless innings and the improving Rays beat the suddenly punchless Los Angeles Angels 2-0 on Saturday night to hand Joe Saunders his first loss of the season.	One day after James Shields shut out the Angels 2-0 on a one-hitter, Kazmir (1-1) held them to a single and two doubles in his second start since missing all of April with a left elbow strain suffered during spring training.	Tampa Bay starting pitchers haven't yielded a run in their last 23 innings. The defense behind them has been outstanding, too, with the Rays committing just one error in the past 16 games to help the team win five of their last six series.	"It's been fabulous. ... We know that we have good arms. We know that we are physically skilled pitching-wise," Rays manager Joe Maddon said.	"It's what we've been planning to do since spring training, just feed off each other," Kazmir added. "We're going to try to keep the momentum going."	Evan Longoria, who won Friday night's game with a two-run, ninth-inning homer, drove in the only run off Saunders (6-1) when he grounded into a force play with the bases loaded in the first inning.	Saunders, trying to become the AL's first seven-game winner, allowed four hits, struck out three and walked a season-high four in six innings. Teammate Ervin Santana (6-0) will put his perfect record on the line against the Rays in Sunday's series finale.	"They've done a good job on the mound, and we're not swinging the bats and getting enough chances," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "We really only pressured them one inning. Couldn't get that one hit to fall in."	Kazmir, the 2007 AL strikeout champion, spent the first five weeks on the disabled list after hurting his elbow throwing a warm-up pitch for an intrasquad game in February. He lasted four innings, allowing four runs and six hits, in a 7-3 loss at Boston last Sunday.	The 24-year-old left-hander walked three and struck out six against the Angels, who have lost three straight and haven't scored in their last 18 innings.	Trever Miller pitched the seventh, Dan Wheeler worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the eighth and Troy Percival finished up the combined three-hitter for his eighth save.	Tampa Bay won for the 12th time in 17 games and climbed a club-record four games over .500 for just the fourth time in the franchise's 11 seasons. The Rays (20-16) were 16-12 on May 1; 11-7 on April 23, 1999, and 10-6 on April 19, 1998.	The Rays have also won a frachise-best eight consecutive "home" games, including a three-game series they swept from Toronto at Disney World. Kazmir also became the club's career wins leader with 36.	"No runs in six innings," Maddon said. "That's something good to build off."	Saunders limited the Rays to singles by Akinori Iwamura, Jason Bartlett and Eric Hinske in the first four innings. Longoria's bases-loaded grounder to third base drove in Iwamura for the 1-0 lead Tampa Bay held until Carlos Pena's sacrifice fly off Darren Oliver made it a two-run game in the eighth.	The Angels threatened in the fifth when Sean Rodriguez drew a two-out walk and Gary Matthews doubled into the right-field corner to break an 0-for-11 slide. Kazmir escaped when Erick Aybar grounded to short.	Vladimir Guerrero singled, leading off the sixth, for the third hit off Kazmir. The left-hander got Torii Hunter to hit into a double play and retired Juan Rivera on a grounder to short to end his 108-pitch outing.	The Angels squandered their best opportunity to score after Wheeler walked Reggie Willits and Matthews, then issued an intentional pass to Guerrero to load the bases with one out in the eighth.	Wheeler wiggled out of trouble by getting Hunter to pop out and pinch-hitter Garret Anderson to ground to first.	"We weren't able to do much in the batter's box," Scioscia said, "and they were able to do just enough."	Game notes	 Los Angeles placed INF Chone Figgins (strained right hamstring) on the 15-day disabled list after the game. INF Kendry Morales was recalled from Triple-A Salt Lake. ... Aybar, the Angels' shortstop, was back in the lineup after leaving Friday night's loss when he was hit by a pitch in the left pinkie. ... Rays relievers Al Reyes (right shoulder impingement) and Gary Glover (right shoulder tendinitis) threw bullpen sessions. Reyes is expected to pitch in an extended spring training game on Monday. ... RHP John Lackey (strained right triceps) felt good after his final rehab start in an extended spring training game and could rejoin the rotation Wednesday against the Chicago White Sox.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

NEW YORK (AP) -- Throughout his horrendous start to the season, Bronson Arroyo insisted he was fine.	He proved it on Saturday.	Arroyo pitched eight dominant innings to win a matchup of struggling pitchers and Jeff Keppinger had a career-high five hits, lifting the Cincinnati Reds over the New York Mets 7-1 for a split of their day-night doubleheader.	"The tides got to turn at some point," Arroyo said after retiring 16 of his last 17 batters. "You throw it up there enough times and they've got to hit it on the ground eventually -- instead of over infielders heads."	In the opener, Carlos Beltran hit a bases-loaded triple and drove in five runs to back Johan Santana's first home win for the Mets in a 12-6 victory. Carlos Delgado and Brian Schneider hit New York's first back-to-back homers of the season during a makeup of Friday night's rainout.	Ken Griffey Jr. had two hits and an RBI in the nightcap, but remained stalled in his bid to become the sixth player with 600 home runs -- he is homerless in 59 at-bats. He missed No. 598 by inches in the opener when he hit a drive off the top of the wall for a two-run double that earned him a start in the second game.	The Reds outhit the Mets in the loss, 15-12, and the win, 14-4 -- but they also got pitching and defense in the nightcap. They broke open the game in the ninth thanks to two errors by the Mets and Scott Hatteberg's third RBI of the game.	That prompted angry Mets closer Billy Wagner, who entered in the ninth to get some work in, to knock over a water cooler in the dugout after he was pulled.	"Our bullpen -- we just stunk," said Wagner, who was charged with three unearned runs.	Arroyo struck out the side in the first and immediately put to rest any thoughts of a repeat of his awful outing a week ago, when he gave up seven runs in the shortest start of his career -- 1 1/3 innings.	The Mets loaded the bases with one out in the second but Arroyo struck out Ramon Castro, and pitcher Mike Pelfrey (2-3) flied out to right fielder Griffey, who made a basket catch on the run.	"Griffey making that play was big to get out with no runs -- I've been having trouble in the second inning all year," Arroyo said.	Griffey had an RBI single an out after Ryan Freel doubled to lead off the game. The Mets tied it in the third when David Wright hit a run-scoring single an out after Jose Reyes doubled. Griffey then had an assist when Wright was thrown out at the plate on Beltran's double to help end the rally.	The Reds took the lead in the sixth on Hatteberg's double, scoring Keppinger. Hatteberg drove in Keppinger again in the eighth with a single off Duaner Sanchez.	Baffled by his 8.63 ERA entering Saturday despite being healthy, Arroyo struck out the side again in the seventh, then fanned Reyes to start the eighth. The right-hander finished with nine strikeouts and two walks.	"He had them off balance," Reds manager Dusty Baker said. "He was dealing tonight. To go eight innings like he did, makes everybody feel better."	Francisco Cordero worked a perfect ninth to complete the four-hitter.	In the opener, Wright broke out of a 1-for-13 slump with two hits and three runs, helping the Mets score 12 times for the second consecutive game. Moises Alou had two RBIs and New York began a seven-game homestand against last-place teams.	Manager Willie Randolph started Santana in the opener instead of Pelfrey, Friday's scheduled starter, because "I like to get my best going first," he said. Santana matched a career high by giving up 10 hits, though he never was in serious trouble until the sixth, when he needed 38 pitches to get out of the inning.	"Allergies have been bothering me, but it's no excuse," Santana said. "My eyes, my nose, I battled through and we were able to win. ... When I see my team hitting balls and scoring runs you feel good."	But Pelfrey vastly improved on his last two starts in which he gave up five runs and 13 total baserunners in each. He worked six effective innings Saturday, giving up eight hits and two runs. He struck out three and walked one.	Santana (4-2) allowed Edwin Encarnacion's eighth homer in the fourth inning and scattered five other hits through five. But he gave up four hits in the sixth, including a leadoff triple to Brandon Phillips and RBI singles to Encarnacion and pinch-hitter Hatteberg. Santana has allowed 10 hits in a game five times.	Beltran's triple off reliever Mike Lincoln in the sixth made it 10-3. The slugger had an RBI single in the third and a sacrifice fly in the fifth for his first RBIs since April 26.	Delgado homered off Lincoln with one out in the seventh, his fifth, and Schneider followed with his first of the season.	After beginning the day with a .216 average, Delgado had three hits from the No. 7 spot in the order, missing the cycle by a triple. It was the first time he batted that low since Sept. 30, 1995, with Toronto against the New York Yankees, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.	Matt Belisle (1-3) gave up six runs -- five earned -- and seven hits in five innings. He threw a wild pitch that let a run score and committed a two-base throwing error that led to two runs in the fifth.	Delgado batted fifth against Arroyo and extended his hitting streak to eight games with a single in the first inning.	Game notes	 The Mets and Reds last played a doubleheader on May 19, 1998, and the Mets won both games at Shea Stadium. ... Between games, Reds pitcher David Weathers' 8-year-old son, Ryan, took batting practice in center field.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- No shutout this time.	The Texas Rangers still got the victory after a lengthy outing from their bullpen.	Five Texas relievers pitched 8 1/3 innings after Kevin Millwood left with an injury as the Rangers beat the Oakland Athletics 6-4 on Saturday night for their fifth straight win, despite having their shutout streak end at 33 innings.	The bullpen was pressed into service two outs into the game when Millwood strained his groin.	"They did a great job," Millwood said of the bullpen's efforts. "It's great that we won the game and it's great that they did as good of a job as they did. ... They had to throw a lot of innings that they shouldn't have had to throw."	Josh Rupe (1-1) replaced Millwood and yielded two runs in three innings. Frank Francisco, Eddie Guardado and Joaquin Benoit followed with scoreless relief outings for the Rangers, who won their fifth straight series for the first time since Aug. 23-Sept. 7, 2005.	"Unfortunately, [Millwood] had a little hiccup," Rupe said. "We had to pick him up. The guys after me helped me out and did a great job."	Texas pitchers had posted three shutouts in a row and the scoreless streak was the second-longest in franchise history. Oakland ended it with an unearned run in the third inning.	"When we get good starting pitching we can compete with anybody," Texas manager Ron Washington said.	Milton Bradley homered and drove in three runs and Josh Hamilton added three hits for the Rangers, who have won nine of 11 games.	Frank Thomas hit a two-run double in the ninth off C.J. Wilson that cut the lead to 6-4. Oakland's rally fell short when Emil Brown popped out to end the game.	Oakland had won four in a row coming into this series with Texas.	"The last couple of nights, we haven't taken advantage of our opportunities," Oakland manager Bob Geren said. "We've had a hard time getting that key hit."	Millwood recorded two outs and threw 12 pitches before exiting. The Rangers will evaluate Millwood further on Sunday.	"Hopefully it's not bad," Millwood said.	Oakland's Dana Eveland (3-3) allowed three runs, six hits and struck out five over six innings.	Bradley hit a two-run homer off Eveland that gave the Rangers a 3-1 lead in the third. It was just the second home run Eveland has allowed in 47 2/3 innings this season.	"Take away the two pitches I threw to Milton and I threw pretty well," Eveland said.	With two outs in the third, Jack Cust doubled and Thomas walked. On Brown's infield single, Ian Kinsler's errant throw past first baseman Chris Shelton allowed Cust to score and ended the 33-inning scoreless string.	It was longest shutout streak since Baltimore pitchers posted 45 consecutive shutout frames to end the 1995 season.	The longest scoreless innings run in Rangers history is 39 in 1981.	"Those guys are pitching very well and they're swinging the bats well," Geren said. "That's a pretty good combination."	Ryan Sweeney had a sacrifice fly that brought Oakland within 3-2 in the fourth.	Hamilton hit an RBI single in the seventh. German Duran had an RBI double and Kinsler hit a run-scoring single in the eighth to extend Texas' lead to 6-2.	Game notes	 Texas RHP Luis Mendoza, on the disabled list since April 24, threw 45 pitches in a simulated game Saturday. Mendoza will throw a bullpen session Monday before it is decided whether he needs a minor league rehab outing before coming off the DL. ... Thomas hasn't homered since signing with Oakland on April 24 -- a span of 16 games. ... Texas C Gerald Laird went 0-for-4 to end his 10-game hitting streak.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Greg Maddux reached another milestone in his long, brilliant career. It might have meant more to a catcher making his big-league debut than it did to the pitcher with Hall of Fame credentials.	Maddux became the ninth pitcher in big-league history to win 350 games, reaching the plateau in his fifth try and leading the San Diego Padres to a 3-2 win over the Colorado Rockies on Saturday night.	It was just the fifth win in 23 games for the Padres (13-24), who have the worst record in the majors.	"It was kind of cool," Maddux said. "I don't want to make it out to be nothing, but it is May and we haven't been playing that good, and you just really want to win for the right reason and not necessarily for the wrong reason. We need to start winning as a team and hopefully tonight is the start of things to come."	With Adrian Gonzalez hitting a three-run homer and the Padres ending a five-game losing streak, Mad Dog held the Rockies to an unearned run -- set up by his three-base throwing error -- and three hits in six innings. He struck out one and walked none.	The 42-year-old Maddux (3-3) improved to 350-217 in 23 big league seasons. It's another milestone to go along with his four NL Cy Young Awards, one World Series championship and a record 17 Gold Glove Awards.	Catcher Luke Carlin made his big-league debut a day after his contract was purchased from Triple-A Portland. Although he struck out three times, he said he'll never forget catching Maddux and closer Trevor Hoffman in his debut.	"I don't know what to say. It's kind of like all my dreams came true at once, I guess," Carlin said. "It was a privilege, an honor. I'm pretty much speechless."	Hoffman pitched the ninth for his sixth save in eight chances, extending his big-league career record to 530. It was his first appearance since getting a save at Philadelphia on April 30.	Hoffman usually keeps the final ball from his saves, unless the starting pitcher reaches a milestone.	"Trev gave me the ball. That was cool," said Maddux, the only active pitcher with 350 wins and the first to reach the mark since Roger Clemens did it last July 22, against Minnesota. "I'll take any free ball I can get. I'll give it to my kid. Let him go play with it somewhere."	Maddux hadn't won since beating the Los Angeles Dodgers 2-0 on the road on April 13. He followed that with three losses and a no-decision.	Carlin and Maddux talked both Thursday and Friday about how to set up and what pitches Maddux wanted to throw. The pitcher also told the catcher to have fun.	"He made it so easy for me today," Carlin said.	"He did real good -- set up right, gave a very good target and it looked like he had fun," Maddux said. "It's kind of hard to tell sometimes because his mask is on all the time, but it looked like he actually enjoyed being back there. That was pretty cool.	"I was happy for him," Maddux added. "Your first day in the big leagues, trust me, is a lot more special than things you do later in your career."	Rockies manager Clint Hurdle called Maddux "a master craftsman. He's going to go into the Hall of Fame. He stayed away from the barrel, changed speeds and got outs. He was very effective."	Padres manager Bud Black, a former big-league pitcher, said he enjoys watching Maddux pitch. "It's good stuff," Black said. "It's always a fun day when he pitches, for me."	Although Maddux's velocity has declined, Black noted that he still has great movement and can change speeds.	"Greg will have movement when he's throwing to his grandchildren," Black said. "He'll change speeds to his grandson, probably."	Maddux was sharp, including retiring the first seven batters.	His one mistake came when he fielded Willy Taveras' dribbler to the right of the mound leading off the sixth and, in a rare defensive breakdown, threw wide of first baseman Gonzalez. Taveras sped around to third as the ball rolled into the Rockies' bullpen down to the right-field line. Taveras scored on Omar Quintanilla's grounder to third. It was Maddux's first error since May 9, 2007, at Atlanta.	Colorado's Ubaldo Jimenez (1-3) struck out a career-high 11 in taking the loss, allowing three runs and five hits in 6 1/3 innings.	Gonzalez hit an opposite-field homer to left with no outs in the fourth, his ninth. Tadahito Iguchi and Brian Giles walked ahead of Gonzalez, who homered on a 2-2 pitch.	The Rockies pulled to 3-2 in the eighth when Clint Barmes singled leading off against Heath Bell, advanced on a passed ball and scored on Taveras' double to right.

SEATTLE (AP) -- A little trip to Seattle is doing wonders for the Chicago White Sox.	Brian Anderson and Carlos Quentin each homered and combined for five RBIs in the second inning, powering the White Sox to an 8-4 victory over the slumping Mariners on Saturday night.	Javier Vazquez (4-3) allowed six hits and four runs in 5 2/3 innings as the White Sox moved into a first-place tie with Minnesota in the AL Central with their third consecutive win and fourth in five games. The Twins lost 5-2 to Boston.	"This is the type of team that can get on a roll and rip off seven or eight wins in a row," Anderson said.	The Mariners have lost five straight and 10 of their last 11. They've scored just seven runs in their last five games.	The White Sox jumped on Jarrod Washburn (2-5) for six runs in the second inning to take a 6-0 lead.	"It's always nice to get a lot of runs early in the game," Vazquez said. "It makes it real easy."	Anderson hit a three-run homer in the second, his first of the season. Three batters later, Quentin hit a two-run drive, his ninth. Quentin finished 3-for-4 with three RBIs.	"It feels awesome," Anderson said. "Even when I'm getting out, I see what I'm doing wrong."	Chicago manager Ozzie Guillen said Anderson will make his third straight start in center field on Sunday. Anderson has started only nine games this season.	"I don't want to touch the lineup too much," Guillen said. "I want to stay the same way."	Washburn threw 37 pitches in the inning, and allowed eight hits and seven runs in five innings.	"I've definitely never been in a stretch this bad with a team this good," Washburn said. "I've been on a couple teams that weren't very good where we had some real rough stretches. But this team is way too good to be going this bad."	In an effort to revive the offense, the Mariners moved Adrian Beltre to third in the order from fifth, and dropped Raul Ibanez from third to fourth and Jose Lopez from second to fifth. Manager John McLaren said before the game he wanted more punch in the middle of the lineup.	"There were a few games there we didn't have anything, no fire or anything," McLaren said after the game. "Tonight, I could tell there was something there. Even trailing 6-0, guys were determined and they did come back."	Beltre hit his seventh homer in the fourth and added a two-run single in the sixth. Beltre's single broke an 0-for-19 slump by the Mariners with runners in scoring position. Beltre also improved to 15-for-34 (.441) in his career against Vazquez.	Lopez went 1-for-3 with a triple and a sacrifice fly, and Ibanez went 1-for-4.	Seattle had the tying run at the plate with Beltre up and two outs in the seventh. But second baseman Juan Uribe threw out Ichiro Suzuki as he tried to score after Willie Bloomquist stole second following a pickoff move by Octavio Dotel.	"It was a two-out situation and there is a high probability that the last out in the inning was going to be made at second and that is something that must not happen," Suzuki said through an interpreter on his decision to run. "So if there was an out to be made in such a situation, it should be at home plate and not at second base."	Guillen said he understood why the Mariners tried to score on that play.	"We got lucky," Guillen said. "We called the right play at the right time."	McLaren thought the aggressive play by Suzuki might work.	"We weren't trying to steal a run," McLaren said. "Ichiro saw the ball in the dirt [near second] and he took off. The ball came right up to Uribe and he threw home. We are trying to stay aggressive, but it didn't work there."	Game notes	 Anderson, a part-time starter, has hit four of his 11 career homers at Safeco Field. ... Seattle 1B Richie Sexson served the first of a five-game suspension for charging the mound Thursday against Texas. It was originally a six-game penalty but was reduced on appeal. ... Chicago DH Jim Thome, who homered Friday, didn't start so he could have extra rest before Sunday's day game. ... Seattle DH Jose Vidro sat out because of back spasms.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Chris Sampson was struggling badly with the Houston Astros, so pitching coach Dewey Robinson corrected a flaw in his delivery. Bench coach Jackie Moore also reminded the right-hander of what got him to the majors.	The advice worked wonders.	Sampson pitched three-hit ball over seven innings in a 5-0 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Saturday night, and was hopeful that this kind of outing could turn his season around.	"I had a nice heart-to-heart talk with Jackie Moore, because I played for him at Round Rock in '06 and he saw me pitch a lot," Sampson said. "I asked him his thoughts on what was the difference between Round Rock and now, and that helped out tremendously -- as well as figuring out what I was doing wrong mechanically."	Robinson detected a flaw in Sampson's stride and worked with him on shortening it during an extra bullpen session. Sampson combined with Wesley Wright and Oscar Villarreal on the Astros' first shutout at Dodger Stadium since June 23, 1993.	"That's the Chris Sampson we've been looking for," manager Cecil Cooper said. "He was in command throughout. He was really efficient early, pitching down in the strike zone, mixing his pitches in and out, using his changeup and throwing his two-seamer to get the ball to sink and run. That was vintage Sampson tonight."	Sampson (2-3) struck out three and walked one, matching his longest outing of the season. The right-hander had given up 18 earned runs in 15 1/3 innings in his previous four outings.	"It was a big start for him, that's for sure," Cooper said. "I didn't really give a lot of thought to what we might do [with Sampson], but we needed him to be the guy that we saw last year and he stepped up big for us."	Sampson got 11 of his outs on groundballs, including a double-play by Jeff Kent to end the sixth.	The Dodgers' best scoring chance came in the fifth with runners at second and third and no outs. But Chin-lung Hu grounded out to third and pinch-hitter Mark Sweeney lined out to first baseman Lance Berkman, who then made a diving stop of Juan Pierre's grounder in the hole and tossed to Sampson for the third out.	"It was a good feeling out there, but it's only one outing," Sampson said. "We still have a lot to do, and I've got to build on this."	Darin Erstad and Miguel Tejada each drove in two runs for the Astros, who have won seven of their last eight.	Dodgers right-hander Chad Billingsley (2-5) allowed five runs -- four earned -- and six hits in five innings.	"The first two innings, I was getting ahead of hitters and wasn't able to put them away," Billingsley said. "The ball was staying up. They're a good hitting team and they put the ball in play."	The Dodgers have fallen behind 12-0, 7-0 and 5-0 in their last three games, avoiding a shutout with a ninth-inning run in each of the first two. During that stretch, their starting pitchers have allowed 14 runs over the first three innings.	Los Angeles' Rafael Furcal, third in the majors with a .366 average, missed his fourth straight game with a sore lower back.	Billingsley threw two wild pitches and hit a batter during the Astros' three-run first. The second wild pitch put two in scoring position and led to an intentional walk to Berkman. Carlos Lee followed with a sacrifice fly, and Erstad hit a two-run double to right-center with two outs.	Erstad was starting for the eighth time this season and the third time in right field.	"When you get a chance, hopefully you can help out," Erstad said. "I know what my role is here, but it's been a big adjustment and I'm still trying to figure it out. It is what it is, and you just find a way through it."	The Astros increased the margin to 5-0 in the second on Tejada's two-run single with the bases loaded, and probably would have tacked on more that inning had they not run themselves into a pair of outs.	Kaz Matsui tried to advance two bases on Tejada's hit, but was erased in a rundown between second and third after first baseman James Loney cut off right fielder Matt Kemp's throw toward the plate. Tejada attempted to score on Berkman's double into the right-field corner, but second baseman Kent took Kemp's relay and threw to Russell Martin for the tag on Tejada.	Game notes	 Actress Pamela Anderson threw out a ceremonial first pitch, then posed for pictures with Dodgers manager Joe Torre by the dugout. ... Berkman was 2-for-3. He has 20 hits in his last 27 at-bats, raising his average from .295 to .386. ... Astros pinch-hitters are 6-for-46 with one RBI. Erstad is 2-for-17 with a walk in that role, while Jose Cruz Jr. is 1-for-15 with five walks. ... Astros CF Michael Bourn stole his major league-leading 17th base in the seventh. He has yet to be caught. ... 3B Blake DeWitt became the seventh different hitter to bat in the second spot for the Dodgers this season, and the fifth in as many games.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

NEW YORK (AP) -- Oliver Perez plays baseball like a kid in a school yard -- hitting, pitching, stealing bases, experimenting with different arm angles.	All were on display in the New York Mets' 8-3 win over the Cincinnati Reds on Sunday in which the left-hander earned his first win since April 19.	"He might drive you nuts every once in a while," New York manager Willie Randolph said, "but he competes, man."	The day's oddest moment came not from Perez but the Reds, who batted out of order in the ninth inning after an earlier double switch. Sorting it all out resulted in a 10-minute delay.	Outfielder Corey Patterson was charged with an out when backup catcher David Ross came to the plate instead of him in the No. 8 spot and lined out. Ross had to hit again, and this time he singled.	The Mets, who hadn't hit back-to-back home runs all season before Saturday, did it for the second straight day. Carlos Beltran and Ryan Church went deep in the fifth inning as their offense continues to show hints of finding the consistency that's been lacking much of this year.	The Mets have at least 11 hits in four of their last five games. The one exception was a 7-1 loss in the nightcap of Saturday's doubleheader, in which they managed just four. They had that many in a three-run first inning Sunday.	Jose Reyes led off with a single, stole second and scored on Luis Castillo's triple.	Castillo ripped a line drive to right-center between Ken Griffey Jr. and Ryan Freel. Griffey pulled up at the last second, while Freel dived unsuccessfully for the ball, which rolled all the way to the wall.	"We had a little communication problem," Freel said, "but it was also tough to read the wind out there."	Castillo felt discomfort in his left quadriceps on the triple and later left the game.	Doubles by Beltran and Moises Alou off rookie Johnny Cueto (2-4) drove in two more runs.	Beltran has nine hits in his last 22 at-bats, including his two-run homer in the fifth. Church followed with his drive to put the Mets up 6-0. Carlos Delgado and Brian Schneider went back-to-back in the first game of the doubleheader.	Beltran's homer was his first since April 24 and just his third of the season after hitting 33 last year.	"I don't want to say that I'm perfect, but it's getting close," said Beltran, who explained that his left leg has been weaker than his right, which has affected his hitting.	Reds shortstop Jeff Keppinger had a hit in seven straight at-bats before striking out in the eighth. He went 5-for-5 in Saturday's nightcap before adding a single and triple Sunday.	Randolph doesn't want Perez (3-3) to improvise with different arm angles, believing it messes with his rhythm. After allowing just one hit through five innings, Perez ran into trouble in the sixth. A walk, double, triple, wild pitch and three deep flyball outs resulted in the Reds pulling within 6-3 -- and meant Perez still hasn't pitched into the seventh this season.	Perez dropped down on that wild pitch.	"I was trying to change speeds," he said. "I was tired."	Sounding exasperated and amused at the same time, Randolph said, "That's Ollie."	That's Ollie also applied to Perez catching the Reds napping after he walked in the second inning -- he stole second without a throw for his third career steal (all against Cincinnati). He added a bunt single in the fourth when he noticed third baseman Edwin Encarnacion playing back.	The Mets got two insurance runs in the bottom of the sixth. Reyes' hard grounder down the third-base line went under Encarnacion's glove for a two-out double to start the rally. Damion Easley, who had replaced Castillo at second, drove him in. The Mets added another run on a David Wright single with the help of a wild pitch that moved Easley to second.	Griffey remained stalled at 597 home runs in his bid to become the sixth player with 600. He went 0-for-2 with two walks and hasn't homered since April 23.	Game notes	 The Mets announced that Jets Night at Shea has been rescheduled for July 8 before their game against the San Francisco Giants. Former Jets players including Pro Bowlers Joe Klecko and Wesley Walker will be honored during a pregame ceremony. The original event was rained out April 28. The Jets played at Shea from 1964-83. ... Reds left-handed hitters Joey Votto, Paul Bako and Adam Dunn each struck out twice against Perez. ... Mets reserve outfielder Angel Pagan, who bruised the labrum in his left shoulder Wednesday, returned as a pinch hitter. ... The Mets have yet to pick a starter for Wednesday's game against Washington. They will probably call up a minor leaguer, Randolph said. ... This was the Reds' last scheduled appearance at Shea before the Mets move to a new park next year. Their record there is 126-131.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dan Uggla has no explanation for his sudden power surge.	Uggla's second home run on Sunday was a go-ahead drive in the eighth inning that lifted the Florida Marlins to their seventh straight win, 5-4 over the Washington Nationals.	Uggla had seven RBIs and three homers in the final two games of Florida's three-game series sweep; he hit a grand slam and had five RBIs Saturday.	"I'm not good at analyzing and knowing what's going right or anything like that," said Uggla, who has 11 homers this season. "I'm just trying to stay aggressive, and that's about all I can tell you."	The Marlins have relied on the homer all season, and Sunday was no different. Trailing 4-2 in the eighth, Jeremy Hermida hit a two-run shot off Luis Ayala (1-3) and Uggla added his drive for Florida's 53rd home run this season, second in the majors behind Philadelphia's 54 entering Sunday.	Florida starter Scott Olsen, who gave up six hits and four runs in six innings, said he didn't have his usual stuff, but knew the offense would bail him out.	"Four runs for us can happen in a blink of an eye," Olsen said. "Once they got four runs, I figured that was about it -- that was as far as I could stretch them before we got the game out of hand. Our offense, all year they've been picking us up and they continued to do it today."	The Marlins won all six of their games at Nationals Park, which opened this season, and their seven-game win streak overall is their best run since winning nine straight in August 2006.	Logan Kensing (2-0) pitched a scoreless seventh inning for the win, and Kevin Gregg worked the ninth for his seventh save in eight chances.	Washington's Aaron Boone had a homer, triple and single with two RBIs in the loss.	"Everyone ought to be a little ticked off right now -- anytime someone comes in and sweeps you," Boone said.	The Nationals took their first lead of the three-game series in the third inning. Ronnie Belliard hit a two-run homer, his second of the season, to give Washington a 3-1 lead. Ryan Zimmerman followed with an infield single and then scored when Boone tripled.	Shawn Hill allowed two runs on five hits and struck out three in seven innings for the Nationals, but got a no-decision for the fifth time in five starts this season.	"He kept us off balance and off the bases most of the day," Hermida said. "He threw real well. Fortunately, we were able to get to that bullpen and take advantage of it when we did."	Alfredo Amezaga led off the eighth against Ayala with an infield single. The next batter, Hermida hit a tying two-run home run to right-center.	Then with two outs, Uggla put the Marlins ahead with a shot over the out-of-town scoreboard in right field. Uggla homered to left-center in the fifth inning.	"This one is a little more discouraging because everything goes through your fingers in one inning," Washington manager Manny Acta said.	Uggla scored the Marlins' first run in the second inning. After being hit by a pitch, he advanced to third on a bloop single by Luis Gonzalez, and then came home on Wes Helms' sacrifice fly to center.	Boone tied the game at 1 in the bottom half with a leadoff home run.	Game notes	 Florida 1B Mike Jacobs missed his fourth game with a strained left quad. Manager Fredi Gonzalez said Jacobs may be ready to play Monday in Cincinnati Florida OF Josh Willingham, on the 15-day DL with a strained lower back, had his rehab assignment postponed by a couple of days after feeling tightness Saturday, Gonzalez said. The Nationals optioned LHP Mike O'Connor to Triple-A Columbus and recalled RHP Chris Schroder from the Clippers after the game OF Elijah Dukes made his first start for the Nationals since Opening Day. Dukes, who had been sidelined until Friday with a hamstring injury, was 0-for-4 Several players on both teams used pink bats in a league-wide effort to celebrate Mother's Day and raise breast cancer awareness. Hermida said after his big day, he wanted to keep using the pink bat. "I don't know if they'll let us, but I'll try," he said.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Carl Crawford has played more games for Tampa Bay than any player in team history, so it was fitting that he delivered the blow that lifted the Rays into uncharted territory.	The surging Rays climbed five games over .500 for the first time in the club's 11 seasons, with Crawford hitting a three-run homer, stealing two bases and scoring twice Sunday to pace an 8-5 victory over the Los Angeles Angels.	"We feel like we're going to win every game right now," the two-time All-Star said after Tampa Bay stopped Ervin Santana from becoming the AL's first seven-game winner. "We know that's not possible, but we have the confidence to feel that way."	Santana departed with a 5-4 lead with one runner on and two outs in the sixth inning, but the game quickly shifted when Justin Speier (0-3) entered and gave up a double to Akinori Iwamura and Crawford's third homer of the season.	B.J. Upton doubled for the third consecutive hit off the Angels reliever. He took third base on a wild pitch and scored on another wild pitch by Speier, who struggled for the second time in three days against the Rays.	Evan Longoria's two-run, ninth-inning homer off Speier gave Tampa Bay a 2-0 win in the series opener Friday night. The Rays won by the same score Saturday, holding the Angels to a total of four hits in the two games.	"There's nothing they did that surprised us," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "They're a team that has a lot of positive things happening."	The series sweep left Los Angeles with a four-game losing streak for the first time since April 2007. The Rays (21-16) are five games over .500 for the first time at any point in a season, and it's the latest they've ever been in second place.	Crawford went 3-for-5, raising his batting average to .289. He leads the AL in runs scored (30) and has 12 stolen bases, four in the last four games.	"C.C. still hasn't taken off yet, but the guy is pretty clutch," Rays manager Joe Maddon said. "He's come up with some big hits for us already in crucial moments, and obviously [the homer] did turn the tide for us."	Although Santana remained unbeaten, Tampa Bay prevented an Angels starter from becoming the league's first seven-game winner for the second straight day. Joe Saunders lost for the first time in seven decisions on Saturday.	J.P. Howell (2-0) pitched three scoreless innings in relief of Andy Sonnanstine to get the victory. Troy Percival worked the ninth for his ninth save in 10 opportunities.	Garret Anderson and Torii Hunter drove in two runs apiece for the Angels, who finally showed signs of life on offense. Slumping Vladimir Guerrero went 2-for-4 and drove in a run for just the fourth time in 23 games.	Santana, coming off a four-hit shutout of Kansas City, allowed three runs on four hits in the first six batters Sunday. Floyd, Upton and Longoria had the RBIs for Tampa Bay, which also had been struggling at the plate the past week.	The Angels snapped a streak of 20 consecutive scoreless innings with RBI singles by Guerrero, Anderson and Hunter in the third inning, however Santana quickly fell behind again.	Upton and Carlos Pena singled to start the bottom of the third. Floyd, in his first action since coming off the 15-day disabled list, followed with his second run-scoring single to give Sonnanstine another lead the Tampa Bay starter couldn't hold.	Anderson's RBI single and Hunter's run-scoring triple turned the Angels' 4-3 deficit into a 5-4 lead and ended Sonnanstine's afternoon. The Rays starter gave up eight hits, walked two and struck out three.	Santana allowed five runs and eight hits -- both season highs -- in 5 2/3 innings. He walked one and struck out seven, including the last batter he faced. But with the starter at 113 pitches, Scioscia turned to Speier.	"Put these two loses, Friday and today, on me. I just haven't made my pitches like I normally could," Speier said.	"I'll iron it out. Sometimes, getting into a funk, you try to figure too much out. Sometimes less is more. I'm just going to go out there, continue making pitches and get out of this thing."	Game notes	 Crawford finished 3-for-5, stole two bases and scored two runs. ... Speier has allowed five homers in 15 innings this season. ... Angels INF Howie Kendrick's strained left hamstring will be reevaluated on Monday. He went 3-for-3 in a rehab game with Class A Rancho Cucamonga last Tuesday, but experienced some tightness in the hamstring. ... Rays INF Ben Zobrist will have the pins removed from his broken left thumb on Monday and could be activated during this week's series against the New York Yankees.

MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The ninth inning for the Milwaukee Brewers' new closer by committee was as adventurous as some of Eric Gagne's recent outings. There was one difference, though: the Brewers held on for the win.	With Gagne yanked from the closer's role Sunday after faltering in back-to-back outings, relievers Salomon Torres and Brian Shouse helped make Jeff Suppan's seven solid innings stand up by holding on for a 5-3 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals.	"I feel good about every reliever I've got down there," Brewers manager Ned Yost said. "These guys make their money by being ready."	Ryan Braun homered twice for the Brewers, who won for the second time in nine games.	Torres was called on to protect a 5-2 lead in the ninth. He gave up a leadoff double, but retired the next two batters before walking Cesar Izturis, who was 0-for-3.	Yost then brought in left-hander Shouse, who gave up an RBI single to pinch-hitter Yadier Molina. But he got Adam Kennedy to groundout for his first save this season and fifth of his career.	Shouse doesn't expect to be called on to close too frequently in a Brewers' bullpen that includes Guillermo Mota and David Riske, who allowed a homer in the eighth to Ryan Ludwick that made it 4-2.	"I'm just down there waiting for the phone to ring," Shouse said. "I'm not going to get most of those things. It's going to be Mota, Torres and Riske. I'm not going to be too much of a part of that, I wouldn't think."	The relievers preserved the victory for Suppan (2-2), who became the first Milwaukee starter other than Ben Sheets to win a game since Manny Parra beat San Francisco on April 5. Suppan worked himself into and out of trouble all afternoon, allowing a run on seven hits with four walks in seven innings of work.	But he was able to prevent the big inning that has plagued the rotation for much of the season thanks to four strikeouts and four base-running gaffes by the Cardinals.	Albert Pujols walked twice and singled to extend his streak of reaching base safely in every game this season to 39.	But the Cardinals' slugger ran into three of St. Louis' four outs on the basepaths when he was picked off in the first, caught trying to advance to third on a single by Chris Duncan in the third and doubled off second on a line drive out in the sixth.	"He's an aggressive baserunner and sometimes that happens. Fortunately, we were able to capitalize on mistakes like that," Suppan said of his former teammate.	Said St. Louis manager Tony La Russa: "It wasn't a crisp game from the Cardinals' side."	The Brewers scored twice off St. Louis starter Braden Looper (5-2) in the first inning on a sacrifice fly by Prince Fielder and Corey Hart's double.	Braun homered in the third and fifth innings to give Milwaukee a 4-1 lead, while J.J. Hardy went 3-for-4 with two triples and an RBI.	"I've been swinging the bat great lately," Braun said. "It's nice to contribute, and even better that it came in a win -- a big one."	Looper allowed four runs on seven hits and one walk in six innings, but was disappointed with his pitches to Braun.	"I left two balls up to him and he essentially did what you're supposed to do with them," Looper said. "He made me pay."	Ludwick struck out three times for St. Louis before hitting his solo homer that made it 4-2. The Brewers added a run in the eighth when Hardy doubled home Bill Hall.	Game notes	 La Russa said he made a "dumb call" when he put on a hit-and-run in the fourth. The Brewers pitched out and easily retired 3B Troy Glaus at second for the other baserunning blunder. Glaus (left tricep) was back in the lineup after sitting out Saturday's game after being hit by a pitch Friday night. ... Pujols extended his hitting streak to 11 games. ... Brewers CF Mike Cameron sat Sunday. He's batting just .174 with three homers and eight RBIs since joining the team last month following a 25-game suspension.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Twelve straight losses to the Baltimore Orioles was a dirty dozen for Kansas City Royals.	Brian Bannister allowed two singles in eight innings and the Royals beat Baltimore 4-0 Sunday to end their skid against the Orioles.	It was Kansas City's first victory over Baltimore since July 25, 2006.	"Regardless if you were here all 12 of those losses, I think we needed to take it on ourselves to end this thing," Bannister said. "As a starting pitcher, a shutout is the best medicine to end a losing streak. To beat this streak and to beat my own personal losing streak, there were a lot of factors going into it, so I was pretty motivated to pitch a great game."	Bannister struck out five and walked two to end a personal four-game losing streak. He did not allow a runner to reach second. Joakim Soria tossed a perfect ninth to finish Kansas City's fourth shutout of the year.	The mounting losses to the Orioles had begun to wear on the Royals.	"I hurt as badly losing that many games in a row to the Baltimore Orioles as if I had been here for all of them," Royals rookie manager Trey Hillman said. "I want to turn the pride factor up for this organization as high it can possibly be turned up. It's irrelevant that it wasn't exactly the same group of guys, or the same staff or the same manager. Losing that many games in a row to anybody is embarrassing."	Bannister, who won his first three starts of the season, was 0-4 with an 8.02 ERA and had allowed 33 hits in 21 1/3 innings over his previous four starts.	"I had a hot streak and I had a cold streak," Bannister said. "The benefit of having a cold streak, if there is one, is you can step back, work on some stuff, look at how you were throwing when you did well, regroup and build up your confidence again. I made some changes and sometimes that's all it takes for you to go out there and pitch well.	"My last couple of games my confidence was a little low. I pitched around contact a little bit and that leads to the big swings. I was able to get ahead and make pitches on my terms today."	He held the Orioles to one hit -- a Guillermo Quiroz line drive single to right in the third -- in the first six innings and quickly erased him when Luis Hernandez grounded into a double play. The only other hit Bannister (4-4) allowed was a two-out Luke Scott single in the seventh.	"Bannister had everything today -- curveballs, cutters, sliders, fastball," Quiroz said. "He was locating everything."	Brian Burres (3-4) allowed four runs and nine hits in six-plus innings for the Orioles.	The Royals led 2-0 after six innings. Jose Guillen singled and scored on Mark Teahen's base hit in the second. Guillen also doubled in Alex Gordon in the third.	"Burres was walking a tightrope," Orioles manager Dave Trembley said. "Late in the game he walked the No. 9 guy [Joey Gathright]. That's a no-no, but he kept us in the game. We just didn't get anything off Bannister. He pitched a better game."	Burres, who has lost three consecutive starts, left after walking Gathright and allowing David DeJesus' single with no outs in the seventh. Gathright eventually scored when Gordon grounded into a fielder's choice, and Billy Butler singled in DeJesus.	"I didn't have good command of my off-speed pitches, so I was working mostly with my fastball," Burres said. "It was the only thing I could throw for strikes and its hard to pitch like that the whole game. The seventh kind of got away from me. I made it tough on myself by twice walking leadoff batters."	Gathright took an extra-base hit away from Adam Jones when he made a leaping catch before crashing into the center-field fence in the second.	Game notes	 Orioles RF Nick Markakis walked twice and has reached base in 35 of 37 games. ... Guillen went 5-for-11 in the series against the Orioles, raising his average from .185 to .207. ... The previous two-hitter by the Royals was RHP Zack Greinke and Soria combining on a 3-0 shutout of the White Sox on Sept. 20, 2007.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Emil Brown and the Oakland Athletics used an aggressive approach to jump-start their offense.	Brown hit a three-run homer and drove in four runs to help the Athletics beat Texas 12-6, ending the Rangers' season-best five-game winning streak Sunday.	"I'm not a walk guy," Brown said. "I'm just ready to hack."	Frank Thomas drove in two runs to give him 1,695 RBIs, tying him with Cal Ripken for 21st all-time, and Mark Ellis had three hits for the A's.	The A's pulled off two double-steals, hit early in the count and took advantage of eight walks and two errors to lift an offense that had scored three runs or less in seven of their previous 11 games.	Ian Kinsler had three hits for the Rangers, who had won nine of their previous 11.	With the game tied at 6, Bobby Crosby led off the seventh with a double, then stopped at third on Ellis' single. Rangers reliever Franklyn German's pickoff attempt had Ellis in a rundown between first and second, but when Crosby broke for the plate, Rangers first baseman Frank Catalanotto threw late to catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia as Crosby scored to put the A's in front.	"We got a little lucky," A's manager Bob Geren said. "They got us and we got away with it."	Rangers manager Ron Washington said his team worked on defending the double steal in spring training, "but we didn't execute. They beat us in execution."	Ryan Sweeney added a sacrifice fly later in the seventh to extend Oakland's lead to 8-6, and Brown's RBI single in the eighth made it 9-6.	Daric Barton added a two-run homer in the ninth for Oakland.	German (1-1) gave up two runs and three hits in 2/3 inning to pick up the loss.	Santiago Casilla (2-0) allowed two hits in 1 1/3 innings for the victory.	Rangers starter Sidney Ponson allowed six runs and seven hits in 5 1/3 innings, his worst outing of the four starts since his contract was purchased from Triple-A Oklahoma on April 26.	The A's activated Rich Harden from the 15-day disabled list to make his first start since April 2, but he couldn't hold a four-run first-inning lead. Harden was placed on the 15-day disabled list April 10 with a strained right shoulder.	In the first, Thomas' RBI single and Brown's fourth homer of the season gave the A's a 4-0 advantage.	Ponson tried to throw a sinker down and away to Brown but left the pitch over the plate.	"I didn't have any command of any pitch today," Ponson said. "It's one of those days where you know you don't have anything, you just try to mix your pitches and they hit the ball on the ground. But they didn't do that at all today. It was a souvenir. He did what he's supposed to do."	Saltalamacchia's two-run single in a four-run third tied it for the Rangers, who took a 5-4 edge in the fourth on Josh Hamilton's RBI triple.	Harden allowed five runs and eight hits in 3 2/3 innings.	"First time out, I'm somewhat happy," said Harden, who's been on the disabled list six times in the last four years. "Obviously I didn't get that many innings in and gave up some runs, but I wasn't disappointed. The second and third innings went by so quick, I didn't get much of a rest."	Ponson walked Jack Cust with the bases loaded in the sixth as the A's tied it at 5, and Thomas followed with a sacrifice fly off German to give Oakland the lead.	Game notes	 To open a roster spot for Harden, OF Chris Denorfia went on the 15-day DL because of tightness in his lower back. ...Texas placed RHP and No. 1 starter Kevin Millwood on the 15-day disabled list due to a strained right groin. RHP Doug Mathis was called up from Triple-A Oklahoma to take Millwood's roster spot. Mathis, awaiting his major league debut, will begin in the bullpen but is a candidate to get a spot start on May 20, the next time there's an opening in the Texas rotation. ...Texas also outrighted RHP Kazuo Fukumori, currently with Oklahoma, off the 40-man roster. ...All of the Rangers and a few of the A's used pink bats in honor of Mother's Day and to promote breast cancer awareness. The teams combined to go 12-for-47 with the pink bats. ...The Rangers are 0-18 when trailing after seven innings. ... Ellis left the game in the ninth for a pinch runner after sustaining a minor hamstring strain. He's listed as day-to-day. ... A's 3B Eric Chavez will begin a rehab assignment at Triple-A Sacramento on Thursday. Chavez is on the 60-day DL after offseason back surgery.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CHICAGO (AP) -- Daryle Ward was so sure he would play in the majors that he practiced his signature as a kid. He may get a few autograph requests after his latest big hit.	Ward delivered a pinch-hit, two-run double in the eighth inning, and the Chicago Cubs rallied again to beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 6-4 Sunday after the anticipated showdown between Carlos Zambrano and Randy Johnson got wiped out.	"I love the game of baseball," Ward said. "It's something I knew that I was going to do when I was about 3 years old."	Carlos Marmol (1-0) struck out two in a perfect eighth and Kerry Wood pitched the ninth to earn his seventh save in 10 chances and finish off Chicago's three-game sweep of the NL West leaders.	Heavy rain and temperatures in the mid-40s delayed the start of the game by 58 minutes, and Zambrano and Johnson were spectators when it finally began. By the time the game ended, the Cubs had used another late rally to beat Arizona, the team that swept them in the playoffs last year.	Reed Johnson tied it at 4 with a two-run homer off Juan Cruz with one out in the seventh after Mike Fontenot walked. Cruz then walked Ryan Theriot before Tony Pena (0-1) got Derrek Lee to hit into a double play, but the Cubs struck again in the eighth.	Pena intentionally walked pinch-hitter Alfonso Soriano to load the bases with one out and set the stage for Ward, who drove the ball to right-center to make it 6-4.	"Well, I'm not going to let Soriano beat us right there," Arizona manager Bob Melvin said. "We've got to have a chance for a double-play ball and we've got [Ward] hitting (.174) up there. That's really not that tough of a decision."	Ward also tied it with a pinch-hit RBI single in Chicago's 7-2 victory over Arizona on Saturday.	Most days, Ward follows a heavy regimen of stretches and massages in case he gets called.	"Sometimes, you're a little bit lazy and say, 'I don't want to do it," said Ward, third among active players with 74 pinch hits. "But you have to. I feel like I'm making a good example for some of the younger guys that are playing on the bench. They do some of the same things I do, and it's been working for all of us."	It's a lot of effort for about a minute of activity.	"Was it even a minute?" he asked on Sunday.	No one was sure, exactly. They just knew his timing was perfect, as was Reed Johnson's.	Stuck in a 4-for-34 slump over the previous 11 games, he drove his first homer through a driving wind about halfway up the bleachers.	"The last week or so, we really haven't been playing that well so I think this was a good confidence boost," said Johnson, signed to a one-year deal in late March after Toronto released him.	Arizona's Edgar Gonzalez was in line to get the win until Johnson went deep.	Recently booted from the rotation, Gonzalez allowed two runs and five hits before being lifted for a pinch hitter in the sixth. One of those hits was a solo homer by Lee that gave Chicago a 2-1 lead in the third.	Cubs starter Sean Gallagher carried the lead into the fifth but couldn't make it out of the inning. Reliever Chad Fox wasn't much help, either, walking in two runs that inning.	Gallagher allowed four runs and five hits over 4 1/3 innings in his first major league start and likely will get another one against Pittsburgh this week. The 22-year-old right-hander had made two appearances this season after posting an 8.59 ERA in eight relief outings while splitting time between the majors and minors last year.	If the Cubs caught a break by missing Randy Johnson, who's 12-0 against them, it was tough to tell.	Lee's homer aside, they did little against Gonzalez.	"He did a pretty good job of keeping the ball down and got a lot of groundballs," Arizona catcher Miguel Montero said. "He got ahead in the count, which I thought was a big key for him."	Game notes	 A fan wearing a white sweat shirt jumped out of the bleachers and got tackled in center field by two security guards. ... The Diamondbacks held out 2B Orlando Hudson, who was expected to miss his sixth straight game with a strained right hamstring. ... Randy Johnson will pitch Tuesday against Colorado. ... Zambrano will pitch Monday against San Diego, followed by Jason Marquis. The rotation is unclear beyond that.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The San Diego Padres suddenly look like a whole different team.	Before fans get too giddy, though, they need to remember that the local nine are still stuck in the basement of the big leagues.	Scott Hairston and Khalil Greene homered to spoil Greg Reynolds' major league debut, leading the Padres to a 6-1 victory over the Colorado Rockies on Sunday and their first series win in nearly a month.	The Padres have been playing so poorly that their two straight wins match their season high, which they've managed only three times.	"It was good to see," manager Bud Black said. "We think it's in there. The players do. The staff does, so it's good to see it showing. Hopefully we can continue it. It was more like we expect to play baseball. Good pitching, good bullpen work, solid defense, a couple homers."	After winning for just the sixth time in 24 games, the Padres (14-24) continue to have the worst record in the majors. They head back out on the road, starting with four games at NL Central-leading Chicago.	"The last two games are what we expect," Black said. "We've got to do more of that, obviously, to climb out of this hole and get back to where we think we should be. But it's good."	San Diego had lost eight consecutive series before taking two of three from the defending NL champion Rockies. The Padres hadn't won a series since winning two of three on the road against the Los Angeles Dodgers on April 11-13.	"This is something to build off of, I guess," Greene said. "It gives you a different feeling. More than anything, whether you're winning or losing, I think it's just playing well and having guys play good defense and pitch well and swing the bats. And if you can do that more often than not you're probably going to be successful more often than not."	Reynolds (0-1) and Chris Young (3-3) had been locked in a scoreless duel until Hairston hit Reynolds' first pitch of the sixth inning just a few feet inside the foul pole on the side of the Western Metal Supply Co. brick warehouse in the left-field corner at Petco Park. It was Hairston's fifth.	Greene's two-run shot into the seats in left-center made it 4-0 with two outs in the sixth. It was just the second homer for Greene, who came into the game hitting .207. Adrian Gonzalez was aboard on an RBI double.	Reynolds was the second pick overall in the 2006 draft. The Rockies purchased his contract before the game, but he'd known since earlier in the week that he was coming up. Reynolds was removed after two innings of his start for Colorado Springs on Wednesday and his teammates congratulated him on his impending callup.	Reynolds is from Pacifica, just south of San Francisco. He left about 25 tickets for family members, and said he heard friends calling out to him from the stands when he was warming up.	"The first two innings I stayed on top of the ball well and kept the ball down," he said. "The last couple of innings, I got a little bit lackadaisical mentally and left some balls up. The one to Greene is definitely an example of that."	He allowed four runs and six hits in 5 2/3 innings, struck out one and walked two.	"It was pretty much the way I had imagined it," Reynolds said of his debut.	"I think he just got some balls in some bad locations," manager Clint Hurdle said. "I thought it was a pretty good first effort. I thought he handled it very professional. I saw some good things."	Young started strong, allowing just three singles and one walk through six innings, and striking out five straight batters at one point.	He hit the wall in the seventh, though. He loaded the bases with no outs, allowing singles to Garrett Atkins and Brad Hawpe, and walking Ryan Spilborghs. Sidearmer Cla Meredith came on and got Chris Iannetta to hit into a double play that brought in Atkins, then struck out Clint Barmes to end the inning.	Young allowed one run and five hits in six innings, struck out seven and walked two.	San Diego's Kevin Kouzmanoff hit a two-out, bases-loaded RBI single in the seventh. Tadahito Iguchi doubled with two outs in the eighth to bring in rookie Luke Carlin, aboard on his first big league hit, a double into the right-field corner.	Game notes	 Carlin started the day game after catching Saturday night's game because Josh Bard got an injection in his surgically repaired right wrist. Black said Bard is expected back Monday night in Chicago. ... The Rockies made room for Reynolds by optioning Mark Redman to the Sky Sox. Redman lost his starting job after allowing 19 earned runs in 13 2/3 innings of his last three starts, including five runs in 2 2/3 innings in a 6-5 loss to St. Louis on Tuesday night. He was 2-3 with a 7.84. ... RHP Bryan Corey made his Padres debut, pitching the ninth after he was obtained earlier in the day from the Boston Red Sox for a player to be named or cash. To make room, the Padres optioned LHP Joe Thatcher to Triple-A Portland.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The guy who made the Giants by surprise came up with a most surprising home run against a pitcher who rarely surrenders them.	Steve Holm entered the game as a defensive replacement at catcher, then delivered the biggest hit of the day. His mom, Bobbie, was in the stands to see it, too.	Holm hit a go-ahead, two-run shot in the seventh inning for his first major league homer, and the San Francisco Giants held on for a 4-3 victory in the rubber game against the Philadelphia Phillies on Sunday.	"What I got was a fastball a little up. You're just going to try to be as aggressive as you can be when you come off the bench," said Holm, who emerged as San Francisco's backup catcher after Eliezer Alfonzo and Guillermo Rodriguez both struggled during spring training.	"I didn't know it was out until I hit second. I just kind of cruised in. You make sure you don't fall down or do anything stupid."	Holm homered in his first at-bat on the first pitch he saw from J.C. Romero (3-1) after replacing Bengie Molina in the top of the seventh, sending the ball into the seats in left-center. Romero had allowed only one homer in his previous 61 appearances and came in with an 0.63 ERA over his first 17 outings of 2008.	Holm -- who was greeted in the clubhouse with a couple of celebratory shaving cream pies to the face -- traded away a bat and helmet for the keepsake home run ball, which he planned to present to his mother.	"We'll see how good a mother she's been on Mother's Day," he said with a smile. "No, I'll probably give it to her."	Jack Taschner (2-0) pitched the seventh for the win, Tyler Walker worked a 1-2-3 eighth and Brian Wilson finished for his 11th save in 13 opportunities. San Francisco rallied for its first series win this month in three chances.	The Phillies went ahead 3-2 in the fifth when Pat Burrell hit a sacrifice fly after Ryan Howard's first triple of the year. Howard's hit drove in a run and chased San Francisco starter Jonathan Sanchez.	Phillies starter Adam Eaton drew a bases-loaded walk in the fourth to tie it at 1.	"We definitely are not hitting the ball," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said. "We've got to hit better than we've been doing to win."	The Giants snapped a season-long five-game losing streak with an 8-2 victory Saturday, then managed just enough offense Sunday. San Francisco hadn't won a series since beating the Rockies two out of three at home to end April, including dropping two of three in Philadelphia from May 2-4.	Reigning NL MVP Jimmy Rollins went 0-for-5 in his third game back from a disabled list stint with a sprained left ankle. He had three hits Friday in his return, missing the cycle by a triple.	The Bay Area native from nearby Alameda used a pink bat with his mom's name on it -- Gigi -- for Mother's Day and breast cancer awareness. She was once a standout middle infielder for the Allen Temple Baptist Church women's fast-pitch softball team in Oakland.	"My mom never made outs," Rollins said before the game.	Afterward, he retired the special bat.	"He said they didn't have any hits in them," Gigi Rollins said.	San Francisco's Ray Durham struck out as a pinch hitter to leave the bases loaded in the sixth, and the Giants missed several other scoring opportunities.	John Bowker singled in a run in the second to give San Francisco a 1-0 lead, but Jose Castillo followed by grounding into an inning-ending double play. The Giants hit into double plays again in the third, fourth and sixth innings -- Castillo doing so in the fourth and sixth.	Omar Vizquel was intentionally walked three times in the eighth hole to bring up the pitcher, but Durham pinch-hit in the sixth. That's after Vizquel got three hits in his season debut Saturday, when he returned following Feb. 27 arthroscopic surgery on his left knee.	The intentional free passes were the most by a Giant since indicted home run king Barry Bonds drew four against Houston on Sept. 22, 2004.	"I was kidding him that I thought he had 25 on his back," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said in a reference to Bonds' old uniform number.	Bochy doesn't plan to overextend the 41-year-old Vizquel, an 11-time Gold Glove shortstop. Vizquel likely will play three or four games at a time, then get a break for a day or two.	"That would be nice, to give me a little rest," said Vizquel, who typically dislikes days off.	San Francisco left-hander Barry Zito (0-7) will try again for his first victory of the season Monday when the Giants face Astros ace Roy Oswalt in the opener of a four-game series with Houston.

SEATTLE (AP) -- Raul Ibanez's long home run was the spark the Seattle Mariners needed.	Ibanez hit a two-run drive to right that traveled an estimated 443 feet and the Mariners beat the Chicago White Sox 6-3 Sunday to snap a five-game losing streak.	"When you hit one that far it puts some life in a ballclub," Seattle closer J.J. Putz said.	Jose Lopez and Ichiro Suzuki each went 3-for-4 for the Mariners, who finished with 13 hits. It was Seattle's most hits since it collected 10 in a 7-3 win over Texas last Monday. The Mariners went 2-5 on their seven-game homestand.	Seattle got to Gavin Floyd (3-2), who has been one of the toughest pitchers to hit so far this season, for five runs and nine hits over 3 2/3 innings.	Floyd entered with a major league-leading opponent batting average of .149. He carried a no-hitter into the ninth Tuesday against Minnesota and into the seventh April 12 against Detroit.	Trailing 2-0 in the first, the Mariners rallied to win for the first time this season when they trailed by more than one run.	"We have a good ballclub," manager John McLaren said. "Things haven't been going well, but I believe in these guys. We need to keep them going and get out of a hole."	Ibanez connected on a 3-0 pitch with two outs in the third for his sixth homer of the season. Ibanez's drive scored Suzuki, who was aboard after a single, and gave the Mariners a 3-2 lead.	"I don't know, but I hit that pretty good," Ibanez said when asked if he had ever hit a homer that far. "I know if it goes 326 feet it counts as one run."	Miguel Batista (3-4) went 5 1/3 innings for Seattle, allowing three runs and 10 hits. He struck out six and walked three on a season-high 115 pitches.	"We let him get off the hook," Chicago manager Ozzie Guillen said. "We only scored two when we had a chance to score more. He struck out big people making good pitches to get out of a jam and then all of a sudden he started to pitch better."	Putz worked the ninth for his first save since April 22 and third of the season. Putz walked Joe Crede with two outs before he struck out Nick Swisher.	Relievers Arthur Rhodes, Sean Green and Brandon Morrow combined for 2 2/3 innings of one-hit ball to get the ball to Putz.	Rhodes relieved Batista in the sixth and worked out of a bases-loaded jam. Morrow struck out Carlos Quentin and Jim Thome in the eighth with a runner on first.	"Miguel battled and let us line up the bullpen the way we wanted," Putz said. "Arthur gets out the big lefty [Thome] out, Green's been solid all year and so has Morrow."	Seattle took a 5-2 lead in the fourth on Yuniesky Betancourt's two-run double.	Guillen expects Floyd to bounce back from the rocky start.	"He struggled early in the game and put a lot of runners on base," Guillen said. "He's been good for us all year and he'll be back next start."	Ibanez said he had a feeling the Mariners offense might finally take off. They scored only seven runs during the five-game losing streak.	"We've seen a lot of hard outs the last couple of days and we've had a lot better sounds coming off the bat," Ibanez said. "We're definitely going to enjoy the moment. But now the moment's over and we need to start again tomorrow."	Chicago had a three-game winning streak snapped.	Game notes	 Chicago's Orlando Cabrera went 4-for-5 to tie a career high for hits. ... Chicago gave RF Jermaine Dye the day off. ... Suzuki stole his 16th base in the second.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Houston Astros had as much difficulty getting a hit against Hiroki Kuroda as the Los Angeles Dodgers' usually reliable bullpen did in getting outs.	Kuroda took a no-hitter into the seventh inning before the Astros broke through for seven hits and six runs in the eighth inning and pulled out an 8-5 victory Sunday.	"You go from being no-hit to getting eight runs. That just shows what kind of guys we have in this locker room," Houston manager Cecil Cooper said. "They keep playing hard and they don't quit. It's a tribute to them. We had some great at-bats."	Lance Berkman, Carlos Lee and Hunter Pence had RBI singles against reliever Jonathan Broxton (1-1), and Brad Ausmus added a two-run single against the right-hander as the Astros won for the eighth time in nine games. Houston also completed its first three-game sweep at Dodger Stadium since Sept. 25-27, 1992.	Michael Bourn capped the rally with a sacrifice fly, giving Houston a 7-3 lead. The Dodgers' bullpen came in with a 2.72 ERA, second-best in the majors.	"It's tough," catcher Russell Martin said. "A guy goes six innings and doesn't give up any hits, and you take him out after one hit and the bullpen gives it up for him. Everyone feels bad. You want to win every game you can when a guy throws his heart out like that."	Kuroda allowed a run and just one hit over 6 2/3 innings, struck out five, walked three and hit a batter in his eighth big league start after 11 seasons with Hiroshima of the Japanese Pacific League.	The right-hander remained winless in his last seven starts since his Dodgers debut on April 4, when he allowed a run and three hits over seven innings in a 7-1 win at San Diego.	Kuroda was bidding to become the second Japanese-born pitcher to throw a no-hitter in the majors. Hideo Nomo had one for Los Angeles on Sept. 17, 1996, beating the Colorado Rockies 9-0 at Coors Field. No Dodger has thrown a no-hitter since, but Nomo had another one April 4, 2001, at Baltimore in his Boston Red Sox debut.	"It wasn't that we were trying too hard. He was just making good pitches," Lee said. "He kept the ball down, moved it around and really kept us off-balance. We were just trying to get good at-bats and find a way to get on base."	The no-hit bid ended when Pence got a 2-1 slider he liked and slapped a clean single in the hole past third baseman Blake DeWitt with two outs in the seventh and the Dodgers leading 2-0 on James Loney's two-run homer in the first.	Pence's hit off Kuroda came with one of the pink bats teammate Miguel Tejada was using on Mother's Day in acknowledgment of the fight against breast cancer.	"He had three quality pitches that he didn't leave over the plate very often," said Pence, who was 3-for-4 with two RBIs. "He was keeping it on the corners and getting us to swing at bad ones with his deception. I was just looking to get a pitch over the plate and try to get the barrel on it."	Kuroda then walked Ty Wigginton and had a 1-0 count on pinch-hitter Geoff Blum before manager Joe Torre replaced him with lefty Joe Beimel.	"He was tired," Torre said. "There was a lot of emotion. When you are pitching a close game with a no-hitter on top of it, it takes a lot more out of you. We finally got a pitcher who pitched as well as Kuroda did today and it didn't stand up."	Geoff Geary (1-1) pitched one inning for the win, and Jose Valverde got the final out for his eighth save after Doug Brocail gave up two runs in the ninth.	Houston starter Shawn Chacon ended up with his eighth straight no-decision to start the season -- tying a major league record. He gave up two runs and seven hits in six innings and struck out three.	"I'm sitting there in the eighth inning and I'm thinking I'm stuck on a pretty tough 'L' here," Chacon said. "But there's no quit in this team. Our offense is too good."	The nine-year veteran, in his first season with the Astros, joined left-hander Dick Stigman of the 1965 Minnesota Twins as the only pitchers to have no-decisions in their first eight starts of a season.	"It's pretty weird," Chacon said. "Someone told me that I tied a major league record. I don't know how excited I am about it, but I can't do anything but keep trying to pitch well and keep our team in the game. If the relievers get all my wins, fine. They can take them. But I definitely want to get a win before I get a loss."	The Dodgers have dropped four straight after winning 10 of 11.	Game notes	 Tejada was hit by a pitch for the second consecutive day, after getting plunked only once in 154 plate appearances over his previous 36 games this season. ... The Dodgers next play Milwaukee, and will get a look at old pal Eric Gagne for the first time since he left the organization at the end of the 2006 season. Gagne set a major league record with 84 consecutive save conversions for them and won a Cy Young award in 2003. Gagne was demoted from his closer role Sunday after blowing five of his first 14 save opportunities.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Joe Nathan wiped the sweat from his forehead and spoke breathlessly about his latest, and most harrowing, save of the season.	Minnesota's normally unhittable closer usually makes things look so easy when he steps to the mound to blow away another overmatched opponent. But the heavy-hitting Boston Red Sox never go quietly, and Sunday night was a prime example.	"Tonight was probably seven appearances in one," Nathan said after allowing two runs in the ninth and winning a showdown with pinch-hitter Manny Ramirez to clinch the Twins' 9-8 victory over the Sox.	Craig Monroe went 2-for-4 with two of light-hitting Minnesota's three home runs and four RBIs, and Nathan made a stellar defensive play in the ninth that may have saved the game.	He took the mound with a 9-6 lead, but gave up an RBI double to J.D. Drew to make the score 9-7 with runners on second and third and one out.	Coco Crisp then lined a pitch off Nathan's glove, and the former shortstop had to chase it down as it rolled toward third base. He picked it up and threw to Mike Lamb to get Drew at third for the second out.	"Joe [Mauer]] came out and said, 'Nice play, but this thing ain't done yet. We still got one more to go,'" Nathan said. "Then I stared into the on-deck circle to find out who was coming up."	Manny.	After spending the first eight innings on the bench resting a sore hamstring, Ramirez and his 497 career home runs stepped out of the dugout to wild cheers from a hearty contingent of Red Sox fans.	Boston manager Terry Francona really had no choice. His team had come back from deficits of 5-0 and 7-1, after an atypically brutal start from Tim Wakefield (3-2) at the Metrodome.	"I had qualms," Francona said. "But to come that far back, [he's] a pretty good hitter to not have hit."	Crisp stole second base early in the count to put the tying run in scoring position.	"I just told myself, 'Try and make some pitches,'" Nathan said. "I definitely wanted to make sure I was still careful. I really wanted to be aggressive, but make good pitches."	He ran a two-seam fastball in on Ramirez's hands, and he grounded out to shortstop Adam Everett to end the game and fall to 0-for-7 with five strikeouts lifetime against Nathan.	"It goes to show that even three-run leads aren't a lock," Nathan said. "You have to go out there, you have to work and get your three outs. This thing's not over until you do, especially against a club like this."	It sure seemed like it was over long before after a power surge by the small-ball Twins, who entered with a major league-low 17 homers and had yet to hit more than one in a game before Sunday's binge.	Wakefield's knuckleball always seems to bite a little bit harder in the Dome, with the 41-year-old entering 7-3 with a 3.95 ERA in his career under the puffy white roof.	But he gave up seven runs -- six earned -- on seven hits in just 2 2/3 innings on Sunday, the earliest he's been knocked out of a start since June 20, 1997, at Detroit, when he lasted just 2 1/3 innings.	Wakefield twice lasted only 2 innings since, but one was a tuneup before the playoffs started on Sept. 28, 2003. The other was at Milwaukee on June 6, 2003, when he was hit by a pitch on the ankle in the third inning and taken out of the game.	"I felt great. I thought I had good stuff," Wakefield said. "It's one of those nights you'd like to forget."	Monroe had a three-run homer and Everett a two-run shot in the second inning for a 5-0 lead.	Crisp hit his second homer in as many days to go with a triple and three RBIs, and Alex Cora had three hits in his first game back from the disabled list.	But Nick Blackburn (3-2) struck out five in six shaky innings and Monroe improved to .333 (7-for-21) with three homers in his career against Wakefield.	"I think about being in the backyard playing whiffle ball," Monroe said. "I just say, 'Forget mechanics. Don't worry about that. Just try to catch this thing out front.'	"I've had some success, so I'm just going to continue to try to think the same thing."	Game notes	 Timlin's appearance was his 1,023rd, moving him past Lee Smith and Jose Mesa for eighth on the career list. ... As part of Mother's Day, the Twins hosted 12 mothers or grandmothers of players Sunday. Jan Guerrier, mother of Matt Guerrier, threw out the first pitch. Jan Guerrier was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2001, but it has been in remission since 2006. ... Ellsbury was hit on the inside of his left knee while squaring around to bunt in the third, but remained in the game.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

PITTSBURGH -- Maybe it's no coincidence the Pittsburgh Pirates developed some consistency when Freddy Sanchez and Zach Duke did.	Sanchez's three-run double in the fifth inning put Pittsburgh ahead, leading Duke and the streaking Pirates past the Atlanta Braves 5-0 Monday in the first game of a doubleheader.	Duke (2-2) shook off five walks and three errors behind him to limit Atlanta to five hits over six innings, and the Pirates won their sixth in a row -- their longest winning streak since taking 10 consecutive games from June 25-July 5, 2004.	The Braves lost their seventh straight on the road. They have the majors' best home record (14-4) and worst road mark (4-14).	Atlanta has lost three in a row in Pittsburgh after sweeping a six-game homestand against the Reds and Padres.	"I have no clue while we struggle on the road," Braves rookie starter Jair Jurrjens said. "It's a crazy thing a team goes through during a season and I hope we snap out of it quick, because we need to win some games on the road. Something on the road just doesn't click with us right now."	What is clicking for the Pirates is their starting pitching, which is 4-0 with a 2.29 ERA during the winning streak. Duke was constantly in trouble, with at least two runners reaching in all but one inning, but he got key outs when he needed them while stranding 10 runners.	"The big key was most of the runners came when we had two outs already, so you can focus on getting that one out. It made it a little easier," Duke said.	The Braves left 15 on overall while being shut out on eight hits by Duke, Damaso Marte and Sean Burnett. Duke has pitched well over three consecutive starts, allowing five runs in 20 1/3 innings.	"Zach's keeping the ball down, using his sinker and he's getting a lot more ground balls," manager John Russell said. "He's going to give up some hits, but he attacks the zone down with his sinker, mixes in some off-speed pitches, and makes them hit it on the ground."	Duke hadn't won since June 12, a span of 12 outings over two seasons, until beating the Giants 12-6 by allowing three runs over 7 1/3 innings on Tuesday. The left-hander hadn't won successive starts since beating the Brewers and Mets, respectively, on Sept. 11 and 17, 2006, but has allowed three runs or fewer in six of eight starts this season.	Jurrjens (4-3) got himself into trouble in the fifth by walking Jason Michaels and hitting light-hitting rookie Brian Bixler with a pitch in the upper back, helping the Pirates load the bases.	After Duke struck out, Sanchez -- 10-for-24 (.417) with eight RBIs as a leadoff batter since moving up one spot in the order last week -- cleared the bases with a double to right-center.	"I don't think it makes any difference where he hits," Duke said. "He's steady Freddy, that's what he does."	Jurrjens said, "The pitch, I thought, was a good pitch, a two-seam fastball outside, but he's a good hitter and he hit it for a double. It cost us the game."	Adam LaRoche added a two-run homer, his fourth, following Ryan Doumit's leadoff double in the eighth against Manny Acosta.	Game notes	Braves 1B Mark Teixeira left in the fourth inning with back spasms on a cloudy, chilly 48-degree day. ... Pirates RF Xavier Nady didn't start for the first time since April 11. ... The doubleheader resulted from a rainout Sunday. ... Pittsburgh leads the season series 5-1. ... The Pirates have won their last seven in PNC Park and are 12-7 at home. ... Pittsburgh had gone 53 innings and six games without making an error until committing three in the first five innings. ... Braves reliever Jeff Bennett hit Michaels in the sixth with an inside pitch that popped open the top three buttons of Michaels' jersey. ... Atlanta's Gregor Blanco reached base four times on two singles and two walks.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Tim Hudson showed again that a well-pitched game is the easiest and best way to end an extended streak. Or, on this day, a number of streaks.	Hudson limited Pittsburgh to two hits and an unearned run over seven innings and the Atlanta Braves halted their seven-game road losing slide with an 8-1 victory that concluded Monday's doubleheader.	In the opener, Freddy Sanchez hit a three-run double and Zach Duke pitched six shutout innings as the Pirates won 5-0 for their sixth consecutive win.	With Mark Kotsay and Brian McCann driving in three runs each, Atlanta avoided its first four-game sweep by Pittsburgh since Sept. 1-3, 1978. The Pirates' winning streak was their longest since they won 10 straight from June 25-July 5, 2004.	"We were able to get a nice lead and I was able to relax," Hudson said after winning his third in a row, all with dominating outings. "I did a pretty good job of changing speeds off my fastball. When you get a lead, you can experiment a little bit."	Hudson (6-2) held the Pirates to a lone single over his final six innings, finishing with five strikeouts and two walks. Pittsburgh's only run came in the first on first baseman Greg Norton's error on Nate McLouth's grounder.	Hudson has permitted only two earned runs and 11 hits over 23 innings in beating the Reds, Padres and Pirates in succession, averaging nearly eight innings per start.	"He's a guy who's been doing it well for a long time. We had a chance to get more runs early and didn't do it," the Pirates' Adam LaRoche said. "But other than this game, it was a great 6-1 homestand for us. We finally put it all together."	So did the Braves in the second game as they took a 3-1 lead on Kotsay's two-run double in the fourth against John Van Benschoten (0-2). McCann's three-run homer in the fifth made it 7-1. Kotsay added an RBI double in the seventh.	The Braves still own the majors' worst road record, 5-14, but finally ended a road losing streak that extended over their last two road trips. They also stopped Pittsburgh's seven-game home winning streak.	Even while splitting, the Braves left 24 on base, 15 in the opener as Duke (2-2) shook off five walks, three errors and five Braves hits to win. Duke, Damaso Marte and Sean Burnett combined to pitch the shutout.	"I think we're playing great," manager Bobby Cox said. "We hit so many balls hard with men on, it's becoming a joke around the clubhouse. Line drives right at them. It's crazy."	Van Benschoten, one of the majors' worst starters last season with an 0-7 record and a 10.15 ERA in nine starts, wasn't much better in his first 2008 start. The 2001 first-round draft pick was roughed up for seven runs, six earned, and nine hits over four-plus innings.	"We were able to time up his fastball and put some good swings on it," Jeff Francoeur said.	The right-handed Van Benschoten has a 1-12 record and 8.84 ERA in 21 career major league games and hasn't won since 2004, and likely won't get a chance to win again soon. He was optioned back to Triple-A Indianapolis after the game.	"I'll be back," he said. "It's the business, the nature of the beast, and I've got to rise up from this."	Still, he might be running out of chances after giving up eight earned runs in 7 2/3 innings and losing twice in four games following his April 29 callup. The Pirates will make a roster move to replace him Tuesday in St. Louis.	Duke was constantly in trouble, with at least two runners reaching in all but one inning, but got key outs when he needed them. He won successive starts for the first time since beating the Brewers on Sept. 11, 2006, and the Mets six days later.	"The big key was most of the runners came when we had two outs already, so you can focus on getting that one out. It made it a little easier," Duke said.	Braves rookie Jair Jurrjens (4-3) got himself into trouble in the fifth by walking Jason Michaels and hitting light-hitting rookie Brian Bixler with a pitch in the upper back, helping the Pirates load the bases.	Sanchez -- 10-for-28 (.357) with eight RBIs as a leadoff batter since moving up one spot in the order last week -- cleared the bases with a two-out double to right-center. LaRoche added a two-run homer, his fourth, in the eighth against Manny Acosta.	Game notes	 The Pirates went into the doubleheader with a six-game errorless streak, only to commit six errors -- all but one by infielders. ... Hudson lost his previous two road starts, pitching only three innings in each. ... Braves 1B Mark Teixeira left in the fourth inning of the opener with back spasms on a cloudy, chilly 48-degree day. He didn't play in the second game. ... Pittsburgh won the season series 5-2. ... By losing the second game, Pittsburgh -- coming off 15 consecutive losing seasons -- missed a chance to reach .500.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CLEVELAND (AP) -- Fausto Carmona gave Cliff Lee a tough act to follow.	Carmona pitched a five-hitter for Cleveland's second consecutive shutout over the struggling Toronto Blue Jays, a 3-0 victory in Monday's doubleheader opener.	Lee, 6-0 with a major league-leading 0.81 ERA, started the second game and tried to complete a sweep for the Indians.	"Fausto was fantastic," Indians manager Eric Wedge said. "He got better as the game went on -- noticeably better."	Carmona (4-1) struck out three and walked four in his second shutout and third complete game in 47 big league starts. The right-hander was 9 months old the previous time Cleveland pitched consecutive shutouts at home, on Sept. 8-9, 1982, against Boston and Baltimore.	It had been 36 years since the Indians did it in Cleveland against the same opponent, blanking the Chicago White Sox on May 6-7, 1972.	"We know our starting pitching is extremely strong," said David Dellucci, whose two-out single in the sixth drove in the first run. "The way Fausto was pitching, we knew it wouldn't take a lot."	A.J. Burnett (3-4) gave up three runs and five hits in 7 2/3 innings for the Blue Jays, who have been blanked in 22 consecutive innings.	"It's tough, but that's the way it has been going," Toronto manager John Gibbons said. "Carmona was great. He can do that to you."	Cleveland won for the fifth time in six games and extended the Blue Jays' losing streak to four. The Indians outscored Toronto 21-1 in the first three games of the series, and the Blue Jays have lost nine straight games in Cleveland.	Shaun Marcum started for Toronto in the second game. Sunday's rainout caused the first single-admission doubleheader at Cleveland since Aug. 13, 1997.	Burnett allowed only one hit until Grady Sizemore doubled off the wall in right-center with one out in the sixth. Sizemore went to third on a groundout by Jamey Carroll and scored on Dellucci's single.	"That's a big two-out knock in a zero-zero ball game," Wedge said.	Travis Hafner drew a leadoff walk in the seventh and Asdrubal Cabrera followed with his first homer since Sept. 17.	Cleveland's defense helped Carmona. In the second, Cabrera ranged behind second base to field a sharp grounder, shoveled the ball with his glove to second baseman Jamey Carroll, who turned the double play.	With Scott Rolen on first and one out in the fourth, Matt Stairs lined a single to right and Ben Francisco made a one-hop throw to third baseman Casey Blake to retire Rolen.	With two on and two outs in the seventh, first baseman Ryan Garko made a diving backhand stop of a sharp grounder hit by Joe Inglett, then flipped to Carmona covering for the inning-ending out.	Game notes	 Burnett dropped to 30-34 with a 4.31 ERA when starting with more than four days' rest. He's 42-36 with a 3.43 ERA when starting on normal rest. ... Stairs had three of Toronto's hits. ... Carmona fanned Aaron Hill three times -- Carmona's only strikeouts. ... Burnett is 1-4 in five starts against the Indians, including 0-4 in Cleveland. ... Indians OF Shin-Soo Choo, recovering from elbow surgery last September, is expected to begin a rehab assignment this week at Triple-A Buffalo.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Minutes into the game, Livan Hernandez and the Minnesota Twins watched another ball sail over the wall for the other side.	Boston's Manny Ramirez made it a league-most 42 home runs allowed by the Twins, who just shrugged off the early deficit and went back to playing the way they always have.	Hernandez won again, Craig Monroe contributed another big hit, and the Twins beat the Red Sox 7-3 to win the four-game series and improve to 14-7 at home.	"There may be new characters in the clubhouse, but it's the same philosophy," said Michael Cuddyer, who had two hits and knocked one in.	Ramirez hit career homer No. 498 in that first inning, a two-run shot that gave him only his second home run in 20 games and gave the Red Sox a 3-0 lead.	But Hernandez (6-1) rebounded after that rough start to finish six innings for another quality outing, and the Twins are now 8-1 when he's on the mound.	"Maybe they don't got the power like the other teams, but it's a good-hitting team," Hernandez said. "You've got to concentrate on something to try to stay long in the game. I kept thinking all the time that three runs is not going to make a difference."	Red Sox starter Clay Buchholz (2-3) didn't make it out of the fifth, done in by control problems and timely hits by the Twins -- who took three games and reduced the Red Sox lead in the AL East to a half-game over Tampa Bay. That's their smallest since May 1.	"It's tough, but you have to give the Twins credit," Ramirez said. "They have a great bullpen that pitched great, and you have to tip your hat to them."	Juan Rincon pitched two hitless innings, and Jesse Crain got Ramirez to fly out to center field to end a scoreless ninth. Minnesota has won nine of its last 12 games and scored 74 runs in the process.	"Everybody's starting to swing the bats, and it'll be fun around here when we start to see everyone get going," said Monroe, who hit a two-run double in the decisive three-run fifth.	The Twins have done it almost entirely with singles, speed and smart baserunning. Their 20 homers rank one ahead of Kansas City for the fewest in the majors, and they beat up Buchholz for seven runs in 4 1/3 innings with only one extra-base hit.	Monroe, who hit two homers in Sunday's 9-8 win, has so far been a pleasantly productive part-time DH for the Twins. Monroe, acquired from the Cubs for minor league outfielder Doug Deeds, is batting .290.	Hernandez, another unheralded acquisition during a hectic winter, has been a huge help for the first-place Twins. Minnesota has won all three of his starts this month by a combined 31-5 score, and he has allowed only five runs in 22 innings.	"He changed his speed a lot, with good location," Ramirez said. "When he's on, he's on, and he pitched great. You have to give him credit."	Over his last two starts, Buchholz has surrendered 18 hits and 12 runs in just 8 1/3 innings. He walked five this time, twice putting Mauer on to lead off an inning and watching him come all the way around.	"I don't know what anybody can tell me," Buchholz said. "It's sort of in my hands right now. I was leaving pitches up, and they got hit. That's what happens."	Just about everything fell Minnesota's way in this series, good vibes no more evident than in the top of the seventh inning when Dustin Pedroia hit a routine line drive to right field straight at Cuddyer.	He casually reached for it, when the ball popped out of his glove, bounced on the top of his cap, off the brim and back into the mitt. Cuddyer mouthed a "wow" and flashed a sheepish smile.	"It was definitely not a trick," said Cuddyer, an accomplished magician.	Game notes	 The Twins will take their time with RH Scott Baker, who was placed on the DL last week due to a problematic right groin strain and essentially replaced in the rotation by LH Glen Perkins. Manager Ron Gardenhire said Baker won't be allowed to throw full speed off a mound for at least another 10 to 12 days. ... The Red Sox released LH Abe Alvarez to make room on Triple-A Pawtucket's roster for IF Jed Lowrie, who was sent down Sunday. Alvarez was a second-round draft pick in 2003 who made brief appearances with Boston in 2004, 2005 and 2006, but was sidetracked the last two seasons by ankle and oblique injuries. ... Twins LF Delmon Young twisted his left ankle in the eighth inning, but was determined to stay in the game. He has played in 202 consecutive games, but Gardenhire said he should be fine to play Tuesday pending evaluation. "It's up to me when I come back," Young said. "It's my body, so if I can play on it then I can play." ... J.D. Drew had his third three-hit game of the season for Boston and raised his average to .301.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CLEVELAND (AP) -- Asdrubal Cabrera delivered a home run in the first game of a doubleheader Monday and the 14th unassisted triple play in major-league history in the nightcap.	The drive helped Cleveland win 3-0. The fielding gem wasn't enough to complete the sweep.	"It's a triple play but I'm not going to talk about it; we didn't win the game," Indians manager Eric Wedge said.	Shannon Stewart hit a sacrifice fly in the 10th inning, Aaron Hill added a two-run single and the Toronto Blue Jays beat Cleveland 3-0 on Monday night to salvage a split of the doubleheader.	"It's nice to get one with nothing else going our way," Hill said after Toronto snapped a 31-inning scoreless streak and won for just the second time in seven games.	The nightcap featured terrific pitching by Toronto's Shaun Marcum and Cleveland's Cliff Lee, who got a big assist from Cabrera in the fifth inning.	With Kevin Mench and Marco Scutaro on with singles and running on the 1-0 pitch, Cabrera made a diving backhand catch of a line drive by Lyle Overbay, touched second base to force Mench and then tagged out Scutaro.	The only miscue by the 22-year-old Cabrera was that he didn't keep the ball.	"He flipped it into the stands and right as he did cried out, 'Oh, no!'" first-base coach Luis Rivera said, serving as the Venezuelan's interpreter.	"I knew it was pretty special," Cabrera said.	Colorado shortstop Troy Tulowitzki made the last unassisted triple play in the majors, on April 29, 2007, against Atlanta. Oakland second baseman Randy Velarde last turned the trick in the AL, on May 29, 2000, against the Yankees.	This was the record third unassisted triple play by a Cleveland fielder.	Indians shortstop Neal Ball made the first one in history, in 1909. Cleveland second baseman Bill Wambsganss turned the only one in the World Series, in 1920 during a Game 5 win over Brooklyn.	The Indians have also been victimized three such times. The last player to pull an unassisted triple play against them -- Ron Hansen, in 1968 for Washington -- is now an advance scout for Philadelphia and was at Progressive Field to see Cabrera's feat.	"That was pretty neat," said Lee, who pitched nine scoreless innings to lower his ERA to 0.67 but failed to improve on his 6-0 record. "It doesn't matter now, though. The bottom line is we've got to win."	Lee got even more defense in the top of the ninth from first baseman Victor Martinez and right fielder Franklin Gutierrez.	With one out and Stewart on second, Martinez, ordinarly a catcher, leaped to snare a line drive off the bat of Alex Rios. After an infield single by Scott Rolen sent Stewart to third, Mench lined an 0-2 pitch into the right-center gap. Gutierrez raced over and caught it with a dive to keep it scoreless.	"We made multiple plays on defense but didn't do anything on offense," Wedge said after Cleveland totaled eight hits in the two games -- just three in the second game.	"Our approach was about as poor if not the poorest I've seen all year," Wedge said. "There's no excuse for it. Not to take anything away from [Marcum], he's a fine pitcher, but we gave away at-bats all night."	Fausto Carmona (4-1) pitched a five-hitter and Cabrera hit a two-run homer in Cleveland's 3-0 victory in the first game.	According to the Elias Sports Bureau, the last time a team had both pitchers throw nine scoreless innings in a doubleheader was Boston on Sept. 5, 1977, when Don Aase and Reggie Cleveland both won in Toronto.	Marcum allowed two hits in eight innings, striking out five without a walk to match Lee pitch-for-pitch. Lee yielded seven hits, walked two and struck out five.	B.J. Ryan (1-0) worked a scoreless ninth for the win and Scott Downs pitched the 10th for his fourth save.	Matt Stairs singled to open the Toronto 10th and took second on Overbay's infield single on a ball that glanced off Rafael Betancourt's left elbow and ricocheted into foul ground.	Betancourt (1-2) was examined by trainers and stayed in the game to face Gregg Zaun, who bunted over both runners. Pinch-hitter Brad Wilkerson was intentionally walked to load the bases for Stewart, whose fly ball to center easily scored Stairs. Hill's single to center made it 3-0.	Toronto snapped a four-game losing streak.	Game notes	 Toronto fell two innings short of its longest scoreless streak of 33 innings, May 12-16, 1981. That streak included a perfect game by the Indians' Len Barker on May 15. ... Indians outfielder Shin-Soo Choo, recovering from elbow surgery last September, is expected to begin a rehab assignment this week at Triple-A Buffalo. ... According to the Elias Sports Bureau, the last team to have two pitchers go nine innings in both ends of a doubleheader was the Milwaukee Brewers on Aug. 13, 1993. Angel Miranda and Ricky Bones each allowed one run in nine innings.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CINCINNATI (AP) -- All those runs looked mighty good to Aaron Harang.	Jeff Keppinger and Brandon Phillips hit two-run homers in the seventh inning Monday night, breaking open a tied game and sending Harang to a long-awaited victory, 8-7 over the surging Florida Marlins.	The Reds' wildly inconsistent offense finally came through for its No. 1 starter.	Harang (2-5) hadn't won since April 10 despite one solid performance after another. The Reds scored two runs or less in half of his first eight starts, the main reason that ugly record accompanies his 3.32 ERA.	"I never lost faith," Harang said. "I know we can score runs. It just seemed like a dry spell. We put it together one day and not the next, and they seemed to fall on my days. They kept coming around and saying, 'Don't worry. We'll put some runs together. Just keep doing what you're doing.'"	The Marlins arrived with a seven-game winning streak and the best record in the majors. Things looked good early, when they piled up three solo homers off Harang, including another by Dan Uggla.	Keppinger, the Reds' most consistent hitter, snapped a 4-all tie with his homer off Taylor Tankersley (0-1), who came in to start the seventh. Phillips also connected for his seventh homer, providing two more runs that turned out to be just enough.	The Reds hadn't scored more than five runs in any game behind Harang, who gave up four runs and seven hits in seven innings before turning his rare lead over to the bullpen. It nearly slipped away in a wacky eighth inning.	"This game's crazy," Phillips said. "Just when you think things are looking up, crazy things happen."	After Luis Gonzalez singled home a run in the eighth, cutting it to 8-5, closer Francisco Cordero came on and hit Wes Helms to load the bases with two outs. Ken Griffey Jr. dropped Mike Rabelo's fly ball to shallow right field for an error that let in two more runs.	"I've never seen him do it before," manager Dusty Baker said. "That's a first for me. It shows it can happen to anybody. He's as sure-handed a man as you're going to find."	A walk loaded the bases again, raising the Reds' tension level. Griffey bobbled Alfredo Amezaga's fly to the warning track before grabbing it with his bare hand for the last out of the inning.	"The ball hit off his [glove] heel and he had the concentration to catch it," Gonzalez said. "Other outfielders don't make that play when the ball hits the heel, but Griffey is Griffey."	Cordero pitched a perfect ninth for his sixth save in as many chances. The Reds are the only team in the majors without a blown save.	The homer has figured prominently in the best start in Marlins history. Harang already knew what the Marlins could do -- he gave up five homers in his last two starts against them.	Make it eight homers in his last three.	Jeremy Hermida and Hanley Ramirez hit back-to-back homers in the first inning, and Uggla connected in the fourth for a 3-0 lead. It was Uggla's fourth homer in his last three games -- one was a grand slam -- and his eighth in 10 games.	Uggla has 12 homers overall after hitting a career-high 31 last season.	Right-hander Burke Badenhop gave up four runs in six innings, leaving with the score tied at 4. A throwing error by third baseman Jorge Cantu let in a run in the fifth, and Badenhop's wild pitch let in another with Harang at the plate and two outs in the sixth.	"Very frustrating," Badenhop said. "You get in that situation, and you completely yank a fastball [into the dirt]. Very disappointing."	Game notes	 Florida OF Josh Willingham hit soft-toss pitches Monday. Willingham, sidelined by a sore back, is eligible to come off the 15-day DL during the series in Cincinnati, but his return is uncertain. ... RH Bronson Arroyo will start Wednesday for the Reds, going on three days' rest to get the rotation back in order. Arroyo is 1-0 with a 3.05 ERA in three career starts on short rest. ... Slumping OF Adam Dunn was dropped to seventh in the order for the first time since July 8, 2005. He went 0-for-3 with a sacrifice fly.

NEW YORK (AP) -- Odalis Perez trudged off the mound without a hint of a smile, taking a slow walk to the Washington dugout and blowing into his cold hands. Not the typical body language one would expect from a pitcher who was about to earn his first win of the season.	Well, this wasn't a typical start for Perez.	Perez had three hits and two RBIs and pitched laboriously into the seventh inning, leading the Washington Nationals over the New York Mets 10-4 on Monday night for his first win in nine starts.	"It wasn't the best way to get it. It was a struggle," Perez said. "It wasn't easy in those early innings. I wasn't making a lot of good pitches but the offense was helping me, and even me helping myself."	On an unusually chilly night with winds gusting to more than 20 mph, Jesus Flores and Lastings Milledge each had two-run doubles and Washington ended a three-game slide by first taking advantage of Nelson Figueroa's wildness, then doing something they haven't been able to all season: get hits with runners on base.	"We know, ordinarily, Nelson has pretty good control. Our guys didn't chase, especially those sliders just off the plate," Washington manager Manny Acta said. "He wasn't throwing enough strikes and we were able to take advantage."	The Nationals came in hitting a major league-worst .237 with men on base and scored their first six runs on just five hits -- and five walks, two hit batters and two errors. They scored their first three runs on a sacrifice fly, bases-loaded walk and a throwing error by Figueroa (2-3), who was attempting to make a play at the plate on Felipe Lopez's tapper to the mound in the third.	After getting the third out of the third inning, Figueroa turned toward the Nationals dugout and made a mock clapping gesture into his glove in response to what he perceived was the Washington bench's rhythmic clapping for his walk and error during the inning.	Figueroa was not happy afterward.	"They were cheering in the dugout like a bunch of softball girls," he said. "I am a professional, I take great offense to that. ... They won tonight, but in the long run, look who they are, a last-place team."	Milledge defended his teammates: "We didn't try to rattle him. We're trying to get our guys going."	Lopez, on the other hand, dismissed Figueroa's complaints.	"If he's worried about the dugout, he should be worried about the catcher," he said. "We won because we got in his head."	In the fifth and sixth innings, the Nationals got five run-scoring hits when they scored seven runs to open a 10-3 lead.	Making his 200th career start, Perez (1-3) gave up a season-high 11 hits and four runs -- more than two runs for just the third time -- but Washington scored at least four runs in one of his starts for just the second time this year.	Perez led off the third with a single and scored on a bases-loaded walk, and had RBI singles in the fifth and sixth, when Washington batted around for four runs off reliever Jorge Sosa. His sacrifice in the third put runners on second and third before Figueroa made his throwing error. He finished 3-for-3.	"I was lucky," Perez said. "I saw three, like, cookies in the middle of the plate and I swung."	Perez left with one out in the seventh after giving up David Wright's seventh homer and Carlos Beltran's single. He struck out five and walked three.	Before the game, Mets manager Willie Randolph praised the Mets as looking "hitterish," and they did, getting at least 11 hits -- 12 Monday -- for the fifth time in six games, but they left 11 runners on base.	"[We] just have to do a better job capitalizing," on the hits, Randolph said.	Damion Easley homered to center in the second, his first since Aug. 18 at Washington. He was filling in for Luis Castillo, who strained his left quadriceps running out a triple Sunday. Castillo is day to day. Easley added an RBI single in the third to give New York a 3-2 lead.	Figueroa gave up six runs -- four earned -- and five hits in five innings. He struck out four.	"Walk to this guy, that guy and the other guy ... it was a very frustrating night," Figueroa said.	Game notes	 Randolph was noncommittal on whether he would alter his rotation so ace Johan Santana could start Friday at Yankee Stadium in the opener of the weekend Subway Series. The way the rotation is set up now, Santana is set to start Thursday against the Nationals and Mike Pelfrey against the Yankees on Friday. ... Mets reliever Matt Wise returned to Florida to get in more work before he is activated from the disabled list. On the DL since April 2 with a bruised right arm, Wise joined the team in New York on Friday but was never activated. ... Nats 1B Nick Johnson scored three runs. ... Washington scored 10 or more runs for the third time this season.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Count Derek Jeter among those who are impressed with the improving Tampa Bay Rays.	"They're playing well," the New York captain said Monday night after the Rays beat the Yankees 7-1 for their fifth consecutive victory, pulling within a half-game of first-place Boston in the AL East.	"The biggest difference with them is it looks like they've got a lot more confidence. You used to play in the past, I'm talking about a few years ago, and it looked like they waited for something to go wrong," Jeter added. "Now it seems like they have a lot of confidence, and it starts with their pitching."	Matt Garza pitched seven scoreless innings, allowing five hits, walking one and striking out three while holding the Yankees in check with help from three double plays. Only one baserunner, Alberto Gonzalez in the sixth, reached as far as second base against the right-hander.	Jason Bartlett and Dioner Navarro each drove in two runs for the Rays (22-16), who climbed six games over .500 for the first time in franchise history and also extended their home winning streak to a club-record 10 games.	And they it by beating nemesis Andy Pettitte (3-4), who was 8-1 at Tropicana Field before giving up five runs and eight hits in four innings.	Although the Yankees left-hander still is an impressive 14-4 lifetime against Tampa Bay, the Rays have won two of three matchups against him this season.	"I didn't think there was a difference on his end," said Rays designated hitter Jonny Gomes, who had two hits, one RBI and a pair of stolen bases. "I think it was on our end."	Gonzalez had two of New York's hits off Garza, who has won two of three starts since returning from a two-week stay on the disabled list with radial nerve irritation in his pitching arm. Jeter, Robinson Cano and Melky Cabrera had the others.	"The game plan was to attack," Garza said. "We went right after them."	Tampa Bay, coming off a weekend sweep of the Los Angeles Angels, lost its bid for a third shutout in four games in the eighth inning.	Jose Molina doubled, leading off the inning against Gary Glover, and later scored when Johnny Damon grounded to first base.	"Bottom line, we didn't hit tonight," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "This is a team that if you get ahead of them, they can't be as aggressive. If you get a lead on them, sometimes you can shut a little bit of that down."	On a day the Yankees learned they'll be without Alex Rodriguez for at least another week, Pettitte struggled against a division rival he's dominated for much of his career, especially at Tropicana Field.	The left-hander had won seven straight decisions in the domed stadium, dating to his only previous loss here on Sept. 16, 1998. The .888 career winning percentage he carried into Monday night was the second-best in the Rays' home behind Tim Wakefield's .900 (9-1).	Tampa Bay beat Pettitte 6-3 at Yankee Stadium on April 5, then 10 days later lost to him 5-3 at the Trop.	The Rays sandwiched two bloop singles to center around Gomes' first stolen base of the night to take a 1-0 lead in the second. They scored four more in the fourth on Bartlett's triple and RBI singles by Gomes and Akinori Iwamura.	"It's just pathetic on my part," said Pettitte, who has lost three straight decisions over four starts.	"A loss bothers me. I won't sleep. It doesn't matter if I got whacked around or had a bad inning," he added. "I lost the game. I didn't do my job, and I'm not going to rest real good for the next few days."	Navarro's run-scoring single off Chris Britton made it 6-0 in the fifth and ended a streak of 15 consecutive scoreless innings by New York's bullpen.	Rodriguez, who hasn't played since April 28 because of a strained right quadriceps, had an MRI exam that showed he's not ready to rejoin the Yankees for this weekend's series against the crosstown Mets.	The three-time AL MVP worked out at the Yankees' minor league complex in Tampa before making the 30-minute trip to St. Petersburg to watch the game from the dugout.	Game notes	 Iwamura extended his hitting streak to 10 games for Tampa Bay. ... Yankees C Jorge Posada, rehabbing at the team's minor league complex in Tampa, threw for the first time since going on the 15-day disabled list April 28 with right rotator cuff tendinitis. ... Rays INF Ben Zobrist had the pins removed from his broken left thumb and was activated from the DL after the game. INF Andy Cannizaro was designated for assignment.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The St. Louis Cardinals have seen just about enough of Milwaukee Brewers slugger Ryan Braun over the past two days.	Catcher Yadier Molina and manager Tony La Russa managed to see a few innings less of him than everyone else Monday night.	Braun hit two home runs for the second game in a row, and Molina and La Russa were ejected for arguing balls and strikes shortly after the second of Braun's two blasts in the Milwaukee Brewers' 8-3 victory.	For Braun, it was another sign that he's beginning to regain the form that made him NL Rookie of the Year last season.	"I feel the game slow down a little bit," Braun said. "I feel like I see pitches longer -- and bigger."	Braun followed up Sunday's two-homer performance by hitting two more off stingy Cardinals starter Adam Wainwright (3-2), who had given up four runs or less in his first seven starts and had a 2.25 ERA going into the game.	"The thing about him is if you make tough pitches, you hold him to singles or you get him out," Wainwright said. "You make bad pitches, he hits home runs."	Braun did just that with solo shots in the first and the fifth -- and the second might have added to the frustration that got Molina and La Russa tossed later in the inning.	With one out, Braun clobbered a 2-1 pitch from Wainwright into the Brewers' bullpen in left field. After Prince Fielder struck out, Corey Hart came to the plate and took a borderline pitch low and outside for a ball.	Molina complained about the call and was ejected by home plate umpire Paul Schrieber as La Russa was walking out of the dugout.	"Everything was OK," Molina said. "It was that pitch. I asked him where it was. He didn't like it, and he threw me out."	Molina protested his ejection by taking off his gear and leaving it in a pile at Schrieber's feet.	"That was awesome," Wainwright said. "If you're going to get tossed, you might as well make it a good one. That was one of the better ones I've seen."	La Russa continued to argue and eventually was thrown out himself.	"I thought it was really unfair because Yadier has got a reputation for being as respectful and as professional (as anyone) out there," La Russa said. "He questions one breaking ball, and then the next one he questioned, and he said, 'That's far enough.' I don't understand how he could be so impatient with a guy who has established that he's a real pro."	Speaking of reputations, Braun is beginning to show that last year was no fluke.	"Yesterday showed it," Yost said. "Today confirmed it."	Milwaukee's bullpen, however, remains a serious question mark for a team that still considers itself a playoff contender.	Struggling reliever Eric Gagne was shaky in his first outing since admitting he didn't deserve to be the Brewers' closer any more on Saturday -- a statement he tried to take back before Monday's game. And the team's current closer-by-committee approach didn't look much better when left-hander Mitch Stetter walked his way into giving the Cardinals a chance to come back in the ninth.	Gagne walked the first batter he faced, then got a double play and a groundout. He stayed in for what turned out to be a sloppy eighth inning that included a walk, two singles and a wild pitch.	Another deposed closer seeking redemption, Jason Isringhausen, pitched a scoreless eighth for St. Louis.	Stetter then opened the ninth for Milwaukee but also struggled, walking the first two hitters he faced, getting two straight popouts, and then walking in a run with two more bases on balls. Right-hander Guillermo Mota came in with the bases loaded and struck out Rick Ankiel for his first save since April 23, 2005 while pitching for the Florida Marlins.	Yost took it as a positive sign that Gagne wanted to keep working instead of leaving the game with a relatively good feeling after the seventh. But Yost admitted Stetter's wildness was "a bit alarming."	Brewers starter Dave Bush (1-4) gave up a run and four hits in six innings. Bush also led off the third with a double, setting the stage for what would become a five-run inning.	Game notes	 Brewers CF Mike Cameron doubled in the third, snapping an 0-for-14 stretch. ... Ankiel hit his seventh homer of the season in the first. ... Gagne's appearance in the seventh inning was the first time he had pitched in a game before the eighth since April 2, 2002 for Los Angeles against San Francisco.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- There were fireworks again when Texas and Seattle played -- for a different reason this time.	Instead of flared tempers, they were the pyrotechnic displays sparked by Texas home runs, including a game-winning shot by Ramon Vazquez in the 10th inning as the Rangers rallied for a 13-12 victory Monday night.	"I wouldn't say it was the weirdest game I've been in, but when you score 12 runs, you expect to win," Vazquez said. "We kept battling back."	Vazquez's homer came on a 1-0 pitch with one out in the 10th off Brandon Morrow (0-1), who struck out the only other four batters he faced after Seattle tied it with four runs in the ninth off closer C.J. Wilson.	Josh Hamilton and Milton Bradley hit back-to-back towering homers to start the third against Erik Bedard, who had a five-run lead before even throwing a pitch. Those homers ignited a four-run inning that put Texas up 6-5 and chased Bedard.	"What a game!" Rangers manager Ron Washington said when entering his postgame session with reporters, then repeating that statement when he left. "I guess y'all didn't think we had a chance when we fell behind 5-0 to Bedard. We fooled y'all and Bedard."	Only four nights after Mariners first baseman Richie Sexson charged the mound and flung his helmet at Texas pitcher Kason Gabbard to ignite a bench-clearing brawl, the AL West rivals met again. Sexson was with his team, but not playing while serving the third game of his five-game suspension for his actions. He'll miss the entire Texas series.	Morrow struck out the side in order in the bottom of the ninth. Morrow then struck out German Duran to start the 10th before Vazquez, the No. 9 batter, ended the 4-hour, 9-minute game by pulling a drive down the right-field line for his second homer of the season.	Doug Mathis (1-0), the sixth Rangers pitcher, threw a perfect 10th in his major league debut.	"It's the coolest thing I've ever been a part of," said the 24-year-old Mathis, who was called up Sunday after the Rangers put starter Kevin Millwood on the disabled list.	Seattle tied it with four runs in the ninth, with Kenji Johjima capping that outburst with his first homer of the season, a three-run shot with two outs off Wilson that made it 12-12. Raul Ibanez had an RBI double earlier in the inning.	It was only the second blown save for Wilson, the left-hander who has converted eight times.	The only time things got heated between players was in the Texas seventh when Vazquez struck out and exchanged words with pitcher Ryan Rowland-Smith, who pumped his fist after the third strike. Vazquez yelled at the pitcher while slowly walking back to the dugout and Rowland-Smith returned verbal jabs. But they weren't close to each other.	The Rangers then took advantage of a two-out error in the seventh by second baseman Jose Lopez to score four unearned runs and take a 10-6 lead. After Wladimir Balentien hit a two-run homer in the eighth, the Mariners gave those runs right back when Michael Young and Hamilton drew consecutive bases-loaded walks, off different pitchers.	"We don't like to make excuses, we had bad control," said Johjima, the Seattle catcher.	Gabbard is the scheduled starter Tuesday against Felix Hernandez, the same matchup from Thursday. Hernandez hit two Texas batters before Sexson charged the mound after an eye-high pitch that was more over the plate than inside.	Hamilton led off the third with a 447-foot shot to right-center before Bradley followed with a 410-foot homer. There was then a four-pitch walk before Gerald Laird doubled and Chris Shelton had an RBI single that tied the game and chased Bedard. Laird scored his tiebreaking run on a double-play grounder.	Hamilton had a two-run single after Lopez's error and finished with four RBIs, increasing his majors-best total to 43.	Texas starter Vicente Padilla pitched into the sixth, but a no-decision kept him from his sixth victory, which would have matched the American League lead and equaled his total for all last season.	Padilla gave up four hits and five runs -- only two earned after two Texas errors -- in the first inning Monday.	An error by third baseman Vazquez allowed the first Seattle run before Ibanez hit a two-run homer.	In his last start at Texas on July 7, pitching for Baltimore, Bedard tied an Orioles franchise record with 15 strikeouts while tossing a two-hitter and facing the minimum 27 batters. But the Rangers scored each inning against him Monday.	"Just wasn't a good day," Bedard said.	Game notes	 The Rangers have won 10 of their last 13, while Seattle has lost 11 of 13. ... Six Seattle pitchers combined to allow 14 hits and 13 walks. it was only the third time in Rangers franchise history they had at least 13 walks, and the first since April 1996. ... Bradley left with a sore right shoulder, lifted in the seventh for pinch-hitter Frank Catalanotto, whose RBI single made it 10-6.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CHICAGO (AP) -- Carlos Zambrano switched to longer sleeves after three innings, not so much to combat the cold -- as would be expected -- but to cover a scab on his pitching arm.	Big Z was plenty ready for the elements on a 41-degree night in mid-May and showed his sense of humor Monday night after pitching and batting the Chicago Cubs to a 12-3 win over the San Diego Padres.	"It's OK for me. I'm from Alaska," Zambrano said, drawing laughs at his postgame news conference.	"No, it's tough man, especially for me. I'm from South America, Venezuela. It is not this cold. Not even close," he said.	"As a starting pitcher ... don't worry about the cold factor, just try to hit your spots and try to do the best you can to keep the inning quick."	But the Cubs made sure the Padres couldn't get off the field soon enough, scoring six runs in the fifth -- started by Zambrano's double -- and adding five more in the sixth, when he added a single. They had 13 hits and made the most of nine walks issued by the Padres.	Pitching with an extra day's rest after his start Sunday was scratched because of rainy conditions, Zambrano (6-1) allowed six hits and three runs in seven innings. And he was part of a batting order that was on base all night.	"I think we have a very good lineup, very balanced," said Alfonso Soriano, who homered in the fifth and is 7-for-14 during the Cubs' four-game winning streak. "Be more aggressive and, at the same time, selective at home plate. That's what I try to do because I know when I swing at a strike, I know that I hit the ball very hard."	The Cubs' first eight batters reached in the fifth on six hits and two walks. Randy Wolf (2-3) didn't retire a batter in the inning and in four-plus innings, he gave up eight hits, seven runs and five walks.	"In the fifth inning, there is really no way to candy coat it," Wolf said. "I was bad. I didn't make the pitches I needed to. They capitalized on it. You get behind and you don't locate. Those are two recipes for something bad to happen."	Jody Gerut's first homer in nearly three years gave the Padres a 2-1 lead in the top of the fifth, but the Cubs quickly responded.	Zambrano drove a ball off the wall in right-center for a leadoff double and Soriano followed with a drive to left-center that just cleared the fence for his fourth homer, putting Chicago up 3-2.	Ryan Theriot walked, Derrek Lee singled and Aramis Ramirez had an RBI single before Kosuke Fukudome worked a walk to load the bases. Geovany Soto's two-run single through the middle made it 6-2 and finished Wolf. Mark DeRosa then greeted reliever Sean Henn with an RBI single.	"He couldn't make a pitch to get himself out of it," Padres manager Bud Black said of Wolf.	In the sixth, the Cubs batted around again. They loaded the bases for the third time in the game on Soriano's double and walks to Theriot and Ramirez before Fukudome drew his third walk of the game to force in a run.	It got worse for the Padres, who have the worst record in the majors at 14-25.	When DeRosa hit a grounder to third baseman Kevin Kouzmanoff, he tried to race to the bag for a force, but Ramirez beat him there. Kouzmanoff then threw wildly to first for an error and three runs ended up scoring on the play as the Cubs went up 11-2. Reed Johnson later added an RBI single.	Fukudome's three walks were a big part of the Cubs' offense.	"The guy knows how to play baseball," Zambrano said. "He came to the U.S. ready to play. One thing I see in Fukudome is he can handle it with all the media and all the fans."	Lee's double into the right-field corner scored Theriot, who singled, in the first to put the Cubs ahead 1-0. Tadahito Iguchi hit an RBI single in the third to tie it.	Game notes	 Zambrano has 17 multihit games in his career. ... Gerut's last homer came on May 24, 2005, against the Twins while he was playing for the Indians. He wasn't in the majors the last two years. ... Padres C Michael Barrett, bothered by a sprained right elbow ligament, threw before the game and could go on a rehab assignment soon. ... Padres LF Scott Hairston fell over the Cubs' bullpen mound chasing Fukudome's foul fly in the sixth, but wasn't hurt. ... Edgar Gonzalez, just called up from Triple-A, had an RBI single in the seventh for his first major league hit. He is the brother of Padres' first baseman Adrian Gonzalez. ... Former Cubs pitcher Mark Prior, now with the Padres, had a setback in his rehab from shoulder surgery in April 2007. When he felt discomfort in his shoulder at extended spring training in Arizona, he was sent back to San Diego for an MRI, Black said. Prior might visit Dr. James Andrews, who performed the surgery, to be checked out.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Nick Adenhart didn't have long to enjoy his first major league victory. He was just happy to get it before he was sent down to the minors to make way for John Lackey's return to the Los Angeles Angels' rotation.	After pitching the Angels to a 10-7 victory over the Chicago White Sox on Monday night, Adenhart was optioned to Triple-A Salt Lake and Jose Arredondo was recalled from the team's Pacific Coast League club to give manager Mike Scioscia an extra arm in the bullpen before he gives the ball to Lackey for his first start of the season Wednesday night.	Lackey, who won 18 games last season for the defending AL West champions, has been sidelined since March 21 with a strained right triceps.	"My role was to come up for a few starts and do what I could to help this team win," Adenhart said. "It was kind of a long week or so after a rough start but I made strides in the right direction. It was a little bit of a burden to not have that first W, but now I've got it out of the way and I can kind of move on. It feels good."	Adenhart (1-0) allowed four runs and nine hits in 5 2/3 innings, walking three and striking out one. It was the third start for the 21-year-old right-hander, who has given up 12 earned runs, 18 hits and 13 walks over 12 innings.	"He's got good stuff and he's got a chance to be pretty good," White Sox catcher A.J. Pierzynski said. "He got a little wild here and there, but other than that he's got a good curve ball, good changeup and good life on his fastball."	Vladimir Guerrero homered and drove in four runs, helping the Angels snap a four-game losing streak. The four RBIs matched Guerrero's total in his previous 23 games.	Jermaine Dye had four hits for the White Sox, who scored two runs in the eighth against Chris Bootcheck and one in the ninth against Scot Shields before Francisco Rodriguez got the final two outs for his major league-leading 15th save. He ended it by striking out Pierzynski with runners at the corners.	Mark Buehrle (1-5) gave up eight runs and 10 hits in 5 2/3 innings with six strikeouts. The left-hander has allowed 14 earned runs over 11 1/3 innings in his last two starts, after a 2-0 loss at Toronto in which he gave up a pair of unearned runs through eight innings. He is 0-5 with a 5.26 ERA in his last six outings.	"Maybe he angered the baseball gods somehow because he's got some bad luck going, so we've got to find a way to change his luck around," Pierzynski said. "	Buehrle is 1-5 with a 4.76 ERA lifetime against the Angels, and is winless in his last 12 regular-season starts against them since pitching a four-hitter at Anaheim on Aug. 8, 2001.	"It's frustrating," Buehrle said. "Anytime you make your pitches and guys put the ball in play, anything can happen. You've just got to keep your composure and try to get outs. But I'm not going to sit there and complain. There are going to be games where they hit the ball real hard five or six times and make outs. You keep on saying it all evens out. I just hope it starts evening out soon."	Trailing 4-2, the Angels pulled ahead 6-4 in the fifth on Guerrero's three-run homer and Garret Anderson's RBI triple, one of his three hits. Rookie Sean Rodriguez and Gary Matthews Jr. opened the inning with infield hits before Guerrero drove a 1-0 pitch to left-center for his fourth homer and first since April 25.	"It was inside and off the plate. But that's Vlad. He swings at it," Pierzynski said. "We've thrown him pitches a foot outside and he hits homers to right field. Tonight we pitched him a foot outside and he hits a homer to left. I think that was the first pitch we throw him inside the whole game. That just shows you how good he is and how dangerous he is."	Anderson's second triple of the season came after another infield single by Robb Quinlan.	"They hit some balls in some perfect places." Pierzynski said. "They found holes, and Vladdy obviously had the big blow. Then it kind of started to snowball from there."	Third baseman Joe Crede, who had a pair of RBI singles for Chicago, committed a two-base throwing error on Matthews' two-out grounder in the sixth. It led to four unearned runs and a 10-4 Angels lead. Erick Aybar chased Buehrle with an RBI double, Guerrero followed with an RBI single against Ehren Wassermann, and Casey Kotchman added a two-run single against Boone Logan.	"We needed every one of those runs as it turned out," Scioscia said. "It was good to see some guys break out. We did a good job with runners in scoring position."	Before the game, Scioscia presented White Sox shortstop Orlando Cabrera with the Gold Glove Award he earned last season with the Halos in a brief ceremony at home plate. It was Cabrera's second Gold Glove, the other coming in 1991 with the Montreal Expos.	Game notes	 Cabrera played three seasons with the Angels before they traded him to Chicago for RHP Jon Garland in November. Cabrera is batting .230 with a homer and six RBIs in 143 at-bats. Garland is 4-3 with a 4.30 ERA in eight starts. ... Angels RHP Dustin Moseley, who gave up Jim Thome's 500th career homer on Sept. 16 at Chicago, gave up three hits and no runs over 3 2-3 innings while striking out six in a 60-pitch rehab start with Class-A Rancho Cucamonga. He went on the disabled list May 4 with tightness in his forearm.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- For Barry Zito, a no-decision became a positive thing -- a sign of progress. Lance Berkman is too much for any pitcher to handle right now.	Hunter Pence hit a go-ahead sacrifice fly in the seventh, Berkman had a tying two-run homer off Zito and the surging Houston Astros beat the San Francisco Giants 7-3 on Monday night for their fourth straight victory.	Roy Oswalt (4-3) retired the final 14 batters he faced to win his fourth straight decision since starting the season 0-3, and the right-hander struck out six in eight innings without giving up a walk.	"Roy settled down and our guys woke up about the sixth inning," Houston manager Cecil Cooper said. "It was a big win for us and for Roy. He hasn't seen the eighth inning much."	Vinnie Chulk (0-1) gave up Pence's sacrifice fly in the seventh on the way to the loss.	Berkman hit his 13th homer to match Philadelphia's Chase Utley for the major league lead and also doubled, singled and has an 11-game hitting streak. Pence has hit safely in 10 consecutive games for the Astros, who won for the ninth time in 10 games.	Cooper wasn't even sure until a couple of hours before game time whether Berkman would play because of a tender groin. The star cleanup hitter raised his average from .382 to .393. In 15 games since April 26, he has batted .509 (29-for-57).	"As long as I keep it manageable, this is the way it's going to be until it gets better," Berkman said of his injury. "If I stay smooth, there should no trouble. It doesn't bother me when I'm swinging. ...	"The guys are playing well and you want to try and win as many games as you can when it's like this. The offense hung around until we got the opportunity."	Berkman also tied the Houston club record by scoring a run in his 15th consecutive game, equaling Carlos Beltran.	"He's a hard guy to go through," Cooper said.	Jose Valverde got the final out in the ninth for his ninth save. He entered with two runners aboard, then gave up a single to Rich Aurilia that loaded the bases. Pinch-hitter Ray Durham flied out to left to end it.	Zito, San Francisco's $126 million left-hander who turns 30 on Tuesday, was through after six innings and 103 pitches, leaving with the score tied at 3. He lost his first seven starts of 2008 and even was given a week off to try to get right.	"I was little more aggressive and that paid off," Zito said. "I don't know if I'm building toward a win. That's out of my control. I'm building toward being more aggressive and having better command."	The fickle fans who have regularly booed him turned their jeers to cheers for Zito, winless since beating Los Angeles last Sept. 30 at Dodger Stadium.	"That's awesome," Zito said of receiving a warm reception. "I didn't quite know it. I was focused on what I had to do."	John Bowker hit a solo home run, and Fred Lewis and Omar Vizquel each doubled in runs in the third for San Francisco. After Bowker's homer, the Giants didn't get another baserunner against Oswalt.	"The way to pick up wins is to go deep in a game," Oswalt said. "If I can outlast the other starter, I have the chance."	Zito pitched scoreless ball into the fourth inning for the first time all season, and his signature curveball was effective once again in matching his longest outing of the year at six innings. He received a standing ovation -- perhaps slightly sarcastic -- after a 1-2-3 first inning in which he needed only 11 pitches.	"He's been competing," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "Z's going to be fine. If he pitches like this, he's going to be fine. ... To me, he's got a good feel for what he's doing out there now. He's confident. He's a standup guy. He wants the ball. He's not worried about the record."	Houston's Brad Ausmus singled leading off the third for his 1,500th career hit. He also became the eighth catcher in major league history with 1,500 career hits and 100 career stolen bases -- and the third active catcher, joining Milwaukee's Jason Kendall and Ivan Rodriguez of the Tigers.	Miguel Tejada's sacrifice fly in the sixth put the Astros on the board after Pence and Mark Loretta hit consecutive singles off Zito to start the inning. Berkman followed Tejada with his drive into the seats in left-center.	Jose Cruz Jr. also drove in a run for Houston against his former club.	Game notes	 Vizquel moved back to the No. 2 hole in the order after drawing three intentional walks Sunday. ... The teams came in tied for the major league lead with 40 stolen bases each and neither added to their total. ... A moment of silence was held before first pitch in memory of 18-year-old Anthony Giraudo, who was killed Friday outside the ballpark. He was allegedly punched in the head during an argument and then hit his head on the ground.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

BALTIMORE (AP) -- Dave Trembley couldn't contain his pleasure after watching the Baltimore Orioles beat Josh Beckett and the defending world champion Boston Red Sox.	"It says something about our team, the way the guys came back against one of the better pitchers in baseball," Trembley said after Tuesday night's 5-4 victory. "We had to work for it. We had to earn it. But I think everybody learned a little bit more about the Baltimore Orioles tonight. I'm real proud of our team. They just played tremendous."	The Red Sox were without manager Terry Francona, who will miss the two-game series following the death of his mother-in-law. He was replaced by bench coach Brad Mills, now 5-4 when subbing for Francona.	Luke Scott homered and had three of Baltimore's 11 hits off Beckett, but the most notable performances came from starter Jeremy Guthrie and the bullpen. Guthrie blanked Boston after a shaky first inning, Jim Johnson worked out of an imposing jam in the seventh and George Sherrill got five straight outs to earn his 14th save.	It all added up to a satisfying win for a team picked by many to finish last in the AL East. Baltimore is 20-19 and just 2 1/2 games behind the first-place Red Sox.	"It means a lot to me and I'm sure it means a lot to the team and our fans because there's still that dilemma out there: Is this team going to snap or crack? They're not," Trembley insisted. "These guys will stick together. And that's what they did tonight."	Scott was mired in a 7-for-55 skid before going 3-for-3 against Beckett, who came in 4-0 with a 2.05 ERA in four career starts at Camden Yards. Scott's three-run homer in the third inning put Baltimore ahead 5-3, and the advantage stood up.	"Well, he certainly was due," Trembley said of Scott.	Guthrie (2-3) allowed three runs, two earned, and eight hits in six-plus innings. The right-hander, who had a season-high seven strikeouts, kept the Red Sox scoreless following a three-run first.	After Guthrie yielded successive singles to start the seventh, Jamie Walker walked David Ortiz to load the bases. Johnson then got Manny Ramirez to bounce into a 1-2-3 double play to conclude a 10-pitch at-bat, and Mike Lowell followed with a fly ball to left.	"He worked a pitching miracle," an appreciative Guthrie said of Johnson.	Alex Cora hit an RBI single in the eighth before Sherrill finished. Ortiz was ejected in the ninth after arguing with umpire Laz Diaz, who called him out on a check swing with the count full.	Beckett (4-3) gave up five runs in 5 2/3 innings. The 11 hits was the most allowed by a Boston starter this season.	"The loss definitely goes in the right man's hand tonight," Beckett said. "It's pretty simple. I just didn't execute pitches tonight."	It was the fourth loss in five games for the Red Sox, who stranded 10 and went 2-for-11 with runners in scoring position.	"We're still having some good at-bats. Any time you have the bases loaded and nobody out and you don't score, you kind of get a little bit frustrated," Mills said. "At the same time, we are still having some good at-bats."	Boston lost two players during the game: J.D. Drew sprained his left wrist diving for a third-inning liner in right field, and center fielder Coco Crisp left with an upset stomach.	"Anytime you lose two outfielders during a ball game, it's going to be tough," Mills said.	The Red Sox took advantage of two Baltimore errors to go up 3-0 in the first inning. After Ramirez hit an RBI single, Ortiz scored when Aubrey Huff botched Lowell's grounder to third. Two batters later, Ramirez scored when first baseman Kevin Millar let a two-out grounder go through his legs.	But just as they did one night earlier in Minnesota, the Red Sox lost after opening with a three-run first.	The Orioles got a run back in the second on an RBI single by Jay Payton, then sent eight men to the plate in a four-run third. Millar singled in a run with two outs before Scott drove a 1-0 pitch far over the 25-foot scoreboard in right field.	"It was a [terrible] pitch. Right down the middle," Beckett said.	It was Scott's second home run; the other came April 8. He finished 3-for-4, his first three-hit game since April 6.	Game notes	 Orioles 3B Melvin Mora was scratched when he was struck in the right shoulder by a grounder during warmups. ... Boston fell to 27-10 against Baltimore since the start of the 2006 season. ... The Red Sox are 1-8 on the road against AL East foes.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Indians are trying to mix in some timely hitting with their stellar starting pitching and strong defense.	Paul Byrd and two relievers combined for the Indians' fourth shutout in seven games and Ryan Garko delivered a three-run homer in a 4-0 victory over the Oakland Athletics on Tuesday night.	The Indians got seven hits, just one fewer than they had in a doubleheader split Monday night with Toronto after which manager Eric Wedge blasted his hitters for poor preparation at the plate.	"It was better, they had tougher at-bats and it was good to see [Travis] Hafner help us out," Wedge said.	Cleveland's designated hitter came in hitting .179 (7-for-39) in his previous 13 games. He went 2-for-4 with an RBI to lift his overall average to .223.	Byrd (2-3) allowed five hits over 7 1/3 innings, striking out a season-high seven without a walk.	The right-hander extended the Indians' scoreless streak to 34 innings by their starting staff. The last run allowed by a Cleveland starter came Friday night in the fifth inning against Toronto by C.C. Sabathia -- the only run yielded by an Indians starter in the last 39 innings.	"I definitely had a little pressure on me," Byrd said. "It was like I'm a loser if I give up one run."	Wedge wishes Cleveland's hitters would feed off one another's success as well as the pitchers and fielders are doing.	"It's a friendly competition," Wedge said of the starting staff's streak. "[They] try to keep one-upping one another."	Hafner singled home a first-inning run off Justin Duchscherer (3-2) and got a two-out single off lefty Alan Embree in the eighth before Garko connected off former teammate Andrew Brown.	Rafael Perez retired the only Oakland batter he faced and Masa Kobayashi worked the final 1 2/3 innings for his first save. The 33-year-old right-hander, signed as a free agent in November, had 227 saves the last eight seasons in Japan.	Byrd's performance came after Cliff Lee pitched nine scoreless innings Monday night in the second game following Fausto Carmona's five-hitter in the opener. Before a rainout Sunday, lefty starter Aaron Laffey pitched seven innings in a 12-0 win Saturday.	"All we ask is to give us a chance to win, but they're going above the call of duty," Wedge said.	So is second baseman Asdrubal Cabrera, who turned the 14th unassisted triple play in history Monday and again brought the crowd to its feet with a spectacular play. The 22-year-old ran into center field to snare a looping ball off the bat of Bobby Crosby to start the eighth.	"I didn't think there was any way he'd get to that ball," Wedge said. "Incredible."	It was one of several fine plays in support of Byrd.	"My box score is going to look great in the paper, but it's because of those guys," Byrd said. "I just kept fist-pumping after every one. If they don't make those plays, who knows how many runs I give up?"	In the second, Grady Sizemore fielded Crosby's two-out single to center and threw out Frank Thomas trying to score from second. Catcher Victor Martinez tagged the 39-year-old DH, whose awkward slide stopped well short of the plate.	"With two outs, you've got to go for it," Oakland manager Bob Geren said when asked why the lumbering Thomas was waved around third. "It was a good throw, right on the money."	In the third, left fielder David Dellucci's leaping catch against the wall robbed Donnie Murphy.	Byrd got out of a two-on, one-out jam in the fifth by striking out Murphy and with the runners in motion, Martinez threw out Crosby trying to steal second.	Sizemore robbed Kurt Suzuki leading off the sixth, making a diving catch of a short fly ball in left-center.	Duchscherer allowed one run and fanned six over 6 2/3 innings. The right-hander retired 13 in a row after Hafner's hit before Sizemore began the sixth with a single.	In the seventh, Cabrera got a one-out single. With two outs, Duchscherer hit Casey Blake with a pitch and was replaced by left-hander Embree, who fanned Sizemore.	Game notes	 Hafner got his 460th RBI as Cleveland's DH, surpassing Andre Thornton's team record. ... Cleveland right-hander Jake Westbrook, out since April 22 with a strained ribcage muscle, threw a simulated game off the Progressive Field mound in the afternoon. "I felt fine, threw all my pitches, about 60 of them," said Westbrook, who is scheduled to make a rehab start at Class A Lake County on Saturday. ... Oakland third baseman Eric Chavez, recovering from offseason back surgery, is due to start a rehab assignment Thursday at Triple-A Sacramento. ... Geren said second baseman Mark Ellis remains day-to-day with a strained left hamstring. ... Martinez went 1-for-2 and has hit safely in 20 of his last 21 games, going 27-for-79 (.334).

PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Jayson Werth almost ruined a strong hitting performance with an untimely miscue in the field. Brad Lidge bailed him out.	Werth drove in four runs, Kyle Kendrick pitched six effective innings and the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Atlanta Braves 5-4 on Tuesday night.	Kendrick (3-2) shook off a shaky first inning and allowed three runs and six hits. Lidge finished for his 10th save in as many chances, though he allowed his first earned run of the season.	Chipper Jones went 3-for-4 for the Braves, raising his major league-leading average to .415.	Kendrick settled in after giving up three runs and three hits in the first. J.C. Romero worked out of trouble in the seventh and Tom Gordon pitched the eighth, before turning it over to Lidge.	Lidge hadn't allowed an earned run in 17 2/3 innings before Brian McCann hit an RBI double with two outs in the ninth. Werth completely misplayed the liner to center, breaking in and allowing the ball to sail over his head.	Lidge then walked Greg Norton, but retired Jeff Francoeur on a fly to right field to end it.	"I read the swing, the crowd was yelling and I wasn't able to hear the contact," Werth said. "It was a one-handed swing. I read in all the way. It was definitely a miscue. You learn from it."	Trailing 3-0, the Phillies rallied against Jo-Jo Reyes (1-1) in the fourth. Chase Utley singled to start the inning and Ryan Howard lined a double to center. Werth, who was 3-for-4, ripped a one-out single to center to cut it to 3-2.	Howard's RBI single with two outs in the fifth drove in Shane Victorino to tie it at 3. After Pat Burrell singled, Werth knocked in Howard with a single to left.	Werth blooped a single to left that scored pinch-runner Eric Bruntlett with two outs in the seventh for an insurance run.	"I haven't been hitting well with guys on base," Werth said. "I'm glad I got the guys in when it counted."	Reyes gave up five runs and 11 hits in 6 2/3 innings.	"I think this was the best I've thrown up here," Reyes said. "My command was the key. I didn't walk anybody and I was locating my fastball."	Werth played center for the first time since Victorino returned from the disabled list. Victorino started in right, though manager Charlie Manuel isn't planning to make a permanent switch.	"He made a mistake, but he can correct that," Manuel said about Werth misjudging McCann's hit. "I said before the season I wanted Werth to play some in center. I played him there tonight because it was time to give him some time there."	Jones had an RBI single in the first and Francoeur's two-run single gave the Braves a 3-0 lead.	"I fell behind and left some pitches up," Kendrick said. "With the offense we have, you just have to keep it close."	A sellout crowd of 44,101 broke into a "Let's Go Flyers" chant several times throughout the game. The NHL's Philadelphia Flyers played the Pittsburgh Penguins across the street in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals, but lost 4-1.

CINCINNATI (AP) -- Jeff Keppinger's broken left kneecap took all the luster away from the Cincinnati Reds' second straight win over a first-place team.	Edinson Volquez pitched six effective innings, Joey Votto homered and Cincinnati earned a costly 5-3 victory over the Florida Marlins on Tuesday night.	"That's a real big loss, but you have two choices," Reds manager Dusty Baker said. "You can feel sorry for yourself, or you can figure out a way to get it done. It could've been worse. He'll have an MRI [Wednesday] to determine the severity."	Pinch-hitter Cody Ross homered in the eighth to cut Cincinnati's lead to 5-3, and Jeremy Hermida milked a leadoff walk in the ninth against Francisco Cordero. Hermida advanced to second on a wild pitch but Cordero retired Hanley Ramirez and Jorge Cantu on groundouts and struck out Dan Uggla for his seventh save.	Keppinger, the team's leading hitter, fouled a pitch off his leg in the second and X-rays revealed the injury. The shortstop drew a bases-loaded walk to make it 2-0 and played defense in the third and fourth innings before departing.	"That's a huge blow," said Jerry Hairston Jr., who moved from right field to shortstop after Keppinger left the game. "It's a shame. He's worked so hard to make a name for himself. Now we've just got to step up."	Keppinger entered with a .320 batting average and was tied for third in the National League with a .406 average with runners in scoring position. He took over as the starting shortstop when Alex Gonzalez opened the season on the disabled list with a broken left knee.	Reds slugger Ken Griffey Jr. got the day off and remained stuck on 597 career home runs. Griffey has not homered in his last 63 at-bats since connecting against Houston's Chris Sampson on April 23.	Florida has lost two straight after winning seven in a row.	Volquez (6-1) allowed one earned run and a season-high seven hits with two walks. His National League-leading ERA rose from 1.06 to 1.12 and he struck out five to increase his league-best total to 57.	"He's got good stuff, man," said Uggla, who struck out with the bases loaded to end the fifth inning. "I was sitting on a slider, and that's what he threw me, but it was almost impossible to hit. I could've been more patient."	"It was a changeup," Volquez said. "That might have been the best pitch I threw the whole game."	Hairston, Votto and Corey Patterson had two hits apiece. Patterson hit for Keppinger in the fourth inning and stayed in the game in center field with Ryan Freel moving from center to right to replace Hairston.	Votto's eighth homer of the season, an opposite-field solo shot to left in the seventh, gave the Reds a 5-2 lead.	Freel reached on an infield single with the bases loaded in the second, Adam Dunn had an RBI groundout in the third and catcher David Ross drove in Hairston with a bunt single in the fifth.	"You've got to tip your hat," Florida manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "That was a hell of a bunt. He just executed it."	"You want small ball, but you want long ball, too," Baker said. "When you get both on the same night, you can score some runs."	Mark Hendrickson, who hadn't walked more than three batters in any of his previous eight starts, walked three in the second inning to help the Reds score twice.	Hendrickson (5-2) allowed four runs and eight hits in five innings. He issued a season-high five walks and struck out one.	"The last two games, I've had trouble finding my rhythm," Hendrickson said. "The hits you can't control, but the walks made it hard on myself. A lot of my problems were self-induced."	Hendrickson, who had won his last five decisions, absorbed his first loss since opening day against the New York Mets.	Game notes	 Reds RHP Bronson Arroyo is scheduled to make his fourth career start on three days' rest Wednesday against Florida. Arroyo is 1-0 with a 3.05 ERA (20 2/3 innings, seven earned runs) and one shutout in his previous three starts on three days' rest. ... Hendrickson had two hits, giving him six this season, two more than his total from his previous five seasons ... Cody Ross' home run was the third pinch-hit homer of his career.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

NEW YORK (AP) -- Ryan Church lashed a line drive to right in the sixth inning, harder hit than his homer in the second for sure, and he paused momentarily in the batter's box to watch the ball's trajectory.	Once he saw Austin Kearns hesitate, he knew he had another hit.	The liner-turned-double drove in two of Church's four runs against his former team, and John Maine pitched six sharp innings to lead the New York Mets over the Washington Nationals 6-3 on Tuesday night.	"I saw it start tailing a little bit and I saw him freeze, like 'Whoa,'" Church said, adding a shimmy for visual effect. "I've been in that position before."	A night after Mets starter Nelson Figueroa called the Nationals "softball girls" for cheering in the dugout during his loss, Maine (5-2) hit Felipe Lopez with his first pitch of the game. The ball grazed Lopez's right leg but the leadoff hitter angrily threw his bat in front of the plate and briefly glared at Maine as he walked down first base.	Maine said he was just trying to establish the inside of the plate.	"I just got a little too inside I guess," he said with a shrug.	There were no other moments of potential trouble, even when David Wright had to dive to the dirt to avoid being hit by a pitch. The Mets amassed more than 10 hits for the second straight night, but got timely hits late this time to beat the Nationals and improve to 3-2 on their seven-game homestand against last-place teams.	The Mets left 11 on base Monday and nine Tuesday, a trend that disturbs Mets manager Willie Randolph.	"We're not capitalizing on our opportunities," Randolph said. We just have to do a better job of getting guys in."	Maine was mostly dominant for his second straight start, allowing just two runs -- one earned -- and two hits and retiring 11 of the last 12 batters he faced after giving up Ryan Zimmerman's two-run homer in the third.	In his last outing, Maine took a shutout into the ninth inning against the Dodgers. He hasn't given up more than two runs since his first start of the season on April 5.	"He's throwing the heck out of the ball," Randolph said. "Becoming very reliable for us. He's in a nice groove right now.	He was removed for pinch-hitter Fernando Tatis, who was called up from Triple-A New Orleans earlier Tuesday. Tatis singled in his first big league at-bat since 2006 and scored on Church's hit that zipped over Kearns' outstretched glove for a 4-2 lead.	"I thought I had a read on it," Kearns said. "It didn't do what I thought it was going to do. It carried, I knew it would. He hit it hard, but it hooked or it cut or something."	Matt Wise, activated from the disabled list Tuesday, gave up a run in the seventh, Duaner Sanchez walked two in a scoreless eighth and Billy Wagner gave up a hit in the ninth to finish the four-hitter and earn his eighth save.	John Lannan (3-4), 3-1 with a 2.17 ERA in five previous starts, gave up 12 hits and four runs in six innings.	"He's struggled with left-handed hitters," Nationals manager Manny Acta said. "He made a mistake with Church, leaving a ball over the plate, but it wasn't him so much. We just couldn't get anything going."	It could have been worse if not for two stellar defensive plays with runners on first and second to keep it tied.	In the fourth, the speedy Reyes hit into a difficult 5-4-3 double play. And Lastings Milledge made a running basket catch of Delgado's drive, crashing into the wall as he corralled the ball to end the fifth. Milledge, however, made an error in the eighth that led to Reyes' RBI single and Church's sacrifice fly for a 6-3 lead.	Church, who came to New York in an offseason trade with Washington, nearly hit the big red apple just beyond the center-field fence leading off the bottom of the third to tie it at 2.	The Mets took the early lead in the second on Brian Schneider's groundout after Moises Alou hit an infield single and Carlos Delgado bunted for a base hit to the third-base side with the Nationals in a pull shift. Delgado said it was his third bunt hit for the Mets.	"Technique wasn't great, but in that situation all you have to do is get it down with an ocean of room over there [third base]," Randolph said of Delgado's bunt.	Game notes	 2B Damion Easley made two errors for the Mets. ... The Mets purchased the contracts of RHP Claudio Vargas and from Triple-A New Orleans. Vargas will start Wednesday against the Nationals. Tatis is filling Angel Pagan's spot. Pagan was placed on the 15-day DL with a bruised shoulder. To make room for Vargas, the Mets cut Figueroa. The Mets also cut RHP Jorge Sosa. ... Washington LF Elijah Dukes got his first hit of the season in the seventh, a double. He was 0-for-11 after injuring his right hamstring on Opening Day.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.	Jhoulys Chacín has agreed to a guaranteed $1.25 million, one-year contract with the Rockies.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Six straight wins. Eleven in a row at home. First place in the AL East.	The Tampa Bay Rays realize it's only mid-May, but they're having a ball during the best start in franchise history.	"I've been around a long time. It's early, but I love the way we're doing it by not giving in to anyone," veteran closer Troy Percival said Tuesday night after Gabe Gross singled with no outs in the 11th inning to drive in the first run Mariano Rivera has allowed all season in a 2-1 victory over the New York Yankees.	"We're winning close games against good teams," Percival said. "The way we're fighting, you can see it's not a fluke."	Cliff Floyd began the 11th with a single and pinch-runner Jonny Gomes stole second before Gross delivered the winner up the middle on a 1-1 pitch. Rivera (0-1) had not allowed a run in 14 previous appearances.	J.P. Howell (3-0) pitched two scoreless innings for the win, the Rays' 15th in 20 games. Tampa Bay matched its longest winning streak of the season at six games and has won a club-record 11 in a row at home.	Even sweeter, they're a half-game ahead of Boston in the AL East after the Red Sox lost 5-4 at Baltimore. It's the first time the Rays have sat alone atop the division standings beyond the first week of a season.	"It's great to be here, and a big part of it is the confidence derived from it," manager Joe Maddon said, adding that he thinks his young team has the capability of remaining in the race. "Nobody's cocky or complacent. Everybody's coming to the ballpark with the right attitude."	At 23-16, the Rays are seven games over .500 for the first time in the team's 11 seasons. They've finished last nine times in the past decade.	"They're pitching better. They're making some plays, and they run," Rivera said. "They do all the little things. But the most important thing is they're pitching."	The Rays were two outs away from victory when Hideki Matsui hit his first homer since April 15, a stretch of 57 at-bats, into the right-field seats off Percival to send it to extra innings.	Even though the closer couldn't hold the lead, he walked off the mound feeling the Rays were in good shape.	"I was thinking this team has the heart to come back and win," he said. "Don't give up another run."	Eric Hinske drove in Tampa Bay's first run with a two-out, fourth-inning single off Chien-Ming Wang, who allowed one run and seven hits in seven innings. The Yankees starter walked three and struck out two.	Rays starter Edwin Jackson scattered five hits over seven innings before leaving a 1-0 lead to the bullpen.	"I said before the series, they're a very good team," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "They've improved every year. They've worked hard getting people in here, and they've done a good job."	The keys to Tampa Bay's strong start have been consistent pitching, improved defense and timely hitting, such as Hinske's RBI single after Carlos Pena led off the bottom of the fourth with the only extra-base hit off Wang.	Matt Garza pitched seven scoreless innings in Monday night's 7-1 win over the Yankees, and Jackson took up where he left off.	The Yankees threatened in the second, sixth and seventh innings against the Rays starter, but stranded runners at third all three times.	Robinson Cano hit into a force play and Alberto Gonzalez grounded into a double play after Jackson gave up singles to Jason Giambi and Melky Cabrera in the second. Bobby Abreu and Matsui failed to come through after a diving Hinske played what should have been a single to right into Derek Jeter's one-out triple in the sixth.	Pinch-hitter Shelley Duncan took a third called strike, ending the seventh after Cabrera moved from second base to third on a wild pitch.	"We didn't have a lot of opportunities," Girardi said. "But the few that we had, we squandered."	Game notes	 Attendance was announced as 16,558, up from 13,392 on Monday night. ... The Rays improved to 3-0 in extra innings. The Yankees are 0-1. ... Giambi is the only major leaguer with at least five homers who have more homers (seven) than singles (six) this season. ... New York plans to recall RHP Ian Kennedy from Triple-A Scranton-Wilkes Barre to start Thursday's series finale against Rays LHP Scott Kazmir. To make room on the roster, the Yankees are pondering whether to send LHP Kei Igawa to the minors. ... Rays OF Rocco Baldelli, on the 60-day disabled list because of a condition that leaves him feeling extremely fatigued after short workouts, took batting practice before the game. ... Two of the Yankees top relief pitching prospects, right-handers J.B. Cox and Mark Melancon, were promoted Tuesday: Cox from Double-A Trenton to Scranton-Wilkes Barre and Melancon from Class A Tampa to Trenton.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Eric Gagne is back -- apparently for good.	After a one-day break from his role as the Milwaukee Brewers' closer, Gagne pitched a scoreless ninth inning to save a 5-3 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Tuesday.	But just as it has been all season, Gagne's outing wasn't without drama. The struggling reliever allowed a single and a walk before getting Juan Pierre to hit into a pop fly and earn his 10th save of the season.	"It feels good," Gagne said. "A little relief, you know?"	Brewers manager Ned Yost admits he's taking a gamble by giving Gagne his job back so soon after blowing five saves a little more than a month into the season. But Yost said taking a by-committee approach to closing can disrupt a bullpen, and he ultimately had to trust his player.	"Sure, I could not pitch him so that nobody thinks that I'm stupid for pitching him," Yost said. "But I've never done that. I believe and I trust in my guys, and Eric Gagne's my closer."	It was the fifth straight loss for the Dodgers, who started without three top players because of injury, illness and inconsistency.	And it came thanks in large part to Ryan Braun, who continued his hot streak with a two-out, two-run double that put Milwaukee ahead for good in the fifth inning.	But Braun's big hit might not have happened if Dodgers starter Brad Penny (5-4) hadn't walked the pitcher to lead off the inning.	"I made the crucial mistake," Penny said. "I walked the pitcher and that was the difference in the game. I just didn't throw strikes."	Coming off one of the worst outings of his career last week, Penny gave up two runs in the first four innings, then led off the fifth with a four-pitch walk to Brewers pitcher Carlos Villanueva (2-4).	Penny came back to get two quick outs and had Milwaukee's Mike Cameron down 0-2 before giving up a single that brought up Braun, who was coming off back-to-back two-homer games Sunday and Monday.	This time, the 2007 NL Rookie of the Year bashed a double off the left-field wall to give the Brewers the lead. Prince Fielder followed up with a single to score Braun.	"It's huge," Braun said. "I am definitely seeing the ball well right now. For me, any pitch that I am getting that I should hit, I am hitting."	Then came closing time, a sore spot for the Brewers all season.	Milwaukee's closer situation has been up in the air since Saturday, when Gagne said after another rough outing that he didn't deserve to pitch the ninth anymore. Gagne said before Monday's game that he wants another shot at closing, but Yost used him in the seventh and eighth innings Monday night.	Given a chance to close Tuesday, Gagne allowed a leadoff single to Russell Martin before getting Blake DeWitt to hit into a fielder's choice and Mark Sweeney to fly out. DeWitt advanced to second on a passed ball, and Gagne walked Andruw Jones before getting Pierre to pop out. But Gagne didn't breathe until the ball ended up in J.J. Hardy's glove.	"The way it's been going, you never know," Gagne said. "Maybe a bird was going to fly out or something."	Yost said Gagne made a "simple adjustment," although he wouldn't provide specifics.	"I just think that he just needed a day to get away from closing, and that day was yesterday," Yost said.	Villanueva went six innings for Milwaukee, giving up eight hits and three runs (only two were earned) for the win after losing his last four decisions.	The Dodgers have scored a total of 10 runs in their five straight losses.	Los Angeles was playing without three key players on Monday. Manager Joe Torre gave Jones the night off before using him as a pinch-hitter in the ninth, shortstop Rafael Furcal was placed on the 15-day disabled list retroactive to May 6 with a lower back injury and closer Takashi Saito was unavailable while he recovered from an illness.	Torre said losing Furcal wasn't the reason the Dodgers were losing.	"He does a lot for us," Torre said. "But for us to sit here and say that's the reason that we're not winning, I don't think that is the case. He is certainly missed. We still need to pitch better."	Game notes	 Brewers RHP Yovani Gallardo had surgery Tuesday morning to repair the ACL he tore in his right knee May 1. Assistant general manager Gord Ash said the results were "outstanding" and Gallardo would begin rehabilitation Wednesday. ... The Dodgers purchased the contract of Luis Maza from Triple-A Las Vegas to take Furcal's place.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Ramon Vazquez hurt the Seattle Mariners for the second straight night -- this time with a flyball that stayed in the park.	Vazquez drove in the go-ahead run with a sixth-inning sacrifice fly and the surging Texas Rangers beat Seattle 5-2 on Tuesday night.	Vazquez went deep in the 10th inning Monday night to give the Rangers a 13-12 victory over the Mariners in the opener of the three-game series. He finished with two RBIs Tuesday night as Texas won for the 12th time in 14 games.	"Yesterday we needed to score 13 runs," Rangers manager Ron Washington said. "Tonight we needed three but got five. Any situation that presented itself offensively, we did it."	Gerald Laird hit a leadoff single against Seattle starter Felix Hernandez in the sixth, and took second when left fielder Raul Ibanez bobbled the ball for an error.	Laird, who went 2-for-3 and reached base four times, advanced to third on Chris Shelton's sacrifice and scored on Vazquez's flyball to left to put Texas in front 3-2.	Vazquez added an RBI single in the eighth and Ian Kinsler followed with a sacrifice fly to make it 5-2.	Vazquez also made a diving catch near the foul line on Adrian Beltre's line drive to end the seventh, and Josh Hamilton came up with a nice running catch near the center-field wall to deny Kenji Johjima's bid for extra bases in the eighth.	"Each time they made them was at an important point of the game," Washington said. "If they don't make them, something bad happens. There was defense everywhere. They were very good."	Josh Rupe (2-1) allowed one hit in 1 2/3 scoreless innings and Eddie Guardado pitched the ninth for his first save since Aug. 12, 2006, for the Cincinnati Reds.	The Mariners, losers of 12 of 14, committed four errors.	"It puzzles me a lot because it's one of the big strengths of our club," manager John McLaren said of his team's defense. "When we try to build around our pitching, we need our defense. We can't be giving away four outs. When you give them extra opportunities, it changes the whole complexion of the game."	Rangers starter Kason Gabbard allowed two runs and five hits over 5 1/3 innings five nights after Mariners first baseman Richie Sexson charged the mound and flung his helmet at Gabbard to touch off a bench-clearing brawl in Seattle.	"I was just happy to make it past the fifth inning," Gabbard said. "Everything felt good tonight."	Sexson sat out Tuesday night, serving the fourth of his five-game suspension.	Hernandez (2-4) allowed two earned runs and six hits in six innings, losing his fourth straight start. He walked five and struck out three.	Seattle pushed across two runs in the sixth. Jose Lopez hit a sacrifice fly and Johjima doubled in a run to tie it at 2.	Before the season, the Mariners were projected as playoff contenders on the strength of their starting pitching. But inconsistent pitching, sloppy defense and a lack of clutch hitting have contributed to a poor start that has left Seattle (15-26) with the worst record in the AL.	"Obviously it's not fun to be losing," designated hitter Jeff Clement said. "It's tough to be happy when things aren't going well.

CHICAGO (AP) -- Shawn Estes had some serious doubts if he was ever going to get his 100th career victory.	Khalil Greene hit a three-run homer to help Estes reach that milestone and win his first game since 2005 with the San Diego Padres' 4-3 victory over the Chicago Cubs on Tuesday night.	Estes pitched 5 1/3 innings and the Padres' bullpen secured the win with 3 2/3 innings of hitless relief. Trevor Hoffman pitched a scoreless ninth for his seventh save in nine chances. It was the 531st save of his career.	Estes (1-0), who pitched 1 2/3 innings in relief on Thursday, only made one start in 2006 for the Padres and missed the 2007 season recovering from Tommy John surgery. He replaced Justin Germano in the rotation.	"I didn't think I was going to make it back last year. I was going through a lot of pain in my elbow again," said Estes. "I came into spring training having to deal with the mental side of pitching again and having to make a team and having to swallow my pride a little bit and going back to Triple-A to get things right."	Alfonso Soriano led off the first inning with a home run and Reed Johnson had a two-run double for the Cubs.	Cubs starter Jason Marquis (1-3) couldn't hold an early 3-0 lead. He gave up back-to-back singles to Adrian Gonzalez and Scott Hairston in the fourth inning before Greene's homered onto Waveland Ave. to tie the game.	With two outs, Marquis gave up a single to Estes, who moved to second base on a wild pitch then scored on Jody Gerut's double to give the Padres a 4-3 lead.	Marquis pitched 5 2/3 innings and gave up four runs and nine hits.	"He had five good innings and one bad inning and it cost him a ballgame," said Cubs manager Lou Piniella.	Estes showed a little rust early, giving up Soriano's homer and Johnson's double in the second inning. Estes allowed three runs, two earned on seven hits. He struck out two and walked one.	"Soriano's first at-bat wasn't a very good greeting for a guy who hadn't [started] in two years in the big leagues but I was able to make pitches after that and settle down," said Estes.	Soriano now has 45 leadoff homers, passing Brady Anderson for third most in major league history.	The Cubs couldn't take advantage of a strong wind blowing out to left as Estes was able to locate and mix his pitches after the second inning and keep the Cubs off-balance.	"I think he just settled into a rhythm and he was throwing a lot of strikes and he was going after guys. He fell behind some big hitters in big situations and came right after them," said Johnson.	Game notes	 Padres 3B Edgar Gonzalez, older brother of Adrian, made his first big league start. ... Cubs RHP Sean Gallagher will make his second start of the season on Friday against the Pirates. Gallagher pitched 4 1/3 innings in a no decision against the Diamondbacks on Sunday. Gallagher made a spot start for Carlos Zambrano, who was a late scratch because of wet weather. ... The game was played through steady rain.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Jose Guillen has turned jeers into cheers.	He was booed after going 0-for-4 with three strikeouts to drop his average to .165 on May 5. Since then, Guillen has put together a five-game hitting streak, going 10-for-18, with five doubles, to raise his average to .216.	He drove in a pair of runs to help the Kansas City Royals rally to beat the Detroit Tigers 3-2 on Tuesday night.	"He's been swinging the bat pretty good the last week," said Mark Grudzielanek, who had three of the 12 Kansas City hits. "It's important for him to do that and get some hits. Nobody wants to be down there like that, especially a good hitter like him. Guillen's a great hitter and he's had success in the league for a lot of years. He's not going to be there (below .200). The big rallies, he's usually going to be in the middle of it."	Despite his average, Guillen is tied for the club-lead with 19 RBIs.	"It's good to see that bat get going," Royals manager Trey Hillman said. "We need it. That's what we got him for. He's swinging the bat very well. The most important thing for me is we got behind and didn't panic. We got some key hits from Guillen."	Guillen has said do not worry about him, that he is normally a slow starter.	"Jose didn't really like the cold weather, so hopefully the more it heats up the more he heats up," Royals catcher John Buck said. "It gets really hot around here and I know he can get really hot, so we're all for it. We'll see how hot he gets when it gets around 100."	With the game tied 2-2 in the eighth inning, Guillen doubled with two outs off Francisco Cruceta (0-1). Esteban German ran for Guillen. After Billy Butler walked, Mark Teahen had an infield single, but Edgar Renteria committed a throwing error on a backhanded flip to second base, allowing German to score an unearned run.	"That's the only chance we had," Renteria said. "You take a chance like that. If we win the game, everything is all right. That's a tough play. In that situation you have to take the best chance you have and I thought it was my best chance. You always want to get an out that late in the game. It was just a reaction."	Leo Nunez (3-0), the third of four Kansas City pitchers picked up the victory. Joakim Soria worked a perfect ninth to earn his ninth save in as many opportunities. He has yet to give up an earned run.	Detroit left-hander Nate Robertson gave up a season-high 10 hits, but only two runs. He allowed at least one hit every inning except the seventh, but for the first time in eight starts did not walk a batter.	"I was commanding my slider," Robertson said. "I made pitches when I had to get an out. I'd like to have the pitch back to Guillen that I left out over the plate."	Guillen doubled home David DeJesus and Grudzielanek with two out in the third for the only runs Robertson would allow. Grudzielanek went 3-for-3 off Robertson and is 8-for-9 in his career against the pitcher.	"Grudzielanek finds a way," Robertson said. "He didn't hit any one of those balls very well."	Zack Greinke held the Tigers to two runs. His ERA did go up to 1.93, which ranks second in the American League.	Greinke gave up a run in the first when Carlos Guillen's one-out double scored Placido Polanco.	Matt Joyce homered in the second for the only other run Greinke would permit.	"Tonight was good, but it started off real bad," Greinke said. "I said just keep it right there, go six or seven and more than likely we're going to win the game."	The last-place Tigers have lost eight of 10 and have dropped all four games to the Royals this season.	Game notes	 Tigers LF Gary Sheffield drew his 1,400th career walk in the eighth. He is the 26th player in big league history to reach that plateau. ... Royals CF Joey Gathright picked up his 10th infield single in the third. ...Soria broke a Royals record with 16 scoreless appearances to start the season. RHP Hipolito Pichardo started the 1997 season with 15 scoreless appearances.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Kevin Slowey kept throwing, and Scott Rolen just kept fouling them off.	It took Slowey 15 pitches before he finally got Rolen to groundout to shortstop in the kind of patient, hard-working at-bat Blue Jays manager John Gibbons has been looking for to jumpstart his woeful offense.	Two pitches later, Matt Stairs sent a changeup soaring into the upper deck in right field, and the Blue Jays were on their way to a 5-3 victory over the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday night.	"Wore him out," Gibbons said proudly. "That was a huge at-bat."	Stairs reached base all three times and scored twice and Lyle Overbay and former Twin Shannon Stewart each had two hits, including RBI-doubles, for the Jays, who scored at least five runs in a game for just the second time in the last 10 games.	Carlos Gomez and Jason Kubel hit solo homers for Minnesota, but reliever Dennys Reyes was charged with his first earned run of the season after a so-so start from Slowey (0-3), and the Twins lost at home for just the second time in 13 games.	After scoring 27 runs in taking three of four from the Red Sox over the weekend, the Twins had a big let-down against Jesse Litsch (5-1) and the last-place Jays, swinging early in the count and committing a couple of defensive blunders that cost them a pair of runs.	"We didn't play good baseball," manager Ron Gardenhire said. "We were just kind of a little sloppy out there."	Litsch threw just 70 pitches while giving up two runs and four hits in 5 2/3 innings, and the Twins could only scrape together one more run against relievers Jesse Carlson, Jason Frasor, Armando Benitez, Scott Downs and B.J. Ryan, who picked up his sixth save in as many tries.	"You want to work the count, but you don't want to be hitting 0-2 every time," Twins second baseman Brendan Harris said.	The Blue Jays have been as miserable offensively in May as the Twins were in April. Toronto snapped a 31 1/3-inning scoreless streak with three runs in the 10th to beat Cleveland in the second game of a doubleheader on Monday night.	The Jays scored just four runs in the four-game series against the Indians and became the first team in nearly 20 years not to score a run in the first nine innings of both games of a doubleheader.	"People always say we have been struggling so bad, and we have. But it is one of those things where you have to tip your hat to the pitchers," Stairs said. "We've come across some pretty good pitchers the last two weeks. We got some big hits last night and it carried over into tonight's game."	Slowey needed 107 pitches to get through his 5 2/3 innings, giving up three runs on five hits with five strikeouts.	"Overall I thought I threw well," Slowey said. "Just not well enough."	Rolen's marathon at-bat came in the sixth, softening up the right-hander for Stairs, who hit his 21st career homer against Minnesota, his most against any team, for a 3-1 lead.	Slowey said Rolen's at-bat didn't affect his performance against Stairs, but admitted that he "didn't enjoy it."	"Scott Rolen's a great hitter and has been for a long time," Slowey said. "He was up there and he battled really hard. Whether that had any affect on my next couple of pitches, I really couldn't tell you. That's just how it went."	Toronto tacked on two more off relievers Matt Guerrier and Reyes, but the night could have been much bigger if the offense truly clicked. The Jays left eight runners on base, including six in scoring position.	"That was fun," Rolen said. "We moved the bats better. We still left some people out there, and left some opportunities open."	Game notes	 Overbay got caught in a hard-luck double play in the second inning when Stewart hit a line drive right at Harris. Assuming it was going to be caught, Overbay trotted back to first. But the ball popped out of Harris' glove, and he quickly started a 4-6-3 double play to end the inning. ... Gomez was charged with an error in the first inning when his throw from CF on a single by Hill sailed over SS Adam Everett's head and into the Twins dugout, allowing Hill to go to 3B. "I caught it in the dugout," Gardenhire said. "That's always a bad sign."	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Ronny Paulino was ready when Pittsburgh catcher Ryan Doumit broke his left thumb. It helped that the Pirates were facing the St. Louis Cardinals.	Paulino singled in the go-ahead run in a four-run 10th inning for his second crucial hit in an 8-4 victory over the Cardinals on Tuesday night.	"He's taken advantage of his opportunities," manager John Russell said. "He came up big for us tonight."	Doumit was injured in the first inning and Paulino entered in the second. He went 2-for-5 and drove in two runs to improve his career numbers against the Cardinals to a .316 batting average with 17 RBIs.	Troy Glaus hit a three-run homer and Albert Pujols tied it with his eighth in the eighth for the Cardinals, extending his hitting streak to 12 games. Pujols, who had a day off on Monday, also walked twice and has reached base in all 40 games.	It's the majors' longest streak at the start of the season since Derek Jeter's 53-game run in 1999 for the Yankees.	Adam LaRoche added a three-run double off Ron Villone (1-1) in the 10th for the Pirates, who have won seven of eight and are one game below .500.	"I wouldn't mind ruining the save situation every night," LaRoche said. "We need those extra runs, especially against this lineup."	Nate McLouth hit a two-run homer and Paulino had a game-tying double in the seventh.	Doumit was injured on a passed ball in the first, and Russell said he has a small fracture near the tip of his thumb. The manager said Doumit would return to Pittsburgh on Wednesday to be examined, and likely would be sidelined from 10 days to three weeks depending on the severity of the break.	Marino Salas (1-0) worked around three walks, one intentional, and escaped a bases-loaded jam in a scoreless ninth to win in his major league debut. Salas, whose contract was purchased from Triple-A Indianapolis earlier in the day, got Ryan Ludwick on a high fly to shallow right to end the inning.	"That's a tough time for a guy and a lot of times there's nothing you can say," LaRoche said. "They're kind of out of their element. He looked like he was pretty calm, and I said, 'Hey, it's another game.'"	Villone, who entered with a 1.26 ERA, allowed four runs, four hits and two walks in the 10th. The Cardinals have lost six of seven.	"Pathetic location, pretty much," Villone said. "If the ball was anywhere in the strike zone it was in the middle. If not, it wasn't close."	Manager Tony La Russa refused to use a reconfigured bullpen with struggling closer Jason Isringhausen in middle relief as an excuse. Isringhausen never got up in the bullpen and La Russa said two others were unavailable due to recent work.	"A couple of guys we stayed away from," La Russa said. "The guys we pitched, we could have won it anyway."	Glaus connected against Phil Dumatrait in the sixth for his second homer of the season. The drive also provided his first RBIs this month and gave the Cardinals a 3-2 lead.	The Pirates came up empty with the bases loaded in the ninth against Ryan Franklin, who retired pinch-hitter Chris Gomez on an infield popup.	Glaus, who has four seasons with 37 or more homers, entered the game in a 3-for-30 slump. He singled in the fourth before his low liner barely cleared the wall in left-center in the sixth.	Kyle Lohse retired the first nine batters in order before Freddy Sanchez singled to open the fourth and McLouth followed with his 10th homer just inside the right-field foul pole. Lohse breezed through eight more hitters before the seventh.	Lohse, who looked like a mid-March free-agent steal at $4.25 million for this season, has allowed 20 earned runs over 16 innings in three starts this month.	Game notes	 The Cardinals have no interest in re-signing Jim Edmonds, released by the Padres, on the cheap. "I think we have enough left-handed hitting outfielders," La Russa said before the game. ... Glaus' RBIs were his first since he drove in three on April 29 against the Reds. ... The Pirates began a stretch of 22 straight games against NL Central opponents. ... Pirates reliever Damaso Marte worked a perfect seventh and has retired 31 of his last 36 batters. ... Salas is the first Pirates pitcher to win in his major league debut since Paul Maholm on Aug. 30, 2005, at Milwaukee.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

PHOENIX (AP) -- Struggling to find his command, Randy Johnson needed help for his 287th career victory.	Stephen Drew supplied it.	Backed by Drew's three-run homer, Johnson went five shaky innings and the Arizona Diamondbacks beat Colorado 8-4 on Tuesday night.	The Big Unit (3-1) gave up four runs and nine hits, striking out four and walking none.	"Not his best stuff today, but he gives us five [innings], and we're in the lead when he leaves and he ends up getting a win," Arizona manager Bob Melvin said.	Melvin said Johnson bruised his pitching hand trying to field a bouncer by Jeff Baker in the fourth. Johnson left without speaking to reporters.	"He doesn't want to be a five-inning pitcher," Melvin said. "That's not what he's all about. He wants to be at least a seven-inning guy, so I know he was disappointed that he has to come out after five innings."	Johnson won because the Diamondbacks hammered Colorado starter Jeff Francis (0-4), a 17-game winner for the NL champions a year ago. Francis went 4 2/3 innings, his shortest start, and gave up eight runs on 13 hits, both season highs.	Drew had the biggest blow -- a three-run homer in the second that gave Arizona a 6-1 lead.	"It felt good with the team coming out early and putting up some runs," said Drew, who hit his fifth homer.	Drew often bats down in the order against lefties. But he's hitting .412 (7-for-17) lifetime against Francis.	Melvin said he'll probably keep Drew high in the batting order, against lefties and righties. "I think he thrives on hitting up in the lineup," Melvin said.	Garrett Atkins hit his seventh homer and Ryan Spilborghs doubled twice for the Rockies, who fell nine games behind the NL West leaders.	The Diamondbacks were relieved to be back in the feeble NL West, where they are 18-5. Arizona is 6-10 against everyone else.	"It's good to be able to play well against our division," right fielder Justin Upton said. "We've seen these guys quite a few times, so we feel comfortable."	Chris Young had three hits for the Diamondbacks, who improved to 6-1 against Colorado.	The Rockies swept the Diamondbacks in the NL championship series last fall. Francis beat Arizona in the opener of that series, but the Diamondbacks have shelled him in three meetings this year, piling up 20 runs on 32 hits -- including seven homers -- in 16 innings.	"This is three times he's faced this club, and they've squared him up pretty good," Colorado manager Clint Hurdle said.	Francis started his career 7-1 against Arizona but has lost his last four regular-season starts against the Diamondbacks.	"He's got some history on his side that he needs to continue to pay attention to," Hurdle said. "That being said, you've got to perform, execute and make pitches."	With Chase Field's roof open on a 77-degree evening, the Diamondbacks pounced on Francis with four straight singles to open the first inning. Orlando Hudson, Conor Jackson and Mark Reynolds each had RBI singles as Arizona took a 3-0 lead.	"They hit four singles to start off the game, and that's going to kill you," said Francis, whose ERA climbed one run to 6.27. "It's not like they hit four homers to start the game, but they put themselves in a position to score a lot of runs, and I couldn't put out the fire."	Colorado cut it to 3-1 in the second on a single by Atkins, a double by Spilborghs and a sacrifice fly by Baker.	The Diamondbacks responded with three more in the second. Johnson, a .167 hitter, led off with a drive off the base of the left field fence, but he stumbled as he rounded first and was held to a single.	"I thought it was gone," Melvin said. "I think he did too. I think he was watching it, might have had something to do with it at first base."	Young singled and Drew followed by hitting a 1-0 delivery into the right field seats to give the Diamondbacks a 6-1 lead.	Game notes	 With the victory, Johnson tied Bert Blyleven for 26th place on the all-time list. He's 16-7 against Colorado. ... Atkins has hit in 11 straight games. ... Hudson was back in the lineup after missing six games with a hamstring injury. ... Arizona LHP Doug Davis, who is returning from thyroid cancer surgery, will start for Triple-A Tucson on Sunday. Davis could rejoin the Diamondbacks' rotation next week. ... Colorado manager Clint Hurdle rested 1B Todd Helton, a career .238 hitter against Johnson.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Jered Weaver looked nothing like a pitcher who had a 7.02 ERA over his previous six starts.	Weaver allowed one hit over seven innings, combining with two relievers on a three-hitter, and Mike Napoli hit a tiebreaking sacrifice fly in the eighth to lead the Los Angeles Angels to a 2-0 victory over the Chicago White Sox on Tuesday night.	"I just went out there and tried to pitch like the old Jered, and it came out all right," Weaver said. "It was just adjustments with mechanics in the bullpen between starts. Me and [pitching coach Mike] Butcher were able to clean some stuff up.	"The arm strength's coming along," he added. "The more innings I get, the better my arm strength is going to get. That's the way it's always been. I always seem to get stronger as the season went along. I guess the six days rest kind of helped, too."	Manager Mike Scioscia couldn't have been more pleased with the right-hander's dramatic turnaround.	"That's the best stuff Jered's had in two years," Scioscia said. "He maintained it and he finished strong. His pitch count got a little high, but the last couple of innings he regrouped and finished hitters off better. You can't throw the ball much better than Weave did tonight. It's very encouraging."	A.J. Pierzynski's leadoff single in the fifth was the only hit off Weaver, who pitched seven innings. He struck out six and walked one, coming out of the game after 109 pitches. He came in 1-4 since pitching seven scoreless innings of three-hit ball in a 2-1 win over Texas on April 5.	"He just missed our bats," Jermaine Dye said. "I mean, he threw a lot of breaking pitches, a lot of changeups in hitter's counts, and was able to get ground balls and flyballs."	Chicago starter John Danks had a hard-luck no-decision, although he had to work hard for it. Pitching against the Angels for the first time in his career, he scattered seven hits and two walks over 6 1/3 innings, struck out five and never retired the side in order.	Danks departed with one out and the bases loaded in the seventh after walking Gary Matthews Jr. with his 99th and final pitch. Octavio Dotel struck out Erick Aybar and Vladimir Guerrero to escape the jam.	But Dotel (1-2) gave up a leadoff single in the eighth to Torii Hunter, who took third when Garret Anderson got the green light on a 3-0 pitch from Matt Thornton and singled to right field. Napoli's delivered Hunter with a flyout to center, with Anderson alertly tagging up, and Robb Quinlan drove in the second run with a two-out single against Scott Linebrink.	Scot Shields (2-0) pitched one inning for the win and Francisco Rodriguez got three outs for his major league-leading 16th save.	The Angels stranded a runner in scoring position in four of the first five innings. Hunter grounded out with a man on third base to end the first, Guerrero hit into a double play to end the third, Casey Kotchman flied out to end the fourth, and Aybar grounded out to end the fifth.	"We left way too many runners in scoring position," Scioscia said. "We stranded a lot of guys and were 1-for-12 with guys in scoring position. So it was a night we needed to pitch well, and we did. We scratched out a couple of runs late and held on."	Chicago manager Ozzie Guillen flip-flopped Paul Konerko and Dye in his lineup, dropping the slumping Konerko to fifth and putting Dye in the cleanup spot for the fourth time this season following his four-hit performance on Monday night. But they didn't get a runner past first base until Carlos Quentin doubled off the center fence with one out in the ninth.	"We haven't been scoring too many runs lately, but our pitchers have been going out there and giving us a chance," Dye said. "We just have to try and bear down a little bit more and get some runs across for them early."	Game notes	 After the game, the Angels optioned INF Kendry Morales to Triple-A Salt Lake to clear a roster spot for RHP John Lackey -- who will make his season debut Wednesday night after missing 41 games with a strained triceps. ... Hall of Famer Carlton Fisk is returning to the White Sox as a team ambassador, the club announced Tuesday. Fisk and Guillen were teammates for nine years in Chicago, winning a division title in their last season together (1993). "I think it's great. It's about time," Guillen said. "To us, it's an honor. Pudge is a legend. I think he's meant a lot more to the Chicago White Sox than to the Boston Red Sox because of the many years he played for us and the fact that he finished up his career here. I asked Pudge a lot of times to come to spring training with us, but he was busy with a lot of different things." ... The White Sox, who lead the AL with 45 home runs, are 0-10 when they don't hit one.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Matt Cain takes his hitting seriously enough that he hoped Barry Bonds noticed the pitcher's latest power stroke.	Cain provided his own insurance run and limited Lance Berkman to only a base hit.	Cain hit a solo home run and earned his first victory in three starts, and the San Francisco Giants snapped the Houston Astros' four-game winning streak 4-2 on Tuesday night.	"[Bonds] told me last year he'd seen my first and last home run," said Cain, who now has the indicted home run king's old corner locker. "You run into them every once in a while. I guess if you get your 245-pound body into it, you can get it to move a little."	It was the fourth career homer and second this season for Cain (2-3), whose drive to left leading off the fifth put the Giants up 4-1. He also connected on April 12 against St. Louis after hitting two for Bonds to see last August in the slugger's final season for San Francisco.	"He did it all," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said of Cain. "He hit a home run and pitched eight innings. Today he looked like he was very determined to get it done."	Omar Vizquel and Randy Winn hit back-to-back RBI doubles in the first as the Giants jumped to an early lead on the way to handing Houston its second loss in 11 games.	The Giants started the game with three straight extra-base hits against Brandon Backe (2-5) on the way to a quick 3-0 lead -- a leadoff triple by Fred Lewis, then the doubles by Vizquel and Winn. Winn scored on a passed ball after moving to third on Bengie Molina's fly out.	Carlos Lee hit his eighth homer on an eighth-inning solo shot, but Houston lost for the first time in five games so far during its season-long 10-game road trip.	Berkman singled in the third for a 12-game hitting streak a day after connecting for his 13th home run in Monday's 7-3 win. Cain struck him out swinging to start the eighth, one of Cain's five strikeouts in eight impressive innings. Berkman also drew an intentional walk from Cain in the first.	Cain, who allowed two runs on seven hits and walked four, got better as the game went on. Brian Wilson worked a perfect ninth for his NL-leading 12th save.	"We were just joking in the shower that the way he started wasn't the right way. He wasn't hitting his spots," Molina, the catcher, said of Cain. "Maybe he was a little excited. After that, he got into a nice groove and did the job."	Hunter Pence extended his hitting streak to 11 games with a sixth-inning double, while J.R. Towles snapped an 0-for-20 stretch with his two-out single in the second for the Astros. Lee then got Houston on the board with an RBI single in the third.	The Astros got a scare in the bottom of the eighth. Pence, the right fielder, and second baseman Kaz Matsui collided trying to chase down Molina's bloop single in shallow right. Matsui's left knee banged into Pence's right knee and both were slow getting up as the Astros' trainer ran out to check on them. They stayed in the game.	"We kind of fell all over the place tonight," Houston skipper Cecil Cooper said. "We didn't have an error, but we didn't make the plays we should have."	Backe, who lost consecutive starts for the first time this year and his third in four, was tagged for four runs -- three earned -- on seven hits in six innings. He struck out three and had a season-low one walk.	"When the first batter of the game gets a triple, you want to limit it to just him scoring and leave it at that," Backe said. "The ball dropped and Vizquel made it to second on hustle and scores on the next play. The passed ball was a cutter that cut quite a bit. I didn't throw the ball horribly."	Lewis missed hitting for the cycle for the second time in his career by a home run. He flied out to center in the seventh in his final opportunity.	"I was really thinking about it," he said. "They didn't want to pitch to me. I was like, man, I've got to do this again."	Second baseman Ray Durham returned to San Francisco's lineup after being limited to three pinch-hit appearances in the previous eight games because of tightness in his right hamstring. Durham went 1-for-2 with a walk.	Houston third baseman Ty Wigginton was held out of the lineup after getting hit in the left ribcage area Monday. He had X-rays and could need a couple of days off, Cooper said.	Game notes	 Astros LHP Wandy Rodriguez threw 60 pitches in a simulated game with no problems, a step in his recovery from a strained left groin that put him on the disabled list April 20. He's scheduled to pitch another session Friday. ... Vizquel, who came off the disabled list Saturday following arthroscopic left knee surgery Feb. 27, is scheduled to get the day off for Wednesday night's game. ... Giants LHP Barry Zito celebrated his 30th birthday. ... San Francisco RHP Kevin Correia, sidelined with a strained left side muscle, is slated to throw about 10 pitches off a mound Wednesday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

BALTIMORE (AP) -- In years past, the Baltimore Orioles probably would have wilted against the Boston Red Sox after falling behind by three runs and watching Manny Ramirez make an incredible play in left field.	It didn't happen in Wednesday's 6-3 victory, and the Orioles insist it's not going to happen anymore. Bring it on Red Sox and Yankees or anyone else who thinks this is the same team that has endured 10 straight losing seasons.	"They're not intimidated. They really don't think they should take a back seat," manager Dave Trembley said. "They think they can play with anybody."	Jay Payton hit his fourth career grand slam to back a gritty pitching effort by Daniel Cabrera and the Orioles rallied to complete a two-game sweep. It was the first time since July 2005 that Baltimore won two in a row over its AL East rivals.	"When you're able to beat good teams, it does a little for your confidence," Payton said. "We feel like we can compete with anybody."	Solo homers by Jason Varitek and Mike Lowell and a defensive gem by Ramirez -- yes, Ramirez -- weren't enough to prevent the Red Sox from losing their fourth straight. It was the third consecutive game in which Boston blew a three-run lead.	"I'm not really concerned," Varitek said. "We need to find a way to grind out a win."	Ramirez, to put it kindly, is better known for his prowess at the plate. In the fourth inning, however, he made a difference with his glove.	With runners at first and second and one out, Kevin Millar hit a drive to left. Ramirez made an over-the-shoulder grab on the warning track, reached over the seven-foot wall to slap a Boston fan with a high-five and then turned and threw the ball to Dustin Pedroia. The relay from Pedroia to Kevin Youkilis doubled up Aubrey Huff to complete the 7-4-3 double play.	But Baltimore persevered.	"Ramirez makes a great catch and more times than not, that takes the wind out right of your sails and you say 'OK, here we go again,'" Trembley said. "You don't see that with these guys. They come at you, and they're going to keep coming at you."	The Red Sox were undone by their bullpen, which spoiled a fine outing by starter Jon Lester. Javier Lopez, Craig Hansen and Hideki Okajima were all ineffective in a four-run seventh that doomed Boston to its sixth loss in eight games.	"We've got a good bullpen. You put your trust in them," said Lester, who gave up two runs in six innings. "Nine out of 10 times they get the job done."	The Orioles trailed 3-2 before going ahead in the seventh. With two outs, Freddie Bynum was credited with an infield hit when Pedroia couldn't make a play on a grounder.	"I took a deep angle because it was going to go through," Pedroia said. "I slid for it and had it in my glove, but my knee hit the glove and it came out."	After Hansen (0-2) gave up a single to Guillermo Quiroz and walked Brian Roberts to load the bases, Payton hit the second pitch from Okajima into the left-field seats. The right-handed hitting Payton was surprised the Red Sox called upon a left-hander to pitch to him.	"It goes against the percentages. That's probably the first time I've ever had a lefty brought in to face me, but a lefty got me out my first three at-bats so they were just playing the numbers," Payton said. "He's been throwing the ball great; he just left one over the middle."	That provided Cabrera (4-1) with a rare win over the Red Sox. The right-hander gave up three runs and 10 hits in seven innings, striking out three and walking none. He yielded a hit in every inning but the seventh.	"Daniel did a great job of hanging in there for seven innings and giving us a chance to score a few runs," Roberts said.	Cabrera came in 1-9 with a 7.84 ERA in 11 career starts against Boston. He had lost seven straight to the Red Sox since July 2005.	Aided by Baltimore's fourth double play, George Sherrill got three outs for his 15th save.	Boston got a first-inning run when Jacoby Ellsbury singled, stole second and scored on a single by Pedroia. Varitek homered in the fifth, and Lowell connected in the sixth.	It wasn't enough.	"This team is pretty resilient. We certainly don't quit, that's for sure," Roberts said. "We're going to play all 27 outs. If you can beat us for all 27, then we'll tip our hats. But we're going to grind out every at-bat."	Lester extended his scoreless innings streak against Baltimore to 12 before the Orioles broke through in the sixth on a run-scoring groundout by Payton and an RBI single by Nick Markakis, who was batting .212 with runners in scoring position.	Game notes	 Boston went 4-6 on its 10-game road trip and dropped the last two under Brad Mills, who served as manager while Terry Francona attended the funeral of his mother-in-law. ... Boston put pitcher Clay Buchholz on the 15-day disabled list and recalled outfielder Jonathan Van Every, who got a fifth-inning single in his major-league debut.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

CLEVELAND (AP) -- Indians manager Eric Wedge is certain he's never before seen what his starting staff is accomplishing.	C.C. Sabathia pitched a five-hitter and struck out 11 in the Indians' major league-leading seventh shutout, a 2-0 victory over the Oakland Athletics on Wednesday night that moved Cleveland into the AL Central lead.	The Indians, who took a half-game lead over Minnesota, had not been alone in first this year and hadn't even held a share of the lead since the opening week.	Cleveland starters have pitched 43 1/3 consecutive scoreless innings since Friday.	"It's pretty special stuff what they're putting together right now," Wedge said. "They're going well beyond the call of duty right now. We just want them to give us a chance to win."	The consecutive scoreless streak is the longest by an Indians starting staff since they tossed 47 scoreless innings in August 1948. It's the longest by a major-league team in one season since a 54-inning streak by Baltimore's starters from Sept. 1-7, 1974, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.	Cleveland became the first team to pitch five shutouts in an eight-game span since Oakland from July 12-19, 2002, according to Elias.	"It feels really good," Sabathia said. "Everyone is working hard. Everyone wants to be that guy each night."	Sabathia (3-5) tied his season high for strikeouts, walked two and won consecutive starts for the first time this season. He has a 1.49 ERA over his past five starts.	Sabathia pitched his sixth shutout, his first since a five-hitter against Kansas City last June 5.	"He was outstanding tonight," Wedge said. "His rhythm was dead on. He did a good job moving his fastball. His breaking ball was effective to both left- and right-handed hitters. There were situations where he had to make pitches to finish off innings, and he did that."	Sabathia had lost his prior two starts to Oakland this season, allowing a combined 13 runs and 18 hits in 8 2/3 innings.	"Some of the swings they were taking tonight, he must have been pretty special," Cleveland third baseman Casey Blake said.	Grady Sizemore and Ryan Garko homered off Joe Blanton. Sizemore homered on Blanton's second pitch of the night, and Garko connected in the fourth.	Blanton (2-6) allowed four hits in seven innings, struck out four and walked two. He lost for the fourth time in five starts.	"Runs are going to be few and far between," Blanton said of facing Sabathia. "You just have to go out there and keep it close."	Cleveland has won seven of nine and at 21-19 moved to two games over .500 for the first time since starting the season 2-0. Jhonny Peralta went 2-for-4 with two doubles, snapping an 0-for-15 slump.	Oakland has been held scoreless in its past 23 innings at Cleveland. The A's put two on in the fifth, but Rajai Davis hit into an inning-ending forceout.	"It was another well-pitched game," A's manager Bob Geren. "What are you going to do? It seems like I have said this before. It seems like I sat here and said the same thing 24 hours ago."	Sabathia punctuated his complete game by striking out Jack Cust and Emil Brown in the ninth inning.	"That's the Cy Young Sabathia that normally steps up," said Mike Sweeney, who was 2-for-4. "He made his pitches. In his last couple starts [against the A's], he was over the plate. Tonight he was living on the corners."	Sweeney had a prediction about Sabathia, the reigning AL Cy Young Award winner, who is the final year of his contract.	"If he pitches like that the rest of the year, the contract Johan Santana signed will look cheap," Sweeney said, referring to the $137.5 million, six-year deal Santana signed with the New York Mets.	Game notes	 Sizemore has three leadoff home runs this season and 14 in his career, the second most in franchise history behind Kenny Lofton's 18. ... Oakland's Bobby Crosby hit his 100th double. ... Cleveland closer Joe Borowski, out since April 15 with a strained right triceps muscle, is scheduled to pitch in a simulated game Friday, when the Indians start an interleague series in Cincinnati. ... Cleveland shut out Oakland in back-to-back games for the first time since 1966.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Tom Glavine plans to keep his eyes off the scoreboard next time he takes the mound.	Glavine pitched 5 2/3 effective innings to earn his first win for Atlanta in six years and the Braves held on for an 8-6 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Wednesday night.	"The mistake I made is when I went out there in the sixth inning, I pitched to the score," Glavine said. "That's not a very good thing for me to do. That's the kind of thing that even at my age and my level of experience, you learn some things every now and then. I need to stay in focus and pitch my kind of game."	Chipper Jones, Yunel Escobar and Kelly Johnson each hit solo homers and Brian McCann drove in three runs to support Glavine, who hadn't won a game with the Braves since beating the Phillies on Sept. 19, 2002.	Blaine Boyer got the last four outs for his first career save. He allowed an RBI single to Jimmy Rollins in the ninth, before retiring Shane Victorino on a fly ball to the warning track with the tying run on second base to end it. Boyer is the fifth Braves reliever to record a save this season.	Chase Utley hit his major league-leading 14th homer and Ryan Howard also connected for Philadelphia.	Glavine (1-1) allowed four runs and four hits. He took a one-hitter into the sixth before the Phillies cut an 8-0 deficit in half. The 42-year-old Glavine spent the previous five seasons with the New York Mets after pitching his first 16 years in Atlanta.	"It feels good. It's nice to get back on the board and feel like I'm contributing," Glavine said.	For most of the night, Glavine was in vintage form. He kept hitters off balance with an assortment of slow stuff and pinpoint control.	"He was fantastic the first five," Braves manager Bobby Cox said.	Meanwhile, the Braves teed off on Brett Myers (2-4).	Escobar led off with a homer and Jones hit an opposite-field drive one batter later to make it 2-0. Johnson connected in the second and McCann's two-run double in the third put the Braves ahead 5-0.	Myers left to a chorus of boos in the fifth, and sat by himself in the dugout. He allowed eight runs and nine hits in 4 1/3 innings.	"I'm disappointed that the fans have to watch this," Myers said. I know I'm better than this. It's frustrating."	Myers' return to the starting rotation hasn't gone smoothly. His 5.91 ERA is the worst on the staff. He had success as a closer last year and thoroughly enjoyed the role, but he became a starter again after the Phillies acquired Brad Lidge from Houston. Lidge is 10-for-10 in save chances with a 0.50 ERA.	"I don't know what we can do," manager Charlie Manuel said of Myers' struggles. "Just send him out there and see how it goes."	Trailing 8-0, the Phillies finally got to Glavine in the sixth. Rollins had an RBI double, Victorino drove in a run on a groundout and Utley hit a two-run shot.	"You live and learn in this game, no matter how much you've been playing," Glavine said. "If I come away with one thing tonight, it's don't look at the scoreboard. As far as I'm concerned, every game I go out there it's 1-0. That's the way I have to pitch."	Howard hit an opposite-field drive off Royce Ring to cut it to 8-5 in the eighth. The struggling 2006 NL MVP is showing some signs of breaking out. He has a six-game hitting streak, raising his average to a paltry .182.	Game notes	 Phillies C Chris Coste was 4-for-4, tying his career-best for hits. ... Glavine is 29-17 in 65 starts against the Phillies. ... The Phillies are 9-7 against left-handed starters. ... When Chuck James takes the mound on Thursday night, it'll mark the first time the Braves start three straight left-handers since June 4-6, 1997. It was Glavine, Denny Neagle and Terrell Wade 11 years ago. ... Philadelphia's Greg Dobbs got his ninth pinch-hit, a single with two outs in the ninth. He's 9-for-20.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CINCINNATI (AP) -- Paul Janish's first day in the major leagues ended with a game-winning hit and a bloody nose.	He won't forget either one.	The Cincinnati Reds blew a six-run lead in the ninth Wednesday night, but Janish singled home the tiebreaking run in only his second big league at-bat for a 7-6, 10-inning victory over the Florida Marlins.	His opposite-field hit to right on an 0-2 changeup from Renyel Pinto brought a wave of teammates onto the field for a joyous pummeling, one that left him with a bloody nose. He didn't mind.	"Hopefully, it will only get better, but that's hard to imagine," said the 25-year-old shortstop, who had drops of fresh blood on the pants leg of his white uniform.	The Reds matched their season high with their third straight win, all against a Marlins team that came to town on its best run of the season.	The Marlins arrived with a seven-game winning streak and the best record in the major leagues. By dropping the first three games of the series, they equaled their longest losing streak of the season.	They almost pulled it out.	The Reds went into the ninth with a 6-0 lead and a distinction: The only team in the majors without a blown save. Seven batters later, the lead and the distinction were gone.	"It was scripted until the ninth inning," Reds manager Dusty Baker said. "Like Yogi [Berra] said, 'It ain't over until it's over,' and he ain't lying."	Luis Gonzalez broke the shutout with an RBI double off Mike Lincoln, who left with the bases loaded and no outs. Closer Francisco Cordero, who had been a perfect 7-for-7 in save chances, came on and gave up a two-run single to Matt Treanor.	One out later, Cody Ross hit a three-run homer to left field, raising his fist as he rounded first base. It was the first homer allowed this season by Cordero, and the second in two games by Ross.	"You can't ever give up in this ballpark," Ross said. "You've got to play to the last out in every inning. We did that. We got to Cordero pretty good. I felt pretty comfortable in the ninth."	Pinto (1-2) walked two with two outs in the 10th to bring up Janish, who drove up from Triple-A Louisville earlier in the day. He got into the game as a defensive replacement in the eighth and made two slick plays, drawing cheers from the crowd of 12,756.	When he flied out to deep left field in his first at-bat in the eighth, the fans gave him a standing ovation. His second time up, he took two fastballs for strikes, then went the other way with a changeup.	And, he got another ovation.	"He didn't beat us," Marlins manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "We walked two guys to set that up. But that was our best guy out there. You tip your hat to the kid."	Jared Burton [2-1] pitched a perfect 10th for the win.	The bullpen's meltdown ruined another solid performance by Reds starter Bronson Arroyo, who threw seven shutout innings on short rest.	The Reds pulled ahead 6-0 behind Jerry Hairston Jr., who is Cincinnati's main shortstop with Jeff Keppinger sidelined by a broken kneecap. Hairston had a single, double and RBI triple.	Adam Dunn also homered, and Ken Griffey Jr. had a run-scoring double.	Center fielder Corey Patterson threw out runners at home and third base, helping Arroyo get in position for a win the old-fashioned way -- with only three days between starts. Arroyo gave up five hits in seven shutout innings, throwing 111 pitches. He left after striking out the side in the seventh.	Arroyo volunteered to work on short rest so the club could get its rotation back in order following a weekend doubleheader. In three previous starts on short rest, Arroyo was 1-0 with a 3.05 ERA, including a three-hit shutout against San Francisco in 2006.	"I felt great on three days' rest," Arroyo said. "You pitch one day, and then you're out there again. I felt strong."	Game notes	 Ross batted leadoff for the fourth time this season. ... Gonzalez extended his hitting streak to seven games. ... Janish's mother happened to be visiting Louisville when he was called up. She made the two-hour drive to Cincinnati with him, got to see the ballpark before the game, then watched her son win it. ... The organist played "Happy Birthday" to Tony Perez, who turned 66. Perez played for the Big Red Machine -- his No. 24 is retired -- and was in town as a Marlins special assistant.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

NEW YORK (AP) -- Ryan Zimmerman and the Washington Nationals are last in the NL East. That doesn't mean they're about to roll over for the New York Mets.	Zimmerman hit a long homer and Tim Redding pitched two-hit ball for six innings, sending Washington to a 5-3 victory over the Mets on Wednesday night.	"He had great command of his fastball and his curveball was very good," Nationals manager Manny Acta said. "In order to stay out there and hold those guys to one run and stay patient, it says a lot about him."	Jesus Flores hit a tiebreaking single with two outs in the seventh off Aaron Heilman, who was booed on and off the mound by the Shea Stadium crowd. Washington added three more runs in the inning, sticking Claudio Vargas with a tough-luck loss in his Mets debut.	"He did an outstanding job," New York manager Willie Randolph said. "It's just a shame we weren't able to put together any type of attack."	Brian Schneider homered and drove in two runs against his former club, but New York (20-18) dropped to a disappointing 3-3 on its seven-game homestand against last-place teams. Two of those losses have come against Washington this week.	Redding (5-3) allowed one run and struck out four, improving to 3-0 in three road starts this season. Carlos Beltran's RBI single off Jon Rauch cut it to 5-3 in the eighth, but Rauch retired Endy Chavez on an inning-ending flyout with runners at the corners.	Chavez was in the game as a replacement for left fielder Moises Alou, ejected by plate umpire Dana DeMuth for slamming his bat to the ground following a fifth-inning strikeout.	Rauch worked a perfect ninth, earning his eighth save.	"You can feel comfortable with what you're doing with each pitch, but with a lineup like that you can never get too comfortable," Redding said.	The Nationals won without cleanup hitter Nick Johnson, who traveled back to Washington for additional tests on his sore right wrist. The oft-injured Johnson strained a tendon on a swing late in Tuesday night's game and could be sidelined for a while.	Cut by Milwaukee in spring training, Vargas signed a minor league deal with the Mets and was called up Tuesday from Triple-A New Orleans. He'll get a chance to solidify a spot at the shaky back end of New York's rotation, and he looked good against Washington.	"You can't say enough. Deep into the game and he gave us a great chance to win," Schneider said.	Schneider gave the Mets a 1-0 lead in the fifth with his second homer of the year.	Zimmerman tied it in the sixth with his second home run in two nights. He drove a 2-0 delivery off the facing of the second deck of the left-field stands for No. 7 this season.	"I never like to say I got all of it, but I hit it pretty good," Zimmerman said.	Vargas (0-1) walked Elijah Dukes with one out in the seventh and was lifted for Heilman after throwing 97 pitches. Dukes moved up on a slow groundout and scored on a sharp single by Flores, the young catcher left unprotected by the Mets in the 2006 winter meeting draft (Rule 5).	Flores fought back from an 0-2 count against Heilman.	"The key at-bat of the game," Acta said. "What an at-bat for the kid that was just playing A-ball a couple of years ago. I can't say enough about that kid."	Felipe Lopez added an RBI single, and Cristian Guzman's two-run single off Heilman made it 5-1.	"It's frustrating when you can't hold the game where it is," Heilman said. "Not exactly smooth sailing this year."	Randolph was looking for more than one inning from Heilman because he wasn't going to use left-hander Scott Schoeneweis, who said he spent about 6-7 hours in the hospital early Wednesday with stomach pain.	"I don't feel good, but I feel better than I did this morning," Schoeneweis said after the game. "It kind of comes in waves."	Game notes	 Mets 2B Luis Castillo missed his third straight game with a strained left quadriceps. Damion Easley filled in again. ... Looking to get some at-bats for Dukes, Acta rested CF Lastings Milledge. Dukes was activated from the disabled list last Friday. ... After the game, the Nationals optioned RHP Chris Schroder to Triple-A Columbus to make room for RHP Jason Bergmann, who will be called up from the minors to start Thursday's series finale against New York RHP Mike Pelfrey. ... Redding improved to 13-6 against NL East teams. ... Aaron Boone started at first base for Washington and batted in Johnson's cleanup spot.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Hank Steinbrenner vented. Joe Girardi held a pregame team meeting. The struggling New York Yankees responded with a win.	Mike Mussina has seen it all before.	"It helps being here eight years, and knowing this stuff happens a lot," he said after Wednesday night's 2-1 victory stopped Tampa Bay's six-game winning streak and lifted New York (20-21) back within one game of .500.	"There's huge expectations here, and we have our own huge expectations," Mussina added. "We haven't played anywhere close to them. Sometimes you just have to get together and talk, that's all."	Robinson Cano went 4-for-4, raising his batting average over .200 for the first time since the season opener, and Mussina (6-3) allowed one run and five hits over 6 1/3 innings to win his fifth consecutive start.	The right-hander improved to 18-7 in 31 starts against Tampa Bay, which held on to its slender lead in the AL East.	Girardi held a 35-minute team meeting before the game, however the manager said it had nothing to do with Steinbrenner's comments earlier in the day -- the co-chairman said the team needs to play harder and smarter.	"Nobody is thinking about any words the owner says while you're playing. We need to win games," Yankees captain Derek Jeter said. "Whether or not he said anything, or we didn't have a meeting, we need to win. Everybody realizes that."	Cano, who's batting .205, tied a career high with four hits, including a RBI single in the fourth. Bobby Abreu drove in New York's other run off James Shields (4-3) with a two-out double in the fifth.	Joba Chamberlain struck out the side in the eighth -- and didn't pump his fist. Mariano Rivera bounced back from allowing the winning run in an 11-inning loss the previous night with a perfect ninth for his 11th save in 11 opportunities.	"We have to go out there and fight. Just don't give it up," Rivera said. "If you're going to beat us, you're going to earn it."	Tampa Bay's loss snapped a franchise-best 11-game home winning streak. But the first-place Rays retained a half-game lead over Boston in the division, thanks to Baltimore beating the Red Sox 6-3.	"It's one game. Expectations are high. I like it. I like that everybody's upset tonight," Rays manager Joe Maddon said. "We played well. We lost. They beat us, but we have a chance to take the series [Thursday], so we've got to be ready to go at that point."	Girardi declined to offer details about the Yankees meeting except to say it came from his "heart."	"The effort of the club has been good," he said. "When you don't score runs, you don't look good. We bring energy every day, but the bottom line is it has to translate into wins."	The Yankees entered Wednesday night losers of five of seven and had only scored two runs in dropping the first two games of the series to the surprising Rays.	Shields is one of Tampa Bay's top young pitchers and big part of the team's climb to the top of the standings. He was coming off a one-hit shutout of the Los Angeles Angels, but has struggled throughout his against the Yankees.	Cano's RBI single broke a scoreless tie, and Abreu's pop fly down the left-field line dropped for a run-scoring double that made it 2-0. That was all the support Mussina needed to get his 109th win as a Yankee.	Carlos Pena had two of Tampa Bay's five hits off the Yankees starter, who walked one and struck out four before being replaced by Ross Ohlendorf with a runner on first and one out in the seventh.	The first two batters the reliever faced, Cliff Floyd and Dioner Navarro, singled to break up the shutout. Ohlendorf avoided further damage when Gabe Gross' hard liner headed for left center was snagged by Jeter, and Floyd was doubled off second base to end the inning.	Shields fell to 0-6 in seven career starts against the Yankees, who also beat him 2-0 in New York on April 6.	"It doesn't frustrate me. Losses are losses, wins are wins. I'm going to beat them one day," Shields said. "I think I'll be here for a little bit, I'm sure I'll get my share of wins."	Game notes	 Mussina tied Fritz Peterson and Spud Chandler for 15th on the Yankees' win list. ... Girardi tinkered with his batting order, dropping Jeter from second to third and moving Abreu up to second. ...

MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Eric Gagne got another view of a blown save -- from the bench.	Juan Pierre hit a go-ahead, two-run double in the ninth inning off Guillermo Mota, and the Los Angeles Dodgers overcame a three-run deficit to beat the Brewers 6-4 Wednesday night and stop a season-high, five-game losing streak.	"When you lose five games in a row and have to come back in somebody else's ballpark, hopefully this gets us back on track," Dodgers manager Joe Torre said. "A lot of good things happened. Hopefully we can build on it. Certainly was a good way to break a losing streak."	Milwaukee was ahead 4-3 in the ninth when Mota (1-2) entered. He had gotten his first save of the season Monday as Gagne took a two-day "mental break" from closing.	Brewers manager Ned Yost had said before the game that Gagne, who has five blown saves in 15 chances, would be available for the ninth. But Yost changed his mind and decided Gagne would rest after throwing 60 pitches in two days.	When David Riske left with one out in the eighth because of a hyper-extended right elbow and Salomon Torres and Brian Shouse finished the inning, that left Mota as the best option for the ninth.	"Everybody knows now in the bullpen you've got to be ready for any situation, so I just tried to go in there and do my job," Mota said. "I wasn't able to do it tonight."	Mota walked Delwyn Young with one out and allowed a single to Andre Ethier that put runners on the corners. Pierre drove a pitch deep to left-center to put Los Angeles ahead 5-4, stole third and scored on Andruw Jones' groundout. It was just the sixth RBI of the season for Jones, who is hitting .179.	"I played with Mota so I kind of know how he is," Pierre said of his steal. "I just read it right."	Joe Beimel and Jonathan Broxton (2-1) combined on a perfect eighth for the Dodgers, and Takashi Saito threw a 1-2-3 ninth for his sixth save.	Los Angeles had been 0-18 when trailing after eight innings.	"Hopefully this win can get us back and track and hopefully everybody can settle down and just play baseball," Pierre said. "Overall, pitching and offense everybody is pressing a little bit. That's only natural when you don't win games."	Milwaukee, which had won three in a row, has lost 10 games in which it led at some point.	"I don't think we gave it away," Yost said. "I think that they earned it."	Dodgers starter Derek Lowe allowed four runs and six hits in six innings, while Milwaukee's Manny Parra gave up three runs -- one earned -- and seven hits in 6 2/3 innings.	Parra's two-run single and Jason Kendall's RBI single built a 3-0 lead in the second. Blake DeWitt hit a solo homer for the Dodgers in the fifth, but Corey Hart's RBI single made it 4-1 in the sixth.	Los Angeles closed with a pair of unearned runs with two outs in the seventh. First baseman Prince Fielder bobbled pinch-hitter Mark Sweeney's grounder for a run-scoring error on an in-between hop.	"Yeah, you'd like that play to be made," Yost said. "It's a tough play, but that play can be made."	Pierre chased Parra with an RBI single, a ball to shallow left that Ryan Braun unsuccessfully tried to catch with a dive.	Game notes	 The start of the ninth was delayed after a discussion between Yost and 3B umpire Joe West. Mota said that West allowed him only five warmup pitches, but Yost wouldn't talk about what happened. ... Dodgers RHP Jason Schmidt (right shoulder) threw a bullpen session on Wednesday and is to throw three innings on a rehab assignment Saturday in Class A. ... Torre said 3B Nomar Garciaparra [strained left calf] volunteered to play shortstop if he's ready to return from the 15-day DL before SS Rafael Furcal [back].	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO (AP) -- Ted Lilly has located his strikeout pitch, and Alfonso Soriano has found his batting eye and power.	It was a strong combination Wednesday night, one that led the Chicago Cubs over the San Diego Padres 8-5.	Lilly fanned 11 in six innings to get his third straight win and Soriano had his second leadoff homer in as many nights.	"I don't think I just stand out there and try to throw fastballs by guys," said Lilly, who has consecutive double-digit strikeout games for the first time in his career.	"I have to mix my pitches and change speeds and locate the ball and things like that," he said. "And at times, when I got my curveball going, I'm going to get some strikeouts on it. But I'm not going to say I'm a power pitcher."	Backed by three RBIs apiece from Soriano and Geovany Soto, who also homered, Lilly (4-4) allowed four runs and six hits in six innings. After striking out 10 against Arizona in his previous start, he fanned eight in the first four innings. He left after throwing 102 pitches on a 46-degree night.	Cubs pitchers combined to strike out 15 against the Padres, whose 308 strikeouts are second in the major leagues behind Florida's 326.	Soriano, who has three homers in as many games, is 10-for-19 over the last five games after a slow start that included a trip to the disabled list. He also had a key two-run single in the second inning after a wild pitch by Jake Peavy on a third strike to Lilly allowed the pitcher to reach. The single gave the Cubs a 3-0 lead.	"I feel great. I'm swinging the bat really well," said Soriano, who was booed early in the 10-game homestand. "That's part of the game. It motivates me to try to make myself a better player."	Peavy (4-3) needed 87 pitches to make it through four innings. He gave up four runs and seven hits, struck out eight and walked two.	The wild pitch was costly.	"It would have been a different game. I still had the chance to make some pitches to Soriano there," Peavy said. "I'd much rather get Ted Lilly out there than have to face Soriano, but I didn't. I have to make better pitches. I'm obviously just frustrated. I have to do better than that. Having to get pulled after four is embarrassing."	Manager Bud Black said Peavy's pitch count got high in a short amount of time. He decided to pinch-hit for his standout starter in the fifth with two on	"Jake's stuff was OK. The slider was effective. You saw that he had eight strikeouts. The fastball command was probably not Jake-like," Black said. "It doesn't happen often. I think over the last couple of years, he has the most quality starts of anybody. This guy is one of the best pitchers in the game, so it's a rare occurrence."	Soto's RBI single in the third made it 4-0, but San Diego closed within a run in the fifth on Tadahito Iguchi's two-run single and Lilly's wild pitch.	Soto's seventh homer, a two-run drive off Wilfredo Ledezma, put Chicago up 6-3 in the fifth. Khalil Greene's sacrifice fly cut the margin, but Aramis Ramirez had an RBI double in the sixth and Johnson a run-scoring double an inning later off Bryan Corney to make it 8-4.	Iguchi hit a bases-loaded single off Kerry Wood with two outs in the ninth before Brian Giles flied out.	Game notes	 It was Peavy's shortest outing since going four innings against Arizona last Sept. 5. ... Soriano has 46 career leadoff homers, third in major league history behind Rickey Henderson (81) and Craig Biggio (53). He has homered in three straight games. ... Peavy made a nice diving catch of Soriano's pop in the fourth. ... Lilly has 12 double-digit strikeout games overall.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Luke Hochevar is finally beginning to demonstrate why the Kansas City Royals selected him first overall in the 2006 draft.	Hochevar pitched six strong innings and Joey Gathright drove in the only runs, helping the Kansas City Royals beat the Detroit Tigers 2-0 on Wednesday night and hand Justin Verlander his American League-leading seventh loss.	Hochevar (3-2) limited the Tigers to four singles while striking out five and walking three. He lowered his earned run average to 3.94 in five starts since being called up from Triple-A Omaha on April 20.	"I'm learning a lot," said the 24-year-old right-hander. "I learned a lot tonight and saw a lot of things that will help me in my next start. You learn how to win in the big leagues. I'm surrounded with a lot of winners. I know every guy on the team is a winner.	"A lot of it is sitting back and watching a lot of these guys do what they do really well. I learn a lot from just watching these guys compete and play hard and do the little things. Every time out I'm feeling more and more comfortable."	Relievers Ron Mahay, Leo Nunez and Joakim Soria completed the shutout, holding the Tigers to two hits over the final three innings. Soria picked up his 10th save in as many chances with a perfect ninth, and has not allowed a run in 16 1/3 innings in 17 appearances this season. He's allowed just four hits while striking out 18 and walking one.	"I'm happy to hand the ball over to anybody in the bullpen and know they are going to do a quality job," Hochevar said.	It hasn't been just about the bullpen, though. Hochevar already sounds like a veteran, giving thanks for the reliable defense provided by the guys backing him up.	"That's such a big thing that people don't look at," he said. "When I take the mound, I know we have a great defense and it takes a lot of pressure off of you. I'm just trying to induce contact because I know they are going to make good plays. It makes my job a lot easier."	Verlander (1-7) lost for the first time in 10 career starts against the Royals. He had been 6-0 with a 2.65 ERA against Kansas City and put in another solid performance, leaving after six-plus innings. Verlander allowed just two runs on six hits -- five of them singles -- with three walks and three strikeouts.	"It's tough to win," said Verlander, who has lost more games than he did last year when he was 18-6. "When we score we don't pitch, and when we pitch we don't hit."	The Tigers, last in the AL Central, have lost nine of 11.	"We swung at a lot of bad balls," Tigers manager Jim Leyland said. "Verlander did fine, held them to two runs. We have had all the combinations that lead to losing instead of winning. Things aren't going against us; we're not making good things happen."	The Royals loaded the bases with one out in the second, and Gathright hit an opposite field single on a 2-2 pitch to score Mark Teahen and John Buck. It was Gathright's first multi-RBI game since June 24, 2007, at Milwaukee.	"It worked out," Gathright said. "That's getting it done. He made some good pitches. He was tough. He tried to bury his slider and it was up a little bit. I stayed inside of it and went to left."	The Royals, who are 5-0 against the Tigers this season, won for the 11th time in which they scored four or fewer runs. It was the fifth shutout logged by the Kansas City pitching staff.	The Tigers' best scoring opportunity came in the third when they put Curtis Granderson on second and Ivan Rodriguez on third, but Carlos Guillen popped up foul to third baseman Alex Gordon to end the threat.	The only other Tiger to reach third was Placido Polanco in the eighth, but he was stranded when Miguel Cabrera grounded out.	The Royals loaded the bases in the seventh but failed to score, with Jose Guillen's ground out ending the inning.	Game notes	 Royals SS Tony Pena Jr. walked in the second inning for the first time in 42 at-bats. Not counting an intentional walk on April 25, it was his first walk in 85 at-bats, since April 8. "We walk Pena on four pitches and it's tough to walk Pena," Leyland said.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Toronto Blue Jays are starting to catch some breaks.	Matt Stairs hit a grand slam and Roy Halladay rebounded from a shaky start to help the Blue Jays beat the Twins 6-5.	"You got to get some breaks. There's no questions about that," said Toronto manager John Gibbons, whose team took advantage of several Twins' miscues for the second straight night. "More importantly, you need to take advantage of them."	Halladay (4-5) has been the victim of poor run support all season, getting only 3.14 runs per outing entering Wednesday. Stairs' slam in the first inning gave the right-hander a 4-0 advantage, but it wasn't enough.	The Twins answered back as Justin Morneau hit his seventh homer of the season in the bottom of the first to make it 4-2 and Jason Kubel added an RBI double to make it 4-3.	Michael Cuddyer's RBI groundout tied it in the third.	Toronto regained the lead on Brad Wilkerson's RBI single in the fourth off Boof Bonser (2-5).	Leading 5-4 in the eighth, Toronto added an insurance run on reliever Jesse Crain's throwing error. Crain had Scott Rolen picked off of second base, but overthrew third base and allowed Rolen to score.	The play was no laughing matter for Twins manager Ron Gardenhire, who watched his team also give away Tuesday's game with sloppy play.	In addition to Crain's blunder, Carlos Gomez was thrown out trying to advance to third on a comebacker to the pitcher and Delmon Young was picked off first after a single to right field.	"It happens. We're not immune to it," Gardenhire said. "We work on a lot of things and it happens. You saw last night where we gave away two or three runs and we lose 5-3. Tonight, we give them an extra one and we end up losing by one, there you have it. You don't give people extra outs. We've said that around here forever."	Bonser has allowed 17 runs in his last three starts and has twice allowed four or more runs in the first inning.	"It's brutal. We put up a bunch of runs off their ace, and I can't go out and shut them down," Bonser said. "That grand slam, I don't want to say it killed me, but it gives them a 4-0 lead right out of the gate, which isn't fun. Especially for my teammates to have to come up and put up a bunch of runs. It's very frustrating."	With the Twins' loss and Cleveland's victory, Minnesota dropped out of first place in the AL Central.	Wilkerson and Aaron Hill led off the game with singles and Scott Rolen coaxed a walk after an 11-pitch at-bat to load the bases.	Rolen walked after a 15-pitch at-bat during the sixth inning of Tuesday's game and Stairs followed with a home run.	Stairs sent the first pitch he saw after Rolen's most recent marathon at-bat into the first row of the upper deck in right field for his first grand slam since May 19 of last season and the 11th of his career.	"Scotty had a great at-bat before me," Stairs said. "[Bonser] was trying to go fastball away and I think he missed his spot. I just happened to put a good swing on it and barrell it."	Halladay pitched 6 2/3 innings, allowing four runs and nine hits. He struck out eight.	"It would've been nice to keep it 4-0 the whole time, but you have those where you've got to grind through," Halladay said. "You know they're not going to give up in the first inning."	Minnesota closed to within one on an RBI double by Kubel. Brian Tallet struck out pinch-hitter Brendan Harris to end the threat and strand Kubel on third.	Scott Downs pitched the ninth for his fifth save in six chances.	Game notes	 The Twins have lost five in a row to Toronto for the first time since August of 1998 and have been outscored 37-13. ... The four-run first inning marked the first time since April 20 that Toronto has scored four or more times in an inning.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Rick Ankiel added a home run-robbing catch to his collection of jaw-dropping defensive plays, earning an assist in Todd Wellemeyer's most dominating start.	Wellemeyer allowed two hits into the eighth inning and Albert Pujols had two hits, reaching base for the 41st straight game to start the season, helping the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 5-1 on Wednesday night.	The most spectacular play belonged to Ankiel, in his first full season as the starting center fielder after flaming out as a wild left-handed pitcher. He leaped above the wall to deny Adam LaRoche of a home run in the second inning.	"That helped me out a lot," Wellemeyer said. "That was huge. Huge."	Last week, Ankiel made two impressive throws to third base for assists. Responding to a question comparing the catch to Jim Edmonds' wall-climbing heroics over the years, Ankiel smiled and agreed it was a "little Jim Edmondsesque out there."	For good measure, Ankiel tacked on a strong, unnecessary throw to the infield that nearly struck LaRoche as he was heading back to the dugout. Ankiel said he thought the throw had hit LaRoche on a bounce and apologized to the Pirates' first baseman after singling in the sixth.	"I was like 'Sorry for hitting you.' He was like 'Yeah, that's what my feelings are hurt about," Ankiel said.	Cesar Izturis and Troy Glaus both had three hits and an RBI for the Cardinals, who ended a three-game losing streak and won for only the second time in eight games behind a 15-hit attack. They stranded 15 runners, one off their season worst and their most in a regulation game. They handed the Pirates only their second loss in nine games, denying them a chance to reach .500 this far into the season for the first time since they were 30-30 on June 11, 2005.	Before the game, manager John Russell said .500 was not a level the Pirates aspired to.	"You pick .500 as a goal, where do you go from there?" Russell said. "I don't think that's anything we're going to pop a champagne bottle over."	Wellemeyer (4-1) allowed Luis Rivas' single with one out in the first, then gave up only three walks before Jose Bautista singled to start the eighth. Wellemeyer has worked seven innings twice but this was the first time he pitched in the eighth in a career spent as a reliever before last season.	Wellemeyer said improved concentration has helped him last longer in games, and in this outing get by with less than his best stuff.	"You can get out there and start thinking too many things," Wellemeyer said. "You've got to let your body work and quiet your mind down."	Pujols singled twice, drew his major league-leading 12th intentional walk in the fourth after Ankiel's two-out double and had the first of consecutive sacrifice flies off Paul Maholm (2-4) in the sixth that put the Cardinals ahead 4-0. His streak of reaching base is the best in the majors to start the season since Derek Jeter's 53-game run in 1999 for the Yankees. Pujols extended his second double-digit hitting streak of the year to 13 games.	Maholm allowed four runs and 11 hits in six innings with three walks and six strikeouts, keeping the Pirates close by stranding 10 runners. The Cardinals left the bases loaded in the third, getting only Glaus' RBI double for a 2-0 lead, and left two on in the second and fourth.	"If a guy gets on I'm not really worried about it because I know I can get a sinker and get a weak pop-up," Maholm said. "There were probably three or four hits that didn't even make it out of the infield and a couple that just blooped over."	All four of Maholm's losses have come on the road. At home, he's 2-0 with a 2.05 ERA.	"If I'd come out and not thrown really well, then I'd try and figure out what was going on," Maholm said. "But I felt confident that I was going to get every pitch over for strikes.	"For me, it was a positive, but I'd much rather have the win and the team have the win."	The Cardinals left the bases loaded again in a scoreless seventh against Sean Burnett and have left 364 runners on base in the first 42 games, by far the most in the majors.	The Pirates scored in the eighth when Izturis, the shortstop, fell down while backpedaling for Nate McLouth's two-out pop fly against Randy Flores. The ball dropped next to him in shallow center field for an RBI single.	Jason Isringhausen, removed from the closer's role last week after five blown saves, worked a 1-2-3 ninth.	Game notes	 The Cardinals' run of homering in eight straight games ended. ... Pujols is 5-for-11 against Maholm with a homer, three RBIs and four walks. He's batting .333 (15-for-45) during his hitting streak. ... Wellemeyer is 4-1 with a 2.70 ERA in five starts at home. ... Glaus has RBIs in consecutive games after going 12 games without one.

PHOENIX (AP) -- Micah Owings has made headlines with his bat.	He can pitch too.	Owings threw six shutout innings as the Arizona Diamondbacks defeated the Colorado Rockies 4-3 on Wednesday night, extending their domination of the defending NL champions.	"He's becoming a more complete pitcher, spinning the ball pretty aggressively," Colorado manager Clint Hurdle said. "We were able to extend some counts and work his pitch count up, but he was out there battling."	The only downside for Owings: he went 0-for-3 to drop his batting average 47 points, to .370. He was called out on a grounder to third base despite appearing to beat the throw in the sixth.	"No comment," Owings said.	Brandon Lyon earned his 10th straight save and Orlando Hudson hit a two-run double for the Diamondbacks, who have won seven of eight games against Colorado this season after being swept by the Rockies in the NL Championship Series last fall.	The Diamondbacks improved to a major league-best 25-15 -- including 19-5 against the feeble NL West -- and dropped the Rockies 10 games back in the division race.	"We've got to see them about a hundred more times, so it's going to come down to the wire," Hudson said.	Bad news for the Rockies: they'll face 8-0 Brandon Webb as they try to avoid a three-game sweep on Thursday night.	"This season is a long season, and that's one thing to put in perspective and realize you can't play three months of baseball in one at-bat, one pitch or one play," Colorado right fielder Brad Hawpe said. "You're going to have times when things are going easy and you're going to have times when they are tough. So with that being said, things are going tough."	Hawpe had a chance to tie the game in the ninth after Lyon gave up two-out singles to Todd Helton and Garrett Atkins. But Lyon retired Hawpe on a pop to third base to earn his 11th save in 13 chances.	Lyon had blown a save in a 5-2 victory at Colorado on April 6, and that may have been going through the Diamondbacks' minds as the Rockies mounted their late rally.	"It was a no doubter," Arizona manager Bob Melvin said with a smile. "It was in the bag. Felt good about it. Helton, and [Matt] Holliday, and Hawpe and those guys, they've never hurt us before. Lyon made big pitches, though."	Arizona's latest victory came while Owings (5-1) limited the Rockies to five hits in six innings, with two walks and five strikeouts. Melvin lifted him after 100 pitches.	"He was spent," Melvin said. "He was losing his command a little bit there right at the end with 100 pitches. But typical Micah -- he has to make a pitch, he does."	Owings had a 4-0 lead when he left but had to sweat out the victory when the normally reliable Arizona bullpen faltered.	The Rockies broke through in the seventh against Chad Qualls, cutting the deficit to 4-1 on a single by Ryan Spilborghs.	Colorado pulled to within 4-3 in the eighth on a two-run pinch single by Scott Podsednik off Tony Pena. One of the runs was charged to Doug Slaten, who gave up a leadoff single to Helton to start the rally.	Owings won his first four starts but had gone winless in his last three, allowing 14 earned runs in 17 2/3 innings.	It looked as if the Rockies would extend Owings' slump on an 84-degree evening in the desert. He walked leadoff man Spilborghs, gave up a double Holliday and walked Helton to load the bases with one out.	"Early on, I definitely didn't feel good," Owings said. "I wasn't really in sync. I just tried to fight through it."	But Owings struck out Atkins and retired Hawpe on a grounder to second to end the threat.	Rockies starter Jorge De La Rosa (1-2), a former Diamondbacks farmhand, allowed one hit over the first three innings before running into trouble in the fourth. Singles by Stephen Drew, Hudson and Conor Jackson gave Arizona a 1-0 lead.	The Rockies walked Justin Upton intentionally to load the bases for slumping Eric Byrnes, who bounced into a 6-4-3 double play to make it 2-0.	The Diamondbacks made it 4-0 on Hudson's two-run double in the fifth -- an inning that ended with Byrnes grounding to short to leave the bases loaded. Byrnes went 0-for-4 to drop his average to .214.	Game notes	 Arizona LHP Randy Johnson iced his pitching hand on Wednesday, one day after trying to catch a bouncer barehanded. He said he expects to make his scheduled start Sunday. "It's the smart pitchers that pull their hand back," Johnson said. "It's the dumb ones that leave it out there." ... ... Atkins has hit in 12 straight games. ... De La Rosa was signed by the Diamondbacks on March 20, 1998, 11 days before their first game. ... Colorado RHP Aaron Cook will go after his seventh straight victory in the series finale Thursday night. Cook (6-1) has a 1.90 ERA during his six-game win streak, which includes a victory over Arizona on April 13.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Carlos Quentin did what he does every day -- checked the lineup card to see if he was playing. This time, he was batting third for the first time this season.	Quentin made White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen look smart when he broke an eighth-inning tie with his first career grand slam in Chicago's 6-1 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Wednesday night.	He also matched his career high with five RBIs and helped spoil John Lackey's long-awaited return to the Angels' rotation.	A.J. Pierzynski hit second -- one of five players who batted in an unfamiliar slot for the first time this season. The others were Jim Thome (fifth), Paul Konerko (sixth) and Nick Swisher (eighth). Thome came in hitting .209, Konerko .213 and Swisher .206.	"You hit where you hit and you move on. I mean, you can't really try to overthink it," Pierzynski said. "The two hole is probably the highest I've ever hit. It's something different. Ozzie shook it up and it worked, so I'm sure we'll probably have the same one tomorrow."	Guillen started the same nine batters as he did in the first two games of this four-game series, but only leadoff man Orlando Cabrera and No. 9 hitter Juan Uribe stayed put in Wednesday's heavily shuffled lineup as Guillen tried to generate more offense.	"I wanted to try and take advantage of the guys who are swinging the bat well right now. That's the main thing," Guillen said. "I think the guys who aren't swinging the bats are pressing. Hopefully, shuffling the lineup will help and we'll get back to normal pretty soon and this lineup won't be this way for long. I want to get my regular lineup back to normal."	Jose Contreras (4-3) allowed a run and four hits in seven innings with three strikeouts and three walks. The right-hander, who held Seattle to one run over seven innings in a 4-2 victory last Friday, has won consecutive starts for the first time since Sept. 19, 2007. Contreras won a franchise-record 17 consecutive decisions from Aug. 21, 2005 through July 4, 2006.	"I felt great. My forkball was excellent and I was throwing my fastball to both sides of the plate," Contreras said through a translator. "I felt under control with all my pitches pretty much the whole game."	Uribe led off the eighth with a single against Scot Shields (2-1), and took third when shortstop Erick Aybar went deep in the hole for Cabrera's infield single and threw the ball past first base for his sixth error. Shields walked Pierzynski with first base open, and Quentin drove a 2-0 fastball to left-center for his AL-leading 10th home run.	"We know he's a quality set-up man -- and with the stuff he has, he's almost considered like a closer," Quentin said. "He has a very good slider, so I was definitely aware of that. He came at me early in the count with fastballs and he missed. I was just thinking about keeping the ball up the middle, having a quality at-bat and at least make sure I get one in."	The home run was the second Shields allowed this season. The bullpen has surrendered 14, including the one Swisher hit against Jose Arredondo in the ninth inning on the right-hander's third pitch in the major leagues.	"You've just got to shake it off," Shields said. "Lackey pitched a pretty good game. For me to get out there, not get anybody out, and give up four runs, it hurts inside."	Lackey threw 99 pitches over seven innings, allowing a run and six hits while striking out four and walking one. The All-Star right-hander retired 14 of 15 batters during one stretch and allowed just two hits after Konerko's leadoff single in the second inning.	Konerko's bid for a possible tiebreaking RBI double in the seventh was caught on the warning track by seven-time Gold Glove center fielder Torii Hunter, who made an over-the-shoulder grab. Jermaine Dye was held up at third on Joe Crede's double to right-center, and Swisher flied out as Lackey let out an exuberant yell and punched the air with his fist.	"It was nice to be back. It's been a long road," Lackey said. "I felt pretty good early on. I was able to throw off-speed stuff for strikes, and that was a big key. My fastball is not all the way back. That's probably going to take a few games, but it was a good start."	Lackey, who had never been on the disabled list during his six previous major league seasons, was sidelined since March 21 because of a strained triceps. Last season he finished third in the AL Cy Young voting with a career-best 19-9 record and led the league with a 3.01 ERA.	Lackey gave up singles to his first three batters, including a run-scoring hit by Quentin. The Angels tied it in the fifth when Izturis drew a leadoff walk, stole second, advanced on Robb Quinlan's single and scored on Mike Napoli's sacrifice fly.	Game notes	 Quentin's other 5-RBI game in the majors was on May 21, 2007 against Colorado while he was playing for Arizona. ... Swisher was 0-for-3 against Lackey and has just four hits in 37 career at-bats against him.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Miguel Tejada understands why Houston manager Cecil Cooper wants to give him a day off. The Astros' durable shortstop just doesn't want to come out of the lineup.	The only Houston player to start the first 41 games this season, Tejada had three hits, including the go-ahead single in the seventh, in the Astros' 6-3 victory over the San Francisco Giants on Wednesday night.	Cooper said he first approached Tejada about taking a day off two weeks ago. Tejada, who played in 1,152 consecutive games before going on the disabled list last June while still with Baltimore, finally relented -- but only after what Cooper said was "a little arm-twisting."	"It's good sometimes to take a day off," said Tejada, who plans to sit Thursday. "We have a long road trip and we're going to play 20 games in 21 days. We're going to test it. But I'm going to be ready just in case."	Lance Berkman hit his 14th home run of the season, a two-run shot off San Francisco starter Pat Misch in the first, to extend his hitting streak to 13 games. It also tied Berkman with Philadelphia's Chase Utley for the major league lead in homers.	San Francisco's Aaron Rowand homered off Houston starter Brian Moehler, but the Giants failed to capitalize against six Astros relievers, stranding runners at third base in the second, third, fifth, sixth and seventh innings.	"We couldn't cash in our opportunities and it came back to haunt us," a solemn San Francisco manager Bruce Bochy said. "We couldn't get that extra hit or sacrifice fly. Tonight wasn't a good night for us."	Hunter Pence added a pair of hits for the Astros, who have won 10 of their last 12.	Oscar Villarreal (1-3) pitched a third of an inning to get the win, while Jose Valverde worked the ninth for his 10th save in 13 tries.	"Every button we pushed, everybody came out of the 'pen and did their jobs," Cooper said. "That's how we have to do it. We all have to chip in."	Jack Taschner (2-1) took the loss for San Francisco.	The Astros jumped on Misch for three runs in the first inning but couldn't get much going after that, until Tejada's run-scoring single off Sadler in the seventh.	"I knew he was going to get a hit there," Cooper said. "You don't throw fastballs by that guy two or three times in a row. I actually said he was trying to sneak some cheese by the rat, and you don't sneak cheese by guys that hit the fastball."	Brad Ausmus added a two-run homer in the eighth as Houston improved to 16-6 since April 21.	Misch, winless in seven career starts, pitched well enough but couldn't overcome his early struggles. San Francisco's lefty retired 13 of 16 at one point before leaving after six innings. He gave up seven hits with a season-high six strikeouts.	"I didn't feel great in the first inning," Misch said. "After they stung me for three [runs] I had to get locked in to keep it there."	San Francisco tagged Moehler for four straight hits to open the second, including Rowand's team-leading fifth homer. Rowand's two-run blast down the left field line cut the Astros' lead to 3-2 before Moehler made a wild throw home on Misch's sacrifice bunt, allowing John Bowker to score the tying run.	The game was stopped briefly in the sixth when Astros left-fielder Carlos Lee injured himself diving for Jose Castillo's double. Lee hit the turf hard but quickly got up, retrieved the ball and threw it to the infield before kneeling in the outfield as team trainers rushed out. After getting his left forearm wrapped up, Lee remained in the game.	Game notes	 Berkman is hitting .560 (28-for50) during his streak. ... Misch's RBI in the second was the first of his career. ... Astros 3B Ty Wigginton is expected to return to the lineup Friday and is available on an emergency basis until then. ... LHP Wandy Rodriguez could rejoin the Astros rotation Wednesday in Chicago. ... San Francisco RHP Kevin Correia, sidelined with a strained left side muscle, threw 10 pitches off a mound without pain.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

CLEVELAND (AP) -- It wasn't even a bad pitch that ended the Cleveland Indians' scoreless streak.	An unearned run against Aaron Laffey on his own throwing error halted the starting rotation's run of 44 1/3 consecutive shutout innings, but didn't interrupt their string of dominant outings.	Laffey pitched the Indians to a 4-2 victory over the Oakland Athletics on Thursday, completing a three-game sweep and giving the surging Indians eight victories in 10 games.	"When you talk about five guys	-- to do it day in and day out it's impressive," Laffey said. "It's just been an incredible week of starting pitching for us."	Cleveland completed a 6-1 homestand in which it allowed runs in just four of 64 innings. The starters went 6-0 with a 0.16 ERA and haven't allowed an earned run in 50 1/3 innings.	In the rotation because of an injury to Jake Westbrook, Laffey (2-2) allowed just the unearned run and five hits in seven innings, struck out six and walked one. He lowered his ERA to 1.35 and has gone seven innings in each of his last three starts without giving up an earned run.	Cleveland's scoreless streak, which began last Friday, ended in the second when Laffey charged Rob Bowen's weak grounder and threw it into right field, allowing Bobby Crosby to score from second.	"When it's an error like, that it's kind of disappointing, especially to break a streak like that," Laffey said. "I had a lot more time than I thought I did. I just kind of rushed and let go of the ball too early. It went flying; I almost threw it to second base."	The streak was the longest by Cleveland's starters since Bob Lemon, Gene Bearden, Sam Zoldak and Satchel Paige strung together 47 scoreless innings in August 1948 -- all threw complete game shutouts. It was the longest by a major league team in one season since a 54-inning streak by Baltimore's starters from Sept. 1-7, 1974, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.	Jhonny Peralta homered for the Indians, who on Wednesday moved into the AL Central lead for the first time since the opening week of the season.	Oakland has lost five of six after winning four straight.	"We've run into some pitching," A's manager Bob Geren said. "We've played good defense and pitched very well. We just haven't scored any runs."	The A's loaded the bases with one out in the ninth against Rafael Betancourt. Masa Kobayashi relieved and threw a run-scoring wild pitch, then struck out pinch-hitter Mike Sweeney, who pumped a fist in frustration. Kobayashi then fanned pinch-hitter Ryan Sweeney for his second save in two chances.	Indians manager Eric Wedge pulled Betancourt because he was having trouble with his location. Betancourt gave up three runs Tuesday against Toronto and took the Indians' only loss during the homestand.	Wedge said he hadn't yet thought about whether Kobayashi, who had 227 saves in nine seasons in Japan, would replace Betancourt as Cleveland's closer.	Rookie Greg Smith (2-3) gave up three runs, seven hits and three walks in 4 2/3 innings, striking out seven. He has lost three straight decisions.	"I was inconsistent. The fastball would locate sometimes, other times it wasn't there," Smith said. "The next thing I know I am at 100 pitches."	Ryan Garko's RBI double in the first was offset by the unearned run, which ended a streak of 24 scoreless innings for the A's in Cleveland.	Ben Francisco and Travis Hafner put Cleveland ahead 3-1 with RBI singles in the third, and Peralta homered in the seventh off Santiago Casilla, who left after facing only one batter. Casilla has a strain in his elbow area and will be checked out Friday in Atlanta, Geren said.	Game notes	 The Indians won the season series 5-4. ... A's 2B Mark Ellis remains day to day with a strained left hamstring. ... Hafner got his seventh career stolen base in the fifth inning. ... The Indians, who have played 17 of their last 20 games at home, go on road for six games against Cincinnati and the Chicago White Sox. ... Thursday was the 27th anniversary of Len Barker's perfect game for Cleveland. ... The American flag flew at half-staff in recognition of National Peace Officer's Memorial Day. ... About 8,000 children from 100 schools were in attendance.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MILWAUKEE (AP) -- With third baseman Blake DeWitt sidelined because of an aching lower back, Dodgers coach Larry Bowa suggested to manager Joe Torre just before the game that he play Chin-Lung Hu as a fill-in.	Torre tossed aside the advice of his friend and decided instead to start backup catcher Gary Bennett, who hadn't played in more than a week.	Bennett hit a three-run homer, and Andruw Jones and Jeff Kent added solo shots during a six-run seventh inning to lead Chad Billingsley and the Los Angeles Dodgers over the Milwaukee Brewers 7-2 Thursday.	"Great suggestion, obviously," Torre deadpanned.	Bennett also added an RBI double in the ninth in his first action since May 7, while regular catcher Russell Martin played third base for the fifth time in his career. Nomar Garciaparra is still on the disabled list.	"Even when you're not playing, you still come in and get your work done. It's not like if you're not playing, you just sit on the couch and do nothing," said Bennett, who was told 15 minutes before the game that he would start. "You still get your work for situations just like that. You never know, one foul tip in the first inning and you can end up in the game. I just always try to stay as ready as I can."	Billingsley (3-5) didn't allow a hit until Brewers starter Ben Sheets, a career .078 hitter, singled with two outs in the fifth.	Billingsley gave up three hits and struck out five. The 23-year-old right-hander was pulled with a 6-0 lead after giving up Jason Kendall's leadoff triple in the eighth and walking his fourth batter.	"I just really had good command with the fastball and was able to throw it where I wanted to and keep it down in the zone," Billingsley said.	Jonathan Broxton got J.J. Hardy to ground into a double play that scored Kendall. Ryan Braun then homered -- after agreeing to an eight-year, $45 million contract with Milwaukee before the game.	"It was a hectic day," said Braun, who hit his 10th homer this season.	Still, the Dodgers showed most of the power. After coming in tied for last in the NL with 26 homers, Los Angeles jumped on Sheets (4-1) with a surge in the seventh.	"I'm sure it looked baffling," said Sheets, who dismissed any physical problems. "I would say that's probably my worst inning ever, personally. I don't know if it statistically is. But it wasn't a good inning."	Jones, hitting .182, turned on a high fastball for a solo homer to lead off the inning, his second homer and seventh RBI this season. After an out, Sheets hung a breaking ball and Kent made it 2-0.	"He made a mistake and I was able to take advantage of it," Jones said. "In that inning all of sudden, he started throwing balls up and we were able to hit him."	Sheets then came unraveled. James Loney tripled and scored on Martin's single. Luis Maza's first career hit put runners at the corners with one out and set up Bennett's homer, the 22nd of his 13-year career.	Sheets was finished after Bennett's homer, allowing six runs and nine hits. He had five strikeouts in 6 1/3 innings after starting 4-0 for the first time in his career.	"Runs are like gold when you are talking about Ben Sheets. He was pitching so well and then to get the three-run homer, that was huge," Torre said. "If you go out there and control the game with your starting pitching, it gives you a chance to do things. You can think small and all of a sudden, you throw up a six spot."	Game notes	 The Brewers put RHP David Riske (hyperextended right elbow) on the 15-day DL and purchased the contract of journeyman minor league pitcher Mark DiFelice. DiFelice has never pitched in the majors, spending 11 years in the minors. ... Torre chatted with Bobby Thomson in the Brewers dugout before the game. Thomson, famous for the 1951 NL pennant-winning homer, was in town as part of a celebration of the Milwaukee Braves. Thomson played for the Braves from 1954-57, while Torre started his career with the Braves in 1960.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK (AP) -- Jason Bergmann never got a chance to plead his case to stay in the game after seven shutout innings.	No matter. The pinch hitter who replaced him made Bergmann a winner.	Willie Harris helped put Washington ahead with a key sacrifice bunt, then saved the slick-fielding Nationals by making a sensational catch in the ninth inning of Thursday's 1-0 victory over the New York Mets.	"Willie proved to be the deciding factor in this game, didn't he?" said Bergmann, who was called up from Triple-A Columbus before the game and earned his first victory since September.	The Mets got another chance to tie the score after Harris' grab, putting a runner on third with one out. Instead, they had a potential rally end on an unusual double play for the second consecutive inning.	Washington took three of four in the series by winning an unlikely pitching duel between Bergmann and Mike Pelfrey. The Mets finished a sour 3-4 on their seven-game homestead against last-place teams.	All-Star closer Billy Wagner, who criticized his teammates earlier this season, snapped to reporters after the game, "You should be talking to the guys over there.	"Oh, they're not there. Big shock."	Pelfrey carried a no-hit bid into the seventh before Aaron Boone broke it up with a leadoff single. Starting at first base in place of injured Nick Johnson, Boone also had two crucial assists on those late double plays.	"We're blessed to have him over here," manager Manny Acta said. "He's such a professional player."	Carlos Beltran singled leading off the ninth against Jon Rauch, who earned his ninth save. Ryan Church then hit a high fly down the left-field line that sliced away from the speedy Harris, who was shading Church toward left-center.	"I got a good read on it," Harris said. "I had no idea that I was going to catch it. I just ran after it as if I was going to catch it. ... The ball stayed up in the air long enough."	Harris laid out for a diving catch to thwart the Mets yet again. With the Braves last August, he made a leaping catch to rob Carlos Delgado of a potential tying home run in the ninth inning of a 7-6 Atlanta victory.	Moments after his play Thursday, though, the Nationals' defense betrayed them. Beltran stole second and advanced to third on catcher Jesus Flores' throwing error.	The Mets' good fortune abandoned them as quickly as it had arrived, however. Delgado hit a low liner to first, and Beltran, running on contact, was easily doubled off by Boone.	The game's lone run came in the eighth. Flores led off with a double, Harris laid down his bunt and Felipe Lopez hit a sacrifice fly.	Jose Reyes opened the bottom half with a bunt single. Luis Castillo then laid down a perfect sacrifice, and Reyes, noticing that nobody was covering third, tried to take an extra base.	But shortstop Cristian Guzman recovered in time, catching Boone's throw on the run and beating Reyes to the bag. The two collided as Reyes was tagged out on a 5-3-6 double play.	"He was able to make the first reception of his career," Boone joked, "and I completed the first pass of my career."	Said Reyes: "I thought I could make it. They made a perfect throw. That's the key."	Pelfrey (2-4) allowed one run and three hits in 7 2/3 winnings, the longest outing of his career, and left to a standing ovation. But he was outdone by Bergmann (1-1), who hadn't started in the majors since April 9 and came in with an 11.68 ERA. Bergmann gave up three hits and struck out nine, one shy of his career high.	It was only the second time in 31 career starts that Bergmann didn't allow a run.	"I was able to throw sliders over early; I was able to throw curveballs over late," Bergmann said.	Game notes	 Johnson was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a torn tendon sheath in his right wrist. The Nationals plan to activate 1B Dmitri Young from the DL on Friday. ... Washington has four shutouts this season, which ties them with the Marlins and Giants for the NL lead. ... It was the Mets' first 1-0 loss since May 17, 2006, at St. Louis. They were shut out for the first time this season. ... Castillo returned after missing three games with a strained left quadriceps. ... Mets reliever Scott Schoeneweis felt better after spending much of Wednesday in the hospital with stomach pain.

ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Jason Bay's first pinch-hit homer delivered the latest jolt of anguish to Jason Isringhausen.	Bay's three-run shot off the St. Louis Cardinals' struggling reliever, working the eighth inning instead of the ninth, was the go-ahead blow in the Pittsburgh Pirates' rally from an early four-run deficit in an 11-5 victory Thursday. It also brought manager Tony La Russa's fear to fruition -- you can't hide anyone for long in the bullpen.	"Right now, he's problem No. 1," La Russa said. "He's beside himself, puzzled, the whole thing."	Isringhausen, saddled with an 8.00 ERA and six blown saves in 17 chances, seemed to think he wouldn't be part of the bullpen for this weekend's interleague series against the Rays. He reiterated that the problem is not physical, so that would leave a minor league demotion or an outright release as options if the Cardinals have lost patience with him.	"I'm out of answers, out of excuses so to speak," Isringhausen said. "We've just got to go to the next step, whatever that might be. I expect probably an answer tomorrow when we get here or even tonight, I don't know."	Nate McLouth added his 11th homer for the Pirates, who outscored the sagging Cardinals 10-0 the last five innings to take two of three in the series. The finale was played in 56-degree chill accompanied by steady rain throughout the comeback, with nearly 10,000 no-shows in paid attendance of 41,244.	"We know we're in the game until it's over," Pirates manager John Russell said. "Our pitching gives us the opportunity to score late in the game."	Bay, who has started all but two of the Pirates' 41 games, had a feeling he might get a partial day off after Pittsburgh closed the deficit to a run in the fifth. He would have been happy with a sacrifice fly with runners on second and third, but got a pitch that probably caught more of the plate than Isringhausen wanted.	"I fully anticipated getting in at some point," Bay said. "I wasn't expecting to do that. When it went out, I was like, 'Wow!' "	Troy Glaus had three hits and an RBI, and Albert Pujols extended his hitting streak to 14 games for the Cardinals, who failed to put the game away against Ian Snell. St. Louis had 11 hits during Snell's four-inning stint but only a 5-1 lead while stranding eight runners.	The Cardinals stranded 13 runners a day after leaving 15 on -- one off their season high -- in a 5-1 victory. They lead the major leagues in runners left on, and have lost seven of nine.	Isringhausen (1-5) was demoted from the closer's role last week and had been serving as the setup man for Ryan Franklin for a variety of reasons. Mike Parisi was held back in case Kyle Lohse, who skipped his bullpen session on Thursday due to shoulder soreness, can't make his next start on Sunday. Russ Springer pitched the previous two days and La Russa went to his bullpen early after Joel Pineiro faltered in the fifth. The manager had already used Kyle McClellan and Randy Flores.	"If we're playing games with a chance to win, the guys in the bullpen are all important," La Russa said. "If you have games that are getting away from you, it's different.	"You can only do so much not to use Izzy in a situation."	Bay is 2-for-11 with a pair of homers against Isringhausen and 2-for-12 for his career as a pinch hitter after lofting his eighth homer, and the first pinch-hit shot of his career, just beyond the left-field wall and out of the grasp of a staggering Chris Duncan on a 1-2 pitch for an 8-5 lead.	"I hit one way better than that last night," Bay said. "You take what you can get."	Isringhausen's throwing error on a bunt, a wild attempt to get the lead runner at third, allowed the tying run to score. The 35-year-old right-hander, who was 32-for-34 in save chances last year, lasted one-third of an inning and was charged with four runs -- three earned.	John Grabow (3-1) got two outs in the seventh for the Pirates, who nailed down their eighth victory in 10 games with three more runs in the ninth off Ron Villone.	Pujols was 2-for-5, also extending his streak of reaching base in all 42 of his games to start the season. Duncan had a two-run double in a three-run fourth that put the Cardinals ahead 5-1.	Snell, who allowed five runs in four innings, is 0-2 in his last six starts. The Pirates reduced a four-run deficit to one with a three-run fifth highlighted by Jason Michaels' two-run double off Pineiro.	Doug Mientkiewicz got a spot start for Pittsburgh and was 3-for-3 with two walks. He also scored three times.	Game notes	 Pujols is batting .340 (17-for-50) during his hitting streak, below his .357 average overall. ... Glaus has an RBI in three straight games after going 12 games without one. He was 8-for-14 in the series. ... Snell's outing was his shortest since he also lasted four innings in a road loss to the Mets on July 24, 2007.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Neither the Detroit Tigers nor the Kansas City Royals saw this sweep coming.	Jose Guillen homered and drove in three runs, Gil Meche pitched seven solid innings and the Royals beat Detroit 8-4 on Thursday to complete another three-game sweep of the Tigers.	Kansas City won its season-best fourth straight and improved to 6-0 this season against the skidding Tigers, who have lost four in a row and 10 of 12 while falling into last place in the AL Central.	"That's a question I ask, 'How we can sweep this team twice with the type of offense that they have?'" Guillen said. "That's baseball. You see some stuff you're never going to believe, but we did it."	The Royals began the year with three wins at Detroit, which opened 0-7 despite a $139 million payroll. Now, the Tigers (16-25) are struggling again.	"I think the confidence level has a lot to do with it," Royals manager Trey Hillman said about the latest sweep. "I think it has a lot to do with the fact that we went into their place to open the season and nobody was expecting us to do much of anything, except maybe score one win out of maybe the three wins. We swept that series. I don't deny I think there is some confidence that rubs off that to this series."	The Tigers have scored only 11 runs in the six losses to Kansas City.	"We're not stringing good at-bats together," manager Jim Leyland said. "Today's game, we had some good at-bats and we threw some at-bats away. I'm very surprised and disappointed in the results so far, but I'm not disappointed in the effort."	Billy Butler's two-run double keyed a three-run first against Tigers left-hander Kenny Rogers (3-4). Miguel Olivo doubled home Butler with the final run of the inning.	The Royals added two more in the second on an RBI single by Joey Gathright and Guillen's bases-loaded walk after falling behind in the count 0-2.	Guillen homered leading off the fourth against Rogers to extend his hitting streak to a season-high seven games. Olivo later doubled and scored on Mark Teahen's single.	Guillen's eighth-inning single drove in Esteban German.	Meche (3-5) yielded three runs and six hits while striking out six and walking two. He improved to 7-4 in 16 career starts against the Tigers and won for the first time this season in five home starts.	"I noticed Kenny Rogers' numbers, too, and he hasn't pitched really well, either," Meche said. "When guys are struggling and you get to them early, it just makes you break down. It's happened to me a couple of times this year. And we got some early. The next thing he's kind of nitpicking around the zone, walked some guys and we're getting good pitches to hit and we did.	"With the early run support, I know if I give up a run, I still have a five- or six-run lead. It changes everything. It was a good day to go with my fastball. If we're in a tighter game, my mind-set might have been different. We turned this homestand around, which is great. We're playing really good against Detroit," he said.	Rogers, who was 3-0 in five starts since an April 13 loss, lasted just four innings while allowing seven runs and 11 hits. Every Royals starter had at least one hit off Rogers.	"It goes to show you, you put the ball in play and good things will happen," Rogers said. "They did that and it doesn't matter if they were hard-hit or not. Frustrating as it is as I look back, the results are all that mattered. I walked the first guy of the game and that's just terrible, no doubt. Walking Gathright after having him 0-2, you can't do that, but that's the three-run inning."	Rookie Matt Joyce drove in two of the Tigers' runs. He homered leading off the seventh and hit a sacrifice fly in the second. Ramon Santiago doubled in the fifth and scored on Curtis Granderson's two-out single for Detroit's other run off Meche.	Magglio Ordonez and Carlos Guillen hit consecutive doubles in the eighth off reliever Joel Peralta for the final Tigers run.	"Jim's club has not reached their offensive stride, not even close. Their starters haven't been as consistent as their history shows they should be," Hillman said. "They're really a dangerous club. We're fortunate. I don't think we're lucky. We had some lucky hits today, but beating them six times in a row, that's an achievement that we can build on. I don't think there is anybody in our clubhouse that feels like we can throw our gloves out and beat the Detroit Tigers. We've got a lot of respect for them."	Game notes	 Meche was 0-4 with a 9.00 ERA in his first four home starts. ... Ordonez's double was the 1,700th hit of his career. ... Joyce has the last three Tigers homers in the past eight games.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO (AP) -- Ryan Dempster called Greg Maddux a mentor and showed he learned some lessons.	Dempster struck out a career-high 12 and hit a go-ahead single against Maddux during a four-run fifth inning, leading the Chicago Cubs over the punchless San Diego Padres 4-0 on Thursday.	"He's probably the greatest teammate I ever had," said Dempster, teammates with Maddux during 2½ seasons in Chicago. "Just his ability to truly go out to the mound and take it one pitch at a time, no matter what the situation, what inning it is, how many people are on base, what the score is. Just keep trying to execute pitches. That's what I've been trying to do. He really took that to its fullest."	Dempster (5-1) allowed six hits in 8 1/3 innings and walked one, leaving after 115 pitches. He retired 15 straight batters after a first-inning single by Brian Giles, who had three hits.	"He's been huge," teammate Derrek Lee said. "He's kept us in every single game he's pitched."	Dempster wasn't sure what to expect when he moved back to the rotation after spending four years in the bullpen.	"Did I think it would go this smoothly? I didn't know," he said.	He appeared set for his first complete game since a six-hitter for Cincinnati against the Cubs on Sept. 25, 2002, until he ran into trouble in the ninth.	Giles led off with a double, prompting a visit from manager Lou Piniella. Dempster struck out Adrian Gonzalez but was lifted after Kevin Kouzmanoff singled to put runners on first and third.	Kerry Wood struck out Khalil Greene and pinch-hitter Josh Bard for his eighth save in 11 chances.	Maddux, who entered the major leagues with the Cubs in 1986, made what might have been his final start at Wrigley Field. The 42-year-old might retire after this season, and the Padres are not scheduled to return to Wrigley Field this year.	Coming off his 350th win last weekend, Maddux allowed four runs and 11 hits in 4 1/3 innings. He allowed three hits in a scoreless second inning but wasn't as fortunate in the fifth.	Ronny Cedeno, Henry Blanco and Dempster singled to put the Cubs ahead. Alfonso Soriano's single loaded the bases, Ryan Theriot hit a sacrifice fly and Lee had a two-run double that chased Maddux, who left to a standing ovation.	"It was nice," Maddux said. "I appreciate it. ... It was cool. The people here are special. The fans are certainly a huge part of Wrigley Field and why this is such a great place to play. I'm sure I'll never forget it."	Jim Edmonds, released by San Diego last week, started in center for the Cubs and went 1-for-4 with a strikeout. Edmonds, who signed on Wednesday, heard cheers as he stepped to the plate in the second and again after he delivered a single to right -- something he never heard at Wrigley during his eight years with rival St. Louis. The familiar boos came during his next three at-bats, when he grounded into a double play, flied to center and struck out with the bases loaded in the seventh.	"It's definitely exciting," he said. "Being in first place, a lot is on the line every day."	Chicago won three of four from the team with the worst record in the major leagues (15-27). NL Central-leading Chicago has won six of seven overall.	San Diego batters struck out 14 times in all, a day after whiffing 15 times against Ted Lilly and the Cubs' bullpen. It was the most strikeouts in a span of two nine-inning games since Texas batters had 30 last Aug. 19 and 21, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.	The Padres, blanked for the fourth time this season, have the lowest batting average (.233) and fewest runs (140) in the major leagues.	Game notes	 Although Daryle Ward was available to pinch-hit, Piniella said Ward might be placed on the disabled list this weekend because of a bulging disc in his lower back. ... Padres catcher Michael Barrett, on the 15-day DL with a sprained ligament in his right elbow, will probably start a rehab assignment at Triple-A Portland next week, manager Bud Black said. ... Tony Clark will likely be a designated hitter when the Padres visit Seattle this weekend.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Lance Berkman is going to ride this hitting tear he's on as long as possible. Same goes for Houston manager Cecil Cooper, who continues to be amazed by his club's gutsy play.	Berkman splashed his major league-leading 15th home run into McCovey Cove to break a ninth-inning tie, helping the Astros rally past the San Francisco Giants 8-7 on Thursday for their 11th win in 13 games.	Houston already has come from behind to win 13 times this year.	"We'll take as many as we can get," Berkman said. "It seems like we're never out of it. That might be the best comeback I've seen since I've been here."	Houston rebounded from a 6-0 deficit to take three of four from the Giants, its first series win in San Francisco since a three-game sweep in September 2001. The Giants hadn't blown a six-run lead since Sept. 8, 2000, against San Diego, while the Astros came back from six runs down for the first time since May 9, 2000, vs. Colorado.	"I don't know. It's just amazing," Cooper said. "I'm hanging along for the ride. They keep doing it. They don't quit."	Berkman also hit a two-run single and is riding a 14-game hitting streak. He went 7-for-15 (.467) with three homers and seven RBIs during the series.	Pinch-hitter Darin Erstad hit a tying, three-run homer in the eighth and Carlos Lee also homered in the inning off Tyler Walker, who faltered on his 32nd birthday. Berkman connected off Vinnie Chulk (0-2) for the first splash-hit homer by an Astro and the 16th by a Giants opponent.	Barry Bonds, the indicted home run king, hit 35 into the water beyond the right-field fence.	"I mean, what a distinction, what an honor," Berkman joked about his water shot. "That's pretty big."	Tim Byrdak (2-0) got two outs for the win and Jose Valverde struck out two in a perfect ninth for his 11th save in 14 opportunities. Byrdak hasn't allowed a run in 11 outings this year.	Erstad's drive to the right-field arcade marked his first career pinch-hit homer and the first for the Astros this season. It also spoiled a strong start by San Francisco's Tim Lincecum.	"We're having a tough time keeping the ball in the ballpark," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "These are games we need to close out."	San Francisco's Randy Winn doubled twice among his three hits and scored two runs. He has a 10-game hitting streak and needs one double for No. 300 of his career.	Aaron Rowand drove in two runs for the Giants, who got five straight hits off starter Chris Sampson to start the third on an unusually hot spring day in the Bay Area. It was 95 degrees at first pitch -- the second-hottest day in the ballpark's 9-year history and the third game when the temperature reached 90.	Omar Vizquel singled in his first three at-bats to give him 2,606 hits, moving him past Tim Raines for seventh place among switch-hitters. John Bowker hit a two-run double and added a sacrifice fly for the Giants.	Houston's Hunter Pence extended his hitting streak to 13 games with a double in the fourth, then Berkman followed with his two-run single. Mark Loretta also had an RBI single in the inning.	Alex Hinshaw, called up from Triple-A Fresno earlier in the day, relieved Walker to make his major league debut and struck out Michael Bourn before allowing a single to Kaz Matsui and giving way to Chulk.	"Basically, you can blame me for losing this game," Walker said. "No way Vinnie should pitch in that game. There were six outs to go with a four-run lead. I know the Astros are a good hitting team, but that's our job. It's something you have to come back from."	Lincecum walked Berkman to start the second but that was his only baserunner until Matsui's single to start the fourth. Lincecum struck out 10 for his fourth career game with 10 or more Ks and second this year. He allowed three runs, five hits and three walks in six innings.	"He had just a little blip on the radar there," Berkman said. "He's got as good of stuff as I've ever seen."	Rowand's high chopper in the first got past shortstop Loretta for an error and an RBI, allowing Vizquel to score from third for a 1-0 lead. Regular starting shortstop Miguel Tejada took his first day off of the season for Houston before pinch-hitting in the ninth.	The Astros will conclude their season-long, 10-game road trip with three interleague games at Texas starting Friday.	Game notes	 Astros reliever Geoff Geary left with a strained right groin. ... Houston stole three bases, including the seventh of the year by Berkman, to extend its major league lead to 45. ... Vizquel had three or more hits for the 176th time in his 20-year big league career. ... Houston 3B Ty Wigginton was held out of the lineup for the third straight game after getting hit in the left ribcage area Monday, but is expected to return Friday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Music blared in the Tampa Bay clubhouse and four large, flat-screen televisions mounted around a column in the middle of the room were tuned to the same in-house channel displaying the AL East standings.	The surprising Rays are on top, and the sputtering Yankees are on the bottom. No one was gloating, though.	"I want us to celebrate hard for 30 minutes postgame and then move on. I want us to dwell on a loss for no more than 30 minutes," manager Joe Maddon said after Thursday's 5-2 victory dumped New York into the cellar.	"Sometimes I get away from my own rule on the negative side. But I think the guys are handling this very well. It's the confidence that's been gained. It's the momentum that you create. ... It's a feeling that did not exist before, so first of all, you have to nurture it and grow it, and then once you got it, you have to do everything you can to hold on to it because it can go away."	Scott Kazmir shined in his first start since agreeing to a $28.5 million contract extension, and Akinori Iwamura and Shawn Riggans homered off Ian Kennedy to help Tampa Bay win for the seventh time in eight games.	Kazmir (2-1) allowed three singles in six scoreless innings, even though he's still trying to regain his form after spending April on the disabled list with a left elbow strain sustained in spring training.	"I'll take it," said Kazmir, who also gave up three hits in six scoreless innings in his previous start against the Los Angeles Angels.	"I feel like I'm fighting myself just a little bit. The velocity is not where I want it right now. ... It feels like I'm just on the verge. The next start or two, it feels like everything is going to come together."	Tampa Bay (24-17), which started play in 1998, has been alone atop the division standings for three consecutive days for the first time. The Rays won three of four from New York and have captured six of seven series in building the best record in the AL.	The Yankees (20-22) have lost six of nine and got another shaky performance from Kennedy (0-3), recalled from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre for his sixth start of the season.	Things don't get any easier this weekend. The Yankees head home to face Johan Santana and the crosstown rival Mets in the opener of the Subway Series on Friday night.	"You face a lot of good pitchers all year long," manager Joe Girardi said. "He's one of the best in baseball. That doesn't mean that you can't score runs. You've got to take advantage of your opportunities."	New York, struggling with Alex Rodriguez and Jorge Posada on the DL, was shut out until seventh-inning RBI singles by Derek Jeter and Melky Cabrera off Gary Glover. The Yankees scored six runs in the series, only two off Rays starters.	"We're much better than this. We can't start blaming injuries. It's part of the game," outfielder Johnny Damon said. "We just have to deal with it, and we haven't dealt with it the right way."	Kazmir agreed Wednesday to a three-year extension through 2011, a deal with a club option that could raise the contract's value to $39.5 million over four seasons. He walked three and struck out three in his third start since returning on May 4.	The 2007 AL strikeout champion threw 100 pitches -- 59 strikes -- and worked out of situations with runners in scoring position in the fourth, fifth and sixth innings.	"He threw what, 50 fastballs in a row? And we get one hit. That's not good," Girardi said. "We're a better hitting club than that. They did the things to win three out of four. We did not."	Iwamura hit the third leadoff homer of his career in the first inning, and Riggans added a two-run shot off Kennedy that made it 4-0 in the fourth. Carl Crawford and B.J. Upton also drove in runs for the Rays with sacrifice flies.	Troy Percival pitched a perfect ninth for his 10th save in 12 opportunities.	Kennedy was sent to the minors after going 0-2 with an 8.37 ERA in six appearances, including five starts. The demotion May 4 turned out to be a short one when the right-hander didn't allow a run in eight innings at Triple-A.	He had given up just two homers in 42 2/3 major league innings before Iwamura hit his fourth pitch of the game into the right-field seats. Riggans hit his third of the season, one pitch after Eric Hinske doubled to right.	Kennedy allowed five runs and five hits in five innings. He walked one and struck out three.	"He was OK, but he needs to do better," Girardi said. "This is not the Ian Kennedy we all saw last year. We need to find a way to get him back there."	Game notes	 LHP Kei Igawa was optioned to Triple-A to make room for Kennedy. The move left the Yankees without a left-hander in the bullpen. ...

PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Cole Hamels finally finished what he started.	The Philadelphia left-hander pitched his first career shutout, Ryan Howard homered and the Phillies beat the Atlanta Braves 5-0 on Thursday night.	"I'm always wanting to go out there and finish it," said Hamels, who lowered his ERA from 3.36 to 2.89. "It was nice to finally get that done."	Pedro Feliz and Shane Victorino also homered and drove in two runs each for the Phillies, who lead the major leagues with 59 home runs. The Florida Marlins have hit 58, but their game against Cincinnati was rained out Thursday.	Because of the postponement, the Phillies also moved within a game of the Marlins for the top spot in the NL East.	Hamels (5-3) gave up just four hits, struck out six and walked two in his first complete game of the season. Only two runners reached second base against Hamels, who has lasted at least seven innings in eight of his nine starts this season.	Hamels retired 15 batters in a row between the first and sixth innings. He wound up throwing his third career complete game and the first shutout by a Philadelphia pitcher since last July 22, when J.D. Durbin accomplished the feat against San Diego.	"I'm happy because all along I've said sooner or later he was going to throw a shutout and close out the game," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said.	Hamels threw 120 pitches, 85 for strikes, and had excellent command of all his pitches.	"I think throwing a lot of first pitch strikes helped keep my pitch count down," he said.	Feliz supplied some quick offense with a solo homer in the first, and Howard followed with a 426-foot solo shot over the center field wall in the third. The home run pushed Howard's season-high hitting streak to seven games.	Feliz drove in Pat Burrell later in the third, and Victorino hit his first homer of the season in the fourth, a two-run shot to left-center for a 5-0 lead.	"It felt good," Victorino said. "We always win as a team, but it felt good for me."	All three homers came against Braves starter Chuck James (2-3), who allowed the five runs on six hits and five walks in four shaky innings.	"He's getting his changeup in the middle of the plate," Braves manager Bobby Cox said of James. "He's got to adjust -- and Philly's a tough place to adjust in."	Jimmy Rollins added two hits and scored a run for the Phillies, who had every starter except for Chase Utley reach base on a hit. Rollins also stole a base in the first, the 14th consecutive steal for Philadelphia dating to April 23, at Milwaukee.	The Braves played without Chipper Jones, who was a late scratch because of a sore groin suffered in his ninth inning at-bat Wednesday. Omar Infante took over at third base for Jones, who leads the major leagues with a .418 batting average.	The Braves could have used that kind of plate presence against Hamels, who is 3-0 in his last four starts.	"I only had two at-bats and I saw nothing but fastballs," Atlanta center fielder Mark Kotsay said. "He pitched very well. It's the first time I've seen him and he was very impressive."	Game notes	 Hamels tied his career high with two hits, raising his average to .320. ... Phillies catcher Chris Coste is 5-for-7 in his last two games. ... Braves pitcher John Smoltz turned 41 on Thursday. He is currently on the disabled list and expects to join the bullpen when he comes back. ... Atlanta fell to 20-20 -- 14-4 at home and 6-16 on the road.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

PHOENIX (AP) -- Mr. Automatic was at it again.	Backed by Stephen Drew's career-high four hits, Brandon Webb became the major leagues' first nine-game winner when the Arizona Diamondbacks defeated the Colorado Rockies 8-5 on Thursday night.	Webb (9-0) has won his first nine starts, the most since San Diego's Andy Hawkins won his first 10 in 1985, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Webb has won 11 straight starts dating to last September.	"It's pretty amazing," Webb said. "It's getting to be amazing. Things are just happening."	A lot of things happened on a clear, 85-degree night in the desert.	Drew had two doubles, a triple, a single and an RBI, and Chris Snyder hit a three-run homer as the Diamondbacks improved to a major league-best 26-15, including 20-5 against the weak NL West.	Arizona overcame a season-high four errors to complete its second three-game sweep of the Rockies this season. The Diamondbacks are 8-1 against the defending NL champions, with Webb winning three times.	Mixing curveballs and changeups with his trademark slider, Webb had the Rockies off stride for most of the night.	"Nothing was in the middle," Colorado manager Clint Hurdle said. "The breaking ball was sharp and down, the changeup was a good pitch. The sinker had good late life."	Arizona manager Bob Melvin lifted Webb with one out in the eighth after Matt Holliday singled to make it 5-3. Webb, who threw 111 pitches, left to a standing ovation from the Chase Field crowd of 21,447.	He allowed three runs on six hits, walked one and struck out eight, a season high.	"Doing his thing again," Melvin said. "He got a little tired at the end."	Webb credited his offense for giving him plenty of support -- and none had a better night than Drew.	He singled in the first, tripled in the third and doubled in the fifth against Colorado starter Aaron Cook. Drew had two chances at the cycle -- doubling in the sixth off Josh Newman and reaching on an error against Brian Fuentes in the eighth.	"He's swinging it better than anybody we have right now," Melvin said. "He's been quite the force for us."	Colorado's Aaron Cook (6-2) was almost as hot as Webb. He had won a franchise-record six straight starts, a streak that began on April 13 at Chase Field.	But Cook struggled from the start, when the Diamondbacks greeted him with consecutive singles by Chris Young, Drew and Orlando Hudson. Young scored on Hudson's hit.	Cook stranded runners in scoring position in the second, third and fourth. The Diamondbacks finally got to him in the fifth.	Young led off with a double and scored on Drew's double. Hudson walked, and one out later, Snyder hit an 0-2 pitch 412 feet into the left field seats to give the Diamondbacks a 5-0 lead.	"The biggest blow right there was Snyder hitting the home run, of course," Cook said. "I felt like I have a chance to get out of any situation I'm in, and unfortunately I wasn't able to make pitches when I needed to tonight and it cost us the ballgame."	Cook pitched five innings, his shortest outing, and allowed a season-high five runs on 10 hits. He walked four and struck out six.	Snyder's homer loomed large when the Rockies' bats came to life in the late innings.	Colorado made it 5-1 in the seventh on Chris Iannetta's double, and pulled within 5-3 in the eighth on Clint Barmes' RBI groundout and Holliday's single.	Arizona answered with three in the eighth on Hudson's single and a two-run triple by Justin Upton.	But even with an 8-3 lead heading in to the ninth, Webb had to sweat out a little drama before he could claim the victory.	The Rockies loaded the bases with no outs against Brandon Medders before Brandon Lyon came on to record his 12th save in 14 chances, and his 11th in a row.	Lyon gave up an RBI single to Scott Podsednik to make it 8-4, and Ryan Spilborghs' sacrifice fly made it 8-5.	But Lyon struck out Barmes and retired Holliday -- who had cost Lyon a save with a homer in Denver last month	-- on a grounder to third to end it.	Game notes	 Melvin benched LF Eric Byrnes, who is hitting .214 and in a 6-for-62 slump. Arizona 1B Conor Jackson, 0-for-12 lifetime against Cook, was also out of the starting lineup. ... The Rockies fell a season-high 11 games back in the NL West. ... Barmes had two singles and has hit safely in eight straight games.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Slumping slugger Jim Thome had former teammate Jon Garland on the ropes in the second inning, coming up with the bases loaded and three runs already across the plate.	He grounded out that time, but came through in the ninth when it mattered most.	Thome hit a go-ahead RBI single off Francisco Rodriguez to help the Chicago White Sox beat the Los Angeles Angels 4-3 on Thursday night and salvage a split of the four-game series.	"I was so happy for him, just for the fact that he got that hit," said A.J. Pierzynski, who scored the deciding run. "Everyone's kind of been on him a little bit. And to have him up in that situation and have him get that hit was huge for the team and obviously huge for him. I think that'll get him going."	Pierzynski led off the ninth with his third hit of the game and second double. He tagged up and advanced to third on Carlos Quentin's flyout to the warning track in center and scored when Thome stroked a 1-0 pitch to right field. He was 0-for-13 in the series before getting his third hit in 21 at-bats on the road trip.	The White Sox now go to San Francisco for three games, but Thome will not start any of them because the designated hitter rule is not in effect at NL ballparks. This season has started out miserably for the five-time All-Star, who is batting a measly .204 after entering this season with a career average of .281.	"Everybody was rooting for him big-time," manager Ozzie Guillen said. "That guy is a class act and he shows up every day the same way. One thing about him, he never gives up on himself. He's always trying to give you the best at-bats he can. That big hit was good for the ballclub, but it was the best thing for him. We believe in him."	Octavio Dotel (2-2) pitched 1 1/3 hitless innings for the win and Bobby Jenks got three outs for his eighth save in 10 attempts. Jenks, a former Angels prospect claimed off waivers by Chicago after the 2004 season, has 95 career saves.	"Just about everyone in the organization felt he could have been a terrific starter, but he also had the ability to be a closer or a setup guy because he had a power arm," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "Obviously that's gotten him to the big leagues and allowed him to achieve.	"Bobby never really got his feet on the ground when we had him. He had a lot of growing up to do, and he did. When the White Sox got him, they put him in Double-A, where he went to the bullpen and started to figure stuff out. He really fed off of that kind of situation, and he's done well."	Jenks last season became the first pitcher in White Sox history with consecutive 40-save seasons. During one stretch, the two-time All-Star retired 41 consecutive batters to tie Jim Barr's major league record with San Francisco.	"The biggest thing I can attribute my success to is that I became a pitcher, not just a guy who goes out there and tries to throw it by everybody," Jenks said. "After I had the surgery on my elbow, the best idea for me was to eliminate as many innings as possible. And obviously, the best way to do that is by going to the bullpen."	Garland allowed three runs and seven hits over six innings in his first regular-season game against the Sox since getting traded to the Angels in November for shortstop Orlando Cabrera. The right-hander pitched with runners on base in every inning but the sixth, walking four and striking out one.	Garland was an All-Star with Chicago in 2005, when he won a World Series ring and became the first White Sox pitcher in 70 years to win his first eight starts en route to the first of consecutive 18-win seasons.	"He did great for us, and you hate to lose a guy like that. I haven't gotten used to it yet," first baseman Paul Konerko said. "Anytime I've seen him in spring training or saw him on TV, it hasn't looked right. But I know he loves it out here because he's close to home. He's a California guy, so it's a good fit for him. He went to a great team that's been in playoff contention every year."	Javier Vazquez took a 3-2 lead into the seventh before Maicer Izturis hit a two-out infield single and took third on Vladimir Guerrero's double. Matt Thornton relieved Vazquez and got Garret Anderson to hit a grounder to third baseman Joe Crede, whose fielding error allowed the tying run to score.	Casey Kotchman had a chance to give the Angels the lead, but grounded into a force play with the bases loaded after a walk to Torii Hunter.	Vazquez allowed three runs -- two earned -- and nine hits over 6 2/3 innings with no walks and six strikeouts.	Game notes	 Pierzynski's next game will be his 1,000th in the majors during the regular season. ... The Angels held a 1970s "Retro Night," complete with psychedelic motif, throwback uniforms and caps from 1971, music from that era -- and doctored head shots on the scoreboard of each player in '70s-style hairdos. During that decade, the Halos were 90-79 against the White Sox. Both teams played in the AL West during those years, with the Angels winning a division title in 1979. ... How appropriate that the White Sox were in town for the 1970's nostalgia theme. On July 12, 1979, at Comiskey Park, Sox owner Bill Veeck's son Mike allowed a Chicago radio station to hold a "Disco Demolition Night" promotional event between games of a twi-night doubleheader with Detroit. The whole thing backfired, and the resulting chaos from thousands of fans storming the field led to the Sox forfeiting the nightcap to the Tigers.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CHICAGO (AP) -- Alfonso Soriano got booed and jeered during a slow start. Now he's showing again that he can carry a team.	Soriano homered in his first two at-bats, Geovany Soto and Mark DeRosa went deep and the surging Chicago Cubs beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 7-4 Friday for their seventh win in eight games.	Soriano connected on the first pitch from Tom Gorzelanny for his third leadoff home run in four games. Soriano launched a three-run shot in the second inning that made it 6-0, giving him five homers this week and eight this season. He has 15 hits in his last 32 at-bats.	"That's where I want to be," he said. "I got a big salary. That's why they signed me. That's what they expect."	Soto capped a three-run first with a solo homer, and DeRosa added one in the sixth inning. Chicago won its 10th straight overall against the Pirates, including 7-0 this year.	Sean Gallagher (1-0) earned his first major league win in his second start for Chicago. He allowed one run and four hits before pitcher Carlos Zambrano pinch-hit for him in the sixth.	After making eight relief appearances last season, the 22-year-old Gallagher was a late fill-in for Zambrano against Arizona on Sunday after rain delayed the start. Gallagher pitched well enough to earn another turn, and manager Lou Piniella said he'll stay in the rotation for now even though Piniella would like to add a left-hander.	Kerry Wood pitched a perfect ninth for his ninth save in 12 opportunities.	Gorzelanny (3-4), from the Chicago suburb of Evergreen Park, pitched poorly against the Cubs for the third time this season. He gave up a career-high four homers and seven runs in six innings after getting chased in the third inning of his previous two outings against Chicago.	And when asked what he'll do differently the next time he faces the Cubs, Gorzelanny quickly responded: "Let's hope I don't face them again."	The Pirates had won eight of 10, but they continued to struggle against Chicago.	"We just never really gave ourselves a chance against a club that's playing good baseball and has a good team," manager John Russell said. "It's tough to get down that big early."	Pittsburgh got three runs off reliever Bob Howry in the eighth, when Jason Bay hit a solo homer and Doug Mientkiewicz added a two-run shot. Otherwise, it was a one-sided game.	Soriano was hitting .175 when he hobbled onto the disabled list last month with a strained right calf. While he recovered, fans called for Piniella to drop him from the leadoff spot and questioned the Cubs' decision to sign him to that eight-year, $136 million contract in November 2006.	Soriano again shrugged off questions about his spot in the order, saying, "After the first at-bat, I can bat three or four or five in that inning."	His recent burst includes a fifth-inning homer against San Diego's Randy Wolf on Monday and leadoff shots against Shawn Estes and Jake Peavy on Tuesday and Wednesday.	The leadoff homer against Gorzelanny was the 47th of Soriano's career. His 20th multihomer game was his first since Sept. 22 against Pittsburgh.	"When he's going good he's charismatic, he's having fun, he's keeping us loose and we seem to roll from there," DeRosa said.	Soriano went on a similar streak last September when he batted .320 and hit 14 homers.	He's being a little more selective at the plate and keeping his hands back -- two simple but important adjustments that have restored his confidence, not to mention a batting average that is now .265.	"He's one of the best ballplayers in the game for a reason," DeRosa said. "When you go that bad, that just means you're going to go that good at some point. He's one of the most exciting players in the game. He's able to do things that other guys can't do. He's proven it time and time again. There wasn't a guy on the bench that didn't think he wasn't going to hit another home run."	Game notes	 Piniella reiterated that he expects Daryle Ward to go on the disabled list with a bulging disc in his lower back, even though he can pinch-hit. ... Soriano has led off four straight games with hits. He singled in the first on Thursday. ... Thursday's crowd of 40,537 bumped the Cubs' season attendance to 1,000,892 through 25 home games -- the quickest they've reached the million mark. ... Mientkiewicz's homer was his first since Sept. 18 against Baltimore.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Washington Nationals' poor outfield play proved costlier than the Baltimore Orioles' baserunning blunders.	Luke Scott homered, Melvin Mora hit a tiebreaking double in the fifth inning and the Orioles rallied past Washington 5-3 Friday night for their sixth win in seven games and third consecutive come-from-behind victory.	"Obviously it's not the way you want to draw it up, playing from behind all the time, but you've got to do an awful lot of little things right to get yourself back in," Baltimore manager Dave Trembley said.	Washington's fielding woes were to blame for a wild two-run fifth that broke a 3-all tie. Two Orioles baserunners were thrown out and Washington outfielders twice misjudged fly balls.	Brian Roberts led off with a triple off the wall in right field against Shawn Hill (0-1). Roberts, who reached third when the ball caromed past Elijah Dukes and into short right, scored when center fielder Lastings Milledge misplayed Mora's fly ball to right-center.	Milledge appeared indecisive on a catchable drive and the ball landed just outside the webbing of his glove. Neither Milledge nor Dukes called for the ball and Milledge said he wasn't sure he could even reach the fly.	"We were in a shift and they hit it where we weren't," he said. "I have a lot to learn yet. I'm not going to lie to you about that."	After Nick Markakis struck out, Mora was tagged out during a rundown between second and third when Aubrey Huff hit a sharp comebacker to Hill. Kevin Millar followed with an RBI single to center, but was thrown out trying to advance after Huff scored for a 5-3 Orioles lead.	Left-hander Garrett Olson (3-0) struggled through five innings but remained undefeated in four starts since being recalled from Triple-A Norfolk on April 29. He allowed three runs and nine hits while striking out three.	The first three Nationals hitters reached against Olson, producing a quick 2-0 lead. Felipe Lopez led off with a single, moved to third on Cristian Guzman's double and both scored on Ryan Zimmerman's liner to left, the first of his three hits.	"You don't look forward to those outings, but sometimes it happens," Olson said. "I didn't feel like I had my sharpest stuff out there tonight, but I tried to keep attacking the zone. When that happens, you have your defense behind you."	The Nationals wasted an opportunity in the fourth, when they loaded the bases with no outs on singles by Aaron Boone, Milledge and Jesus Flores. Olson struck out Wily Mo Pena, got Dukes to hit a sacrifice fly and coaxed a rally-ending fly ball from Lopez.	"Olson learned how to pitch tonight without his best stuff and I give him a lot of credit, because I don't know whether he would have been able to do that last year," Trembley said. "He competed."	Matt Albers worked two scoreless innings, Jim Johnson struck out the side in the eighth and George Sherrill got the final three outs for his 16th save in 18 tries.	Hill allowed five runs -- four earned -- on eight hits, walked two and struck out three.	"He didn't have his breaking ball. Basically, it was nonexistent," Washington manager Manny Acta said. "They waited on his fastball, and he didn't have control of that either."	Baltimore erased the 2-0 deficit in the second when Markakis hit into a bases-loaded fielder's choice, and second baseman Lopez's relay to first for an attempted double play sailed wide, scoring another run.	After Dukes restored the Nationals' lead in the fourth, Scott tied the game with a solo homer to right-center, his third of the year, in the bottom of the inning.	Game notes	 Washington activated 1B Dmitri Young (sprained lower back) from the 15-day disabled list Friday. Young went 1-for-4 as the Nationals' designated hitter. ... Johnson has not allowed any of his 12 inherited runners to score this season. ... Zimmerman is 17-for-46 (.369) with 11 RBIs in his last 10 road games.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Jayson Werth could not remember ever being this productive in a game -- that's including Little League.	Werth homered in his first three at-bats and tied a Philadelphia Phillies record with eight RBIs in a 10-3 win over the Toronto Blue Jays on Friday night.	"Anything can happen on any given day, I guess," Werth said. "This game is crazy. It's not like I was trying to do anything like that. It just happened. I don't know what else to say. It's just crazy."	Werth had a chance to tie the major league record of four homers in a game in the seventh inning. But with most of the 36,600 fans still in the stands despite the lopsided score and brisk weather, standing and cheering, he fouled out to first base on a 3-2 pitch off Brian Tallet.	"Hitting a home run was probably on my mind," Werth said. "I was just looking for a good pitch to hit."	Werth hit an 0-1 pitch off Blue Jays starter David Purcey for a three-run home run to right field in the second inning and topped that with a 425-foot grand slam to right on a 3-1 pitch against Purcey (0-1) in the third.	Purcey was optioned to Triple-A Syracuse after the game.	"When you have balls over the plate, he's a good hitter and he's going to hit them," Purcey said. "I was just trying to make a perfect pitch and fell behind on them."	Werth then ripped a solo shot to left-center in the fifth off reliever Jesse Litsch on a 2-1 pitch for a 9-2 lead.	"I hit an offspeed pitch and it was one of those things where everything clicked," Werth said.	Werth became the 18th Phillies player to record three homers in a game. Ryan Howard was the last to hit three -- on Sept. 3, 2006, against Atlanta in the first game of a doubleheader.	"If you watch him [Werth] in batting practice, he can hit the ball as far as anybody," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said.	The eight RBIs tied a franchise record held by four players, most recently by Mike Schmidt in a 10-inning game at Chicago on April 17, 1976. The others are Kitty Bransfeld (1910), Gavvy Cravath (1915) and Willie Jones (1958).	"Jayson had a great night at the plate," Howard said. "It's a night he'll remember, I'm sure. He deserves it because he's been working hard at it."	Howard extended his hitting streak to eight games with an RBI single to right, scoring Jimmy Rollins, ahead of Werth's grand slam.	Philadelphia's 45-year-old left-hander Jamie Moyer (3-3) went 6 2/3 innings and gave up seven hits and three earned runs. He walked two and struck out five.	"I felt like I threw the ball a lot better than I have recently," Moyer said. "We won and that's the most important part."	Purcey, who was making just his second major league start, allowed five hits and eight runs while walking four in three shaky innings.	"It was only his second big-league start and it's not easy," Toronto manager John Gibbons said. "He'll get over the nerves."	Alex Rios and Lyle Overbay had two hits each for the Blue Jays, who had their four-game winning streak snapped.	Game notes	 The last player to hit three homers against the Blue Jays was Tony Clark on Aug. 28, 2004. Toronto left fielder Kevin Mench left the game in the fourth inning because of a bruised right knee. He is day to day. Chris Coste started for the Phillies at catcher in place of Carlos Ruiz, who had a minor stomach ailment.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.
