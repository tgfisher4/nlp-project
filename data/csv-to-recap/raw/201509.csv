SEATTLE -- Nelson Cruz doesn't concern himself with the number of home runs he hits. Instead, he counts what they do to help his team win games.	Nelson Cruz reached 40 home runs for the second straight season, Felix Hernandez pitched three-hit ball for eight innings, and the Seattle Mariners downed the Texas Rangers 5-0 on Thursday.	"Numbers are numbers. I like to just focus on games," said Cruz, who signed a four-year free-agent contract during the offseason. "What I like to do is help my team win games. They [homers] are going to come. At end of the season, you have time to realize what you did."	The Rangers were shut out for the second straight day. Their lead for the second AL wild-card spot was cut to one game over idle Minnesota. Texas missed a chance to gain on AL West-leading Houston and fell 2 1/2 games behind the idle Astros.	Cruz had missed the previous six games because of a strained right quadriceps. He matched his career high for homers, set last season with Baltimore, when he connected for a two-run shot in the Mariners' three-run seventh.	Hernandez (17-8) struck out eight and walked four. He tied Houston's Dallas Keuchel for most victories in the AL.	"I had good mechanics today," said Hernandez, who was given an extra day of rest between starts. "My fastball was good. My sinker was down. My changeup was down. Before, it was not moving at all. Now it's down."	Mitch Moreland, who had two hits for Texas, said Hernandez "was on his game. When he is like that, it is going to be tough."	"He had everything working for him," he said. "He was getting ahead, keeping the balls down, throwing every pitch for strikes. His off-speed was on. One of those days, it's tough to stand in the box and battle with him when he is on like that."	Derek Holland (3-2) worked seven innings and allowed all five runs and nine hits.	"I felt like I did a good job all the way until the last inning," Holland said. "I attacked the zone. The home run pitch to Cruz just came in across the plate. I thought I did a pretty good job of battling with Felix, but he had us under control."	The Rangers were blanked in back-to-back games for the first time since July 2013 at Cleveland. They have been shut out four times on their 10-game road trip.	Cruz became the fourth Mariner to hit at least 40 home runs in a season. Ken Griffey Jr. did it six times, and Alex Rodriguez and Jay Buhner each had three such seasons. Rodriguez was the most recent to reach the milestone, with 41 homers in 2000.	It was Cruz's 14th home run this year at Safeco Field, the most in a season at the ballpark since Jose Lopez in 2008.	Mark Trumbo's two-run homer in the first extended his hitting streak to a career-high 12 games. He is batting .375 with five home runs and 11 RBI during the streak.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: Slugger Josh Hamilton will have arthroscopic surgery on his ailing left knee Friday. The team is hopeful he can return before the end of the season.	Mariners: LHP James Paxton, on the DL since May 29 with a strained left middle finger, threw a bullpen session Thursday morning. If he feels OK Friday, he will start Sunday for his first start since May 28. ... OF Franklin Gutierrez (strained right groin) missed his sixth straight game.	UP NEXT	Rangers: RHP Colby Lewis (14-8, 4.68 ERA) will make his fourth attempt at a career-best 15th victory at home against Oakland. He has struggled his past three starts and gone 0-3 with a 8.62 ERA. He is 9-4 with a 3.08 ERA in 25 career starts against the A's, his most wins against any opponent.	Mariners: RHP Hisashi Iwakuma (7-3, 4.03 ERA) is 5-1 with a 2.98 ERA over his past seven starts, including a no-hitter Aug. 12 against Baltimore. He has never faced Colorado.	SETTING UP FOR HOUSTON	The Rangers are adjusting their rotation by pushing LHP Cole Hamels back one day to open the four-game home series with Houston that begins Monday. "That's the way we wanted it," Rangers manager Jeff Banister said. "That's why we got him [in a July 31 trade with Philadelphia]." Minor league prospect Chi Chi Gonzalez will take Hamels' scheduled start Sunday against Oakland.	BARON DEBUT	Steven Baron made his big league catching debut for the Mariners on Wednesday. He became the first Seattle catcher to call a shutout in his debut.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

SAN DIEGO --  Before Charlie Blackmon leaped at the center-field wall, Colorado manager Walt Weiss was convinced Brett Wallace had tied the score.	"I thought it was a home run off the bat," Weiss said.	Blackmon jumped just at the wall and caught the ball near the top of the fence with one out in the ninth inning Thursday, preserving the Rockies' 4-3 win over the San Diego Padres.	Nolan Arenado hit his NL-leading 38th home run for the Rockies. Carlos Gonzalez hit his 37th homer, and Daniel Descalso hit a tiebreaking shot leading off the eighth. Corey Dickerson also connected for Colorado.	The game was a make-up of a rainout in July 19, the second rainout at Petco Park, which opened in 2004. It was also the hottest gametime temperature in Petco Park at 93 degrees.	"That part was tough, knowing that we were in Southern California, but it felt like Atlanta," Arenado said. "We've played in weather like this before. To win like that was kind of weird, but we will take it."	Descalso homered off Joaquin Benoit (6-5), who had not pitched since Saturday because of back spasms.	"I was just trying to get on base there looking for a good pitch to hit," Descalso said. "He left something out over the plate and I was able to put a good swing on it and drive it. I hit it really well, but this a big yard. But I was pretty sure it was gone."	Arenado has homered in eight of his 11 games in September. He leads the league with 108 RBI.	"I'm just trying to hit the ball hard and have good at-bats," Arenado said. "To hit 40 would be an amazing accomplishment. We still have a lot of games left."	Justin Miller (2-2) struck out the side in the seventh and fanned all seven batters he faced in the series. John Axford closed for his 21st save in 26 chances.	Matt Kemp homered for San Diego and has reached base in a career-high 30 consecutive games.	San Diego starter Tyson Ross allowed three runs and four hits in seven innings and also drove in a run with a sacrifice fly in the fourth. He struck out six and walked none.	"I thought Tyson went into the game he wasn't feeling good physically," Padres interim manager Pat Murphy said. "He was sick today. For him to do what he did today to give us a chance to win, I thought he was good. We just didn't take advantage of what we could have under the circumstances."	Ross had given up five home runs in 171 innings before the Rockies tagged him three times. He had gone 45 consecutive starts without allowing multiple homers.	"I think all three of them I was behind in the count," Ross said. "I didn't walk anybody today but in those instances I made mistakes up in the zone and they put good swings on them. That tends to happen. But overall I was happy in how I threw the ball, except for giving up the lead there in the seventh."	Colorado starter Jorge De La Rosa exited after five innings, allowing three runs and six hits.	"Jorge struggled a little bit," Weiss said. "He got himself into a couple jams, but he's really good at limiting the damage. He kept us in position to win."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: Padres 1B Yonder Alonso (back) is unlikely to return this season. . OF Justin Upton (toenail) was held out of the starting lineup on Thursday but pinch hit in the ninth.	UP NEXT	Rockies: RHP Chad Bettis (6-5, 4.95) will make his third start since coming off the disabled list, looking to improve upon his last outing in which he allowed four runs in 4 1/3 innings as Colorado travels to Seattle. The Mariners will counter with RHP Hisashi Iwakuma (7-3, 4.03).	Padres: RHP Andrew Cashner (5-14, 4.11) takes the mound in San Francisco for the Padres on Friday. Cashner allowed six runs -- five earned -- over five innings in his last start at Los Angeles. The Giants counter with RHP Jake Peavy (5-6, 4.41).	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

PITTSBURGH -- Not even the iconic signal and the familiar face it summoned could save the Pittsburgh Pirates from a villain doing its best to put a cramp in an otherwise compelling summer.	A.J. Burnett returned from a lengthy stay on the disabled list and settled down from a bumpy start to put together five encouraging innings but the Pirates couldn't take advantage in a 6-4 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers in 13 innings on Thursday night.	With several buildings across the Allegheny River from PNC Park sporting neon green Batman signs -- Burnett's comic book hero of choice -- the 38-year-old gave up three first-inning runs in his first start since July 30. He settled down over the final four frames and insisted he felt fine after missing six weeks with a strained right elbow.	Burnett called the signs -- a nod of respect from Pittsburgh mayor Bill Peduto -- "the coolest thing to happen to me in my career." Still, he would have preferred a win after the Pirates fell to the Brewers for the seventh straight time and refused to chalk up his early struggles to rust.	"I'm too old to get amped up over a start," Burnett said.	Pittsburgh eventually got Burnett off the hook. Andrew McCutchen's 22nd homer tied it in the eighth and Gregory Polanco's solo shot in the 12th off Milwaukee closer Francisco Rodriguez knotted it again.	The Brewers, however, finally put the Pirates away in the 13th while getting to Radhames Liz (1-4). Logan Shafer singled home Nevin Ashley with the go-ahead and Luis Sardinas added an insurance run. The loss by Liz ended a streak of 19 consecutive decisions by Pittsburgh relievers, the longest streak in the majors in more than a century.	"We kept battling," Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said. "We couldn't find the plate enough early and the game got strung out and couldn't keep them off the plate late."	Rodriguez (1-3) got the win despite the mistake to Polanco. Kyle Lohse earned the second save of his 15-year career.	"It got to be a game where you're just scraping to get baserunners and hope you can make something happen with a baserunner," Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said.	Pittsburgh remained 4 1/2 games behind St. Louis in the NL Central, but in control of the wild-card race.	Hurdle said he wasn't going to put any limits on Burnett, who is retiring after the season and opted for a platelet-rich plasma injection in the elbow rather than surgery following three straight subpar starts after the All-Star break.	The early results were mixed. Burnett hit 91 mph on his first pitch, with Scooter Gennett taking the second and doubling to right-center field. Gennett scored on a groundout by Ryan Braun. Adam Lind then hit a sharp single and Khris Davis followed with a long homer off the batter's eye in center to stake Milwaukee to a 3-0 lead.	"Pitched it down the middle and they did what a big league hitter is supposed to do to them," Burnett said.	His location improved after the first and he cruised through his final four innings, giving up only a pair of walks. Burnett's three strikeouts gave him 2,487 in his career, moving him past Hall of Famer Don Drysdale and into 32nd on the all-time list.	Milwaukee starter Wily Peralta allowed two runs in six-plus innings and appeared to be in decent position to win for the fourth time in his last five decisions when reliever Will Smith struck out Polanco with the bases loaded to end the seventh to preserve a one-run lead.	McCutchen, however, pulled the Pirates even in the eighth, sending a pitch from Corey Knebel into the first row of seats in right field for the 150th homer of his career. McCutchen joined Barry Bonds as the only players in Pirates history to have 150 homers and 150 stolen bases with Pittsburgh.	The Pirates' taxed bullpen -- without setup man Tony Watson and closer Mark Melancon -- finally faltered.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: C Jonathan Lucroy missed his second straight game with concussion-like symptoms after being hit in the jaw by a foul tip on Tuesday. Manager Craig Counsell said the team is "obviously going to be cautious" while monitoring Lucroy's recovery.	Pirates: LF Starling Marte left in the 10th inning due to discomfort in his left shoulder. He was hit by a pitch from Knebel in the eighth and will be re-evaluated on Friday.	UP NEXT	The four-game series continues on Friday when Milwaukee's Jimmy Nelson (11-11, 3.86) faces Pittsburgh's Charlie Morton (8-7, 4.07). Nelson is 4-1 with a 1.72 ERA in five starts against the Pirates this season. Morton is 5-2 with a 3.00 ERA at PNC Park in 2015.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CLEVELAND --  The Cleveland Indians' quest to get back to .500 for the first time since early April was halted by rain.	The Indians and Detroit Tigers had their Friday night game postponed by a downpour that started around 3 p.m. The game never began and will be made up as part of a traditional doubleheader Sunday starting at 1:10 p.m.	Justin Verlander, who has won two of his last three outings, was scheduled to start Friday against rookie Cody Anderson. The two will start Saturday's game at 7:10 p.m.	Verlander, who missed the first two months of the season with a right triceps injury, is 3-7 with a 3.43 ERA in 15 starts.	Cleveland (69-70) hasn't been at the .500 mark since the fourth game of the season. The Indians have won 11 of 15 and six straight at Progressive Field. Cleveland entered Friday four games behind Texas for the second AL wild card spot and is also trailing Minnesota and Los Angeles.	Two home runs by Michael Brantley led the Indians to a 7-5 win in Thursday night's series opener. Brantley's solo homer in the seventh gave Cleveland the lead and his two-run shot off Blaine Hardy in the eighth broke a 5-all tie.	Cleveland's latest win also featured three assists by right fielder Lonnie Chisenhall. He became the first outfielder with three assists in a game since Kansas City's Mark Teahen in 2007.	Chisenhall began the season as the starting third baseman, but was sent to Triple-A Columbus in June. He began playing the outfield in the minors and has made 26 starts since being recalled in July.	"He has turned himself into probably one of the better right fielders in the game," manager Terry Francona said.	Detroit, which has lost 15 of 20, is last in the AL Central with a 64-76 mark. Reports surfaced late Thursday that the Tigers had already decided to fire manager Brad Ausmus. General manager Al Avila released a statement Friday saying evaluations are ongoing and decisions in those areas will be made at the end of the season.	Catcher Alex Avila, the general manager's son, doesn't think Ausmus should be blamed for the Tigers' poor record.	"I think he's done a good job, but this year, he's been dealt a tough hand with the injuries," Avila said. "You've heard it before: A manager is as good as his players -- and we haven't had a good year."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: LHP Daniel Norris (strained right oblique) and RHP Anibal Sanchez (strained rotator cuff) will both throw simulated games Saturday, likely pitching in Cleveland's indoor batting cages.	Indians: RHP Corey Kluber (strained right hamstring) threw a bullpen session Friday and could rejoin the rotation next week.	UP NEXT	Tigers: Verlander makes his 24th career start in Cleveland, where he is 9-12 with a 5.35 ERA. The former AL MVP is 0-1 with a 3.75 ERA against the Indians this year.	Indians: Anderson seeks his second victory over Detroit in six days. The rookie threw seven scoreless innings and earned a 4-0 win at Comerica Park on Sept. 6.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.

ATLANTA -- Bartolo Colon is hardly feeling his age these days, particularly after pitching so many consecutive scoreless innings.	"I'm really proud and surprised myself because I didn't know, at this stage of my career, that I could still do that kind of stuff," he said. "So I'm really proud, but more than that, I'm helping the team."	Colon's scoreless streak ended at 31 innings while he won his fourth straight start, pitching the streaking New York Mets past the reeling Atlanta Braves 7-2 on Thursday night.	Kevin Plawecki and Juan Uribe each drove in three runs for New York, which has won four in a row to increase its NL East lead to 7 1/2 games over Washington.	In a game that started 2 hours, 20 minutes late because of rain, Colon (14-11) allowed seven hits, two runs, one walk and struck out two in 6 2/3 innings.	The 42-year-old Colon, who added an RBI single in the fourth, led 4-0 before Jace Peterson's RBI triple and Andrelton Simmons' single in the seventh.	Atlanta, which has lost 21 of 24 overall, dropped its ninth straight at home to match the franchise's longest single-season skid and worst since the 1988 team started 0-9 at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium.	The Mets' record for consecutive scoreless innings is 32 2/3, set by R.A. Dickey in 2012. Jerry Koosman, in 1973, went 31 2/3 scoreless innings, and Colon tied Dwight Gooden, who went 31 innings in 1984, for third place on the franchise list.	Colon outpitched All-Star Shelby Miller (5-14), whose winless streak reached 21 straight starts -- longest by Braves pitcher since Carl Morton went a franchise-record 22 without a victory from Sept. 10, 1975-July 18, 1976.	The Mets went up 3-0 in the fourth on Plawecki's two-run double and Colon's single. Uribe added an RBI single to make it 4-0 in the seventh.	Plawecki had an RBI groundout for as New York took a 5-2 lead in the eighth. Uribe's two-run double put the Mets up 7-2 in the ninth.	Colon stranded two runners in the first, one in the second and one in the third before retiring nine straight batters.	Since receiving no decision in New York's 14-9 loss at Colorado on Aug. 21, Colon is 5-0 with four walks and 23 strikeouts in stretch of 31 2/3 innings that includes four starts and one relief appearance. He is 13-1 with a 2.52 ERA in 14 starts against NL East opponents this year.	"Now his command is as good as I've seen it in two years," Mets manager Terry Collins said. "That's why you look up and he keeps going deep into games."	Dario Alvarez pitched 1 1/3 innings before Addison Reed got the final three outs.	Miller, who allowed seven hits, three runs, two walks and struck out five in six innings, has now lost six games when giving up no more than one run. He began the night with a 2.81 ERA that ranked sixth in the NL and paltry run support -- 2.45 per nine innings -- that ranked worst in the majors.	Miller has dropped 13 straight decisions, tying Jim Acker from Sept. 29, 1987-Aug. 16, 1989, for the longest in team history.	"You would think so (that it's frustrating), but you have to keep going out there and grinding," Miller said.	Colon's streak is the longest by a pitcher 42 or older.	DEGROM PAUSE	Collins stopped short of saying RHP Jacob deGrom will skip a start, but added that mild fatigue has caused the 27-year-old All-Star to miss recently with his location. Collins said deGrom is struggling slightly with his release point.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: Pitching coach Dan Warthen was admitted to an Atlanta hospital after experiencing an irregular heartbeat before the game. Warthen, 62, has been New York's pitching coach since June 2008. ... RHP Hansel Robles left the team to return to the Dominican Republic because of a family death.	Braves: Manager Fredi Gonzalez has yet to decide if RHP Mike Foltzynewicz (ribs) will work as a starter or a reliever when he's eligible to come off the 15-day disabled list next week.	UP NEXT	Mets: LHP Steven Matz (2-0) will face Atlanta for the first time. He is the first pitcher in franchise history to record at least six strikeouts in each of his first three career starts.	Braves: RHP Matt Wisler (5-6), who beat the Mets 2-1 on June 19 in his major league debut, is 0-5 with a 9.49 ERA in his last seven starts.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CINCINNATI --  The St. Louis Cardinals hoped their come-from behind win on Wednesday over the Chicago Cubs would get them back on track.	Instead, they followed with their most one-sided defeat this season.	Todd Frazier and Brandon Phillips both homered and drove in three runs as the last-place Cincinnati Reds beat the NL Central-leading Cardinals 11-0 Thursday night.	St. Louis opened its longest trip this season -- 10 games in 11 days -- with its fourth loss in five games, including a 9-0 defeat to the Cubs on Monday.	Reds star Joey Votto doubled and singled, driving in a run and scoring one, a day after his tantrum at home plate following an ejection.	Jaime Garcia (8-5) lasted a season-low 4 1/3 innings and gave up six runs. He had been 5-0 in seven starts since losing to the Reds on July 28.	"Definitely not a good one," Garcia said. "There are no excuses. I've got to do a better job the next time."	John Lamb (1-3), one of three left-handers acquired from Kansas City for Johnny Cueto in late July, shook off control problems for his first major league win. He walked six, struck out six and gave up three hits in five innings.	"It was a crazy game," Lamb said.	Four relievers combined to complete St. Louis's 12th shutout loss this year, matching last season's total.	The Reds scored their first two runs on groundouts. Lamb got his first career RBI in the second and Phillips made it 2-0 in the third.	Cincinnati chased Garcia in a four-run fifth that included RBI doubles by Votto and Frazier. Phillips and Bruce each had a sacrifice fly.	Votto's double into the left field corner came on a 3-2 pitch after he fell behind 0-2 and was sent sprawling by a high-and-tight fastball.	"He's locked in right now," manager Mike Matheny said of Votto. "That kind of changed the game a little bit."	Phillips hit 12th homer, a leadoff shot in a three-run seventh. Right fielder Jason Heyward almost made a leaping catch, but he couldn't keep the ball in his glove.	Frazier added his 32nd homer, a two-run line drive in the eighth.	"It's a great feeling, but you have to stay on an even keel," Frazier said.	WELCOME BACK	St. Louis 1B Matt Adams made his first appearance after missing 91 games with a quad injury as a pinch-hitter in the ninth and singled. "Everybody was happy to see him back and active," manager Mike Matheny said. "We were excited to get him in there."	BIG NAMES	Todd Frazier's fifth-inning double was his NL-leading 40th this season, making him just the fourth player in Reds history with at least 40 doubles and 30 home runs in the same season. Frank Robinson (1962), Dave Parker (1985) and Jay Bruce (2013) are the other three.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: OF Randal Grichuk took the day off from throwing as he continues to rehab his inflamed right elbow.

PHILADELPHIA --  Jake Arrieta didn't feel on top of his game. He still displayed dominance that has him among the leading NL Cy Young Award candidates.	Arrieta pitched eight strong innings for his major league-leading 19th win, and Starlin Castro homered to lead the Chicago Cubs past the Philadelphia Phillies 5-1 in the first game of a doubleheader Friday night.	The right-hander said his timing was off, but it didn't prohibit him from shutting down the Phillies.	"Sometimes your body reacts differently on certain nights and it's hard to get into that rhythm," he said. "The adjustment necessary to have a quality outing can be made regardless of how you feel."	Arrieta (19-6) won his eighth straight start, allowing six hits with seven strikeouts and two walks to become the first Cubs pitcher to win that many in a row since Milt Pappas won 11 consecutive games in 1972. In his last 16 starts dating to June 21, the right-hander is 13-1 with a 1.00 ERA and 115 strikeouts in 117 innings. He lowered his season ERA to 1.99.	"Nothing fazes me," Arrieta said. "Men on base, walks, homers. . Deal with it and move forward."	While Arrieta deflected questions about possible upcoming milestones, manager Joe Maddon didn't back away from Cy Young talk.	"I definitely believe our guy deserves it, no question," Maddon said. "I've seen (Zack) Greinke pitch. I know he's really good. I'm getting to watch Jake in person; it's pretty spectacular to watch. My vote's for Jake."	Addison Russell hit a two-run double and Kris Bryant set a club rookie record with his 87th RBI for Chicago, which entered play nine games ahead of San Francisco for the second NL wild-card spot. The Cubs have won six of their last seven.	Aaron Altherr homered for Philadelphia, which has lost 13 of 17.	The nightcap was scheduled to start 30 minutes after the opener of the twin bill, which was necessitated by Thursday night's rainout.	The only blemish for Arrieta was Altherr's second-inning solo homer, which halted his streak of consecutive innings without an earned run at 30 2-3.	Adam Morgan (5-6) allowed four runs and seven hits in five-plus innings.	"I got some balls over the plate and they're a good-hitting team," Morgan said.	The Cubs went ahead with two two-out runs in the fifth. Dexter Fowler tied the game at 1 when he scored from first on Austin Jackson's double to left, and Jackson reached on Bryant's double to right.	Philadelphia played its first game since Thursday's firing of general manager Ruben Amaro Jr.	RBI MAN	Bryant eclipsed Billy Williams (1961) and Geovany Soto (2008) with the run-scoring hit. His 87 RBI are tops among rookies in the majors.	"It just shows, when there's people on base he becomes an even better hitter," Maddon said. "You get guys with that mentality, it makes all the difference in the world."	Bryant, who normally plays third base, made his third appearance in left field. Javier Baez started at third.	CASTRO CRUISING	Castro, who lost his role as an everyday player to 21-year-old shortstop Russell, belted his eighth homer with two outs in the seventh. It was the 13th RBI in 17 games in Philadelphia for Castro, who is 9 for 16 in his last five games overall.	SLUMPING HOWARD	Ryan Howard of the Phillies went 0 for 4 with a strikeout to extend his career-worst slump to 0 for 33. It is the club's longest streak wince Raul Ibanez went 35 straight at-bats without a hit in 2011.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: C Kyle Schwarber, who has been battling an oblique/rib injury, didn't play.	Phillies: Interim manager Pete Mackanin said 3B Maikel Franco (fractured left wrist) will take live batting practice "in a few days." Mackanin is eyeing Sept. 22 at Miami as a possibility for Franco, who has been on the DL since Aug. 12, to rejoin the club.	UP NEXT	RHP Dan Haren (9-9, 3.73) takes the mound for the Cubs on Saturday night against Phillies RHP Jerad Eickhoff (1-3, 4.70).	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

BALTIMORE -- The Baltimore Orioles earned a piece of history by becoming the seventh team in the modern era to hit two grand slams in the same inning.	Between those two home runs, Chris Davis got plunked with a pitch. And that is why Orioles manager Buck Showalter had to watch the second home run on television.	Nolan Reimold and Steve Clevenger both hit slams during a 10-run eighth, giving Baltimore a 14-8 victory over the Kansas City Royals on Friday night.	Since the start of the 20th century, six teams have hit grand slams in the same inning. The Orioles are the only ones to do it twice -- they also pulled it off in 1986 -- and no team had done it since the New York Mets in 2006, STATS said.	"Yeah, it was crazy," Reimold said.	Baltimore trailed 6-4 in the eighth before a double, an error and an infield hit loaded the bases for Reimold, who lined a 2-0 pitch from Kelvin Herrera (4-3) high off the left-field foul pole.	Manny Machado followed with a solo shot off Franklin Morales. After Adam Jones singled, Morales hit Davis in the back with a pitch. Davis slammed down his bat, breaking it in two, as Showalter sprinted out of the dugout.	No one else emerged from either dugout during the potentially volatile situation, although Davis glared at Morales while taking his base.	"We hit a grand slam, another home run, a couple rockets," Davis said. "It just didn't look right, regardless of whether it was on purpose or not."	Showalter thought it was, and was ejected for arguing that point.	Thus, he missed what happened next: Morales lasted one more batter before being replaced by Joba Chamberlain, who yielded Clevenger's slam. Clevenger entered the game earlier in the inning as a pinch hitter.	Royals manager Ned Yost insisted that Morales was not throwing at Davis.	"You're going to react like that because it does hurt," Yost said. "But that pitch wasn't on purpose. There was a lot of hullabaloo after that. But it wasn't on purpose."	Baltimore improved to 3-62 when trailing after seven innings. Kansas City is now 63-3 when leading after seven.	Lorenzo Cain hit two solo homers and Alex Rios also connected with the bases empty for the Royals, who have lost eight of 11.	"You go through stretches like this," Cain said. "We can't let it worry us. We understand we're a good ballclub. We've just got to find a way to bounce back."	The Orioles' three-game winning streak comes on the heels of a stretch in which they lost 15 of 18.	Mychal Givens (2-0) got the win despite giving up two runs in the ninth. Fellow rookie Dariel Alvarez hit his first big league homer for Baltimore.	It was the Royals' first visit to Baltimore since last October, when they opened the AL Championship Series with two straight wins at Camden Yards and completed the four-game sweep at home.	While first-place Kansas City appears poised for a return trip to the postseason, the defending AL East champion Orioles started play Friday trailing six teams for the league's final wild-card spot. Baltimore must win 13 of its last 22 games just to finish .500.	The Royals' early 3-0 lead dwindled to 4-3 before Rios led off the seventh with a drive off Brad Brach -- his first home run since July 17. Davis countered in the bottom half with a run-scoring single to increase his RBI total to 105.	Salvador Perez restored the two-run cushion with an RBI single in the eighth, setting the stage for Baltimore's grand comeback.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals: Reliever Wade Davis was unavailable because of shoulder stiffness.	Orioles: Jones returned to the Baltimore lineup after missing two games with a sore right shoulder. He struck out three times. ... Catcher Matt Wieters remained sidelined with a sore left wrist but hopes to return Saturday.	UP NEXT	Royals: RHP Yordano Ventura (10-8, 4.34 ERA) and RHP Johnny Cueto traded places in the rotation. Ventura will start Saturday afternoon and Cueto under the lights Sunday because he prefers to pitch at night, manager Ned Yost said.	Orioles: Chris Tillman (9-11, 5.15) owns a lifetime ERA of 6.17 against the Royals. The right-hander gave up four runs over six innings in a loss to the Royals on Aug. 27.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

NEW YORK -- David Price sauntered through the clubhouse in that plush new robe several Toronto players were wearing -- sharp blue with the team logo and his name and number on the back.	Manager John Gibbons had his feet propped up on his desk as he carved into a juicy rib-eye steak that sat in his lap.	No doubt about it, after blowing out their closest challengers in the AL East on Friday night, the Blue Jays are beginning to look pretty comfortable.	Russell Martin homered twice and drove in four runs against his former team, and Toronto went deep five times to beat the New York Yankees 11-5 in the opener of their weekend showdown for first place.	"We definitely feed off one another, for sure. It's just our lineup, it just has a lot of depth," Martin said. "I don't think the opposing pitchers feel like they have any breathing room out there. It's just one after the other."	Josh Donaldson and Justin Smoak hit two-run shots in a five-run first inning to build a big lead for Price. Edwin Encarnacion added a titanic drive after the Blue Jays chased rookie starter Luis Severino in the third.	Seeking its first playoff appearance in 22 years, Toronto increased its division lead to 2 1-2 games over New York. The teams play a rare single-admission double-header at Yankee Stadium on Saturday to make up Thursday night's rainout. The four-game series concludes Sunday.	"Any win from here on out is the biggest win of the year," Price said.	A vocal contingent of Toronto fans made themselves heard all night, with Yankees supporters attempting to drown out chants of "Let's go Blue Jays!" after the crowd of 40,220 had dwindled by the eighth inning.	Didi Gregorius hit a three-run homer and knocked in four for the Yankees, who can fall back on their lead in the wild-card race. But they want to win the AL East and avoid the win-or-go-home scenario of a wild-card game.	Handed an 8-1 lead, Price (15-5) lasted only five innings because he needed 96 pitches to get that far.	"We figured, you know what? If we can't protect a seven-run lead, we don't deserve to win," Gibbons said. "And our bullpen was rested."	The ace left-hander struck out seven and improved to 6-1 with a 2.28 ERA since the Blue Jays acquired him in a July 30 trade with Detroit. He has defeated the Yankees twice in three starts with Toronto.	Price is 6-0 with a 2.01 ERA in his last eight starts at Yankee Stadium.	Severino (3-3) gave up a double to his first batter and stumbled to his knees on his fifth pitch. He flexed his left leg as manager Joe Girardi and a trainer came out to check on him, but Severino threw one warmup pitch and remained in the game.	"I just think he caught his spike. It scared me probably more than it probably scared him," Girardi said. "You can have some pretty bad thoughts go through your mind in a situation like that, but he's OK."	Then the 21-year-old right-hander really took a tumble.	Donaldson hit a mammoth drive into the elevated concrete bleachers in left field for his 38th homer. Encarnacion doubled and scored on Troy Tulowitzki's single before Smoak homered to right.	Martin, who had three of Toronto's 16 hits, added an RBI single in the third.	"My location with my fastball wasn't there," said Severino, who had a wrap on his lower right leg. "Not cut, just hurt a little bit."	Encarnacion, who has reached base safely in a club-record 40 consecutive games, took a long look at his two-run clout in the fourth off Chris Martin that landed in the rarely reached second deck in left.	Alex Rodriguez struck out all four times up for the Yankees, drawing boos.	RIGHT AT HOME	Toronto won its fifth straight at Yankee Stadium for the first time since 2003 and improved to 9-4 against New York this year. ... Each of the top seven batters in Toronto's lineup had at least two hits.	MVP NUMBERS	Donaldson has hit 13 homers in the first inning, a team record. All but 12 of his long balls this season have tied the game or given Toronto the lead.	MIGHTY IN THE `PEN	Toronto lefty Brett Cecil struck out three in 1 1/3 innings, extending his scoreless streak to a career-high 23 2/3 innings -- the longest current run in the AL and the best by an AL reliever all season.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: Rookie 2B Devon Travis (left shoulder) was transferred to the 60-day DL when Toronto activated RHP Marcus Stroman (knee) from the 60-day DL and recalled RHP Chad Jenkins from Triple-A Buffalo. Eligible to return on Sept. 27, Travis has been taking dry swings and making some progress, a Blue Jays spokesman said. But the team isn't sure Travis will make it back this season.	Yankees: 1B Mark Teixeira will miss the rest of the season after a third round of tests finally revealed a broken right leg.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays: RHP Marco Estrada (12-8) starts the opener Saturday, with Stroman making his season debut in the second game. The 24-year-old Stroman, who had surgery in March to repair a torn ACL in his left knee, went 11-6 with a 3.65 ERA as a rookie last season. He grew up on Long Island, about 55 miles from Yankee Stadium, and said he's leaving around 20 passes for friends and family Saturday. Stroman completed his sociology degree this year while rehabbing his knee at Duke, where he played college ball.	Yankees: RHP Michael Pineda (10-8) gets the ball in the first game Saturday. RHP Ivan Nova (6-7) makes his 1	00th major league start in the nightcap.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PITTSBURGH --  The Pittsburgh Pirates finally beat the Milwaukee Brewers.	Chris Stewart had three hits and three RBI, and Charlie Morton pitched six strong innings as the Pirates won 6-3, ending their seven-game losing streak against the Brewers.	"Regardless of who we're playing, we have to win," Morton said. "We're a good team. We can beat anybody and we've just got to win."	The Pirates pulled within four games of St. Louis for first place in the NL Central. The Cardinals had their game at Cincinnati suspended in the eighth inning tied 2-2.	Stewart hit a two-run single that capped a three-run fourth inning that put the Pirates ahead for good 3-2. The backup catcher, starting for resting Francisco Cervelli, added an RBI single in the sixth.	Stewart tied his career high with his third three-hit game of the season and the fifth of his nine-year career.	"Sometimes smart hitting is just finding the holes in the infield," Stewart said with a smile. "That's how it was for me tonight."	Morton (9-7) snapped a three-start losing streak, allowing two runs and three hits while walking two and striking out two.	Mark Melancon struck out two in a perfect ninth for his 45th save in 47 chances.	The Brewers had been unbeaten against the Pirates since the All-Star break, sweeping two three-game series at Milwaukee and winning the opener of the four-game series Thursday night.	Jimmy Nelson (11-12) lost for just the second time in six decisions against the Pirates this season, giving up four runs and four hits in five-plus innings with three walks and two strikeouts.	Adam Lind hit a two-run home run, his 19th, in the first inning off Morton after Elian Herrera doubled to stake the Brewers to an early lead. Logan Schafer had two hits for Milwaukee.	The Pirates stretched their lead to 6-2 in the seventh inning when Jung Ho Kang hit an RBI double and scored on a sacrifice fly by Neil Walker.	Hernan Perez had a pinch-hit RBI single in the eighth for the Brewers, who loaded the bases before Tony Watson got pinch-hitter Ryan Braun to hit an inning-ending groundout.	"(Watson) kept the game in place," Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said. "He is very resilient, so solid and very effective against very good hitters. We needed a stop right there and he gave it to us."	Jordy Mercer drove in the Pirates' first run with an infield single in the fourth when Nelson walked the bases loaded and also gave up Stewart's two-run single.	"I just didn't command the ball the way I was supposed to," Nelson said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Brewers: C Jonathan Lucroy (concussion) missed his third straight game and will be examined Saturday by concussion specialist Mickey Collins at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.	Pirates: LF Starling Marte (left shoulder discomfort) was held out of the lineup after being hit by a pitch from Brewers RHP Wily Peralta on Thursday night but entered the game in the seventh inning as a defensive replacement.	THIRD AT FIRST	Pirates 3B Aramis Ramirez made the third start at first base of his 18-year career, all coming within the last four games. Pedro Alvarez was on the bench again.	DAY OF REST	Braun, normally the right fielder, and shortstop Jean Segura were rested. The Brewers beat the Pirates in 13 innings on Thursday night in a game that lasted four hours, 44 minutes and came on the heels of a game Wednesday night at Miami followed by an early morning arrival in Pittsburgh.	UP NEXT	Brewers: LHP Zach Davies (1-0, 3.97 ERA) will make his third major league start Saturday night and is coming off his first victory Monday in which he held the Marlins to one run in seven innings.	Pirates: LHP Jeff Locke (7-10, 4.56 ERA) is 1-4 with a 5.65 ERA in his last seven starts.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

MIAMI -- The Washington Nationals' untimely slump left even Bryce Harper flailing Friday.	The NL batting leader struck out three times and stranded five runners, and the Washington Nationals lost their fourth straight game, 2-1 to the Miami Marlins.	"Bryce has had a fantastic year for us," manager Matt Williams said. "He had a couple of opportunities tonight, and it didn't happen for him. We'll try to give him those opportunities again."	Shorthanded Washington out-hit the Marlins 7-5 but went 0 for 6 with runners in scoring position, and the Nationals' lone run was unearned.	Washington, swept in a three-game series by the Mets earlier this week, fell 8 1-2 games behind first-place New York, which beat Atlanta 5-1, in the NL East.	"It's not over yet," said Gio Gonzalez, who allowed one run in 5 1/3 innings. "Things change -- a lucky rabbit's foot or something comes through. We're going to stay positive most of the time. We still have a lot of fight in us."	Mike Dunn (2-5) struck out Harper, the only batter he faced, with two on to end the seventh and keep the score 1-all.	J.T. Realmuto led off the bottom of the seventh with a double off Casey Janssen (1-5). After the Nationals misplayed a sacrifice bunt, Realmuto scored the tie-breaking run on a sacrifice fly by Miguel Rojas.	"A little unlucky, I feel like," Janssen said.	Jarred Cosart, sidelined much of the season because of vertigo, pitched five shutout innings for Miami before departing for a pinch-hitter. His last pitch might have been his best: He struck out Harper swinging on a nasty breaking ball with two runners on to end the fifth.	Dunn, a left-hander, came on to face the left-handed hitting Harper with two on and two outs in the seventh, and struck him out swinging on a 95 mph fastball. Harper is 2 for 17 lifetime against Dunn.	"He and Dunn have a history," Marlins manager Dan Jennings said. "In that situation it was the right time for Dunn. He made the quality pitches that he needed to make."	A.J. Ramos pitched around a two-out walk in the ninth for his 26th save in 32 chances.	ANNIVERSARY TRIBUTE	Rolf Koehler, a first responder on 9/11 as a member of the NYPD, was introduced between innings along with his son, Marlins pitcher Tom Koehler.	ROSTER MOVE	Before the game, the Nationals recalled RHP Taylor Jordan (0-2, 5.29) from Triple-A Syracuse for his fourth stint in the majors this year.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Nationals: 1B Ryan Zimmerman (left oblique), sidelined since Monday, again sat out and may miss at least a few more games. "The experience with obliques is that it takes a while," Williams said. "We're trying to get him to the point where he can swing a bat." ... 2B Danny Espinosa, who hurt his right wrist fielding a ball Wednesday, also sat out. ... 1B-OF Clint Robinson missed the game to be with his wife, who was about to deliver a baby.	Marlins: RF Giancarlo Stanton (left hand) hit in an inside cage before the game and showed progress, Jennings said. ... SS Adeiny Hechavarria (left hamstring) is improving and might be available to play within a week, Jennings said.	UP NEXT	Marlins RHP Jose Fernandez, returning from a right biceps strain that has sidelined him since Aug. 7, will try to become only the third pitcher since 1914 to win his first 16 career home decisions. Fernandez (4-0, 2.30) is 15-0 at Marlins Park with an ERA of 1.14. ... RHP Tanner Roark (4-4, 4.41) will start for the Nationals.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  The Tampa Bay Rays started a last chance 10-game homestand with a comeback win.	Asdrubal Cabrera and J.P. Arencibia hit two-run homers in a five-run eighth inning and the Rays beat the Boston Red Sox 8-4 on Friday night.	"Exciting win," Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash said. "This was a good one, a big one."	The Rays are five games back of second AL wild-card leader Texas, but would have to pass over the Rangers, Minnesota, the Los Angeles Angels and Cleveland for the spot.	After Logan Forsythe had an RBI single, Cabrera made it 6-4 on his drive to center off Junichi Tazawa (2-7).	"It was mislocation, missing high on the hits they were getting," Tazawa said through an interpreter. "I think that's been something that's been a problem. Just mechanics, release point."	Arencibia then gave Tampa Bay an 8-4 lead with his fifth homer in 34 at-bats since being called up Triple-A Durham on Aug. 26.	"Honestly for me, the biggest thing is to give us a four-run lead there," Arencibia said.	Andrew Bellatti (3-1) pitched a scoreless eighth for the win.	Boston slugger David Ortiz remained two homers shy of becoming the 27th player to reach 500. He had an RBI double and a single in four at-bats. He was also intentionally walked.	Enny Romero replaced starter Chris Archer with two on and no outs in the sixth and gave up a run-scoring double to Travis Shaw and Pablo Sandoval's RBI infield single that tied it at 3. Ryan Hanigan gave Boston a 4-3 lead with a sacrifice fly off Brandon Gomes.	Evan Longoria had an RBI double and Steven Souza Jr., back in the lineup after missing 34 games with a broken left hand, hit a run-scoring single during a three-run first that put Tampa Bay up 3-1. Longoria has driven in 11 runs over his last 10 games.	The Red Sox took a 1-0 lead on Ortiz's double to deep center in the first. He moved past Chipper Jones into sole possession of 32nd place all-time with his 1,624th RBI.	Archer lasted five-plus innings despite a stretch where he tied a team record with seven consecutive strikeouts. He ended up allowing three runs, five hits, two walks and struck out eight.	"I battled," Archer said. "Mission No. 1 everytime I take the mound is to get a team win and we did that. I'm happy."	Wade Miley allowed three runs and seven hits over seven innings for Boston.	Boston's Mookie Betts extended his career-high hitting streak to 16 games with a seventh-inning single.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: 2B Brock Holt left after six innings with upper back spasms and is day to day. ... 2B Dustin Pedroia got a scheduled day off after playing two straight games after missing 42 with a strained right hamstring.	Rays: OF Desmond Jennings (left knee) and C Curt Casali (left hamstring) both could return next week. ... LHP Jake McGee (left knee) is throwing off a bullpen mound.	MORE BIG PAPI	Ortiz has 2,286 hits to move pass Joe Cronin for 158th place on the MLB career list. Cronin had his No. 4 retired by Boston in 1984. ... The DH moved past Dave Winfield into 20th place all-time with 1,094 extra-base hits. ... 925 of the extra-base hits have come with Boston, which ties Ortiz for third place on the team list with Dwight Evans. ... Ortiz is expected to get rested a few times during a just started nine-game road trip that includes six games on artificial turf at Tampa Bay and Toronto.	MOVING DAY	The Red Sox claimed RHP Roman Mendez off waivers from Texas and transferred closer Koji Uehara (broken right wrist) from the 15- to 60-day DL.	UP NEXT	Boston RHP Rick Porcello (7-12) and Rays LHP Matt Moore (1-3) are Saturday night's scheduled starters.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

CINCINNATI -- This was one really bad bounce for the St. Louis Cardinals.	Adam Duvall's drive to right for Cincinnati in the eighth inning bounced off the top of the wall and went over for a tiebreaking two-run homer, sending the Cardinals to a 4-2 loss to the Reds on Saturday in the completion of a game suspended Friday by rain.	Eugenio Suarez singled with one out before Duvall connected on a 1-0 pitch from former Reds reliever Jonathan Broxton (2-5). Duvall's third homer since joining the Reds on Aug. 31 and sent the NL Central-leading Cardinals to their fifth loss in six games.	"There are times when every decision is right and times when you have to work harder," St. Louis manager Mike Matheny said. "This is one of those times when we have to work harder."	All three of Duvall's hits since joining Cincinnati have been homers.	"It was down," Broxton said of the pitch. "When I was playing here, I didn't see any balls go out like that. It kept going and going and going. It was weird."	Duvall's strength impressed manager Bryan Price.	"Wow, think of the kind of strength that takes to hit one like that that carries out that way," he said.	J.J. Hoover (8-1) pitched the eighth for the win. Aroldis Chapman struck out the side to earn his 30th save.	Heavy rain forced Friday's game to be suspended in the top of the eighth inning. Pinch-runner Pete Kozma was on first base after Suarez dropped a routine popup to shortstop on the last play before umpires called for the tarp.	The teams waited out the 17th rain delay at Great American Ball Park for an hour and seven minutes before it was suspended. It was Cincinnati's second suspended game this season and first at home. Three home games have been rained out.	Reds first baseman Joey Votto struck out and walked three times. He received a two-game suspension on Friday for an altercation with umpire Bill Welke, but will keep playing until his appeal is heard.	Michael Lorenzen gave up two runs in five innings in the 42nd consecutive start by a rookie for the Reds, passing the 1902 Cardinals for the major league record. The Reds have gone with an all-rookie rotation since trading Johnny Cueto and Mike Leake in July.	Billy Hamilton got the Reds off to a nice start in the first. He reached on a bunt single, swiped second and advanced to third on catcher Yadier Molina's wild throw for an error. Hamilton then scored on Brandon Phillips' infield single.	Cincinnati catcher Ramon Cabrera added his first major league homer in the second.	The Cardinals repeatedly wasted scoring opportunities, stranding runners in scoring position during the first three innings. Also, Jon Jay was thrown out at third base while trying to stretch a double with no outs in the fourth.	Pitcher John Lackey had an RBI groundout in the second, and Greg Garcia homered in the fourth. Lackey allowed seven hits in seven innings and matched his season high with 10 strikeouts.	KING'S DAY	Cincinnati Vice Mayor David Mann presented career hits leader Pete Rose with a key to the city and proclaimed Saturday "Pete Rose Day." Friday was the 30th anniversary of Rose's record-setting hit. A Rose bobblehead helped attract a sellout crowd.	SUSPENDED	Cardinals C Cody Stanley was suspended for 80 games for testing positive for a performance-enhancing substance.	Stanley, 26, spent most of this season at Triple-A Memphis, but was promoted to St. Louis when major league rosters expanded on Sept. 1. It is the seventh suspension announced this year under the big league program.	Major League Baseball said Stanley tested positive for dehydrochlormethyltestosterone. The suspension is effective immediately.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: RHP Matt Belisle was reinstated from the disabled list on Saturday. Belisle had been out since June 26 with right elbow inflammation.	Reds: Hamilton's two stolen bases were his first since Aug. 18. He was activated from the disabled list on Tuesday after missing 19 games with a sprained right shoulder.	UP NEXT	Cardinals: Lance Lynn (11-9) is coming off one of his worst starts. He lasted only 2 1/3 innings and gave up six runs -- matching his season high -- during a 9-0 loss to the Cubs. He Is 7-3 career against the Reds with a 3.51 ERA.	Reds: Anthony DeSclafani (8-10) is 2-0 in three career appearances against the Cardinals with a 1.29 ERA, allowing two runs in 14 innings.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ATLANTA --  Yoenis Cespedes says he's just one part of the New York Mets. You can be sure it is a very large part.	The Cuban center fielder hit a home run and drove in three runs and rookie Steven Matz pitched five strong innings as the Mets won their fifth in a row with a 5-1 win over the Atlanta Braves on Friday night.	"It is not about me, it is about the team," Cespedes said through a translator. "I am one part of the team. To be producing, and seeing the team winning, and everybody chipping in for one purpose. That is to play in the playoffs and hopefully we can bring the big trophy to the city."	With Washington losing to Miami 2-1, the Mets lead the NL East by a season-high 8 1/2 games.	"We have 21 left," said Mets manager Terry Collins. "We have to go out and play the games. We have to win games. I'll be happy when we have an 8  1/2 game lead with eight to play."	Cespedes hit a two-run homer in the ninth and had a line-drive double in the third that scored Curtis Granderson. Cespedes has seven home runs in his last 10 games and 100 RBI for the season. He has 39 RBI in 38 games with the Mets, who acquired him on July 31 from the Tigers.	"He's getting up with guys on base and he's getting big hits," Collins said. "He's a great player and a great hitter."	Matz allowed one run and six hits as he improved to 3-0 in four career starts and lowered his ERA to 1.88 against an anemic Braves offense that is last in the majors in runs. It was Matz's second start since returning from the disabled list and he felt he didn't have his command like he wanted to.	"I'm not quite where I left off, but there are spurts where I'm feeling really good on the mound," Matz said.	Rookie Matt Wisler (5-7) took the loss for the Braves after allowing two runs in five innings. Wisler has lost six straight decisions for the Braves, who have dropped 22 of their last 25 games. Atlanta has lost 10 straight at Turner Field, tying the franchise single-season home losing streak.	"Wisler was outstanding," said Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez. "He really was. He pounded the strike zone, made some good pitches when he had to."	The win was the 80th on the season for the Mets, marking the first time New York has reached that milestone since 2008.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mets: Pitching coach Dan Warthen returned to the team after missing Thursday's game and spending one night in an Atlanta hospital with a racing heartbeat. The team announced the heartbeat "corrected itself" and Warthen was back with the team Friday. . RHP Hansel Robles remains in the Dominican Republic attending to a death in the family.	Braves: OF Cameron Maybin missed his sixth straight game with an eye infection. He is day to day and available for pinch-running duty. ... RHP Ross Detwiler will be out indefinitely with a hamstring injury suffered during Thursday night's 16-pitch outing.	UP NEXT	Mets: Rookie Noah Syndergaard (8-6, 3.31) will return to the mound after his last turn was skipped. His last start was Aug. 30, when he got a no-decision in a 5-4 win over the Red Sox. Syndergaard lost to the Braves on June 20, giving up four runs in four innings during a 6-4 defeat.	Braves: Rookie Williams Perez (5-6, 5.42) opposed Syndergaard on June 20 and picked up the win, surrendering four runs in six innings.	REMEMBERING 9/11	The Braves and Mets wore caps honoring New York City First Responders during batting practice and caps with American flags on the side during the game to commemorate the anniversary of the terrorist attacks in 2001. The Braves and Mets were involved in one of baseball's memorable moments 10 days after the attacks. On Sept. 21, 2001, Mike Piazza hit a two-run homer in the eighth inning to lift the Mets to a 3-2 win over the Braves in the first major sporting event to be held in the city.	BOURN SUPREMACY	Center fielder Michael Bourn made the best of three stellar defensive plays by the Braves. In the fifth inning, Bourn made a leaping catch and crashed into the wall on a ball hit by Michael Conforto that appeared headed well over his head. Castro made an outstanding stop one batter later, diving to prevent what appeared to be a base hit to center field by Ruben Tejada. In the fourth, Freeman saved a run with an outstanding stop on a hard grounder by Daniel Murphy.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- Colby Lewis simply jogged to his spot for defensive positioning after giving up the hit that ended his bid for a perfect game in the eighth inning.	And when the 36-year-old wrapped up the most dominant shutout by a Texas right-hander at home since Nolan Ryan's record seventh no-hitter 24 years ago, he turned straight-faced to catcher Chris Gimenez for a quick hug.	No big deal, this two-hitter for a 4-0 victory over the Oakland Athletics on Friday night.	"I don't know. Like, I guess on any given night, but I don't look at myself like having no-hitter or perfect-game stuff," said Lewis (15-8), who beat his previous career high in wins from 2011, the last of two straight seasons that the Rangers went to the World Series.	"I was like, 'Whatever.'"	The home crowd wasn't. The fans gave him a standing ovation after Danny Valencia's leadoff double down the left-field line in the eighth. They did it again when he finished the inning by striking out Max Muncy to strand Valencia at third.	And they were standing, clapping and chanting "Colby!" when he got Mark Canha on a fielder's choice to shortstop Elvis Andrus to finish the shutout. Josh Phegley opened the ninth with a sharp single off third baseman Adrian Beltre's glove.	Mitch Moreland snapped an 18-inning scoreless streak for Texas with a two-run double in a three-run first inning off Oakland starter Jesse Chavez (7-15).	The Rangers moved within 1 1/2 games of AL West-leading Houston and maintained a one-game edge on Minnesota for the second wild card. The Astros lost to the Los Angeles Angels 3-2, and the Twins beat the Chicago White Sox 6-2.	Lewis needed just 97 pitches, and the 21 straight batters retired to start the game were the most for a Texas pitcher since Yu Darvish got the first 26 before Marwin Gonzalez's two-out single in the ninth for Houston on April 2, 2013.	Lewis, a veteran of 11 major league seasons -- and two in Japan to try to get his career back on track -- was 0-3 with an 8.62 in his past three starts.	"The things that he's gone through and the resilience that he has, I've got to believe, a pretty tough cat," Texas manager Jeff Banister said. "I don't think you're going to push him around much."	Lewis said he noticed Valencia tipping his batting helmet to him as he stood on second base.	"When you are witnessing great things happening, there's a mutual respect," Valencia said. "He was very competitive tonight."	DEFENSIVE GEMS	Lewis got great defensive plays from center Delino DeShields in the fourth inning and second baseman Rougned Odor in the sixth to keep the bid alive.	DeShields, back in the lineup after missing three games when he injured his left knee on a slide in Seattle, made a diving catch in shallow center on a soft line drive from Josh Reddick. Odor was already playing a shift in shallow right field when Muncy hit a line drive that sent him running deeper into right, where he made a running, leaping catch.	"What a fun game to watch all the way around," Banister said. "Between Colby, the defense and some of the timely hitting. Fun defensive plays out there for Colby."	CLOSE CALLS	Lewis twice went to three-ball counts when he still had the perfect game. No. 9 hitter Eric Sogard flied to right to end the sixth after getting ahead 3-0, and Reddick flew out to left on a 3-1 pitch to end the seventh.	TRAINERS ROOM	Athletics: CF Billy Burns was scratched from the leadoff spot because of right hamstring tightness. ... Manager Bob Melvin said there was no timetable for C Stephen Vogt's return. He was hit in the groin by a foul tip Sunday. Melvin said Vogt would probably be a DH before he was behind the plate again. ... RHP Chris Bassitt (shoulder) threw at 105 feet and should be close to a bullpen session.	Rangers: OF Josh Hamilton had arthroscopic surgery to repair a slight meniscus tear in his left knee, and there's still a chance he could play again this season. It would likely be as a pinch-hitter.	UP NEXT	Athletics: LHP Sean Nolin (0-1, 4.50), part of the offseason trade that sent Josh Donaldson to Toronto, makes his second start after giving up five hits and three runs in six innings in a 3-2 loss to Seattle in his debut for the A's.	Rangers: RHP Yovani Gallardo (12-9, 3.16) is set for his 30th start, which would be his seventh straight season with at least 30. The others were with Milwaukee. He has won five straight decisions, his longest since a career-best streak of eight straight in 2012.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CHICAGO --  Trevor Plouffe picked a perfect time to rediscover his home run swing.	Plouffe hit a pair of solo homers, including a tie-breaking shot in the eighth, to lead the Minnesota Twins to a 6-2 win over the Chicago White Sox on Friday night.	Eduardo Escobar added a solo shot in the Twins' three-run ninth as Minnesota remained one game behind Texas for the second American League wild card.	Plouffe hadn't gone deep in 20 games and not since Aug. 17 at New York. He struck out with the bases loaded in the first inning in this one, but then launched his 19th and 20th homers.	The second one barely made it into the White Sox bullpen, but put the Twins ahead 3-2.	"I just wanted to come through," Plouffe said. "I was upset after that first at-bat when I had the bases loaded with one out and didn't get the job done.	"After that I'm just trying to have good at bats and today I was able to to hit a few balls out of the park."	Plouffe also had a single in the ninth to give him three hits and three RBI. Plouffe's second homer came off Nate Jones (1-2), the second Chicago reliever, and gave the Twins infielder his third career multi-homer game.	"He's become a pretty good pro," manager Paul Molitor said. "It's been a little bit lean for him. but 20's a nice number."	Ervin Santana came through with his third straight strong start, allowing two runs, on Adam Eaton's 13th homer in the fifth, through seven innings, while scattering six hits and striking out six. In his last three outings, Santana (5-4) has allowed just three earned runs in 22 innings and struck out 27.	"I just want to get one out at a time and one pitch at a time and it works," Santana said.	Santana got help from 40-year-old right fielder Torii Hunter, who threw out two runners in a game for the first time since September 2012. Hunter also had two hits, including an RBI double.	"It's been awhile since somebody tested (his arm), so it was a lot of fun that they were testing it today and I was able to let loose and throw," Hunter said.	Chicago's Erik Johnson labored in his second start since being recalled from Triple-A Charlotte on Sept. 1, but allowed just one run on four hits in a no-decision. He won at Kansas City on Sunday, but struggled with control in this one.	The righty walked five, but wriggled out of serious trouble thanks to six strikeouts and some good defense.	Johnson escaped a bases-loaded jam in the first without allowing any runs when Avisail Garcia jumped high against the right-field fence and caught Eddie Rosario's liner for the third out.	Plouffe lined his first homer to left to lead off the fourth and put Minnesota ahead 1-0. Hunter threw Garcia out at the plate to end the bottom half of the inning when he tried to score from second on Rob Brantly's single.	Eaton's two run shot to center with one out in the fifth moved Chicago in front, 2-1, but Hunter's RBI double in sixth tied it at 2-all.	He had never hit more than three homers in any of his three previous seasons in the majors.	NO SURPRISE	The Twins are in the thick of the wild-card hunt after finishing 70-92 last season. Did Molitor foresee that improvement at the start of the season?	"I wouldn't have discarded it as folly," he said. "But being a part of the team last year, 70-92 didn't seem a very accurate portrayal of the way we played the majority of the year.	"Between the (AL wild-card) scenario, the development of young players and veterans showing leadership, it's just something that that's transpired over the course of 135 games."	GREEN-HORN	White Sox LHP John Danks took the field for pregame warmups wearing a full, bright-green leprechaun costume, complete with a hat.	Danks was paying up on a bet he made with White Sox radio announcer Ed Farmer on the Texas-Notre Dame football game last week. Danks, a native of Austin and fan of Texas football, bet on the Longhorns. They lost 38-3 to the Fighting Irish.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Twins: RHP Phil Hughes (back inflammation) may rejoin Minnesota's rotation next Tuesday against Detroit, manager Paul Molitor said before Friday's game. Hughes (10-8) threw a 45-pitch simulated game on Wednesday and will toss a bullpen session on Saturday. He hasn't pitched since a lopsided loss at Cleveland on Aug. 9.	C Kurt Suzuki started after leaving Wednesday's game at Kansas City in the 10th inning with a bruised knee, suffered when the Royals Jarrod Dyson collided with him at home plate. Suzuki said he has no structural damage and that his "contusion" is being treated with ice and electical stimulation. . The Twins activated right-handed reliever J.R. Graham (shoulder inflammation) from the disabled list prior to Friday night's game.	UP NEXT:	Minnesota left-hander Tommy Milone (8-4, 3.54) faces Chicago lefty Jose Quintana (8-10, 3.60 ERA) on Saturday night in the second game of the series. Milone is 3-0 with a 0.87 ERA in three starts against the White Sox this season.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

PHILADELPHIA --  Jake Arrieta didn't feel on top of his game. He still displayed dominance that has him among the leading NL Cy Young Award candidates.	Arrieta pitched eight strong innings for his major league-leading 19th win, and Starlin Castro homered to lead the Chicago Cubs past the Philadelphia Phillies 5-1 in the first game of a doubleheader Friday night.	In the second game, Kyle Schwarber homered twice to lead the Cubs to a 7-3 win and a sweep of the doubleheader.	Arrieta said his timing was off, but it didn't prohibit him from shutting down the Phillies.	"Sometimes your body reacts differently on certain nights and it's hard to get into that rhythm," he said. "The adjustment necessary to have a quality outing can be made regardless of how you feel."	Arrieta (19-6) won his eighth straight start, allowing six hits with seven strikeouts and two walks to become the first Cubs pitcher to win that many in a row since Milt Pappas won 11 consecutive games in 1972. In his last 16 starts dating to June 21, the right-hander is 13-1 with a 1.00 ERA and 115 strikeouts in 117 innings. He lowered his season ERA to 1.99.	"Nothing fazes me," Arrieta said. "Men on base, walks, homers. ... Deal with it and move forward."	While Arrieta deflected questions about possible upcoming milestones, manager Joe Maddon didn't back away from Cy Young talk.	"I definitely believe our guy deserves it, no question," Maddon said. "I've seen (Zack) Greinke pitch. I know he's really good. I'm getting to watch Jake in person; it's pretty spectacular to watch. My vote's for Jake."	Addison Russell hit a two-run double and Kris Bryant set a club rookie record in the opener with his 87th RBI for Chicago, which entered play nine games ahead of San Francisco for the second NL wild-card spot. The Cubs have won seven of their last eight.	Bryant homered, had three hits and drove in three runs in the nightcap to up his RBI total to 90. He leads all major league rookies in the category.	Aaron Altherr homered in the first game for Philadelphia, which has lost 14 of 18. Ryan Howard snapped an 0-for-35 skid, the worst slump of his career, with a seventh-inning double in the second game.	"That was nice to see," Phillies interim manager Pete Mackanin said of Howard snapping the skid. "It happens to the best of them. We're just hoping he's going to get hot again."	The nightcap was necessitated by Thursday night's rainout.	The only blemish for Arrieta was Altherr's second-inning solo homer, which halted his streak of consecutive innings without an earned run at 30 2-3.	Adam Morgan (5-6) allowed four runs and seven hits in five-plus innings.	"I got some balls over the plate and they're a good-hitting team," Morgan said.	The Cubs went ahead with two two-out runs in the fifth. Dexter Fowler tied the game at 1 when he scored from first on Austin Jackson's double to left, and Jackson reached on Bryant's double to right.	Philadelphia played its first game since Thursday's firing of general manager Ruben Amaro Jr.	In the second game, Kyle Hendricks (7-6) gave up three runs and four hits in 6 2/3 innings to earn the win in his first-ever start against Philadelphia.	Alec Asher (0-3), making his third start since the Phillies acquired him in the trade that sent Cole Hamels to Texas, allowed six runs and seven hits in five innings. Asher has allowed 17 earned runs in 14 1/3 innings.	Hector Rendon relieved Fernando Rodney with two on and no outs in the ninth and got his 28th save in 32 chances.	The win keeps the Cubs in excellent shape to make the playoffs for the first time since 2008.	"Everybody's thinking about October," Hendricks said. "We can smell it."	RBI MAN	Bryant eclipsed Billy Williams (1961) and Geovany Soto (2008), who each had 86 RBI as rookies.	"It just shows, when there's people on base he becomes an even better hitter," Maddon said. "You get guys with that mentality, it makes all the difference in the world."	CASTRO CRUISING	Castro, who lost his role as an everyday player to 21-year-old shortstop Russell, belted his eighth homer with two outs in the seventh. It was the 13th RBI in 17 games in Philadelphia for Castro, who is 9 for 16 in his last five games overall. He rested in the nightcap.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Phillies: Mackanin said 3B Maikel Franco (fractured left wrist) will take live batting practice "in a few days." Mackanin is eyeing Sept. 22 at Miami as a possibility for Franco, who has been on the DL since Aug. 12, to rejoin the club.	UP NEXT	RHP Dan Haren (9-9, 3.73) takes the mound for the Cubs on Saturday night against Phillies RHP Jerad Eickhoff (1-3, 4.70).	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

PHOENIX -- Welington Castillo, Paul Goldschmidt and Nick Ahmed homered for the Arizona Diamondbacks, who cruised to a 12-4 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Friday night.	Ahmed went 4 for 4 with three RBI, including two doubles and two runs scored. The Diamondbacks won for the third time in four games, with four pitchers combining to hold the Dodgers to four hits.	The last of the four hits was a grand slam by Justin Ruggiano in the top of the ninth inning with two outs.	Castillo's towering drive far over the wall in left-center gave Arizona 3-0 lead, and Chris Owings' triple drove in Phil Gosselin with the fourth run of the inning off Dodgers starter Alex Wood.	The Diamondbacks added six runs in the second. Goldschmidt made it 6-0 with a two-run shot down the left-field line. He continues to punish Dodgers' pitching, hitting.336 (91 for 271) with 18 home runs and 59 RBI in 70 career games against Los Angeles.	Wood (10-10) lasted only 1 2/3 innings, allowing six earned runs and eight hits in his shortest outing since coming to the Dodgers in a trade on July 30.	The other runs in the sixth came on a two-run double by Yasmany Tomas off reliever Pedro Baez and Ahmed's two-run homer. Arizona sent nine batters to the plate in each the first two innings.	Every Arizona position player had at least one hit through the first two innings, and rookie Peter O'Brien collected his first major league hit in the sixth, an RBI single. Starter Robbie Ray (4-11) shut out the Dodgers for five innings for his first win since July 7 and first career win at home, ending a streak of 10 straight starts overall without a victory.	The Dodgers absorbed their worst loss since a 15-2 defeat to the New York Mets on July 25 and their division lead slid to 7 1/2 games over the San Francisco Giants in the NL West.	UMPIRE LEAVES GAME	Home plate umpire Jim Wolf left the game after two innings, the result of being hit in the mask by a foul ball off Ahmed's bat. There was a delay before the start of the third inning to allow first base umpire Alan Porter to change into gear and take over behind home plate, leaving a three-man crew.	REMEMBERING 9/11	Two lines of Marines totaling 250 in all stood along the foul lines in left and right field before the game for the national anthem, and both teams wore American flag patches on their caps. A moment of silence was observed before the game in remembrance of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: Alex Guerrero, brought in to pinch-hit in the third inning, left the game with what was announced as a left calf strain after beating out an infield single and reaching first base. He was replaced by pinch-runner Jimmy Rollins.	Diamondbacks: RHP Jeremy Hellickson was reinstated from the 15-day DL. He had been out since Aug. 20 with a strained left hamstring, and is in line to start Monday against San Diego at home.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: RHP Mike Bolsinger makes his second big league start since July and goes against his former team, the Diamondbacks, on Saturday. Bolsinger, called up from Triple-A on Sept. 1 after spending the previous month in the minors, is 2-0 with a 2.45 ERA in his last six road starts. He's 6-3 with a 2.97 ERA overall.	DIAMONDBACKS: RHP Rubby De La Rosa is also facing his former team on Saturday. De La Rosa (12-7, 4.41 ERA) took a no-hitter into the fifth inning in his last start, Sept. 6 at the Chicago Cubs.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  At the moment, the Los Angeles Angels have their sights set on overtaking two teams in the race for the AL's second wild card berth.	But with the West-leading Houston Astros in town for a three-game series, and another three-game set at Minute Maid Park during the third week of September, the Angels don't mind giving the impression that they are aiming higher.	On Friday night, the Angels parlayed a fielding error by Astros pitcher Dallas Keuchel into three unearned runs in the second inning and went on to beat Houston 3-2, putting them within 4 1-2 games of first place.	"It's obviously an important series, and the only way we get these guys where we need them is to beat them," winning pitcher Jered Weaver said. "We don't have to scoreboard watch when when they're on our field, so it's a big win. Hopefully we can take another two out of this series and make things pretty interesting."	Weaver (7-10) allowed two runs and five hits in six innings, struck out seven and walked two en route to his 138th career victory, which tied Nolan Ryan for second place on the Angels' career list behind Chuck Finley's 165.	"I'm just making strides to get back to where I know I can be, and I felt good tonight," Weaver said after his seventh start off the disabled list. "Obviously, going up against a guy like Dallas, you know runs are going to be scarce. So I just tried to bear down and limit runners. We were able to scratch out three runs in the second and were able to hold them off after that."	The last time Weaver faced Houston, he beat them 2-0 with a complete-game six-hitter on May 8 at the "Big A."	"This is a tough place to play and Weaver has our number. So I knew going in I was going to have be pretty good," Keuchel (17-7) said. "I thought I was pretty good  -- except for that one play."	The left-hander, who last year became the first Astros pitcher ever to win a Gold Glove, committed his first error in 62 chances this season and the Angels turned it into a three-run second inning.	"With a guy like Keuchel, on the mound, there's not many mistakes that he's going to make," Angels right fielder Kole Calhoun said. "He's had an unbelievable season and they've been playing well, so we've got to go out and battle every pitch."	Keuchel jumped about a foot off the mound to field a comebacker by Taylor Featherston and misplayed it, loading the bases after a one-out double by Erick Aybar and a two-out walk to Carlos Perez.	"It's a routine play that I just botched. I mean I can't really say anything else," Keuchel said. "It had a lot of topspin. It's not like I haven't made that play before. That was the difference in the game -- a routine play that I missed and that was the difference. So it's frustrating and it doesn't sit very well. It's a tough one to swallow."	Aybar came home on a wild pitch -- the 17th run the Angels have scored that way this season -- and Calhoun followed with a two-run single that increased his career-high RBI total to 75.	The Astros closed to 3-2 in the sixth on Carlos Gomez's fourth homer, a towering drive to left-center after Weaver walked Carlos Correa with one out and got behind Gomez 2-0. Weaver struck out the next two batters before manager Mike Scioscia went to the bullpen.	Fernando Salas and Joe Smith each pitched a hitless inning and Huston Street retired the side in order in the ninth for his 34th save in 38 attempts. The Angels remained three games behind Texas and two behind Minnesota in the race for the second wild card spot.	Keuchel gave up five hits through six innings, struck out seven and walked two.	A SLICE OF HISTORY	Jose Altuve doubled in the first inning for his 800th hit in 647 big league games, making him the fastest to reach that figure in Astros' history. The previous mark was held by Cesar Cedeno (707), who needed one fewer game than Jeff Bagwell.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: RHP Scott Feldman was diagnosed with a sprained right shoulder after undergoing an MRI in Houston on Thursday, and is done for the season. The 11-year veteran, in the second year of a three-year, $30 million deal, was 5-5 with a 3.90 ERA in 18 starts.	UP NEXT	Astros: Rookie RHP Lance McCullers (5-5) is 1/3 with a 4.15 ERA over his last eight starts. The only victory during that stretch was a 6-3 decision against the Angels.	Angels: LHP Hector Santiago (8-9) held Texas to one hit over six innings last Sunday in a 7-0 home win, following a stretch of eight starts in which he was 0-5 with a 6.46 ERA.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

SEATTLE --  Colorado rookie Dustin Garneau learned quickly from a previous mistake.	Garneau snapped a 0-0 tie with a three-run homer in the seventh and Chad Bettis allowed three hits over seven innings, leading the Rockies to a 4-2 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Friday night.	"It was a little front-door cutter," said Garneau, who was called up from Triple-A Albuquerque in mid-August and now finds himself the most veteran catcher because of injuries to Nick Hundley and Michael McKenry. "He got me my at-bat before where I popped out to the catcher. So, I took a chance and luckily I got my barrel to it."	Bettis (7-5), making his fourth start since coming off the disabled list, struck out six and walked three.	"Honestly, everything was working out for me right out of the gate. It's really nice to have that feeling going into this game," Bettis said. "I felt Garneau and I did a really good job before the game on coming up with a plan on how to attack these guys."	The Rockies had three hits through six innings before breaking through against Hisashi Iwakuma (7-4). After DJ LeMahiue grounded out, Justin Morneau and Ben Paulsen had consecutive singles. Garneau then ripped the first pitch over the wall in left for his second homer, snapping a streak of 24 1/3 scoreless innings by Seattle pitchers.	"I don't think he hit a wall, he elevated some pitches," Mariners manager Lloyd McClendon said. "The one bad pitch was a back-up slider. He was throwing extremely well until then. For some reason, he just left some pitches up and in."	Seattle cut the lead to 3-2 in the eighth off Christian Friedrich when pinch-hitter Shawn O'Malley walked to open the inning and Kyle Seager followed with his 24th home run.	"It was a pitch up and in the zone a little bit, something I could hit and fortunately it worked out," said Seager, who has seven homers in his last 16 games.	The Rockies added a run in the ninth on singles by Daniel Descalso and Charlie Blackmon and a two-out wild pitch by Tony Zych.	After Justin Miller, Boone Logan and Jairo Diaz combined to finish the eighth for Colorado, John Axford pitched the ninth for his 22nd save in 27 opportunities.	The Mariners had two on in the ninth, but Axford struck out Seager on a full-count curveball.	"It shows you that Garneau has a feel for what's going on, and it also shows a lot of nerve from Axford in that situation," Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. "He's got the big curveball. He threw one fastball and Kyle came out of his shoes on it. He saw the fastball pretty well. That's why I think he kept going back to the curveball."	Seattle had an opportunity in the sixth when James Jones singled to open and Seager walked. Nelson Cruz bounced into a double play, sending Jones to third. After Robinson Cano was walked intentionally, Bettis escaped by striking out Mark Trumbo.	"The double play was huge," Weiss said. "We stress it so much. You get two outs with one pitch. You can minimize damage."	TRAINING ROOM	Rockies: Hundley, who left Sunday's game with a stiff neck, was placed on the 60-day DL with a cervical strain. C Tom Murphy was called up from Triple-A Albuquerque.	Mariners: OF Franklin Gutierrez, who had missed the last six games with a strained right groin, struck out as a pinch-hitter in the seventh inning. "Guti's making real good progress," McClendon said before Friday's game.	LHP James Paxton, who has been out since late May with a strained finger on his pitching hand, is expected to start Sunday after experiencing no problems following a bullpen session. "It's trending toward Paxton," McClendon said. "No setbacks, not yet."	UP NEXT	Rockies: LHP Yohan Flande (3-2, 4.65 ERA) will be making his 17th appearance and ninth start. Since moving into the rotation, he is 2-1 with a 4.93 ERA. Tagged for six runs in 4 1/3 innings in his last start against San Francisco.	Mariners: LHP Roenis Elias (4-8, 4.30 ERA), will be making his fourth start since being recalled from Triple-A Tacoma on Aug. 23.  He has pitched 5 1/3 innings in each of his last two starts.	AXFORD IN A GROOVE	Axford has not allowed a run in his last nine appearances, covering 8 2/3 innings since Aug. 19. His 22 saves are the most since 2012, when had 35 with Milwaukee, which capped a three-season run when he totaled 105 saves.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Jake Peavy was surprised to learn he beat his former team for the first time. He had thought he earned one last season.	"I guess that was a no-decision," he said. "You know, I enjoy competing. I know a lot of people in that dugout. Other than that, it's just another game."	Peavy allowed two hits over seven innings, Marlon Byrd had three hits and drove in a run and the San Francisco Giants beat the San Diego Padres 9-1 on Friday night.	Matt Duffy had two hits and drove in two runs for the Giants, who have won four of six following a seven-game losing streak. Buster Posey extended his hitting streak to 11 games.	The Giants, who left 10 men on base, picked up ground on the Los Angeles Dodgers for the first time since Aug. 21. The first-place Dodgers, who lost 12-4 to Arizona, are 7 1-2 games in front in the NL West.	"We know the task at hand," Peavy said. "We're just trying to to get within striking distance and make this thing interesting."	Justin Upton homered for the Padres, who have lost six of their last eight.	Peavy (6-6) did not walk a batter and struck out two. He retired 17 straight after Upton's second-inning homer gave the Padres the early lead.	"He was good," Padres manager Pat Murphy said. "Let's face it, he's a veteran, a former Cy Young Award winner and he pitched his butt off. He made pitches and when we did hit it hard, they caught it."	Andrew Cashner (5-15) gave up five runs and nine hits over 4 2/3 innings. He walked five and struck out seven on his 29th birthday.	Angel Pagan, who robbed Matt Kemp of a home run with an over-the-fence grab in the seventh inning, singled home the tying run in the second and the Giants took the lead for good with two runs in the third on RBI singles from Posey and Byrd.	Duffy's two-run double highlighted a four-run outburst in the seventh.	BOCHY'S NIGHT	Giants manager Bruce Bochy visited the mound to talk with his son, Brett Bochy, who happened to be pitching the ninth inning. The younger Bochy had given up a hit and then hit a batter after getting the first two outs.	"That was emotional for me," the manager said. "I was caught up and I'm not going to lie. I was influenced by the crowd."	Allowing his son one more hitter, Brett Bochy struck out Jedd Gyorko to end the game as the crowd chanted "Bo-chy, Bo-chy," throughout the inning.	TRAINER'S ROOM:	Padres: RHP Shawn Kelly (strained right forearm) is expected to play long toss Saturday, with the possibility of a bullpen session next week.	Giants: OF Gregor Blanco was diagnosed with a concussion and may miss the remainder of the season. "He complained after the game in Arizona," manager Bruce Bochy said. "He thinks it's from a slide in LA when his head hit the knee of the infielder. It seemed to get worse." ... RHP Matt Cain (elbow) was reinstated from the DL and will pitch out of the bullpen for the time being.	UP NEXT:	Padres: RHP Ian Kennedy (8-13, 3.99), who starts Saturday's game, has an ERA of 2.48 over his past six starts and is 2/3 over that stretch. In four starts against the Giants this year, he's 2-1 with a 1.69 ERA.	Giants: LHP Madison Bumgarner (17-7, 3.05) is 8-2 since the All-Star break and will be looking to match his career high for wins from last year. He's 8-2 with a 2.02 ERA in 14 home starts.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

CINCINNATI -- This was one really bad bounce for the St. Louis Cardinals.	Adam Duvall's drive to right for Cincinnati in the eighth inning bounced off the top of the wall and went over for a tiebreaking two-run homer, sending the Cardinals to a 4-2 loss to the Reds on Saturday in the completion of a game suspended Friday by rain.	Eugenio Suarez singled with one out before Duvall connected on a 1-0 pitch from former Reds reliever Jonathan Broxton (2-5). Duvall's third homer since joining the Reds on Aug. 31 and sent the NL Central-leading Cardinals to their fifth loss in six games.	"There are times when every decision is right and times when you have to work harder," St. Louis manager Mike Matheny said. "This is one of those times when we have to work harder."	All three of Duvall's hits since joining Cincinnati have been homers.	"It was down," Broxton said of the pitch. "When I was playing here, I didn't see any balls go out like that. It kept going and going and going. It was weird."	Duvall's strength impressed manager Bryan Price.	"Wow, think of the kind of strength that takes to hit one like that that carries out that way," he said.	J.J. Hoover (8-1) pitched the eighth for the win. Aroldis Chapman struck out the side to earn his 30th save.	Heavy rain forced Friday's game to be suspended in the top of the eighth inning. Pinch-runner Pete Kozma was on first base after Suarez dropped a routine popup to shortstop on the last play before umpires called for the tarp.	The teams waited out the 17th rain delay at Great American Ball Park for an hour and seven minutes before it was suspended. It was Cincinnati's second suspended game this season and first at home. Three home games have been rained out.	Reds first baseman Joey Votto struck out and walked three times. He received a two-game suspension on Friday for an altercation with umpire Bill Welke, but will keep playing until his appeal is heard.	Michael Lorenzen gave up two runs in five innings in the 42nd consecutive start by a rookie for the Reds, passing the 1902 Cardinals for the major league record. The Reds have gone with an all-rookie rotation since trading Johnny Cueto and Mike Leake in July.	Billy Hamilton got the Reds off to a nice start in the first. He reached on a bunt single, swiped second and advanced to third on catcher Yadier Molina's wild throw for an error. Hamilton then scored on Brandon Phillips' infield single.	Cincinnati catcher Ramon Cabrera added his first major league homer in the second.	The Cardinals repeatedly wasted scoring opportunities, stranding runners in scoring position during the first three innings. Also, Jon Jay was thrown out at third base while trying to stretch a double with no outs in the fourth.	Pitcher John Lackey had an RBI groundout in the second, and Greg Garcia homered in the fourth. Lackey allowed seven hits in seven innings and matched his season high with 10 strikeouts.

The suspension is effective immediately.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: RHP Matt Belisle was reinstated from the disabled list on Saturday.

BALTIMORE -- The Kansas City Royals kept getting on base in front of Mike Moustakas, and he repeatedly brought them home.	And that, quite simply, is how Moustakas amassed a franchise-record nine RBIs in a 14-6 rout of the Baltimore Orioles on Saturday.	"It's pretty special," Moustakas said. "I was just able to get good pitches, and I didn't miss them today."	Moustakas hit a two-run single in the sixth inning, his second career grand slam in the seventh and, capping the unprecedented performance, a three-run homer in the ninth.	The previous team record for RBIs in a game was seven, by Billy Butler against Philadelphia on April 7, 2013.	"The guys got on base today, gave me opportunities to drive in some runs," Moustakas said. "I was able to capitalize on that."	The start was delayed by rain for 3 hours, 2 minutes, and the game lasted 3:40. By the time it was over, it was difficult for Royals manager Ned Yost to recall all that Moustakas accomplished.	"He sure had a great one today," Yost said. "A grand slam, a three-run homer. I don't know what else he did, that game was so doggone long. He had nine RBI? A four-hour game, I forgot about all of that."	Salvador Perez had two hits and three RBIs for the American League Central-leading Royals, who won for only the second time in eight games.	"It was a big win. You can't lose six out of seven like we had," Yost said. "The good thing about it is their disposition, their focus, their intensity hasn't changed through this."	Yordano Ventura (11-8) allowed four runs and eight hits in 5 2/3 innings for Kansas City. The right-hander is 7-1 in his last 10 starts, including a pair of wins over Baltimore.	Adam Jones and Nolan Reimold homered for the Orioles, whose modest three-game winning streak ended. Baltimore has 21 games left to close a significant gap in the hunt for the second AL wild card.	Baltimore was betrayed by a bullpen that yielded 10 runs and 10 hits over the final 3 1/3 innings. The relievers weren't sharp on Friday night either, when the Orioles rallied to win 14-8.	"We didn't pitch well out of the pen, obviously," manager Buck Showalter said. "A couple of games, I'm being nice when I say they weren't crisp. Both of them."	Kansas City trailed 4-1 before batting around in a five-run sixth against three pitchers. After Eric Hosmer chased starter Chris Tillman with a run-scoring single, Moustakas drove in a pair of runs with a single off Brian Matusz (1-4). Perez greeted Chaz Roe with an opposite-field, two-run single to right.	The Royals pulled away with a five-run seventh. The big blow was delivered by Moustakas, who drove an 0-2 pitch over the right-field wall after an intentional walk to Kendrys Morales filled the bases.	After Reimold got Baltimore to 11-6 with a two-run drive in the eighth, Moustakas connected off Steve Johnson in the ninth.	It was the fourth career multihomer game for Moustakas, who turned 27 on Friday night.	"What did he have, seven RBI? Nine?" Baltimore's J.J. Hardy said. "That's a pretty good month -- or week. What did we score? Not enough."	Baltimore used a sacrifice fly by Gerardo Parra and a three-run shot by Jones to build a 4-1 lead after three innings.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals: Reliever Wade Davis returned to action after being rested with shoulder soreness.	Orioles: C Matt Wieters was back in the starting lineup after missing three games with a sore left wrist. ... The Orioles hope RHP Miguel Gonzalez (right shoulder tendinitis) can come off the disabled list before the season ends. "Best scenario, he gets some starts," Showalter said. "It would certainly help his frame of mind."	UP NEXT	Royals: RHP Johnny Cueto attempts to snap a four-game losing streak in the series finale Sunday night. He is 2-5 with a 4.86 ERA in eight starts with Kansas City.	Orioles: Wei-Yin Chen beat the Royals on Aug. 26 and tries for an encore. The Taiwanese left-hander is 4-1 in his last nine starts.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.
