CLEVELAND -- Fausto Carmona changed his grip -- and finally his luck.	Using a wicked changeup to go with his sinful sinker, Carmona pitched a three-hitter for his first shutout in more than two years, slowing Minnesota's September surge and leading the Cleveland Indians to a 2-0 win over the AL Central-leading Twins on Friday night.	Carmona (12-14) had lost his last six decisions, falling 1-0 in a complete-game start against the Seattle Mariners on Sept. 3. This time he came out on top, dominating the Twins, who just completed an 8-1 homestand and lost for only the second time in nine games this month.	Carmona retired the final 16 batters, striking out four of the last six. It was his third career shutout and first since blanking the Toronto Blue Jays on May 12, 2008.	"Fausto was filthy," Indians manager Manny Acta said. "He had that good sinker, but the difference maker for him has been that changeup. They kept beating that sinker into the ground. He was fantastic."	On the advice of Cleveland coaches Tim Belcher and Scott Radinsky, Carmona slightly altered his grip three starts ago to take some velocity off his changeup. He was throwing the pitch too hard, and teams were sitting back and hitting it like it was a fastball.	The Twins flailed helplessly at it.	"We got stuffed by Carmona," Minnesota manager Ron Gardenhire said. "He dominated us. We didn't do too much against him. He ate us up. That's all you can say, the guy ate us up tonight."	Carmona completed the job in 1 hour, 57 minutes -- the second-fastest game in Progressive Field history and fourth fastest in the majors this season.	Minnesota entered the weekend with a six-game lead over Chicago. The White Sox are hosting the Kansas City Royals for three games before the Twins come to Chicago for three next week.	Matt LaPorta homered in the second inning off Carl Pavano (16-11), who allowed just two runs and six hits but lost for the fourth time in five starts. The right-hander has been bothered by a stiff neck, and it was so bad in the morning that he visited a chiropractor.	"Usually I get it the day after a start or between a start," said Pavano, with ice wraps strapped to his shoulder and neck. "It was a battle. I knew I was going to pitch, but I knew I didn't feel good. What are you going to do? You get through it. It's a long year.	"I know I didn't have my best stuff. We got out-pitched for sure," he said.	The Twins came in as the league's hottest team -- and baseball's best since the All-Star break. Minnesota had increased its division lead by three games already this week, but Carmona and the cellar-dwelling Indians cooled them down on a crisp, late-summer night.	Carmona didn't overpower Minnesota's lineup, but he had the Twins guessing and over-swinging at his pitches. He walked one, struck out seven and got inning-ending double plays to end the third and fourth.	The right-hander continued his comeback season after going 5-12 and being sent down to the lowest level of the minor leagues last year.	He worked hard on his conditioning during the offseason and Carmona sharpened his mental game in sessions with Cleveland's psychological staff. He's beginning to look more like the 19-game winner who broke onto the scene in 2007.	"He accomplished it," Acta said, pointing toward Cleveland's clubhouse, where Carmona was getting dressed. "I'm proud of him. He pitched in winter ball, worked on what he had to work on. He bought into everything we were trying to sell to him."	The Twins never put two runners on at the same time in any inning off Carmona and only got one to third when Denard Span tripled after a double play in the third. Orlando Hudson then lined out to third to end Minnesota's best scoring threat.	"He had a great sinker, a great changeup, a great slider," Gardenhire said. "The ball was diving all over the place. The ball was just disappearing."	The Twins were without designated hitter Jim Thome, who sat out for the second straight game with a mild abdominal strain. The former Indians slugger has been on a home run tear and is tied with Frank Robinson for eighth place on the career homers list with 586.	Game notes	 Carmona has pitched in two of the four fastest games this season. He opposed Detroit's Armando Galarraga in the infamous near-perfect game that lasted only 1:44 on June 2. ... Gardenhire expects Thome to be in Saturday's lineup. Among his many career achievements is the longest homer in Progressive Field history. He hit a 511-footer in 1999 off Kansas City's Don Wengert when the ballpark was still called Jacobs Field. ... Hall of Famer Bob Feller, who is being treated for leukemia, watched the game from the 91-year-old's usual press box seat. ... Twins reliever Brian Fuentes underwent an MRI for his sore back on Wednesday. He is scheduled to pitch a bullpen session Saturday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

DETROIT -- Jake Fox was a villain in more ways than one Friday.	Not only did he hit a two-run homer to help the Baltimore Orioles beat the Detroit Tigers 6-3, but the former Michigan Wolverines star also did it on a night when Comerica Park was filled with Michigan State fans.	"It's always fun to play when you have a lot of friends and family in the crowd like I had tonight, but I was also hearing it from all the State fans," Fox said, one day before the Spartans play Florida Atlantic at nearby Ford Field. "They were chanting 'Go State' at me, and I thought about turning around and yelling 'Go Blue,' but I decided that can wait until we play each other in a few weeks."	Fox entered with a perfect 4-for-4 line against Tigers starter Armando Galarraga, including his first career homer, so Baltimore manager Buck Showalter had two reasons to play the light-hitting infielder.	"He's had some success against Galarraga, but this is also his town," Showalter said. "I was waiting for him to do the postgame interview with a Michigan football helmet on."	For Galarraga, most of the attention was focused on his reunion with umpire Jim Joyce. It was the first time they had been involved in the same game since Joyce's missed call with two out in the ninth cost Galarraga a perfect game on June 2.	Joyce, who worked the plate, was applauded by the crowd when he was announced before the game. But that was the only sign anything unusual was happening.	Galarraga allowed three runs and four hits in seven innings. Any hope for another run at perfection ended quickly -- Luke Scott hit a leadoff single in the second for Baltimore.	"I didn't think I was super good, but I wasn't bad, either," he said. "I mainly just made one bad pitch on Fox's home run."	The Orioles broke it open against Detroit's bullpen. Phil Coke (7-5) came in to pitch the eighth and was struck on his right ankle by Ty Wigginton's one-out liner, which went into foul territory near first for an infield hit. Nick Markakis followed with a single to center, and Wigginton took third when Austin Jackson misplayed the ball.	After Markakis took second on a wild pitch, Scott was intentionally walked and Matt Wieters followed with a fly ball to right, giving the Orioles a 4-3 lead. Adam Jones added an RBI single off Robbie Weinhardt.	"I made a key error that was a turning point in the game," said Jackson, normally a top-notch defensive outfielder. "I just tried to get too quick with the ball."	Brian Roberts hit a sacrifice fly in the ninth to make it 6-3 and Koji Uehara got three outs in the bottom half for his eighth save.	Miguel Cabrera hit his 34th homer and drove in three runs for the Tigers, who finished with 10 hits. Jackson went 3-for-5 and scored a run.	Fox connected in the fifth, giving the Orioles a 3-1 lead with a drive over the left-field bullpens. It was his seventh homer of the season and second at Comerica Park.	"I don't know what it is about this place, but I've always seen the ball well here," Fox said.	Cabrera responded with a two-run shot of his own in the bottom half. Wieters missed Johnny Damon's foul popup a few feet away from home plate, and Damon walked before Cabrera's tying shot off Kevin Millwood.	Jackson started the Tigers seventh with a triple, but David Hernandez (6-8) retired the next two batters. Cabrera was intentionally walked for the 30th time this season, and Ryan Raburn struck out to end the inning.	Showalter said walking Cabrera was one of the easiest decisions of his career.	"We were trying to pitch around him, and he still had three RBIs," Showalter said. "And it isn't like he was just having a hot night -- he's done that against everyone he's faced."	Showalter's only problem was that he had trouble getting Wieters' attention to order the walk.	"I kept yelling for him, but the crowd and the announcer were so loud that he couldn't hear me," Showalter said. "After the inning, I told him I had been worried that he wouldn't know I wanted to walk him, and he told me that if I hadn't called for the walk, he was going to do it himself."	Millwood allowed three runs, two earned, and eight hits in six innings.	Game notes	 Cabrera is the first American Leaguer to be intentionally walked 30 times in a season since John Olerud in 1993. ... The Tigers announced before the game that second baseman Carlos Guillen would have exploratory knee surgery on Sept. 17 and will miss the rest of the season. Guillen has been out since injuring his left knee while turning a game-ending double play against the Yankees on Aug. 16. ... Brandon Snyder made his major league debut, playing first base in the ninth inning for the Orioles.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

WASHINGTON -- Nine days after the Florida Marlins and Washington Nationals brawled, they played without turmoil.	In the first meeting of the teams since the Sept. 1 fight, Alex Sanabia allowed three hits in 6 2/3 innings to lead the Marlins over the Nationals 3-1 on Friday night.	Before the game, all was normal. Players visited with each other and Florida manager Edwin Rodriguez and Washington manager Jim Riggleman met at home plate.	In the bottom of the second inning, Nyjer Morgan, who received an eight-game suspension for charging Chris Volstad after the right-hander threw behind him, tried to steal second with two outs and pitcher John Lannan at bat.	Rookie catcher Brad Davis, who would homer in the seventh inning, threw out Morgan. It was the league-leading 17th time Morgan had been caught stealing.	When he was asked what was more satisfying -- hitting a key home run or nabbing Morgan -- Davis didn't have to think long.	"Throwing out Nyjer. It was the wrong time to steal, and I think he kind of did it in spite of us," Davis said. "With all that happened, I think he kind of wants to put it to us a little bit, which is understandable. I would, too."	That was the only hint of trash talk in the wake of the fight that caused Major League Baseball to discipline six players, both managers and a coach.	Riggleman defended Morgan, whose hearing was held earlier Friday. Besides the eight-game suspension, Morgan had also been suspended for seven games for throwing a ball into the stands at Philadelphia on Aug. 21.	"I can't ask him to hit eighth but not run," Riggleman said. "That's Nyjer's game, I can't take that away from him."	Sanabia (4-2), who will start a five-game suspension Saturday, allowed three hits in scoreless 6 2/3 innings.	"Whatever happened at home, happened. That was the end of that," Sanabia said. "There was really no point of starting anything back up."	Before the game, Marlins first baseman Gaby Sanchez dropped his appeal of a three-game suspension, as did Nationals reliever Doug Slaten.	As for the game, Dan Uggla had three hits as Florida stopped (71-69) stopped a three-game losing streak and avoided falling to .500. Washington has lost eight of its last nine to Florida and three in a row overall.	In his first start since turning 22 on Wednesday, Sanabia struck out three, walked three, hit a batter and had a seventh-inning single, his first major league hit after an 0-for-15 start at the plate. Sanabia gave up a second-inning single to Morgan, a fifth-inning double to Michael Morse and a seventh-inning infield hit to Ivan Rodriguez.	Leo Nunez gave up Roger Bernadina's RBI single in the eighth. Clay Hensley got four outs for his first save in 164 major league games.	Lannan (7-7) allowed three runs and seven hits in 6 2/3 innings, striking out six and walking three. The left-hander admitted that he had been under the weather but didn't want to use it as an excuse.	Uggla hit an RBI single in the first, and Wes Helms followed with a sacrifice fly. Davis homered leading off the seventh.	Game notes	 Volstad is scheduled to start Sunday against the Nationals and then serve his six-game suspension beginning Monday. ... Marlins right-hander Josh Johnson rejoined the club after his pitching shoulder and back were examined in Florida. Originally scheduled to pitch Friday, Johnson is to throw in the bullpen this weekend and said wants to pitch again this season. "If it feels better in the next couple of days, why not?" Johnson said. Rodriguez said he'll be cautious with Johnson. "If there's any chance of him getting worse, we're going to shut him down for the rest of the season," Rodriguez said. ... Florida's Logan Morrison has reached base in 30 straight games. ... Hensley had been a teammate of Trevor Hoffman's in San Diego for four years, and he plans to send Hoffman a congratulatory message on his 600th save. "I'm going to shoot him a text and tell him I have 599 to go."	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

TORONTO -- Even with a seven-run lead, Joe Maddon never got too comfortable when the power-packed Toronto Blue Jays came up to bat.	"They're the SWAT team of the American League," the Tampa Bay Rays manager said. "They can strike at any moment."	Toronto rallied from a seven-run deficit to tie the game 8-all, but Rays third baseman Evan Longoria scored the go-ahead run on a throwing error by shortstop Yunel Escobar in the ninth inning as the Rays beat the Blue Jays 9-8 Friday night.	"At this time of the year, if you score one more point than the other team, you'll take it any day of the week," Maddon said.	B.J. Upton and Ben Zobrist hit solo homers as Tampa Bay won for just the second time in six games.	The AL wild-card leaders, Tampa Bay entered 2 1/2 games behind the New York Yankees in the East.	Tampa Bay led 8-1 in the fourth before the Blue Jays rallied. Jose Bautista's second homer of the game, a two-run shot in the seventh, tied it at 8.	"They're a good ballclub," Upton said of the Blue Jays. "In any other division, they're at the top. You can't take anything for granted with these guys."	The Rays won it with an unearned run in the ninth against Toronto closer Kevin Gregg (1-5). After back-to-back walks to Longoria and Carlos Pena, Sean Rodriguez hit a grounder to first. Lyle Overbay forced Pena at second but Escobar's return throw sailed wide, allowing Longoria to score.	"As soon as I hit it I just said 'Beat Kevin Gregg to the bag,'" Rodriguez said. "That was my only thought."	Rodriguez said a hard slide by Pena may have disrupted Escobar's relay attempt.	"He did a good job, he got after Escobar," Rodriguez said of Pena. "That's one of those hustle plays to win the game that might go overlooked."	Joaquin Benoit (1-2) pitched 1 1/3 innings for the win and Rafael Soriano struck out the side in the ninth for his AL-leading 42nd save in 44 chances.	"Soriano was magnificent," Maddon said.	Soriano has converted 19 consecutive save opportunities, matching Roberto Hernandez's club record, set in 1999.	Bautista hit his major league-leading 45th and 46th home runs but Toronto still lost its third straight. It was Bautista's seventh multihomer game of the season and the ninth of his career.	Adam Lind and John Buck also connected for the Blue Jays, who lead the majors with 222 home runs, including an ML-high 126 at home.	The 222 homers is the second most in Blue Jays history, surpassing the 221 by the 1998 team. Toronto hit 244 homers in 2000.	The Rays scored six runs in a bat-around first against Toronto left-hander Brett Cecil, who came in 8-2 with a 2.36 ERA in 11 starts against AL East opponents.	Upton led off with a single but was erased on Jason Bartlett's fielder's choice. Carl Crawford hit an RBI triple and Longoria singled him home before Pena struck out. Rodriguez walked and both he and Longoria scored on Rocco Baldelli's double before Zobrist homered to left, his 10th.	The Blue Jays got one back in the bottom half when Escobar scored on a base hit by Vernon Wells.	The Rays responded with a run in the second. Bartlett doubled, took third on Crawford's infield single and scored on Longoria's single.	Cecil left after issuing a leadoff walk to Baldelli in the third, matching his shortest start of the season. He allowed seven runs and eight hits, walked two and struck out three.	"He's been tough on us in the past because he's been able to locate his pitches and pretty much do what he wants," Upton said. "I didn't really see that from him today."	Upton hit a leadoff homer off reliever Josh Roenicke in the third, his 17th.	Lind hit a two-run drive in the fourth, his 21st, and Bautista added a two-run drive in the fifth, both off Rays right-hander James Shields.	Shields was tagged for six home runs in his previous start against Toronto on Aug. 7 and came in 1/3 with a 5.67 ERA in five career starts at Rogers Centre. The right-hander allowed five runs, four earned, in five innings.	"This team definitely gives him a tough time," Maddon said.	Buck matched his career high by connecting off Choate to begin the seventh, his 18th.	Choate left after a one-out walk to Dewayne Wise, with Chad Qualls coming on to retire Escobar before leaving for Benoit.	Bautista took exception to a called first strike after being denied time by plate umpire Chad Fairchild. He stepped out of the box to complain, then swatted Benoit's next pitch over the wall in left-center for a tying home run.	"I just wanted a reason why he didn't give me time after I requested it," Bautista said. "I'm just glad I kept my cool and was able to focus and put a good swing on the next pitch."	The crowd of 14,305 called Bautista out of the dugout for a curtain call after he circled the bases. He has gone deep 30 times at home this season, matching Carlos Delgado's club record, set in 2000.	Game notes	 The Blue Jays recalled LHP Brad Mills from Triple-A Las Vegas. RHP Taylor Buchholz, claimed on waivers from Colorado on Thursday, also joined the team. ... Tampa Bay sent minor league RHP Matt Gorgen to Arizona to complete the July 31 trade for Qualls.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

NEW YORK -- Shane Victorino scanned the lineup card posted in the Philadelphia clubhouse, checking out who was playing for the New York Mets.	"Sorry, fellas, you all aren't going to be the spoilers," the center fielder said several hours before gametime.	Nope, not with Roy Halladay pitching for the Phillies.	Halladay earned his 18th victory, the most by a Philadelphia pitcher in 27 years, and helped himself with a two-run single that sent the Phillies past the Mets 8-4 Friday night for their fourth win in a row.	"I told him, 'We won't talk about your pitching tonight, we'll talk about your hitting,'" Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said.	Ryan Howard and Chase Utley homered as the NL East leaders held their one-game edge over Atlanta. Wilson Valdez, subbing for injured shortstop Jimmy Rollins, drove in two runs and scored once.	In his first season with the two-time NL champions, Halladay is new to the pennant race. He's never reached the playoffs.	"You look forward to coming to the field every day. You're not packing boxes," he said. "It's a lot of fun."	Halladay (18-10) became the Phillies' top winner since John Denny posted 19 during his Cy Young season in 1983. A strange stat, considering Philadelphia's success of late. In fact, every other franchise in the majors except Tampa Bay -- with David Price currently at 17 -- had a pitcher win at least 18 over that span.	Halladay tied Colorado's Ubaldo Jimenez and St. Louis' Adam Wainwright for the NL victory lead. He took over the league lead in strikeouts, fanning Luis Castillo for his 200th victim.	It was hardly vintage Halladay, as he allowed four runs and eight hits in 7 2/3 innings.	Halladay needed a mound meeting with catcher Carlos Ruiz after throwing only one pitch and again got bit by the home run bug. He nicked the No. 8 batter with a pitch and saw the opposing pitcher line a sharp single for his first career hit.	"There were times I was mechanically out of sorts," he said.	Still, Halladay improved to 4-0 against the Mets this year. This marked his 53rd consecutive road start of going at least six innings, the longest such streak in the majors since Walter Johnson went 82 straight in 1911-15. Halladay tops the majors with 228 2/3 innings this season.	"That's why he's one of the best, if not the best in the game. Because he can pitch well without his best stuff," said Mets star David Wright, hitless in three tries against Halladay and 2 for 15 with eight strikeouts versus him overall. "I thought he had good stuff. But he's a bulldog out there."	Carlos Beltran homered and Josh Thole singled three times off Halladay, making the Mets rookie catcher 6 for 9 lifetime against the Phillies ace. Jose Reyes returned after missing two weeks with a strained right oblique and delivered an RBI double.	"You get a different pattern every time you face him. But you know he's going to throw strikes. I try to hit early in the count because I don't want to get to his really nasty stuff," Thole said.	Mets rookie pitcher Jenrry Mejia was more effective with his bat and legs than arm. He singled in the third for his first hit, then raced around the bases and belly-flopped home on a double by Reyes.	Beltran homered a batter later for a 3-2 lead. In Halladay's previous start, he yielded a career-high four homers against Milwaukee.	Mejia (0-4) remained winless as a big leaguer.	Howard launched an opposite-field shot that cleared the high wall in left for his 29th home run, the solo shot making it 3-all in the fourth.	The Phillies loaded the bases with two outs later in the inning and, with Halladay due up, Mets pitching coach Dan Warthen and all the New York infielders went to the mound. Halladay, a career .120 hitter with four RBIs lifetime at that point, chopped the next pitch over Mejia's head for a go-ahead single.	"A lot of luck," Halladay said.	Game notes	 Rollins was out because of tightness in his right hamstring. He may miss a couple of games. ... RHP Kyle Kendrick will start for Philadelphia on Saturday. He's been struggling and the Phillies considered using rookie Vance Worley. ... The Mets honored former C Ed Hearn and his foundation. He's had three kidney transplants since 1991. A member of the 1986 World Series champs, he threw out the ceremonial first ball and winged it to the backstop.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ATLANTA -- The Atlanta Braves are still in second place but feeling a whole lot better after rallying against Chris Carpenter and the St. Louis Cardinals.	Atlanta scored six runs in the sixth inning, sending 10 hitters to the plate and taking advantage of a dropped fly ball by right fielder Jon Jay to rally for a much-needed 8-6 victory Friday night.	"That was huge," said Brooks Conrad, who sparked the big inning with a pinch-hit single. "Every one from here on out is huge. Now we're looking to string a few together."	The Braves appeared headed for their seventh loss in nine games when they fell behind 4-1 in the fourth. They gave up a two-run homer to Matt Holliday and a two more RBIs to Carpenter, who began the night hitting .098 but had a run-scoring single and the second homer of his career batting in the eighth spot.	Carpenter (15-6) couldn't back up his good work at the plate. The Braves closed to 4-2 in the fourth on Brian McCann's run-scoring single and then knocked out the St. Louis starter in the sixth.	Atlanta remained one game behind the NL East-leading Philadelphia Phillies, which beat the New York Mets 8-4. St. Louis fell to six games behind the Cincinnati Reds, who beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-3 in 12 innings, in the NL Central.	"It was a great comeback against a great pitcher," Braves manager Bobby Cox said. "We've just been on this little losing streak, and we needed to snap it."	Conrad got it started with the first of four straight hits off Carpenter. Jason Heyward yanked an RBI single to right and Martin Prado doubled to tie the game at 4.	McCann followed with a deep fly ball to right that would've brought in a run, since Heyward was tagging, but wound up driving in both runners when Jay dropped the ball just short of the wall. McCann rumbled all the way to third and trotted home on Derrek Lee's run-scoring single.	"He's a good outfielder," St. Louis manager Tony La Russa said of Jay. "He [usually] makes that play. That's baseball. A six-spot is tough to accept. It should have been a three-spot."	That wasn't the only break for the Braves. Conrad appeared to be picked off at second on a throw from catcher Yadier Molina, but umpire Bill Welke called the runner safe. Even Conrad looked a bit surprised by the call, the tag appearing to get him on the right shoulder just before he scrambled back to the bag.	Carpenter was lifted after Lee's hit, having failed to get an out in the sixth. He was charged with six earned runs and eight hits. Melky Cabrera added a sacrifice fly before Conrad, batting for the second time, hit a flyout that finally ended the inning.	St. Louis scored a pair of runs off Jonny Venters in the seventh, but Takashi Saito and Billy Wagner closed out the Cardinals, with Wagner earning his 33rd save in 40 chances. Atlanta won its major league-leading 50th home game.	Peter Moylan (6-2) won with a scoreless sixth after taking over for starter Mike Minor, who surrendered four runs and seven hits in five-plus innings.	Carpenter allowed more than three earned runs for the first time since July 3, a span of 12 starts.	"I felt good. My stuff was good," he said. "It was bad timing to have an inning like that."	La Russa's unorthodox lineup, revived for the series in Atlanta in hopes of sparking his slumping team, appeared to backfire when Carpenter, batting just .098 (6-for-61), came up in the second with two outs and two runners aboard.	Not so fast. Carpenter lined a single to left to put the Cardinals ahead.	After the Braves tied it on Nate McLouth's long homer in the bottom half, Holliday hit a drive over the center-field wall for his 26th homer.	Then it was Carpenter's turn to go deep. Minor left a fastball out over the plate and his counterpart, swinging late but making good contact, sent a drive to right that just cleared the wall over a leaping Heyward. Carpenter made an extremely slow trot around the bases, thoroughly savoring the moment.	It didn't last.	Game notes	Right-hander Jake Westbrook will have an extra mouth to feed when he starts Saturday for the Cardinals. His wife, Heather, delivered the couple's third child on Thursday, a girl named Harper. ... Braves hitting coach Terry Pendleton was ejected by first-base umpire Jim Reynolds in the third inning for arguing over a checked swing by Albert Pujols. Reynolds ruled that Pujols didn't go around, Pendleton began shouting from the dugout and the umpire quickly gave him the heave. The ump even waved at Pendleton and mouthed, "Bye, bye." ... Outfielder Skip Schumaker didn't start for St. Louis despite hitting a homer in the series opener. Russa didn't want to use the left-handed hitter against the Braves' lefty starter. Schumaker will be in the lineup for the final two games of the series against right-handers Tommy Hanson and Tim Hudson.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- Two aggressive first-pitch swings by Nelson Cruz gave the Texas Rangers a stirring victory.	Cruz led off the 13th inning with a home run after connecting in the eighth to tie it as the Rangers beat the New York Yankees 6-5 on Friday night.	Cruz ripped the first pitch from Chad Gaudin (0-4) into the Rangers' bullpen to give Texas its second win over the Yankees in six games this season.	"I was just looking for something to drive in that situation," said Cruz, soaked from a beer shower by teammates following his third game-winning homer of the season. "I was just trying to be aggressive."	Cruz tied it at 5 when he led off the eighth with a towering first-pitch homer to left off Joba Chamberlain.	"It's not like he's knocking guys in from second, he's hitting solo homers, which isn't easy to do," Texas' Michael Young said.	It's been an up-and-down season for Cruz, who's trying to stay healthy after three stints on the disabled list due to hamstring strains. Despite all the missed time, he has 19 homers and 70 RBIs.	The teams combined to use an American League-record 19 pitchers, one shy of the major league mark set by the Chicago Cubs and Colorado Rockies on Sept. 30, 2006.	The game, which lasted 5 hours, 12 minutes before a near-sellout crowd, was a possible playoff preview.	"We stood up there tonight, went toe-to-toe with those guys and got the win," Rangers manager Ron Washington said. "It was important for those guys in that clubhouse to know we're capable, especially after we were down 4-1."	Scott Feldman (7-10), the 11th Texas pitcher to tie a major league record, worked the 13th for the decision.	Texas maintained its 7½-game lead over Oakland in the AL West. The A's beat Boston 5-0.	The Yankees' lead over Tampa Bay in the AL East slipped to 1½ games. The Rays beat Toronto 9-8.	New York, which stranded 18 runners, loaded the bases with two outs in the 13th, but Chad Moeller flied to center. The Yankees had a runner on third with one out in the 12th after Moeller doubled into the right-field corner and advanced on Brett Gardner's sacrifice bunt.	But Derek Jeter, who was 1-for-7, was retired on a weak groundout, and Colin Curtis struck out swinging.	"We left a lot of guys on base," Jeter said. "Good teams find a way to get those runs in."	There were plenty of regrets in the Yankees clubhouse, including Chamberlain, whose slider over the heart of the plate led to Cruz's tying homer in the eighth.	"It wasn't a good pitch. ... It's not like he [Cruz] snuck up on us," Chamberlain said. "He can beat you in a lot of ways. Their pitchers did their jobs. The sun will come up tomorrow and we'll have another opportunity to do our job."	Alex Rodriguez's two-run double keyed a four-run third for the Yankees, who'd won nine of their previous 12.	No. 9 hitter Julio Borbon had a career-high four RBIs for the Rangers.	Yankees starter Javier Vazquez allowed four runs and six hits in five-plus innings.	The Rangers appeared to get a break in the second when Ian Kinsler attempted a steal of second base.	Francisco Cervelli's throw beat Kinsler, and replays showed Jeter tagging Kinsler on the wrist. Second base umpire Alfonso Marquez called Kinsler safe, prompting an argument from Yankees manager Joe Girardi.	Kinsler later scored from third on Borbon's groundout to put Texas in front.	The Yankees struck back against C.J. Wilson in the third on Rodriguez's two-run double, and RBI singles from Marcus Thames and Cervelli.	Rodriguez had been 0-for-12 against Wilson, the most hitless at-bats against any pitcher in Rodriguez's 17-year career.	Wilson allowed four runs and six hits in three innings, his shortest outing of the season.	Game notes	 The only other club to use 11 pitchers in a game was Seattle on Sept. 25, 1992 against Texas. ... Rangers SS Elvis Andrus returned after missing five games with a tight right hamstring. ... Texas OF Josh Hamilton, who leads the majors with a .361 batting average, was out for a sixth consecutive game due to a bruised right ribcage. ... Yankees C Jorge Posada did not catch for the second straight game because of post-concussion symptoms. But he pinch-hit in the 13th. Posada said he was ready to go back behind the plate, but Girardi is being cautious, saying Posada won't catch again until at least Sunday. Posada was struck in the mask with a foul tip Tuesday night against Baltimore. ... Girardi said LHP Andy Pettitte will make one more rehab start before rejoining the rotation. Pettitte has been on the 15-day DL since July 20 with a strained left groin. ... Reggie Jackson visited the Yankees' clubhouse before the game and watched some of the game from the owner's box with Rangers president Nolan Ryan. ... Kinsler was ejected in the 10th by home plate umpire Dale Scott for protesting a called third strike.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

HOUSTON -- Jay Gibbons' performance since he returned to the majors has manager Joe Torre wishing he would have brought him up sooner.	Gibbons hit a two-run homer in the 11th inning and the Los Angeles Dodgers stopped a six-game slide with a 4-2 win over the Houston Astros on Friday night.	Gibbons is batting .343 with four homers and 12 RBIs in 35 at-bats since he was promoted from Triple-A Albuquerque on Aug. 8. It's his first stint in the majors since 2007, but Torre believes he could be an everyday player.	"I think he certainly would hold his own," Torre said. "He can do a couple of things, play first base, play the outfield. When he stands at the plate he knows what he wants to do. I don't think there's any question that he has a plan when he's up there."	Matt Kemp singled before Gibbons connected against Fernando Abad (0-1), hitting a drive over the wall in right-center. Gibbons also had a pinch-hit RBI single in the sixth that gave Los Angeles a 2-1 lead.	"Anytime you can help the team is good, but coming off the bench is the role they have for me and I'll definitely take it and I love it," Gibbons said. "I'm just trying to get more at-bats."	Octavio Dotel (3-3) struck out three in two scoreless innings for the win. Humberto Quintero singled with two outs, but Dotel struck out Angel Sanchez to end the game.	"The thing is when you're not winning ballgames, something bad happens you kind of shake your head," Torre said. "I was just glad that we pitched the way we did at the end."	Michael Bourn had three hits and two RBIs for Houston, which had won three straight. Rookie Brett Wallace went 2 for 3.	Bourn singled in a run in the seventh, tying it at 2, but was caught in a rundown to end the inning. Wallace set up the run with a one-out double off Ronald Belisario that rolled up the hill in center field before bouncing off the wall.	Bourn also tripled with one out in the 10th before Dotel struck out Jeff Keppinger and Hunter Pence to end the inning.	"We got some big hits tonight, we just didn't capitalize on the other ones," Houston manager Brad Mills said.	Kemp tripled and scored when Gibbons delivered in the sixth. Kemp briefly considered breaking for home after a bad throw to third on his hit, but the Astros chased the ball down quickly and he returned to the bag.	Hiroki Kuroda pitched six innings for the Dodgers, yielding just one run and four hits. He struck out three and walked two.	"We faced a tough pitcher in Kuroda and they have a pretty good pen ... at the back end," Bourn said. "They're not easy to score runs against."	Bourn's two-out single tied it at 1 in the fifth. After Keppinger walked, Pence grounded out to leave the bases loaded.	That rally came after the Dodgers grabbed the lead in the top half of the inning against J.A. Happ. Rod Barajas reached on a leadoff single and advanced on Kuroda's sacrifice. Jamey Carroll singled him in with two out.	Happ allowed seven hits in five innings.	Game notes	 Houston RHP Henry Villar made his major league debut in the 11th inning. He committed an error before striking out Carroll. ... The Astros are waiting to see what the next step will be for RHP Felipe Paulino, who is on the 60-day disabled list with a right rotator cuff injury. He threw a simulated game Thursday and said Friday he hopes he'll be able to pitch again before the season is over. ... Dodgers C Brad Ausmus will start on Sunday against the Astros. Los Angeles manager Joe Torre said he thought it would be nice for 41-year-old Ausmus to play against the team where he spent the majority of his career.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

MILWAUKEE -- Carlos Zambrano has put his midseason troubles behind him and is back to being a dominant pitcher.	Zambrano pitched three-hit ball into the ninth inning Friday night, winning his fifth consecutive decision since returning to the starting rotation after being suspended in June following a dugout spat and leading the Chicago Cubs to a 4-0 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers.	"Everything was working today and I am very happy with the way I pitched," Zambrano said. "	Zambrano gave up just three singles in 8 2/3 innings, had three hits of his own and drove in a run. He tied a season high with nine strikeouts and walked three, giving him 32 strikeouts and 10 walks in his last four starts.	Zambrano even reacted calmly when he was removed from the game in the ninth inning after an error by shortstop Starlin Castro robbed him of a complete game. He had retired 13 straight batters until Ryan Braun lined a single to left field with two outs in the ninth.	Prince Fielder followed with a groundball that Castro botched for an error. Closer Carlos Marmol was brought in and got Casey McGehee to fly out to right field on his first pitch to end the game. It was Marmol's's 29th save in 34 chances.	"Sometimes I get frustrated when someone commits an error," Zambrano said. "But at the end of the day, you realize we're all human and we all make mistakes. He [Castro] tried his best but just couldn't make the play. We won the game and that's what is important."	Cubs interim manager Mike Quade said Zambrano's performance was "vintage."	"Of all the good starts he has made recently, that was the best," Quade said. "He had the whole package tonight. He was really good."	Quade said Zambrano is a different pitcher since he returned, both from a pitching and mental standpoint.	"I know he pitches with passion and emotions and that's OK, but he's been as calm and as good as I've seen him," he said. "I've enjoyed watching hiim for a lot of years, but this stretch has been something special."	Brewers manager Ken Macha said his team's best chance to get to Zambrano came in the second inning when he walked the first two hitters. But Zambrano grabbed a liner from Chris Dickerson and then got an inning-ending double play.	"Zambrano has been throwing the ball well and he did that again tonight," Macha said.	Dave Bush (7-12) pitched 5 2/3 innings, giving up three runs and five hits for the Brewers.	Bush said he tried to match Zambrano, but four walks did him in.	"It was one those days for us," he said. "[The walks] were a lot of guys for me to put on base. That hurt me the most."	The Cubs grabbed a 2-0 lead in the second inning. After Darwin Barney and Zambrano singled, Kosuke Fukudome hit a grounder to Brewers second baseman Rickie Weeks, whose throw to second was wide, allowing Barney to score. Castro hit a sacrifice fly to score Zambrano.	Zambrano helped himself in the fifth inning. After Blake DeWitt walked and Barney singled, Zambrano lined a single to center to score DeWitt and increase the Cubs lead to 3-0.	Barney scored on a throwing error in the eighth inning after Zambrano beat out a grounder for his third hit to give the Cubs a 4-0 lead.	Game notes	 Brewers vice president of communications Tyler Barnes said the team was investigating who put a fake press release critical of Cubs general manager Jim Hendry in the press box before the game. ... Cubs third baseman Aramis Ramirez missed his fourth straight game with a sore right quad. He is day to day. ... Prior to the game, the Brewers recalled right-hander Mark Rogers from Double-A Huntsville. The 2004 draft pick made his major league debut pitching a scoreless ninth inning.

DENVER -- Troy Tulowitzki's stunning power surge could be all in the wrists.	Tulowitzki homered twice -- he has eight in his past eight games -- and Jorge De La Rosa struck out a season-high 10 in six innings to lead the Colorado Rockies past the Arizona Diamondbacks 13-4 on Friday night for their season-best eighth consecutive victory.	Tulowitzki doubled and walked in going 3-for-3 with four runs scored, matching a career best. He is batting .444 in his past eight games -- during which he has had two of his three career multihomer games -- and has reached 20 homers in a season for the third time in his career.	The latest power display coincides with a return to normalcy in the left wrist that he fractured when hit by a pitch June 17. He missed 33 games before returning July 27.	"I think he's physically beginning to feel better and better every day as far as that wrist is concerned," manager Jim Tracy said. "Because that bat is going through the zone again in a hurry."	Tulowitzki agreed his wrist is the best it has been since coming back from the fracture.	"I've definitely felt better as of late," he said. "In batting practice, I can tell my power is starting to come back. Sometimes, you get hurt and you've got to play with it and realize what you can and can't do. Before I felt like the power wasn't there, so I was more spraying the ball around. Now, I feel like I can pick my chances to try to take a swing where I can hit a home run."	Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson said Tulowitzki made it tough on his club.	"He's hot,"Gibson said. "He's seeing the ball real well. We got around [Carlos] Gonzalez well tonight. That's one of the strengths of their team, if you get around the first guy, you got to get around the second guy. We tip our hat to him. We'll have to make better pitches at him tomorrow."	Tulowitzki's barrage backed De La Rosa (7-4), who struck out the side in the fourth inning and fanned at least one batter in each of the innings he pitched in winning his third consecutive decision.	He allowed two runs and five hits, including Chris Young's 25th homer in the second. But De La Rosa also hit an RBI double in a six-run third inning to help the Rockies stay close in the NL West race and the NL wild-card chase.	The Rockies capitalized on an erratic outing by Joe Saunders (2-5), who gave up seven runs and five hits in 2 1/3 innings, his shortest outing of the season. He struck out one and walked four, the last with the bases loaded, in dropping a September start for the first time in his past 12 outings in the month dating to 2007.	Colorado broke the game open in the third, with Tuolowitzki doubling to right to drive in the first of the Rockies' six runs in the inning. Saunders walked the next three batters, leaving in favor of D.J. Carrasco after forcing in a run with his final walk. Miguel Olivo greeted Carrasco with a bases-clearing triple and De La Rosa doubled over the head of left fielder Rusty Ryal to drive in the inning's sixth run for 8-1 lead.	The Diamondbacks added a run in the fourth on pinch-hitter Cole Gillespie's groundout but Tulowitzki answered in the bottom of the fourth with a drive off Carrasco that sailed 15 rows into the left-field bleachers.	Eric Young Jr. and Ryan Spilborghs had RBI singles around Tulowitzki's second homer in the sixth inning, off reliever Zach Kroenke, who was making his major league debut.	Game notes	 Olivo's triple in the third was his career-best sixth of the season. He had five last year. ... It was the fifth time in his career De La Rosa has had 10 or more strikeouts in a game. His career high is 12. ... Saunders had allowed only four runs in 15 innings over his two previous starts. ... Todd Helton's double in the sixth was the 525th of his career, tying him with Ted Williams for 35th on the all-time list. ... Rockies reliever Edgmer Escalona pitched a scoreless eighth in his major league debut. ... The Diamondbacks are 11-8 in their past 19 games against NL West teams.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Most of the Fireworks Night crowd of 44,203 had long departed Angel Stadium by the time it was announced at the end of the 13th inning that the pyrotechnics would be postponed until Saturday. Bobby Abreu then unleashed some of his own.	Abreu homered in the 14th to lift Los Angeles to a 4-3 win over the Seattle Mariners on Friday night, following up on Wednesday's 16-inning victory over the Cleveland Indians.	The 30 innings in consecutive games tied an Angels franchise record, matching the mark set April 13-14, 1982, when they beat the Mariners 4-3 in 20 and 2-1 in 10 at Anaheim to begin a seven-game winning streak.	"It was a long game and we all wanted to end it and go home. But we also wanted to win it," Abreu said after closer Fernando Rodney blew a 3-1 lead in the ninth for Jered Weaver. "We deserved to get a win, especially with the way Weave pitched tonight."	Working his second inning of relief, Brian Sweeney (1-2) retired his first batter in the 14th before Abreu drove the right-hander's first-pitch fastball to left-center for his 18th homer. It was the ninth walkoff win for the Angels this season and the 11th loss for the Mariners in that fashion.	Rich Thompson (1-0), one of three consecutive Angels relievers trying to nail down their first major league victory, got the job done with two perfect innings after Jordan Walden and Michael Kohn each worked one inning.	"It was good to get Weaver out of the game and tie the ballgame up in the ninth against Rodney," Seattle DH Russell Branyan said. "But the other guys who came out of their bullpen were tough. There were some guys I'd never seen before. I wish we could have had a better crack at them and done something with them."	Jose Lopez and former Angels first baseman Casey Kotchman hit consecutive one-out RBI doubles in the ninth off Rodney. It was the fifth blown save opportunity in 13 chances this season for the right-hander, who inherited the closer's job after lefty Brian Fuentes was traded to Minnesota on Aug. 27.	In Wednesday's marathon win, Rodney gave up a tying RBI single to pinch-hitter Jayson Nix in the ninth before the Angels won it on Jeff Mathis' sacrifice fly.	Former Angels third baseman Chone Figgins, who shifted to second after signing a $36 million, four-year contract with Seattle in the offseason, made a spectacular play in the 10th to keep the game going.	Mike Napoli hit a grounder up the middle with runners at first and second, but Figgins backhanded the ball behind the bag and made a no-look backhanded flip with his glove to shortstop Josh Wilson, who completed the inning-ending double play.	Angels pinch-hitter Juan Rivera grounded into another inning-ending double play in the 12th with runners at first and second.	Weaver allowed an unearned run and five hits while lowering his ERA to 3.02, but remained winless in six starts since beating Detroit on Aug. 6.	"I've been saying for the last five weeks that I'm in a position where I can only do what I can do," said Weaver, who was in the trainer's room icing his arm when he saw the lead evaporate. "I go out there and pitch and try to keep us in the game. I was able to do that tonight, and we just weren't able to hang onto the lead. But the guys battled back and a big homer by Bobby helped us out."	Weaver struck out six to raise his career-high total to 211 and regain the major league lead from Seattle's Felix Hernandez, who starts Saturday night against Ervin Santana.	"I've said all along that he's got great deception, he mixes his pitches and he's smart with what he's doing out there," Branyan said. "I haven't had a whole lot of luck against him. Tonight he was really getting me out of rhythm. He's been doing it against us all year long. So he obviously has a plan and he's sticking to it."	David Pauley gave up three runs and five hits over 6 2/3 innings for Seattle in his 16th big league start. This was the first time in Pauley's last four starts that his teammates scored a run while he was in the game.	But the 27-year-old rookie has nothing on Weaver, whose teammates managed only one run over his previous four outings -- an eighth-inning solo homer by Torii Hunter last Saturday at Oakland. The Angels had totaled only 26 runs in Weaver's previous 14 starts after beating the Cubs 12-0 at Wrigley Field on June 19.	Seattle's Ichiro Suzuki extended his hitting streak to 11 games with a bunt single in the third and continued to second on catcher Mathis' throwing error. It was Suzuki's 2,214th big league hit, tying Joe DiMaggio for 167th place on the career list.	Suzuki took over the AL lead in hits by one over Texas Rangers outfielder Josh Hamilton. The Japanese star has led the majors in hits six times during his nine previous big league seasons and each of the past four.	The Angels took a 2-0 lead in the fourth on Howie Kendrick's sacrifice fly and an RBI single by Mathis. Seattle got one of the runs back in the fifth when Kotchman singled, took third on Michael Saunders' single and continued home as Hunter's one-hop throw from right field skipped past third baseman Alberto Callaspo.	The error was only the fourth by Hunter in his last 407 games in the outfield, and the second for the nine-time Gold Glove winner since shifting from center field to right when Peter Bourjos was promoted from the minors on Aug. 3.	Mathis, who fouled out on a squeeze attempt Wednesday night before getting his game-ending sac fly, laid down a perfect bunt in the sixth as Erick Aybar scooted home with the Angels' third run.	Game notes	 Weaver has left with the lead in five of his eight no-decisions. ... Hunter's error, which followed two by Mathis, increased the Angels' season total to 100. ... The Mariners' offense reached the 1,000-strikeout mark for the third straight season and 11th time in the franchise's 34-year history when Weaver fanned Adam Moore in the seventh inning.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- Trevor Cahill knew that if anyone had the athleticism and leaping ability to snare a ball headed over the fence, it was Coco Crisp.	Crisp made the play all right, ranking his catch to start the game right up there with the best of his career.	"I didn't know how to react when I caught that, one of the best home runs I've robbed," Crisp said of Ryan Kalish's long leadoff fly. "I wanted to jump up and down and start break-dancing."	Helped by Crisp's grab, Cahill pitched seven innings to become Oakland's first 16-game winner in four years and the Athletics beat the Boston Red Sox 5-0 on Friday night.	Kurt Suzuki hit a two-run double in the first and Daric Barton added a two-run single in the second as the A's knocked Clay Buchholz (15-7) out after only an inning-plus, his second-shortest outing as a starter and shortest in a noninjury situation.	"Not a good night to throw one-plus out there when the team's trying to battle and stay in a position where we can catch up with the guys ahead of us," Buchholz said. "Just a poor effort on my part."	Cahill (16-6), who began the year in the minors, became the first A's pitcher to reach 16 wins since Joe Blanton and Barry Zito in 2006. The only other pitcher in Oakland history to win more games without getting a victory in April was Vida Blue, who posted 17 wins in 1974.	At 22 and a second-year big leaguer, Cahill already is being mentioned in the AL Cy Young Award conversation.	"I just try to go out every time and give the team a chance to win," he said. "I don't think anyone in this clubhouse has thrown up the flag. We still think we're in it."	The A's trail first-place Texas by 7½ games with 22 to go.	This one hardly lived up to the billing of a pitchers' duel featuring 15-game winners and All-Star right-handers.	Buchholz entered with a 2.25 ERA, to 2.72 for Cahill -- Nos. 1 and 3 in the AL, respectively. Buchholz's went up to 2.53, while Cahill lowered his to 2.61.	The A's jumped on Buchholz in a hurry, starting with Crisp's leadoff single in the first. Barton walked and Suzuki followed with his double.	"He never was able to establish any sort of rhythm," Red Sox manager Terry Francona said. "He just looked uncomfortable."	Barton's big hit chased Buchholz after 39 pitches. His only shorter outing came in a one-inning stint at San Francisco on June 26. He left that one with a hyperextended left knee that he hurt running the bases.	Buchholz is winless in his past three outings following a four-start winning streak. This time, he was working on an extra day of rest.	"I felt like I've been off for seven days now," he said. "I didn't really feel comfortable in the bullpen. I tried to throw it 70 percent there, trying to stay in control. I tried to make pitches better than what I needed to make them, and when I missed they hit them."	Even A's manager Bob Geren thought Kalish probably had a home run to open the game. Crisp went over the center-field wall to make the spectacular play.	"He's just a really dynamic player. He can do everything," Geren said.	Crisp also hit three singles against his former team and matched his career high with three stolen bases. He last stole three bags in a game on June 20, 2004, at Atlanta while with Cleveland.	This marks Boston's third trip to the Bay Area of the season -- including one other visit to the Coliseum in July and a stop across the bay in San Francisco to play the Giants in June.	Cahill won for the fourth time in five starts, beating Boston for the first time in three career tries. He didn't allow an earned run for the sixth time in his past nine.	After a walk to No. 9 hitter Lars Anderson in the third, Cahill retired 10 of the next 11 batters. He allowed three hits, struck out four and walked two.	Oakland's visiting clubhouse staff brought in extra lockers typically used by the NFL's Oakland Raiders in order to handle all the additional Red Sox. Their roster is at 34 after pitcher Matt Fox joined the team Friday. He was claimed off waivers from Minnesota on Thursday.	Craig Breslow and Henry Rodriguez each pitched an inning to complete the three-hitter.	Jeremy Hermida, who began the season with Boston before being released by the Red Sox on Aug. 31 and picked up by the A's, went 0-for-3 with a walk against his old team.	Game notes	 The A's lead the season series 4-3. ... Red Sox LHP reliever Felix Doubront stayed back in Boston to undergo further tests on a strained muscle beneath his left collarbone. He isn't likely to rejoin the team until after its West Coast swing that also takes the Red Sox through Seattle. "We're just trying to be conscientious," Francona said. "They'll probably send him to one more doctor, a neurologist." ... Boston SS Marco Scutaro had the night off. ... A's SS Kevin Kouzmanoff missed his fourth straight game and was still listed as day to day after experiencing lower back spasms Sunday at New York. ... Oakland LHP Josh Outman threw a bullpen session and RHP Joey Devine, who like Outman is coming back from Tommy John reconstructive elbow surgery, played catch on flat ground. ... Hall of Famer Rickey Henderson spent some of the game in the A's dugout, giving Crisp a high-five at one point.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

SAN DIEGO -- The San Diego Padres' lead in the NL West is all but gone.	San Francisco pulled into a virtual tie with San Diego atop the NL West with a 1-0 victory Friday night when Aubrey Huff hustled his way to the game's only run in the seventh inning.	The Padres (79-61) hold the slimmest possible lead over the Giants (80-62), .564-.563. San Francisco has won nine of 12 while the Padres have lost 12 of 15. The Padres' recent 10-game losing streak trimmed 5 1/2 games off their lead, which was 6 1/2 games on Aug. 25. They rebounded with a three-game sweep of the Los Angeles Dodgers but have lost the first two of this four-game series against the Giants.	"Awesome," said Huff, who scored despite what he called a "dumb play" on his part. "That's what we play all year for, the grind, all the stuff you go through all year long. It's what you wait for, to be within striking distance at the end of the year. That's where we are. We've got a lot of ball left, though. We haven't won anything yet."	Said Padres shortstop Miguel Tejada: "Now we are tied and it's a 22-game season."	The Colorado Rockies are just 2 1/2 back after winning their eighth straight, 13-4 against Arizona.	It was the 14th straight game in which the Padres were held to four or fewer runs.	"That's tough," losing pitcher Clayton Richard said. "We are fortunate to be where we are at right now with the way we have played the past three weeks. You have to look at it that we are still in first and we have played pretty poorly in the past three weeks."	Lefty Jonathan Sanchez and five relievers combined on a three-hitter. Brian Wilson finished for a five-out save, his career-high 42nd in 46 chances. He's tied with Tampa Bay's Rafael Soriano for the major league lead.	Tejada's decision to try to throw out Huff at third base instead of going for the out at first on Jose Guillen's grounder led to the Giants' seventh-inning run.	Huff was hit in the right elbow by a pitch from Richard leading off the inning and stole second as Pat Burrell struck out. Huff took off for third on Guillen's grounder. Tejada glanced at first before throwing to third, but Huff slid in before Chase Headley could tag him. Huff then scored as pinch-runner Nate Schierholtz was forced on Juan Uribe's grounder to third.	"It was actually a dumb play on my part," Huff said. "The way he hit it, from the angle I was at, it looked like it was going to go in the hole anyway. I thought he hit it a lot harder than he did. Once you go, you've got to at least try to get it. It was a good call. I was safe. But it's not really the way you'd draw it up. It's not a smart play, but it worked out."	Tejada was surprised Huff ran.	"In that situation, when somebody is at second, you never go to third on that ball," Tejada said. "In that situation it's a long throw to go to first. I made the decision to go to third. At that time, I think that's the best play. It is bad baserunning for him. He just got lucky. It was good hustle, too."	Santiago Casilla (7-2) pitched 1 1/3 innings for the win.	Sanchez was gone after five scoreless innings, having given up just one hit but walking a season-high seven. He struck out four.	It was Sanchez's first start against San Diego since a 3-2 loss to the Padres at San Francisco on Aug. 13. A few days before that start, Sanchez guaranteed that the Giants would sweep that series, but the Padres took two of three. Sanchez no-hit the Padres in 2009.	Richard (12-7) allowed one run and two hits in six-plus innings, struck out three and walked one.	The Giants had the bases loaded and one out in the ninth when Wilson hit a comebacker to Ryan Webb. Webb threw home to force Uribe, who grabbed catcher Nick Hundley's right calf, causing him to twist and drop the ball as he went to throw to first. Umpire Chris Guccione immediately called Wilson out due to Uribe's interference.	The Padres failed to take advantage of eight walks.	"We're going to come out of it with a vengeance at some point," manager Bud Black said of the Padres' offensive slump. "I think we have too good of hitters on this team to stay in this too much longer."	Game notes	 Wilson's previous career high in saves was 41 in 2008. ... Wilson has nine saves in 10 opportunities this season when pitching more than 1 1/3 innings. ... Saturday's pitching matchup is San Francisco lefty Madison Bumgarner (5-4) versus Tim Stauffer (3-3), while Sunday's series finale will have a marquee matchup between two-time Cy Young Award winner Tim Lincecum (13-9) and Padres ace Mat Latos (14-5), whose 2.21 ERA is the best in the big leagues. On Tuesday night, Latos set a big league record with his 15th straight start of five or more innings with two or fewer runs allowed. He had been tied with Greg Maddux (1993-94) and Mike Scott (1986) with 14.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

WASHINGTON -- Anibal Sanchez says the opponent doesn't matter.	Still, the right-hander allowed four hits in 7 2/3 innings to lead the Florida Marlins over Washington 4-1 Saturday, a victory that improved Sanchez to 5-0 against the Nationals.	"I tried to make them swing at my pitches," Sanchez said. "I threw everything at every hitter."	Sanchez (12-9) gave up one run, struck out four and walked none. He has a 2.29 career ERA in 13 starts against the Nationals, going 2-0 this year. Wilson Ramos' RBI double in the eighth was the first earned run Sanchez allowed against Washington in 23 1/3 innings.	Sanchez was coming off of his worst performance of the season, giving up seven runs and seven hits in four innings at Philadelphia on Monday. He quickly showed he was back in form against the Nationals. Sanchez didn't allow a runner until Michael Morse's double in the fifth inning.	"You can tell with Anibal by the third inning if his breaking ball is working and around the plate -- he's going to have a good game," Florida manager Edwin Rodriguez said. "Whenever he's throwing his secondary pitches for strikes, chances are he's going to have a good game."	Washington (60-82) dropped a season-high 22 games under .500 and clinched a fifth straight losing season after yet again failing to make a dent against Sanchez.	"He's been good every time we've seen him," Nationals manager Jim Riggleman said. "We're going to have to figure something out on him."	Emilio Bonifacio gave Sanchez all the offense he needed with a two-run single in the fifth inning. Logan Morrison added an RBI single in the eighth inning to extend his hitting streak to 10 games. It was the 31st straight game he's reached base safely, the longest active streak in the majors.	"I'm sure since you just told me that I'm not going to get on base tomorrow," Morrison joked with a reporter after the game. "I don't think about it. I have no idea."	Clay Hensley pitched the ninth inning for his second save in five chances	Jason Marquis (2-8) also had a strong start, but couldn't match Sanchez. Marquis, who had surgery to remove bone chips from his elbow in May and was on the disabled list for 3 1/2 months, gave up two runs and five hits in six innings. He struck out eight -- his highest total since Sept. 1, 2008 -- and walked one.	"Today was probably the best I've felt since the surgery," Marquis said. "I had good bite on my slider. It was the first time all year I really had a good feel for it."	Neither pitcher allowed a hit through the first four innings, and the only runner to reach was Morrison on first baseman Adam Dunn's fielding error in the first inning.	Chad Tracy led off the fifth inning with a grounder up the middle. Mike Stanton followed with another single and Marquis walked Cameron Maybin to load the bases with no outs. After a pair of strikeouts, Bonifacio singled to center on a 3-2 pitch.	Morrison nearly added another run for the Marlins, but Nationals rookie second baseman Danny Espinosa made a diving stop and threw out Morrison by a step to end the inning.	Dunn's second error, on Brad Davis' ninth-inning grounder, scored an unearned run. Maybin led off with a triple.	Game notes	 Marlins RHP Jason Johnson, who missed Friday's scheduled start with shoulder and back problems, didn't throw in the bullpen on Saturday. Rodriguez said that if Johnson isn't able to throw on Sunday, he'll likely miss his next turn Wednesday against Philadelphia. If Johnson is unable to pitch, Florida would use several relievers Wednesday. ... Nationals reliever Collin Balester got his legs tangled up and fell to the ground during a pickoff attempt to second base, without throwing the ball. No balk was called. "That was the weirdest thing that ever happened to me," Balester said. "I looked at the replay, and it just looked like moving parts. I didn't know what I was doing."	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

TORONTO -- Thanks to another strong start from Wade Davis, the Tampa Bay Rays made a six-run inning stand up this time.	Brad Hawpe hit a grand slam, Davis won his seventh straight decision and the Rays routed the Toronto Blue Jays 13-1 Saturday.	"Of course you're going to look at the offensive outburst, but Wade Davis really pitched well today. He permitted that to happen," Rays manager Joe Maddon said. "I thought he had really good stuff. He had a good look about him. That set the whole thing up."	Kelly Shoppach also homered as the AL wild-card leaders won for the third time in four games.	Davis (12-9) improved to 3-0 with a 3.24 ERA in four starts since a stint on the 15-day disabled list caused by a strained right shoulder.	"He's come off the injury and I believe he's throwing the ball better than I've ever seen," Maddon said. "I'm talking about last year in September, and I'm talking at any point during this season. I'm talking velocity, depth on breaking ball, demeanor on the mound, awareness. All those things are getting better and that's why he's pitched so well."	Tampa Bay scored six runs in the first inning of Friday's series opener but blew an 8-1 lead before winning 9-8.	This time, Davis made sure there'd be no Toronto comeback. The right-hander, who leads AL rookies in wins, allowed one run and seven hits in seven innings, struck out six and walked three.	"I felt good and I felt under control," Davis said. "My fastball was good, my command was good early and I established it. To get a big lead like that it makes things a little easier."	Davis, who has not lost since June 27 against Arizona, matched Jeff Niemann (2009-10) and Mark Hendrickson (2005) for the most consecutive victories in Rays history.	Not surprisingly, Davis said his confidence is soaring.	"It's definitely higher than it's ever been," he said. "Not in an arrogant way at all, just as far as being able to repeat my delivery. If you can repeat your delivery, you're going to be able to make pitches and I've been doing that pretty good lately."	Hawpe's homer was his second with the Rays, who signed him to a minor league contract on Aug. 27. He went 2 for 5 and scored twice.	Shoppach hit a two-run homer off Rommie Lewis in the eighth.	Lyle Overbay replied with a solo shot for the Blue Jays, who have connected in 13 straight games, matching a season high. Toronto also went deep in 13 consecutive games from July 3-20.	Toronto leads the majors with 223 home runs, including a big league-high 127 at home.	Ricky Romero (12-9) allowed six runs, three hits and three walks in four innings, striking out seven. He breezed through the first three innings, allowing just a single to Evan Longoria, but gave up six runs in the fourth.	Jason Bartlett drew a leadoff walk, Romero hit Carl Crawford with a pitch and Ben Zobrist hit a two-run double with one out. Romero loaded the bases with walks to Carlos Pena and Sean Rodriguez, and Hawpe homered to right for his third career slam and first this season.	"Romero was really good in the beginning and then all of a sudden we jumped on him and had that big inning," Maddon said. "Of course, Brad's grand slam really put us over the top. He had some really good at bats today."	Romero had no explanation for his sudden lapse in command.	"It's one of those mysterious things that happens in baseball, you just lose it all of a sudden," Romero said. "I don't know how to explain it. I think that for the first time all year I got frustrated at myself for not throwing strikes."	Overbay homered off Davis in the fourth, but the Rays made it to 7-1 when Zobrist and Pena hit back-to-back doubles off Brad Mills in the fifth.	Toronto loaded the bases in the bottom half but, after a visit by pitching coach Jim Hickey, Davis struck out Overbay to end the threat.	Game notes	 Crawford tripled and is 15 for 32 with nine extra base hits, including four triples, in the past eight games. ... Toronto 3B Edwin Encarnacion, out since Aug. 29 with a sore left wrist, rejoined the team Saturday and is eligible to come off the 15-day DL Monday. ... The Rays are a major league-best 33-17 when facing a left-handed starter. ... Rays OF Desmond Jennings got his first major league hit, a pinch-double in the eighth. ... Tampa Bay is a major league-best 43-29 on the road.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ATLANTA -- Alex Gonzalez got the fly ball he wanted.	It was just a bonus that the drive cleared the left-field wall.	Gonzalez hit a three-run homer in the 12th inning and the Atlanta Braves beat the St. Louis Cardinals 6-3 on Saturday to move into a tie for the NL East lead.	With runners on first and third and the outfielders playing shallow to guard against a sacrifice fly, Gonzalez hit the winning shot off Mitchell Boggs.	"I tried to hit a fly ball deep," Gonzalez said. "I got it deep enough."	The Braves improved their major league-best home record to 51-20 and grabbed a share of the division lead with the Philadelphia Phillies, who lost to the New York Mets 4-3.	Albert Pujols had three RBIs for St. Louis, giving him 102 for the year and 10 straight seasons with more than 100 RBIs.	"I play aggressive," Pujols said when asked about the milestone. "Nobody can take that away from me. ... I try to do everything I can to help my team."	Gonzalez was 0 for 5 before connecting for his fifth homer since he joined Atlanta in a July trade with Toronto. He struck out with the bases loaded to end the first inning and struck out again in the seventh with two runners on base.	Gonzalez made the most of his one hit.	"He crushed that ball," Braves manager Bobby Cox said. "He had a few chances today and he didn't get it done, but boy he did in that inning. He's a great player."	Boggs said he "didn't back off" when facing Gonzalez but left the pitch too high.	"That was everything I had," Boggs said.	Catcher Brian McCann, who called the win "the funnest game of the year," said the Braves were not watching the Phillies' score.	"We're not looking at that game," he said. "We just have to keep playing."	St. Louis is facing an uphill climb to return to the playoffs. The Cardinals were six games back of NL Central-leading Cincinnati and 6½ back in the wild-card race before Saturday's games.	Boggs (2-3) walked Rick Ankiel with one out in the 12th and pinch-hitter Eric Hinske followed with a single up the middle, putting runners on the corners.	Cardinals manager Tony La Russa visited the mound but left Boggs in to face Gonzalez, who now has 22 homers on the year.	Rookie Craig Kimbrel (3-0) struck out two in a perfect 12th to get the win.	Jason Heyward hit a leadoff drive off Dennys Reyes in the seventh to give Atlanta a 3-2 lead. The rookie is batting .429 (36 for 84) with five homers and 15 RBIs in his last 21 games.	The Cardinals tied it in the eighth, taking advantage when third baseman Martin Prado bobbled Pedro Feliz's grounder. Prado's one-out error loaded the bases for Pujols, who drove in Brendan Ryan with a grounder off Peter Moylan.	Pujols also had a tying two-run double in the sixth.	Georgia native Jake Westbrook pitched six innings for the Cardinals, yielding two runs and seven hits. The right-hander, who was acquired in a trade with Cleveland on July 31, walked five and struck out three.	Atlanta's Tommy Hanson gave up two runs and five hits in seven innings.	Westbrook, who walked eight batters in 44 innings over his first seven starts with the Cardinals, issued consecutive walks to Derrek Lee and Nate McLouth to force in a run in the first. McLouth added a run-scoring triple in the fifth.	Westbrook lives in Danielsville, Ga., about 90 minutes from Atlanta. He pitched only two days after his wife, Heather, gave birth to a girl, Harper, in Atlanta.	Westbrook was making his second career appearance in Atlanta, following a loss with the Indians on June 19, 2004.	Game notes	 La Russa said LHP Trever Miller will meet the team in St. Louis after the series. La Russa said Miller, who has soreness in his left elbow, is making progress and is expecting to play catch on Sunday. ... Former Cardinals slugger Ankiel ended a streak of strikeouts in nine straight at-bats when he grounded out to end the ninth inning. ... Attendance was 51,078, the season's second-largest total at Turner Field, trailing only the opening day total of 53,081 against the Cubs.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

The right-hander slapped the ball into the reliever's glove, then made a slow, head-down walk to the New York Mets' dugout. Not the body language one would expect to see after a dominant outing.	Was Pelfrey peeved?	Not after pitching into the eighth inning to earn his career-high 14th victory, getting help from Ike Davis and beating the Philadelphia Phillies 4-3 Saturday to stop the NL East leaders' four-game winning streak.	"You always want to stay in," Pelfrey said, "but I know that I left a fastball up to [Ross] Gload and I hung a splitter to [Shane] Victorino, and I think that when you're starting to leave the ball up, maybe it's a sign that you're getting a little tired."	Pelfrey often is moody on the mound, and manager Jerry Manuel thinks the pitcher is beginning to show his potential as a front line starter -- and it couldn't come sooner. He might have to step up next year with ace Johan Santana out an undetermined amount of time for shoulder surgery.	"I'm hopeful this is the Pelfrey you'll see the rest of his career," Manuel said. "There's still growth for him and I feel very comfortable that he can get to that next level."	Davis kept up his big September with four hits and three RBIs, and Jose Reyes homered, helping quiet the many red-clad Philadelphia fans in the Citi Field crowd of 35,788.	New York was able to slow the surging Phillies in their pursuit of a fourth straight East title even without center fielder Carlos Beltran, who sat out with tendinitis in his left knee. He said the injury was a result of overcompensating during the rehabilitation of his surgically repaired right knee this spring. Beltran is day to day.	The Phillies fell into a tie with Atlanta after the Braves beat St. Louis 6-3. This was the first of their final 20 games, all against teams in the East -- Philadelphia dropped to 29-24 against the division but made it close by rallying for three runs in the eighth.	Hisanori Takahashi gave up a one-out double off the left-field wall to pinch-hitter Mike Sweeney, then retired Wilson Valdez and pinch-hitter Carlos Ruiz on groundouts for his sixth save in six chances.	"When he first hit it, I thought it had a chance but its a big yard," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said of Sweeney's drive that hit above the 384-foot sign.	The Mets held a brief pregame ceremony to mark the anniversary of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano was in attendance. Both teams lined up along the first- and third-base lines as a video tribute was shown and a New York City firefighter sang the national anthem. Several first responders threw out ceremonial first pitches.	Pelfrey (14-9) then didn't allow a runner past first base until Jayson Werth reached second on Raul Ibanez's single in the seventh. Pelfrey bested his 13 victories in 2008, needing three tries to get No. 14. He had a 10.38 ERA in his first two attempts at the win.	"He's legitimately having ups and downs," Jerry Manuel said. "And all young pitchers will have that for a period until they find exactly how to pitch when they don't have their best stuff."	Pelfrey allowed two runs and six hits, struck out five and walked none.	Parnell allowed a single to Placido Polanco and was lifted for Pedro Feliciano. After an out, Ryan Howard hit a two-run single to make it 4-3. Manny Acosta struck out Werth to end the eighth.	Davis had an RBI ground-rule double down the right-field line off Kyle Kendrick (9-9) in the first. He added a two-run single off J.C. Romero that made it 4-1 in the seventh after Jose Contreras intentionally walked David Wright to load the bases. Davis is 16 for 34 (.471) in 10 September games with 10 RBIs.	"Ike is constantly making adjustments as the opposition is adjusting for him," Jerry Manuel said, "which is a sign that he is a good player."	With the late-afternoon shadows creeping past the pitcher's mound and out to right field, Reyes sent a drive into the deck overhanging the right field wall for a 2-0 lead in the third.	Kendrick, whose spot in the rotation has been tenuous after posting a 7.84 ERA in his last four starts, was pulled after five innings and 64 pitches. He allowed two runs, five hits and two walks.	"It was all right," Kendrick said. "Not happy with the loss but pitch count was still low."	Game notes	 Phillies SS Jimmy Rollins sat out his second straight game because of tightness in his right hamstring. manager Charlie Manuel said there is no guarantee he'll be ready to play Sunday. ... Even with win, the Mets are just 21-27 in one-run games. The Phillies are 25-15. ... The Mets ran into two double plays started by outfielders on flyballs.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

SAN DIEGO -- Yorvit Torrealba made sure the San Diego Padres did not lose their NL West lead for the first time in nearly three months.	Torrealba homered, then threw out Darren Ford on an attempted steal of second base for a double play that ended Saturday's 1-0 win over the San Francisco Giants.	San Francisco had won the first two games of the series, closing within one percentage point in the division race as the Padres lost for the 13th time in 15 games. The victory boosted San Diego's margin back to one game.	"Torrealba pretty much won the game for us," Padres closer Heath Bell said. "He hasn't been hitting the ball lately, then he hits a home run. Then he comes up big by throwing Ford out. With us, you never know who is going to come up big."	Tim Stauffer (4-3), a long reliever making his third start of the season, allowed three hits in six innings and pitched out of his only jam in the second. Stauffer is 1-0 with a 0.60 ERA in those starts.	"Amazing. Amazing," Torrealba said of Stauffer's outing. "He's been in the bullpen all year long, and for him to step up and keep us in the game, it was amazing."	Three relievers completed the three-hitter, with Bell getting his 40th save in 43 chances after Luke Gregerson and Mike Adams pitched an inning each. Bell reached 40 saves for the second straight season.	"That's how we have done it all year," Bell said. "It stands out more now, though, because we lost most of our lead and we are getting it back in September, when everyone is paying attention."	San Diego, which has not been out of first place since June 16, had a 6 1/2-game lead before play on Aug. 26. The Padres have 21 games remaining and the Giants have 19.	San Francisco, which had won nine of 12, hasn't been in first place since May 6.	"We just couldn't do anything offensively," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "We had an opportunity but just couldn't cash it in."	The teams complete the series Sunday, with the red-hot Mat Latos (14-5) starting for Padres against two-time NL Cy Young Award winner Tim Lincecum (13-9).	"If we win Sunday, it puts them two games back and, basically, puts us in the driver's seat again," Bell said.	It will be hard for Sunday's game to match the drama of Saturday's.	Aubrey Huff was hit in the right elbow by a pitch with one out -- Huff also was hit in the same spot Friday and scored in San Francisco's 1-0 win. But Bell closed out this victory when Buster Posey struck out, and Torrealba threw out Ford, who pinch ran for Huff.	Rookie Madison Bumgarner (5-5) allowed three hits in seven innings, retiring 13 straight batters after Torrealba's homer. He has allowed two runs or fewer in five of his last six starts.	"One pitch," Bumgarner said. "That's just the way it goes sometimes. He just got me. I don't know it was that bad of a pitch."	Stauffer worked his way out of trouble after Jose Guillen doubled with one out in the second, Pat Burrell walked and Jose Uribe singled. Stauffer retired Edgar Renteria on a popout and Bumgarner on a groundout.	"Once I got through the second, I didn't really labor too much," Stauffer said after his longest outing this season. "I felt really good out there and just tried not to think too much about the fact I hadn't pitch this long for a while."	Stauffer made an emergency start Monday against the Los Angeles Dodgers in place of Latos, who was ill, and pitched four strong innings as the Padres stopped a 10-game skid with a 4-2 win.	Torrealba's fifth homer landed in the right-field porch in the third inning. The drive on an 0-1 pitch landed about five rows deep. Torrealba had two of the Padres' four hits.	"When I hit it, I thought it was going to go off the wall," Torrealba said.	San Diego has won six 1-0 games, including three against the Giants. The offense-challenged Padres were held to four runs or fewer for the 15th straight game, the club's longest such streak since 1990 when they did it in 16 consecutive games.	Game notes	 The only other time the Padres had a game-ending double-play consisting of a strikeout and throwing a runner out attempting to steal was Sept. 10, 1970 against Atlanta. ... Giants 3B Pablo Sandoval was held out of the starting lineup for the second straight game. Sandoval is hitting .167 (3 for 18) in the first eight games of a 10-game trip. Bochy said Sandoval was expected to start in Sunday's finale. ... Padres manager Bud Black said utilityman Jerry Hairston Jr. (right elbow sprain) and CF Tony Gwynn Jr. (broken right hamate) will both travel with the club when for the start of a 10-game trip Monday in Colorado. Both players are expected to come off the 15-day DL.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

CHICAGO -- The White Sox ran into Kyle Davies at the wrong time.	Davies pitched six solid innings, Gregor Blanco and Kila Ka'aihue each had three hits and the Kansas City Royals beat Chicago 8-2 on Saturday night.	Blanco and Ka'aihue each scored two runs as Kansas City roughed up Edwin Jackson (3-1) on its way to 18 hits. The Royals snapped a four-game losing streak.	Davies (8-9) allowed one run and five hits, winning consecutive starts for the first time this season. The right-hander also improved to 2-0 with a 3.38 ERA in his last four starts against Chicago, dating to Sept. 20, 2008.	"I'm pitching better in September. ... I don't think there's any explanation for it," said Davies, who turned 27 on Thursday. "I've won two games already in the month and I'm pitching pretty well. I pitched better in the first month, too.	"I think middle of the season, you look at the game, I wasn't commanding the ball at all. I'm commanding the ball a lot better now and that's going to lead to better results."	Davies struck out five and walked two, throwing 64 of his 102 pitches for strikes and impressing manager Ned Yost.	"This is his third or fourth really good start he's put together in a row," Yost said. "I'm looking for consistency and he's starting to develop it. It's starting to look that way, anyway."	Paul Konerko hit his 34th homer for the White Sox, who have lost four of five. They trailed AL Central-leading Minnesota by five games before Saturday's action.	White Sox catcher A.J. Pierzynski doesn't think the pressure of keeping up with the Twins is taking a toll on the team.	"Everyone is right there and energetic and into the games and doing everything they can but everyone has bad games and when you're in the middle of September and in a pennant race and you're trying to catch a team they get magnified," he said, "and that's the way this game works."	Jackson had been outstanding since he was acquired in a trade with Arizona on July 30, going 3-0 with a 2.05 ERA in his first six starts with Chicago.	This one was much different.	Kansas City scored in each of the first three innings and five of the first six to build a 6-1 lead.	Blanco walked and scored on Wilson Betemit's single in the first. Yuniesky Betancourt hit a sacrifice fly and Blanco had an RBI double in the second. Pena doubled in a run in the third to make it 4-0.	"I felt good, but sometimes the days you feel good are the days you get hit and the days you feel bad you go out and do well," Jackson said. "It was just one of those days, what can you do? Once it's over it's over, you just forget about it and get ready for the next one."	Betemit and Mitch Maier also had three hits apiece for Kansas City, which improved to 8-9 against the White Sox this season. Pena finished with two RBIs.	"These guys are going for the division. It's only the right thing to do play the game and put your best lineup out there," Ka'aihue said. "In fairness to Minnesota, that's what we did to them, and we're doing the same to Chicago. You want to play spoiler in this situation, just for the other teams in the division."	Jackson, who allowed six runs and a season-high 13 hits in five-plus innings, was hurt by his defense in the second. With Alex Gordon on third and the infield playing in with one out, second baseman Gordon Beckham fielded Chris Getz's bouncer and tried unsuccessfully to get Gordon at third.	Gordon scored on Betancourt's fly ball and Getz eventually came home when Blanco legged out a double, sliding past shortstop Alexei Ramirez's tag.	Ramirez reacted to second base umpire Joe West's call and manager Ozzie Guillen, who was kicked out of Friday's game for arguing a balk, took a step out of the dugout, waved his hand and returned to the dugout. Guillen has been ejected by West's crew twice this season.	Konerko doubled and scored on Ramirez's two-out single in the fourth, cutting Kansas City's lead to 4-1, but Gordon singled in a run in the fifth and Maier chased Jackson with an RBI single in the sixth.	Konerko's homer came in the eighth against Gil Meche.	Game notes	 White Sox RHP Freddy Garcia was scratched from his scheduled start Sunday with a sore lower back. Guillen said RHP Lucas Harrell will get the start instead. ... Yost said RHP Brian Bannister will pitch out of the bullpen for the rest of the season. He has made 23 starts this season. ... Royals DH Billy Butler established a franchise record with a hit in 97 consecutive series.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

CLEVELAND -- Jim Thome gets a thrill out of pounding a baseball over a fence, especially to win a game. It's still there, after 20 seasons in the majors.	Thome connected in the 12th inning Saturday night for career homer No. 587, passing Hall of Famer Frank Robinson for eighth place on the career list and lifting the Minnesota Twins to a 1-0 win over the Cleveland Indians.	"It's kind of humbling and pretty neat," Thome said. "We're trying to scratch out any kind of run and to see the ball go out of the park is pretty special."	Thome hit a 2-0 pitch from Justin Germano (0-2) into the Indians bullpen in center field, snapping the Twins' 21-inning scoreless streak. It was the game's only extra-base hit.	"We got beat by one of the greatest home run hitters this game has ever seen," Indians manager Manny Acta said.	Thome returned to the lineup after missing two games with a mild abdominal strain and was 0 for 3 with a walk until hitting his fifth homer in his last four games. He had been 5 for 6 with four homers, a double, five walks and seven RBIs in his previous three games.	Matt Guerrier (4-7) worked out of a two-on, none-out jam in the 11th for the win, the Twins' seventh in eight games. Matt Capps got three outs for his 12th save in 14 chances since being acquired July 29 from Washington, where he had 26 saves.	"Just great pitching by both teams," Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said. "You can't pitch much better. It didn't look like we were going to score for 50 innings."	Thome's homer was his 186th at Progressive Field, where he played from 1994 through 2002 for the Indians.	"I have more memories here than I can remember," Thome said. "We had a lot of great players and great teams with postseason memories and great fans."	The Twins signed Thome over the winter, hoping the 40-year-old could help them reach the playoffs. He is batting .278 with 23 homers and 53 RBIs in 97 games, a key reason why Minnesota has a six-game lead over Chicago in the AL Central despite missing slugger Justin Morneau for two months with a concussion.	"We watched Thome kill us for all those years, so it's nice to have him on our side killing somebody else," Gardenhire said. "He's a Hall of Famer who gives us a huge presence."	Thome's 57 homers against the Twins are second to the 63 he has hit against Detroit.	Twins starter Nick Blackburn held the Indians hitless for five innings. The right-hander allowed five hits over eight innings, walking two and striking out three.	Indians starter Carlos Carrasco gave up five hits over 7 1/3 innings, leaving after walking Denard Span in the eighth. Rafael Perez then got Orlando Hudson to hit into a double play, the third turned by Cleveland to end an inning.	Carrasco remained winless in three starts since being called up from Triple-A Columbus on Sept. 1. It was his eighth start for the Indians, who got him from Philadelphia as part of the July 2009 trade for Cliff Lee.	Cleveland nearly scored against Blackburn in the seventh. Travis Hafner singled and went to third on a hit-and-run single to right by Trevor Crowe. Jason Donald then put down a safety squeeze bunt -- but was called out when plate umpire Brian Gorman ruled the ball bounced up and hit Donald in the hand for interference.	Hafner, who had slid home with the apparent first run, was sent back to third and Crowe back to first. Luis Valbuena then popped out to second base to end the threat.	Donald left with a bruised right hand and will be examined by a hand specialist Sunday.	"When he shook his hand [running to first], it looked like the ball hit him in front of home plate," Acta said. "That's what I saw from the dugout and that's what the umpire saw. Actually, he was shaking his hand because the ball hit his hand [when he bunted it]."	After going 1-6 with a 9.88 ERA over nine starts June 1-July 18, Blackburn was moved to the bullpen, then sent to Triple-A Rochester. In four starts since returning to the Twins' rotation, he is 2-1 with a 1.76 ERA.	Game notes	 Rain delayed the start for 1 hour, 50 minutes. ... Three umpires worked the game when Angel Campos, scheduled to handle duties behind the plate, became ill before the start. Gorman moved from first base to the plate. Tony Randazzo and Paul Nauert worked the bases. ... Acta said RHP Justin Masterson will work out of the bullpen to close the season in order to limit his innings. "He's got eight innings left and we'll try to use him in meaningful situations," Acta said. Masterson has pitched 166 innings in 28 games, all starts. ... Indians OF Michael Brantley extended his hitting streak to 12 games, tying Hafner for the longest by a Cleveland player this year.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DETROIT -- The Baltimore Orioles know that, at 32 games under .500, they are miles away from any kind of pennant race as the regular season enters its final weeks.	Still, for once, they feel like they have a reason to finish the season with more than a token effort.	Saturday, Adam Jones had four hits and Jeremy Guthrie pitched seven shutout innings to help the Orioles beat the Detroit Tigers 5-3. Baltimore is now 23-14 since Buck Showalter took over as manager on Aug. 2.	"We finally feel like we're getting better and taking some momentum into September," Guthrie said. "We're actually racing to the finish line instead of limping toward it like we've done in the past couple years."	Brian Roberts and Felix Pie each added three hits for Baltimore, which clinched a win of the three-game series that concludes Sunday. Before this week, Baltimore had lost five straight at Comerica Park and 12 of its last 16.	"What this team is learning is that, if you play good baseball, you can win anywhere," Showalter said. "That's what I've told them -- the teams that play deep into October are the teams that can win on the road. That's what we will have to do in the years to come."	Guthrie (10-13) gave up five hits -- all in the first three innings -- and one walk, striking out four. Guthrie has won his last three starts with an ERA of 0.81.	"He's been a very solid pitcher, and that's a big understatement," Showalter said. "He's the kind of starting pitcher you need if you want to compete in our division."	Koji Uehara pitched the ninth for his ninth save and second in as many days.	Max Scherzer (10-10) allowed four runs on a career-high 12 hits in six innings, snapping a five-start unbeaten streak. Scherzer has allowed four runs in each of his last two starts after not allowing more than two in the previous seven.	"He was up in the zone a bit, and I don't think his secondary stuff was as good as it has been," Tigers manager Jim Leyland said. "He gave up some hits, but he still did a good job of keeping us in the game."	The teams combined for eight hits in the first three innings, but Scherzer and Guthrie were able to pitch out of the jams.	"I didn't have my best stuff tonight, but I battled with the bullets I had," Guthrie said. "I gave up too many baserunners in the first few innings, but I was able to make some pitches when I needed them."	The Orioles got three more hits in the fourth, loading the bases with one out, but Scherzer struck out Josh Bell and Cesar Izturis to end the inning.	Baltimore finally broke the tie with four runs in the sixth. Jones led off with a double, took third on a wild pitch and scored on Pie's two-base hit.	Bell followed with an infield single and Izturis made it 3-0 with a triple. Scherzer retired Roberts, but Ty Wigginton drove in Izturis with a long sacrifice fly.	"You look at the way Scherzer has been pitching -- he's one of the hottest guys in the American League right now," Showalter said. "We were getting good at-bats against him, but he kept making enough pitches to get out of things. That's why it was such a good sign that we took our time and found a way to put a bunch of hits together in the sixth."	With Guthrie out of the game, though, Detroit rallied for three runs off Matt Albers in the eighth. Don Kelly started the rally with an RBI single and Jhonny Peralta followed with a two-run double before Albers retired Brandon Inge with the tying run on second.	Pie finished the scoring with an RBI single off Brad Thomas in the ninth.	"We just didn't do enough offensively," Leyland said. "We had the one spurt in the eighth, but we couldn't get enough, and that add-on run in the ninth just killed us."	Game notes	 The start of the game was delayed 27 minutes by rain. ... There was an odd moment during Baltimore's big sixth inning when fans in the top row of the upper deck behind third base started tossing beach balls to nearby fans. About 20 balls were distributed, many getting as far as the lower deck, before security guards were able to confiscate all of them. ... Miguel Cabrera hit a sixth-inning grounder so hard that it deflected off Bell's glove at third to Izturis 10 yards away quickly enough for an easy 5-6-3 putout. ... Baltimore's starters are 3-0 with five quality starts as Baltimore has gone 4-1 on its current roadtrip.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

HOUSTON -- Dodgers manager Joe Torre wasn't around to see the wild ending of Los Angeles' victory.	Reliever Brandon Lyon's threw away a bunt for a tiebreaking two-run error in a three-run ninth inning, giving the Los Angeles Dodgers a 6-3 win over the Houston Astros on Saturday night.	Torre was ejected in the first inning by plate umpire Paul Emmel. Torre complained from the dugout after Casey Blake was called out on strikes, then left the dugout following the ejection to speak with Emmel.	"I wasn't around long enough to see much but it turned out good," Torre said.	Torre said he was defending his player.	"The umpire looked over and says 'that's enough, I don't want to hear it.' and I said 'then get it right.' He warned me and I said it again and he threw me out. I didn't curse him and I shouldn't have been thrown out. I'm just glad we had a good result."	With the score 3-3, Trent Oeltjen singled off Lyon (6-6) and Reed Johnson reached on a bunt single down the first-base line.	A.J. Ellis bunted, and Lyon picked up the sacrifice, then hesitated and threw wildly to first as two runs scored. Ellis went to third on the error and scored on pinch-hitter James Loney's double.	"I was able to see from where I was running that the ball got through on a low throw," Ellis said. "I was trying to get everybody's attention to start running."	Kenley Jansen (1-0) pitched a perfect eighth inning to win his first major league decision in his 18th appearance.	"That's how you win and lose games is defense and making plays," Lyon said. "It just snowballed into that and before you know we were down some runs. Those were the games we've been winning as of late and tonight wasn't one of those days."	Dodgers starter John Ely, recalled Monday from Triple-A Albuquerque, made his first big league appearance since July 10 and allowed three runs and six hits in six innings with four strikeouts and one walked.	"We needed that from Ely," Torre said. "He started a little rough like he was trying to overthrow. But after three innings he seemed to smooth out. That was a quality start, six innings. He got in a jam and out of a jam. I was pleased and I know he had to be."	Ely acknowledged he was excited in the first inning.	"You get out there and get a little anxious," Ely said. "I settled in and got into a rhythm and kept the hitters off balance for the most part."	Astros starter Wandy Rodriguez gave up three runs and five hits in seven innings, matching his season high by striking out 10 for the third time.	"It was nice to see Wandy finish strong, even after what all happened there in the fourth inning," Astros manager Brad Mills said. "He had 10 strikeouts in seven innings. Other than the fourth inning, he threw the ball really well."	Blake's 15th homer, and run-scoring singles by Johnson and Ellis put the Dodgers ahead in a three-run fourth.	Michael Bourn tripled in the fourth and scored in Jeff Keppinger's single. Brett Wallace homered leading off the sixth, and Bourn's RBI groundout tied it.	"I got a pretty good pitch to hit there, and I did. I think, like I've said all along, it's just a matter of being comfortable," Wallace said. "I think that I am finally back to being aggressive in my game plan. I feel good up there, and hopefully I can continue with that."	Game notes	 Dodgers Triple-A Albuquerque manager Tim Wallach will spend the remainder of the season as a coach with the Dodgers. ... Torre's ejection was his second this season and his fourth as Dodger's manager. ... Former Astros C Brad Ausmus is to start against his old team in Sunday's series finale.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.

MILWAUKEE -- After a rough couple of starts, this was one memorable victory for Ryan Dempster.	Dempster struck out eight in seven crisp innings, earning his 100th career win and helping the Chicago Cubs beat the Milwaukee Brewers 1-0 on Saturday night.	"Just to get to the big leagues is one thing, but to win 100 games is a special thing," the 33-year-old right-hander said. "It really is. It means a lot. Especially coming from Canada, there's not a lot of people that have done it. It really gives me a greater appreciation for those guys out there that have won 300 games."	Dempster (13-10) was coming off a pair of shaky starts, both double-digit losses for Chicago. He allowed seven runs over three innings in a 14-7 loss to Pittsburgh on Aug. 31 and yielded seven runs -- three earned -- over 4 2/3 innings in a 18-5 drubbing by the New York Mets last Sunday.	"It's been a struggle my last couple times out," he said. "So to go out there and throw the ball well again felt good. Your team throws a shutout, great job by all the guys in the bullpen. It was a lot of fun."	Dempster allowed three hits and walked two, improving to 15-2 with a 2.90 ERA in 22 career starts against the Brewers. The right-hander retired 21 of the first 26 batters on his way to his 50th victory with Chicago.	"He was really sharp tonight," Cubs interim manager Mike Quade said after the club improved to 6-2 at Miller Park this season.	Xavier Nady homered for Chicago, which got an outstanding outing from Carlos Zambrano in a 4-0 victory in the series opener Friday night.	Randy Wolf (11-11) pitched eight innings for Milwaukee, yielding four hits and one walk. The left-hander is 4-2 with a 3.07 ERA in nine starts since he was roughed up at Pittsburgh on July 21, yielding 12 runs and 13 hits in 5 2/3 innings.	His only mistake was the 0-1 curveball out over the plate that Nady hit for his sixth homer in the seventh inning, banging the drive off the left-field foul pole.	"That ball just stayed true," Wolf said. "It's a matter of probably six to eight inches of allowing a foul ball or home run."	Nady said he thought it was going to be foul "by 10 or 15 feet."	"I was almost to the point where I wasn't even going to run to first because I thought I pulled it that far foul," he said.	Milwaukee put runners on first and second in the eighth before Andrew Cashner struck out Ryan Braun for the second out. Sean Marshall then came in and fanned Prince Fielder to end the inning.	Carlos Marmol pitched the ninth for his 30th save in 35 chances.	Casey McGehee reached on an infield single in the fourth, Wolf had a base hit in the fifth and Alcides Escobar singled in the seventh for Milwaukee's only hits.	Dempster is 4-0 with a 2.23 ERA in five starts against Milwaukee this season. He has won his last four road starts for the first time since a career-high five in a row for the Marlins in 2001.	Asked if there was something about Milwaukee that he liked, he said jokingly, "The brats are awesome. I enjoy this field. I enjoy the atmosphere here in the clubhouse. It's a great mound to throw off of. For whatever reason I have had some success here."	Brewers manager Ken Macha said Dempster gave his hitters trouble all night.	"Our guys keep saying they can't see the spin on his slider," Macha said.	Dempster made his major league debut with Florida in 1998 and also has played for the Cincinnati Reds. He also had 87 saves for Chicago from 2004-07.

CINCINNATI -- Even Joey Votto had to stop and watch this one.	Votto led off the bottom of the 10th inning with his 33rd homer, sending the Cincinnati Reds to a 5-4 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Saturday night that extended their NL Central lead to a daunting seven games and left the crowd chanting "MVP!"	Votto hit the fourth pitch from Justin Thomas (0-1) toward the stands in left-center, dropped his bat and watched the first game-ending homer of his career.	"It was really cool," Votto said.	After getting swamped by teammates at home plate, he took a curtain call for ending a back-and-forth game with one swing.	"Thank God for Joey Votto," manager Dusty Baker said. "That was MVP stuff right there. That's what people come to see. That's what we've come to expect."	Before the game, the Reds commemorated the 25th anniversary of Pete Rose's record-setting hit No. 4,192 at Cinergy Field. The 69-year-old Rose got Major League Baseball's permission to go on the field -- otherwise prohibited under his lifetime ban for gambling -- and step on first base while the crowd of 36,101 cheered.	Then, the Reds got a little closer to their first playoff appearance since 1995.	"Wow, wild game," said Chris Heisey, who tied it in the ninth with a double. "Sometimes you can't describe it."	Edinson Volquez dominated through seven innings, giving up only one single and fanning a season-high 10 before turning a 3-0 lead over to the Reds bullpen.	Neil Walker's two-run single past hard-throwing Aroldis Chapman completed Pittsburgh's rally to a 4-3 lead in the eighth. Joel Hanrahan blew the save chance, giving up Heisey's tying double.	"We did some very nice things in that eighth inning," manager John Russell said. "It was real exciting. The guys have been doing some good things. The next step is winning."	Pittsburgh rarely does that on the road. The Pirates are 14-55 on the road this season, dropping 17 of their last 18.	Francisco Cordero (6-4) pitched a perfect 10th for the win.	They're already talking playoffs in Cincinnati, and Volquez put himself in the conversation with a dominating performance.	Baker has been trying to settle on a rotation with six currently healthy candidates. Right-hander Aaron Harang eliminated himself with two poor outings -- he's been moved to the bullpen.	Volquez returned in July after missing nearly a year because of reconstructive right elbow surgery. He was erratic and got sent to the minors on Aug. 31 to fix problems in his delivery. At that point, there was no telling whether he would be an integral part of the Reds' late-September plans.	He was sharp with all his pitches against the NL's worst team. Volquez gave up only one hit -- Jose Tabata's single that deflected off the end of shortstop Orlando Cabrera's glove in the first inning.	"Volquez was really nasty," Walker said.	Volquez had control of everything he threw, convincing the Reds that he's back in form and belongs back in the rotation.	"When he does that, he's about unhittable," Baker said. "Volquez was masterful tonight. That's the best he's pitched since he's been back."	Walker's single off Chapman extended his hitting streak to 17 games, the longest by a Pirates rookie since Rennie Stennett hit in 18 straight in 1971.	Game notes	 Tabata's single was his 100th hit. He and Walker are the first Pirates rookies to have 100 hits in the same season since Jose Guillen and Tony Womack did it in 1997. ... Heisey had a sore arm, leaving the Reds short-handed in the outfield. Miguel Cairo made his third career start in RF, his first since 2005. Heisey got into the game as a defensive replacement and wound up playing a pivotal role in the ninth-inning comeback.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- Mariano Rivera stood on the mound with his hands on his hips. He couldn't believe what he just did, couldn't believe the Yankees just found another wild way to lose.	And he probably wasn't too fond of the Texas Rangers celebrating as if they had won more than just a second straight marathon.	Pitching in the ninth inning with a one-run lead, Rivera allowed a tying double to Ian Kinsler, then plunked Jeff Francoeur on the left shoulder with the bases loaded, giving the Rangers a 7-6 victory over the Yankees on Saturday night.	New York had been a majors-best 76-0 when leading after eight innings. Rivera had never lost on a game-ending hit batter, according to STATS LLC.	It was the first time the Rangers had ever won a game on a plunked final batter. The last team to win that way was the Yankees, against the Athletics on July 19, 2008.	"That's a first for me; I'm pretty sure I won't see it again," Texas captain Michael Young said. "Against Mariano, you take it any way you can get it. It was fun to be involved in."	Long, too.	The game lasted 4 hours, 16 minutes, the second-longest nine-inning game in Rangers history. But that doesn't count the 59-minute rain delay in the bottom of the fifth. The really draining part is that it came the day after a 13-inning game that took 5 hours, 12 minutes.	Rivera (3-3) threw two innings in that game, but didn't blame the workload on his poor outing. It was his third blown save in 32 chances. He had nailed his last 11.	"In a situation like that, I can't walk the leadoff batter," Rivera said. "That's what bothers me most."	What he failed to mention is that the leadoff batter was Vladimir Guerrero, who from time to time will swing at anything from his cleats to his batting helmet, and from dugout to dugout.	Nelson Cruz, who hit solo homers for the tying and winning runs Friday night, followed with a long at-bat that ended with a single to right, moving pinch-runner Esteban German to third base. Then Kinsler doubled down the third-base line to tie it.	"I fell behind and he hit the ball in the perfect place," Rivera said. "He didn't hit it hard, he placed it. You want a ground ball, but it was in the right place."	After an intentional walk to load the bases, Rivera's first pitch hit Francoeur. His reaction probably overemphasized the blow, but it made certain what had happened.	"I was looking for that cutter, but it kept running and running and it hit me," Francoeur said. "I'll take it every day."	As Cruz trotted home for the winning run, teammates rushed to the greet him at the plate for a second straight night.	Team owner Nolan Ryan smiled and led the cheers from the front row. Much of the crowd of 49,210 -- second-largest this season -- stuck around to watch the Rangers win their fourth straight game, and second straight over a possible first-round playoff foe, all after blowing leads of 4-2 and 5-3.	"We enjoy these kind of games," Young said. "They're long and emotionally taxing, but they're the kind you want to be involved in."	The Yankees lost for the fifth time in six games. Their lead in the AL East dipped to a half-game because Tampa Bay beat Toronto 13-1.	Alex Rodriguez put New York ahead 6-5 with a three-run double in the eighth. But the Yankees ultimately were bitten by some earlier missed opportunities -- leaving the bases loaded in the second and sixth, and pinch-hitter Jorge Posada hitting into a double-play with one out and the bases loaded in the seventh.	Alexi Ogando (4-1) pitched the ninth for the victory.	Mark Teixeira was 2 for 4 and scored twice for New York. Lance Berkman went 2 for 3 with two walks and an RBI; he has seven hits in his last 12 at-bats. Francisco Cervelli reached base in his first four plate appearances, with a single and three walks. He also walked three times Friday night.	Guerrero had three hits and two RBIs. Francoeur broke a tie earlier in the game with a sacrifice fly. Elvis Andrus and Mitch Moreland also had RBIs.	It was hot and humid before the rain. New York starter A.J. Burnett seemed to have trouble with his grip late in innings, as his sweat built up. Neither starter returned after the rain delay.	Burnett gave up two runs and four hits over four innings, with six strikeouts and three walks.	Texas starter Tommy Hunter allowed two runs and six hits over five innings, with a career-high eight strikeouts.	Game notes	 Yankees SS Derek Jeter, mired in slumps of 2 for 18 and 7 for 61, did not start for just the sixth time this season. Manager Joe Girardi insisted it was because of the long game Friday night. ... Hunter, who has had two strikeout-free starts this season, got his eight Ks in the first 12 outs. ... Burnett ended all four of his innings with a strikeout. ... Posada is scheduled to be back behind the plate Sunday after missing three starts with concussion symptoms.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DENVER -- For the first time in weeks, Carlos Gonzalez and Troy Tulowitzki didn't do the heavy lifting for the Colorado Rockies.	Didn't matter.	The Rockies won their ninth straight game and stayed within striking distance of the NL West lead Saturday night thanks to a long list of unusual suspects and a couple of fortuitous moments.	Pinch-hitter Jonathan Herrera's sacrifice fly off Mike Hampton after a miscommunication on a squeeze play broke a seventh-inning tie and rookie Matt Reynolds (1-0) picked up his first major league win by working one scoreless inning in Colorado's 2-1 nail-biter over the Arizona Diamondbacks.	The Rockies stayed 2½ games behind San Diego in the NL West race. The Padres beat San Francisco 1-0.	"When you're on a really good roll, you'd like them all to be easy, but unfortunately, it's not going to be that way," Colorado manager Jim Tracy said. "And tonight we had to do it the hard way."	Diamondbacks right-hander Rodrigo Lopez cruised along until the seventh, when he gave up three straight hits, including Miguel Olivo's RBI single that tied it at 1 and took Ubaldo Jimenez off the hook for a hard-luck loss.	Jimenez had allowed one run over six stellar innings and stranded runners at third in three straight innings.	With switch-hitter Herrera coming up to pinch hit, Lopez (5-14) , who was aiming for his first victory since Aug 7, was replaced by lefty Mike Hampton, the 37-year-old lefty whose two years in Denver were marked by a big contract and lots of losses.	Herrera fouled off a pitch with Ryan Spilborghs bearing down on him at fullspeed on a squeeze play mix-up. Then, with that sign wiped off, Herrera lofted a fly that center fielder Chris Young had to back up on, allowing Spilborghs to score.	"You do make your own breaks," Arizona manager Kirk Gibson said. "They botched a sign there and the squeeze was on and Herrera had to hit ... and they got away with it."	Todd Helton also was out of the starting lineup, but Gibson took umbrage at the notion that the Rockies were any easier to face on this night.	"They also had Jimenez throwing," Gibson said. "I don't care who's in the lineup. You've got to play a baseball game."	And Herrera's a pretty good bat-handler, whether he's squaring around or squaring it up.	"We play like a team," Herrera said. "Everybody is part of it, not just the nine guys in the lineup. We have a lot of guys on the bench, too, and we're looking for anything to help the team win."	Lopez had been awful since Aug. 1, losing all four of his decisions. Against Colorado, he allowed just two runs on seven hits in 6 1/3 innings.	"Rodrigo threw a great game for us," Gibson said. "We got out-executed in the finer points of the game and they came away with a win."	Rafael Betancourt held the lead with a 1-2-3 eighth and Huston Street picked his 18th save in 22 chances. With one out and the tying run at second, Street struck out Gerardo Parra on high heat, then got pinch-hitter Ryan Church looking at strike three with the sellout crowd of 48,000-plus standing.	The Rockies didn't have their usually potent lineup.	Gonzalez's 0-for-8 hiccup over the previous two games prompted his manager to give him a breather. Gonzalez had started to show signs of fatigue after a career-best 16-game hitting streak that put him in contention for the Triple Crown and the Rockies in the thick of the playoff race.	With CarGo getting a night off -- until he played left field in the ninth -- Troy Tulowitzki, who's been on a power surge himself over the last week and a-half, moved up from the cleanup spot to the third spot in the order.	Tulowitzki went 0-for-4 from there after having hit .444 (16-for-36) over his previous nine games while collecting eight homers, 17 RBIs, 15 runs, five walks and a dozen extra-base hits.	Gonzalez's replacement in left field, Spilborghs, misplayed Tony Abreu's fourth-inning drive into a double and he couldn't catch up to Stephen Drew's RBI double an inning later that scored Brandon Allen.	Lopez, who had singled, had to stop at third on the hit.	"Fortunately for us the pitcher was running or they would have had two runs," Tracy said.	Game notes	 The Rockies are 18-4 at Coors Field since July 29. ... Street has saved nine straight games since Aug. 22. ... The sellout crowd of 48,023 included a September record walk-up of 7,673 Saturday.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Ervin Santana has five more wins than Felix Hernandez, who has Cy Young numbers in just about every other category -- including the best ERA in the AL and the highest strikeout total in the majors. Its the abysmal run support that has prevented the Seattle Mariners' ace from being one of the front-runners for the award.	Santana tied a career high for victories with his 16th, allowing three runs and five hits over 7 1/3 innings and striking out five in a 7-4 victory over the Mariners on Saturday night. Had Hernandez received that kind of run support, he wouldn't be saddled with a .500 record at this stage of the season.	"That's the part of it that's not right. I mean, for him to put up as many zeros as he has, his [won-lost] record shouldn't reflect [badly on] what he's done," Mariners second baseman Chone Figgins said. "The Cy Young is basically for the best pitcher. But if he doesn't get runs, that's not his fault. If his other numbers are up there than he deserves it and he should get it. But if I know him, he's going to continue to go out there and pitch to win."	Torii Hunter had four RBIs and Hideki Matsui homered for the Angels, helping Santana (16-9) match the win totals he had in 2006 and 2008. The right-hander was 3-1 with a 3.12 ERA in his five starts against the Mariners.	"It was a credit to us to do that to go out and do that to one of the best pitchers in the game," Hunter said. "Felix has been hot all of August and up until now. That guy is filthy, man. He's got some of the nastiest stuff, especially against righties. Right-handers are like sacrificial lambs. But tonight we came through."	Hernandez (11-11) was charged with seven runs -- four earned -- and three walks in 6 1/3 innings and struck out five. This was the sixth time in the 24-year-old right-hander's last 11 starts that his teammates didn't score while he was in the game. Hernandez has allowed 17 unearned runs this season, the most on the Seattle staff, but has given up just five earned runs in 51 1/3 innings over his last seven starts.	Hernandez was 0-3 with a 4.13 ERA in his five starts against the Angels, three of which were against Angels ace Jered Weaver.	"We were just trying to stay up the middle and not try to pull the ball -- because we've always been in trouble when we do," Hunter added. "We've faced him so much, so tonight we tried to work him and get his pitch count up so that hopefully he'd get out of there. But he's such a bulldog, he doesn't care if he has 130 pitches. He wants to get a complete game."	Despite his won-lost record, Hernandez was still in the running in some circles because of his 2.39 ERA and 214 strikeouts -- three more than Weaver. But no starting pitcher has won the award in either league with fewer than 16 victories -- a distinction shared by five pitchers. So even if Hernandez won his final four starts, he would be a long shot at best.	Hernandez won 19 games last season and still finished runner-up to Kansas City's Zack Greinke, who was 16-8. David Cone was 16-5 with the Royals in 1994, Greg Maddux 16-6 with the Braves in 1994 and Brandon Webb 16-8 with the Diamondbacks in 2006. Rick Sutcliffe was 16-1 with the Cubs during the final 3½ months of the 1984 season after the Indians traded him with a 4-5 record.	Ichiro Suzuki extended his hitting streak to 13 games with a three-run homer in the eighth that chased Santana. It was his 2,215th major league hit, breaking a tie with Joe DiMaggio for 167th place all-time. It also put the two-time AL batting champ within 15 hits of reaching the 200 mark for 10th consecutive season, which would tie Pete Rose for the longest such streak in history and snap a tie with Ty Cobb for the longest streak in the AL.	Kevin Jepsen gave up a two-out RBI single in the ninth to Josh Wilson before Fernando Rodney closed it out for his ninth save in 14 chances, retiring Suzuki on a line drive to third base with two men on.	After beating Cleveland in 16 innings on Wednesday night and edging the Mariners in 14 innings in Friday night's series opener, the Angels opened the scoring in the second with Howie Kendrick's two-out RBI single after Erick Aybar grounded into a force play and stole second. The rally began with a 10-pitch leadoff walk to Matsui, whose 62 walks are three shy of his total last season with the Yankees.	Matsui's next plate appearance lasted only two pitches and resulted in his 19th homer, an opposite-field drive to left-center after Hernandez fell behind in the count.	"I felt too strong. That's what happened," said Hernandez, who was pitching on six days' rest. "I couldn't locate the corners. I just have to forget about this one and see what happens in the next one."	The Angels increased the margin to 5-0 in the fifth with three unearned runs. The first two batters reached on errors by third baseman Jose Lopez and shortstop Wilson, who mishandled a throw after Hernandez fielded Jeff Mathis' bunt and tried for the force play on Kendrick. Bobby Abreu drove in a run with a groundout and Hunter added a two-run single, after driving in only one run in his 40 previous career at-bats against Hernandez.	Hunter greeted Jamey Wright with a two-run double after Hernandez departed. But the nine-time Gold Glove outfielder lost Wilson's line drive to right field in the lights, resulting in a double right before Suzuki's sixth homer of the season.	Game notes	 Angels September callups Hank Conger and Mark Trumbo made their major league debut back-to-back in the seventh inning, striking out as pinch-hitters for Matsui and Mike Napoli. Trumbo stayed in the game at 1B, becoming the 11th player the Halos have used at that position this season. That tied a franchise record set in 1969. ... The only other matchup between Santana and Hernandez was on Aug. 13, 2008, when neither got a decision in Seattle's 12-inning 10-7 win.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- Mark Ellis was surprised to learn his hitting streak was up to a career-high 11 games.	The veteran second baseman has something else on his mind.	Ellis scored the tiebreaking run on Rajai Davis' triple in the seventh inning and Andrew Bailey struck out David Ortiz with the tying run on second to end the game, preserving the Oakland Athletics' 4-3 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Saturday night.	Oakland improved to 6-2 on its nine-game homestand. Still clinging to faint playoff hopes, the A's trailed AL West-leading Texas by 7½ games before Saturday's action.	"A lot of guys in this clubhouse have never been through this before, and to still have a chance and to have meaningful games in September is huge," Ellis said. "It's old hat for a lot of teams but for some guys around here it's not."	Ellis said he doesn't care about his hitting streak.	"I don't think I'm going to break Joe DiMaggio's record," he said.	The victory capped a big day for A's manager Bob Geren, who is set to return to Oakland's dugout next season. The team announced before the game it had exercised its option on Geren's contract for the 2011 season, ensuring him of a fifth year in charge of the club.	"At the end of the day it seemed pretty obvious to all of us," general manager Billy Beane said. "For us it's critical that we have a manager that's not only a teacher but has the patience to get through some of the growing pains a young player's going to have. Bob and the rest of the staff have certainly done that."	Oakland scored three times in the seventh and once in the eighth, erasing a 2-0 deficit and clinching its first season-series win over the Red Sox since 2006. Ellis hit a tying RBI single before coming around on Davis' hit.	John Lackey (12-10) pitched seven innings for Boston, yielding three runs and six hits. The right-hander fell to 17-5 with a 2.90 ERA in 31 career starts against Oakland.	Lackey was working on a two-hit shutout before Oakland rallied in the seventh.	"I made a couple of mistakes in the seventh; other than that I was pretty much in control," Lackey said. "In our situation you can't make too many mistakes. In the first half of the season we were hitting the ball all over the place. Right now we need to pitch well and win games."	Adrian Beltre doubled in Victor Martinez with two out in the ninth to get Boston within one but pinch-hitter Ortiz looked at a called third strike, giving Bailey his 23rd save in 26 opportunities this season.	Martinez, Beltre and Darnell McDonald had two hits apiece for Boston, which has lost six of eight and is struggling to stay in the playoff picture. The Red Sox were nine games back of the AL East-leading Yankees and 7½ back in the wild-card race entering play Saturday.	"We had a good game going but we left some runs out there early and it caught up with us late," Boston manager Terry Francona said. "The pitch to Davis was a fastball that caught too much of the plate. That was obviously the key at-bat."	Daric Barton started the Oakland seventh with a double and scored on Jack Cust's one-out single. Cust took second when left fielder Bill Hall briefly bobbled the ball and came home on Ellis' tying hit to center.	After Jeremy Hermida struck out, Davis tripled to center to make it 3-2.	Lackey, who beat the A's earlier this season despite allowing four earned runs and a season-high 12 hits, struck out six and walked none. The Red Sox have scored seven runs total in his last three games, all losses.	"Lackey's thrown a lot of good games in this ballpark when he was with Anaheim," Ellis said. "It looked like he was going to have the same outcome early in the game but we put some good at-bats together and we were able to string some together late."	Brett Anderson (5-6) scattered eight hits over seven innings for Oakland. He struck out five and walked three.	Marco Scutaro homered for Boston, which has lost eight of its last 12 road games.	Scutaro, making a rare second straight start at second base, has reached base in 20 of his last 24 games. The home run was his fourth in September and 11th overall.	Boston added another run off Anderson in the sixth when Jed Lowrie doubled and scored on Ryan Kalish's single.	Game notes	 Oakland 3B Kevin Kouzmanoff (back spasms) did not play and likely won't return to the A's lineup until next week when the team is on the road. ... Oakland RHP Joey Devine threw 20 pitches in a simulated inning and reported no pain. ... The A's have stolen 135 bases this season, their most since swiping 143 in 1992. Coco Crisp has stolen 20 consecutive bases, the longest streak by an Oakland player since Stan Javier had 28 straight.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

CLEVELAND -- Kevin Slowey is enjoying being part of another strong September run by the Minnesota Twins.	Staked to a five-run lead in the first inning, Slowey gave up two runs over five innings to earn his first win in nearly a month, 6-2 over the Cleveland Indians on Sunday.	"It's a lot of fun to be back and contributing," Slowey (12-6) said after his second start since returning from a trip to the disabled list with a strained right triceps.	"I felt a whole lot better than the last time out, but still wasn't as sharp as I would like," Slowey said. "Getting five runs early helps. You don't have to be quite as sharp."	The win was the 4,000th for the original Washington franchise, which moved to Minnesota after the 1960 season.	More significantly for manager Ron Gardenhire, the Twins took two of three in the series, have won eight of nine and have baseball's best record since the All-Star break at 39-16.	"We feel like we need to win every game in September," Gardenhire said. "We've been there before, chasing. Whether you have the lead or are trying to catch up, you want to win."	The last two years, Minnesota rallied to tie for first place in the AL Central and force a one-game playoff. The Twins lost to Chicago in 2008 and beat Detroit in 2009 in their 163rd game.	Minnesota entered play Sunday with a six-game lead and will open a three-game series in Chicago against the second-place White Sox on Tuesday.	"It will be a fun series," Gardenhire said. "It is what baseball is all about, but no more 163s. I don't want to go through that again."	A year ago, Slowey missed the fun after having season-ending wrist surgery Aug. 4.	"I just sat around and watched," he said. "It's neat to be part of it now."	Minnesota took a 5-0 lead on a walk, stolen base, four singles, error, wild pitch and sacrifice fly against Mitch Talbot (9-12) and emergency reliever Justin Masterson.	Talbot left after 14 pitches with shoulder inflammation. He walked leadoff batter Denard Span on five pitches. Manager Manny Acta and the Indians' training staff quickly went to the mound to check on the right-hander, who spent early August on the disabled list with a strained back.	Talbot yielded a single to Orlando Hudson and RBI single to Joe Mauer before being replaced by Masterson.	"Before the game, it didn't want to loosen up on me," Talbot said. "I wanted to stay out there to see if I could get it to fire for me. It just wasn't getting there."	The rookie will have an MRI on Monday.	"None of us are really worried about the MRI showing anything other than inflammation," Talbot said.	Talbot won his previous start Sept. 4 for his first win in more than two months. The rookie opened the season 8-6, but went 0-5 in 10 starts after beating the Cincinnati Reds on June 27.	Luis Valbuena, whose first-inning error led to two unearned runs, hit a two-run double in the second to get Cleveland to 5-2. Both runs were unearned after an error by Twins shortstop Alexi Casilla, who fielded a ground ball hit by Jayson Nix and threw wildly past first base.	Cleveland loaded the bases with one out in the fifth, but Slowey struck out Shin-Soo Choo and got Travis Hafner on a groundout in which second baseman Hudson ranged behind the bag and made a strong off-balance throw to first for the out.	"There's not a lot of guys who make that play," Slowey said.	Jason Kubel doubled and scored on a single up the middle by Michael Cuddyer in the sixth for a 6-2 lead.	Slowey had not won since beating Oakland on Aug. 15, when he was lifted after seven no-hit innings. He was 3-0 with a 1.57 ERA in his final four starts before being hurt in a 9-3 loss to the Los Angeles Angels on Aug. 21. He is 5-0 in six starts against Cleveland the last two years.	Masterson, moved to the bullpen after 28 starts, struck out six over seven innings -- the longest relief outing for Cleveland since Jake Westbrook worked seven on April 19, 2004, against Detroit.

DETROIT -- Thanks to an untimely walk in the eighth inning, the Baltimore Orioles ended up facing Miguel Cabrera with the bases loaded.	On the first pitch he faced, Cabrera turned a one-run deficit into a two-run lead and sent the Detroit Tigers on to a 6-2 victory Sunday.	"When you hit in the middle of the order, those are the situations you want," said Cabrera, who leads the major leagues with 116 RBIs. "He threw me a fastball, and I got a good piece of it."	With the Tigers ahead 2-1, Will Rhymes led off the eighth with a single against Mike Gonzalez (0-3) and took third on Ryan Raburn's double. Orioles manager Buck Showalter brought in David Hernandez, who got ahead 1-2 in the count to pinch-hitter Austin Jackson before loading the bases with a walk.	That foiled Showalter's plan to intentionally walk Cabrera. He already has 30 intentional walks this season, four short of Ted Williams' AL record.	"Obviously, at that point, we're hoping David can strike Jackson out so that we can walk Cabrera, but it didn't work out that way," Showalter said. "You don't want to pitch to him in a situation like that -- you've seen what he has done to every team in the major leagues this year."	Two outs later, Brandon Inge hit a two-run homer off Alfredo Simon.	"It was huge when Will got the hit to start the inning, but Miggy got us the big hit again," Inge said following his 11th home run this season. "If I were managing against him, I'm not sure I'd even pitch to him with the bases loaded. He just kills everyone.	Justin Verlander (16-8) struck out 11, matching his season high set June 16 against Washington. He allowed both runs and five hits in eight innings, and walked one.	"I felt great out there -- as good as I've felt all year," said Verlander, who is 11-3 at Comerica Park this season. "My fastball was good, and I could throw my curveball wherever I needed it -- for strikes or balls."	Phil Coke finished with a hitless ninth.	Orioles starter Chris Tillman only allowed one hit -- Inge's clean single to center in the second -- but walked a career-high six in his 6 2-3 innings. The Orioles are 23-15 since Showalter took over after a 32-73 start.	"Chris got himself into some trouble with the walks, but he kept making enough pitches to get himself out of trouble," Showalter said. "He didn't get intimidated by facing Verlander, even though he knew that meant he didn't have much margin for error out there."	Detroit, which got back to .500 at 72-72, began the game without Jackson, Johnny Damon, Magglio Ordonez, Carlos Guillen and Gerald Laird -- either due to injury or rest. The lack of offense showed, with the Tigers managing one hit in the first seven innings.	Brennan Boesch walked and stole second in the second inning, then scored as Casper Wells beat out what would have been an inning-ending double play. Baltimore went ahead 2-1 in the fifth on an RBI triple by Jake Fox, who played college ball at Michigan, and Verlander's wild pitch.	With runners at the corners in the sixth, Verlander fielded Luke Scott's grounder and threw Brian Roberts out at the plate -- the third time in a week Roberts was thrown out on the bases.	"That was as big as the walk in the eighth inning," Showalter said. "You don't get many chances against Verlander, and you can't miss one like that."	Detroit put runners on the corners in the seventh. Gonzalez relieved, and Alex Avila grounded out.	Game notes	 As soon as the game ended, the Tigers crowded around the clubhouse televisions to watch the end of the Lions' controversial 19-14 loss to the Bears, with several reacting angrily to the call that negated what appeared to be a winning touchdown for Calvin Johnson. The Lions and Tigers, who play in adjoining stadiums, haven't won on the same day since Sept. 30, 2007. ... Boesch stole two bases in a game for the first time and walked three times for the third time in his rookie season. Two of the three came in day games against Baltimore at Comerica Park. ... Tillman pitched a no-hitter on April 28 for Triple-A Norfolk. ... Cabrera has 31 RBIs in 35 games against the AL East this season, including 18 doubles and 11 homers.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

TORONTO -- Adam Lind thought he'd hit a game-winning home run. Then he wasn't so sure.	Turns out he was right the first time.	Lind hit a two-run drive off Rafael Soriano in the ninth inning Sunday, giving the Toronto Blue Jays a 5-4 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays.	As the ball sailed toward the right-field corner, Lind wasn't sure his low drive had enough to clear the fence.	"When I hit it, I thought it was a home run for sure," Lind said. "Then I saw the topspin start to take over, and I didn't think it was going to make it, but it did. I saw it barely clear the fence, and it was awesome."	It was the second game-ending homer for Lind, who connected the last time Toronto won in that fashion, a 10th-inning home run that beat Seattle on Sept. 26 last year.	With Toronto trailing 4-3, Aaron Hill led off the ninth with a single off Soriano (2-2), who had converted his previous 19 save chances since July 20. After falling behind in the count 0-2, Lind lined his 22nd home run of the season, ending the Blue Jays' four-game losing streak.	"He has been absolutely brilliant for us all year, and they got him today," Rays manager Joe Maddon said.	Toronto leads the majors with 224 homers, including a big league-high 128 at home. The Blue Jays have connected in a season-high 14 consecutive games, hitting 29 homers in that stretch.	"If you make a mistake, even with two strikes, it can go far," Maddon said.	Tampa Bay, which remains a half-game behind the AL East-leading New York Yankees, outhit the Blue Jays 8-5 but lost for the fifth time in eight games. It was the third blown save in 45 chances for Soriano.	Soriano said he wasn't feeling 100 percent after sleeping poorly but said he never considered asking for the day off.	"To me, that's not an excuse," Soriano said. "I threw a good pitch, and I don't know how he hit it like that. You know, bad day. You can't win every single day. I want to, but you can't."	It's the first time this season Soriano surrendered a walkoff hit.	"Hopefully that's the last one," Rays outfielder Carl Crawford said.	Tampa Bay won't have long to dwell on the defeat. The Rays begin a three-game series at home to the Yankees on Monday night, with 17-game winner David Price starting against 19-game winner CC Sabathia.	"Every series from here on out is a big deal, until we clinch," Crawford said. "When we play the Yankees tomorrow, it's probably going to have that playoff atmosphere."	B.J. Upton's ninth-inning sacrifice fly off Kevin Gregg (2-5) had put Tampa Bay ahead following Brad Hawpe's one-out walk and Desmond Jennings' hit-and-run single.	Rays starter Jeff Niemann allowed three runs, two hits and four walks in five innings. He is 0-3 with a 15.6 ERA in four starts since missing 20 games in August because of a strained right shoulder.	Toronto's Shaun Marcum gave up three runs and six hits in six innings.	Held hitless through the first three innings, the Rays went ahead in the fourth on doubles by Evan Longoria and Ben Zobrist.	Toronto took a 3-1 lead in the bottom half after loading the bases. Hill hit a bouncer toward the mound and Niemann's flip to catcher Dioner Navarro sailed high as two runs scored.	"He just made a bad flip, no question," Maddon said. "He had more time than he thought."	John Buck capped the rally with a sacrifice fly.	Zobrist had an RBI double in the sixth and Marcum threw a run-scoring wild pitch.	Game notes	 Toronto RHP Kyle Drabek will be promoted from Double-A New Hampshire on Wednesday to make his major league debut against Baltimore. Drabek, who went 14-9 this season, is a son of former NL Cy Young Award winner Doug Drabek. ... Rays 1B Carlos Pena was held out of the starting lineup. ... Tampa Bay leads the majors with 159 stolen bases. ... Toronto also homered in 14 consecutive games in 2002. ... Longoria's double in the fourth was his 44th this season, matching his career-high.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

CINCINNATI -- The Cincinnati Reds are finding that winning record more elusive than ever.	The NL Central leaders were one strike from their 82nd victory Sunday, which would have clinched their first winning season in 10 years, but closer Francisco Cordero couldn't nail it down. Andrew McCutchen hit a three-run double in the ninth inning and the Pittsburgh Pirates stunned Cincinnati 3-1.	"I felt pretty good," said Cordero, whose blown save was his second of the three-game series. "I threw him a slider, but he got the best part of his bat on it. I'm not pitching my best right now. It's a real disappointment."	The Pirates, last in the division, loaded the bases with one out against Cordero (6-5), but pinch-hitter Jose Tabata grounded into a forceout at the plate. McCutchen then fell behind in the count 1-2 before pulling a line drive into the left-field corner.	"When I got down 0-2, I was thinking that I'd do anything I can to get on base," McCutchen said. "I knew what he threw. I've faced him a few times. All the pitches were sliders. After you've seen it a few times, you recognize it out of his hand. He left it up and I got the good part of the bat on it.	"We battled the whole game. We got to their bullpen and pretty much took advantage."	Pirates manager John Russell pointed out that the rally was Pittsburgh's third of the three-game series.	"To do some of the things we've done this series is a good sign," he said. "I know we lost the first two games, but the guys have competed well. That whole inning, guys put together great at-bats. We got to Cordero twice this series. That's not easy to do."	Cordero also gave up a lead Friday in a game the Reds ended up winning 4-3 in 12 innings. Nick Masset inherited a 3-0 lead and gave up four in the eighth on Saturday in a game the Reds won 5-4 in 10 innings.	Cincinnati manager Dusty Baker thought nobody felt worse than Cordero.	"It's terrible for Coco," Baker said. "We need him. He's our closer. Nobody else is ready. People are hollering for somebody else, but what if you bring somebody in and he doesn't do the job? The Phillies won a World Series with Brad Lidge, and he blew several [saves]."	Chan Ho Park (1-1) worked a hitless eighth inning for the win. Joel Hanrahan loaded the bases with two outs in the ninth before striking out Chris Heisey for his fifth save.	The Reds, who have a six-game lead over second-place St. Louis, are trying to secure their first season of .500 or better since 2000, when they were 85-77 in Jack McKeon's last season as manager.	Cincinnati right-hander Johnny Cueto, who was 1/3 in his previous five starts, gave up a two-out single to Neil Walker in the first inning and didn't allow another hit until Pedro Alvarez's single leading off the seventh.	Cueto didn't yield more than one baserunner in any inning until the seventh, when he gave up two hits before striking out Ronny Cedeno to end the threat. That left Cueto with seven strikeouts, one in each inning, and just two walks.	Pittsburgh left-hander Brian Burres was nearly as effective, giving up four hits and one walk with six strikeouts in seven innings.	Joey Votto, who hit a game-ending homer Saturday, drove in the first run Sunday, teaming up with Orlando Cabrera on back-to-back doubles to start the fourth inning. Votto pushed his season total to 102 RBIs.	Votto moved into a tie with St. Louis slugger Albert Pujols for the NL RBI lead with 102. The Cardinals were scheduled to play at Atlanta later Sunday.	Walker extended his hitting streak to 18 games by beating out a slow chopper to third in the first inning. His streak is the longest by a Pittsburgh rookie since Rennie Stennett's 18-game streak in 1971.	Game notes	 Pete Rose received a standing ovation when he and members of his family were shown on the video board sitting in a luxury box. Rose, banned from baseball in 1989 for betting on games, was honored Saturday on the 25th anniversary of him becoming the career hits leader. He held up a cardboard sign bearing the hastily written message, "Reds Fans R The Greatest." ... Cincinnati OF Jay Bruce, sidelined since Aug. 30 with pain in his right side, could start Tuesday, Baker said. Bruce hit five homers in his last four games before the injury.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

NEW YORK -- Roy Oswalt considers himself a cerebral pitcher. He prides himself on taking detailed notes on hitters, studying hours of game film and putting together a comprehensive plan of attack before he ever steps on the mound.	All that's left after that is to make the pitches.	Relying on what he learned from watching the Mets earlier in the series, Oswalt set down New York in quick fashion Sunday. He yielded only four hits in his second complete game this season, as the Philadelphia Phillies won 3-0 in a tidy 2 hours, 15 minutes.	"Pretty much fastball and changeup most of the day, and started to add some curveballs late so they wouldn't start sitting on pitches," Oswalt said. "It worked."	Oswalt needed 113 pitches for his 20th career complete game. He struck out six, allowed only one walk (to the pitcher) and didn't allow a runner to reach second base.	In fact, the only time he was in trouble came in the ninth inning, and only because Jose Reyes lined a pitch off one of Oswalt's legs. Trainers came out to check on Oswalt and he threw a warmup pitch before staying in the game -- the Phillies bullpen barely stirred -- and promptly started a 1-6-3 double play. Oswalt ended the game a minute later by striking out Carlos Beltran.	David Wright was waiting on deck, though he probably wanted no part of Oswalt again. He'd already struck out in each of his first three tries.	"He was definitely on his game. He can throw any pitch at any time," said Josh Thole, who also went 0 for 3. "You know any time you face a guy like that, you're in for a rough time. Except for one pitch, everything he threw me was at my knees or below."	Raul Ibanez hit a solo homer off Jon Niese (9-8), and Chase Utley and Ryan Howard also drove in runs to provide the only offense for the Phillies. They moved one game ahead of Atlanta in the NL East by winning for the fifth time in six games.	"Today was a big game for us," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said. "If we finish up and win series the rest of the year, we'll be good. That'll put us in a very good spot."	Oswalt (12-13) had the lead before he even took the hill.	Shane Victorino led off with a single, Placido Polanco drew a walk and Utley singled to right to make it 1-0 in the first. Philadelphia added another run in the third when Polanco doubled and Howard hit a two-out single to left, and Ibanez homered to straightaway center in the seventh.	Even that much offense had to make Niese a bit jealous.	The closest the Mets got to scoring was first base -- Angel Pagan was cut down trying to steal second in the first inning, and Niese was erased before reaching second on fielder's choice groundouts by Reyes in the third and sixth innings.	Niese wound up allowing eight hits and a pair of walks in seven innings, losing for the third time in his last four starts at Citi Field. He hasn't won at home since July 27.	"I thought he pitched extremely well. I thought he had good stuff, good life on his pitches," Mets manager Jerry Manuel said. "I thought some extra rest helped him."	Niese pitched especially well during the middle innings and gave the Mets a chance, but Oswalt by now is used to making due with little run support. He only gets about three runs per game, the fourth-lowest average of any starting pitcher in the major leagues this season.	Much of that had to do with the Houston Astros' anemic offense earlier in the year, but this was still the third time the Phillies have supplied him with three runs or fewer. Philadelphia has won each of those starts, though, and hasn't lost with Oswalt on the mound since he dropped his debut with the defending NL champions on July 30.	"I feel like I got a new life coming over here," Oswalt said in his subtle Mississippi drawl. "I've been out of playoff contention for about five years. Coming here, these guys have been there twice. They've got a ring and I don't."	Game notes	 SS Jimmy Rollins (tight right hamstring) returned to Philadelphia for an MRI exam on Monday. Charlie Manuel still considers him day to day. ... Beltran (left knee tendinitis) was back in the starting lineup after sitting out Saturday. ...

WASHINGTON -- Mike Stanton is a streaky hitter, and the Florida Marlins are happy to ride his power surges.	Stanton homered twice and drove in three runs to lead the Marlins over the Washington Nationals 6-5 Sunday for a three-game sweep.	"You can't really predict home runs, but that's what I'm expecting," said Stanton, who homered five times as the Marlins went 4-3 on a seven-game trip. "It's not like I'm going to say I'm hitting 45, 40 home runs every year, but if I just relax and have good at-bats for a full season, who knows how many I hit?"	At Double-A Jacksonville and the Marlins, the 20-year-old Stanton has homered a combined 41 times in 133 games. But he also slumped through an 0-for-31 streak in late August.	Stanton homered to left off Jordan Zimmermann (0-1) leading off the second, then hit a two-run drive in the third for 5-2 lead.	"He's going to continue to get better as he gets older and more at-bats," teammate Dan Uggla said. "It's kind of mind-boggling to see what he's doing at the age of 20. If we had brought him up at the beginning of the year, I think he could very easily have hit 30 or 35 -- if not more than that."	Florida won 10 of its last 11 games against Washington to win the season series 13-5. The last-place Nationals have lost five in a row overall, falling a season-high 23 games under .500 at 60-83.	That caused Washington manager Jim Riggleman to close his clubhouse for almost a half-hour after the game so that he and coaches could speak to the Nationals about their effort.	"If anybody in the room thought that was acceptable, they need to be made aware that we certainly don't think it's acceptable," Riggleman said. "I think the losing wears on you, but it's a 162-game schedule. It's a nine-inning ballgame. That's what you sign up for. That's what you give."	Washington second baseman Adam Kennedy said the unconventionally delivered message was necessary.	"When you're in a situation like us and you have sloppy games, it looks twice as bad as it is. We don't have the luxury to go out there and take games, days off," Kennedy said. "We need to play clean baseball in order to win, in order for us to look good."	Chris Volstad, bidding to become the first Marlins pitcher to go 5-0 against an opponent in one season, allowed five runs -- four earned -- eight hits and three walks in 4 2/3 innings. He is to start a six-game suspension Monday, discipline assessed for his role in a brawl with Washington on Sept. 1.	"I felt pretty good today," Volstad said. "Eight singles -- that's what they got. It wasn't like they were really ripping the ball."	Brian Sanches (1-2) won in relief, striking out four in 1 2/3 innings, and Clay Hensley got three outs for his third save in six chances, finishing 4 1/3 hitless innings for Marlins' relievers.	"I was confident the bullpen would keep us in the game, and they shut everything down," Marlins manager Edwin Rodriguez said.	Making his fourth start since returning from elbow ligament replacement surgery in August last year, Zimmermann received his first major league decision since a loss to the Chicago Cubs on July 18, 2009. He allowed five runs -- four earned -- five hits and three walks in three innings, throwing 80 pitches.	Ivan Rodriguez had three RBIs for the Nationals.	Florida took a 3-0 lead in the second on Stanton's homer, Emilio Bonifacio's run-scoring infield hit and an error Zimmermann on an errant pickoff throw that led to a run.	Rodriguez hit a two-run single in the bottom half. After Stanton's second homer, Ryan Zimmerman's RBI single cut Washington's deficit to 5-3 in the third. Uggla drove in a run with a fourth-inning groundout, and Rodriguez had an RBI grounder in the bottom half. Roger Bernadina's RBI single chased Volstad in the fifth.	Game notes	 When Florida LF Logan Morrison walked in the second, it marked the 32nd straight game he has reached base with a hit, walk or hit by pitch. ... Marlins RHP Josh Johnson did not throw in the bullpen on Sunday and was ruled out of his scheduled start on Wednesday because of shoulder and back tightness. Manager Edwin Rodriguez said the team was leaning toward not having Johnson pitch again this season. A decision could be made Monday. "If there's any indication that he's not getting any better or that he's getting worse, it's my opinion that we should shut him down," Rodriguez said. ... Ron Menchine, the Washington Senators radio broadcaster who called the team's final game in D.C. in 1971 and criticized then-owner Bob Short for his plans to move to Texas, died Saturday. He was 76.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

CHICAGO -- Paul Konerko and the White Sox are taking a carefree attitude into their three-game series against the division-leading Minnesota Twins.	"We've got nothing to lose," Konerko said. "There's no pressure on us and we shouldn't play with any pressure ... It's really the Twins' to lose."	Konerko hit a pair of two-run homers and an RBI single in Chicago's come-from-behind 12-6 win over the Kansas City Royals on Sunday.	The win helped the White Sox keep pace in the Central, six game back of the Twins. The teams play three games in Chicago beginning Tuesday.	"We know it's uphill," Konerko said of the six-game deficit. "You can't sweep unless you win the first one. [But] if we can win two out of three at least and put a little more heat on them, there's still some games left after that. But a sweep would be nice."	Chicago pinch-hitter Andruw Jones had the other big hit, a grand slam in the sixth inning.	"The way they were swinging [early] the question was whether we would hold them," Konerko said. "Starting last night they were swinging the bats great ... it had that feel it was going to be a slugfest."	Kansas City led 6-0 after just one-half inning, but Chicago chipped away with two runs apiece in the first, third and fourth innings before chasing Royals starter Sean O'Sullivan, who gave up five runs.	"You've got a young kid on the mound and a young offense," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "It never turns out the way you want it to because the pitcher thinks he has room to make mistakes, the offense thinks they've scored some runs."	Reliever Sergio Santos (2-0) pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings for the win, striking out three. Philip Humber (1-1) tossed 2 1/3 innings and gave up four runs and five hits.	The Royals sent nine batters to the plate in the first, scoring six runs on starting pitcher Lucas Harrell thanks pair of three-run home runs each from Billy Butler and Brayan Pena.	Butler's drive was his 12th of the season while Pena's was his first since Sept. 26, 2009, against Minnesota.	Konerko connected for his 35th homer of the season in the bottom half. Konerko hit his second two-run shot in the third, this time sending a 1-2 pitch on a towering fly to left field. He now has 27 career multihomer games, the last coming on June 2 against Texas.	Chicago tied the game with a pair of fourth-inning runs. Juan Pierre had a sacrifice fly while Alexei Ramirez scored from third on a passed ball with Konerko at the plate.	Harrell settled down after the first and eventually pitched 3 1/3 innings. He gave up six earned runs on nine hits, walked three and struck out one.	In the decisive sixth, the White Sox had runners on first and third when Konerko delivered a single that brought home Omar Vizquel. Humber then hit Manny Ramiez with a pitch to load the bases.	Dusty Hughes entered in relief and walked A.J. Pierzynski to score Alex Rios for an 8-6 lead.	Jones, pinch-hitting for Mark Teahen, hit his fifth career slam on a 1-2 pitch to left-center.	Royals second baseman Chris Getz left the game with a mild concussion after being hit in the head on a throw from Pierzynski, the catcher, while running to second in the fifth inning. The Royals said he'd be evaluated on Monday.	Game notes	 Konerko's two home runs gave him 362 for his career. He moved ahead of Joe DiMaggio for 69th on the all-time list. ... Pierre picked up the 514th stolen base of his career in the bottom of the first inning.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

HOUSTON -- Hunter Pence is spreading the credit around for his success this season.	Pence had his team-leading 24th homer among his three hits and the Houston Astros beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 7-4 Sunday.	Pence drove in a pair of runs and has a career-high 84 RBIs with three weeks left in his fourth season. He drove in 83 runs in 2008.	"There has been good hitting in front of me, [Michael] Bourn and [Jeff] Keppinger, and I'm getting more opportunities by hitting in the No. 3 spot," Pence said. "I am grateful for the opportunity and feel good that it's going the way it is."	Carlos Lee hit his 21st homer of the season as the Astros earned a split of the four-game series against the Dodgers. Lee, Angel Sanchez, Brett Wallace and Jason Castro each had two hits for the Astros, who have won 16 of their last 22 games at Minute Maid Park.	In his last five starts, Wallace has two double, two homers and four RBI.	"Hunter really set the pace with that homer in the first inning," said Wallace, who recorded his first multi-RBI game. "He's a guy that really brings a lot of energy for us."	Gustavo Chacin (2-2) wriggled out of a bases-loaded jam with two outs in the fifth to keep the score tied 4-all. He and five other relievers combined for 4 1/3 innings of two-hit ball.	Rookie Fernando Abad worked 1 2/3 hitless innings. Brandon Lyon pitched a hitless ninth to earn his 15 save.	Chacin enticed a harmless fly out to left by Gibbons, just one inning after the hot-hitting lefty hit a 390-foot homer to the upper deck in right.	"He's has been swinging the bat very good the last couple of games," Chacin said. "He has been hitting the ball very good down the right field line, so we have been talking about staying away from him."	The Astros scored twice against reliever Ramon Troncoso (1-3) in the fifth inning to take the lead for good. Wallace led off with a double and scored one out later on a bloop double to center field by Castro. Pinch-hitter Geoff Blum then followed with an RBI double to make it 6-4.	"It was nice to come back with some big hits to take the lead," Astros manager Brad Mills said. "We got a big hit early from Hunter Pence and then were able to take advantage of an error. That was nice."	The Astros scored four runs against Dodgers starter Carlos Monasterios in the first inning. After Bourn led off the game with a single, Pence made it 2-0 with his homer. On a full-count pitch, Monasterios left a slider up and Pence drilled it off the facade above the wall in left for a 390-foot home run.	Lee followed with a single, but it looked like the rookie pitcher would escape further damage when he got Matt Downs to hit a grounder to short. But instead of turning a double play, Dodgers shortstop Chin-Lung Hu threw the ball into right field leaving Lee and Downs on second and third.	Wallace drove in both with a single to right.	Monasterios didn't make it out of the second inning and was replaced by Jeff Weaver after walking two of the first three batters he faced. The 24-year old rookie gave up five hits, four runs (three earned) while striking out two and walking two.	Dodgers manager Joe Torre said Monasterios still "needs to gain more confidence from more experience."	"When we send him out there, we hope for the best," Torre added. "Sometimes, when he struggles early on, he doesn't know how to fix it."	Los Angeles got back in the game with a four-run fourth inning. Trent Oeltjen led off the inning with the Dodgers' first hit of the game, and Andre Ethier reached with an infield hit one out later. Gibbons made it 4-3 with his home run.	Gibbons is now hitting .500 (7-for-14) with runners in scoring position since being recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque on Aug. 8.	James Loney followed with a triple to the gap in right center, and Russ Mitchell collected the first RBI of his career with a sacrifice fly to center to tie the game.	Game notes	 Astros rookie third baseman Chris Johnson missed his second straight game with a lower back injury. Johnson is second among NL rookies in batting at .319. Since the All-Star break, Johnson is sixth overall in the NL in hitting at .333 (min. 150 AB). ... Prior to Sunday's game, the Astros activated RHP Felipe Paulino from the 60-day disabled list. He missed the last three months with shoulder tendinitis. ... Dodgers infielder John Lindsey recorded his first major league hit in the fifth inning. Pinch-hitting for relief pitcher Ronald Belisario, Lindsey lined a single to left. Lindsey spent the first 16 years of his career in the minors and was recently called up for the first time. He made his first career start Saturday and went 0-for-3 at the plate.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

MILWAUKEE -- Yovani Gallardo used his arm and bat to stop the Chicago Cubs.	Gallardo pitched four-hit ball for seven innings and doubled and scored on Ryan Braun's two-base hit in the fifth, lifting the Milwaukee Brewers to a 2-0 victory over the Cubs on Sunday.	Gallardo won for the first time since beating Houston on Aug. 8, a span of seven starts. He allowed three singles and a double while walking three and striking out six.	He was making his 10th start since coming off the 15-day disabled list with a left oblique strain. Coming in he was 3-3 in that span, including three no-decisions. He had one of his better outings in his last start, a no-decision in an 8-6 loss to St. Louis last Monday. He went seven innings, allowing two runs on four hits.	Gallardo (12-7) said that he simply wasn't locating the fast ball before the game against the Cardinals. Now, he was.	"It's just the ball was up in the zone," Gallardo said of earlier troubles. "The last two I was able to keep the ball down. These are big league hitters. You leave the ball up, it's gonna get hit."	The Brewers 24-year-old right-hander led off the fifth with a double, then scored two outs later when Braun blooped an opposite-field, broken-bat double down the first-base line.	The Cubs had held their opponents scoreless for 25 innings before Braun's hit, a streak that started Sept. 8 against Houston.	Braun came in 1-for-8 in the series against the Cubs, but reached base three times on two singles and shortstop Starlin Castro's throwing error.	"Our pitchers have really thrown the ball well for the last few weeks," Braun said. "It's nice to finally pick somebody up. Yovani threw the ball great. Fortunately, his bat was in the lineup for us."	Cubs manager Mike Quade said there is no margin for error in a close game.	"Often times, something like that will happen. It's unfortunate, but that's just one run," he said. "So, we needed to find a way to score a couple."	The Cubs didn't find that way as Kameron Loe and closer John Axford protected the shutout.	Loe retired the first two batters in the eighth, but was lifted for Axford after giving up Xavier Nady's single. Axford got Tyler Colvin to fly out to the warning track in center on the first pitch.	Axford stayed on and pitched the ninth for his 21st save in 23 chances, finishing the five-hitter and Brewers' sixth shutout.	Casey McGehee homered in the eighth after the Brewers scored their first run of the three-game series. He hit the first pitch from reliever Thomas Diamond into the Brewers' bullpen in left for his 21st home run. He also snared a hard grounder off the bat of pinch-hitter Aramis Ramirez in the ninth.	Casey Coleman (1-2), the club's 15th round pick in the 2008 June draft took the loss in his fifth career start after relieving in his first four games.	He allowed one run and five hits, struck out three and walked three as he tried to duplicate the Cubs' dominance the previous two games.	On Friday, Carlos Zambrano was outstanding in a 4-0 victory. Ryan Dempster was just as dominant in a 1-0 win Saturday that was the 100th of his career. Carlos Marmol finished each game for saves.	The Brewers' offense scratched out just three hits in each loss after producing 20 runs on 30 hits to take two of three from St. Louis as the six-game homestand began.	Quade said that Coleman did a fantastic job despite being matched up against Gallardo.	"The kid battled today, but Gallardo, Gallardo's tough. You've got to give him his due," Quade said.	Coleman showed some veteran composure weathering Castros' throwing error, his 25th, that set up a bases-loaded jam in the third.	Corey Hart walked before Castro bobbled Braun's two-out grounder and then threw wide of first. With Hart at third and Braun at second, Coleman intentionally walked Prince Fielder and then got McGehee to hit into a fielder's choice.	Game notes	 RHP Carlos Silva will not make his scheduled start Tuesday against the Cardinals at St. Louis due to a right elbow strain. Quade said Silva came in during batting practice and told them about the injury. Silva will return to Chicago to be examined Monday. RHP Jeff Samardzija will make start instead. ... Quade said that Ramirez, who missed five consecutive games with a sore right quad, should be ready Monday as the Cubs face the Cardinals. ... With a look toward next season, Macha said that RHP Mark Rogers, the team's top pick in the 2004 first-year player draft, would get a start against the Florida Marlins during the final homestand. ... Fielder's 95 walks leads the NL.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- Cliff Lee was steaming.	He thought he'd thrown strike three to Derek Jeter, not ball four. He knew the walk meant he was coming out of the game. So, off he stomped -- not even bothering to savor having allowed a mere two hits over eight-plus innings in his first start since getting an injection in his back.	Then Neftali Feliz struck out the side and Lee's mood brightened. He leaped over the dugout railing with a big smile to celebrate a 4-1 victory over the New York Yankees on Sunday that wrapped up a sweep in a series between division leaders and potential first-round playoff foes.	"Every time he has the ball, he doesn't expect to be anything less than that, and we don't really expect it out of him," said Ian Kinsler, who turned a walk into Texas' first run. "It's just nice having him back on the field and healthy."	Lee (11-8) looked like the ace the Rangers expected when they gave up a top prospect for what could be a half-season rental, and nothing like the guy who had a 9.00 ERA over his last four starts.	He opened the game by walking Jeter, then wiped him out by getting speedy Curtis Granderson to hit into a double play. He retired the next 14 batters, too. With one out in the sixth, the Yankees hadn't gotten the ball out of the infield.	Eduardo Nunez broke up the no-hit bid with a line drive to center field, then scored on a single by Jeter. Lee recovered, though, retiring seven in a row before opening the ninth inning with the leadoff walk to Jeter that prompted a rare display of emotion from a guy who hates to come out of any game, especially against the Yankees.	"He came after us like he always does," said New York's Jorge Posada, who went 0-for-3. "He's a good pitcher who comes after you and puts the ball where he wants to."	Lee said his back "felt fine, not restricting at all." Rather having a particular pitch working, it was his location -- low and on the corners. He was especially glad to help the AL West leaders inch closer to their first division title since 1999. This was their fifth straight win since losing five in a row.	"Hopefully we can keep this momentum," he said.	The Yankees lost for the sixth time in seven games and were swept in a three-game series for the first time since July 2009 at Anaheim. They kept a half-game lead in the AL East because second-place Tampa Bay lost 5-4 to Toronto. The Yankees play a three-game series at the Rays starting Monday night.	"I feel good about this team," manager Joe Girardi said. "We've worked hard to where we are, we still have some baseball left, and I firmly believe we'll play well down the stretch. ... We lost three tough games, that's the bottom line. We had a chance to win two of them. It's going to happen during a season."	Yankees starter Dustin Moseley (4-3) was just as stingy as Lee during his first two times through the order but couldn't keep it going.	Given a 1-0 lead in the sixth, he allowed a run in the bottom of the inning without a hit -- a walk by Elvis Andrus, a steal, a fly ball and a fielder's choice in which Andrus beat a throw to the plate. The Rangers broke it open with three runs in the seventh, starting with Kinsler walking, moving to third on a pair of fly balls, then scoring on Julio Borbon's surprise bunt and a headfirst slide into first that barely beat Moseley to the bag.	"I knew I had a pretty good chance of seeing something off-speed, which is a really good pitch to bunt and bring with you," said Borbon, a left-handed hitter who dragged the ball down the first-base line.	The pitching duel was quite a finish to a tight, tense series.	Texas Rangers won the opener 6-5 in 13 innings, then won 7-6 Saturday night when Yankees closer Mariano Rivera hit a batter with the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth. The series drew 137,396 fans, second-most for a three-game series in Rangers history.	The first two games were taxing for everyone as they lasted a combined 9-plus hours while burning through 33 pitchers. So both starters went out knowing they had to soak up innings.	Moseley lasted 6 2/3 innings, getting tagged for four runs on five hits. He walked two and struck out one. Both walks turned into runs.	"I would have loved to match Cliff the whole way, but the leadoff walks hurt me," Moseley said.	Lee threw 109 pitches, striking out five. Feliz struck out the final three batters for his 36th save in 39 chances, leaving him one shy of the major league saves record for a rookie.	Game notes	 Yankees RF Nick Swisher was a late scratch because of a bruised left knee. He says it's not healing and doesn't know if he'll be able to play against the Rays. "The injury is starting to affect other parts of my body and I have to compensate to move," he said. ... Lee had only seven unintentional walks in 11 previous starts for Texas. ... Andrus reached 30 steals for a second straight year, the first Rangers player to do so since Tom Goodwin in 1998-99.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

DENVER -- Jason Giambi came off the bench and became the latest late-inning star for the surging Colorado Rockies.	Giambi connected for a pinch-hit, two-run homer with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning and Colorado beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 4-2 on Sunday to extend its winning streak to 10 games.	"Streaks likes this, you win in all kinds of different ways," Rockies manager Jim Tracy said.	Colorado's winning streak is the longest in the NL this season and one game short of the major league best held by the Chicago White Sox and Texas Rangers.	The Rockies pulled within 1 1/2 games of first place in the NL West. San Diego and San Francisco are tied atop the division after the Giants beat the Padres 6-1 on Sunday behind Tim Lincecum.	San Diego comes into Coors Field for a three-game series starting Monday night. With a few more wins and some help from the Los Angeles Dodgers, who play the Giants beginning on Tuesday, the Rockies could soon move into first place.	"That's been a goal and now we've got a shot to do it," shortstop Troy Tulowitzki said.	Jonathan Herrera started the winning rally when he reached on an error by second baseman Kelly Johnson. Clint Barmes struck out for the second out before Giambi, who was 0 for 16 against Arizona this year, drove a 1-1 pitch from Sam Demel (1-1) to center for his sixth homer of the season.	"I got a pitch I could handle and I hit it out of the ballpark," Giambi said. "I was hoping to take a good at-bat and get one in the gap because we've got Herrera at first who could score. I was lucky enough to get it up in the air."	The Rockies didn't know it was gone until center fielder Chris Young stopped running.	"Coors Field, anything's possible," Demel said. "He caught it well, got out in front, popped it up in the air and it got out of here."	Huston Street (3-4) pitched a perfect ninth for the win.	Arizona starter Ian Kennedy was masterful for six scoreless innings, giving up just two hits, striking out six and walking three. After allowing a two-out single to Tulowitzki in the first and walking Todd Helton, Kennedy retired the next 15 batters before yielding a two-out double to Carlos Gonzalez in the sixth.	Kennedy also had three of the Diamondbacks' eight hits, but his potent bat caused him to leave after throwing only 82 pitches due to a cramp in his right calf that flared up while he was running the bases in the sixth.	"I wanted to go back out there [for the seventh] because I knew my pitch count was low and my arm felt good," he said. "I was on base too much, I guess. That's usually not my problem."	Still, the right-hander was in line for his sixth win in his last seven starts when, for the second straight game, the Rockies rallied. Helton drew a leadoff walk from Blaine Boyer in the seventh and two outs later Miguel Olivo walked. Pinch-hitter Ryan Spilborghs hit a bloop double off the outstretched glove of shortstop Stephen Drew in shallow left field to drive in both runners and tie the score at 2.	"Two four-pitch walks," Arizona manager Kirk Gibson said. "You can't do that to Colorado. Both scored. That's not good baseball."	The Diamondbacks took the lead in the third with the help of an error by Colorado starter Jhoulys Chacin. Kennedy led off with a single and, after Drew struck out, Chacin threw Young's potential double-play grounder into center field to put runners at the corners.	Johnson walked to load the bases, Adam LaRoche followed with a sacrifice fly and Miguel Montero doubled in Young to make it 2-0.	Chacin loaded the bases again in the fourth but got Johnson to ground out, ending the inning. Chacin gave up two unearned runs in four innings, struck out four and walked four.	The Rockies had a chance to score first when they loaded the bases in the first, but Melvin Mora grounded out to end the threat.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- If the Los Angeles Angels had played as well against the rest of the American League as they have against the Seattle Mariners -- and avoided a couple of devastating injuries -- perhaps they'd be in the hunt for a fourth straight division title.	Dan Haren held Seattle to three singles over seven innings, Mike Napoli homered and the Angels scored another run on a catcher's interference call with the bases loaded in a 3-0 victory over the Mariners on Sunday.	The Angels, who are in third place in the AL West after winning three straight division titles, completed a three-game sweep and won the season series 14-5. It's the fifth straight year in which they reached double digits in victories against the Mariners, the longest such streak in the franchise's 50-year history.	"We need to obviously put wins on the board and put ourselves in a position where we have an opportunity to gain ground when we play some of the teams ahead of us and make a difference," said manager Mike Scioscia, whose team trails Texas by 10 games with 19 to play. "We're putting together a little streak now, and obviously it has to continue."	Haren (3-4) struck out six, walked three and did not allow a hit after Russell Branyan's leadoff single in the fourth. Seattle had only three baserunners after that against the left-hander, two on walks and another on a throwing error by Napoli when he fielded Franklin Gutierrez's grounder to first base and tried to get a force at second on Branyan.	"I'm definitely happy with the way I've been throwing the ball overall the last few weeks, and I'm happy that we finally won a game that I pitched -- because we've only won a few," said Haren, who has a 3.04 ERA in 10 starts since the Angels obtained him in a July 25 trade that sent Joe Saunders to the Arizona Diamondbacks.	Haren escaped a bases-loaded jam in the fourth when he got Bard to fly out to center field. Bard's only other at-bat with the bases loaded this season was at Cleveland on Aug. 14, when he hit his first career grand slam.	"It was a split that was down. He got good wood on it, actually, but it was in a good location. So there wasn't much he could do with it," Haren said. "That was really the turning point of the game." 	Rookie Jordan Walden pitched the eighth inning and Fernando Rodney got three outs for his 10th save in 15 chances.	Jason Vargas (9-10) lost his fifth straight start, allowing two runs -- one earned -- and seven hits over seven innings with four strikeouts. The left-hander was 1-2 with a 2.06 ERA in his five starts against the Angels this season.	This was the 18th time in Vargas' 28 starts this season that the Mariners scored fewer than three runs while he was in the game.	"It's been pretty frustrating, the way we've played when he's been out there," batterymate Josh Bard said. "It's been kind of the same old story all year. He's been throwing great every time he's taken the ball. Today it was his command and change of speeds. He's a guy we want to get out there as much as we can."	The Angels got an unearned run in the first when Bard was called for catcher's interference with the bases loaded and Hideki Matsui at the plate. Erick Aybar and Howie Kendrick opened the inning with bunt singles to the left of the mound on Vargas' second and third pitches of the game.	It was the second time this season that Matsui got an RBI after his bat made contact with a catcher's glove with the bases loaded. It also occurred against Seattle's backstop Eliezer Alfonzo on May 30 at Angel Stadium.	"He was fooled by the pitch and he hit my glove, but I've got to find a way to stay back. So I'll take responsibility," Bard said.	Juan Rivera drove in the Angels' second run with a bloop single in the sixth after a double by Napoli, who hit his 24th homer in the eighth against Ryan Rowland-Smith.	The home runs hasn't translated into a great deal of RBIs, however -- just 65. Napoli has only 19 hits in 99 at-bats with runners in scoring position, and just 3-for-13 with the bases loaded.	"Mike is really driving the ball well, but his situational hitting is something that has probably hampered his production," Scioscia said.	Game notes	 Any combination of five Los Angeles wins and/or Seattle losses would mathematically clinch the Mariners' second straight last-place finish and sixth in eight seasons. ... The Mariners return to Safeco Field Monday night against Boston trying to snap a streak of 15 straight home games with three runs or less. It's the longest such streak since a 15-game stretch by the 1954 Baltimore Orioles at Memorial Stadium. ... The Angels have to go no worse than 6-13 the rest of the way to avoid tying the team's worst record in Scioscia's 10 previous seasons as manager. The 2001 squad finished 75-87 and a franchise-worst 41 games out of first place -- just one year before winning their only World Series title as a wild card.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- Four straight walks by Josh Beckett early in the game had Boston manager Terry Francona slightly concerned. It could have been a long day for the bullpen.	Instead, Beckett settled down nicely -- and his team came from behind to win.	Pinch-hitter Ryan Kalish hit a go-ahead two-run single in the sixth, J.D. Drew had a two-run double one batter earlier and the Red Sox rallied for a 5-3 victory over the Oakland Athletics on Sunday.	Beckett (5-4) turned to his secondary pitches to get on track after a rocky start as Boston avoided its first sweep by the A's since May 23-25, 2008. The Red Sox have been swept in the series only three times in the last 18 years.	"Beckett, that was kind of a weird outing," Francona said. "Five walks, but four in a row. You're kind of on the edge of your seat after the third inning."	Dallas Braden (9-12), still trying to reach double digits in wins for the first time in his career, lost his third straight start. All the damage came in that tough sixth inning. The left-hander also struggled with location, walking four after issuing two or fewer walks in each of his previous 20 starts.	"The story today was I provided a nice walkathon for them," Braden said. "It was just gross. I don't ever complain on balls and strikes because I'm a big believer that that stuff evens out over the course of a season, but today was bad. Period."	Oakland's Coco Crisp stole six bases in the series against his former team, including his career-high 29th and 30th on Sunday.	The Red Sox added an insurance run in the eighth on pitcher Jerry Blevins' wild throw past first trying to get Drew on a single. That allowed pinch-runner Josh Reddick to score.	Before the sixth, "we weren't doing anything," Francona said.	Boston won for only the fifth time in its last 13 road games. The Red Sox still have three games in Seattle starting Monday to conclude their second-to-last trip of the year.	Jonathan Papelbon worked a perfect ninth with three called strikeouts for his 36th save in 43 chances, pitching for the first time in seven days. He threw 48 pitches in his career-high seventh blown save and loss to the White Sox on Sept. 5.	Daric Barton was ejected after making the final out by home plate umpire Hunter Wendelstedt for arguing the called third strike.	"I know some guys weren't very happy about it, but you have to make adjustments," Oakland catcher Kurt Suzuki said of the strike zone. "There's no mystery to it: If he's going to call it, you have to swing."	Crisp got his 29th steal in the third for a new career high, topping his 28 for the Red Sox in 2007. He stole No. 30 in the sixth -- and on a day Hall of Fame speedster and Crisp mentor Rickey Henderson gave a pushup demonstration in the clubhouse pregame to show he still has it at 51.	This marked the first time the Red Sox gave up six steals to an A's player since Henderson had six from July 2-4, 1984.	Mark Ellis hit a two-run double in the fifth to put the A's up 3-0. Ellis extended his hitting streak to a career-high 12 games with an infield single in the second.	Cliff Pennington hit a two-out triple in the bottom of the sixth after the Red Sox took the lead, but Oakland couldn't capitalize.	Beckett ran into trouble in the third, when he walked four straight batters and issued Jack Cust's free pass to force in the first run of the game.	"I think I should only have walked three of them," Beckett said, questioning one of the walks but not specifying.	After Kurt Suzuki drew a walk for Beckett's third consecutive base on balls, he received a mound visit from pitching coach John Farrell. Then catcher Victor Martinez came out to chat during Cust's plate appearance.	Yet Beckett got out of the inning without further damage, retiring Ellis on a called third strike and Jeremy Hermida on a liner.	"After you get out of something like that, it's easy to take a deep breath and get back to what you know works," Beckett said. "I don't think rhythm would be the right word, just battling."	It was the first time he walked so many in one inning since issuing five walks in the top of the first on Sept. 23, 2004, while with Florida against Philadelphia -- but those didn't all come in order. He walked four in a row for the first time in his career.	Beckett allowed three runs on five hits in six innings, struck out seven and walked five to win for the first time in three starts. He had lost two of his last three decisions but was coming off a season-best nine-strikeout performance in a no-decision against the White Sox his last time out.	"A lot of it is perspective," Francona said. "If we didn't score, the first question is, 'What's wrong with Beckett?"	The right-hander has allowed three or fewer earned runs in each of his last seven outings against Oakland, four of those at the Coliseum.	Game notes	Marco Scutaro again started at 2B for the Red Sox. Francona doesn't plan to use him every day at SS for the rest of the season because of his troublesome right shoulder. ... The A's won the season series (5-4) for the first time since going 7-3 in 2006, Oakland's last playoff season.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

SAN DIEGO -- The Padres keep reminding themselves they're still in first place in the NL West.	They are, but only by the slimmest margin.	Tim Lincecum looked every bit a two-time Cy Young Award winner and had a two-run single as the San Francisco Giants roughed up San Diego ace Mat Latos to win 6-1 Sunday and cut the struggling Padres' lead to less than one percentage point.	The Giants won three of four games after having lost nine of their first 11 against the Padres this year. Overall, the Giants have won 10 of 14 while the Padres have lost 13 of 17. San Diego scored only five runs in the four games and has scored four or fewer runs in each of its last 16 games.	San Diego (80-62) leads San Francisco (81-63) by .5634 to .5625. Colorado is just 1 1/2 games back after winning its 10th straight.	"To be able to look back at it, we lost 10 in a row and we're still in first place," Latos said. "Whether we're sharing it or not, we lost 10 games and we're still in first place. Obviously that right there can make a statement. If we keep taking series like we've always tried to do, we still should have no problem with winning it."	The Padres and Giants close the season with a three-game series at San Francisco Oct. 1-3.	"This thing looks like it's going to the wire," said San Francisco's Bruce Bochy, who was forced out as manager of the Padres after they were eliminated from the 2006 playoffs by St. Louis. "Right now, we just have to worry about what we can control."	Rookie Buster Posey hit a two-run homer off Latos (14-6), who had his worst start since April 26. The Giants ended Latos' big league-record streak of 15 straight starts of five or more innings with two or fewer runs allowed.	"It's something that I was able to accomplish, and I'm thankful for it," Latos said of his streak. "It wakes you up to a whole different aspect of baseball. To be able to have that kind of success for such a long time, you're bound to have a bad one and it makes you appreciate the little things more."	Latos, who came in leading the majors with a 2.21 ERA, was gone after four innings. He allowed five runs and seven hits, struck out four and walked two. His ERA rose to 2.43. They were the most runs he'd allowed since tying his career-high by giving up seven runs in a 10-1 loss at Florida on April 26 while lasting just 2 2/3 innings, the shortest outing of his big league career.	"I just had a bad outing," Latos said.	The previous time he gave up three runs was in a 3-2 loss at Philadelphia on June 4.	Lincecum (14-9) has won three straight starts following a career-worst five-game losing streak. The two-time Cy Young Award winner held San Diego to one run and seven hits in seven innings and struck out nine to take over the NL lead with 208. He is the fourth pitcher in Giants history to have more than 200 strikeouts in three consecutive seasons.	Posey homered to right with two outs in the first and Aubrey Huff aboard on a single.	That lead helped Lincecum.	"You have to take advantage of every run you get and turn it into shutdown mode after that," said Lincecum, who added that his slider was the best it's been in a while.	"You hit around Latos the way we did, especially when we haven't been able to do much against him, this series is huge," Lincecum said. "Coming out and scoring two runs in the first inning is huge. It set the pace."	Jose Guillen hit a sacrifice fly in the third and Lincecum hit a two-run single in the fourth that landed just inside the left-field line.	San Diego broke through against Lincecum in the fifth when Will Venable legged out a leadoff triple to right and scored on David Eckstein's two-out single to center.	San Diego's Chase Headley said Lincecum was consistently ahead in the count and threw all his pitches for strikes.	"He's as good as there is when he's on," Headley said. "He pitched a good game."	Headley said it was "unfortunate" that the Padres are scuffling offensively. "It seems like we kind of had everyone go into a funk at the same time. The only good thing about that is, sometimes you get everyone out of the funk at the same time, too. We would have liked to play better this series, but we didn't. We're still tied for first. It's not the end of the world. We can still go out and play well, and if we do, that we're going to be in the playoffs."	Game notes	 Padres RHP Chris Young was encouraged by his third rehab start, in which he allowed three hits in 5 2/3 scoreless innings with seven strikeouts and one walk for Class A Lake Elsinore on Saturday night. Asked if he feels good enough to pitch in the bigs again this year, he said: "Yes. No doubt about it."	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ATLANTA -- Tony La Russa savored a souvenir, and Albert Pujols savored a milestone.	Pujols hit two home runs to power the St. Louis Cardinals past Atlanta 7-3 on Sunday night, dropping the Braves out of first place in the NL East.	Atlanta fell one game behind the Philadelphia Phillies, who beat the New York Mets 3-0 behind Roy Oswalt.	Pujols passed Hall of Famer Stan Musial for the most multihomer games in Cardinals history with 38, including five this season.	"It's pretty special to be named with that legend," Pujols said.	Barring a playoff matchup, it was the last time La Russa will manage against Atlanta's Bobby Cox, who is retiring after the season.	La Russa beamed when looking at a baseball and lineup card that Cox signed. Each sat on La Russa's desk after the game.	"That's a keeper," said La Russa, holding the lineup card. "That's not going anywhere."	La Russa said Cox "has had the best managerial career of anybody I've been around. ... He's done it exactly the right way, which is most important."	"I hope he gets to the postseason. I hope they get to the postseason."	La Russa is third in career regular-season wins. Cox ranks fourth. The two managed against each other in 161 regular-season games in a rivalry that began in 1982 when Cox was with Toronto and La Russa managed the Chicago White Sox. Cox finished with a 94-67 advantage.	A ball signed by La Russa sat on Cox's desk.	"I like Tony a lot," Cox said. "I've been going at it with Tony a long, long time."	Kyle Lohse (3-7) allowed nine hits but only two runs in 5 1/3 innings to beat Tim Hudson (15-8), who gave up six runs in five innings in his third straight loss.	"I was keeping the ball up a little more than I wanted, falling behind a little more than I wanted, having to give in and throw a little more over the plate than I would have liked," Hudson said. "It just wasn't a good night for me."	The second-place Cardinals gained a game in the NL Central but still trail Cincinnati by six. With a split of the four-game set, St. Louis won the season series 6-2.	Nate McLouth had a homer and a double for Atlanta. Cardinals center fielder Colby Rasmus robbed McLouth of another possible homer with a leaping catch at the wall in the fourth.	Pujols had three RBIs on Saturday, giving him 10 straight seasons with more than 100. He leads the NL with 39 homers and 104 RBIs. He also hit a homer Thursday in the opening game of the four-game series.	La Russa said Pujols plays "in a different home run climate than when Stan played."	"Because Albert did it in 10 years, I don't want to take anything away from him, but I don't want to take anything away from Stan," La Russa said.	La Russa said before the game that Pujols has had difficulty with his left elbow. La Russa said Pujols landed on the elbow while making a catch in Pittsburgh late last month and hurt the elbow again a few days later.	La Russa said Pujols is feeling better and is better able to follow through on his swing. Pujols said after the game he is still having problems.	"There is no DL in September," he said. "You have to keep pushing and try to put us in a good spot."	Pujols gave the Cardinals a 1-0 lead with a homer over the 400-foot mark in center in the first inning and added a line-drive shot to left in the fifth.	His second homer cleared the wall so quickly that left fielder Melky Cabrera barely moved as he turned to watch it land in the seats.	Yadier Molina had a run-scoring single in the third. The Cardinals added four runs in the fifth. After Pujols' second homer, Lohse had an RBI single and Brendan Ryan added a two-run triple.	Jason Heyward had doubles in each of his first two at-bats for Atlanta and scored on Martin Prado's single in the third. Alex Gonzalez had three hits, including a single in the sixth to drive in McLouth.	McLouth added a homer in the eighth off Blake Hawksworth.	Game notes	 Braves rookie 1B Freddie Freeman turned 21 on Sunday. He was selected as the club's minor league player of the year before the game. He entered in the seventh. ... Hudson has allowed a combined total of 13 runs in his three straight losses, increasing his ERA from 2.24 to 2.62.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Bobby Cramer kept believing in himself all those years, even if few others did.	Cramer's long and winding trek culminated with a win in his major league debut Monday when he pitched the Oakland Athletics past the Kansas City Royals 3-1.	"Just getting here was amazing in itself, but now that I'm here I want to pitch well and want to show everybody who I think I can be up here," he said.	Cramer (1-0), a left-hander who turns 31 next month, started his pro career in 2003 in the Tampa Bay system. Cut by the Rays, he was a substitute high school math teacher and worked in pipeline maintenance while out of baseball in 2005-06.	Cramer played in an independent league in 2008 and then began this year in the Mexican League.	"There were times I felt this was an uphill battle, that I may never get over that hump," he said. "I never doubted my own ability. I had a lot of internal confidence. I felt like I was good enough. That's what made me persist. I wanted to challenge myself to get to the next level."	Cramer held the Royals to one run and four hits in 5 1/3 innings. He struck out four and walked one.	Cramer went 13-3 with a 2.95 ERA in 22 games with Quintana in Mexico this season.	At that point, he wasn't about to give up.	"When I got released in '05, I tried to convince myself I was done," he said. "I was with Tampa and at the time they were a struggling organization that would give young guys a chance and promote you if you played well. I couldn't even get out of A ball with them. I thought that was god's way of trying to tell me that this just isn't it. The problem is I quit physically, but I never quit mentally."	Cramer became the oldest pitcher in Athletics franchise history to make a start in his big league debut since Steve Gerkin for the Philadelphia A's on May 13, 1945.	"When you travel a road as tough as the one he has, I think he's more appreciative of this opportunity, a little older, more mature, tougher mentally sometimes than a young kid," A's manager Bob Geren said. "I'm very happy with him going that deep into the game and keeping a lead. You'll definitely see him again."	Andrew Bailey worked the ninth for his 24th save in 27 opportunities.	Jack Cust hit his 100th home run, connecting in the Oakland sixth off Bryan Bullington.	Mike Aviles homered in the fourth for the only run off Cramer. Aviles hit his first home run since May 9, a span of 316 at-bats, and finished with three of the Royals' seven hits.	Luke Hochevar (5-5) lost in his first start since missing nearly three months with a sprained right elbow. He gave up two unearned runs and two hits in five innings. He walked three and threw just 39 strikes in 78 pitches.	"I didn't feel like my command was sharp," Hochevar said. "I had too many three-ball counts. I put myself in that situation. If I'm on top of my game the defense is going to be there. But when I'm lulling my defenders to sleep, that's when errors happen. I'm past the elbow issue. Now it's about executing pitches and getting batters out."	The A's took advantage of sloppy Royals fielding to take an early lead.	"I wouldn't even classify it as an eyesore," Royals manager Ned Yost said of his defense. "It was worse. It wasn't good baseball. We'd still be out there playing if we hadn't given them a couple."	In the first inning, Aviles and Hochevar made errors and rookie catcher Lucas May was charged with a passed ball. Aviles' wild throw from second base on what could have been a double-play grounder by Kurt Suzuki allowed Coco Crisp to score.	Crisp began the game reaching on Hochevar's error and stealing second. Crisp has stolen at least one base in five straight games, totaling nine in that span, to run his total to a career-high 32.	Crisp's string of 24 steals ended in the fifth when he was caught trying to swipe third base.	Royals center fielder Jarrod Dyson, making his first big league start, dropped Cliff Pennington's fly in the second for an error that let Aki Iwamura score.	Game notes	 Royals utilityman Willie Bloomquist was pulled from the starting lineup and traded to the Cincinnati Reds. The Royals will receive a player to be named or cash. ... The A's transferred outfielder-first baseman Conor Jackson, who had sports hernia surgery Sept. 1, to the 60-day disabled list to make roster space for Iwamura, who was signed as a free agent. Iwamura started at third as Kevin Kouzmanoff missed his seventh straight game with lower back spasms.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

BALTIMORE -- After waiting the entire season to beat the Toronto Blue Jays, the Baltimore Orioles didn't mind at all playing a couple extra innings to make it happen.	Luke Scott singled in the winning run in the bottom of the 11th and Baltimore ended a 12-game losing streak against the Blue Jays with a 4-3 victory Monday night.	Brian Roberts homered for the Orioles, now 1-12 against Toronto this season. Those 12 losses came before manager Buck Showalter arrived in Baltimore and rejuvenated a 32-73 team that has gone 24-15 since his debut on Aug. 3.	"It's no secret, we've been playing better baseball since he got the job," shortstop Cesar Izturis said. "It's a different ballclub. We've got more energy right now."	Nick Markakis led off the 11th with a single off Brian Tallet (2-6). After a groundout by Ty Wigginton advanced Markakis, Scott lined a single to center that easily brought home the decisive run.	"He made his pitch. It was a cutter that actually ran off the plate," Scott said. "It worked out good for me because I hit it off the end of the bat and the ball wasn't able to stay up. It's a funny game how it works out, but it's a good win for us."	Baltimore improved to 12-3 in extra innings this season.	"To our credit, facing adversity we haven't given up," Scott said. "We've been battling hard for everything that we get. Hopefully that attitude will turn things around for us."	David Hernandez (7-8) got two outs to earn the victory.	Baltimore won despite going 2-for-11 with runners in scoring position and stranding 15.	The game attracted a meager crowd of 9,882, in part because it was played while the Baltimore Ravens faced the New York Jets in a televised NFL game. The smallest gathering in the 19-year history of Camden Yards is 9,129.	Edwin Encarnacion homered for the Blue Jays, extending Toronto's streak of successive games with a home run to 15 -- the team's longest such run since July 2000. It was the 14th homer of the season for Encarnacion, who came off the disabled list Monday after being sidelined with a sprained left wrist.	Orioles starter Brian Matusz pitched only one inning before leaving with a bruise on the back of his upper arm, an injury that occurred when he was struck by a line drive off the bat of Yunel Escobar. The rookie had won his previous four starts.	"It's fine," Matusz said of the injury. "It's in a spot that really doesn't scare me too much."	Rick VandenHurk came in and retired the first 12 batters before Encarnacion hit a 1-1 pitch into the left-field seats leading off the sixth. VandenHurk allowed one run and two hits in 5 1/3 innings.	Baltimore led 3-1 before the Blue Jays rallied in the eighth. Two singles and a grounder put runners at second and third with two outs for Escobar, who grounded a two-run single up the middle off Jim Johnson.	It would be Toronto's last hit.	"Our guys battled pretty hard to get back into the game," Toronto manager Cito Gaston said. "We needed one more run and we didn't come up with it."	After Matusz ended his stint by striking out Lyle Overbay with two outs and runners on second and third, Roberts got the Orioles started with his 13th career leadoff homer, a drive to left on a 3-2 pitch from Marc Rzepczynski.	Baltimore made it 2-0 in the second when Adam Jones doubled and scored on a chopper down by the third-base line by Brandon Snyder, the rookie's first major league hit and RBI.	Rzepczynski gave up two runs and six hits in five innings.	"I threw my breaking ball more in hitters' counts," Rzepczynski said. "So, getting back into the counts helped me get outs. I was able to get some ground balls later on in the game."	Baltimore went up 3-1 in the seventh. With the bases loaded and two outs, Shawn Camp hit Jones with a pitch to force in a run.	Game notes	 Roberts was hit by a pitch near his right knee in the eighth inning and replaced in the ninth. ... Toronto hired Jay Sartori as assistant general manager Monday. Sartori was most recently director of baseball operations for the Washington Nationals. ... VandenHurk's outing was the longest by an Oriole this season.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.

ATLANTA -- Derek Lowe decided it was time for a new plan against Washington, so he asked Braves pitching coach Roger McDowell for help.	With his "cheat sheet" from McDowell sitting in his locker, Lowe set a career high with 12 strikeouts and combined with Billy Wagner on a six-hitter to lead Atlanta past the Nationals 4-0 on Monday night.	Entering the game, Lowe was 1-6 with a 5.44 ERA in nine starts for Atlanta against Washington in 2009 and 2010, according to STATS LLC.	He said he went to McDowell on Monday and said, "I need help."	"I give Roger every bit of credit for the game," Lowe said. "I hadn't beaten this team in about three years."	After conferring with McDowell, Lowe went over the plan with catcher Brian McCann.	Known for his sinker and ability to produce ground balls, Lowe said his plan was, "Just try different things, use more pitches and try not to throw certain pitches to certain guys."	It worked. The Braves remained one game behind first-place Philadelphia in the NL East. The Phillies beat Florida 11-4.	Lowe (13-12) was 0-3 with a 6.11 ERA in his first three starts against Washington this season before delivering an impressive win marked by two personal milestones.	He earned an ovation from the small crowd of 18,647 with his 1,500th career strikeout against Ian Desmond in the fourth. Lowe struck out Wilson Ramos in the eighth for his 12th of the game.	The right-hander gave up six hits and no walks in eight innings.	"We just looked at video and looked at what Derek's strengths are and tried to apply it to this game," McDowell said. "To his credit, he was able to execute all his pitches."	Lowe called the win "about the best game I've pitched in a long time."	The Nationals were impressed.	"Our hitters to a man said that was the best they've seen him," said Washington manager Jim Riggleman, who compared Lowe's control with former Braves standouts Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux.	"He took what the ump gave him. He was putting it where Glavine used to put it and where Maddux used to put it."	In one stretch early in the game, five straight strikeouts for Lowe came on called third strikes.	"He spotted the ball more," said Washington's Ryan Zimmerman, who had two hits. "He mixed it up. He threw on both sides of the plate. He was definitely on his game. ... When he's hot like that, nibbling on the corners like that, it's difficult to get to him."	Added Desmond, who had four strikeouts: "He pitched me a little different than last time."	Wagner struck out the side in the ninth to complete a game that took just 2 hours, 13 minutes.	The Nationals have lost six straight, matching their longest skid of the season.	Lowe ended August with three straight losses but has recovered with two strong wins in September. He gave up only one run in six innings of a 9-3 win at Pittsburgh on Wednesday before earning his first win in four 2010 starts against the Nationals.	"That's as good as I've ever seen Derek," Braves manager Bobby Cox said. "My gosh, he threw nothing but strikes. "I can't say enough about his performance tonight. That looks good for the remainder [of the season]."	Washington's 29-year-old rookie, Yunesky Maya (0-2), endured a four-run second to last six innings. He gave up five hits and four runs with three walks and two strikeouts.	"I was really happy with how he competed," Riggleman said. "I thought he did fine. He gave us a chance."	Ross Detwiler followed Maya with two scoreless innings as the Braves were held to five hits.	Maya trailed 4-0 following a long second inning in which he gave up three hits, walked two batters, hit a batter with a pitch and was called for two balks.	Maya walked McCann and Derrek Lee to open the inning and was called for two balks by plate umpire Dan Iassogna, allowing McCann to score. Nate McLouth's double to right drove in Lee. Matt Diaz added a run-scoring triple to the right-field corner and scored on Omar Infante's single.	Maya, a right-hander from Cuba, was recalled from Triple-A Syracuse on Sept. 7.	Game notes	 It was Atlanta's eighth shutout this season. ... Lowe had 11 strikeouts for the Dodgers against the Angels on June 15, 2007, for his previous career high. His previous season high was seven against Philadelphia on June 2. ... The Nationals fell to 25-48 on the road. They also lost six straight from June 15-20.	The Braves added depth at catcher by signing Manny Pina to a two-year, $8 million contract.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

CINCINNATI -- No one can call the Cincinnati Reds losers anymore.	Jay Bruce returned from a two-week layoff and homered in each of his first two at-bats Monday night, and the Reds went deep five times in all during a 7-2 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks that secured their first winning season since 2000.	The Reds' nine-year streak of losing seasons was their longest in a half-century. The last time they finished above .500, Ken Griffey Jr. was in his first season with his hometown team.	"I don't know if it means a lot to this group of guys," starter Bronson Arroyo said. "We weren't around for all the hard times. We're a young team. For the organization and the city, it's got to be satisfying."	With each win, the NL Central leaders close in on another breakthrough -- their first playoff appearance since 1995. They moved seven games ahead of second-place St. Louis, which lost to the Cubs 5-1.	"Winning the division is the next step," manager Dusty Baker said. "The next step is the playoffs. We've got one step out of the way. There's three or four more to go."	They're starting to get some of their injured players back along the way.	Bruce missed the last two weeks because of a strained abdomen. He hit a solo homer and a two-run shot off Barry Enright (6-4), and later added an RBI single.	When he got to the dugout after his second homer, catcher Ramon Hernandez had a question.	"He said, 'That easy, huh?' " Bruce said. "I said, 'No, it's not that easy.' "	The Reds made it look easy all-around. Drew Stubbs, Joey Votto and Orlando Cabrera added solo homers. Arroyo (15-10) gave up a pair of solo shots in six innings while reaching 15 wins for the third straight season.	Miguel Montero and Ryan Church hit back-to-back homers in the second inning. Arroyo gave up seven hits overall and struck out a season-high eight even though he felt tired.	"The velocity was way down on my fastball," said Arroyo, who was clocked around 84 mph. "You don't have your zip sometimes."	Cincinnati sold only 12,061 tickets -- its smallest crowd this season -- for the breakthrough win.	The Reds took two of three last weekend from Pittsburgh despite big problems in the bullpen, which blew three save chances and set up a pair of extra-inning games. The home run barrage prevented any late drama this time.	Arizona fell to 0-4 this season against Cincinnati. The Diamondbacks have lost eight of their last nine overall.	The Reds made a trade before the game to help their injury-thinned outfield, acquiring Willie Bloomquist from the Royals. Bloomquist will join the team on Tuesday.	Cincinnati played the weekend series against Pittsburgh with only two fully healthy experienced outfielders -- Jonny Gomes in left and Stubbs in center. Bruce was originally out of Monday's lineup, but Baker changed his mind because outfielder Chris Heisey was sore.	Bruce reassured Baker that he felt fine.	Better than fine, as it turned out.	"That was more than we could ask for right there," Baker said. "It was a big day for Jay. It was a big day for us. We needed that badly."	Bruce hit the fifth pitch he saw into the seats in right field, picking up his power surge. The outfielder was working on a stretch of five homers in four games when he pulled an abdominal muscle during batting practice on Aug. 31, forcing him from the lineup.	In his next at-bat, Bruce hit a two-run shot off Enright, who hadn't allowed more than two homers in any of his other 13 starts during his debut season. Enright gave up seven hits and five runs in only three innings, by far his shortest start so far.	"Balls were middle-up and my breaking ball was flat," he said.	Game notes	 Diamondbacks 3B Mark Reynolds got a day of rest. He has a sore hand and is in an 0-for-23 slump. ... Arizona called up C Konrad Schmidt, who batted .315 at Double-A Mobile. ... Diamondbacks pinch-hitter Rusty Ryal fouled off 10 pitches with two strikes against LHP Bill Bray. He eventually struck out on the 16th pitch. ... It was Bruce's 19th multihomer game, his fourth this season. He hit three in a 7-1 win over the Cubs on Aug. 27 at Great American Ball Park. ... Reds reliever Jordan Smith was ejected by plate umpire John Hirschbeck for complaining about ball-and-strike calls as he left the field. ... Brandon Phillips ended an 0-for-15 slump with a single in the eighth.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

NEW YORK -- With injured ace Johan Santana scheduled to have shoulder surgery Tuesday that could keep him out for the start of next season, Dillon Gee is pitching his way into consideration for a spot in the New York Mets' 2011 rotation.	Nick Evans is using his infrequent opportunities to appeal for a place on the big league roster, too.	Pinch-hitting with one out in the 10th inning, Evans singled home the winning run off Chan Ho Park to give New York a 1-0 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Monday night.	Whether it's taking a no-hitter into the sixth inning of his first major league start or fighting through a lack of command against Pittsburgh for six innings of five-hit ball, Gee has gotten the job done. His manager is taking notice -- despite saying before the game that September auditions are not good indicators of success.	"When you throw shutout innings, it has to translate into something positive," Jerry Manuel said. "He has a chance to be a real decent pitcher at this level."	Evans, with three hits in 11 at-bats this season, drove in Ruben Tejada, a .188 hitter who had a one-out double. Jose Tabata fielded Evans' hit off Park (1-2) in shallow left, but his throw was off line and Tejada scored easily.	"It's good to get in there and help contribute to the game," Evans said. "I'd love to be given the opportunity" to be a role player on the team.	Hisanori Takahashi (9-6) pitched two innings to run his scoreless streak to 12 outings and 13 1/3 innings. He got a boost from his catcher, Josh Thole.	Thole threw out a runner trying to steal in the ninth and then nailed Andrew McCutchen at third trying to advance on a bunt in the 10th. McCutchen led off the inning with a double.	"He's made some very, very good throws to second base," Manuel said. "He's evolving as one of the young leaders of the team."	Elsewhere on the local sports docket, the New York Jets were playing their NFL season opener on Monday Night Football -- one of several enticing options for fans rather than a rain-delayed matchup between anemic offenses at Citi Field.	In fact, the Mets posted a message on the scoreboard during the second inning inviting the sparse crowd that waited out a 43-minute delay at the start to fill the pricey seats behind the dugouts.	But Takahashi was focused on one thing.	"Even though everybody's kind of interested in the Jets game, I do what I can do for the baseball," he said through a translator.	Those who did make it to the Mets game saw two young pitchers, Gee and Pittsburgh's James McDonald, make promising starts.	Starting in place of Santana last Tuesday, Gee took a no-hitter into the sixth against Washington in his major league debut. He wasn't quite that effective against the worst-hitting team in the National League. Using a deceptive changeup, the right-hander gave up five hits -- two weak doubles just inside third-base line -- and walked four, one intentionally. He put runners on base in five innings and loaded them in the fourth.	"It just seemed like when I got some guys on I could locate it inside and get some popups," Gee said.	Gee was pulled after 106 pitches. Elmer Dessens and Pedro Feliciano each pitched a hitless inning. The shutout was the Mets' 19th of the season, most in the majors.	In two starts, Gee has given up one run and seven hits in 13 innings.	McDonald was coming off seven innings of five-hit ball against Atlanta, beating Braves ace Tim Hudson to win for the first time in four starts. McDonald went a career-high eight innings this time, scattering five hits and getting help from two caught stealings.	"James did a great job. Really battled," Pirates manager John Russell said. "He's got the stuff. ... He's able to keep his pitch count low now and when he does that, he's really grown."	A group of Pedro Alvarez fans wearing yellow Pirates T-shirts with his name and number on the back stood and cheered the New Yorker with every at-bat. Alvarez, who went to a private high school in New York, was playing his first big league game in the Big Apple.	Alvarez's parents brought the team chicken, rice and beans from a popular restaurant in Washington Heights, the heavily Dominican neighborhood in northern Manhattan where Alvarez grew up. He went 0-for-3 with a walk.	Game notes	 The Pirates claimed right-hander Chris Leroux off waivers from the Florida Marlins and designated righty reliever Brian Bass for assignment. Leroux was added to the 40-man roster. ... Mets left fielder Lucas Duda went 0-for-3 and has one hit in his first 32 big league at-bats. ... The Mets are 5-2 in 1-0 games this season. ... Pittsburgh second baseman Neil Walker went 0-for-3 with two walks, snapping his 18-game hitting streak.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.
