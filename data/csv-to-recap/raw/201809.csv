DETROIT -- Justin Verlander knew this would be one of the most emotional games of his major league career.	He still wasn't prepared.	In his return to Detroit, Verlander received three standing ovations while pitching the Houston Astros to a 3-2 victory over the Tigers on Monday night.	Verlander (15-9) made his major league debut with the Tigers in 2005 and ranks among the top 10 on several of the team's career lists. He struck out 10 over seven innings in his first time on the Comerica Park mound since being traded to Houston in August 2017.	"Our hotel is right near my old house, so I got to spend some time in the neighborhood today," he said. "I was trying to keep my routine as much as possible."	That hope ended early, as the scoreboard played a tribute video as Verlander was walking in from the bullpen after his pregame warmups. He stopped, alone in shallow right-center field, and watched the entire show.	"It was almost normal until the tribute video, but that really got to me," he said. "I had a lot of great memories in my 13 years here, and that brought it all back. I wanted to get to the dugout before it started, but once it started playing, I had to watch."	Verlander received his first ovation at the end of the video, and another when he came out for the first inning. Each time, he tipped his cap and waved to the fans.	The longest cheer, though, came when he walked off the mound after the seventh, having thrown 104 pitches.	"The one after the seventh really meant the world to me," he said. "The fans here were always great to be here, and they showed that again tonight. That was a really emotional moment."	The crowd was announced at 19,711 -- the Detroit Lions opened their season next door Monday night against the New York Jets.	"Tonight mattered a lot to him," Astros manager AJ Hinch said. "It is important to him that he pitched here and succeeded here, so it was special for him to get back on that mound."	The World Series champion Astros opened a three-game lead over Oakland atop the AL West despite a sloppy game that came after a Sunday night loss in Boston.	"I'm proud of our guys, because there was a lot going on today, and we didn't play our best game, but we still found a way to pull out a win," Hinch said.	Verlander allowed two runs on six hits and one walk, improving to 98-50 at Comerica Park. Max Scherzer is second in career wins at the stadium with 46, while Jordan Zimmermann leads current Tigers with 14.	"He got exactly the response he deserved from our fans," Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire said. "He was a great pitcher here for a long time, and he did a lot of great things for this city."	The Tigers put two runners on in the seventh, but Verlander struck out JaCoby Jones and Jeimer Candelario to escape with a 3-2 lead. He tipped his cap again as the fans came to their feet after the final pitch to Candelario.	"This was a special night," Verlander said.	Roberto Osuna worked the ninth for his 16th save, including seven with Houston.	Francisco Liriano (4-10) allowed three unearned runs on four hits and four walks in six innings. He struck out seven in his longest outing since pitching six innings on July 4.	The Tigers took the lead in the second. Niko Goodrum doubled and later scored on a single by Dawel Lugo.	Liriano's wild pitch and an error by shortstop Ronny Rodriguez allowed the Astros to score three unearned runs in the third. Tyler White and Marwin Gonzalez hit RBI singles, while the Tigers failed to turn two potential double plays.	"You have to make plays," Gardenhire said. "When you miss plays, that's what always happens. We had a chance to get some outs, didn't do it, and it cost us runs."	Verlander settled down after the second, retiring the next nine batters. Candelario walked to start the sixth, Christin Stewart followed with his first major league hit and Nicholas Castellanos had a sacrifice fly.	"If someone had told me that I was going to get my first hit off Justin Verlander in my first major league start . geez," Stewart said. "It was a pretty out-of-body experience."	Castellanos made a leaping catch at the right field fence to take an extra-base hit away from Gonzalez in the eighth.	Josh Reddick, in the game for Houston as a defensive replacement, started an inning-ending double play in the eighth with a sliding catch in left field.	EARLY START	The game started at 6:10 p.m., an hour earlier than originally scheduled, to try to ease traffic congestion with the Lions playing at Ford Field. A day game wasn't possible because of the Astros playing on Sunday night in Boston.	UP NEXT	The teams continue their three-game series Tuesday night with Zimmermann (7-6, 4.03 ERA) facing Houston's Framber Valdez (3-1, 1.37).	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.

CINCINNATI --  If the Los Angeles Dodgers fall short in the competitive NL West, they can blame Scooter Gennett and the Cincinnati Reds.	Gennett snapped out of an 0-for-9 slump with four hits and three RBI, Joey Votto hit a two-run double on his birthday and the Reds improved to 5-0 against the Dodgers this season with a 10-6 victory Monday night.	"I've had a couple rough games in a row," Gennett said. "It's good to have a short memory sometimes. You can't let a couple bad games dictate attitude or focus."	Eugenio Suarez added a solo home run for the last-place Reds, and Jose Peraza scored three runs. That helped Cincinnati overcome Chris Taylor's two-run homer and Yasmani Grandal's solo shot.	Los Angeles dropped 1 1/2 games behind first-place Colorado when the Rockies routed visiting Arizona. The Dodgers had taken two of three at Coors Field last weekend to trim their deficit.	The Reds won the series opener after a four-game sweep at Dodger Stadium in May.	"The first time around, they pitched us well, and we still haven't figured out how to get Gennett out," Los Angeles manager Dave Roberts said. "Obviously, we don't expect to be 0-5 against anybody."	Jared Hughes (4-3) got Yasiel Puig to line into a bases-loaded double play to end the seventh after an 11-pitch at-bat.	"We were one hit away from it being a completely different game," Roberts said.	Hughes added a perfect eighth to get the win.	"That was the second time this year I've faced Puig with runners on and he's hit a line drive to third," said Hughes, who fell behind Puig with a 2-0 count. "Before that he was 4 for 4 against me with two home runs. I think that is the line."	Gennett went 4 for 5 to boost his batting average to .320 with his sixth multihit game in his last nine appearances. He took over the league lead from Milwaukee outfielder Christian Yelich, who is hitting .315.	Votto, celebrating his 35th birthday, just missed a three-run homer in Cincinnati's four-run first inning, settling for a two-run double with a drive that bounced off the yellow padding along the top of the right-field wall and stayed in play.	Alex Wood (8-7) was knocked around in his shortest outing in 14 starts since lasting a season-low two innings on June 3 at Colorado. The Reds piled up eight hits and seven runs, six earned, against him with two walks and six strikeouts. The seven runs allowed matched Wood's season high, set on April 11 in the third of his team-high 27 starts.	"It was one of those nights when I didn't have anything," Wood said. "You try to battle, but this is not a place where you can come and not be sharp and expect to do well."	Taylor hit his second homer in three games off left-hander Cody Reed, who overcame a 30-pitch first inning to last four. He gave up five hits and three runs with three walks and five strikeouts.	Reed struck out Enrique Hernandez to leave the bases loaded in the first.	BEEN A WHILE	The Reds' five-game winning streak against Los Angeles is their longest since winning seven straight in 1976.	POWER SURGE	The Dodgers have hit at least one home run in 18 straight games, the longest streak since the team moved to Los Angeles in 1958. The franchise record is 24 in a row, set by Brooklyn in 1953.	FAR EAST-BOUND	Suarez and Taylor will be among the major leaguers headed to Japan to play seven games against Japanese players in November.	BACK TO EARTH	Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen rejoined the team in Cincinnati after avoiding Denver. Jansen developed an irregular heartbeat on the team's last Colorado trip and the team cardiologist advised him not to pitch at higher altitudes.	ROSS GETS NOD	Dodgers RHP Ross Stripling (8-3) will start Wednesday's series finale, Roberts said. LHP Clayton Kershaw was originally scheduled to start before being pushed back a day to start at St. Louis on Thursday. The start will be Stripling's 18th, and first since Aug. 9. He came off the disabled list Friday after being out since Aug. 12 with lower back inflammation.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: LHP Julio Urias was activated from the disabled list after missing more than a year following left shoulder surgery in June 2017.	Reds: LHP Amir Garrett was activated off the DL. Garrett was out since Aug. 29 with a bruised left foot.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: LHP Hyun-Jin Ryu (4-2), the scheduled starter Tuesday at Cincinnati, allowed 10 hits and five runs -- one earned -- in six innings of Los Angeles' 7-3 loss to the Mets last Wednesday.	Reds: RHP Luis Castillo (8-12) was tagged for a career-high three homers in his last start Thursday against San Diego.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  With time running short and so much ground to make up, the Tampa Bay Rays will probably miss the postseason. But they certainly look like a playoff team right now.	Ji-Man Choi hit a two-run homer off Brad Hand with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning, and the Rays beat the Cleveland Indians 6-5 on Monday night to set a team record with their 12th straight victory at home.	"That was my first career walk-off homer and that was awesome," Choi said through a translator.	The Rays have won 17 of 20 overall after a rare victory (2-51) when trailing after eight innings.	Cleveland ace Corey Kluber was chased in the second, but the Indians rallied before blowing a late lead. Even with the defeat, their magic number dropped to four to clinch their third consecutive AL Central championship when second-place Minnesota lost 7-2 to the New York Yankees.	Tommy Pham grounded a single to right field before Choi went deep against Hand (0-1). Choi entered 1 for 21 in his career against left-handers.	The Indians have lost six of 10.	It appeared Jose Ramirez's nifty baserunning would help Cleveland overcome a poor start by Kluber.	Ramirez was hit by Chaz Roe's pitch to start the seventh. He stole second and third before scoring to put the Indians ahead 5-4 with a headfirst slide to beat second baseman Brandon Lowe's throw home on Yonder Alonso's grounder.	Kluber lasted just 1 2/3 innings -- matching his career low -- and gave up four runs and five hits. The right-hander and Tampa Bay's Blake Snell are tied for the most wins in the majors with 18.	"I just wasn't able to get that last out," Kluber said.	Jake Bauers homered for the Rays, who moved within 7 1/2 games of Oakland for the second AL wild card with 19 games left.	Jamie Schultz (2-0) worked a scoreless ninth to get the win.	Cleveland reliever Andrew Miller, reinstated from the 10-day disabled list after being out since Aug. 27 with a left shoulder injury, struck out two during a perfect sixth inning.	"Today is a really good start," Miller said. "I'm happy with it."	Six Cleveland relievers limited Tampa Bay to one hit entering the ninth. Indians pitchers finished with 16 strikeouts.	After striking out two during an 11-pitch first inning, Kluber was pulled after 44 pitches in the second with the Indians trailing 4-0.	Willy Adames hit an RBI single, Bauers had a two-run shot and Choi was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded.	"He's one of the best in the league," Bauers said about Kluber. "You've got to get simple and try and stick to an approach. We just made the adjustment."	Kluber gave up two hits over seven innings in a 3-0 win against Tampa Bay on Aug. 31.	Edwin Encarnacion had an RBI single in the first and Ramirez hit a run-scoring double in the fifth.	Cleveland tied it 4-all on pinch-hitter Brandon Guyer's two-run double in the sixth.	Pham singled in the second and has a career-high 14-game hitting streak.	The Rays became the 29th team to reach 1 million (1,006,766) in home attendance with an announced crowd of 12,724. Only the Miami Marlins (747,450) have lower attendance at home.	SETTLING THE SCORE?	Indians manager Terry Francona and Rays skipper Kevin Cash are close friends, which has led to a series of pranks. Cash stole the scooter Francona rides from his downtown apartment to the ballpark earlier this month in Cleveland. In response, Francona talked about messing with Cash's truck. Cash joked about using Uber and Lyft on Monday. "He told me sincerely not to do anything to his truck," a smiling Francona said. "He sounded so sad."	NUMBERS GAME	The Indians are 77-4 when ahead entering the ninth inning. . Bauers' homer was his 10th but first since Aug. 1. He has just two extra-base hits in his last 95 at-bats.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: 3B Josh Donaldson (left calf) will return and start Tuesday.	Rays: CF Kevin Kiermaier (illness) and 3B Matt Duffy (lower back tightness) didn't play.	UP NEXT	Indians RHP Shane Bieber (9-3) and Rays RHP Tyler Glasnow (0-3) are Tuesday night's starters.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

CHICAGO --  Right after Tommy La Stella struck out swinging for the final out, Jeremy Jeffress pounded his glove with his right hand and Erik Kratz pumped his right arm in jubilation.	Forget about the wild-card standings. The Milwaukee Brewers are fighting for the NL Central title.	Lorenzo Cain had four hits, Mike Moustakas scored on Carl Edwards Jr.'s wild pitch in the sixth inning and the Brewers beat the Chicago Cubs 3-2 on Monday night to move within one game of the division leaders.	"That's a great team over there. They're not going to go away," Moustakas said. "They're not going to just give it up, so we've got to go out there every single day, keep fighting, keep grinding and go to win a ballgame each and every night."	Orlando Arcia and Jonathan Schoop each drove in a run as Milwaukee (83-62) won for the seventh time in eight games. It's the closest the Brewers have been to the division lead since they trailed the Cubs by a game on Aug. 5.	Milwaukee also battled Chicago for the NL Central title last season, but the Cubs pulled away down the stretch and the Brewers missed the playoffs. It looks as if the returning Brewers learned from what happened in 2017.	"I think being in the moment a year later helps these guys," manager Craig Counsell said. "You know how you feel because you feel different in these moments."	Wade Miley (4-2) pitched five effective innings before Corbin Burnes, Josh Hader and Jeffress closed it out for wild card-leading Milwaukee. Burnes worked a scoreless sixth, Hader struck out six straight batters and Jeffress got three outs for his 11th save.	Back home after a soggy weekend in Washington, Chicago (83-60) lost for the fifth time in seven games. Ben Zobrist had two of the Cubs' five hits, and Kris Bryant drove in a run.	"We've just not been making that kind of hard contact that we're capable of," manager Joe Maddon said. "So more than anything, that was tonight. You can dice it up any way you want, but just to score two runs again -- we have to be more offensively."	The game was tied at 2 when Maddon and a trainer came out to check on Jon Lester after the left-hander retired the first two batters in the sixth. Lester (15-6) stayed in the game after a short conversation, and the Brewers pounced.	Moustakas singled and Kratz doubled to right, putting runners on second and third. Lester then departed with lower back tightness, and Moustakas scampered home when Edwards missed badly on his first pitch to Arcia .	Moustakas said third base coach Ed Sedar told him to be on the lookout for a wild pitch.	"It happened and I was able to get down there and ended up scoring," Moustakas said, "so it worked out pretty well for us."	Lester allowed eight hits, struck out seven and walked two in his first loss since Aug. 11. The All-Star said he thinks his back will be fine.	"It's not anything painful, just kind of uncomfortable," he said. "After I got out of the game and came up here, I felt a lot better, and hopefully tomorrow will be the same."	WORK, WORK, WORK	Chicago is in the midst of 30 straight game days after Sunday's series finale at Washington was rained out and rescheduled for Thursday. But Hurricane Florence is bearing down on the East Coast and the Cubs sound as if they are hoping for another postponement.	"It's (Major League Baseball's) call on something like this," president of baseball operations Theo Epstein said. "Our voices have certainly have been heard, but we don't have any control."	ALL IN GOOD FUN	Brewers bullpen catcher Marcus Hanel drew some boos and a few cheers from fans in the bleachers at Wrigley Field when he took off his warmup top before the game, revealing an Aaron Rodgers jersey. Rodgers directed the Green Bay Packers to a 24-23 comeback victory over the Chicago Bears on Sunday night.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: OF Kyle Schwarber's back is bothering him "a little bit," according to Maddon. ... OF Jason Heyward (right hamstring tightness) ran on the field before the game. Asked if he will be able to play this month, Heyward responded: "We'll see. I'm just saying -- I'm going to do everything necessary, obviously, to be smart about it. But I plan on playing baseball." ... Chicago closer Brandon Morrow (right biceps inflammation) played catch. He likely will have another bullpen session in the next couple of days. ... LHP Drew Smyly, who had Tommy John surgery in July 2017, will not return this season. Smyly is fine, but Epstein said the team ran out of time to bring him back.	UP NEXT	Brewers right-hander Jhoulys Chacin (14-6, 3.59 ERA) and Cubs lefty Jose Quintana (12-9, 4.14 ERA) square off again Tuesday night. Quintana beat Chacin in their previous matchup, pitching two-run ball into the seventh inning of Chicago's 6-4 victory last Wednesday. Quintana is 5-2 with a 1.78 ERA in nine career starts against Milwaukee.	---	Jay Cohen can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/jcohenap	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Gary Sanchez was struggling since coming off the disabled list, and the New York Yankees were off to a so-so September start.	Facing the Minnesota Twins seems to be a cure-all.	Sanchez had three hits, including a mammoth home run, J.A. Happ tossed six shutout innings and the Yankees continued their mastery of the Twins with a 7-2 win on Monday night.	Could his first three-hit game since April 16 be a turning point for the catcher hitting .189?	"I've hit the ball very hard all season and I haven't got the results I wanted. If this is what it takes for me to find a good streak here or a good positive streak, yeah, why not," Sanchez said through an interpreter.	New York has beaten Minnesota nine straight times, including last year's wild card game, outscoring the Twins 66-23. The Yankees are 20-4 in the teams' meetings since July 25, 2015.	The Yankees, 5-4 in the season's final month, increased their lead over idle Oakland to three games for the first AL wild-card spot.	Happ (16-6) allowed six hits and struck out three. Acquired from Toronto on July 26, the left-hander has allowed two or fewer runs in six of eight starts for New York, going 6-0 with a 2.70 ERA.	"I ran into a couple outings before I came over where I really wasn't getting strike one as much as I needed to," he said. "Tonight, I felt like I was ahead in the count a lot and kind of forced them to be aggressive and swing."	Kyle Gibson (7-13) allowed four hits and one earned run in 5 2/3 innings. He was one batter away from tossing six shutout innings before Sanchez crushed low 2-2 fastball 460 feet into the third deck in left field.	"We've talked before about a guy's sweet spot, and some guys like the ball down and that's probably on the fringe of where he likes the ball the most," Gibson said.	Before the bomb, Sanchez was 3 for 29 since coming off the disabled list on Sept. 1.	"You always feel like he's a guy that can get it rolling, and when he does, he's, from a talent standpoint, one of those guys that can carry a club offensively," manager Aaron Boone said.	New York's first eight batters reached base in a six-run seventh. Miguel Andujar had a two-run double and later scored on a double by Giancarlo Stanton, who had been in a 3-for-35 slump. Didi Gregorius doubled home Stanton.	New York was 5 for 17 with runners in scoring position after going 4 for 35 in its previous six games.	"Finally, a lot of really good at-bats to kind of break that game open. It was something I feel like we needed and glad that a lot of guys had a hand in it," Boone said.	JUDGE GETS HIS CUTS	Yankees slugger Aaron Judge took on-field batting practice for the first time since fracturing his right wrist on July 26.	The session included home runs to multiple fields by the 2017 AL Rookie of the Year.	"It went really well; another big step for him to get out on the field," Boone said.	After the game, Judge refused to put a timeline on his return.	"I really don't want to put myself in a box by setting a date and then not making it. . I just need to keep moving forward until the day I get out there."	TRADING GEMS	Twins left fielder Johnny Field made a sliding grab in the fifth to rob Andujar of a hit and save two runs. Third baseman Andujar returned the favor in the bottom of the inning, snaring a sharp liner by Field.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: 1B Luke Voit has been dealing with back stiffness for a couple of days and wants to play through it, but Greg Bird got the start.	Twins: 3B Miguel Sano missed his fifth straight game with lower left leg issues -- including a sore knee that he sustained sliding into second base last Tuesday. ... 1B Tyler Austin went through hitting drills and took batting practice but missed his fourth straight game with a stiff back.	UP NEXT	To provide extra rest for Luis Severino and Masahiro Tanaka, New York's Sonny Gray (10-8, 4.96) is scheduled for a spot start on Tuesday. Removed from the rotation in early August, Gray tossed 6 1/3 scoreless innings in his last spot start, on Aug. 25 in Baltimore. Minnesota will send RHP Tyler Duffey (1-2, 9.00) to the mound for his first start of the season.	--	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  A little bunt by Alcides Escobar paid off big for the Kansas City Royals.	White Sox reliever Jeanmar Gomez threw away Escobar's bunt in the 10th inning Monday night, giving the Royals a 4-3 win over Chicago.	Brian Goodwin led off the Kansas City 10th with a sharp double. Escobar followed with a sacrifice and Gomez (0-2) made a wild toss over third baseman Yolmer Sanchez,  letting the speedy Goodwin score easily.	"Goodwin is a good runner, and he was safe anyway," Escobar said. "If (Gomez) made a good throw, he was safe anyway."	"I knew I needed to move the runner to third base, and I made a good bunt. The pitcher went to third base, and, game over."	White Sox manager Rich Renteria wasn't so sure Goodwin would have been safe with a good throw.	"It looked like he recognized the play was available to him and he just got a little flustered, probably a little excited and just didn't make a very good throw," he said.	Jake Newberry (2-0) pitched a perfect top of the 10th to notch the win.	Whit Merrifield homered on the first pitch from White Sox starter Lucas Giolito. Ryan O'Hearn hit a solo homer in the sixth that made it 3-all -- he connected against Chicago in his big league debut on July 31, and now has 10 home runs in 30 games.	"I'm not thinking about numbers or anything like that," O'Hearn said. "I just go out there every day and try to have quality at-bats. The home runs keep piling up. Hopefully, I'll keep on going."	Adam Engel and Daniel Palka each homered in the Chicago third against Jakob Junis.	"They were throwing me heaters the first AB and start of the second and I think they noticed me diving over the plate a little bit and missing," Palka said of his drive just inside the foul pole. "I just kind of stayed back on the one I got. It was a pretty good pitch, just right where I was looking."	Jose Abreu, activated from the disabled list prior to the game, had three hits for the White Sox. He was put on the DL on Aug. 22 following surgery for testicular torsion.	Junis went eight innings, allowing seven hits. He faced the minimum after giving up Palka's homer, and has a 2.15 ERA in his last seven starts. He wasn't fazed by the rough third inning.	"We didn't really change our game plan," Junis said. "We stayed aggressive, kept pounding the strike zone. We got some quick outs that way."	Giolito pitched seven innings for his fifth quality start in his last six outings.	Merrifield hit his third leadoff homer this season and the Royals added another run in the second after a couple of unusual plays.	With a runner on second, Goodwin hit a slow dribbler up the third base line that appeared to be headed foul, but Sanchez touched the ball in fair territory and resulted in an infield hit. Escobar followed with a blooper to right field, and a run scored while Goodwin was thrown out at second.	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox: RHP Nate Jones is close to returning from the 60-day disabled list. He has been on the DL since June 24 with a muscle strain in his arm.	Royals: Manager Ned Yost said that RHP Ian Kennedy has only the "normal pitching soreness" following his first appearance since June 23. Kennedy went six innings Sunday in Minnesota. He gave up one run on four hits. ... OF Brett Phillips, out since Sept. 5 with a bruised shoulder, took 30 swings off the tee.

ST. LOUIS --  Two weeks ago, St. Louis infielder Matt Adams couldn't buy a hit.	He struggled just to make contact, and was mired in a 0-for-27 slump.	Those days are apparently over.	Adams hit a three-run homer in the eighth inning on Monday night to rally the Cardinals to an 8-7 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates.	St. Louis, which overcame deficits of 4-0 and 6-4, moved two games ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the race for the second wild card spot in the NL. Cincinnati beat Los Angeles 10-6 Monday.	Josh Harrison, Colin Moran and Starling Marte homered for Pittsburgh, which had its five-game winning streak snapped.	Adams homered off Edgar Santana (2-3) to erase a 6-4 deficit.	"He threw a slider middle of the plate, it stayed up and I put the barrel to it," Adams said.	Adams, a former Cardinals player claimed off waivers from Washington on Aug. 21, hit his first homer at Busch Stadium since Sept. 27, 2016. It was his 21st of the season, a career high.	St. Louis manager Mike Shildt remained confident in Adams despite his struggles. Adams struck out eight times during his hitless skid, which spanned Aug. 5-28.	"You have to have a short memory at this level," Adams said. "Or it tends to have a snowball effect."	John Brebbia (2-3) picked up the victory for St. Louis, which has won two in a row.	Carlos Martinez, a former starter, recorded his third save in as many chances. He gave up run-scoring double to Josh Bell with two out. But Martinez got Francisco Cervelli to ground out to Paul DeJong at deep short to end the game. The bang-bang play at first was challenged, but Cervelli was ruled out after a 31-second video review.	DeJong ranged onto the outfield grass to make the play.	"He knows the speed of the runner, he knows the speed of the ball," Shildt said. "He can beat you in a lot of different ways."	St. Louis right-hander Adam Wainwright, making his first start since May 13, gave up four runs on seven hits in five innings. He retired the last eight batters after giving up three runs in the third.	"I've got to execute a lot better than I did today," Wainwright said. "It's good to be back competing. I love being out there."	Shildt said Wainwright will get another start.	"He's earned the opportunity to go again," Shildt said. "I trust his stuff, he's still making pitches."	Matt Carpenter walked to start the go-ahead rally. Jose Martinez followed with a hit to set the stage for Adams' heroics.	Harrison broke a 4-4 tie with a solo shot off Chasen Shreve in sixth. Adam Frazier added a run-scoring hit for a 6-4 lead.	The Cardinals scored four times in the fourth off Trevor Williams, who had allowed just four earned runs over his previous nine starts. DeJong had a two-run double and scored on Harrison Bader's game-tying sacrifice fly.	Williams allowed six hits, struck out six and didn't walk a batter. He was making his sixth start of the season against St. Louis.	"I'm just thankful I'm not pitching against the Cardinals again for the rest of the year," Williams said. "They're a great ball club and I wish them nothing but success going into October."	Williams came into the game on a big-time roll.	"It's been really a strong stretch," Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said. "(Tonight) he rolled his sleeves up, went to work, stopped the bleeding that was going on."	Moran homered in the second off Wainwright, who struck out three and did not walk a batter. Marte ripped a two-run shot in the third, his 19th of the season, for a 3-0 lead.	St. Louis is 33-18 under Shildt, who took over for Mike Matheny on July 15.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: C Yadier Molina missed his fourth straight game with left hamstring tightness suffered Wednesday in Washington. He is expected to return sometime during the current seven-game homestand that began on Monday. ... RHP Adam Wainwright was activated from the 60-day disabled list prior to the game.	UP NEXT	RHP Joe Musgrove (6-8, 3.75) takes on RHP Miles Mikolas (14-4, 3.06) in the second game of the three-game set on Tuesday. Musgrove has gone at least seven innings in five of his last nine starts. The Cardinals are 7-1 in Mikolas' last eight starts.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

DENVER --  In a sixth-inning jam, German Marquez received a visit from his manager and a little advice: Don't do too much. Stay in the moment. Execute.	Bud Black might as well have been talking to his entire team as Colorado chases after its first division title.	Trevor Story hit a three-run homer during a six-run fifth inning, Marquez struck out 11 over seven masterful innings and the NL West-leading Rockies gained more separation with a 13-2 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Monday night.	The Rockies increased their lead to 1 1/2 games over the Los Angeles Dodgers, who lost 10-6 at Cincinnati. The Diamondbacks now trail by 3 1/2 games. This is the latest the Rockies have been alone atop the division since 1995.	"The magnitude of these games is maybe a little bit enlarged because of where we are in the season and the amount of focus on this part of the season. But our guys are responding," Black said. "They're focused. They know what's going on. They're aware of what's around them. It's a group that understands where they are."	David Dahl put the game out of reach with his first career grand slam in a seven-run seventh. Arizona has allowed 10 or more runs four times this season -- three of those to Colorado.	Story provided the big blow with his 32nd homer on a fastball from Silvino Bracho after the reliever took over when starter Zack Godley (14-9) struggled with his command.	Marquez (12-9) had his blazing fastball and breaking ball working in recording his third straight double-digit strikeout performance. The hard-throwing righty now has 44 strikeouts spanning his last four starts, breaking the team record of 42 set by Pedro Astacio in 2000.	"Kind of expect that these days," Dahl said. "Feels like he strikes everyone out."	Marquez's confidence level is at an all-time high. Still, Black had a little talk with him in the sixth -- just to settle him down. It worked as he struck out Steven Souza Jr. to end the threat.	"He's not doing anything special. He's being German Marquez," Black said. "He's repeating his delivery. He's hitting his spots. He's got good stuff. He's pitching with conviction."	Charlie Blackmon, Tony Wolters and DJ LeMahieu each had three hits for Colorado, which bounced back after dropping two of three to the Dodgers over the weekend.	Paul Goldschmidt celebrated his 31st birthday with a single and an RBI on a ground out. Goldschmidt has now reached base in 46 straight road games. His team has dropped three in a row.	"Frustration is high right now. It has been for several days," Diamondbacks Torey Lovullo said. "We are going to press on."	Godley was cruising along until the fifth when he kept trailing off to the side of the mound on his delivery maybe a little more than usual. With the bases loaded, he issued a four-pitch walk to LeMahieu that ended of his night.	"This was one of those games where somebody needed to step up," Godley said. "I did not do that."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rockies: 3B Nolan Arenado has been getting treatment on his sore throwing shoulder. "There's only so much they can do and only make me feel so good," said Arenado, who went 0 for 4 with an RBI. "(Healing) comes with rest. There's no time to rest right now."	DESMOND MILESTONE	On Sept. 10, 2009, with Washington, Ian Desmond made his major league debut. On his nine-year anniversary, he hit a double to lead off the fifth and start the big rally.	"He was a young dynamic player with a skill set that you see present today," Black said.	GOOD BUDDIES	Arenado remembers competing against Goldschmidt in 2009 when he was at Casper of the rookie league and Goldschmidt with Missoula.	"I was playing third base with him hitting and I was terrified," Arenado said. "I was 18 and he was raking then, too. I was super scared."	FAMILIAR NAME	Marquez said he knows Astacio, who offers Marquez advice from time to time.	"It means a lot to me," Marquez said.	UP NEXT	Diamondbacks RHP Zack Greinke (13-9, 3.08 ERA) faces a Rockies team Tuesday night he's beaten twice this season. The Rockies will throw RHP Antonio Senzatela (4-5, 4.92).	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Pitching without his best stuff, Mike Minor was still able to continue his second-half success.	Minor threw six solid innings, allowing just one run on eight hits as the Texas Rangers ended a four-game losing streak with a 5-2 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Monday night.	"The last two outings, I haven't felt great -- mechanically off a little bit. But I felt like they had chances to capitalize and I only gave up the one," Minor said. "I felt really lucky for that."	Ronald Guzman homered and Joey Gallo drove in three runs for Texas. Guzman hit a two-run shot, his 15th, in a four-run second to give Minor (12-7) a comfortable lead.	After starter Jaime Barria walked Adrian Beltre and Jurickson Profar, Gallo doubled them in for a 2-0 lead. Barria walked Hanser Alberto and then gave up the home run to Guzman.	Minor (12-7) had shoulder surgery in 2015, and his 12 wins are his most since then. He had a career-high 13 wins with the Atlanta Braves in 2013.	Over his last seven starts, Minor is 6-1 with a 2.59 ERA. He's won four straight on the road.	"The first half, especially the first couple of months, were really bad," Minor said. "I don't know but it started in spring training where I didn't feel great, mechanically and stuff. I wasn't attacking hitters the way I knew I could. Now, I've made more quality pitches. I feel better, more comfortable out there. Feels like (2014) seems so long ago. I thought I was going to step up there and be an easy transition because I've (started) my whole career besides last year. I thought it wasn't going to be an issue. It was just getting out there every six days and getting some innings underneath me."	Jose Leclerc pitched a scoreless ninth to earn his 10th save as Texas stopped the Angels' four-game winning streak.	Barria (10-9) walked four batters in three innings. He gave up four runs and three hits while throwing only 31 of 60 pitches for strikes.	The four-run second snapped his scoreless streak at 12 innings.	"Jaime was out of sync," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.	Shohei Ohtani had two hits and an RBI for Los Angeles. Mike Trout added two infield singles and made a couple of fantastic catches in center field. Taylor Cole pitched four scoreless innings of relief, retiring all 12 batters he faced.	Cole had shortstop Andrelton Simmons to thank for retiring Elvis Andrus in the fifth. Simmons fielded a grounder deep in the hole and made a one-hop throw from the outfield grass to get Andrus.	Simmons made another terrific play in the eighth to catch a ball over his head. Trout robbed Beltre of two hits, including a diving grab in the eighth.	CAMPAIGN SEASON	Ohtani was selected the American League player of the week after batting .474 with four homers, eight runs, 10 RBI and two stolen bases. It was recently recommended that the two-way player have Tommy John surgery, but he'll still hit the remainder of the season. And he could continue to make his case for AL Rookie of the Year.	"I think the whole Rookie of the Year embodies much of what a player does. It's not just one statistic," Scioscia said. "If you look at how dominant he was when he was healthy pitching, to now the way he's swinging the bat in the batter's box and the numbers he's putting up, it's been a performance so far worthy of Rookie of the Year consideration, and in my mind winning Rookie of the Year."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Rangers: OF Ryan Rua (muscle spasms in back) was reinstated from the disabled list. He had been on the DL since July 27.	Angels: Ohtani was scheduled to meet with general manager Billy Eppler to discuss whether to have Tommy John surgery on his pitching arm. ... Albert Pujols, who recently had knee surgery, will also undergo surgery on his right elbow Wednesday to remove bone spurs. "It was time to shut it down," Pujols said. "You have to look at the long run to be able to get myself ready for next year. And on top of that take care of my elbow and the little things." ... LHP Tyler Skaggs (left adductor strain) is scheduled to throw a simulated game in the next day or two and then will be re-evaluated.	UP NEXT	Rangers: RHP Adrian Sampson will make his second career start Tuesday night and first for Texas. He made one start with Seattle in 2016 but was injured warming up for what would've been his second start and had surgery to repair a torn flexor tendon.	Angels: Right-handed reliever Jim Johnson (5-3, 3.81 ERA) is scheduled to start a "bullpen game" for Los Angeles.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

SAN FRANCISCO --  The Atlanta Braves are threatening to turn a tight NL East race into a runaway finish.	Sean Newcomb pitched six strong innings, Ozzie Albies sparked the offense with two extra-base hits and Atlanta Braves beat the San Francisco Giants 4-1 on Monday night.	The Braves moved five games ahead of Philadelphia atop the NL East and reduced their magic number to 15 with their fourth win in five games.	The Giants lost their ninth straight, matching their worst skid since 2006.	Albies was 2 for 4 with a double, a triple, an RBI and two runs. Kurt Suzuki was 3 for 3, including a double leading off a two-run ninth inning.	Albies scored the go-ahead run in the seventh. He led off with a double against starter Dereck Rodriguez (6-3) and was awarded third when center fielder Gorkys Hernandez's throw trying to catch Albies after a wide turn at first was off the mark. Hernandez was charged with an error.	"Always aggressive," Albies said. "He throws behind me, I'm going."	Albies scored on Dansby Swanson's sacrifice fly that made it 2-1.	Albies had an RBI triple and scored a run in the ninth.	"He's an aggressive kid," Braves manager Brian Snitker said. "He's always looking to advance to the next base, that's for sure."	Newcomb (12-8) allowed a run on three hits. He struck out eight and walked none.	"I was just attacking the hitters the whole time, trying to make them uncomfortable," Newcomb said.	Braves closer A.J. Minter pitched a scoreless ninth for his 14th save.	Rodriguez gave up two runs, one earned, on five hits and two walks in 6 1/3 innings.	"I asked him to go back out for the seventh. I felt good regardless of pitches," Rodriguez said. "I thought I could pitch a pretty good inning. I feel strong. I want to keep going out there.	"I like playing with old school managers. It's the game I learned, bunting guys over to second, and grew up watching. Having Bochy as a manger and him having confidence in me is awesome."	The 26-year-old rookie joined some elite company.	Rodriguez became one of just two pitchers to allow two or fewer runs over six-plus innings 13 times in their first 16 career starts. The other is former Montreal Expos pitcher Steve Rogers, per to Stats, LLC.	The only other Giant to allow two or fewer runs in 13 of their first 16 starts in a season is Juan Marichal (1965).	NOTABLE	Braves OF Ronald Acuna Jr. was among the first eight players named to represent Major League Baseball in the 2018 All-Star Tour with Nippon Professional Baseball in Japan, which opens Nov. 7 at the Tokyo Dome. ... Acuna's 25th home run on Sunday moved him into a three-way tie fifth place on the career list for players under 21 with Hall of Famers Eddie Matthews (1952) and Orlando Cepeda (1958).	TRAINER'S ROOM	Braves: RHP Arodys Vizcaino (right shoulder inflammation) will throw a bullpen session Tuesday for the first time in five days. He's expected to be activated by Friday, manager Brian Snitker said. ... RHP Brandon McCarthy (right knee tendinitis) threw a simulated game over the weekend but is not expected to pitch again this season. ... RHP Jose Ramirez (right shoulder inflammation) has been shut down for the rest of the season. ... IF Rio Ruiz was called up from Triple-A Gwinnett.	Giants: INF Ryder Jones (dislocated patella on left knee) will have surgery later this week. The 25-year-old was injured taking a swing during Sunday's game in Milwaukee.	UP NEXT	Braves: RHP Mike Foltynewicz (10-9, 2.75 ERA) is 2/3 with a 5.35 ERA in six career starts against the Giants.	Giants: LHP Andrew Suarez (6-10, 4.33) is tied for 11th in franchise history for a rookie with 118 strikeouts. He ranks seventh in that category in the San Francisco era.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

PHILADELPHIA --  Spencer Kieboom appeared to spit out a tooth before he hit his first major league home run, Erick Fedde pitched shutout ball into the sixth inning and the Washington Nationals beat the fading Philadelphia Phillies 3-1 on Tuesday in the first game of a doubleheader.	The doubleheader was needed once Monday's night's game was postponed because of poor field conditions from weekend rain. The grounds crew used blow torches to dry a field that had not been covered with a tarp and players described as "spongy" and "soft."	It's the Phillies who are stuck in the mud.	The Phillies, who were 15 games over .500 in early August and in the thick of NL playoff race, have lost three straight games and are 6-15 since Aug. 18. They began the day five games behind Atlanta in the NL East.	Kieboom looked as if he spit out a tooth while he walked to the plate before hitting a solo home run in the fifth. He pointed to a gap in his teeth as he jogged back to the dugout.	With 20 active pitchers, Philadelphia manager Gabe Kapler nearly gave them all a turn. The game slowed to a crawl in a four-pitcher fifth.	Nick Pivetta (7-12) gave up Kieboom's solo shot to right and a single to Fedde before he was yanked after one out and 91 pitches. Luis Avilan struck out one batter and was then relieved by Luis Garcia. After a walk, Kapler was at the mound for the hook again, signaling for lefty Adam Morgan to face Bryce Harper.	Harper hit an RBI single to right that made it 2-0, but was tagged out after he made too wide a turn around first and tried to slide back.	Hector Neris started the sixth and worked an inning. Tommy Hunter allowed one run over two innings and Austin Davis tossed a scoreless ninth as the last of seven pitchers.	Fedde, making his second start since he missed two months with a sore right shoulder, tossed one-hit ball through five until he ran into trouble in the sixth. Fedde (2-3) allowed a two-out single and a walk and was relieved by Justin Miller, who retired Andrew Knapp to end the rally.	The late afternoon start resulted in a sparse crowd for the first pitch. The 40-plus-person Phillies contingent in front of the dugout for the national anthem was larger than the bunch of fans in the upper deck.	COMING UP SHORT	The Phillies used four shortstops.	DOUBLE DIP	The Phillies have played four doubleheaders this season, their most since 2011. They've played three at Citizens Bank Park since the All-Star break.	MOVING ON UP	The Phillies recalled RHP Drew Anderson, RHP Enyel De Los Santos and LHP Ranger Suarez from Triple-A Lehigh Valley.

DETROIT --  For five innings, the Houston Astros were one pitch away from blowing an important game.	Their relievers never gave the Tigers that pitch.	Five Houston relievers threw shutout innings, and the Astros' three early homers held up in a 5-4 victory over Detroit on Tuesday night.	"None of those guys had a margin for error," Houston manager A.J. Hinch said.	Houston maintained a three-game lead over the Oakland Athletics in the AL West.	Jose Altuve homered on the first pitch of the game, and the Astros hit two more homers in the first four innings to go up 5-0.	Houston starter Framber Valdez, though, couldn't maintain that big lead.	Valdez allowed four runs in the bottom of the fourth, including a three-run homer by JaCoby Jones. That ended his night and started a parade from the Houston bullpen.	Will Harris (4-3) struck out the side in the fifth, allowing one walk, and Joe Smith pitched a perfect sixth.	Hector Rondon gave up two hits in the seventh but got out of the jam, and Collin McHugh and Roberto Osuna retired the last six batters in order. Osuna struck out rookie Christin Stewart to end the game and earn his 17th save in 18 opportunities.	"It's hard to pick which was my favorite reliever of the night, because they all came in and were effective," Hinch said. "The way the game started, I didn't expect a bullpen day, but I looked up and it was suddenly a one-run game."	Jordan Zimmermann (7-7) allowed five runs on six hits in five innings. He walked one and struck out three.	"I just didn't have my best stuff," he said. "My fastball command wasn't there, so my first pitch wasn't where I wanted it and Altuve's a great hitter. It seems like my starts lately have been very good or very bad."	Detroit got four scoreless innings from its bullpen.	"Those guys did a fantastic job of keeping us in the game," Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire said. "They've got so many great arms in their bullpen, though, and we could never get one more big hit."	After Altuve gave Houston the early lead, Tony Kemp hit a two-run homer in the second inning.	Tyler White hit Houston's third homer, a two-run shot into the Astros bullpen with one out in the fourth.	"We try to get runs any way we can," White said. "Altuve starting the game with a homer was an unbelievable way to get us going, and then Kempie came up with a big swing."	The Tigers scored all their runs with two outs in the fourth. With runners on the corners, Dawel Lugo hit what looked like a routine grounder to short, but the ball took a bad hop and went over Carlos Correa's head for an RBI single.	Jones then lined a 3-1 fastball into the left-field stands for his 11th homer of the season.	"I needed to refocus after the bad hop, because that's something I can't control," Valdez said through a translator. "It's just something that happens."	Jones came into the game hitting .183 with 51 strikeouts in his last 40 games but managed five homers during the slump.	"He can always hit a baseball a long way," Gardenhire said. "The problem comes when he tries to hit home runs. That screws him up, and he starts chasing. When he stays in the strike zone, he's a good hitter."	Houston missed a chance to add to its lead in the seventh.	Louis Coleman hit the first two batters, and a passed ball moved the runners to second and third with one out. Gardenhire intentionally walked Correa, loading the bases, and brought in lefty Daniel Stumpf.	Stumpf got Josh Reddick to pop out and was immediately replaced by right-handed Victor Alcantara. Tyler White hit a hard grounder to third and was originally ruled safe after Jeimer Candelario didn't field the ball cleanly. However, a replay review showed the throw beat White to first, ending the inning.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: Kemp stayed in the game after being hit on the right elbow by a pickoff attempt from Zimmermann. Alex Bregman (leg) and Yuli Gurriel (arm) both needed attention after being hit by Coleman.	UP NEXT	The teams finish the three-game series on Wednesday afternoon with Detroit's Daniel Norris (0-3, 5.47 ERA) facing Houston's Gerrit Cole (13-5, 2.86).	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

CINCINNATI --  Not only did Los Angeles lose to the lowly Cincinnati Reds yet again, this time former Dodgers prospects did in their former team.	Former Los Angeles farmhands Brandon Dixon and Scott Schebler homered, and the Dodgers stumbled for the second straight night in a 3-1 loss Tuesday night.	"Two days ago, things were great," Los Angeles manager Dave Roberts said. "I don't have an answer for the Reds. Obviously, we don't. I wish I had an answer. We felt good about this series coming in. We were prepared. We can't solve the riddle of their pitching. Our only thought now is to salvage the series and find a way to get a win."	Defending NL champion Los Angeles is 0-6 against Cincinnati this season. The Dodgers, who lost Monday's series opener 10-6 to the last-place Reds, remained 1 1/2 games behind NL West-leading Colorado and dropped three games back of St. Louis for the second NL wild card.	Los Angeles has lost back-to-back games for the first time since a three-game sweep by St. Louis from Aug. 20-22. Last week the Dodgers lost two of three to the sub-.500 New York Mets.	"It's not complacency," Roberts said. "If anything, we're trying too hard. When we put it together, we're very good. Against teams that on paper we should beat, it hasn't worked out."	Dixon homered in the second inning and Schebler in the third for a 2-0 lead against Hyun-Jin Ryu (4-3). Jose Peraza, another former Los Angeles prospect, had two hits.	Dixon, Peraza and Schebler all were acquired by the Reds from Los Angeles as part of the December 2015 three-team trade that sent Todd Frazier from Cincinnati to the Chicago White Sox.	"It is fun to play the team you left," Dixon said. "The win is the most important thing, but you have a chip on your shoulder when you play your former team."	Scooter Gennett had two hits, including a run-scoring single in the fifth inning, and lifted his league-leading average to .321. Gennett is hitting .727 (16 for 22) against the Dodgers this season.	Luis Castillo (9-12) allowed one run and four hits in 6 1/3 innings with nine strikeouts. He retired 15 straight batters before Joc Pederson's one-out homer in the sixth.	Raisel Iglesias pitched a hitless ninth for his 26th save in 30 chances, completing a five-hitter.	Dixon, playing in place of a resting Joey Votto, sent a cutter into the upper deck for his fifth home run this season and Schebler hit his 16th home run and third in five games, The drive sailed over the Reds bullpen down the right-field line and clanged off an advertising sign.	Ryu (4-3) gave up eight hits in five innings.	MOVING AROUND	In Cincinnati's last four games, Dixon has started at second base, third base, right field and first base. He is the first Reds player to start four straight games at different positions since Jerry Hairston in September 2008. Dixon also has made two scoreless pitching appearances.	STREAK ALIVE	Pederson's shot extended the Dodgers' streak of consecutive games with at least one homer to 19, tops in the majors this season. Pederson snapped a 0-for-13 skid with a single leading off the game.	GET THE BALL	Reds OF Gabriel Guerrero singled in the fourth for his first major league hit.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: 3B Justin Turner didn't start after reaching base in 33 of 34 games since coming off the disabled list on Aug. 2 but pinch hit. "He's showing signs of fatigue," manager Dave Roberts said. "He's had a high workload."	UP NEXT	Dodgers: RHP Ross Stripling (8-3) starts Wednesday after ace Clayton Kershaw was pushed back to Thursday. Stripling has a 6.14 ERA in 7 1/3 innings in two career appearances against the Reds	Reds: RHP Anthony DeSclafani (7-4) is 1/3 with a 3.12 ERA in four starts against Los Angeles, the last on Aug. 21, 2016.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BALTIMORE --  The acquisition of Mike Fiers has coincided with the Oakland Athletics' surge toward the postseason.	With a pitching staff decimated by injuries, the Athletics will be leaning heavily on the right-hander to help anchor the rotation.	Fiers remained unbeaten in an Oakland uniform, working six solid innings to lead the Athletics past the Baltimore Orioles 3-2 on a damp Tuesday night.	"I feel like if I do my job, I'm going to get a win," Fiers said. "Keeping a team within a couple runs with the way our team is and the way we swing the bats, I find myself in a good chance to win us the game."	Oakland extended its winning streak to five games and is 33-15 since the All-Star break, the best mark in the majors during that span. The Athletics hold the second AL wild-card spot behind the Yankees.	Fiers (12-6), who was acquired from the Tigers on Aug. 6, allowed one run and four hits with seven strikeouts and a walk. He is 5-0 in seven starts with the A's and has won a career-best six straight decisions overall.	"It seems like other than one (start), maybe, that's pretty much what he's been giving us," Oakland manager Bob Melvin said. "Six innings and a lead when he leaves. Seems to get a little stronger at times as the game goes along."	Stephen Piscotty went 3 for 4, including an RBI single in a three-run third inning. He extended his hitting streak to 12 games and has driven in a run in six straight.	"It just seems like every time we need somebody up in a big situation, (Piscotty) comes up and either hits a home run or gets a big hit to extend the lead or whatever it will be," Melvin said.	Adam Jones was back in the starting lineup for the first time since last Wednesday and had a pair of hits for Baltimore, which has lost five straight and has the majors' worst record (41-103). Jonathan Villar drove in both Orioles runs with a homer off Fiers in the sixth and a single in the eighth off Lou Trivino.	Jeurys Familia, acquired from the Mets on July 21, worked a perfect ninth for his 18th save overall.	Orioles right-hander Alex Cobb, who was scratched from his scheduled start Sunday with a blister on his throwing hand, pitched two scoreless innings before departing with the same injury.	"I thought he was on his way to another good outing tonight and he was crisp, carrying a good fastball," manager Buck Showalter said. "He was really frustrated up the runway, regardless of what kind of stuff he might have been carrying and what he could have done."	Mike Wright (3-2) entered in the third and was hit in the left foot by a sharp grounder from Ramon Laureano, the second batter he faced. Matt Chapman followed with an RBI double, and Khris Davis and Piscotty drove in runs with singles.	Wright settled down to retire the next seven batters.	WINNING LATE, WINNING CLOSE	The A's are the only team in baseball that has not lost when leading after seven innings, going 64-0. Oakland is also 28-12 in one-run games, the second-best mark in the majors behind Seattle.	MOVES	Athletics: RHP Frankie Montas was recalled from Triple-A Nashville. Montas has started 11 games for the A's this season, going 5-4 with a 3.96 ERA.	Orioles: OF DJ Stewart had his contract selected from Triple-A Norfolk. His first appearance with the Orioles will be his major league debut. ... RHP Cody Carroll was recalled from Norfolk. He has allowed seven runs and eight hits with nine walks over nine innings with Baltimore this season. ... C Andrew Susac was reinstated from the restricted list.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: LHP Sean Manaea will have season-ending surgery on his left shoulder next week in Los Angeles. Manaea has been on the disabled list since Aug. 26. The 26-year-old Manaea went 12-9 with a 3.59 ERA and 108 strikeouts in 160 2/3 innings this year.	Orioles: OF Mark Trumbo (right knee surgery) and RHP Pedro Araujo (right elbow sprain) were each transferred to the 60-day disabled list.	UP NEXT	Athletics: Liam Hendriks (0-1, 6.32 ERA) is slated to make his third start of the season. He is expected to work an inning or two.	Orioles: Andrew Cashner (4-14, 4.89 ERA) is looking to stop a four-game losing streak. In his last outing, Cashner allowed three solo home runs in a 5-3 loss to the Mariners.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

PHILADELPHIA --  Juan Soto made a leaping catch in foul territory in the first game of a doubleheader and ended eight hours of baseball with a milestone homer in the second game.	Both plays from the talented teen keyed a sensational sweep for the Nationals.	Soto hit a solo home run in the 10th inning, his second of the game, to lead the Washington Nationals to a 7-6 win over the Philadelphia Phillies and a doubleheader sweep on Tuesday night.	"I've never seen a 19 year old swing and be that patient at the plate," Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. "He's 19 but he plays like he's been in the league a long time."	The Nationals rallied for three runs in the ninth inning off Seranthony Dominguez to tie the game at 6-all. Soto, who hit a two-run shot in the fourth, connected off Yacksel Rios (3-2) with one out in the 10th for the winner.	Greg Holland retired the first batters in the 10th before he walked the next two. Holland got Cesar Hernandez to fly out to end the game for his third save. Wander Suero (3-0) got the win.	In the first game, Spencer Kieboom hit his first major league home run after losing a tooth earlier in the day, Erick Fedde pitched shutout ball into the sixth inning and the Nationals beat Phillies 3-1.	The doubleheader was needed once Monday's night's game was postponed because of poor field conditions from weekend rain. The grounds crew used blow torches to dry a field that had not been covered with a tarp and players described as "spongy" and "soft."	It's the Phillies who are stuck in the mud.	The Phillies, who were 15 games over .500 in early August and in the thick of NL playoff race, have lost four straight games and are 6-16 since Aug. 18. Philadelphia fell 6  1/2 games behind Atlanta in the NL East and 6  1/2 games behind St. Louis in the race for the second wild card spot.	The Nationals (73-72) also swept a doubleheader on Saturday and just may pass the slumping Phillies (74-70) in the final standings.	"I'm not going to sugarcoat it. We're not playing good baseball right now," Phillies manager Gabe Kapler said.	The second game ended 8 1/2 hours after the first pitch in the opener -- and with only a smattering of fans at the park each time.	"I feel beat up right now and I just stood there," Martinez said.	The Phillies seemed poised to win the nightcap and get some sort of spark going to stay in the NL playoff picture. They scored five runs in the fourth inning off starter Tanner Roark, and Jose Bautista hit a solo shot in the eighth to make it 6-3.	But Dominguez failed them and Kapler let his closer labor through 43 pitches before pulling him. With 20 active pitchers, Kapler nearly gave them all a turn during the day -- except when Dominguez needed help.	The Phillies loaded the bases in the ninth, but the rally was snuffed when Bautista flied out.	Soto had three hits and four RBI in the nightcap and passed Ken Griffey Jr. for fourth on the career list for homers by a teenager with 18. He also has the most multi-homer games by a teenager in baseball history with three.	"Can't wait to talk to 2-2 over there," Roark said in the Nationals clubhouse.	The Nats had reason to smile -- even if Kieboom, a rookie catcher, was missing a tooth. Kieboom is waiting on veneers and lost half a temporary tooth earlier at breakfast when he bit into a baguette. The other half was stuck in his gums.	He looked as if he spit out a tooth while he walked to the plate in the fifth in the opener. It was just a big spitball. He pointed to the gap as he jogged back to the dugout after the solo homer.	"I just popped it off," he said, laughing. "I've got to roll with this for a little while but that's fine. The Caps, those boys play with no teeth. I can play with no teeth."	Phillies starter Nick Pivetta (7-12) was one of seven pitchers to work the opener.	Fedde (2-3), making his second start since he missed two months with a sore right shoulder, tossed one-hit ball through five.	The late afternoon start resulted in a sparse crowd for the first pitch. The 40-plus-person Phillies contingent in front of the dugout for the national anthem was larger than the bunch of fans in the upper deck.	"One thing that we continue to focus on is who can perform best under sub-optimal conditions," Kapler said. "So optimal conditions are a packed house and really fired up and energetic and suboptimal conditions are when you have more challenging situations. And I think today was a more challenging situation and we always challenge our guys to do the best under those circumstances that they possibly can."	FLIP OUT	Phillies 3B Maikel Franco flipped over a railing and into the dugout chasing down a foul ball in the eighth inning of the nightcap. Franco left the game with a right shoulder contusion and neck soreness.	DOUBLE DIP	The Phillies have played four doubleheaders this season, their most since 2011. They've played three at Citizens Bank Park since the All-Star break.	MOVING ON UP	The Phillies recalled RHP Drew Anderson, RHP Enyel De Los Santos and LHP Ranger Suarez from Triple-A Lehigh Valley.	UP NEXT	It's a doozy: Washington sends RHP Stephen Strasburg (7-7, 4.04 ERA) to the mound against RHP Aaron Nola (16-4, 2.29).	--	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

BOSTON --  The Red Sox became the first team in the major leagues to clinch a playoff berth and did not celebrate.	"Any time you make the playoffs and give yourself a chance to be that last team, it's a pretty special thing," Brock Holt said. "We're excited by that, but we've got more work to do."	Holt pinch hit in the seventh inning and hit a go-ahead, three-run homer in a 7-2 win over the Toronto Blue Jays on Tuesday night that guaranteed Boston no worse than a wild card berth.	At a major league-best 99-46, the Red Sox lead the AL East by nine games with 2 1/2 weeks left. Their postgame celebration was lining up for routine high-fives and heading back to the clubhouse.	"We're in great position to win the division and then to accomplish other things," first-year manager Alex Cora said. "As I told the group, I'm very proud of them."	Starter Chris Sale came off the disabled list and pitched one scoreless inning, striking out two and throwing 26 pitches. Sale has been slowed by inflammation in his left shoulder, and the Red Sox had said they would ease their ace back into action.	"We're taking care of the guy," Cora said.	Boston assured its third straight postseason team, matching the Red Sox teams of 2003-05 and 2007-09.	Ryan Brasier (2-0) pitched 1 1/3 hitless innings as Boston used seven relievers.	Toronto led 2-0 in the seventh, when Steve Pearce hit a tying triple and Holt followed with a two-out home run off Ryan Tepera (5-5).	Kevin Pillar had an RBI single for Toronto during a two-run sixth, when Devon Travis scored the game's first run on a double-steal and botched defensive play by the Red Sox.	STARTERS	Toronto starter Ryan Boruki, who allowed seven runs and eight hits July 13 at Fenway Park, held an opponent to two runs or fewer in at least six innings for the third time in four starts.	"He was tremendous today," manager John Gibbons said. "He's done a tremendous job for a rookie call-up."	NO RUSH	Sale continued tossing in the bullpen after he was pulled, trying to rebuild his arm strength for the postseason. He was hoping to get a second inning, but Cora said it didn't make sense because the Red Sox weren't going to let him throw more than 40 pitches.	"This is the first step in the right direction," Sale said, crediting the Red Sox medical staff. "There was a lot of work by a lot of people that went into this."	MR. CLUTCH	Holt also homered as a pinch hitter on Aug. 13 at Philadelphia.	"I guess I would rather be in there from the start than to come in and pinch-hit," Holt said, "but if I keep on hitting homers then I'll take it."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: RF Randal Grichuk was back in the lineup, two days after he crashed face-first into a guard's metal chair. Concussion tests were negative on Grichuk, who was left with a bloody nose, swollen left eye socket and a few facial cuts. ... Pillar ran face-first into the center field wall chasing Pearce's triple. Pillar needed a few minutes to get back to his feet, but stayed in the game.	Red Sox: Sale made his first start since Aug. 12 and threw 26 pitches. After a leadoff double by Lourdes Gurriel, he struck out two, then walked a batter before Grichuck popped out to end the inning.

NEW YORK --  One of the few teams to have much success against Jacob deGrom all year has been the last-place Miami Marlins.	Go figure.	In his latest hard-luck loss during a record-setting season, deGrom was outpitched by Jose Urena as the Marlins beat the New York Mets 5-3 on Tuesday night.	"These guys, they want to score for him so bad, you can see it," Mets manager Mickey Callaway said. "Unfortunately, we just haven't done that very much."	Locked in a compelling race for the NL Cy Young Award despite his pedestrian record, deGrom (8-9) gave up only Lewis Brinson's two-run double in seven stellar innings. The right-hander allowed three hits and struck out nine , his major league-low ERA climbing just a tick from 1.68 to 1.71.	Even still, he fell to 0-2 in four starts against Miami (57-86), which has won three of those games.	"You just have to scrap for your hits," manager Don Mattingly said. "We just hang in there. I think the games we've been able to beat him, I think our starters have been good."	Urena (6-12) permitted one run and four hits in 6 1/3 innings for the Marlins, who were rained out the previous two days. He is 3-0 with a 2.22 ERA in his last four starts, and 3-0 with a 0.98 ERA in three career starts at Citi Field.	After his outing was pushed back two days because of rain, deGrom held his opponent under four runs for the 26th straight start -- breaking a big league single-season mark set by King Cole in 1910 with the Chicago Cubs.	"I wasn't as comfortable as I normally am. What was I at, eight days or so?" deGrom said. "To go that long without being on the mound, I felt a little off. But I was able to kind of correct myself as the game went on."	In a recurring theme, however, the Mets didn't provide much help. All they could muster at the plate was Michael Conforto's solo homer off Urena and Kevin Plawecki's two-run shot against Drew Steckenrider with two outs in the ninth.	Conforto has homered in three consecutive games for the first time in his career.	JT Riddle came off the bench and homered into the second deck in right field in his first at-bat for Miami since returning from a sore left wrist.	"Those two rainouts really helped. Got me two extra days to rest," he said. "It felt really good, especially being off a week now."	After missing five games, Riddle connected in the eighth against reliever Anthony Swarzak, who made his first major league appearance since Aug. 3. The right-hander was recently activated from the disabled list after missing time with shoulder inflammation.	Miami got three straight hits off Robert Gsellman to start the ninth, including an RBI triple by Brian Anderson and Derek Dietrich's run-scoring double.	A resurgent Brinson doubled off the center-field fence with two outs in the fourth. After that, deGrom set down his final 10 batters and finished the night with 239 strikeouts, equaling the career high he set last season.	"I think you kind of understand that you're only going to have a couple opportunities off a guy like him," Anderson said. "Usually it's one or two a game. And he's really good at shutting down those opportunities. I think with runners in scoring position, guys are hitting under .100 off of him. Having a guy like Lewis come in there and get that hit against him, and with two strikes, really helped our morale and really got us going there."	Mets third baseman Todd Frazier was ejected after the sixth by plate umpire Dan Bellino.	MAKING STRIDES	Brinson is batting .400 (12 for 30) with a homer, three doubles and six RBI since coming off the disabled list Sept. 1. He has upped his season average to .206.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: RHP Dan Straily (strained left oblique) felt discomfort while throwing for the first time since leaving his last start. He could miss the rest of the season, Mattingly said.	Mets: 3B David Wright took live batting practice on the field as the Mets' captain tries to complete his comeback from a string of debilitating injuries.	UP NEXT	A single-admission doubleheader Wednesday to make up Monday's rainout. RHP Trevor Richards (3-8, 4.73 ERA) and RHP Jeff Brigham (0-1, 9.00) are the scheduled Miami starters, with RHP Zack Wheeler (10-7, 3.39) and LHP Jason Vargas (5-9, 6.75) set to go for the Mets.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Josh Donaldson and Edwin Encarnacion are back together again and got a chance to celebrate a home run like old times in Toronto.	Donaldson went hitless in his Cleveland debut, Encarnacion reached 30 homers for the seventh straight season and the Indians beat the Tampa Bay Rays 2-0 on Tuesday night.	Donaldson was on-deck when Encarnacion went deep and the pair exchanged a high-five afterward.	"We try and have fun out there," Encarnacion said. "It's good to have him back in the same lineup together."	Cleveland lowered its magic number to three for a third straight AL Central title. Second-place Minnesota was hosting the New York Yankees.	Acquired from Toronto on Aug. 31, Donaldson went 0 for 4 in his first big league game since May 28, a layoff caused by a strained left calf. The 2015 AL MVP flied out to deep center and deep right, struck out and grounded into a forceout. The third baseman made a nifty backhand grab on C.J. Cron's sixth-inning grounder.	"He looked to me like Donaldson," Indians manager Terry Francona said. "He took some ferocious swings, and he was on so many pitches. He squared up a couple and had nothing to show for it. He's got time and it gets exciting."	Jose Ramirez moved from third to second, and second baseman Jason Kipnis moved to center.	Yan Gomes also homered and rookie Shane Bieber (10-3) struck out a career-high 11 in 6 2/3 innings, allowing three hits and three walks.	Tampa Bay had its franchise record 12-game home winning streak end and lost for just the fourth time in 21 games overall.	The Rays dropped to 8  1/2 games behind Oakland for the second AL wild card with 18 games remaining. The teams will meet in a three-game series this weekend.	"The odds are against us but I'm very excited," Rays ace Blake Snell said. "This team is special."	Gomes homered in the fifth and Encarnacion in the sixth against Tyler Glasnow (0-4), who allowed six hits in seven innings.	Encarnacion, Ramirez (37) and Francisco Lindor (34) are the fifth trio of Indians to reach 30 homers in the same season.	"It's unbelievable, something I never expected to happen," Encarnacion said of his streak. "I'm proud of what I've been doing."	Bieber allowed three hits and three walks. Brad Hand relieved with two on and two outs in the seventh, walked pinch-hitter Matt Duffy, then fell behind Mallex Smith 3-0 before getting him to pop out on a full-count pitch.	"That was rough for about eight pitches but he fights his way back," Francona said.	Cody Allen pitched a one-hit ninth, completing a four-hitter for his 27th save in 32 chances.	Tampa Bay's Tommy Pham singled in the first and has a career-best 15-game hitting streak.	Rays manager Kevin Cash was ejected in the eighth for arguing a balk called on Vidal Nuno.	SETTING UP THE ACE	The Indians will skip 18-game winner Corey Kluber's start this weekend to give him a couple extra days off to get lined up for the playoffs.	NUMEBRS	Bieber is 6-0 in 10 road starts. ... Cleveland pitchers have 29 strikeouts, including 13 Tuesday, through the first two games of the series.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: RHP Trevor Bauer (right fibula stress fracture) is to throw off a bullpen mound Wednesday. ... RHP Cody Anderson (right elbow surgery) made 27 pitches over two-thirds of an inning for Double-A Akron against New Hampshire in Game 1 of the Eastern League Championship Series.	Rays: CF Kevin Kiermaier (illness) was out of the lineup for the second consecutive game but was in the on-deck circle when the game ended. ... RHP Jose Mujica had Tommy John surgery.	UP NEXT	Indians: RHP Carlos Carrasco (16-8) starts Wednesday.	Rays: Snell (18-5) seeks to take over the big league lead in wins after going 5-7 last season. "It's amazing how much better he's gotten in one year," Francona said.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

MINNEAPOLIS --  Though the New York Yankees remain on pace to reach the 100-win mark, the threat of being forced to take a cross-country trip for a one-and-done postseason game sure has not disappeared.	This rare lopsided loss to the Minnesota Twins sure didn't help.	Joe Mauer hit a grand slam to highlight a six-run fifth inning, and the Twins beat the Yankees for the first time in 10 meetings, a 10-5 victory on Tuesday night after another flop by Sonny Gray as a starter.	"We've got to do better. We go out and lay an egg like that," manager Aaron Boone said, trailing off. "This is the time where we've got to start playing up to our capabilities and putting our best foot forward every single day."	Didi Gregorius answered Mauer's big bop with his own slam in the sixth. That was the only bright spot for the Yankees, who dropped nine games behind Boston in the AL East race and had their lead over Oakland for the first wild card spot cut to two games. The Athletics won their fifth straight game.	"Can't control what's going on over there," Gregorius said. "Can only control what's going over here."	The major league leaders in home runs with 234, the Yankees fell to 80-36 in games when they go deep. They grounded into three double plays and had only five hits, none after Gregorius hit his second grand slam against the Twins this year.	"We've got to dig down right now and find it," Boone said, "and try and lock in and get this thing rolling the right way."	Gray was dropped from the rotation in early August with an 8-8 record and 5.56 ERA. He pitched more aggressively in four relief appearances, then returned to the rotation for a spot start and took a shutout into the seventh inning at Baltimore on Aug. 25. He made one more relief appearance and was given the start against the Twins to allow the rotation an extra day of rest.	Gray (10-9) lasted three innings and allowed three runs -- two earned -- with four hits and three walks.	"You walk guys," Gray said, "and it will kill you."	The right-hander refused to acknowledge any added frustration from stumbling in his now-rare opportunity to start. Neither did he allow for any increased pressure the team might be feeling from the A's, his former team.	"We lost one game. We're fine," Gray said. "I feel like everyone's in good spirits."	MAUER POWER	Gregorius tripled and scored on Gary Sanchez's sacrifice fly for a second-inning lead, and Gray gave it back in a three-run third fueled by a two-run single by former Yankees farmhand Jake Cave. Jonathan Loaisiga fared even worse, forcing in a run with a bases-loaded walk to Max Kepler in the fifth.	Boone appeared to argue with plate umpire James Hoye that the third ball to Kepler actually grazed his bat for a foul ball. Three batters later, Mauer crushed a full-count fastball to center field where it landed in the berm beyond the wall. He came out for a curtain call after his fifth career grand slam, tying Tony Oliva for fourth place in Twins history with 597 extra-base hits.	"He's just got that ability to not let emotion or moments overtake his ability to perform," manager Paul Molitor said.	The Yankees are 96-34 against the Twins, including the playoffs, and have won every season series since the start of 2002. They outscored the Twins 66-23 over the nine-game winning streak that ended.	"It's always nice to beat those guys," Mauer said, "I'll tell you that."	THE OPENER	Kohl Stewart (1-1) earned his first major league victory despite walking five batters in 3 1/3 innings. He followed reliever Tyler Duffey, who pitched two innings as a bullpen opener in the latest experiment by the Twins with a new trend that Tampa Bay started. This was their first win in three tries with the arrangement.	"I'm not saying it's right or wrong, I'm just saying it's different," Duffey said. "It worked today. If it works the next time around or doesn't, who knows?"	DON'T JUDGE	Yankees right fielder Aaron Judge missed his 44th game after being hit by a pitch that broke his right wrist, but for the second straight afternoon he put on a powerful batting practice display in addition to some defensive drills. Boone declined to divulge a specific timeline for Judge's return to the lineup, but the manager is clearly eager for that to occur. More clarity will come after Judge's workouts this weekend at Yankee Stadium, Boone said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: With Boone preferring Austin Romine as the backstop for Gray, Sanchez moved from behind the plate to take a turn as the DH.	Twins: Tyler Austin was the DH for the Twins, after a four-game absence because of back tightness. Traded by the Yankees to the Twins on July 30 for right-hander Lance Lynn, Austin made his first appearance against his original team. He singled and walked in five plate appearances.	UP NEXT	Yankees: RHP Luis Severino (17-7, 3.52 ERA) will pitch the last game of the series, coming off his shortest turn of the season with six hits and six runs allowed in 2 2/3 innings in a loss at Oakland last week. After an off day on Thursday, Masahiro Tanaka, C.C. Sabathia and Lynn will be the weekend starters against Toronto.	Twins: RHP Jake Odorizzi (5-10, 4.57 ERA) will take the mound on Wednesday night, reaching the 30-start mark for the third time in five years.	---	For more AP MLB coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

CHICAGO --  Jose Quintana dazzled all night long.	The Chicago Cubs had the right guy on the mound for a big game against the Milwaukee Brewers.	Quintana pitched three-hit ball into the seventh inning, Victor Caratini drove in two runs and the Cubs beat the Brewers 3-0 on Tuesday to regain their two-game lead in the NL Central.	Quintana (13-9) continued his mastery of Milwaukee in a huge spot, improving to 6-2 with a 1.60 ERA in 10 career starts against the Brewers. The veteran left-hander struck out seven and walked two in 6 2/3 innings in his second straight victory over Jhoulys Chacin, also winning at Milwaukee last Wednesday.	"He always throws well, it seems, against the Brewers," manager Joe Maddon said.	Quintana received a standing ovation from the crowd of 37,017 when he departed with the bases loaded after a replay review awarded an infield single to pinch-hitter Hernan Perez. Justin Wilson then struck out pinch-hitter Manny Pina on three pitches, preserving Chicago's 2-0 lead and drawing another loud roar at Wrigley Field.	Jorge De La Rosa pitched a perfect eighth and Pedro Strop finished the three-hitter for his 13th save in 17 chances. Shortstop Addison Russell made an outstanding backhanded stop to retire Ryan Braun for the second out of the ninth, drawing a jaw-dropping reaction from teammate David Bote at third base.	"My goodness," Maddon said.	Milwaukee (83-63) had won seven of eight, including a 3-2 victory in the series opener that trimmed Chicago's division lead to one game. Chacin (14-7) pitched five innings of one-hit ball, but some sloppy play in the second proved costly for the wild card-leading Brewers.	Ben Zobrist led off with a grounder that skipped by second baseman Jonathan Schoop for an error. With one out and runners on second and third, Chacin threw the ball into center field in an apparent miscommunication with shortstop Orlando Arcia while trying to pick off Javier Baez at second.	"I got a sinker on my hand and just the ball sailed a bit more," Chacin said. "But like I said, I was trying to set up the pickoff there and was just waiting for Arcia to get on the base."	Zobrist scored on Chacin's error and the Brewers brought their infield in with Caratini at the plate. The backup catcher then hit a soft liner on the 10th pitch of his at-bat that went off the glove of a leaping Schoop for an RBI single.	Caratini added a run-scoring double against Brandon Woodruff in the seventh, providing some sorely needed production at the bottom of Chicago's lineup. It was Caratini's first game since he had three hits and four RBI in a doubleheader at Washington on Saturday.	"I felt really good up there," Caratini said through a translator. "I was just trying to have quality at-bats and luckily I had really good results."	Quintana threw 108 pitches, 68 for strikes. He is 3-0 with a 1.84 ERA in his last five outings overall.	"We've been unable to solve him for sure," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said.	STATISTICALLY SPEAKING	Brewers star Christian Yelich reached safely for the 27th straight game when he walked in the fourth. It's the longest active streak in the NL and matches his career high set in 2014.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: LHP Jon Lester, who left his start on Monday night with lower back tightness, said he didn't feel great on Tuesday, but he didn't think he would miss any time. If the Cubs are rained out Thursday in Washington -- the forecast is a bit dicey -- they could adjust their rotation to provide more rest for Lester. ... OF Kyle Schwarber (back) was unavailable. ... RHP Brandon Morrow (right biceps inflammation) is scheduled for another bullpen session on Wednesday. "One moment at a time, try to evaluate it afterwards and see where we're at," Maddon said.	UP NEXT	Brewers RHP Chase Anderson (9-7, 3.95 ERA) and Cubs RHP Kyle Hendricks (11-10, 3.71 ERA) pitch in the series finale on Wednesday night. Anderson is unbeaten in his last nine starts, going 3-0 with a 4.34 ERA since his last loss on July 14 at Pittsburgh. Hendricks is 2-0 with a 1.00 ERA over his last three outings.	---	Jay Cohen can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/jcohenap	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Brad Keller had another effective outing to keep up his impressive rookie season.	Keller pitched seven strong innings to win for the fourth time in six starts, leading the Kansas City Royals to a 6-3 win over the Chicago White Sox on Tuesday night.	"He kind of struggled with his mechanics a little bit early, but he's a kid who doesn't give in," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "He comes right at you with good stuff. ... He got pitches to get outs when he needed to."	Keller (8-6) gave up one run and four hits and two walks while striking out six. He is 4-1 with a 1.62 ERA in his last six starts, lowering his ERA to 3.04 -- leading all AL rookies.	Yost isn't quite ready to talk about Keller in the Rookie Of The Year discussion, but it's not too far from his mind.	"I haven't paid attention to who his competition will be," he said. "I'm very proud and pleased with the year that he's put together. ... He's only going to get better."	Keller says it's an honor to be in the discussion of top rookies, but it's not his focus.	"I don't really look at that," Keller said. "I just try to go out and help the team win. It's just cool to be in the talks, but that doesn't matter."	Whit Merrifield had two hits, two RBI, and scored two runs for the Royals. He also stole two bases to increase his American League lead to 33 steals, including a league-best 12 of third base.	The aggressiveness on the basepaths, especially since the All-Star break, has been key in the Royals starting to play better at home. They have 47 steals in 48 games since the break.	"We have to force the issue at times," Merrifield said, "be aggressive and good things happen."	Wily Peralta picked up his 10th save in 10 chances, despite walking two in 1/3 of an inning.	The Royals have won a season-high seven straight at home -- and 10 of 11. After starting 11-35 at home before the All-Star break, the Royals are 16-10 since the break. They need to win three of their final nine games to avoid tying the franchise's worst home record (1998).	Dylan Covey (5-13) allowed six runs -- five earned -- and six hits in 4 1/3 innings for the White Sox. He walked three and struck out four. He is now 0-6 with a 9.00 ERA in his last six starts. Over his last 11 outings, he's 1-9 with an 8.59 ERA.	Covey has struggled against the Royals, falling to 0-7 with a 6.37 ERA in nine career starts.	The White Sox scored a run in the third when Avasail Garcia beat out an infield single, scoring Yolmer Sanchez from third. Garcia rolled it sharply to short, but Adalberto Mondesi appeared to take too long to release the throw to first.	Mondesi made up for his gaffe with an RBI single as part of a three-run third for Kansas City. Merrifield blooped a single to short right field, scoring Brian Goodwin. Mondesi followed with a bunt single that scored Rosell Herrera. A bad throw by catcher Welington Castillo sent Merrifield to third. He scored on Alex Gordon's sacrifice fly to the wall in right.	The Royals added another run in the fourth. Ryan O'Hearn led off with a triple down the right-field line and scored on Jorge Bonifacio's ground-rule double to make it 4-1.	Hunter Dozier had a two-run single in the sixth to give the Royals a five-run lead.	The White Sox pulled within three in the ninth against Royals relievers, with Tim Anderson driving in Ryan LaMarre with a single and Yoan Moncada scoring Jose Rondon on a bases-loaded walk.	"We had some opportunities early, didn't cash them in," Chicago manager Rick Renteria said. "And then, we gave them a little scare here in the ninth."	JONES RETURNS	Prior to Tuesday's game, the White Sox returned RHP Nate Jones from his rehab assignment with Class A Winston-Salem, and reinstated him from the 60-day disabled list. He was placed on the disabled list June 13 with a pronator muscle strain in his right arm. He's 2-2 and a 2.55 ERA in 27 relief appearances. Jones pitched a scoreless seventh inning against the Royals.	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox: OF Leury Garcia remains on the disabled list with a grade-2 left hamstring. "Doing better," Renteria said. "(He's getting) a little more activity. He's still feeling some soreness, some tightness when he's doing certain things."	Royals: OF Brett Phillips, who has been out since suffering a right shoulder contusion last Wednesday in Cleveland, continues to improve, according to Yost. Phillips took 30 more swings off the tee Tuesday. "I still don't have a definite date (for his return)," Yost said before the game. "But he's getting closer."	UP NEXT	White Sox LHP Carlos Rodon (6-5, 3.11 ERA) will face Royals LHP Eric Skoglund (1-5, 6.45). Rodon has lost his two starts in September after the Sox won all five of his August starts (he was 3-0 in those starts). Skoglund missed more than three months of the season (86 games) with a strained left UCL. He has pitched two scoreless innings out of the bullpen since his return. He made five rehab starts, going 0-1 with a 3.54 ERA  with three different minor league affiliates.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ST. LOUIS --  Miles Mikolas was feeling fresh for St. Louis, and that was bad news for the Pittsburgh Pirates.	Cardinals rookie Tyler O'Neill hit a three-run homer during a six-run eighth inning, Marcell Ozuna drove in three and Mikolas pitched seven solid innings after an extra day off to lift the Cardinals over the Pirates 11-5 on Tuesday night.	"The extra day is big at this point in the season," Mikolas said. "Gives you an extra day to push back a lift or take that breather and get some stuff done at your own pace and not try to crunch running and lifting and throwing and treatment and this and that in a day. It allows you to space it out and it takes a mental burden off you."	Mikolas (15-5) gave up a run, five hits and a walk while striking out seven with 107 pitches. He dropped his ERA to 2.99, and he got his first victory in five starts against the Pirates this season.	"I thought he was fantastic," Cardinals manager Mike Shildt said. "He threw strikes for effect. His secondary pitches were hitting. He did a really, really nice job. It was a quality outing. Miles has been pretty good every time he's toed the rubber."	Mikolas struck out five straight in one stretch, and the Cardinals improved to 21-8 in his starts.	Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle was impressed with Mikolas, who signed with St. Louis before this season following three years in Japan.	"He shows up, makes pitches and he competes," Hurdle said. "For him to get the depth he got after a couple of situations we had him in early was impressive. ... We jacked his pitch count up and he was able to put his foot down when he needed to."	Ozuna is hitting .352 this season against Pittsburgh. He has 13 RBI against the Pirates and 79 on the season.	Since coming off the disabled list for his balky right shoulder, Ozuna has been hot.	He extended his hitting streak to seven games (13 for 30, .433). It was his team-leading 20th game with multiple RBI this season.	"I feel better, God bless," Ozuna said. "I'm better in my approach and having success. I'm way better."	Joe Musgrove (6-9) went six innings. He allowed four hits, four runs and two walks while striking out eight.	St. Louis took a 2-0 lead in the first when Ozuna hit a two-run double to left, scoring Matt Carpenter and Jose Martinez.	"That was a missile to left to get us started," Shildt said.	Corey Dickerson countered for Pittsburgh with an RBI single in the fourth before St. Louis added two runs in the sixth after loading the bases with no outs. After Ozuna struck out, Musgrove threw a wild pitch to score Carpenter. Paul DeJong hit a sacrifice fly to center, driving in Martinez for a 4-1 lead.	A wild pitch by Pirates reliever Tanner Anderson with the bases load in the seventh let Francisco Pena score.	Then St. Louis blew it open in the eighth. Pena singled home Kolten Wong from second base, and O'Neill then hit a 3-0 pitch 457 feet into the upper left field bleachers for his eighth home run. The shot knocked out rookie pitcher Nick Burdi, who was making his major league debut.	Pinch-hitter Adolis Garcia added a run-scoring double off Clay Holmes, and Ozuna finished off the St. Louis scoring with a sacrifice fly. It was the first career RBI and extra-base hit for Garcia.	The Pirates scored four runs and five hits in the ninth off Luke Weaver. John Brebbia relieved to record the final out.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cardinals: Activated P Mike Mayers (right shoulder inflammation) from the 10-day disabled list. He had been out since Aug. 26. ... C Yadier Molina missed his fifth straight game with left hamstring tightness. He is day to day. ... 3B Jedd Gyorko (left groin strain) is expected to be activated Thursday.	UP NEXT	Pirates: RHP Jameson Taillon (12-9, 3.40) make his career-high 29th start. He had made 18 straight starts allowing three earned runs or fewer. He is 2-1 with a 3.57 ERA in seven career starts against St. Louis.	Cardinals: RHP Daniel Poncedeleon (0-1, 2.67) will make his fourth start of the season and it will be his first appearance against the Pirates. He pitched two innings of scoreless relief Saturday in Detroit.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

DENVER --  Ketel Marte was told his playing time would decrease. A struggling bullpen was informed their roles would be juggled.	They responded in a big way.	Marte drove in four runs, including a two-out, two-run triple to break a sixth-inning tie, reliever Yoshihisa Hirano helped Arizona weather a ninth-inning scare for his first big league save and the Diamondbacks pulled closer in the NL West standings by beating the first-place Colorado Rockies 6-3 on Tuesday night.	The Diamondbacks cut their deficit in the division to 2 1/2 games. The Rockies maintained a 1 1/2 -game advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers, who lost for a second straight day in Cincinnati. Colorado is chasing after its first NL West crown in franchise history.	"We needed to win a game," said reliever Brad Ziegler, whose team stopped a three-game skid. "It doesn't matter how it happens as long as we walk away happy at the end of the night."	With Marte, the plan is to use the Daniel Descalso a little more down the stretch. Marte made his case to remain in the lineup with his league-leading 11th triple. He also added a two-run single in the eighth for a 6-3 lead.	"I'll be ready whenever they need me," Marte said.	As for the bullpen, it's been altered after some struggles of late.	"They kind of said from about the sixth inning on, everybody be ready at any point," Ziegler explained.	Zack Greinke (14-9) gave up two runs in the first before recovering his command to allow three runs in 6 2/3 innings. He retired 15 straight batters at one point as he beat the Rockies for a third time this season.	Pinch-hitter Matt Holliday nearly tied the game at 4 in the seventh off Greinke, with his two-out double to right-center hitting off the top of the wall. That would've been a homer in his first stint with the Rockies, but team the raised the wall in 2016.	Andrew Chafin relieved Greinke and walked two straight. He was replaced by Brad Ziegler, who retired DJ LeMahieu on a groundout. Ziegler also bottled up the Rockies in the eight.	Jake Diekman started the ninth, only to surrender a double to Carlos Gonzalez and a bunt single to Ryan McMahon. Hirano struck out two straight, then retired Charlie Blackmon on a flyout.	"We had a lot of chances. Tonight we didn't get the big hit," Rockies manager Bud Black said. "They made some pitches when they needed to."	Antonio Senzatela (4-6) gave up two runs in the first and four runs total over six innings. The Rockies pitching staff has a 7.75 ERA in the opening frame.	Senzatela was cruising along until two outs in the sixth when he thought he threw strike three to end a harmless inning. Paul Goldschmidt took the pitch for a ball and followed with a double. A.J. Pollock reached on an infield single, and Marte lined a changeup past a diving McMahon at first to make 4-2.	Greinke masterfully varied speeds and pitches all night to keep the Rockies off balance. A sample: He struck out McMahon on a 90 mph fastball, Tony Wolters on a 83 mph slider and both Trevor Story and Carlos Gonzalez on curves ranging from 65-to-67 mph.	"You just never know what you're going to get," Story said. "He just keeps hitters off balance."	EXPLOSIVE FIRST	David Peralta hit a two-run homer in the first that landed in the trees over the fence in straightaway center. Colorado answered as Blackmon doubled to lead off the first. Nolan Arenado and Story both delivered RBI doubles.	THIS & THAT	Goldschmidt finished 1 for 3 with a walk to extend his streak of reaching base in road games to 47 straight. ... Greinke struck out five to reach 2,421 and move one ahead of Max Scherzer for 43rd place. ... Story has 100 RBI to become the second major league shortstop with at least 30 homers, 100 RBI and 25 stolen bases in a season. Story joins Alex Rodriguez.	UP NEXT	The Diamondbacks send LHP Patrick Corbin (11-9, 3.01) to the mound Wednesday against the Rockies. He's 6-1 with a 2.33 ERA against the division this season. The Rockies will throw righty Jon Gray (11-7, 4.69), who is 4-0 with a 3.17 ERA since being recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  The Los Angeles Angels nearly came through with a no-hitter in a bullpen game.	However, Blake Parker gave up Isiah Kiner-Falefa's single to right with one out in the eighth inning for Texas' first hit and the Angels held on for a 1-0 victory over the Rangers on Tuesday night.	"I left that ball up to Isiah Kiner-Falefa," Parker said. "If I get that down, it's probably a ground ball."	The Angels' starting rotation was decimated by injuries this season, paving the way for what was the fifth bullpen game of the season. Jim Johnson made his second career start and pitched 1 1/3 innings. He was followed by Noe Ramirez, Hansel Robles, Cam Bedrosian, Justin Anderson and Jose Alvarez, who combined to get through seven innings without giving up a hit.	Parker found difficulty in the eighth. After Kiner-Falefa's single to break up the bid, he got pinch hitter Ronald Gumzan to fly out to left field, then allowed a sharp single by Rougned Odor. Scioscia opted to change pitchers, and those two hits would be all the Rangers could muster. The Angels got out of the inning on a nice defensive play at third base by Kaleb Cowart with runners on second and third.	"(Odor) was out front a little bit and he got some good wood on it and it fell in," Parker said. "I was glad (Ty) Buttrey came in and nailed that down for us and kept us in it."	As he walked off the mound, Parker looked to the sky and smacked his hand lightly in his glove in obvious disappointment he wasn't able to keep the no-hitter going.	Ramirez (5-5) got the win, and Buttrey earned the save.	"They made some great plays behind their pitchers, and I thought their pitchers did a heck of a job retiring 12 in a row at one point," Rangers manager Jeff Banister said. "We had a couple opportunities early but couldn't cash in. We stayed in the game well. During the eighth, we gave ourselves an opportunity."	Jose Fernandez hit his first career home run for the Angels in the second inning, adding another milestone to the 30-year-old Cuban's rookie season after making his major league debut June 8.	"I feel very proud of what I accomplished and helped the team to win," Fernandez said through a translator. "I'm very happy to be here. It's a great moment."	Catcher Joe Hudson made his major league debut for the Angels, calling a game for eight pitchers in a shutout and near milestone game.	Hudson obviously knew the no-hitter was on the line, and he figured it would happen as the game wore on.	"I'd be lying if I told you no," he said. "I had a good feeling we'd get through it after the seventh. Almost."	Adrian Sampson (0-1) made his first start for the Rangers this season and second career start. His last previous start was with Seattle in 2016, but his career went off track when warming up for what was supposed to be his second start with the Mariners. He was injured, had to have surgery to repair a torn flexor tendon and worked his way back.	Sampson allowed Fernandez's homer among two hits in five innings.	Fernandez got the silent treatment from his teammates when he walked through the dugout, arms outstretched looking for teammates to high-five. When he got to the end of the dugout, Mike Trout splashed him in the face with a cup of water.	"He actually said that a few days ago so I was expecting that," Fernandez said. "He wanted my first home run to be celebrated that way, throwing water on my face."	ANGELS BULLPEN GAMES ARE A THING	The eight pitchers used in a nine-inning shutout ties the major league record last done by the Angels on Aug. 30, 2014, against Oakland.	LAST NO-NO	Jered Weaver threw the last no-hitter for the Angels on May 2, 2012, against Minnesota.	LONG TIME BETWEEN STARTS	Johnson made his last start in his major league debut with Baltimore in 2006. He made 666 relief appearances between starts.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: RHP Nick Tropeano (right shoulder inflammation) will have a plate-rich plasma injection Friday and after 10 days begin his rehab program. He will not return this season.	UP NEXT	Rangers: RHP Yovani Gallardo (8-4, 6.22 ERA) is 1/3 over his last five starts after a 7-1 stretch before that. He faced the Angels once this year, allowing two runs on six hits in six innings but was not involved in the decision of the Rangers' 4-2 win Aug. 19.	Angels: RHP Felix Pena (2-4, 4.04 ERA) got the win in his last start Friday after allowing two runs in seven innings with six strikeouts and no walks in Chicago He makes his first career appearance against the Rangers and 15th start of the season.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

SEATTLE --  The Mariners' offensive woes have been the chief culprit for their fall from AL playoff contention. Those struggles showed up again Tuesday night, only furthering Seattle's fade from the wild-card race.	Wil Myers lined an RBI double off major league saves leader Edwin Diaz with one out in the ninth inning, lifting the San Diego Padres to a 2-1 win and dropping the Mariners 8 1/2 games back in the race for the second AL wild card.	The Mariners only have 18 games left after losing to the Padres for the third time in the past month. It was the 11th time since July 1 the Mariners scored one run or fewer. Not surprisingly, they dropped to 1-10 in those games.	"Story of tonight, just our lack of offensive production. We haven't done much at all swinging the bats against San Diego this year," Seattle manager Scott Servais.	While Seattle's hitters failed to come through with scoring chances, Myers got the better of the best closer in baseball this season. Myers lined an RBI double off Diaz to snap the 1-1 tie.	Diaz (0-4) struggled without having a chance at his 55th save and left pitches up. He gave up singles to Hunter Renfroe and Eric Hosmer leading off the inning. After a strikeout of Franmil Reyes, Myers jumped on the first pitch and pulled it into the left field corner, letting pinch-runner Travis Jankowski score easily from second.	It was just the second inning all night the Padres put multiple runners on base, but they were able to capitalize on their opportunity unlike the Mariners.	"To be able to get something going off a guy like that is pretty tough," Myers said. "I think it's pretty cool that we can sit back and say we got to arguably the best closer in the game. You take some confidence in that."	Seattle was 1 for 6 with runners in scoring position and missed on chances to take the lead in both the seventh and eighth innings. Kirby Yates pitched the ninth inning for his eighth save.	Seattle had runners at second and third and no outs in the seventh and failed to score, and loaded the bases with two outs in the eighth inning and failed to score again. Cameron Maybin, who doubled in the seventh, couldn't come through in the eighth against Craig Stammen (8-2), flying out to the warning track in right to end the threat.	"In those situations, you've got to get your pitch to hit, and we didn't do anything with it," Servais said.	Robinson Cano's solo home run in the third inning was Seattle's only run.	STARTING OFF	Marco Gonzales pitched well in his first start off the disabled list for Seattle. Gonzales lost four straight decisions before going on the disabled list with a muscle strain in his neck on Aug. 27. In all four starts, he allowed at least four earned runs. In two of the starts he was knocked around for seven and eight earned runs.	Gonzales was on a limited pitch count but made the most of his five innings, allowing just four hits and one run before departing after 66 pitches. He struck out two and limited any damage to Reyes' RBI infield single in the fourth inning.	"I just started to throw across my body a little more so mechanically made a little adjustment and cleaned up some things that showed tonight," Gonzales said. "I thought I had some life on my pitches."	San Diego starter Bryan Mitchell was even better. Making his second start after missing four months due to an elbow injury, Mitchell allowed four hits over six innings. His lone mistake was the changeup he left up in the zone that Cano hit out to center field. Mitchell retired 10 of the final 11 batters he faced.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: Rookie 2B Luis Urias injured his left hamstring to beat out a grounder in the eighth inning. Urias pulled up just before he reached first base and had to be helped back to the San Diego dugout.	CALL UPS	Padres: San Diego added infielder Javy Guerra and pitchers Kazuhisa Makita, Colten Brewer and Brad Wieck to its active roster. Manager Andy Green said Guerra would get some time at shortstop in the closing weeks.	Mariners: Seattle's expanding roster added right-handers Matt Festa and Nick Rumbelow from Double-A Arkansas, along with reinstating Gonzales from the DL. Rumbelow and Festa both had brief stints with the Mariners earlier in the season. Seattle now has 38 players on its active roster.	UP NEXT	Padres: Lefty Joey Lucchesi (7-8) will make his 23rd start of his rookie season. Lucchesi allowed one run over 6 2/3 innings in a victory over Seattle last month.	Mariners: Lefty Wade LeBlanc (8-3) will make his 23rd start and has not allowed an earned run in his last 18 innings pitched. LeBlanc has thrown at least six innings in his last three starts.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

SAN FRANCISCO --  Mike Foltynewicz has minimal experience pitching in meaningful September games, so saving the Braves bullpen and going the distance as NL East-leading Atlanta gained separation in the division meant so much at this stage.	Foltynewicz pitched a six-hitter to win for the first time in nearly a month, Charlie Culberson hit a two-run homer after entering as an injury replacement and the Braves sent the San Francisco Giants to a 10th straight defeat with a 4-1 win Tuesday night.	"It's just really good to go out there and put up a game like this against these guys in the middle of September," Foltynewicz said. "This is kind of my first time really pitching in September. Just going out there, I felt strong the whole game. It's in the playoff race. Not too many of us are used to that. We're just taking it day by day, pitch by pitch and we're having a lot of fun doing it, too."	Foltynewicz (11-9) retired 13 straight batters after Evan Longoria's two-out double in the first. The right-hander carried a shutout into the ninth before allowing Brandon Crawford's two-out RBI single.   Atlanta's starter struck out seven and walked one while finishing with 108 pitches. He was still hitting the high 90s on the radar gun in the late innings.	It marked Foltynewicz's first victory since Aug. 13 against Miami, ending a four-start winless stretch during which he was 0-2 following a three-start winning streak.	Dansby Swanson added an RBI double in the eighth for the Braves, who moved 6 1/2 games ahead of the Phillies in the division.	Ender Inciarte had a sacrifice fly in the fourth then Culberson followed Ronald Acuna Jr.'s leadoff triple in the fifth with his 11th home run. He replaced injured third baseman Johan Camargo, who exited with left groin tightness.	"Charlie's been doing that all year. Somebody goes down, he just steps in and does a great job," manager Brian Snitker said.	The Giants have just their third double-digit losing streak since moving West in 1958 -- also in 1985 and 1996 -- and sixth since 1908. The club's last 11-game skid was in 1951, when the New York Giants went on to win an NL pennant.	San Francisco held a brief team meeting Tuesday.	"I think they'll get through this and play better the last 16 games. We have to," manager Bruce Bochy said. "We can't get any worse, to be honest, with what's been going on offensively. We have to get some guys to get some big hits for us."	Giants lefty Andrew Suarez (6-11) gave up three runs and six hits in six innings, struck out three and walked three.	SEPT. 11 REMEMBERED	A moment of silence was held before the anthem to remember the victims of Sept. 11, 2001.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Braves: Camargo will sit Wednesday but expects to play Friday back home, though Snitker wants to see him work out first. Camargo said he "didn't feel anything serious" -- more like his groin had cramped up after running to first on a fielding error in the third. He was lifted for a pinch-runner as a precaution. ... RHP Arodys Vizcaino (right shoulder inflammation) is scheduled to join the team Friday back home and come off the disabled list. ... Snitker will have a well-rested bullpen Wednesday after using just three relievers for an inning each during Monday's 4-1 win.	Giants: 1B Brandon Belt may need offseason surgery on his right knee, something that is being discussed, though as of now the plan is for him to finish out the season.

CINCINNATI --  Dodgers manager Dave Roberts didn't breathe a sigh of relief. He could have.	Yasmani Grandal and Justin Turner drove in three runs each, and Los Angeles beat Cincinnati 8-1 Wednesday to avoid a season sweep by the last-place Reds.	Joc Pederson homered for the Dodgers, and Grandal had three hits.	"We can beat them," Roberts said.	"When we played them in L.A., they were on a hot streak," said Grandal, Cincinnati's 2010 top amateur draft pick. "It didn't really matter how we played. We were trying to figure out what to do with our guys. We had a lot of guys hurt. It seems like they played us hard all year."	Los Angeles remained 1 1/2 games behind NL West-leading Colorado and pulled within two games of St. Louis for the second NL wild card after the Cardinals lost to Pittsburgh 4-3. The Dodgers open a four-game series in St. Louis on Thursday.	"That's a big series for us," said Grandal, who finished with three hits. "There's a chance to make some moves in this series."	The Dodgers had been 0-6 against the Reds and were on the verge of being swept by Cincinnati in a season for the first time.	"It's more important that we got a win," Roberts said. "Those guys have been making noise all year. Managing to get a win considering where we were at is a good thing."	Cincinnati's Scooter Gennett went 1 for 4, keeping his league-leading batting average at .321.	"We didn't really worry about sweeping the Dodgers," Reds interim manager Jim Riggleman said. "We just wanted to win the game at hand."	Left-hander Caleb Ferguson (6-2), the third of seven Dodgers pitchers, struck out three in the fifth.	Anthony DeSclafani (7-5) retired the first nine Los Angeles batters before allowing six runs -- five earned -- five hits and three walks in 4 2/3 innings. He failed to last five innings for the third straight start.	"I was rolling," the right-hander said. "I felt good. It seemed like whenever somebody gets on, I can't put a stop to it. It's frustrating. I just have to figure out how to execute pitches. I don't care how many times you go through the batting order, if you execute your pitches, you'll get your outs."	Jose Peraza homered in the first, but Pederson tied it 1-1 with a leadoff drive in the fourth, his second two games and 21st this season.	"Joc's homer gave us kind of an exhale," Roberts said. "I've been talking about J.T.'s at bats every night. Yasmani had some good at bats."	Grandal hit a go-ahead double later in the inning, a ball caught by a young fan with a glove reaching over the wall with the ball still in play. Max Muncy scored from first and Reds manager Jim Riggleman argued unsuccessfully he should have been stopped at third, but the umpires' decision was upheld in a video review.	Turner hit a two-run single in a four-run fifth.	SINGLEHANDED	Pederson homered in back-to-back appearances for the fourth time this year, pushing the Dodgers' streak of consecutive games with at least one home run to 20. That is the most for the team since the move to Los Angeles and four shy of the franchise record set by Brooklyn in 1953.	SPOTLESS DEBUT	Reds RHP Jesus Reyes, recalled by Cincinnati on Tuesday, pitched a scoreless eighth inning. In two career appearances, both this season, he's thrown three hitless innings.	SEASON HIGH	Grandal had three hits for the sixth time this season and first since July 24 at Philadelphia.	UP NEXT	Dodgers: LHP Clayton Kershaw (7-5) is to make his first start of the season against St. Louis on Thursday. He is 6-5 with a 2.99 ERA in 16 starts against the Cardinals.	Reds: RHP Matt Harvey (7-8) limited the Cubs to one run and five hits in 5 1/3 innings of a 10-inning Cincinnati loss on Aug. 24.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

DETROIT --  George Springer understood the situation as he was about to dive for Dawel Lugo's line drive in the eighth inning.	"I could tell I was either going to get to it, or this is going to be a really bad play," the Houston outfielder said. "I'm happy that I got to it."	Springer made the catch to help preserve Houston's lead, and the Astros swept a series at Comerica Park for the first time, wrapping up a three-game set with a 5-4 victory over the Detroit Tigers on Wednesday. The Tigers had a man on first with two outs in the eighth when Lugo hit a liner down the line in right field. Springer made a diving catch . If he had missed and the ball had skipped past, the tying run would have scored.	"I think George on his own took a step toward the line to start the play," Houston manager AJ Hinch said. "Got a great jump on it. With the runner in motion, a lot of bad can happen if he doesn't come up with that, but it's the right play to dive. Certainly the right play to be aggressive."	It was the 13th series sweep of the season for the Astros, who have won 10 of their last 11 games. Houston entered with a three-game lead over Oakland atop the AL West.	Gerrit Cole (14-5) allowed two runs and three hits in five innings. He walked four and struck out nine.	Josh James pitched three innings in relief, allowing a two-run homer by Nicholas Castellanos in the seventh that pulled the Tigers within a run. Ryan Pressly pitched a perfect ninth for his first save.	James McCann also homered for Detroit. Daniel Norris (0-4) allowed five runs and eight hits in 4 2/3 innings.	"I started running out of gas in the third inning, which is frustrating, because that's not how you want to feel," said Norris, who returned from the disabled list Sept. 1 after missing much of the season with a groin injury. "I got through four with a lot of weak contact, but I started missing spots in the fifth and they have great hitters."	Houston trailed 2-1 before scoring four runs in the fifth. Alex Bregman put the Astros ahead with a two-run double, and Tyler White added a sacrifice fly. An RBI double by Marwin Gonzalez made it 5-2.	Bregman opened the scoring with an RBI single in the third. Mikie Mahtook answered with an RBI single in the bottom of the inning, and McCann led off the Detroit fourth with a homer.	The Astros swept a three-game series at Tiger Stadium in 1998, but they'd never done it at Detroit's current ballpark, which opened in 2000.	LEADERS	Cole moved into the American League lead in strikeouts with 260, two more than teammate Justin Verlander. Bregman has a major league-best 50 doubles, along with 100 runs and 100 RBI. The last player to reach all three of those marks in one season was Miguel Cabrera of the Tigers, who had 101 runs, 52 doubles and 109 RBI in 2014.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Astros: C Martin Maldonado was shaken up in the fifth when Detroit's Ronny Rodriguez caught him on the left arm with the bat while following through on a swing. Maldonado stayed in the game.	Tigers: SS Niko Goodrum left the game with a right quad contusion after he collided with LF Christin Stewart when Stewart went to the ground to make the catch on a shallow fly in the second.	UP NEXT	Houston is off Thursday before hosting a three-game series against Arizona. Dallas Keuchel (11-10) starts the opener for the Astros on Friday night.	Detroit also has an off day before three games at Cleveland. Matthew Boyd (9-12) takes the mound for the Tigers on Friday night against Josh Tomlin (1-5).	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	---	Follow Noah Trister at www.Twitter.com/noahtrister	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Blake Snell is locked in on the Tampa Bay Rays' longshot postseason hopes, not thinking about winning the AL Cy Young Award.	Snell took a no-hit bid into the seventh inning and got his major league-leading 19th win, leading the Rays over the Cleveland Indians 3-1 on Wednesday.	"I know that we're winning and that's the most important thing," Snell said. "That's what I'm focused on, that's what we're focused on. All the individual stuff I'll look at later."	Snell (19-5) lost his bid when Jose Ramirez led off the seventh with his 38th homer. Snell won his team-record seventh straight start, striking out nine and walking two in seven innings. He has allowed two earned runs or fewer in 16 consecutive home starts.	Chaz Roe and Jose Alvarado each got three outs, completing a one-hitter. Alvarado earned his eighth save in 11 chances.	The Rays are 8 1/2 games behind Oakland for the second AL wild card with 17 left. The Athletics routed Baltimore on Wednesday night and open a three-game series at Tampa Bay on Friday night.	Snell's ERA dropped to 2.03, second in the AL behind Boston's Chris Sale at 1.96. Snell's 1.24 ERA at home is best in the majors.	"He's got the whole package," Indians manager Terry Francona said. "He's got velocity, breaking ball, changeup, and seeing how much he's improved from one year to the next, that's pretty special stuff."	Cleveland's magic number to clinch a third consecutive AL Central title remained at three.	Ji-Man Choi hit a two-run homer in the first off Carlos Carrasco (16-9), then took a well-inside pitch from Carrasco in the sixth and briefly stared at the mound. Choi hit a winning homer off Brad Hand in the ninth inning on Monday night.	"Every at-bat I can hit a home run you feel great, especially today helping to contribute to a win for Snell," Choi said through a translator.	Cleveland's Edwin Encarnacion stared and shook his head after a high and inside pitch from Snell in the fourth.	"It was nothing," Encarnacion said. "No hard feelings. He tried to go inside. No problem."	Carrasco (16-9) gave up three runs and six hits in seven innings.	Josh Donaldson, acquired by Cleveland from Toronto on Aug. 31, hit into a double play as a pinch-hitter in the eighth. He went 0 for 4 Tuesday in his Cleveland debut, his first big league game since May 28.	Cleveland center fielder Jason Kipnis, left fielder Michael Brantley, catcher Yan Gomes and first baseman Yonder Alonso were also rested.	Tommy Pham extended his career-best hitting streak to 16 games with a two-out infield single in the first and scored on Choi's drive to center field.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Indians: Donaldson is to start at third base on Friday.	Rays: CF Kevin Kiermaier didn't provide details for what the team called a "general illness" that kept him out the lineup the previous two games. "Time to rest really helped," said Kiermaier, who had a fourth-inning sacrifice fly and tripled during the sixth.	NUMBERS	Ramirez's homer was his first since Aug. 17, ending an 88 at-bat drought. ... Tampa Bay OF Mallex Smith stole two bases and has 33 overall. ... The game was played in 2 hours, 20 minutes.	UP NEXT	Indians: RHP Mike Tomlin (1-5) is to face Detroit LHP Matthew Boyd (9-12) on Friday night.	Rays: RHP Diego Castillo (3-2) will start a bullpen game for Tampa Bay Friday night against Oakland RHP Edwin Jackson (5-3). The Rays took three of four from the Athletics in Oakland from May 28-31.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ST. LOUIS --  A small bump in the road.	That's what St. Louis Cardinals infielder Paul DeJong says Wednesday's 4-3 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates was.	"At this point we're flushing this one," DeJong said. "And getting ready for L.A."	The Cardinals begin a key four-game series against the Dodgers on Thursday. St. Louis leads Los Angeles by two games for the second NL wild card. The Dodgers beat the Reds 8-1 on Wednesday.	The Cardinals are 34-19 under new manager Mike Shildt. They have the most wins in the NL after the All-Star break with 33.	Outfielder Harrison Bader is confident St. Louis can break its two-year postseason drought.	"The best time to play our best baseball is towards the end of the season," Bader said. "And I think we're right there. Pitching, defense, offense, I couldn't be more excited for these last few games."	Outfielder Tyler O'Neill agreed:  "We've been playing great in the late innings and had a lot of walk-offs this year. Unfortunately, we couldn't get it done tonight. But we'll be ready for what lies ahead."	Jameson Taillon (13-9) allowed two runs and four hits in seven innings Wednesday, leaving with a 4-1 lead after the first two Cardinals reached in the eighth. He has held opponents to three earned runs or less in his last 19 starts, the second- longest streak in the NL behind New York Mets right-hander Jacob deGrom with 26.	"His command and his control were at a premium," Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said. "All of his pitches were in good sequence. It was all part of the package."	Taillon has gone seven innings or more seven times this season and has limited opponents to two runs or fewer in all of those outings.	"Having a slider helps, it's something else I can throw," Taillon said.	Jose Martinez hit into a run-scoring forceout in the eighth inning against Felipe Vazquez, who allowed Patrick Wisdom's run-scoring single in the ninth. Vazquez rebounded to strike out DeJong and Matt Carpenter with two on to end the game for his 22nd consecutive save and 32nd in 36 chances this year.	"He went to next-level stuff," said Pittsburgh catcher Jacob Stallings, who drove in three runs. "To get those two punch-outs against those quality hitters was pretty spectacular."	Pittsburgh has won six of eight. The Pirates won 11 in a row from July 11-24.	Daniel Poncedeleon (0-2), making his fourth start for St. Louis, allowed two runs and five hits in five innings.	Marcell Ozuna had a run-scoring single in the first for the Cardinals, but Stallings hit a sacrifice fly in the second, Jordan Luplow had a go-ahead single in the third, and Stallings boosted the lead to 4-1 with a two-run single off Mike Mayers in the sixth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: OF Gregory Polanco underwent surgery to repair an acute dislocation of his left shoulder on Wednesday. He was injured on Friday in a 5-3 win over Miami and is likely out for the rest of the season.	Cardinals: INF Jedd Gyorko was activated from the 10-day DL. He had been bothered by a left groin strain. ... C Yadier Molina remains out with a sore hamstring.	UP NEXT	Pirates: RHP Chris Archer (4-7, 4.56) will face LHP Gio Gonzalez (8-11, 4.40) in the opener of a three-game series at Milwaukee on Friday. Archer is making his eighth start for the Pirates after he was acquired from Tampa Bay on July 31.	Cardinals LHP Austin Gomber (5-0, 2.93) is to take on LHP Clayton Kershaw (7-5, 2.32) in the start of a four-game series against the visiting Dodgers on Thursday.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

SAN FRANCISCO --  On a day when Anibal Sanchez didn't have his best command, he found a way to help the Atlanta Braves on their march toward the postseason.	Sanchez kept the Braves close with six strong innings, pinch-hitter Tyler Flowers drove in the go-ahead run in the ninth, and the Braves moved closer to clinching the NL East with a 2-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants on Wednesday.	The Giants lost their 11th straight, the worst skid since the team moved to San Francisco and the longest for the franchise since 1951.	The Braves reduced their magic number for winning the division to 11 with their fifth straight win, matching their best streak of the season, and clinched their first winning record since their last division crown in 2013. Going into Wednesday, Atlanta led second-place Philadelphia by 6 1/2 games.	"We've worked hard to get to this point," Braves manager Brian Snitker said. "We've grinded through things to get to that position. We can look to bigger things now."	Sanchez remains winless in his last seven starts. He gave up one run on six hits and five walks. He induced double-play grounders to escape bases-loaded, one-out situations in the first and the fourth.	"I didn't have the same command I've had before," Sanchez said. "The defense has helped me so much and they got me out of that inning."	The Giants scored just three runs in the series. They were swept by the Braves in a series of three games or more for the first time since 2011.	"It's never fun, obviously. Everybody comes out here and puts in the work, grinding daily, trying to do everything we can to win ballgames," Giants first baseman Brandon Belt said. "These games do matter to us."	Flowers beat out an infield hit that scored Charlie Culberson from third base with two outs in the ninth to put the Giants ahead. A replay review confirmed first base umpire Jeremie Rehak's ruling that Belt's foot was off the bag when Flowers reached first.	"I just don't get that call was not overturned based on the brief look I had at it," Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. "It shows you how much the call on the field plays."	Culberson singled leading off the inning against Will Smith (2-3). He advanced to second on Ender Inciarte's sacrifice bunt and took third on Dansby Swanson's grounder.	Dan Winkler (3-0) pitched a scoreless eighth, and Jonny Venters worked a scoreless ninth for his second save.	Derek Holland matched Sanchez, giving up one run in six innings of five-hit ball. He struck out seven and walked one. Over his last six starts, Holland is 2-0 with a 1.59 ERA and 34 strikeouts in 34 innings.	Evan Longoria put the Giants ahead with an RBI single in the third. The Braves drew even in the sixth on Freddie Freeman's run-scoring single.	SPIKED	Sanchez stayed in the game after Gregor Blanco stepped on his heel when Sanchez was covering first for the first out in the sixth.	"It scared me as soon as it happened, the pain ... but I wanted to finish the inning," Sanchez said.	DISRUPTERS	Asked about his team's potential role as a spoiler, a term he's bristled at in the past, Bochy said, "I probably prefer `disrupters."	The Giants, who are four years removed from winning their third World Series title in a five-year span, play nine of their 15 remaining games against contending teams.	"It's not a great position to be in, but it is a motivating thing for the players this time of year when they're not in it," Bochy said.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Braves: Culberson was in Wednesday's starting lineup at third base in place of Johan Camargo, who left Tuesday's game with left groin tightness.	Giants: Belt was back in the lineup a day after being held out with a sore right knee, an injury that may require offseason surgery.	UP NEXT	Braves: RHP Kevin Gausman (9-10, 3.89 ERA) will pitch Friday at home against Washington. Gausman is 3-1 with a 4.34 ERA in five career starts against the Nationals.	Giants: RHP Chris Stratton (9-9, 4.99) will pitch Friday's series opener at AT&T Park against the Colorado Rockies. The team's winningest pitcher is 1-2 with a 2.84 ERA in four starts since his most recent callup from Triple-A Sacramento on Aug. 21.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

SEATTLE --  The Padres opened their bullpen gate and slammed the door on the Mariners' chances of a comeback.	Four San Diego relievers set a franchise record by striking out nine consecutive batters, preserving a two-run lead in the Padres' 5-4 victory over Seattle on Wednesday.	Trey Wingenter struck out the side in the sixth in relief of Joey Lucchesi. Robert Stock fanned pinch-hitter Ben Gamel, the only batter he faced. Jose Castillo whiffed the next two batters in the seventh and Robinson Cano to start the eighth. And Craig Stammen completed the run by getting Nelson Cruz looking and Ryon Healy swinging.	The totals: nine batters faced, 42 pitches, 31 strikes, zero balls in play.	"A lot of really good slider strikes early (in the count)," Padres manager Andy Green said. "You see what the fastball does after they've seen those sliders -- it just blows by those guys."	Austin Hedges and Hunter Renfroe hit long home runs for the Padres, who finished off a two-game sweep of the fast-sinking Mariners.	The Padres swept the interleague season series against the Mariners after taking two games in San Diego on Aug. 28-29. It was the first time since the two teams started meeting annually in 1997 that either club won every game in a season.	"For us to be successful, you are going to have to do that to five or six teams in the season," Green said. "That will be big if we start doing things like that."	The Mariners have lost 10 of 15 since Aug. 26 to fall out of contention for the AL wild card.	"Certainly we have not had a good run," Mariners manager Scott Servais said.	Hedges helped the Padres jump on Wade LeBlanc early with a two-run homer to left field in the second inning, ending the left-hander's 19-inning scoreless streak. Eric Hosmer reached leading off the inning on shortstop Gordon Beckham's errant throw.	Cruz homered for the Mariners, his 35th of the season, and drove in his 1,000th career run. He's one of 11 active players to reach that total.	Wil Myers put the Padres ahead 3-0 with an RBI double to right-center in the third.	Seattle's infield defense was sloppy again in the fifth. With two outs, third baseman Kyle Seager's throw on Myers' ground ball skipped short of Healy in the dirt. It was Seattle's third error of the game and its ninth during the eight-game homestand.	Renfroe followed with a home run to left, his 22nd of the season.	"We've been there. Everybody has been there -- putting guys on base with the unforced error, or the walk," Renfroe said. "It is very deflating. ... We were on the good end of it this time."	Lucchesi (8-8) allowed three runs on six hits in five innings, winning his second start of the season against the Mariners.	The Mariners' run of futility at the plate ended in the ninth when Seager led off with a homer against Kirby Yates, who then settled down to earn his ninth save in 10 opportunities.	Mitch Haniger had a run-scoring triple in the fifth, and Cano followed with an RBI groundout before Cruz's homer.	LeBlanc (8-4) allowed five runs, two earned, on four hits in five innings.	SHUFFLING LINEUPS	Padres: San Diego had a surprise leadoff hitter Wednesday -- catcher Francisco Mejia, who was playing his seventh game with the team after being promoted from Triple-A El Paso. With Luis Urias injured, Green said he doesn't have a settled leadoff hitter against left-handers.	Mariners: Servais said he wanted to throw a "few different faces" at Lucchesi after he struck out nine in six-plus innings in his previous start against Seattle. Bench players Kristopher Negron, David Freitas and Beckham got starts Wednesday.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Padres: 2B Urias (left hamstring) was "moving around better than anticipated" before the game, Green said, adding that it was still a long shot the prospect would play again this season. Urias injured himself trying to beat out a ground ball in the eighth inning on Tuesday. Cory Spangenberg, Jose Pirela and Freddy Galvis will get playing time at second.	Mariners: A virus continues to do damage inside the clubhouse. SS Jean Segura sat out his second consecutive game and was unavailable to do any pregame work. LHP James Paxton is so sick that he won't even travel with the team Thursday night. "His (scheduled) start Friday is a big question," Servais said. ... It's also uncertain whether RHP Felix Hernandez (right hamstring) will take his turn or not this weekend. ... With a shortage of healthy starters, Servais said it is likely one of the weekend games at the Los Angeles Angels will be a bullpen day. ... LHP Marco Gonzales, who has logged a career-high 150 2/3 innings, will be on a limited pitch count over his final four starts.	UP NEXT	Padres: LHP Robbie Erlin (3-6, 4.42 ERA) will switch places with LHP Eric Lauer and start the opener of a three-game series at the Texas Rangers on Friday. Lauer is now slotted for Saturday.	Mariners: RHP Mike Leake (9-9, 4.11) takes on the Angels on Thursday in the opener of a four-game series and a 10-game trip. Leake has a team-leading 18 quality starts and is seeking to win at least 10 games in back-to-back seasons.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

PHILADELPHIA --  When Aaron Nola can't stop Philadelphia's skid, the Phillies are in trouble.	Stephen Strasburg threw seven impressive innings, Bryce Harper, Ryan Zimmerman and Juan Soto homered and the Washington Nationals beat the freefalling Phillies 5-1 on Wednesday night to complete a three-game sweep.	"We haven't played good baseball due to a ton of variables," Phillies manager Gabe Kapler said.	Nola, a Cy Young Award contender worthy of MVP consideration, had a rough first inning as the Phillies lost their fifth in a row to drop 7 1/2 games behind first-place Atlanta in the NL East with 17 to play. They're 11-23 since Aug. 5, when they had the NL's second-best record.	"I made mistakes and they didn't miss them," Nola said. "We still have a chance. We have some games left."	The Phillies trailed the Mets by seven games with 17 to play in 2007 and rallied to win the NL East to begin a stretch of five straight division titles. They were swept by Colorado in the division series that season but won the World Series in 2008 and the NL pennant in 2009.	"It can change real fast," Nola said. "We can go from three (games back) to seven and seven to three just as fast."	Philadelphia has seven games remaining against the Braves.	Nola allowed four runs and six hits in five innings. His ERA rose to 2.42. He's given up four runs twice in September after only doing it twice in his first 27 starts.	"Their lineup is exceptional," Kapler said. "They throw challenging at-bats at you and they can all take you deep."	Nola, Mets ace Jacob deGrom and Washington's Max Scherzer are the front-runners in the NL Cy Young race. Scherzer has won the past two and previously won the award in the American League with Detroit in 2013.	Strasburg (8-7) allowed one run and struck out nine in his best start since April. He improved to 12-2 against the Phillies.	Harper crushed his 33rd homer, a two-run shot into Philadelphia's bullpen in the first to give the Nationals a 2-0 lead. Anthony Rendon followed with a double and scored on Zimmerman's single.	Zimmerman connected in the fourth, sending a drive into the bushes in straightaway center. Odubel Herrera made a leaping attempt at the fence and nearly caught it.	Soto drove one into the second deck in right field in the sixth off Austin Davis to make it 5-1. The 19-year-old rookie has 19 homers. Harper hit 22 homers as a teenager for the Nationals in 2012.	"It's reminiscent of watching Tony Gwynn growing up," Strasburg said of Soto.	J.P. Crawford hit a solo shot in the fifth for Philadelphia's only run.	TOUCH `EM ALL	Strasburg threw a pitch that hit Philadelphia's Jorge Alfaro, bounced off his arm, hit catcher Matt Wieters on the side of his helmet and then glanced off the plate umpire's mask.	MILESTONE MAN	Nola became the first Phillies pitcher to reach 200 strikeouts in a season since Cliff Lee and Cole Hamels in 2013.	CATCHING UP	The Nationals closed within a half-game of the Phillies for second place behind the Braves.	UP NEXT	Nationals: RHP Joe Ross makes his first start of the season Thursday in a makeup game against the Cubs.	Phillies: RHP Zach Eflin (9-7, 4.42 ERA) pitches Friday night against Miami in the opener of a three-game series. Eflin is 1-0 with a 2.57 ERA in two starts vs. the Marlins this season.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

BALTIMORE --  The Oakland Athletics kept getting hits and scoring runs, circling the bases in a display that manager Bob Melvin described as "remarkable."	Finally, deep into the third inning, Ramon Laureano hit a popup to the shortstop. A mock cheer swelled from the small crowd of 10,480 at Camden Yards.	"I was like, `Ooh.' I didn't realize nobody had gotten out yet," Oakland slugger Matt Olson said.	Olson homered during a 10-run inning in which the first 11 batters reached base, and the Athletics blanked the Baltimore Orioles 10-0 Wednesday night. With their sixth straight victory, the A's moved within one game of the Yankees for the top AL wild card. New York lost 3-1 at Minnesota.	Oakland totaled 10 hits and two walks in its biggest inning of the year. Olson provided the big blow -- a three-run shot off Andrew Cashner (4-15) -- and three different players had two hits.	"I don't know if I've been a part of one of those," Olson said. "It seemed like everybody was working the count and getting a good pitch and squaring it up."	Oakland sent 15 batters to the plate and generated more than enough offense to match its longest winning streak of the season. The A's trail first-place Houston by three games in the AL West and own a comfortable lead for the second wild card.	Daniel Mengden (7-6) pitched five innings of no-hit relief after entering in the second for starter Liam Hendriks, who went one inning by design.	Baltimore's lone hit was a clean single to left field in the first by Trey Mancini. The final 20 batters went down in order following a third-inning walk to Jace Peterson.	"We didn't hit anything hard," manager Buck Showalter said. "Nothing to really put your arms around and feel proud of."	The A's have already clinched their 10th series win in the last 13 (10-1-2) and will go for a three-game sweep of the woeful Orioles on Thursday night. After going a major league-best 34-15 since the All-Star break, Oakland is 32 games over .500 (89-57) for the first time since September 2003.	Baltimore has lost six in a row to fall to 41-104, the worst record in the majors. It's the eighth time this season the Orioles have been mired in a skid of at least six games.	After breezing through the first two innings, Cashner never got another out. Two singles and a walk loaded the bases for Matt Chapman, who hit a two-run double.	Jed Lowrie and Khris Davis followed with singles before Olson hit his 26th home run. Three singles and a walk followed before Cody Carroll retired Laureano.	Chapman followed with an RBI single for the 10th run.	"Pretty remarkable inning," Melvin said. "You don't see that happen very often. It was nice to be able to create a little distance."	There was one remaining moment of suspense. Needing a home run to complete the cycle in the ninth inning, Laureano looked at a called third strike.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: Oakland has used the disabled list 26 times this season, compared to 23 last year. The club record is 27, set in 2016.	Orioles: DH Mark Trumbo (knee surgery) and LHP Richard Bleier (lat surgery) dropped by the clubhouse, even though both are done for the year. The hope is that both will be available at the start of the 2019 season. "We like where it's headed. Everything's been fine," Showalter said. "I wouldn't commit that they're both going to be there on opening day, but there's a chance."	YOUTH IS SERVED	Left fielder DJ Stewart became the 14th player to make his major league debut with Baltimore this season, tying the Orioles record set in 1955.	The Orioles will start a pair of rookie pitchers in the upcoming series against the White Sox. Luis Ortiz -- part of the haul in the July trade for Jonathan Schoop -- makes his first major league start Friday night, and Yefry Ramirez will go Saturday.	UP NEXT	Athletics: LHP Brett Anderson (3-4, 4.02 ERA), who has a 6.55 ERA in two career starts against Baltimore, gets the ball in the series finale Thursday night.	Orioles: Dylan Bundy (7-14, 5.58 ERA) looks for his first victory since July 29. He's 0-5 in his last seven starts with 11 home runs allowed.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

BOSTON --  The scoreboards at Fenway Park were all flashing "100 WINS" to celebrate the Red Sox reaching the milestone for the first time since Ted Williams returned from World War II.	David Price was already thinking about No. 101.	"That's what we've done all year," Price said on Wednesday night after pitching seven innings of three-hit ball to beat the Toronto Blue Jays 1-0. "That's why we have 100 wins right now."	Price (15-6) struck out seven to win his sixth straight decision, leaving after 92 pitches with a lead earned when Rafael Devers scampered home on a wild pitch by Aaron Sanchez (4-6) in the fifth inning. The Red Sox left-hander is unbeaten in 11 starts and is 5-0 with a 1.56 ERA in five starts since the All-Star break.	Steven Wright pitched the eighth and Craig Kimbrel got three outs for his 39th save, and Boston's magic number for clinching the AL East dropped to seven over the second-place New York Yankees.	"Don't get me wrong; 100 is 100. But we've got bigger goals, obviously," Red Sox manager Alex Cora said. "Today we got closer to one of those goals."	A night after becoming the first major league team this year to clinch a playoff spot, Boston won for the 10th time in 14 games and moved a season-high 54 games above .500 for the first time since the 1946 team of Williams, Johnny Pesky, Bobby Doerr and Dom DiMaggio went 104-50.	The Red Sox need only to go 6-10 the rest of the season to break the franchise record of 105 wins, set in 1912. Boston also won 101 games in 1915.	"Somebody just told me it's been done three times here and the last one was 70-something years ago," first baseman Mitch Moreland said. "I think that speaks for itself."	BLUE BLUE JAYS	Sanchez allowed three hits and struck out six, allowing the game's only run after Moreland walked to lead off the fifth. Devers reached on a fielder's choice and took third when Brock Holt poked a single through the hole at shortstop on a hit-and-run.	Sanchez bounced a 2-2 pitch to Jackie Bradley Jr. in the dirt and past catcher Danny Jansen to the backstop, allowing Devers to score.	"I love Price. I keep in touch with Price even to this day," said Sanchez, who was teammates with Price in Toronto in 2015. "To go out there and match what he's doing. ... Just to go out there and have a special night like that was fun. It's unfortunate they scored the way they did and we lost the way we did."	Toronto fell to 1-8 at Fenway Park this year and dropped to a season-worst 15 games below .500.	DOUBLE DUTY	Rowdy Tellez has seven doubles in his first seven games, the most for any player in the majors since 1908. Jonathan Davis had his first major league hit for Toronto, which hasn't won back-to-back games since Aug. 24-25.	CENTURY CLUB	Cora is the first manager with 100 wins in his first season with a club since Felipe Alou with the 2003 San Francisco Giants and the first in his initial season as a big league manager since Dusty Baker with the 1993 Giants.	FOR SALE	Cora said Chris Sale, who returned to the mound on Tuesday night for the first time since Aug. 12, did not report any issues with his left shoulder. Sale was scheduled to play catch on Wednesday and throw a bullpen session on Friday. The plan is for him to pitch three innings against the New York Mets.	"He's encouraged," Cora said. "Yesterday was like his first big league outing. He was all over the plate. He admitted it -- the game sped up on him."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: RHP Marcus Stroman, who hasn't pitched since Sept. 3 because of a blister on his right index finger, may be done for the year, manager John Gibbons said.	Red Sox: RHP Matt Barnes who hasn't pitched since Sept. 4 because of left hip inflammation, played catch on Monday and Tuesday, and he was scheduled to do so again on Wednesday.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays: RHP Sam Gaviglio (3-8) pitches the series finale on Thursday night.	Red Sox: LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (12-4) takes the mound for Boston.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

CHICAGO --  Although the Milwaukee Brewers still trail in the NL Central, they believe the pressure has shifted to the first-place Cubs.	Curtis Granderson homered, tripled and scored three runs, Lorenzo Cain added three hits and the Brewers beat Chicago 5-1 on Wednesday night to move within a game of the division lead.	Granderson finished with three hits and Mike Moustakas had a two-run single for Milwaukee, which took two of three at Wrigley Field.	Josh Hader (6-1) struck out three in a scoreless eighth to get the win. Six Brewers pitchers combined to hold Chicago to six hits.	"We put ourselves in a spot where the division is within reach," Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said. "Now you feel like, really, take care of your own self. You play well and you have a chance to be there."	When asked if winning the series puts pressure on the Cubs, Counsell said: "For sure. That was the goal coming in."	Kris Bryant had two hits and drove in Chicago's run.	"We're still in first place; I'm not worried about that," infielder Javier Baez said. "We know we'll come through as a team. Nobody is going to beat us if we go out there and play."	Granderson nearly began the game with his 48th career leadoff homer, but it was ruled a triple following an umpire review. The ball appeared to bounce off the top of the home run basket twice before falling back into the field of play.	"That might be my basketball skills," Granderson said. "If I would have gotten them in before, then I would have been playing basketball."	Two batters later, Cain singled to drive in Granderson for the game's first run. Travis Shaw's sacrifice fly in the third gave the Brewers a 2-0 lead.	Milwaukee starter Chase Anderson allowed just two hits in four innings before being lifted for a pinch-hitter in the fifth. Chicago then scratched across a run in the bottom of the fifth against relievers Jacob Barnes and Corey Knebel.	Pinch-hitter Tommy La Stella, batting for starter Kyle Hendricks (11-11), led off with an infield single against Barnes and advanced to second on a throwing error by shortstop Hernan Perez. Three batters later, with La Stella on third, Bryant doubled off a 98 mph fastball from Knebel to make it 2-1.	The Brewers gave themselves some breathing room with three runs in the ninth. Granderson led off with a homer against Steve Cishek to make it 3-1. Later in the inning, Moustakas singled through the left side with the bases loaded to make it 5-1.	"Grandy starting the game off and then the homer in the ninth, those were the big moments in the game," Counsell said.	DARVISH SURGERY	Cubs RHP Yu Darvish underwent an arthroscopic procedure on his right elbow to clean out loose debris, the team announced. Darvish was declared out for the season last month after an MRI revealed a stress reaction in the elbow. He recently visited noted orthopedic surgeon James Andrews for a second opinion, and the surgery was recommended.	The procedure, termed a debridement, was performed in Dallas by Texas Rangers physician Keith Meister.	DAY TRIPPIN'	Before opening a three-game home series with Cincinnati this weekend, the Cubs will play a makeup of Sunday's rainout on Thursday in Washington. They are not happy about losing a scheduled day off because it means going 30 straight days without one.	"Playing 30 consecutive days is the difficult part," manager Joe Maddon said. "For me, I don't think that's been discussed enough regarding whether to play or not."	The Cubs announced that Friday's game against the Reds has been moved to 7:05 p.m. It had been scheduled for 1:20.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: RHP Brandon Morrow (right biceps inflammation) threw a 35-pitch bullpen and his next step will be a simulated game this weekend. If all goes well, Morrow hopes to return to the active roster by the end of next week. ...

MINNEAPOLIS --  As he inched closer to a no-hitter, Jake Odorizzi was ready to throw 140 pitches if needed. He was nearing his career high against the New York Yankees, but was confident he could talk Minnesota Twins manager Paul Molitor into leaving him in for the ninth inning if it got to that point.	Odorizzi never made it that far.	His no-hit bid was broken up when Greg Bird laced a run-scoring double with one out in the eighth, and the Twins beat the Yankees 3-1 Wednesday night to take two of three from New York.	The Yankees' lead over Oakland for the top AL wild card was cut to one game as they completed a 4-5 trip.	A tiring Odorizzi walked Luke Voit before Bird lined the next pitch deep into the left-center gap. Odorizzi was immediately pulled and he tipped his cap to the crowd as he walked off to a standing ovation.	"It's been a tough year. There's no if ands or buts about it," Odorizzi said. "So it's good to have one of these outings toward the end, feel the energy, show them kind of what I'm capable of doing."	Odorizzi (6-10) struck out five and walked three, matching his big league high of 120 pitches set while pitching for Tampa Bay against the Twins on June 3, 2016.	There was no hesitation on Molitor's part as he went to take out his starter after Odorizzi finally allowed a hit in the eighth. Odorizzi needed just seven pitches to get through the seventh, but that brought his pitch count to 109 entering the eighth.	"It was a good kind of stress for me, trying to negotiate with Jake in between innings," Molitor said. "No one wants to see anyone get hurt, but he's a veteran. He said he felt great, and I know he would be smart about trying to find ways to take it a pitch at a time, a hitter at a time."	Taylor Rogers relieved Odorizzi and promptly struck out Gleyber Torres before Trevor Hildenberger fanned Andrew McCutchen. Hildenberger finished for his sixth save.	Luis Severino (17-8) allowed one run and four hits in 5 2/3 innings, dropping to 3-6 in his last 11 starts. Severino unsuccessfully tried to persuade manager Aaron Boone to keep him in the game in the sixth.	"He wanted to stay in the game. I'm fine with my guys wanting to stay in the game," Boone said. "He was very pitch efficient. Obviously it wasn't a pitch count issue, it was just starting to get a little away and he's in the fight right now. I respect the hell out of that."	Severino permitted one hit in the first five innings, then gave up a one-out single to Max Kepler in the sixth followed by Ehire Adrianza's go-ahead double.	Joe Mauer's single put runners at the corners, Jorge Polanco struck out on a wild pitch that advanced Mauer, and David Robertson relieved and retired Eddie Rosario on a groundout.	"My confidence is always up," said Severino, tagged with the loss in consecutive starts. "I've had some struggles but that's nothing I can't fix. So I was going to go give 110 percent and compete for my team."	Minnesota opened a 3-0 lead in the seventh when Willians Astudillo hit an RBI single and scored on Kepler's double.	Twins catcher Mitch Garver was removed after two innings. He took a foul tip to the mask in the second, and the team said initial tests did not indicate a concussion.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Yankees: All-Star closer Aroldis Chapman could return next week from nearly a month on the disabled list. Chapman has not pitched since Aug. 21 because of left knee tendinitis, which has bothered him throughout the season. The 30-year-old left-hander threw a bullpen Wednesday and was to return to New York for treatment. Boone anticipates another bullpen session this weekend, then a return.	Twins: 3B Miguel Sano (left leg) said he hopes to play again before the end of the season. "I want to finish strong," he said. Sano was hurt last week when he slid awkwardly into second base against Houston.	UP NEXT	Yankees: RHP Masahiro Tanaka is to start Friday against Toronto. Tanaka has won consecutive starts in September after going winless in August.	Twins: LHP Stephen Gonsalves will make his fifth big league start Thursday at Kansas City.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Tim Anderson kept the White Sox in the game with his glove before he won it with his bat.	Anderson hit a two-run homer in the 12th inning, and Chicago beat the Kansas City Royals 4-2 on Wednesday night.	Anderson's blast off Burch Smith (1-5), the sixth Royals pitcher, landed just beyond the fence in left-center. It was his 19th homer this season.	"It was a good way to cap off the night," Anderson said. "I was looking fastball. The at-bat before that, they started me off with a slider. The first pitch was a fastball up, and I had a feeling that he would throw me another one. I was able to jump on it."	In the bottom of the 11th, Rosell Herrera lined out to Anderson at shortstop, and he threw to third to double off pinch-runner Brett Phillips.	"It's a bang-bang play," he said. "I guess (Phillips) didn't think I could jump. It was close, but it was a good play to get us out of the jam."	Juan Minaya (2-2) pitched two scoreless innings for the win. Hector Santiago, the eighth Chicago pitcher, picked up his second save in as many chances. Jose Rondon also homered for the White Sox, who snapped a seven-game skid, one game short of their season-worst losing streak.	"Tim put a good swing on it," manager Rick Renteria said. "All the guys in the dugout were hoping he would do something there, and he did.	"Both teams did a good job of protecting the strike zone and limiting the scoring."	Adalberto Mondesi tied a career high with four hits and drove in both of Kansas City's runs.	Both teams wasted plenty of scoring chances. The Royals had five runners retired on the bases, while the White Sox left seven men on base.	Royals starter Eric Skogland pitched five innings, allowing two runs on two hits, with two walks and two strikeouts. He made his first start since May 25 after a long stint on the disabled list with a sprained ulnar collateral ligament. He returned Sept. 4 and had pitched two scoreless innings in relief.	"(Skogland) threw the ball really, really well," Kansas City manager Ned Yost said. "Our pitching did a great job. ... We just couldn't find ways."	Carlos Rodon pitched six innings, allowing two runs on five hits.	"My command wasn't great today," Rodon said. "The defense turned some nice double plays, I got through six and the boys got the win."	Whit Merrifield stole two bases to bring his season total to 35, a new career high. He led the AL with 34 swipes last season and tops the league again this year.	After Merrifield stole second in the third inning, Mondesi drove him in with a single for the game's first run. Mondesi stole his 22nd base, his 17th since the All-Star break.	The White Sox answered with two runs in the fourth on Rondon's homer to left, scoring Avisail Garcia, who reached on a two-out walk.	The Royals tied it in the fifth but had a chance for a bigger inning. Ryan O'Hearn reached on a one-out walk, and Merrifield followed with a double to the wall in left center. But O'Hearn went too far around third and was picked off. Merrifield then stole third and scored on Mondesi's second RBI single.	The White Sox had runners on second and third with one out in the seventh, and then loaded the bases with two outs. But Glenn Sparkman induced a fielder's-choice grounder from Anderson to end the inning.	The Royals loaded the bases in the seventh as well but did not score.	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox: INF Matt Davidson remains out of the lineup with what Renteria called sore knees. "Maybe these next four days are just giving him that time to recover," Renteria said. ... 3B Yoan Moncada was out of the lineup. "He's a little sore in the hip," Renteria said. "Today and a natural day off tomorrow, maybe that will help him."	Royals: INF Hunter Dozier was scratched with a sore back. "It's nothing serious," Dozier said before the game. "It's just a little back tightness. It's kind of built up and I woke up this morning pretty sore. I could have played, probably, but they decided to give me one day. I'll be 100 percent tomorrow."	UP NEXT	White Sox: RHP James Shields (6-16, 4.58 ERA) goes in Baltimore on Friday.	Royals: RHP Heath Fillmyer (2-1, 4.75) will face Twins LHP Stephen Gonsalves (0-2, 11.68) on Thursday. It will be Fillmyer's second consecutive start against the Twins. He took a no-decision in a 10-6 loss in Minneapolis last Friday, allowing six runs on six hits in 2 1/3 innings.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

DENVER --  DJ LeMahieu found himself in the spotlight even if he doesn't much care for being in the spotlight.	Walk-off homers will do that. Especially the first one of his career, in the middle of a heated division race.	LeMahieu hit a two-run homer off Yoshihisa Hirano in the ninth inning, and the NL West-leading Colorado Rockies rallied to beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 5-4 on Wednesday night.	"It was cool. Just a great moment," the soft-spoken LeMahieu said. "That was awesome."	LeMahieu launched a fastball over the fence in right as the Rockies kept their 1 1/2-game advantage over Los Angeles intact after the Dodgers beat Cincinnati earlier in the day. The Diamondbacks fell 3 1/2 games behind in the division race. This is the latest in the season the Rockies have been alone in first place since 1995.	A night after getting his first career save, Hirano (4-3) allowed a single by Gerardo Parra off the glove of first baseman Paul Goldschmidt to begin the ninth. Charlie Blackmon bunted Parra over to second and LeMahieu followed with the walk-off homer. He was doused with water after crossing home plate as fans chanted "DJ, DJ, DJ!"	"I was just looking to drive the ball. It was a lot of fun," LeMahieu said.	Hirano's pitch to LeMahieu was the latest miscue by a struggling Arizona bullpen where some roles have been juggled.	"He just made a mistake," Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said. "He threw a fastball that could be taken the other way."	Overlooked in LeMahieu's ninth-inning theatrics was the performance of Colorado's bullpen, which turned in five perfect innings, including two each by Chris Rusin and Scott Oberg. Wade Davis (3-6) picked up the win by pitching a flawless ninth, including two strikeouts.	That marks the first time the Rockies' bullpen has tossed five perfect innings in franchise history, according to the team.	"Awesome the bullpen was able to do our job tonight, throw up a bunch of zeroes and give our team a chance," Oberg said. "In this building, really anything can happen from an offensive standpoint."	Nolan Arenado had a big night for the Rockies with two doubles, including a run-scoring one in the second, and a solo homer.	LeMahieu's blast spoiled a solid outing by Diamondbacks starter Patrick Corbin, who allowed a season-high 10 hits, but navigated his way through trouble. He went 6 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.	The left-hander's most crucial pitch was a slider to strike out LeMahieu with the bases loaded in the fourth.	Arizona's bullpen bent a little in the eighth, issuing two walks, only to have reliever Archie Bradley enter with two outs and get pinch-hitter Carlos Gonzalez to roll out.	Eduardo Escobar's homer in the third inning was his 21st of the season and sixth with the Diamondbacks since being acquired from the Minnesota Twins on July 27. Goldschmidt finished 2 for 4 with a double and extended his streak of reaching base to 48 straight road games. Alex Avila added a solo homer.	"These are tough, tough to lose under these circumstances," Lovullo said. "It hurts."	Since 2015, the Diamondbacks are now 17-6 against Colorado during games played in September or later -- including their win in the NL wild-card contest last October.	Rockies starter Jon Gray labored on a night he didn't have his best stuff. He lasted four innings and allowed four runs.	"I wouldn't be smiling like this if we didn't win the game like we did," Gray said.	SCOREBOARD WATCHING	Asked if he watches scoreboards, manager Bud Black quipped: "It's hard not to. We have a beautiful scoreboard out there."	Playing right field, Gonzalez has a close-up view of the scoreboard over his shoulder.	"When we're not winning, I go like this," he said, turning his heard as if he was looking at the scoreboard. "Just to make sure the other team is not doing better."	WEIGHING IN	Arenado and Trevor Story are both starting to get some mention in the NL MVP race. Gonzalez's vote would be simple -- both.	"Either way it goes, I will feel extremely happy," he said of the possibility of a teammate winning the award.	UP NEXT	Arizona RHP Clay Buchholz (7-2, 2.01 ERA) makes his first career start at Coors Field in the finale of a four-game series with Colorado on Thursday. The Rockies will throw LHP Kyle Freeland (14-7, 2.91), who is 8-2 at home this season. The game will be an MLB Facebook Watch broadcast.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Francisco Arcia and Jose Fernandez aren't your typical rookies.	They are a combined 58 years old and took long paths toward their major league debuts this season. They've become close friends and, on Wednesday night, both flashed some power.	Arcia homered twice and drove in four runs, Fernandez hit his second career homer and the Los Angeles Angels beat the Texas Rangers 8-1 on Wednesday night.	Arcia had a two-run double in the second inning off Yovani Gallardo and homered in the sixth and again in the eighth. Fernandez, the 30-year-old rookie from Cuba, went deep again after hitting his first major league homer on Tuesday.	"We're always together," said the 28-year-old Arcia, who spent 11 years in the minors. "We're like brothers. We're always talking about how we want to play here like we played in little leagues and minor leagues. Just living the dream. Play hard every day. Take the opportunity they give to us."	Felix Pena (3-4) worked six scoreless innings, striking out three and walking one, as the Angels won for the sixth time in seven games.	Joey Gallo hit his 36th homer of the season for the Rangers, who have lost five of six. He said he was OK after some discomfort during his final at-bat.	"Just a stinger. Last at-bat, the knob dug into my wrist, so it was kind of ringing on me that last at-bat, but it's good," Gallo said. "It will be fine."	A day earlier, the Angels gave Fernandez the customary silent treatment after his homer before Trout splashed him in the face with a cup of water. This time, Trout was waiting on the top step of the dugout to give Fernandez a high-five after his third-inning homer, which made it 6-0.	The 27-year-old Trout has enjoyed watching two rookies who are older than him.	"It's awesome," Trout said. "Obviously, it's not where we want to be from the team standpoint, but guys are getting opportunities to play and they're taking advantage of it. It's fun to be a part of. I see them come in and work hard every day. You can't take that away from them. They're getting an opportunity to play in the big leagues. They're having fun with it."	Arcia, who made his major league debut on the day Martin Maldonado was traded to the Astros, has five homers this season.	Justin Upton tripled to left field to score a run in the third, snapping a skid of 15 hitless at-bats, to put the Angels ahead 3-0.	Gallardo (8-5) allowed six runs on six hits in three innings.	TROUT'S CATCH OF THE DAY	Trout had an outfield assist in the third, a two-hop throw to catcher Arcia to cut down Robinson Chirinos at the plate.	Manager Mike Scioscia said there's no doubt his center fielder should win his first Gold Glove.	"It's every outfielder's dream," Trout said. "I try to go out there and catch everything and throw everybody out. It'd be pretty cool."	BOBBLEHEAD LIKENESS?	The Angels revealed the Scioscia bobblehead that will be given away on Sept. 29. Asked what he thought of it, Scioscia joked, "I'm going to try to say `ugly' in three languages."	Scioscia needed it translated in Japanese, but he knew and said "feo," the Spanish word for ugly.	The bobblehead depicts Scioscia holding a lineup card that features some of the best players he's managed in 19-year tenure -- including leadoff hitter Trout and Hall of Famer Vladimir Guerrero in the No. 2 spot.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Angels: RHP Shohei Ohtani (right elbow ligament) is not getting any treatment for his injury, just routine body maintenance. He is expected to decide before the season ends whether he will have the recommended Tommy John surgery and, if so, when. ... DH Albert Pujols (elbow, knee) had surgery on his right elbow Wednesday to remove bone spurs.	UP NEXT	Rangers: LHP Yohander Mendez (1-1, 5.27 ERA) will start for the Rangers to open a series Friday in San Diego. Mendez will make his fourth major league start. After allowing a first-inning home run to Khris Davis in his last start, he retired 10 of the final 12 batters he faced.	Angels: RHP Odrisamer Despaigne (2-2, 6.40) will be the opener on a bullpen day. The Angels had a bullpen game on Tuesday and went 7 1/3 innings before allowing a hit.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

DENVER --  Kyle Freeland got in on the fun at the plate, too, for the Colorado Rockies.	Freeland pitched effectively into the seventh and had two hits, and the Rockies beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 10-3 on Thursday to maintain their NL West lead.	Nolan Arenado and Trevor Story homered and David Dahl had three hits and two RBI to help Colorado remain 1 1/2 games ahead of Los Angeles and increase its advantage over the third-place Diamondbacks to 4 1/2 games. Los Angeles won 9-7 at St. Louis on Thursday night.	"We're playing good baseball, we're a very confident team," Arenado said. "Everyone's playing a part. It's great."	Freeland played two parts -- keeping Arizona's offense in check until his left calf cramped up in the seventh and doing damage with his bat. He had an RBI double in the second inning and started a rally in the fourth with a bunt single down the third base line.	"I was amazed with him today. I really was," Arenado said. "I was like, `He's an animal. He wants to pitch, he wants to hit, he wants to run, he just wants to be out there.' The best pitchers in this game, that's how they are."	Freeland (15-7) was just as effective on the mound. He allowed two through six innings and left with one out in the seventh after giving up two extra-base hits. A cramp that bothered him in the sixth inning flared up again, but he said he is fine.	"I've had it on the mound a couple of times before the season," he said. "It's nothing that I have concern about."	He was scheduled to face Clay Buchholz in the finale of the four-game series but the Diamondbacks right-hander was scratched from the start because of tightness in his right elbow. Matt Koch (5-5) started in his place and allowed four runs on eight hits in three innings.	Manager Torey Lovullo said Buchholz felt the tightness in his elbow 26 pitches into his 32-pitch warmup and he was shut down.	"We have learned through some difficult circumstances just get him off the mound and get him evaluated," Lovullo said. "So he is presently on his way back to Arizona to see our team doctors and obviously get an MRI."	A.J. Pollock homered for Arizona. The Diamondbacks are 3-12 in September. They lost 5-4 on Wednesday night when DJ LeMahieu hit a two-run homer off Yoshihisa Hirano in the ninth inning.	Arizona trailed 5-1 when Freeland gave up a triple to Steven Souza Jr. and a double to Nick Ahmed in the seventh. Freeland left after manager Bud Black and trainer Keith Dugger came to the mound.	Yencey Almonte gave up an RBI double to Ketel Marte that made it 5-3. The Rockies responded with five runs in the bottom of the inning.	Things don't get easier for the Diamondbacks. They head to Houston to play the AL West leaders in a three-game weekend series.	"We gotta get going, time is running out," Souza said. "We are making it more difficult on ourselves but it's not impossible."	After Arenado and Pollock traded solo home runs, Freeland hit an RBI double over Pollock's head in center to drive in Arenado and give the Rockies a 2-1 lead.	Story's home run in the third made it 4-1 and Freeland came through again in the fourth. He laid down a bunt single down the third base line to lead off and then scored on Dahl's double to the corner in left.	POWER COUPLE	Arenado and Story entered the franchise record books with their long balls. Arenado's drive, his team-leading 34th, gave him 100 RBI to become just the fourth player in Rockies history to have four straight seasons with at least 30 home runs and 100 RBI.	Story's homer, his 33rd, is the most by a Colorado shortstop. He was tied with Troy Tulowitzki, who had 32 in 2009.	Story trails Arenado in homers this season but he did have bragging rights Thursday. His 471-foot drive bested Arenado's by 6 feet.	"I really don't care too much about that," Story said. "Maybe later it's cool to see how far it went. Just trying to put a good swing on the ball. If it goes over the fence, that's all that matters."	GOING SOCIAL	Thursday's game was aired exclusively on Facebook Live.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: LHP T.J. McFarland was sent back to Phoenix to have an MRI on his sore elbow.

WASHINGTON --  The Chicago Cubs got nearly everything they wanted out of their day trip to Washington to face the Nationals, and Javier Baez was in the middle of nearly all of it.	Reliever Pedro Strop's hamstring injury while running the bases was a notable exception.	Baez delivered the go-ahead run with a bunt single in the 10th inning as Chicago beat Washington 4-3 in a makeup of a game postponed earlier in the week. Baez, an MVP candidate, also homered and drove in three runs. He has 31 homers and leads the NL with 103 RBI.	Chicago stretched its lead in the NL Central to 1 1/2 games over idle Milwaukee. Washington fell 8 1/2 games behind Atlanta in the NL East.	"I think that got us right back on track," Baez said. "Everybody's hitting the ball really good. I think we're going to take off soon."	Strop (6-1), who pitched 1 2/3 scoreless innings, was set to pitch the 10th after the Cubs took the lead and was allowed to bat with the bases loaded and one out. In his second at-bat of the season, he hit a sharp double-play grounder to third and pulled up while running to first.	Cubs manager Joe Maddon said Strop would undergo an MRI and was unlikely to be available Friday.	"Everything that happened in that game, how hard we fought to win that game? Exhilarating," Maddon said. "But losing him at that point, possibly or probably for a bit, takes a little bit of the exultation out of it. It's tough. It was tough to watch him pull up."	Strop has served as Chicago's closer since Brandon Morrow was placed on the disabled list on July 18. He is 11 of 13 in save situations in that span and has 13 saves on the season. Strop, who lowered his ERA to 2.26, had held hitters to a .180 average entering Thursday.	Kris Bryant doubled with one out in the 10th against Sean Doolittle (3-3) and moved to third on ex-National Daniel Murphy's infield single. Baez bunted just to the right of first baseman Ryan Zimmerman to score Bryant, who did not anticipate Baez's choice.	"No, which is probably why it worked," Bryant said. "Zimmerman probably wasn't expecting it either. I didn't know if he was going to catch it or not. Thankfully, he didn't because I probably was too far off the bag. We needed something to fall our way and that was certainly the play that did."	Also caught off-guard was Doolittle, who pitched a scoreless ninth before returning for the 10th.	"If you had told me that I was going to get beat by Javy in extra innings, I would not have thought it would be on a bunt," Doolittle said. "But that's what makes him dangerous is he can beat you a number of different ways. And he put it just out of the reach of Zim. I saw it go up off his bat and I thought we had a chance to catch it, but it was just far enough over."	Randy Rosario worked a perfect 10th for his first career save.	The game was a makeup of Sunday's rainout. Washington returned home between stops in Philadelphia and Atlanta, while Chicago wedged the game in between a pair of three-game series at home. Thursday was the last remaining mutual off day for the teams, and the Cubs arrived at their hotel rooms around 4 a.m. -- 12 hours before the first pitch. First baseman Anthony Rizzo boarded the flight to Washington in full uniform.	Washington took the lead on Spencer Kieboom's solo homer in the third. However, the Cubs got to Nationals starter Joe Ross in the fourth, with Baez delivering an RBI double and then scoring a batter later on Victor Caratini's single. The Nationals tied it on Victor Robles' sacrifice fly in the fifth.	Baez's opposite-field homer into the Nationals' bullpen in the sixth gave Chicago a 3-2 lead. An inning later, Trea Turner capped an 11-pitch plate appearance with an RBI double to score Robles.	Ross faced major league hitters for the second time since undergoing Tommy John surgery in July 2017, allowing two runs, four hits and two walks in five innings. Rain wiped out his first start in the second inning last Friday.	Mike Montgomery allowed two runs on three hits in four innings for the Cubs, who used eight relievers.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Cubs: OF Kyle Schwarber and the team's starting pitchers remained in Chicago during the trip to Washington.	UP NEXT	Cubs: Chicago heads back to Wrigley Field to open a three-game series against Cincinnati as LHP Cole Hamels (9-9, 3.71 ERA) gets the ball. Hamels is 4-0 with a 1.42 ERA since his acquisition from Texas.	Nationals: RHP Max Scherzer (17-6, 2.31) starts the opener of a three-game series at Atlanta. The three-time Cy Young winner is 2-1 with a 1.67 ERA and 30 strikeouts in 27 innings this season against the Braves.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

NEW YORK --  On the day that Mets captain David Wright announced he'll return to play his last big league game during New York's final homestand, Todd Frazier did his fellow third baseman proud.	Michael Conforto and Frazier hit back-to-back homers with two outs in the ninth inning to give New York a 4-3 victory in the first game of a doubleheader, and the Mets went on to sweep the Marlins, winning the nightcap 5-2 on Thursday.	New York had been held to just two hits before the dramatic homers, including starting pitcher Steven Matz's first career home run.	The last Mets third baseman to hit a walk-off homer was Wright in 2008. The seven-time All-Star is expected to be activated from the 60-day disabled list when the team returns home Sept. 25, and is slated to start on Sept. 29 against Miami. Wright has not played in the majors since May 2016.	"He's one of the greatest Mets to play here," Frazier said. "He'll go down as one of the better third basemen to ever play this game. So he deserves all the accolades. And that's Mr. Met right there. So it's awesome to be a part of that. That's pretty cool, especially being a third baseman."	Although he's not officially retiring, Wright is not expected to play again after this season because of debilitating neck, back and shoulder injuries that have plagued him for years.	"He was our leader," Conforto said. "I'm looking forward to playing with him again at least one more time, taking the field with him, and I'm excited for that. It's going to be fun."	The Mets have hit 14 homers in their last seven games. It was the fourth time they've swept a doubleheader at Citi Field, which opened in 2009, and the first time in seven years.	New York took three of four in the series and has won nine of 12.	Conforto drove in three more runs in the nightcap, and Jason Vargas pitched six effective innings.	Conforto clubbed a double in front of the visitors' bullpen in right-center field in the fifth inning, scoring two runs and putting New York in front 3-2. The hot-hitting outfielder added an RBI single in the seventh.	"We have to capitalize on mistakes and he's definitely doing that right now," manager Mickey Callaway said.	Rookie Tomas Nido got New York on the board in the fifth inning of game two with his first big league homer, a solo shot into the left field seats off Jeff Brigham. Vargas and Amed Rosario followed with consecutive singles, chasing Jeff Brigham (0-2) for reliever Jarlin Garcia.	Vargas (6-9) allowed two runs on three hits, walked two, hit a batter and struck out seven. The veteran left-hander is 4-1 with a 3.09 ERA over his last six starts.	Seth Lugo hurled two scoreless innings in relief, fanning the first five Marlins he faced. Robert Gsellman worked around a two-out walk in the ninth for his 11th save.	Lugo tied a franchise record by striking out at least five batters in consecutive relief appearances and is just the third reliever since at least 1908 with consecutive outings of two innings pitched or shorter with five or more strikeouts.	Brigham led off the third with his first big league hit, a single up the middle. Miguel Rojas followed with his 11th homer, driving a 2-1 fastball into the lower deck in left-center field to give Miami a 2-0 advantage.	The Marlins managed just one more hit the rest of the game.	LATE-INNING MAGIC	The opener was the first time in franchise history that the Mets hit back-to-back homers for a walk-off win, according to Elias. The Mets have five game-ending homers in this otherwise forgettable season. Only the 1962 and 1963 teams had more, with six.	Embattled reliever Kyle Barraclough entered with one out in the ninth and retired Dominic Smith before Conforto lined a 1-0 changeup into the second deck in right to tie the game. Frazier followed by hitting a 1-1 pitch over the wall in left-center field, prompting his teammates to rush from the dugout and mob the veteran third baseman as he crossed home.	"I was hoping that Michael got on. He did his job, and in my mind I was trying to hit a home run," Frazier said. "Those rarely happen. Got a pitch to hit and kind of squeaked one over, so we'll take it."	Barraclough (0-6) blew a save for the seventh time in 17 opportunities.	Jerry Blevins (3-2) pitched a scoreless ninth for the win.	DONNIE BASEBALL	The Mets weren't the only ones happy that Wright will suit up for one last game.	"I'm glad that he's going to get back and be able to play," said Marlins manager Don Mattingly, a six-time All-Star and former MVP who also dealt with debilitating back injuries. "I don't know his whole road, but I know it's been a rough one the last few years."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: OF Austin Dean was a late scratch from the first game because of nausea. He sat out the nightcap.	Mets: C Devin Mesoraco (bulging disk in back) is almost pain-free and could be close to returning, Callaway said.	UP NEXT	Marlins: LHP Wei-Yin Chen (6-10, 4.72 ERA) opens a weekend series in Philadelphia on Friday night.	Mets: RHP Noah Syndergaard (11-3, 3.44) takes on baseball's best team Friday as New York heads to Fenway Park for a three-game set against the Boston Red Sox. Syndergaard is 5-1 over his last seven starts.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

BOSTON --  Thanks to a miscue by Toronto, the Boston Red Sox moved one step closer to clinching the AL East title.	J.D. Martinez hit his 41st home run and the Red Sox scored the tiebreaking run on an eighth-inning error, completing a three-game sweep of the Blue Jays with a 4-3 victory Thursday night.	After the Blue Jays rallied for two runs to tie it at 3 in the top of the eighth, Xander Bogaerts doubled in the bottom half and stole third. He came home when Toronto second baseman Yangervis Solarte dropped a popup in shallow right field.	"That was a huge situation," Bogaerts said. "I've made errors to make us lose, so I definitely know how he feels. But it's good we're on the good side."	Rafael Devers also went deep for the major league-leading Red Sox (101-46), who pulled 10 1/2 games ahead of the idle New York Yankees and decreased their magic number to six for securing a third straight division crown.	Boston is the only team in the majors that's already locked up a playoff berth.	Brandon Workman (5-0) faced one batter, ending Toronto's eighth-inning rally with just three pitches, and got the win. Craig Kimbrel earned his 40th save.	Danny Barnes (3-3) took the loss for the Blue Jays, who were down 3-1 entering the eighth.	"We clawed back into it after the bullpen did a nice job," manager John Gibbons said.	Lourdes Gurriel Jr. homered in the eighth for Toronto and the Blue Jays added another run after Justin Smoak walked with two outs and Kendrys Morales followed with a single. Joe Kelly hit Randal Grichuk with a pitch to load the bases, then plunked Kevin Pillar to force in the tying run.	"He knows that tonight wasn't a great night for him," Red Sox manager Alex Cora said about Kelly.	Devers hit a solo homer with two outs in the sixth off Mark Leiter Jr., putting Boston up 3-1.	Martinez went deep in the second, tying Oakland's Khris Davis for the major league lead in homers.	Sam Gaviglio pitched 3 1/3 innings for Toronto, allowing two earned runs and six hits.	ON THE RUN	Bogaerts said he wanted to be aggressive after his double in the eighth and he got a great jump as Barnes was pitching to Blake Swihart.	"I was just trying to get to third and make things a little bit easier," Bogaerts said. "Trying to get a guy home from third with one out is better than trying to get a guy in from second."	Bogaerts was halfway down the third-base line and had a clear view as Solarte tried to get under the ball before it bounced off his glove.	"You have to make that play. It's not always easy when the infield is in," Gibbons said.	SOLID START	Boston starter Eduardo Rodriguez recovered from a rough outing in a 6-3 loss to Houston last Friday, when the Astros tagged him for five runs and six hits over 3 1/3 innings.	Rodriguez struck out seven in six innings this time, retiring the last nine batters he faced. He struck out two in the sixth before the Red Sox turned it over to their bullpen in the seventh. He allowed one run on five hits and didn't walk a batter.	It was only his third start since coming off an extended stint on the disabled list with a sprained right ankle.	Cora said he wasn't about to push Rodriguez.	"It was more about taking care of him," the manager explained. "I felt that six was good. The way he threw the ball in the sixth inning was good enough for me."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: 3B Eduardo Nunez left in the fourth with soreness in his right knee after hitting a leadoff double. Nunez, who tripped and stumbled over first base while running out a fielder's choice in the second, was replaced by Devers.	UP NEXT	Blue Jays: RHP Marco Estrada (7-11, 5.32 ERA) starts Friday for Toronto in the first of three games at Yankee Stadium.	Red Sox: RHP Hector Velazquez (7-2, 3.29) gets the ball when Boston opens a three-game series at home against the New York Mets.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.

BALTIMORE --  Presented with an opportunity to make up ground in their playoff run, the Oakland Athletics were mounting a comeback against the Baltimore Orioles' shaky bullpen in the eighth inning of a tight game.	Mychal Givens would have none of it.	Givens put an end to the potential rally, and the Orioles snapped Oakland's six-game winning streak with a 5-3 victory Thursday night.	Stephen Piscotty homered for the A's, who fell 3 1/2 games behind first-place Houston in the AL West and 1 1/2 back of the Yankees for the top wild-card slot.	Down 4-2 in the eighth, Oakland hit successive singles off Miguel Castro and loaded the bases with one out. After Paul Fry walked Matt Olson to force in a run, Givens struck out Piscotty and retired Marcus Semien on a fly ball.	Jace Peterson doubled in a run in the bottom half, and Givens finished for his seventh save despite issuing a leadoff walk in the ninth.	"We give ourselves opportunities a lot and typically we come through," Oakland manager Bob Melvin said. "We had a lot of chances, especially in the eighth inning, which was a big inning for us. We didn't come through, especially with Stephen up at the plate."	The credit goes to Givens, who's been closing since Baltimore traded Zach Britton in late July.	"That was a pretty good pitcher they brought in, especially against righties," Melvin said.	Dylan Bundy had eight strikeouts in six solid innings for the Orioles, who snapped a six-game skid and avoided being swept for the 22nd time.	Bundy (8-14) gave up two runs and six hits to earn his first win since July 29. The right-hander was 0-5 in his previous seven starts.	"He made them beat his breaking ball," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. "He had good command of it and they didn't seem like they were seeing it or following it."	Oakland activated lefty Brett Anderson from the 10-day disabled list to make his 14th start of the season. In his return from a forearm injury, Anderson (3-5) allowed four runs and didn't make it out of the fourth inning.	His night began when Cedric Mullins topped a ball down the third-base line that rolled tantalizingly close to being foul but never was. Four batters later, Tim Beckham hit a two-run single to put Baltimore ahead to stay.	"Today was about as frustrating as it could get," Anderson said. "Every groundball they hit found a hole."	Piscotty made it 2-1 in the second with his 24th home run, the major league-leading 38th allowed by Bundy.	The Orioles got RBI singles from John Andreoli and Breyvic Valera in the fourth, and Oakland answered with a run-scoring single by Nick Martini in the fifth.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: RHP Trevor Cahill had an MRI on his right shoulder due to soreness in his upper back. Melvin scratched Cahill from Saturday's start and will probably go with reliever Liam Hendriks. Melvin said that if Cahill responds to treatment, he could start twice during the Sept. 18-23 homestand.	Orioles: RHP Andrew Cashner had an MRI on his left knee. Showalter said no structural damage was found, but the pitcher got a cortisone shot and could miss a start. ... RHP Alex Cobb won't pitch until Sept. 21 at the soonest because of an irksome blister, Showalter said.	MORE THE MERRIER	The Athletics have suited up 53 players this season, one short of the Oakland record set in 2007 and matched last year.	Baltimore has used 55 players this season, most since the team moved from St. Louis in 1954. That includes 28 pitchers, an Orioles record.	UP NEXT	Athletics: RHP Edwin Jackson (5-3, 3.26 ERA) is on the mound for the opener of a three-game series at Tampa Bay.	Orioles: RHP Luis Ortiz, obtained in the Jonathan Schoop trade with Milwaukee on July 31, makes his first major league start in a matchup with the visiting White Sox.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

ST. LOUIS --  The Dodgers got some help from a former Cardinal before their pivotal series against St. Louis.	David Freese, who joined Los Angeles in a trade with the Pirates at the end of August, offered some insight on the Cardinals' young pitchers during the Dodgers' hitters meeting. The advice paid off.	Manny Machado homered and drove in three runs to back Clayton Kershaw, and the Dodgers beat the Cardinals 9-7 in the opener of a four-game series between playoff contenders.	"Just better approaches," Machado said. "Keep it simple. See the ball, hit the ball. The guy's going to have to throw it over the plate and when we make good contact and when we're at our best, we're not going to miss those opportunities."	The Dodgers snapped a five-game losing streak against the Cardinals and moved to within one game of St. Louis for the final NL wild-card spot. The Cardinals, who went 22-6 in August, lost their second straight game and fell to 5-7 in September.	Kershaw (8-5), pitching at Busch Stadium for the first time since taking the loss in Game 4 of the 2014 NL division series, struck out eight in six innings, allowing four runs -- three earned -- on eight hits and two walks.	"I felt good tonight," Kershaw said. "My curveball wasn't great but my other two (pitches) I felt like I had good command tonight."	Freese tripled on a 14-pitch at-bat against Austin Gomber to score Chris Taylor and Machado in the first. Matt Kemp followed with a single to score Freese.	"I threw him everything I had," Gomber said. "I went back and looked at the video. I thought the first 13 pitches were good pitches and the 14th one wasn't. He made me pay. Kind of just how the night went. They put some swings on pitches that I thought were good pitches."	Kershaw's RBI single started a four-run fourth and drove Gomber (5-1) from the game. Taylor followed with an RBI double, and Justin Turner and Machado had sacrifice flies as the Dodgers went ahead 8-1.	Machado went 3 for 4, and his solo homer in the seventh traveled 417 feet to center.	"We did what we needed to do," Machado said. "We got runners in scoring position. We got the runners in. Hopefully we can repeat it."	It was Gomber's first loss in the majors. The rookie left-hander went three-plus innings and gave up a career-high seven runs on nine hits.	"You saw us fighting and winning pitches," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. "We have a lineup that can kind of grind starters and get a big hit and use the whole field."	Cardinals reliever Tyson Ross hit his second career home run in the fifth, sparking a three-run rally. He became the fourth Cardinals pitcher to homer this season, the most the team has had since 1966.	Matt Carpenter had a pair of singles and scored twice. Marcell Ozuna had two hits, an RBI and scored a run.	"I'm really proud of the guys tonight," Cardinals manager Mike Shildt said. "They one-through-nine battled to the end. That's what this team does."	The Cardinals scored twice and brought the tying run to the plate in the ninth. Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen needed 29 pitches to finish the game in a non-save situation.	"It got a little nerve-wracking there," Roberts said. "Obviously he's our guy, but he wasn't sharp tonight and he found a way to close it out for us."	FAN-TASTIC	The attendance was announced at 40,997, putting the Cardinals over the 3 million mark for the 15 straight season and 22nd overall.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: RHP Ross Stripling will move back into the rotation for Sunday's game, moving LHP Hyun-Jin Ryu back to Monday and LHP Alex Wood to the bullpen.	Cardinals: C Yadier Molina (left hamstring tightness) returned to the starting lineup after missing six games. He went 0 for 1 with a walk before leaving the game after the fourth inning with St. Louis trailing by seven. "He feels like he can catch without any issue, and clearly he'll be a little compromised on the bases," Shildt said. "It's something that we'll sacrifice him scoring maybe a run, of course clearly we might pinch-run for him late in the game if it's applicable."	UP NEXT	The Cardinals send RHP Jack Flaherty (8-6, 2.92 ERA) to the mound Friday night. The Dodgers will counter with RHP Walker Buehler (6-5, 3.09) in a rematch of a duel between the rookies in a 3-1 Cardinals win at Dodger Stadium on Aug. 22. Flaherty struck out 10 in that game, giving up one hit (a solo homer by Joc Pederson) in six innings, while Buehler allowed three hits and struck out nine over seven scoreless innings.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Salvador Perez put himself in the company of some Hall of Famers at his position.	Perez and Jorge Bonifacio hit back-to-back homers during a four-run sixth inning, Heath Fillmyer pitched into the eighth and the Kansas City Royals held on for a 6-4 victory over the Minnesota Twins on Thursday night.	The loss by the Twins, who occupy second place in the woeful AL Central, reduced the division-leading Cleveland Indians' magic number to two.	Perez's 420-foot drive to left field was his 25th homer. He became the first AL catcher with back-to-back seasons of at least 25 home runs since Hall of Famer Ivan Rodriguez, who did it three straight years from 1999-2001. Another Hall of Famer, Mike Piazza, had eight consecutive seasons of 30 or more homers, ending in 2002.	Perez hit a career-high 27 homers last year.	"As a power hitter, he gets better every year," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "That was a huge hit there to give us the lead. Up to that point, we were really scuffling. We hadn't gotten a hit until that inning and Salvy came in and gave us a big boost."	The Royals trailed 2-1 and were hitless until Hunter Dozier greeted Alan Busenitz, the Twins' third pitcher of the game, with a leadoff double to left field in the sixth. Perez and Bonifacio followed with home runs.	"(Busenitz) tried to go up and missed right in the middle," Perez said. "I took a pretty good swing."	Busenitz (4-1) faced three batters, all of whom scored, inflating his ERA to 7.71.	"It's very frustrating because I know what I'm capable of and I'm not doing it," Busenitz said. "You've got to work on it and get better. You've got to learn from it and not make the same mistakes, you know?"	Fillmyer (3-1) worked 7 1/3 innings, allowing four runs on five hits and matching his career high with six strikeouts. In his previous start, the Twins bludgeoned him for six runs in 2 1/3 innings.	"I just wanted to get ahead, stay on the attack, not walk anybody, and try to let them get themselves out like I usually do," Fillmyer said.	Jake Cave hit a two-run homer, his 11th of the season, in the second against Fillmyer, who allowed only one hit and one walk during the next 5 1/3 innings.	Fillmyer left in the eighth with runners on the corners, both of whom eventually scored against relievers Brian Flynn and Brandon Maurer.	Jerry Vasto got the last out in the eighth in his fourth career appearance.	"Heath dominated tonight. He threw well," Vasto said. "I definitely wanted to come in and get those outs for him."	Wily Peralta worked a perfect ninth for his 11th save in 11 opportunities.	Eddie Rosario, who returned from missing four games after re-aggravating a quad injury, had an RBI single off Flynn, and Grossman delivered a sacrifice fly against Maurer to make it 5-4 before Vasto ended the threat.	The Twins went with a bullpen day, opening with Gabriel Moya, who worked two scoreless innings. Stephen Gonsalves pitched the next three, allowing no hits but walking four, and the last of those walks turned into a run in the fifth when Whit Merrifield scored on an error by shortstop Jorge Polanco.	Merrifield singled, stole second, went to third on an error and scored on Alex Gordon's fielder's choice for an eighth-inning insurance run.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals: OF Brett Phillips (shoulder) remains available as a pinch runner, but hasn't been fully cleared.	Rays: C Mitch Garver (head) woke up with a headache after taking a foul ball off the facemask on Wednesday.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Nelson Cruz has enjoyed plenty of success over the years against the Los Angeles Angels.	This season has been the best yet.	The veteran slugger hit a three-run homer, Mike Leake pitched seven strong innings and the Seattle Mariners started a 10-game road trip with an 8-2 victory over the Angels on Thursday night.	Cruz's shot to center field off Neal Ramirez in the fourth was his eighth homer this season versus the Angels, the most by one player in a single year against the franchise, according to Baseball-Reference.	"That ball was in the air forever," Seattle manager Scott Servais said. "Nelson has always swung the bat good against them, for whatever reason. He sees the ball good in this ballpark. There's really no ballpark that can hold him, but he sees real good pitches here."	The home run was also Cruz's 50th against the Angels, which gave him the second-most for any player against the team. Alex Rodriguez hit 70.	"I play a lot against them," Cruz said. "So maybe that's why."	Cruz, Mitch Haniger, Robinson Cano and Kyle Seager each had two of Seattle's 12 hits.	Los Angeles was eliminated from playoff contention.	Leake (10-9) threw a season-high 114 pitches (80 strikes), allowing one run and four hits with a walk and five strikeouts. His only costly mistake came in the seventh when Justin Upton homered to left.	After going 0-5 in July and August, Leake has won two straight starts for the first time since June 12. It was also the ninth time in 29 starts this season that the right-hander has gone seven innings or more.	"It's kind of nice to see. I had to work to get down in the zone a little bit more," Leake said.	Angels starter Odrisamer Despaigne (0-3) went only one-plus inning, allowing three runs and four hits while facing eight batters. He promptly gave up two runs in the first as the first three batters reached base. Haniger led off the game with a double and was driven in two batters later when Cano singled. A sacrifice fly by Ryon Healy scored Denard Span.	"When you have a negative ball-strike ratio, you know things aren't going your way," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.	Haniger's sacrifice fly with the bases loaded in the second scored Ben Gamel and extended the lead to 3-0.	The Mariners added two runs in the ninth. Seager's single scored Cano, and Cruz came home on a bases-loaded walk.	Upton had two hits and Mike Trout added a pair of doubles for the Angels.	Los Angeles got a run in the ninth when Trout scored on Jose Fernandez's fielder's choice with the bases loaded.	ANOTHER MILESTONE	Trout became the fifth player in major league history and the second in the American League with seven seasons of 60 extra-base hits or more by his age 26 season. He joined Rodriguez, Orlando Cepeda, Frank Robinson and Mel Ott. Trout is batting .375 (18 for 48) over his last 15 games with three home runs and eight RBI.	BULLPEN GAMES	It was the second time in three games that the Angels essentially resorted to a bullpen game. Tuesday's was planned as eight pitchers combined on a two-hitter to beat Texas 1-0. Scioscia said Thursday that it's likely he will have to go with another bullpen game next week.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: SS Jean Segura missed his third straight game with a flu-like illness, according to Servais. Segura did take part in batting practice and could return to the lineup sometime this weekend. Left fielder Cameron Maybin was also out of the lineup for the second straight day due to illness.	Angels: Tyler Skaggs threw a 48-pitch simulated game in Arizona. The left-hander has been on the disabled list since Aug. 12 due to a groin strain. Scioscia said Skaggs will return to Anaheim to determine his next step.	UP NEXT	Mariners: With lefty James Paxton scratched due to pneumonia, Seattle had not announced a starter for Friday. Servais said it will be a bullpen game.	Angels: Matt Shoemaker (2-0, 3.45 ERA) will make his first start at home since June 14, 2017. The right-hander has missed most of the season after injuring his right forearm on March 31 against Oakland.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

BALTIMORE --  James Shields has dealt with some tough luck this season.	On a soggy Friday night, the pitcher nicknamed "Big Game James" turned in a solid start for the White Sox and was rewarded with some run support.	Shields picked up his first road victory since opening day in Chicago's 8-6 win over the Baltimore Orioles.	"This year's been kind of a struggle getting the (wins)," said Shields, who has gone at least six innings in 22 of his last 27 starts. "I've thrown a lot of quality starts this year and unfortunately it just hasn't gone my way. The guys are grinding for me. There's no doubt about that. I know that every guy in this clubhouse wants to score a bunch of runs for me."	Ryan Cordell earned his first career hit over 15 at-bats with an eighth-inning homer that provided an insurance run. Omar Narvaez and Avisail Garcia also homered for the White Sox, who won for the second time in nine games.	"I was probably pressing to get that first one," Cordell said. "It took quite a few ABs."	Shields (7-16), who leads the majors in losses, allowed two runs on four hits with five strikeouts and one walk over six innings. Shields had gone winless in his 12 previous road appearances.	Left-hander Aaron Bummer relieved Shields in the seventh and loaded the bases. Ian Hamilton entered with one out and allowed a two-run single to pinch-hitter Corban Joseph that pulled Baltimore within 7-4. A fielding error by second baseman Yoan Moncada allowed another run to score before Adam Jones hit a sacrifice fly.	Jace Fry contained the Orioles with a scoreless eighth, setting up Nate Jones to pick up his fifth save.	Luis Ortiz (0-1), obtained in the trade that sent Jonathan Schoop to Milwaukee on July 31, made his first major league start and threw 1 2/3 innings before leaving with a hamstring injury. He allowed three runs, one earned, and four hits with a walk.	"I wish he could have stayed out there and continued to pitch," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. "He's got late life and a good, sharp slider. He's got a chance to be pretty good."	Trey Mancini hit a pair of homers and has 23 on the season for the majors-worst Orioles, who lost their 105th game.	"We all want to go out every day and do well for the team first, and then on a personal level you want to go out and get results that you worked hard for," Mancini said. "We got 15 games left, and hopefully we can keep putting good at-bats together."	Chicago got on the board in the first on a two-out RBI single by Daniel Palka.	A triple by Nicky Delmonico and an infield single by Moncada increased the lead to 3-0, and Ortiz left a batter later. Moncada finished with three hits.	Mancini hit a solo shot in the second off Shields, who has allowed 31 homers on the season, second in the majors behind the Orioles' Dylan Bundy.	Narvaez answered in third with a two-run shot off Jimmy Yacabonis. Mancini hit another solo homer in the fourth that pulled Baltimore within 5-2.	Yacabonis allowed a two-run shot to Garcia in the fifth and exited two batters later.	ENDING FRUSTRATION?	The White Sox can take a season series against the Orioles for the first time since 2008 with a victory Saturday.	ROSTER MOVES	The Orioles recalled LHP Donnie Hart and RHP Evan Phillips from Triple-A Norfolk.	TRAINER'S ROOM	White Sox: INF Matt Davidson (sore legs) was available after missing the last three games. "If you look at the construction of my lineup, it's kind of hard for me to use him right now, but he's doing good," manager Rick Renteria said.	Orioles: INF Steve Wilkerson has been dealing with a hamstring issue but could return to the lineup Tuesday or Wednesday. He was recalled from Triple-A Norfolk on Sept. 5.	UP NEXT	White Sox: Reynaldo Lopez (5-9, 4.22 ERA) has allowed just four earned runs with 29 strikeouts over his last four starts.	Orioles: Rookie Yefry Ramirez (1-5, 5.94) is making his first major league start since Aug. 19, when he allowed seven runs and seven hits over three innings in an 8-0 loss to Cleveland.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

NEW YORK --  Aaron Judge's wrist got a big hand.	The reigning AL Rookie of the Year returned to right field for the first time since his right wrist was broken seven weeks ago, and the crowd of 40,138 at Yankee Stadium greeted him with a pair of standing ovations before the eighth inning of New York's 11-0 romp over the Toronto Blue Jays on Friday night.	"Pretty crazy," Judge said.	Masahiro Tanaka (12-5), bidding to start a likely wild-card game against Oakland, extended his scoreless streak to 20 innings and won his third straight start.	Judge did not have a chance in his two innings, and he is limited to defense and baserunning for now . Manager Aaron Boone said Judge could return as a fulltime player during this final homestand, which ends Sept. 23.	"I was nervous out there just standing in the outfield," Judge said. "Just getting those jitters out of the way now, it's good. So when I get that first at-bat, it'll be like I never left."	Judge had not played since July 26, when he was hit by a pitch from Kansas City's Jakob Junis . Judge said the wrist still has pain and won't heal fully until the offseason.	Judge high-fived a member of the grounds crew as fans applauded when he ran onto the field and was given another ovation a minute later when he was introduced by public address announcer Paul Olden. Judge ran to the base of the right-field wall after his warmup tosses -- just in front of the Judge's Chambers. He handed the ball to a woman in the first row who passed it to a widely smiling girl next to her.	"You could feel the buzz there," Boone said.	Before the ninth, Judge tossed his warmup ball into the upper deck. New York originally projected he would sidelined by the injury for three weeks, but pain lingered and he missed 45 games.	The tall, gregarious sophomore likely will have a simulated game next week before he bats in a real one.	"In the dugout, just having him there and his presence being there, is felt throughout the whole team," Andrew McCutchen said,	McCutchen hit his third home run since the Yankees acquired him from San Francisco on Aug. 31 for outfield depth, a move that allowed Giancarlo Stanton to be mostly a designated hitter. McCutchen doubled leading off the first and scored New York's first run and also singled and walked twice. To make room for Judge, McCutchen shifted to left for the first time since 2009 at Triple-A.	"I finally got to watch him and Stanton take batting practice, and I saw some pretty impressive stuff," McCutchen said. "I know the people who have been here all year, to them it's probably normal. It's not normal."	New York improved to 13-4 against Toronto this season and remained 1 1/2 games ahead of the Athletics for home field in the wild-card game on Oct. 3. Dominating with a sharp splitter, Tanaka struck out eight in six innings and allowed four hits . Luis Severino and J.A. Happ also are possible starters against the A'a.	"How they're pitching in the final two weeks certainly matters," Boone said. "We also take into account who we're playing, where we're playing."	Luke Voit hit a two-run double that capped a five-run first inning against Marco Estrada (7-12), who tied a career worst by allowing eight runs and lasted just 2 2/3 innings. Didi Gregorius added his 24th homer , one shy of his career high.	Toronto lost its fourth straight game and at 65-82 ensured consecutive losing seasons for first time since 2012-13.	"We're in a rebuild mode now, so you're going to take your lumps," manager John Gibbons said.	FINISHING	Luis Cessa got his second big league save . It was New York's largest shutout win margin since a 15-0 victory over the Mets on June 14, 2009.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Blue Jays: RHP Joe Biagini was activated from the 10-day DL after recovering from a strained left oblique that had sidelined him since Aug. 31 and pitched a one-hit seventh. Toronto also reinstated C Russell Martin from paternity leave.	Yankees: Injured closer Aroldis Chapman is to throw another bullpen session Saturday, a simulated game on Monday and then could be activated in the middle of next week, Chapman has not pitched in a game since Aug. 21 because of left knee tendinitis.	UP NEXT	LHP CC Sabathia (7-6, 3.54) starts for New York on Saturday and RHP Sean Reid-Foley (1-3, 6.86) for Toronto. Sabathia has pitched 139 2/3 innings and likely has four starts left. He would get a $500,000 bonus for 155 innings and another $500,000 in the unlikely event he reaches 165.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

PHILADELPHIA --  Confidence is a big deal for Aaron Altherr.	A couple more games like Friday night should help out a lot.	Altherr homered twice and drove in five runs, leading the Philadelphia Phillies to a 14-2 victory over the Miami Marlins.	The 27-year-old Altherr was expected to be a regular contributor for Philadelphia after he had 19 homers and 65 RBI in 107 games last season. But the outfielder struggled with his swing all spring and was sent down to Triple-A Lehigh Valley on July 22 after hitting just .171 with six homers.	Altherr connected for a two-run shot in the second for his first homer since June 6. He added a three-run drive in the fifth and finished with four hits.	"I didn't make any mechanical adjustments, didn't think about anything like that," Altherr said. "Just confidence was the biggest thing. I feel whenever you're confident up there at the plate, good things are going to happen."	Roman Quinn, Rhys Hoskins and Mitch Walding also connected for the Phillies, who snapped a five-game losing streak.	Philadelphia stayed 7 1/2 games back of NL East-leading Atlanta, which beat Washington 10-5 for its sixth straight win. The Phillies were in prime position to make the postseason before stumbling in recent weeks.	Zach Eflin (10-7) pitched 6 1/3 innings of one-run ball in his first win since Aug. 16. The right-hander was 0-3 with an 8.64 ERA in his last four appearances.	Eflin utilized his four-seam fastball more against the Marlins than in recent outings.	"You see how brilliant he can be," manager Gabe Kapler said.	J.T. Realmuto homered for Miami, which dropped its fourth straight. Wei-Yin Chen (6-11) was tagged for five runs and seven hits in four innings.	Quinn finished with two hits and three RBI after being sidelined by a small fracture in his right foot. He hit a solo drive in the second and drove in two runs with a bases-loaded fielder's choice in the fourth.	Chen struck out four and walked two in another slugging performance on the road. The left-hander is 5-3 with a 1.77 ERA in 12 home starts, but just 1-8 with a 9.29 ERA in 12 road starts.	"I guess I probably need to do some more homework for the games on the road," Chen said. "Maybe that's what I need to do."	DROUGHT'S OVER	After going 0 for 14 with 10 strikeouts, Walding recorded his first career hit when he homered off catcher Bryan Holaday in the ninth.	"I was speechless," Walding said. "Probably one of the happiest moments I've ever had in my life. "It was very special and something, obviously, I'll never forget the rest of my life."	HOMER HAPPY	Realmuto's homer was his 21st of the season -- and 18th when he is in the lineup as a catcher. He's one shy of matching the Marlins record for homers by a catcher in a season; Charles Johnson had 19 in games where he was behind the plate in 1997.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Marlins: Rookie OF Austin Dean returned to the lineup after missing both games of Thursday's doubleheader against the Mets due to illness. Dean went 2 for 4.	UP NEXT	RHP Vince Velasquez (9-11, 4.30) goes for Philadelphia on Saturday night in the second of a three-game set against the Marlins, who will be using a bevy of relievers.	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez. We break down the deal.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

BOSTON --  Noah Syndergaard was still wearing a plastic bib from a local seafood chain when he spoke to reporters after shutting down the Red Sox in his first-ever appearance at Fenway Park.	For the Mets, it was a feast all around.	Syndergaard pitched seven innings of three-hit ball, and New York hit four homers on Friday night to cool off the Red Sox 8-0 and snap Boston's four-game winning streak. The Mets right-hander struck out six and walked three to lead the Mets to their fourth straight victory and sixth win in their last seven games.	"That was just a fun ballgame on all fronts," Syndergaard (12-3) said. "The offense really came alive. The defense made some great plays behind me."	The Red Sox, who lead the majors with 101 victories, had their lead over the New York Yankees in the AL East reduced to 9 1/2 games. The only team in baseball to have already secured a playoff berth, Boston's magic number to clinch its third straight division title remained at six.	The Mets (69-78) are technically still alive in the NL East but could be eliminated as early as this weekend despite winning 25 of their last 40 games. A lot of the credit for the goes to Syndergaard, who has won 10 of his last 12 decisions, and Cy Young contender Jacob deGrom, who hasn't allowed more than three runs in 26 straight starts.	"You go through ups and downs, but overall it's been a pretty good rotation this season," manager Mickey Callaway said. "It's good that they're finishing strong."	Jay Bruce hit a three-run homer in the third, Austin Jackson hit a two-run shot in the eighth, and Jeff McNeil and Amed Rosario had solo shots for New York. McNeil and Brandon Nimmo made diving catches in the outfield, and Syndergaard won a footrace covering first base in the third inning to end Boston's only real threat.	Ian Kinsler singled and stole second, Jackie Bradley Jr. walked and they pulled off an uncontested double steal -- the only time in the game a Red Sox runner reached third base. Andrew Benintendi hit a grounder to second, and Syndergaard barely beat him to the bag as dove head-first.	The Mets starter also picked Kinsler off first in the seventh.	"He's got great stuff," Red Sox slugger J.D. Martinez said. "He throws hard. He's not just a chucker. He knows where the ball is going. He puts the ball where he wants it."	Bruce also had a run-scoring double in the first against Red Sox emergency starter William Cuevas, who was making his first major league start because Hector Velazquez got sick. Cuevas (0-1) allowed back-to-back doubles to Michael Conforto and Bruce in the first, and then left after giving up Rosario's leadoff single in the third.	Robby Scott hit Conforto with one out and then gave up Bruce's homer to right. McNeil made it 5-0 in the fourth and Jackson cleared the Green Monster and the billboards above it to give the Mets a 7-0 lead. One out later, Rosario also put one over the left-field wall to make it 8-0 and chase Tyler Thornburg.	RATS!	The Mets had an unwelcome visitor to their dugout in the fourth inning: a rat that sent the players scurrying away. No word on whether it was the same one that spooked the Red Sox in their dugout on Tuesday night. They paid tribute to their guest with a (presumably fake) rat skeleton on their dugout railing.	FAN SUPPORT	A healthy contingent of Mets fans helped boost the crowd of 37,117, Boston's 40th sellout of the year. They cheered the visiting team's homers, but both sides seemed united when the crowd broke out in a couple of "Yankees Suck!" chants.	"It was awesome, just the overall atmosphere, the history," said Syndergaard, who visited the Green Monster scoreboard before the game. "It's like pitching in a cathedral."	LATE SCRATCH	The Red Sox announced about four hours before the game that Velazquez was ill. Cuevas, who made 23 starts in Triple-A this year but had come out of the bullpen in all eight of his big-league appearances, allowed two runs on three hits in two-plus innings, walking one and striking out four.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Red Sox: RHP Matt Barnes (left hip inflammation) threw off a mound for the first time since his injury. He last pitched Sept. 3. ... Infielder Eduardo Nunez got the first of two scheduled games off, a day after an awkward stumble trying to beat a throw at first base.	UP NEXT	The teams play the second game of the series at 4 p.m. Saturday. RHP Rick Porcello (16-7) is scheduled to start for Boston against RHP Corey Oswalt (3-2).	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Detroit got a jump-start on the winter signings, landing lefty Eduardo Rodriguez.

CLEVELAND --  The Indians' sprint to another division title has turned into a crawl.	Andrew Miller gave up two RBI doubles in the seventh inning as Cleveland's march to a third straight AL Central championship was slowed by the Detroit Tigers, who beat the Indians 5-4 on Friday night to end a 10-game losing streak at Progressive Field.	The loss prevented the Indians from reducing their magic number to secure a postseason berth that has been a foregone conclusion for months. But Kansas City's win over second-place Minnesota dropped the Indians' number to one and they can celebrate with a win on Saturday.	Miller, making his third appearance since coming off the disabled list, relieved Adam Cimber (0-2) in the seventh, but couldn't stop the Tigers from snapping a 2-2 tie.	Jeimer Candelario, who homered in the first off Josh Tomlin, doubled home one run and Victor Martinez also doubled off Miller, a former All-Star who has been on the DL three times and has not been as dominant.	Lately, the wins have been less frequent for Cleveland. The Indians are just 5-8 in September and are not clicking on all cylinders with October coming quickly.	"But it's a long season and guys go through things throughout the course of the season," said Tomlin, the Indians' longest-tenured player. "We've all seen it. We're all just trying to get on the same page, just trying to play out style of baseball as much as we can. Once it clicks and once we get on a roll, it should be pretty good."	Down 5-2, the Indians scored twice in the ninth against closer Shane Greene, who finally retired Francisco Lindor on a fly to right with the tying run at second.	Josh Donaldson homered and went 2 for 4 in his home debut for Cleveland, and Edwin Encarnacion connected for his 31st homer.	Donaldson was pleased to contribute, even in a loss.	"It's been a while since I've had this type of adrenaline going through my body," said the 2015 AL MVP, who was sidelined for more than three months by a calf injury. "I've had to try to take a step back, breathe a little bit more, try to slow the game down. I've been pretty excited to be here and play the last couple games. To have a little bit of success tonight was nice."	Drew VerHagen (3-2) got two outs in the sixth and Greene worked a shaky ninth for his 29th save.	Tigers starter Matthew Boyd held the Indians to just one hit until the sixth, when former Toronto teammates Encarnacion and Donaldson tied it with consecutive homers.	First, Encarnacion hit a towering shot into the left-field seats.	After returning to the dugout following his "walking the parrot" home run ritual, Encarnacion had just peeled off his batting gloves when Donaldson got the green light on a 3-0 pitch and lifted it over the wall for his first hit in eight at-bats with the Indians.	The moment was one Cleveland fans are hoping to see again in October from Donaldson, who was acquired from the Blue Jays on Aug. 31.	HEAD'S UP PLAY	Detroit's JaCoby Jones scored what ended up being the winning run in the eighth inning on a daring play.	Jones was on second when a third strike went to the backstop. When Cleveland catcher Yan Gomes threw to first, Jones never stopped and scored with a headfirst slide into the plate.	"You have to have courage to be able to do things," manager Ron Gardenhire said. "You also have to have speed and good instincts. He's got those. That was really exciting. It pumped everybody up."	SLOW START	Tomlin made his first start for the Indians since May 21, but was in trouble right away. Candelario connected for a 422-foot homer on the game's third pitch.	It was the 23rd homer allowed by Tomlin in just 55 2/3 innings. Tomlin's habit of giving up homers was one of the reasons he was dropped from the rotation earlier this season, and perhaps why his career could be coming to a close.	TAKE COVER	Gardenhire was able to laugh after being struck on the left leg in the dugout by a screaming foul ball hit by Brian McCann in the sixth.	"It hit me right in the calf," said Gardenhire, who retreated to the other end of the dugout after being hit. "Not hard, but it hit me. That hasn't happened very much. I wasn't that fast when I was young, and I know I'm not now."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Tigers: INF Niko Goodrum (bruised left quad) was not in the lineup and could miss several days. While playing shortstop on Wednesday, Goodrum collided with left fielder Christin Stewart while chasing a fly ball.	Indians: RHP Trevor Bauer will pitch off the mound Saturday as recovers from a broken leg that has sidelined him since Aug. 11. Manager Terry Francona said Bauer recovered nicely after throwing 20 to 25 pitches in a bullpen session on Wednesday and the team is encouraged by his progress. Bauer will soon begin a regular running routine and undergo another MRI.	UP NEXT	Mike Clevinger, who is 6-1 with a 2.15 ERA against AL Central teams, makes his third start this season against the Tigers. Michael Fulmer goes for Detroit.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.

Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

ST .PETERSBURG, Fla. --  Khris Davis helped Oakland win another close one.	Davis led off the 10th inning with his major league-leading 42nd homer, and the Athletics beat the Tampa Bay Rays 2-1 on Friday night.	"I've always said he's one swing away from winning a game for you," A's manager Bob Melvin said. "He's developed a knack for hitting good pitching and hitting dramatic homers late in games."	Oakland improved its majors-best record in one-run games to 29-12 and extended its lead for the second AL wild card to nine games over the surprising Rays. Tampa Bay has 16 games left.	The A's remained 1 1/2 games behind the New York Yankees for the first wild card. The Yankees beat Toronto 11-0.	"We're competing for a spot. Every game is precious," Davis said.	Davis' drive to center off Jaime Schultz (2-1) was his 40th this season as a designated hitter. He joins David Ortiz has the only DHs to have 40 or more homers.	Davis set an Oakland record with his 16th homer in the seventh inning or later.	The A's had just three hits against nine Tampa Bay pitchers.	"Today stunk just in the fact that we had an opportunity and we didn't capitalize," Rays manager Kevin Cash said. "It's tough to pull negatives from what this group has done and how they performed tonight."	Blake Treinen (7-2) went two scoreless innings for the win.	Matt Chapman doubled for the first A's hit with one out in the fourth and scored on Matt Olson's single.	Tampa Bay tied it later in the fourth when Tommy Pham extended his hitting streak to 17 games with a pop-fly double into shallow center field and crossed the plate on Joey Wendle's base hit.	"They didn't give us much," Rays third baseman Matt Duffy said. "A close, hard-fought game."	Oakland reliever Shawn Kelley worked out of a second-and-third, no-out jam in the sixth.	"That was a Houdini inning," Melvin said.	Athletics starter Edwin Jackson allowed one run and four hits in five innings.	Reliever Diego Castillo opened the game for the Rays and struck out four over two perfect innings.	Sergio Romo retired all three batters in the ninth in his second appearance for the Rays since Aug. 25. He recorded a two-out save on Sept. 4 at Toronto.	The Athletics are 12-5 in extra innings.	"It's fun baseball that we're playing right now and every day it's a different person coming through in clutch situations," Jackson said.	MAKING A CASE FOR CY	The Rays have put out a handbill supporting Blake Snell's AL Cy Young Award bid titled "Attack of the Cy Zilla!" It includes a quote from Boston manager Alex Cora saying Snell has "been great against everybody." Red Sox lefty Chris Sale is also a contender. Snell, whose nickname is Snellzilla, leads the majors with 19 wins.	TOUGH LOSSES	Tampa Bay is 25-29 in one-run games. ... It was the Rays' 14th loss when allowing two runs or fewer, which is most in the majors.	NUMBERS	Chapman has 23 doubles and 38 extra-base hits since the All-Star break. ... Oakland C Jonathan Lucrory threw out two runners on stolen base attempts. ... Athletics RF Stephen Piscotty had his 14-game hitting streak end after going 0 for 4.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Athletics: RHP Trevor Cahill (upper back) will miss his next scheduled start. "He had a trigger-point injection," Melvin said. "Hopefully that alleviates it."	Rays: Duffy (lower back) started after being out of the lineup the previous three games. "I don't think the pain is completely out of there but he wants to be in there," Cash said.	UP NEXT	Tampa Bay and Oakland, two of the primary teams using relievers as openers to start games, will employ the strategy against each other for the first time Saturday night. "It's just trying to take advantage of what you have," Melvin said. Tampa Bay will go with RHP Ryne Stanek (2-3), while Oakland counters with RHP Liam Hendriks (0-1).	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

ATLANTA --  Ronald Acuna Jr. struck out twice and reached base once in his first six at-bats against Nationals ace Max Scherzer.	"I think it helps having some previous at-bats against him," Acuna said through a translator. "I just went in with the same approach. I wanted to have fun out there on the field and have good at-bats."	Acuna went 4 for 5, had two RBI and scored the tiebreaking run in the fourth inning to help the NL East-leading Atlanta Braves win their season-best sixth straight game with a 10-5 victory over the Washington Nationals on Friday night.	The Braves stayed 7 1/2 games ahead of second-place Philadelphia. Any combination of nine Atlanta victories or Phillies' losses will give the Braves their first division title since 2013.	Scherzer (17-7) endured his shortest outing of the year, four innings, while allowing six runs -- a season high -- and seven hits in 102 pitches.	Scherzer, a three-time Cy Young Award winner, was no match for Acuna, one of baseball's hottest hitters since the All-Star break.	The 20-year-old left fielder doubled off the wall in his first at-bat. He drove in two runs with a bloop single in the second. He tripled and scored the tiebreaking run on a sacrifice fly in the fourth. His single in the eighth gave Acuna a single-game high in hits.	Juan Soto, Washington's 19-year-old left fielder, was impressive, too, homering in his fourth straight game and running a long way to catch a liner in the third. Soto scored the game's first run in the second after beating a tag on Acuna's throw to third. His 20th homer was a solo shot in the fourth.	"I would say I'm definitely having fun sharing the field with him," Acuna said, "but I'm always going out there to have a good time on the field every time."	The third-place Nationals had won four of five, but they dropped to 74-74 and can be eliminated from the division race by any combination of six Atlanta wins or Washington losses.	Kevin Gausman (10-10) gave up seven hits, two walks and four runs -- three earned -- in 5 2/3 innings. Gausman improved to 5-2 with a 2.61 ERA in eight starts since the Braves acquired him in a trade with Baltimore.	Scherzer, the majors' active career leader in strikeouts, threw 31 pitches in the second, the worst coming on a two-out, eight-pitch walk to Gausman that loaded the bases. Acuna, the next batter, fought off a slider on his hands to drop the ball into shallow right field and make it 2-all.	"I think with a pitcher of his stature, the only way you're going to get to him really is to tire him out," Gausman said. "It was pretty hot, and when you have a long inning like that -- yeah, the guys were stringing together some pretty good at-bats and made him work."	Scherzer was sweating so profusely in the second that he had to replace his hat after Acuna's hit. Sweat was rolling off the bill of his cap, affecting Scherzer's vision, and he appeared to be struggling with his grip on the ball.	"I wasn't able to get in rhythm," Scherzer said. "I never felt I had good command of any of my pitches. I could never get in sync."	Atlanta led 4-2 in the third on Tyler Flowers' two-run single. After Soto's homer and Wilmer Difo's RBI double forced a tie in the fourth, Acuna answered in the bottom half of the inning, tripling and scoring on Freeman's sacrifice fly. Markakis' RBI single put Atlanta up 6-4.	Charlie Culberson's infield RBI single put the Braves up 7-4 in the sixth. Bryce Harper had an RBI groundout in the sixth for Washington. Markakis drove in two of the Braves' three runs in the eighth.	HE SAID, HE SAID	Washington slugger Bryce Harper and home plate umpire Laz Diaz were arguing with each other much of the night. It started when Harper disagreed with a call in the fifth and continued when Harper was in center field as they yelled at each other during the next inning. It stopped short of reaching a boiling point in the seventh when Diaz called a strike on a pitch that was clearly off the plate. Harper argued with Diaz while looking straight ahead, not making eye contact with the umpire. Nationals manager Dave Martinez came from the dugout to back Harper, but Diaz did not eject either.	"I'm not going to make any comment on balls and strikes there, but umpires are supposed to be non-confrontational," Martinez said. "They're supposed to uphold the peace on the baseball field. For me MLB needs to take a look at that. . (Diaz) is saying things to Harp, and I thought that was uncalled for."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Atlanta 3B Johan Camargo missed his second straight game with left groin tightness. ... The Braves returned RHP Arodys Vizcaino from a rehab assignment and reinstated him from the 60-day disabled list. Manager Brian Snitker said Vizcaino, the team's closer during parts of each of the last three years, will not be used in high leverage situations immediately. Vizcaino missed 63 games with right shoulder inflammation.	TIME GONE BY	The 3 hour, 54-minute game was the longest nine-inning game Atlanta has played since April 10, 2016 against St. Louis. The last time the Braves played a longer game without needing a bottom of the ninth was June 3, 2000 against the Yankees.	UP NEXT	Nationals: RHP Jeremy Hellickson (5-3, 3.57 ERA) will make his 19th start and first since Aug. 15 at St. Louis. He missed 21 games with a right wrist sprain and was sidelined 22 games earlier this year with a right hamstring strain. Hellickson is 2-0 with a 3.18 ERA in six career starts against Atlanta.	Braves: RHP Julio Teheran (9-7, 3.95 ERA) will make his 29th start. Atlanta has won three of his last five outings. Teheran has been hit hard by the Nationals this year, going 0-1 with a 7.56 ERA in two starts. He is 6-5 with a 4.12 ERA in 20 career starts against Washington.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third base coach on Monday.

ST. LOUIS --  In a pivotal series for the Dodgers, rookie Walker Buehler came through with a masterful performance.	Buehler allowed two hits in eight innings, Yasiel Puig homered twice and Los Angeles drew even with the St. Louis Cardinals in the NL wild-card race with a 3-0 victory on Friday night. The Dodgers also moved within one-half game of first-place Colorado in the NL West.	Buehler (7-5) pitched beyond the seventh inning for the first time and earned his first victory since Aug. 17. He retired the first 13 batters before Paul DeJong singled to left field. Harrison Bader singled later in the fifth for the Cardinals' only other hit.	"This was probably the best pitching performance of the year," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. "Not only Walker but across the board. Against a very good club in St. Louis on the road and obviously what's at stake right now for each game. He wanted this moment and just coming out firing. His command. Just domination. He kind of did what he wanted to do tonight."	Buehler struck out nine and walked two. In two career starts against St. Louis, the right-hander has not allowed a run and has 18 strikeouts in 15 innings.	"He's got some serious weapons," Cardinals manager Mike Shildt said. "He's throwing 97-98 (mph), with command. When you can locate your fastball, regardless of velocity, that's a nice weapon. Then you do it with that velocity and then you do it with some cut. And his cutter, at least from the side, it looked like it had some depth. Then second time through the lineup, start mixing in a changeup and hitting with that, that's a pretty potent weaponry right there."	The Dodgers and Cardinals are tied for the second NL wild-card position, four games behind Milwaukee for the top spot. But Los Angeles has its sights on the division crown and moved closer when the Rockies lost to San Francisco.	"Sometimes there's teams you match up well against," Buehler said. "It's hard to explain. It's just the way the game works and luckily tonight that worked out."	Puig homered in the second off Jack Flaherty (8-7) and connected again in the ninth off Tyler Webb. It was his second multi-homer game of the season.	"I was trying to do my best," Puig said through a translator. "He threw a fastball there and I was able to connect with it. I can hit lefties sometimes and right there I was trying to find something up in the zone. I wasn't expecting a home run but it happened."	In the seventh, Cody Bellinger scored on a passed ball by Yadier Molina.	Kenley Jansen hit Yairo Munoz with a pitch to open the ninth but retired the next three batters to finish the two-hitter, earning his 35th save in 39 opportunities.	Flaherty worked six innings, allowing one run on four hits with two walks and eight strikeouts. He has 168 strikeouts this season, the fourth-best total for a rookie in franchise history.	"We want to win. I don't care about my line. I don't care about anything other than winning," Flaherty said. "It doesn't matter how I pitched, I didn't pitch well enough. He pitched better than I did."	TRAINER'S ROOM	Dodgers: Relievers John Axford and Tony Cingrani were scheduled to pitch in the California Championship Series for Single-A Rancho Cucamonga on Friday night. "They're stacking the deck, trying to help them make their playoff push," Roberts joked. "They're supposed to go an inning each. We'll see how they come out of it. Our hope is to get these guys back." Axford could return to the majors after one appearance, while Cingrani (shoulder) would likely need more rehab work.	Cardinals: IF Jedd Gyorko is likely to return to the starting lineup Saturday, manager Mike Shildt said. He drew a pinch-hit walk in the eighth inning and was replaced by pinch-runner Adolis Garcia.	UP NEXT	The Cardinals send right-hander John Gant (7-5, 3.16 ERA) to the mound Saturday afternoon to make his third career appearance and first start against Los Angeles. Veteran lefty Rich Hill (8-5, 3.88) starts for the Dodgers.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers for NL Rookie of the Year.

CHICAGO --  With Pedro Strop sidelined by a hamstring injury, Chicago Cubs manager Joe Maddon gave the ball to Jorge De La Rosa for the ninth inning.	And it worked.	The 37-year-old De La Rosa got three outs for his first career save, helping the Cubs top the Cincinnati Reds 3-2 on Friday night.	Ian Happ hit a three-run homer in the seventh inning as NL Central-leading Chicago stayed 1 1/2 games ahead of second-place Milwaukee, which posted a 7-4 victory over Pittsburgh. Ben Zobrist had three hits, and Dillon Maples (1-0) earned his first career win.	De La Rosa surrendered a one-out double to Curt Casali and walked Billy Hamilton with two down before Scott Schebler flied out to center. It was the first save opportunity for Chicago since Strop strained his left hamstring trying to beat out a double-play grounder during Thursday's 4-3 victory at Washington, shelving the key reliever for the rest of the regular season.	Strop had been subbing for closer Brandon Morrow, who is on the disabled list with a right arm injury.	After Cole Hamels allowed two runs over 6 2/3 innings, Maples got the final out of the seventh, Jaime Garcia tossed a perfect eighth and De La Rosa closed it out in his 426th major league appearance.	Maddon called it an "unlikely bullpen."	"The walk to Hamilton made it interesting, but (De La Rosa) had great composure," he said. "First big league save, wow. Good for him."	Happ's homer was just his second in 22 games. The 24-year-old switch hitter is batting .186 over the span.	"It's been a while since I've had one of those," Happ said. "To get a hit in that situation coming off what we've had to do the last couple of weeks, to give us a chance to win a ballgame, it was great."	Cincinnati had won four of six, including two of three against the contending Los Angeles Dodgers. The last-place Reds wasted a terrific start by Matt Harvey, who struck out six in six scoreless innings.	"It was just about getting ahead," Harvey said. "The big thing was being able to mix different pitches for a strike and really throw it whenever I wanted to.	"That was the first time in a long time that all four pitches were kind of doing exactly what I wanted to."	Cincinnati jumped in front on consecutive homers by Jose Peraza and Joey Votto in the fourth, but Chicago rallied after Harvey was replaced by David Hernandez (5-1).	Victor Caratini led off the seventh with a single and David Bote reached on an error on third baseman Eugenio Suarez. After pinch-hitter Tommy La Stella hit into a forceout, Happ drove a 1-0 pitch into the bleachers in left-center.	Hamels struck out seven to increase his career total to 2,396, matching Sandy Koufax for 48th on the all-time list. He is 4-0 in nine starts since he was acquired in a trade with Texas.	CLOSER CONUNDRUM	Strop had 11 saves in 13 opportunities since Morrow went on the DL in July. He is 6-1 with a 2.26 ERA over 59 2/3 innings in 60 appearances.	Unless the Cubs can make a trade, Maddon said he envisions using a closer-by-committee approach, including veterans Steve Cishek, Justin Wilson and Jesse Chavez.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Reds: RHP Lucas Sims is sidelined with a strain on his right side. "He's got little something going on with his lat that he's not available to pitch right now," manager Jim Riggleman said.	Cubs: Morrow (right biceps inflammation) is scheduled to throw a simulated game on Saturday. ... Maddon said OF Jason Heyward (right hamstring tightness) might return next week.	UP NEXT	Reds LHP Cody Reed (0-2, 5.08 ERA) faces Cubs ace Jon Lester (15-6, 3.57 ERA) on Saturday. Lester lost his last start on Monday to Milwaukee, exiting after 5 2/3 innings with lower back tightness.	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Randy Arozarena hit 20 home runs and stole 20 bases this season, leading all rookies with a 4.1 WAR.	Take a look back at the best plays from NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India's 2021 campaign.	Julio Lugo, who played for seven teams in a 12-year major league career, has died. He was 45.	Jonathan India finished ahead of Cardinals OF Dylan Carlson and Marlins starter Trevor Rogers.

MILWAUKEE --  The Milwaukee Brewers played long ball with homers by Christian Yelich, Travis Shaw and Mike Moustakas. It was a small-ball play by Orlando Arcia that was the game-changer.	With the Brewers clinging to a one-run lead in the sixth, Arcia pushed a bunt down the first-base line past Pittsburgh first baseman Josh Bell for a two-run double in a 7-4 victory over the Pirates on Friday night.	"I just knew that run was important and we needed to find a way to get it in," Arcia said through translator Carlos Brizuela. "I was just trying to hit it on the ground that way. I wasn't really trying to get it over the bag, but I'm glad I did."	Arcia added two other hits and helped the Brewers stay 1  1/2 games behind first-place Chicago in the NL Central.	Yelich belted a two-run homer to center off Pirates starter Chris Archer in the first to give the Brewers an early lead. Shaw followed two batters later with a solo shot to stake Milwaukee to a 3-0 advantage.	The Pirates threatened in the second. With a runner on and one out, Cain leaped above the wall in center, robbing Jordy Mercer of a home run.	"He's doing things all over the field. He's making his presence felt," Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said. "It's something to behold."	Shaw agreed.	"He's just impressive to watch. Defensively, he's made so many of those plays this year, it's hard to keep track," Shaw said.	Pittsburgh broke through in the third against Milwaukee starter Gio Gonzalez on Jordan Ludlow's run-scoring triple. Ludlow then scored on Francisco Cervelli's sacrifice fly.	Pablo Reyes' first career homer, a solo shot in the fifth, tied the score.	"He's got no fear in his swing. He likes to hit, he likes to swing the bat," Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said. "He's a young kid, getting an opportunity."	The Brewers regained the lead in the bottom half of the inning on a sacrifice fly by Jesus Aguilar.	Milwaukee extended the lead to 6-3 on Arcia's bunt against Pirates reliever Steven Brault. Arcia then stole third, but was cut down at the plate trying to score on Cain's grounder to short.	Moustakas' solo home run into the second deck in right in the seventh gave the Brewers a four-run advantage.	Pittsburgh pulled within 7-4 in the eighth on Josh Harrison's RBI double.	Corbin Burnes (5-0) picked up the win in relief. Jeremy Jeffress pitched a scoreless ninth to record his 12th save in 17 chances.	Gonzalez, making his second start for the Brewers since being acquired from the Washington Nationals, gave up three hits and three runs in 4 2/3 innings.	Archer surrendered six hits and four runs in five innings. He slipped to 1/3 in the National League and 4-8 this season after being traded from the Rays in July.	REPLACING POLANCO	With Polanco out of the lineup, four players will compete for time in right field, Hurdle said. Adam Frazier, Jordan Luplow, Pablo Reyes and rookie Kevin Kramer, who was called up Sept. 4, likely will share right-field duties for the remainder of the season.	"It's going to be a daily decision on who we want to play second base and do we want to move Kramer to third base," Hurdle said. "We did that the other day."	Luplow got the start in right on Friday night.	CONTRACT EXTENSION	The Brewers and the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers, their Class A affiliate, agreed on a contract extension that will run through the 2022 season.	"One of the best minor league relationships I've ever been a part of. It's a first-class organization," Brewers general manager David Stearns said.	MAGIC NUMBER	Yelich and Shaw belted their 29th homers of the season in the first inning. Yelich has reached base in 29 consecutive games, the longest current streak in the National League.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Pirates: OF Gregory Polanco is expected to be out seven to nine months after undergoing surgery on Wednesday to repair the labrum and stabilize his left shoulder. Polanco dislocated his shoulder on awkward slide into second base last Friday against Miami. "Now is the healing, the rehab, and the strengthening and then the getting ready to play, whenever that is," manager Clint Hurdle said. . RHP Chad Kuhl, on the disabled list since June with forearm and elbow tightness, is scheduled to re-examined after being unable to throw his scheduled side session earlier this week. ... A fifth-inning liner off the bat of Orlando Arcia struck Archer in the right buttock. The pitcher had trouble standing at first, but remained in the game. ... Starling Marte was struck by a pitch on the left elbow in the seventh. He stayed in the game after being checked by a trainer.	UP NEXT	Pirates: Ivan Nova (8-9, 4.17 ERA) is 2-2 with a 3.03 ERA in six career starts against Milwaukee.	Brewers: Zach Davies (2-5, 4.75) is 2/3 with a 6.49 ERA in seven career starts versus Pittsburgh.	---	More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball	The Yankees hired former Mets manager Luis Rojas as their new third-base coach on Monday.

HOUSTON --  In a stretch where the Arizona Diamondbacks feel like things haven't been going their way, a lucky break on Friday night helped them to a much-needed win.	Pinch-hitter Jon Jay's tiebreaking triple in the eighth inning sent them past the Houston Astros 4-2, tightening a pair of playoff races.	The AL West-leading Astros had their edge cut by Oakland to 2  1/2 games. Arizona moved within three games of St. Louis and Los Angeles for the second NL wild-card spot.	It was 2-all when Nick Ahmed doubled off Hector Rondon (2-4) with one out in the Arizona eighth. Jay hit a two-out, tiebreaking drive into the right field corner and later scored when a flyball by A.J. Pollock dropped in shallow center field for a single.	The triple by Jay came on a ball he said hit twice off his bat and that he thought was probably going to be foul.	"It kind of hooked back and that's when I realized what had happened and I just ran," Jay said. "It fell through and ... that was a big break for us right there. We needed it."	Manager Torey Lovullo was impressed with the way his team persevered.	"I know that we've been dealing with some frustrating circumstances," he said. "For us to come out against the world champs and play the way we did, I was really proud of these guys."	Arizona starter Robbie Ray yielded two hits and two runs with six strikeouts in 5 1/3 innings. Brad Ziegler (2-6) pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings and Yoshihisa Hirano allowed one hit in a scoreless ninth for his second save.	David Peralta had three hits and drove in two runs and Paul Goldschmidt doubled twice for Arizona.	Astros starter Dallas Keuchel allowed five hits and two runs in six innings.	Ray retired 13 of the last 14 batters he faced with Houston's only baserunner in that span coming when he walked Carlos Correa with one out in the fourth.	"It was frustrating," manager A.J. Hinch said. "We didn't do a ton between the first inning and the sixth inning, offensively. Ray settled in and flashed his good stuff. We did get a couple of opportunities but just couldn't break through with the big hit."	The Diamondbacks scored twice in the first when Eduardo Escobar walked, Goldschmidt hit a ground-rule double and Peralta followed with a single.	Houston came back with two in the bottom half. George Springer led off with a single, Jose Altuve and Alex Bregman walked to load the bases and Yuli Gurriel hit an RBI single. A double-play grounder by Correa tied it.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Diamondbacks: RHP Clay Buchholz, scratched from his scheduled start on Thursday with tightness in his right elbow, has a flexor strain in his right forearm and Lovullo said after the game that he won't pitch again this season. He added that he'd have more information about his condition in the coming days. ... LHP T.J. McFarland has inflammation of a bone spur around his elbow, but Lovullo said he doesn't think that it will keep him out long.	TRIPLES ON TRIPLES	Jay's triple was his fifth with the Diamondbacks this season and seventh overall. It also gave Arizona 46 triples this season which leads the majors.	SIPP KEEPS STRANDING	Houston left-hander Tony Sipp struck out David Peralta with two runners in scoring position in the seventh inning on Friday night. He's now stranded 31 of 35 runners he's inherited this season, which is the third-highest percentage in the majors.	UP NEXT	Houston's Charlie Morton (14-3, 3.15 ERA) opposes Arizona's Zack Godley (14-9, 4.67) when the series continues Saturday night. Morton has won two straight and tied his career high for wins. Godley has dropped two in a row and allowed seven hits and five runs in four innings of a loss to the Rockies in his last start.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	Randy Arozarena celebrates with his family at home after learning he won the 2021 AL Rookie of the Year.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  It has been one rough year for the Kansas City Royals.	Not this night, though. This one was fun.	Salvador Perez capped Kansas City's five-run ninth inning with a game-ending grand slam, lifting the Royals to an 8-4 victory over the Minnesota Twins on Friday.	Rosell Herrera sparked the winning rally with a one-out double off Trevor Hildenberger (4-4), who took over as Minnesota's closer after Fernando Rodney was traded to Oakland last month. Whit Merrifield followed with an RBI single and advanced to third on Adalberto Mondesi's base hit.	Manager Paul Molitor then put in Logan Forsythe, giving the Twins five infielders, and Alex Gordon was intentionally walked to load the bases. But Perez thwarted the strategy with a drive to center for his 26th homer.	"I was sitting on a slider," Perez said. "It surprised me a lot when he threw me a fastball first pitch right down the middle, but after that I was just trying to do my best to put the ball in play and see what happens."	The Twins' loss lowered Cleveland's magic number for clinching the AL Central title to one.	"We know Perez is a Twins killer and all those kind of things, but it would have been a little bit trickier to try to find a way to do that with Gordon," Molitor said. "So, we went ahead and gave it a shot and he did a good job of fouling off some tough pitches and working it to 3-2, and we had to throw a strike."	It was Perez's second career game-ending homer and the sixth game-ending slam in Royals history. Perez said he was so focused on trying to hit the ball in the air he didn't realize there were five infielders until the third pitch.	"As soon as I hit it, I knew we were going to bring him in (with the winning run)," Perez said. "If it had hit the wall, I didn't care. I just wanted to win. But as soon as I saw the ball going, I got more excited."	Last-place Kansas City improved to 12-2 in its last 14 home games after going 11-35 at Kauffman Stadium before the All-Star break.	"It's getting fun again," Royals manager Ned Yost said. "For a while, it wasn't a whole lot of fun, but you just keep your head up and keep working. But it's starting to get fun again."	Perez also had an RBI single in the first inning and Mondesi connected for his eighth homer in the seventh, a 437-foot drive into the right-field fountains. Jason Hammel (3-13) pitched a scoreless inning for the win.	Robbie Grossman and Willians Astudillo each had three hits for Minnesota, which also dropped the opener of the four-game set on Thursday.	Joe Mauer had a run-scoring double in the Twins' three-run fifth, and Astudillo made it 4-2 when he singled in Grossman in the seventh.	But Mondesi went deep in the bottom half of the inning and the Royals nearly tied it in the eighth. Ryan O'Hearn tried to score from first on Jorge Bonifacio's two-out double, but Astudillo made a diving tag to get him at the plate.	"That was a great send right there," Yost said. "You hate the outcome. You don't really want him thrown out, but I'm thinking if I'm coaching at third base I'm sending him right there, too. You've got to make them make that play."	Minnesota wasted a solid start by Jose Berrios, who struck out nine while pitching six innings of two-run ball.	Kansas City right-hander Jorge Lopez was charged with three runs and nine hits in 4 1/3 innings. He departed with a left rib contusion after a fourth-inning collision with third baseman Hunter Dozier.	"He hit me right here in the chest," Lopez said, lifting his shirt to reveal a bandage just below his left pectoral muscle. "I just reacted to that ball and didn't know he was going to go that far. I should not be there."	WORTH NOTING	Mauer's double was his 598th extra-base hit, breaking a tie with Tony Oliva for fourth place on the Twins' career list. He trails only Harmon Killebrew (728), Kirby Puckett (687) and Kent Hrbek (623).	TRAINER'S ROOM	Royals: After taking Dozier's shoulder to the ribs, Lopez said he started having difficulty breathing, especially when taking a deep breath. He will have an MRI on Saturday and will be re-evaluated by the training staff.	Twins: C Mitch Garver (head) remained sidelined for a second straight game while he awaits clearance from the training staff after taking a foul ball off the facemask, but he did hit in the cage before Friday's game. "I think that's another step forward today," Molitor said. ... 3B Miguel Sano (lower left leg) was expected to work in the batting cage for a second consecutive day, but he remains out indefinitely.	UP NEXT	Royals RHP Ian Kennedy (1-8, 4.92 ERA) will make his second start since returning from the disabled list and second straight start against the Twins, who send RHP Chase De Jong (0-0, 0.00) to the mound for his second appearance since a July 30 trade with the Seattle Mariners.	---	More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports	From MVP to Cy Young and more, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.

ANAHEIM, Calif. --  Dee Gordon did a happy dance while sitting on the warning track, and the display that was at least nine months in the making inspired an ear-to-ear grin long after it happened.	Gordon not only robbed Mike Trout of extra bases in center field during the fourth inning Friday, he delivered some insurance runs with a two-run single in the seventh during the Seattle Mariners' 5-0 victory over the Los Angeles Angels.	Asked if the two-run single or the catch made his day, Gordon answered "the catch," as if he anticipated the question.	"That was pretty cool; that was like the first one in my life," said Gordon, who insisted his glove was over the wall, robbing Trout of his 34th home run. "I was happy."	The catch, by a player who has primarily been a middle infielder, ended up preserving a shutout that was fashioned by six relief pitchers. The bullpen day was needed to fill in for scheduled starter James Paxton, who is dealing with a bout of pneumonia.	Roenis Elias gave up just one hit over 3 2/3 innings as the starter. Adam Warren (3-2) got four outs and Shawn Armstrong, Nick Vincent, Zach Duke and Ryan Cook each pitched an inning.	Making just his third start of the season and first since Aug. 19, Elias struck out four and walked two while throwing 58 pitches. In seven previous innings against the Angels this season, Elias had given up one run on six hits with three strikeouts, all in relief.	Elias said he found out he was starting at around before noon Friday.	"They didn't give me a lot of time but I was ready because I knew something could happen," Elias said through an interpreter.	The Mariners went ahead to stay against Matt Shoemaker in the fourth inning. Robinson Cano singled in Mitch Haniger for his 13th RBI in 27 games since being reinstated from an 80-game drug suspension.	With two out and runners on second and third, Ryon Healy made it 3-0 with a ground ball into left field.	That early Mariners momentum was preserved when Gordon made the kind of catch he had been dreading when he worked on his outfield play in the offseason. Knowing he might play some outfield this season, Gordon worked briefly on catches against a chain-link fence, but quickly abandoned the workouts.	His dance after making the catch, then, was a combination of relief and a sense accomplishment.	"He likes to celebrate and he is the king of celebration," Mariners manager Scott Servias said. "I think it's great. He does enjoy it and he should. It's a hard game and when something goes your way, or you make a great play, you have to have fun with it."	The Mariners have won the first two games of the series to improve to 10-7 against Angels, clinching the season series. The Mariners won consecutive games for the first time since Aug. 24-25.	ALL GOOD FOR SHOEMAKER	In his third start since coming off the disabled list after being sidelined by a right forearm strain, Shoemaker (2-1) went 4 2/3 innings. He threw just 77 pitches as the Angels try to limit his usage.	The right-hander was visited by manager Mike Scioscia and a member of the Angels medical staff in the fifth inning, but remained in the game. In 14 2/3 innings since returning from the DL, Shoemaker has a 3.68 ERA.	"Everything is all good," Shoemaker said. "I think probably just in that fourth inning, I haven't had a long inning like that in a long time, so I was a little tired going out to the fifth. After the first hitter, it wore off, the adrenaline kicked in and I got back into rhythm."	ANGELS IN SUMMARY	Trout was named team MVP, and left-hander Andrew Heaney received the Nick Adenhart Award winner for excellence both off the field and on the mound. Adenhart was an Angels rookie pitcher in 2009 when he was killed in a car crash following his first start of the season.	The Angels also announced Friday they have surpassed the 3 million mark in tickets sold, reaching the milestone for the 16th consecutive season.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Mariners: SS Jean Segura returned to the starting lineup after missing three games with a virus. ... OF Cameron Maybin is with the team but remains out of action with an unspecified illness. ... Paxton is expected to rejoin the team in a few days. ... RHP Felix Hernandez (hamstring) is expected to return to the rotation before the end of the season.	Angels: LHP Tyler Skaggs (left adductor strain) will rejoin the Angels on Saturday, when he will be evaluated to see if he can return to the rotation next week.	UP NEXT	Mariners RHP Erasmo Ramirez (2-3, 5.31 ERA) and Heaney (9-9, 3.98 ERA) pitch on Saturday. Ramirez is 2-1 with a 3.68 ERA in six starts since coming off the disabled list after being sidelined by a strained right shoulder. Heaney struck out a career-high 12 in seven scoreless innings in a 1-0 victory against the Chicago White Sox last Sunday.	In a free-agent field filled with future Hall of Famers, Detroit added one of the most undervalued pitchers available this winter.	Joon Lee breaks down how Eduardo Rodriguez signing with Detroit affects the Tigers and Red Sox.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.

SAN DIEGO --  Using an "opener" for an inning ahead of a traditional starter worked so well for the Texas Rangers on Friday night that they'll do it again on Saturday night.	Yohander Mendez followed opener and fellow rookie Connor Sadzeck by scattering three hits in five relief innings and Jurickson Profar had a two-run home run among his three hits to lead the Rangers to a 4-0 victory against the San Diego Padres.	Having Sadzeck pitch the first inning allowed the 23-year-old Mendez to pitch into the sixth, when he struck out Eric Hosmer with runners on first and second to end the inning.	"I thought Mendez did a great job tonight," manager Jeff Banister said. "It was a huge moment in the sixth, the at-bat against Hosmer. Really it was one of those grow-up moments for a young pitcher that felt like it was an opportunity for him to put a foot down and make some pitches."	Mendez was facing Hosmer for the third time and got him to swing at a change-up for strike three.	"I say, `That's going to my last hitter. Going to be best opportunity to strike him out or get a ground ball,'" Mendez said. "For me it's great ... For me it's better, my third time that I did like I did. I feel good."	Mendez (2-1) struck out five, walked three and was backed by two double plays. Four Rangers pitchers combined to five-hit San Diego.	The 23-year-old left-hander originally had been penciled in to make his third start since being recalled on Sept. 2 for his third big league stint this year, but the team then decided to have him follow Sadzeck, a 26-year-old rookie who made his first start.	Sadzeck walked leadoff batter Francisco Mejia, a rookie playing for the first time at Petco Park, before getting Wil Myers to ground into a double play and Hunter Renfroe to ground out to end the inning.	"It flips the lineup," Banister said. "That secondary guy comes in and it's a little more of an extended look in a sense, deeper into the game."	Sadzeck said it was "definitely different" but that he stuck to his normal routine he uses when relieving, including throwing only 10 to 15 warmup pitches in the bullpen.	"I approached it just as I would relieving," he said. "My job is to get us to the next inning, whether it's coming in in the middle of an inning or getting us to the sixth, getting us to the seventh. That's all I thought about was getting us to the second inning."	Banister said left-hander Alex Claudio will be the opener for right-hander Arial Jurado on Saturday night.	After hitting singles in his first two at-bats, Profar drove the first pitch he saw from Phil Maton into the seats in right with one out in the seventh, his 17th. He drove in two runs and scored twice in the matchup of last-place teams.	Profar also hit an RBI single in the second and singled and scored in the fifth on an odd play in which Myers, the Padres' third baseman, committed an error and had two putouts. Roughned Odor and Profar opened the fifth with singles. Isiah Kiner-Falefa grounded to Myers, who forced Odor before overthrowing first for an error that allowed Profar to score ahead of the throw home by first baseman Eric Hosmer. Mejia, the catcher, threw out Kiner-Falefa at third.	Padres starter Robbie Erlin (3-7) allowed two runs and six hits in 6 1/3 innings, struck out six and walked none.	"I thought there were some really good curveballs he threw today," manager Andy Green said. "That just has the ability to rock a hitter back and forth. ... It felt to me he used it strategically well and got hitters off of his fastball timing and was able to use the fastball and slider off of that."	BELTRE	Adrian Beltre doubled twice to extend his career hits total to 3,155, passing George Brett to take sole possession of 15th on the all-time list.	"How about that third baseman?" Banister said. "He continues to find barrels. Two doubles tonight. It's fun to watch and fun to watch the names that he's taking off that board."	UPOMING	Rangers: Claudio will open for RHP Ariel Jurado (2-5, 7.03).	Padres: LHP Eric Lauer (5-7, 4.80) is set to make his 21st start. He'll be one of just 20 rookies in Padres history to make 20 starts in a season. Along with fellow lefty Joey Lucchesi, it's just the fifth time the Padres have had two rookies make at least 20 starts.	Check out some of the most electric moments from Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s career.	Former Boston Red Sox left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and the Detroit Tigers are in agreement on a five-year deal worth $77 million, sources confirmed to ESPN.	From who we think deserves MVP and Cy Young to if the voters got it right, this is your one-stop shop as baseball's 2021 hardware is handed out.	Even Shohei Ohtani, arguably the best player in the major leagues, feels down at times, particularly when his team isn't winning.	The Marlins acquired Louis Head from the Rays on Sunday for either a player to be named later or cash.	Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright shows off his arm at a fair, nailing the dunk tank target in one try.

SAN FRANCISCO --  An 11-game losing streak wore on the San Francisco Giants, who had chances in many of those games and wound up on the wrong end.	Chris Stratton's first career shutout couldn't have come at a more opportune time to get his club out of a deep, weeks-long funk.	Stratton pitched a two-hitter, Austin Slater backed him with a two-run single, and San Francisco snapped its longest skid since 1951 by beating the Colorado Rockies 2-0 on Friday night.	"We're trying to get wins. We're not giving up," Stratton said. "It's just kind of been a tough little go right now but we're doing all we can to win games."	The NL West-leading Rockies had their division lead trimmed to a half-game over the Los Angeles Dodgers, who won at St. Louis. Colorado had its seven-game winning streak against San Francisco snapped.	Stratton (10-9) struck out seven and walked two, throwing 114 pitches to finish the 2-hour, 20-minute game. He allowed only one baserunner to reach second with Trevor Story getting there in the second.	"We just couldn't seem to square it up consistently," Rockies manager Bud Black said.	The right-hander has a career high in victories and became the Giants' first pitcher with double-digit wins since 2016 when Johnny Cueto, Madison Bumgarner and Jeff Samardzija got there. Those three star pitchers have dealt with injuries this season.	Stratton, who worked with former Giants righty Ryan Vogelsong when sent back down to Triple-A Sacramento and will be a contender for the rotation in 2019, retired nine straight during one stretch then his final 12 batters. He pitched the first Giants' shutout since Samardzija on Aug. 28, 2017, against San Diego.	While ending the longest skid of Bruce Bochy's managerial career -- he had a nine-game losing streak with San Diego in 2003 -- the Giants earned their first victory this month.	"It's great get off the schneid. I'm not going to lie, it wears on you, it does," Bochy said. "It was one of those streaks, it's hard to believe we were in the streak, to be honest, because we were in so many games."	The Giants ended their worst winless stretch since moving to San Francisco. They avoided what would have been just the fourth losing streak of 12 or more games in franchise history since 1883. They did so in 1944 with a 13-game skid and also in 1902 and 1900 -- all of them while playing in New York.	Tyler Anderson (6-9) hasn't won in 12 starts since beating the Giants on July 4, going 0-6 during that span with Colorado posting a 2-10 record during his outings.	Anderson's wild pitch in the second put runners on second and third before Slater's single. Anderson then struck out the side in order the next inning.	"If I don't throw a wild pitch there, we might still be playing," he said. "I might throw a double-play ball and we could still be going. But overall, in general, better."	He allowed two runs on seven hits in six innings, struck out six and didn't walk a batter.	"Tyler threw the ball much better," Black said. "I think you saw the command."	GIANTS MOVE	San Francisco dismissed seventh-year strength and conditioning coach Carl Kochan in what could be the beginning of a series of moves as another losing season winds down.	TRAINER'S ROOM	Giants: 1B Brandon Belt exited in the top of the seventh and said afterward his tender right knee "just got worse." He said he might need more days off, and Bochy agreed it could be necessary. "I'm concerned there," Bochy said. "We've got to be smart about this and see where he's at. You get caught in a diminishing return area, where you're starting a guy then he has to come out of the game."
